Unexplained absence: Somerset County Council chief executive Sheila Wheeler has stepped down with a £40,000 pay-off after being off work for the last three months at the height of the flooding crisis

A £160,000-a-year council boss who has been off work throughout the entire flood crisis which has engulfed her county has stepped down with a £40,000 pay off.

Somerset County Council chief executive Sheila Wheeler, 50, has been off on full pay for three months without a full public explanation during the area's biggest ever peace-time emergency.

She left the council 'by mutual agreement' after a meeting behind closed doors on Wednesday night - but still offered no public reason for her departure.

She will be paid three months' salary in lieu of notice amounting to £40,000 before tax.

The authority - which is making £30 million of cuts - has continually refused to confirm the reasons behind her absence.

Councillors said they had been threatened with legal action if they spoke about the matter.

Speaking earlier this week, Justine Baker, the Lib Dem councillor for Bishop's Hull ward, said: 'We know part of the reason, but not the full reason.

'But we've been told we're not allowed to tell anyone for legal reasons to the extent we could be individually liable for legal action.'

It was initially said Mrs Wheeler - who earned £18,000 per year more than the Prime Minister - was on sick leave.

But in January a statement simply said she was 'not in the office'.

It has been rumoured that her absence stems from a conflict with the Conservative leader of the council, John Osman.

Drawn into the row: On a visit to the county this week, David Cameron was asked whether it made sense for Mrs Wheeler to be off work on full pay during the crisis, with taxpayers in the dark over the reasons

Leaving them to it: Mr Cameron said Mrs Wheeler's absence was a matter for the council to sort out

But Independent investigators who were called in to look into complaints against a number of staff found 'no wrong-doing'.

A spokesman for the Conservative-led council said: 'We cannot go into further detail due to legal reasons.

'The reason the process has taken some time is because it was necessary to deal with a complaint that had been made against other individuals within the council.

'At the council’s request, the complaint was investigated by an independent QC who concluded that there was no wrong-doing by the individuals who were the subject of the complaint.

'We cannot go into details of that for legal reasons. The result though was an agreement that the CEO would leave the council by mutual agreement.

'We believe that this represents a sensible outcome for all concerned which will enable us to put the matter behind us and focus all our attention and energy on the important work of dealing with the ongoing floods.'

When David Cameron visited the flood-hit region on Wednesday, he was asked whether it made sense for Mrs Wheeler to be off work on full pay during the crisis, with taxpayers in the dark over the reasons.

He said: 'This is for Somerset County Council to sort out.

'This is a matter for them but I don’t want people to be in any doubt in Somerset about who is in charge.

'The Gold Commander has been in charge.

'Gold and Silver have worked very well to bring together all the agencies, councils emergency services, Environment Agency, the military and volunteers.

'I have seen it for myself. I think the police have led this extremely well and will carry on leading.'

The Liberal Democrat group walked out when the council went into private session to discuss Mrs Wheeler's future.

Afterwards Sam Crabb, Lib Dem group leader confirmed the walk-out but said: 'Confidentiality prevents me from saying more.'

It is understood that if agreement had not been reached disciplinary proceedings would have been ready to start.

Mrs Wheeler started work at the council in February 2010, coinciding with the first austerity measures and major budget cuts.

A spokesperson for the authority added: 'She led the council through a prolonged period where significant service and staffing reductions had to be made.

'Sheila has also brought major changes to the way the council operates and is run and we wish her well for the future.'

They said until a replacement is found, deputy chief executive Patrick Flaherty will serve as the acting chief executive.

He added: 'Pat has led the authority through the biggest crisis we have faced in decades with the current floods and has done so with considerable skill.'

Mrs Wheeler joined Somerset County Council after working in local government for Adur District Council, Surrey County Council and the London Borough of Hounslow.

Her time at Surrey also included a secondment to central government and she moved one of her authorities from a rating of 'weak' to 'excellent'.

Mrs Wheeler’s remuneration for 2012-2013 is listed as £160,000 in salary with an employer pension contribution of £21,600.

Mrs Wheeler declined to comment when approached at her £750,000 house near Creech St Michael, Somerset, today.

Mr Osman was unavailable when contacted by MailOnline, but he had declined to comment earlier this week.
