A family of five murdered two men and dissolved their bodies in acid baths at home - before flushing the leftover 'sludge' 
down the lavatory.

Police said the family are from Holland but used the house in Germany as a 'chop shop' to dispose of their victims, who they killed with an icepick and a semi-automatic gun.

An international manhunt is now underway after two of the killers went on the run in South America.

The horror house was only uncovered after neighbours complained of a 'peculiar' smell coming from the property in Tuddern, in Germany.

And police have not ruled out the 
possibility that there are more victims as they collect human remains 
from the sewerage system of the small town.

Revenge was the motive for the 
murders, said police.

Although a mother and her two adult sons have been
 arrested her husband and adult daughter have fled to South America, German police believe.

House of horror: The family used the house in Germany as a 'chop shop' to dispose of their victims, who they killed with an icepick and a semi-automatic gun

The family, who are Dutch but lived in Germany, was arrested after neighbours complained of a 'peculiar' smell emanating from the house.

'The
 case concerns a man who was shot and another who was hit with an 
icepick whose throat was slashed,' said public prosecutor Daniele Weymar
 in the German town of Tuddern not far from the Dutch border.

'We have found human remains.'

One victim was killed in Belgium. The first victim was Alan Gergeri, 24, an Iraqi who the family accused of homosexually raping one of their sons.  He was murdered in 2009.

The second man, Mohammed al Jader, 29, was cut down in a hail of bullets last year, allegedly for trying to blackmail the family.

The Dutch family from the town of Sittard in Limburg owned the horror-house in Germany and used it as the 'chop shop,' said police, where bodies were cut up and laid in the hydrochloric acid vats.

One police officer said; 'The house was a terrible sight.  Bone fragments and a green gloop were found at the bottom of these vast vats that were filled with acid.

'Fingers and feet bones have been found a mile away in the sewers.'  Gas masks were found in the house - used by the family as they poured the acid from barrels into the decomposing tanks.'

Hydrochloric acid is highly corrosive and in a highly diluted form is found in many household cleaners. Some 20 million tonnes of it are produced annually around the world.

A unique cross-border forensics operation is underway between Dutch, German and Belgian police that continues while Interpol scours for the missing family members who are thought to be in Venezuela.

Aachen chief prosecutor Robert Deller said jurisdiction in the case for prosecution has been turned over entirely to The Netherlands.
