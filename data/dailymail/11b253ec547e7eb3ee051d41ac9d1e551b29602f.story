A-list offspring: Jason Connery is returning to our screens in Celebrity MasterChef

Back in the Eighties, he became a television heart-throb as Robin Hood. 

Now Sir Sean Connery’s son Jason is returning to our screens, but with an apron instead of a bow and arrow … in Celebrity MasterChef. 

And the 51-year-old is not the only lesser-known relation of an A-lister to grace the line-up of this year’s cookery competition.

Sophie Thompson, the younger sister of Oscar-winning star Emma Thompson, is also taking part.

Miss Thompson, 51, is not as instantly recognisable as her sister but has had supporting roles in hits such as Four Weddings and a Funeral, Emma and Eat, Pray, Love.

In 1999, she won an Olivier award for her theatre work.

Connery junior, meanwhile, no longer has the flowing blond locks that won him so many fans in the 1986 series Robin of Sherwood, but has made a name for himself as an actor and director – despite never quite hitting the heights of James Bond.

The recent tenth series of MasterChef, hosted by John Torode and Gregg Wallace, was won by Ping Coombes. The celebrity version kicks off next month, with 13 episodes over six weeks.

And Kiki Dee – who topped the charts with her Elton John duet Don’t Go Breaking My Heart in 1976 – said she cannot wait to join the competition.

‘I’ve turned celebrity TV shows down over the years but I couldn’t resist the chance to meet John and Gregg and have a go,’ said the 67-year-old singer, who is touring the UK later this year.

Other contestants include former Made In Chelsea star Millie Mackintosh, 23; supermodel Jodie Kidd, 35; ex-Trinny & Susannah star Susannah Constantine, 51, and actors Christopher Biggins, 65, and Ken Morley, 71.
