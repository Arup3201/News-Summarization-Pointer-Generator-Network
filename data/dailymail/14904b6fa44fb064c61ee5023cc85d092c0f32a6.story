Manchester United winger Ashley Young said Louis van Gaal's new 3-4-3 formation worked 'perfectly' in the wake of their 7-0 win over LA Galaxy.

Young, who scored two late goals in the win in Pasadena, also reserved special praise for man of the match Ander Herrera.

Van Gaal opted to play three at the back for the whole 90 minutes, while he made nine changes at half-time, with only Herrera and Darren Fletcher playing the full match.

Young told MUTV: 'Sometimes in pre-season you can take your foot off the gas but it's a new team in a new formation which suited us perfectly.'

Speaking of £29million signing Herrera, who controlled the midfield all night long, Young added: 'He'll be happy with his performance and I'm sure the manager and staff will have also been delighted.

'It's not easy coming into the Man United side. Luke Shaw came in and did well too.’

Young was frozen out somewhat under David Moyes last season as United finished a well-below-par seventh in the Barclays Premier League, but the former Aston Villa and Watford man is determined to hit the ground running this time around.

He added: 'Last season was disappointing and we felt that as players. We were keen to get up and running in the first pre-season game to be ready for the first home game of the season.'

New beginnings: Young will be hoping for a much better season on a team and personal level
