'Drugs victim': Martha Fernback, 15, pictured here with her rabbit Bluebell, died after apparently taking ecstasy

A 15-year-old girl has died after allegedly taking a super-strength ‘pink ecstasy’ tablet.

Martha Fernback suffered a fatal 
cardiac arrest in a park after taking one of the tablets – which were 
said to be available nearby for just £3.

The schoolgirl is feared to be the 11th victim of the pills, known as Dr Death or PMA, so far this year.

Last night, as a 17-year-old boy was 
arrested on suspicion of supplying the drug, Martha’s grieving family 
said the loss of their ‘extraordinary, effervescent . . . beautiful 
girl’ had left them ‘utterly devastated’.

Parents were urged to warn children 
about the dangers of super-strength ecstasy tablets, with a family 
friend saying the pills were ‘everywhere’ in Martha’s home town of 
Oxford.

The friend of the girl’s mother urged 
parents on Facebook to ‘speak to your kids about drugs again’, saying: 
‘This beautiful 15-year-old died yesterday after taking one PMA pill.

‘Martha never thought she was going to
have a cardiac arrest and die. She never thought she would never see 
her mother again, hold her in her arms and kiss her . . . you get the 
picture.

‘My friend Anne-Marie Cockburn is 
broken and in total agony. She wants you to know about this drug that 
your kids can buy for £3 right in Oxford (it’s everywhere). Spare a few 
minutes and talk to your children, PLEASE.’

Mrs Cockburn, a freelance marketing consultant, paid tribute to Martha’s friends for their support.

She wrote on a Facebook tribute site: 
‘Thanks so much to all Martha’s friends, I am finding so much comfort in
reading your lovely messages about my girl. We all loved her so so 
much.’

Martha is believed to have been a GCSE pupil at The Cherwell School.

She had written online of ‘growing up 
in an inspirational city’ and her Facebook page shows she was an only 
child who loved rock band Arctic Monkeys.

Martha’s father Sean Fernbeck, 49, 
appears to have remarried and lives in Amsterdam with his wife Debra. He
works for satellite navigation firm Tom Tom.

The teenager was found on Saturday by a lake in Hinksey Park, South Oxford, which was packed in the hot weather.

Paramedics were called to the scene at 1.17pm. Sunbathers looked on in horror as they attempted CPR.

It is thought Martha took PMA, or pink
ecstasy, which is often sold as ecstasy but is much stronger. Like 
MDMA, it can cause a potentially fatal increase in body temperature.

She was airlifted to a specialised 
unit at the John Radcliffe Hospital, but was pronounced dead soon 
afterwards. Thames Valley Police last night said a 17-year-old boy was 
arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply a drug.

Police cordoned off the area where Martha collapsed and officers were seen examining clothes left on a bench.

The death comes days after it emerged a 19-year-old gym instructor died after taking an overdose of pink ecstasy.

Travis Barber, from Salford, greater 
Manchester, suffered a violent reaction and was so badly injured police 
thought he had been murdered.

A post-mortem examination found Travis died of a massive overdose of Paramethoxyamphetamine, known as PMA.

A man living near Martha’s 
end-of-terrace home in an Oxford suburb said: ‘There is a drugs problem 
around here. It is readily available for anyone to buy . . . not far 
from here.’

In a statement, her family said: 
‘Martha was the most extraordinary, effervescent human being and all her
family and friends felt so privileged to have known her.

‘We are all utterly devastated and have sought such comfort in the beautiful condolences we have received.’

Detective Inspector Brendan Murray 
said: ‘Our thoughts are very much with Martha’s family, who have been 
left  devastated and distraught.

‘We now understand Martha had taken a substance which she believed was MDMA.

‘I would strongly urge young people 
not to take or experiment with illegal drugs. They are extremely 
dangerous and often contain poisons.’

A post-mortem examination will be conducted today but toxicology test results are not likely to be known for weeks.

Last night around 100 of Martha’s friends met in Hinksey Park to remember her near the place where she died.
