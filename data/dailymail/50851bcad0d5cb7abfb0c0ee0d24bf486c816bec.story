Didier Drogba celebrated with his son Isaac in the Chelsea dressing room after scoring his first goal since returning to the club this summer.

The 36-year-old converted from the penalty spot - as he did with the last kick of his first spell at Stamford Bridge to win the European Cup - mid-way through the first half as Jose Mourinho's side beat Slovenian outfit Maribor 6-0 in the Champions League.

The Ivorian was joined by son Isaac as he and team-mates - including John Terry, Petr Cech and debutant Dominic Solanke - posed for a dressing-room snapshot after the match.

Drogba Snr only entered the match against Maribor after Loic Remy suffered a groin injury inside 15 minutes, and Mourinho says the plan was to only play the veteran striker for half an hour.

‘I was not expecting Didier to play 75 (minutes). I spoke with him yesterday and we spoke about 30. It was circumstances. He had to go on.

‘He was comfortable to play 75 minutes. It was very, very important for Didier. The best thing for a player to improve his condition is to play.

‘His last goal for Chelsea (in the Champions League final of 2012) was the most important goal in the history of the club.’

The win was Chelsea's biggest in the competition as they put six past Maribor, including a double from Eden Hazard and strikes from Loic Remy, John Terry plus an own goal.
