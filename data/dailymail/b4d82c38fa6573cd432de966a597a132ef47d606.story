It’s said that Rome wasn’t built in a day, but it seems that an entire city can be built from scratch in two years – in Minecraft, at least.

The popular video game, which may look to some like it was created in the 1980s, allows people to build any structure they can imagine using tiny virtual blocks.

Duncan Parcells, an art student at the University of Delaware, used 4.5 million blocks to create a metropolis resembling a scene from Sim City.

It’s called Titan City and it was created on the Xbox 360, from its intricately-designed buildings in different architectural styles, to the network of roads, trees and towering skyscrapers.

Mr Parcells said: ‘All the blocks were hand placed on the map’ using the games console. He didn’t have the PC version of the game, which would have made progress faster, Gizmodo reported.  

It took him two years to construct the Minecraft city, including many skyscrapers (pictured). The popular game, which may look to some like it was created in the 1980s, allows people to build any structure they can imagine from tiny virtual blocks

Minecraft was created by Markus Persson in 2009, before releasing it widely in November 2011.

Players of the game, which is available on PC and Xbox can walk around different terrains, fly and build models using little pixelated blocks.

It's the top online game on Xbox Live, with over two billion hours played on Xbox 360 in the last two years - and almost 17 million copies sold in total.

Last month, Microsoft snapped up Mr Persson's company, Mojang - and the game - for an estimated $2.5 billion (£1.5 billion).

There is an annual Minecraft convention - Minecon - which is set to continue.

Mr Persson will leave his company when the deal is finalised to conduct 'small web experiments'.

He said the decision to sell the company was 'not about the money. It's about my sanity.'

Now that he has a copy for his computer, he is going to move his creation permanently onto the PC so he can continue building at a faster rate.

In almost the same time that it has taken for Mr Parcells to build Titan City, almost 17 million people have bought a copy of Minecraft.

Minecraft was created by Markus Persson in 2009, before releasing it widely in November 2011.

Last month, he sold it to Microsoft for an estimated $2.5 billion (£1.5 billion).

To begin the game, players are put into a 'virtually infinite game world.'

They can then walk around different terrains, including mountains, forests and caves.

Players can also fly up in the air for a birds-eye view of the landscape.

They are given blocks and tools to build towns and cities. As a player progresses they can earn advanced tools and building blocks in different materials. 

Mr Parcells said: ‘All the blocks were hand placed on the map’ using the games console, because he didn't have the PC version of the game, which would have made progress faster - an amqazing achievement if you consider the intricacy of these buildings

Among the strange creations built so far in the gaming landscape, are a model of the USS Enterprise, as well as working 'computers' – and now, an iPhone.

The massive model was created by a German man and allows players to work it by jumping on the screen, PopSci reported.

The model can’t make calls but has functioning apps including a camera, YouTube, photos, a painting app and games including a slot machines and blackjack.
