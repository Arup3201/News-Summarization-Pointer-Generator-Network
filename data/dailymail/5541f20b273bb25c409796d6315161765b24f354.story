Voting conservative is contagious, a new report has found.

People moving to right wing areas are more likely to vote for the Tories, according to a new study.

Relocating to Tunbridge Wells, or another tradition Tory bolthole, will make you rightwing, the academic study has revealed.

The research analysed the political beliefs of the 10 per cent of Britons who move home each year.

People moving to Tory areas, such as Royal Tunbridge Wells (pictured) are more likely to vote Conservative a new study has found

It found that 'movers to safe 
Conservative seats became more economically rightwing and more likely to
 vote Conservative after the move', regardless of their political views 
before.

But the study found the same was not true for those moving to predominantly Labour areas.

Professor Patrick Sturgis, of the University of Southampton, told The Observer: 'If you move to Tunbridge Wells from Salford, on average, people become a bit more rightwing over time.

'It is the move that is causing the change, because the comparison is with people who don't move.

'Yet we don't find the same with people moving to Labour areas. We think the reason is that people who move to Labour areas are already pretty leftwing, so there is no space for movement.

'People who move to Tory areas are more variable in their politics.'

The report Places and Preferences: A Longitudinal Analysis of Self-Selection and Contextual Effects, reveals most safe Labour seats are in urban areas, including London, Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle and Liverpool.

While the study revealed voting for David Cameron's Conservative party is contagious, the same rule does not apply to people moving into predominantly Labour areas

Researchers concluded the social pressure to conform to the local majority might be less marked in socially diverse, urban areas than in rural or suburban areas, which area commonly more Tory.

The study asked more than 17,300 people who moved home between 1991 and 2008, questions over their political preference.

'Individuals who live in safe Conservative constituencies are likely to support the Conservative party even immediately after moving to their new place of residence,' the report states.

Professor Sturgis said people do not choose their location because of their political beliefs, but the effect of moving to a Tory areas appears to be that people will vote Conservative.

But the theory does not hold weight for those moving to more Labour areas
