A shocked nine-year-old girl found a dead maggot in a packet of Asda noodles after she had started tucking into the snack, it has been claimed.

Malika Carrington was said to have made the grim find in the supermarket's 25p noodles after they had been heated up in the microwave.

It was not know whether the grub was alive or dead when the instant chicken flavoured treat, which had been bought two weeks earlier, was heated up. 

It was claimed that nine-year-old Malika Carrington found the dead maggot after heating up a packet of Asda's instant noodles

'I couldn't believe it when Malika showed me,' said her mother Keisha Carrington, 28, from Longsight, Manchester. 

'She didn't realise what it was initially but I could see it was as maggot straight away.

'I was fuming. All I could think was how on earth did it get in there? It was so disgusting. Thank goodness she didn't eat it.'

After complaining, the supermarket offered to reimburse Ms Carrington 50p for the incident - 25p for the faulty packet plus an extra 25p for goodwill.

Keisha Carrington says her daughter has been put off noodles for life after making the discovery

The mum-of-two added: 'Normally my kids love noodles for a quick snack. But finding a dead maggot in her bowl was enough to put my daughter off noodles for life.

'I complained to Asda and they have asked me to take the packet and maggot back to the store so they can see what happened. 

'And then they said they would give me the money back for the packet of noodles plus an extra free.

'I'm sorry but I just don't think that's good enough. It's not like the good was faulty. 

It was not known whether the maggot was dead or alive when it was heated up in the microwave

'It was an actual maggot. We don't know whether it was alive or dead because by the time we realised what it was, it had been in the microwave for eight minutes.

'I just hope they found out where it came from so it doesn't happen to someone else.'

Asda have asked Ms Carrington to return the offending maggot and noodles so they can investigate.

An Asda spokesman said: 'We're very sorry for what's happened and have been in touch with Ms Carrington to ask her to return the product to store in order for us to carry out a full investigation.'
