We're a nation of hoarders, but Drew Pritchard might inspire you to take a closer look at your clutter. His TV show Salvage Hunters proves that junk can be priceless - if it has the 'X Factor'.

Drew, 43, is no ordinary antiques trader. He describes himself as a 'decorative salvage dealer', scouring collections and hoards everywhere from country houses to bric-a-brac shops, in search of things to renovate.

He has an eye for the pieces other dealers miss, and his discerning clients - who include fashion designer Ralph Lauren, chef Marco Pierre White and Hollywood star Jim Carrey - trust his taste in the unusual.

Drew Pritchard on the hunt for hidden treasures

A typical Drew find might be a rusty arc lamp or a vintage barber's shop chair... or even part of a building, such as a gargoyle.

He got his eye for art from his father, a painter who taught him about perspective, scale and form. 'I still can't paint,' he admits with a laugh, 'but I can look at something and know at a glance whether it's right or wrong.'

He insists he never overthinks what to buy. 'It's very organic, I just let it happen,' he says.

At 15 he set out on a lifelong treasure hunt, learning how to find buyers and turn a profit. He and his wife Rebecca now sell all over the world from their warehouse in Conwy, North Wales, and in January they opened a stand at the Liberty department store on Regent Street in London.

'This is the best job in the world. I 
get to wander round beautiful buildings, and buy something wonderful. I own it for a 
brief space of time and then I make my living out of it.'

'That was a fluke,' Drew says. 'The head buyer of Liberty called into my warehouse when he was on holiday. He didn't even know I had a TV show!'

Most antiques traders are well aware of Drew's television fame - this week sees the start of the show's fourth series - and that creates its own problems.

'I don't mind getting recognised, and
 it doesn't really push the prices up - in fact, some people want to 
strike a deal just because they love the show. But I do end up with 
things I sometimes didn't intend to buy, because so many youngsters 
approach me with their discoveries. They've found something unusual, and
 I want to encourage their passion for antiques, so we end up haggling 
and I end up paying. That's OK, because it's helping to shape the next 
generation of salvage hunters.'

The
 new series sees Drew uncover an Aladdin's cave above a Shropshire pub, 
where the landlord has been collecting oddities for 50 years. 'I'm a 
hoarder,' confesses Alan East, 77, who  runs The Yew Tree Inn.

'It
 goes back to the war - you didn't throw anything away.' The rooms 
upstairs, which once might have been let by the night to travellers, are
 now over-stuffed museums packed with the unexpected... such as a 
19th-century three-cornered hat with ostrich plumes, and a velveteen 
dress uniform that would not have looked out of place on the cover of 
The Beatles' Sgt Pepper album.

But Drew's eye picks out an oak box that contains a bizarre Edwardian apparatus for delivering electric shocks to treat psychiatric illnesses. It's just the sort of puzzling contraption, all cables and dials with brass levers, that might turn up in any junk shop with a £5 tag... but the right buyer might pay a hundred times that.

That nose for a bargain uncovers all sorts of unlikely gems. In a barn on the grounds of a Georgian manor house in Wales, Drew sees a battered armchair lying upside down. Its stuffing is slashed and two legs have snapped off - most people would take one look and sling it on a bonfire, but Drew pays £150.

Even his wife thinks he's taken leave of his senses, until it emerges from his renovation workshop with all four legs. Suddenly, the chair is a classic, and worth an estimated £550.

He has to be quick off the mark to find the best pieces, and be prepared to go wherever the treasure is hidden.

'Last week I got an email from a friend about a mill in Halifax, with some photos of carts made out of pony skins - huge square things, with massive cast iron wheels, 160 years old. We were there next morning and bought 16. You've got to get in the car, know what they're worth to you and have the money ready. The only downside is the amount of driving - it's often five hours on the road.'

On a visit to Kevin Marshall, who runs what some say is Britain's best junk shop in Kingston upon Hull, Drew falls in love with a chair from a traditional barber's shop.

It's child-sized and decorated with a metal horse's head to keep young customers amused while they were getting a short back and sides. Kevin is reluctant to part with it, but Drew knows that many visitors to his stand at Liberty would happily pay £1,500 to buy it for their own young family. A deal is soon sealed.

'I'm so lucky,' Drew enthuses. 'This is the best job in the world. I get to wander round beautiful buildings, see antique collections that are like time capsules, and buy something wonderful. I own it for a brief space of time and then I make my living out of it.'

So next time you think of clearing out your attic, just remember - one man's junkyard is another man's fortune.
