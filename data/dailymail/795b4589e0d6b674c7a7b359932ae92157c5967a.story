For most couples who are planning their wedding day, building a pirate ship to host the ceremony on is not near the top of their list of things to do.

However, an Illinois man is busy putting the finishing touches to a pirate ship he has built in his front yard after convincing his fiancee to let him realize his boat-building dreams.

Tony Miller and Kaela Schenk are due to get married on board the boat, which sits in a pond the couple dug in the garden of their Rockton home, next month.

Miss Schenk said she had never taken her fiance's boat ambitions seriously, but when he suggested it for their Caribbean-themed wedding it seemed like the perfect idea.

'I always wanted to get married outside,' she told ABC News. 'So one thing led to another, and we bought the backhoe to start digging for the pond.'

However, the couple's plans were nearly 
scuppered by Winnebago county officials who said they lacked the right 
permit for such a structure.

'When I approached them, they said, "We 
can’t do anything because we have nothing for pirate ships",' Mr Miller said. 'But now they do. It’s called an "accessory structure".’

Although work had to temporarily stop
while the permit issue was resolved, Mr Miller says he has been given 
the full backing of the county, which worked hard to help him fix the 
paperwork.

'We are 100 per cent behind them. I 
think it’s a wonderful thing,' Jim Hughes, director of development 
services for Winnebago County, said.

'A lot of people in the community
appreciate the ship, and the reason behind it is quite meaningful.'

Mr Miller added: 'It’s something I’ve always wanted to 
build. Something really unique and big and I could 
tinker around with for a while.'

The 35-year-old, who proposed to his fiancee last May, added that he wakes up smiling every day because his dream has come true.

He added that before building the 23ft high, 53ft long ship, which is attached to a concrete platform and has been named U.S. Mutiny, he had no ship building experience.

'I didn't know anything about ships, but I studied them a lot and it was fun to do,'  he told ABC57. 'It was a hobby of mine in the winter. I took different types of ships and collaborated my favorite parts of each ship into one.'

Ship shape: Although the couple will marry on the ship, the wedding will not have a pirate theme

The final design, which is a combination of  a galleon and a frigate, will be able to hold about 30 people.

'It's definitely over the top. I definitely always wanted an outside wedding, but definitely never pictured being married on a pirate ship,' Miss Schenk said, adding that the ship is the only pirate element to their wedding on August 3.

'My mom asked to 
bring eye patches to the wedding and I said, "No! The pirate ship is 
enough". I want flowery, and pretty. I don’t people there with swords 
acting like Jack Sparrow, she said.
