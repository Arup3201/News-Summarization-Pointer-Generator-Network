A property in Scotland so filthy neighbours named it 'Steptoe House' has been sold for £100,000 despite the council spending more than £30,000 cleaning it up before auction. 

The four-bedroom home in Monikie, Angus, descended into squalor over ten years during which Angus Council pleaded with its residents - a couple jailed for committing fraud - to clear some of its clutter. 

Once Alexander and Moira Ewart were released from jail for plundering the estate of an elderly relative, officials implemented an enforcement action and began clearing the site, using a 40-tonne crane to remove cars and boats from its grounds.

The house in Monikie, Angus, was so filthy neighbours nicknamed it the Steptoe House after a sitcom about poverty and squalor 

The property descended into squalor when its residents were both jailed for 18 months after being convicted of fraud offences

The council implemented two enforcement actions to the cost of around £30,000 including interest following complaints from other residents

But despite spending £32,000 on tidying the grounds, there may not be any money left over from the sale of the property once other creditors are reimbursed. 

Chief among them is Halifax Bank of Scotland which has security over the property. 

'Together with the sequestration fees I don't think there will be very much to be realised towards the council and there are other avenues we could explore regarding the recovery of the debt,' said a senior council official said. 

'The secure creditor is Halifax Bank of Scotland who has the security over the property. My understanding is that security will swallow up most of the amount that was recovered from the sale.' 

Angus Council officials intervened when the Ewarts failed to clear the property after their 18-month jail sentences in 2005. 

A 40-tonne crane had to be brought to the property for officials to remove cars and boats that were rotting in its grounds 

Angus Council used more than 20 skips to clear some of the rubbish during two enforcement actions in 2007 and 2009 after the residents failed to clear up the clutter 

It is thought the couple handed over ownership of the house to their son, who was declared bankrupt earlier this year 

Dirty clothes and towels hang in the cluttered garden at the home described by one councillor as the Steptoe House for its filth 

Bankruptcy officials sought permission to list the house for sale at auction, with an anonymous buyer offering £100,000 for the property last month 

2005: Alexander and Moira Ewart are both jailed for 18 months after plundering estate of elderly relative 

2007: Angus Council imposes an enactment action to clear property costing around £16,000 

2009: A second action is taken to improve the state of the property, adding another £13,000 to council's bill 

August 2014: The property is listed with Future Property Auctions after KPMG bankruptcy officials receive permission from court to sell house 

September 2014: The home is sold for £100,000. Angus Council officials remain hopeful they will see some of the money spent on the house returned through proceeds of the sale 

October 2014: At a council meeting it is suggested that no funds will be reimbursed, with the security holder Halifax first in line to receive cash from the sale 

The house has been known to local residents as the Steptoe House since a councillor remarked it was similar to the squalor depicted in the television series, Steptoe and Son. 

The BBC programme, which began in 1962, tells the story of a British man Harold Steptoe (played by Harry H. Corbett) and his father, Alfred Steptoe (played by Wilfrid Brambell) who run a rag'n'bone business in London and live in abject poverty. 

It ended in 1974 after four popular series.   

In 2007, more than 20 skip-loads of rubbish were removed from the garden after it was described by a councillor as looking like a scene from the television programme Steptoe and Son.

The effort cost more than £16,000, with interest rates adding another £3,000 to the bill.  A second clear-up was carried out in 2009 to the tune of a further £13,000. 

The couple then transferred the property to their son, who was declared bankrupt. In September it was listed by Future Property Auctions, which said the property would require 'a degree of refurbishment prior to habitation.'

Despite selling for three times as much as what was spent by the local authority, the majority of proceeds from the sale will be used to settle unpaid tax and bank bills.   

Angus Council declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline.
