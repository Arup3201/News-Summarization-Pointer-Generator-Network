Bolton chairman Phil Gartside and the club’s former manager Sammy Lee have both been told to appear in court on February 25 to answer allegations of perjury and fraud.

As revealed by Sportsmail's Charles Sale last week, the two are among 11 parties who have been summoned to appear in front of Newcastle magistrates’ court as a result of private prosecutions being brought by football agent Tony McGill.

The claims are the latest twist to a legal battle which goes back to 2007 when Bolton signed Gavin McCann from Aston Villa for £1million, and McGill claimed that he was cut out of the deal at the last minute when Bolton brought in the sports agency SEM.

The agent lost that case at Manchester civil justice centre last September, but is now attempting to bring private prosecutions, and has received the go ahead for court summonses to be issued.

Others facing allegations include former Bolton director of football Frank McParland, now taking the same role at Brentford, and Bolton’s long serving secretary Simon Marland. 

Jerome Anderson, the chief executive of SEM, is summoned on four allegations of perjury and one of fraud.
