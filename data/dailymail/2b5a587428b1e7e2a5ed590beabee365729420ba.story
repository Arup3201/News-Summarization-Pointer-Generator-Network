A vacant luxury house appears on the verge of tumbling 75 feet into a Central Texas lake because a cliff is collapsing beneath the property.

WFAA-TV in Dallas-Fort Worth reported Wednesday that the 4,000 square-foot-home above Lake Whitney has been condemned and the owners evacuated about two weeks ago.

Hill County Sheriff's Office Chief Deputy Mark Wilson says another chunk of cliff broke off on Tuesday night.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

About to drop? A luxury house teeters on a cliff about 75 feet above Lake Whitney in Whitney, Texas where homeowners have been forced to evacuate and watch their $700,000 mansion crumble

The 4,000 square-foot-home was condemned a year ago after people noticed a crack in the cliff below about a year ago

Soil and other debris have been falling from beneath the home at White Bluff Resort, some 60 miles south of Fort Worth. Tax records show the house was built in 2007 and is worth more than $700,000.

Neighbors Connie Ash and Jackie McNamara live across the lake and told reporters that they heard a cliff crash into the water at around 6:30 p.m yesterday.

'I immediately thought it was an earthquake or blasting; it was loud, really loud,' said Connie Ash said.

'And then I saw smoke, dust, water... I don't know, it was a huge cloud of stuff.'

'You used to look flush at the roof but then I could see it was somewhat down,' she said.

'You could see it... more and more of the top of the house that's moved. You're looking through the binoculars, just watching it.'

WFAA-TV published aerial photos of the home which show a massive hole under the center of the house. Huge fissures could also be seen on a nearby cliff.

A sign reading, 'EXTREME DANGER, STAY OFF PREMISES,' greeted visitors in the front yard.

The Hill County Sheriff said that people noticed a crack in the cliff about a year ago and that afterwards the house was condemned.

The owners of the crumbling mansion evacuated two weeks ago and they've moved all their things out.

The Sheriff told reporters that the home was shifting quickly on Tuesday night and there's no knowing is the house will fall down with it.

Soil and Debris can be seen hanging from the nearly dilapidated luxury home.

Despite not being able to live in the home, the owners will be responsible for the clean-up. The owners also have an address in Aubrey so this house may be their vacation home.
