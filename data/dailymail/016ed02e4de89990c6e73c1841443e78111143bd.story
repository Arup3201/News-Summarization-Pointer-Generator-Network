Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers believes Daniel Sturridge will never be considered one of the best strikers in Europe until he starts playing more regularly.

The forward hasn't featured since August, making just three Premier League appearances before getting injured on England duty.

Sturridge scored 22 goals and struck up a lethal strike partnership with Luis Suarez last term as Liverpool finished second behind Manchester City.

However, manager Rodgers believes the former City and Chelsea forward needs to play more consistently before he is considered one of the best frontmen on the continent.

'He won’t become a top European striker until he plays consistently. It doesn’t matter about potential. You have to play,' said Rodgers.

Liverpool have missed Sturridge's goals and Rodgers is keen to get the striker back in the team and scoring.

'Top players have such an influence on the team,' said Rodgers. 'When you are under the cosh, you know that you have strikers who can score out of nothing.

'When you have that as a team, it is a big weapon. Sturridge is one of them. That is where we aim to get with Daniel.'

Despite missing the last two months of the season, the Liverpool boss is confident Sturridge will be firing on all cylinders when he makes his comeback.

Last season's lethal strike partnership of Luis Suarez and Sturridge contributed  53 Premier League goals

'When he comes back into the team, you will see the confidence because of the movement and the dynamic. But he isn’t fit and he hasn’t been for a long time.'

Also without Suuarez - who joined Barcelona in the summer, Liverpool have struggled to reach last season's heights so far this campaign and Rodgers added: 'He (Sturridge) isn’t fit and he hasn’t been for a long time. We just have to work without and while we are doing that, we are staying up and around the top end of the table.

'Everyone can see our conditions are different to work in this season. The players are working their best.'
