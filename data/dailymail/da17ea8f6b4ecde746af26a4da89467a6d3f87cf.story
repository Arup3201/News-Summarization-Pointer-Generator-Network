Speaking with police: Bardstown High School principal Chris Pickett has been identified as a 'person of interest' in the theft of $26,000 in rare bourbon

A high school principal has been named a 'person of interest' in the theft of $26,000 in rare bourbon from a Kentucky distillery last week.

Bardstown High School principal Chris Pickett was identified after allegedly trying to sell a 'large quantity' of Pappy Van Winkle to a liquor store on Sunday afternoon — a claim he denies.

Pickett's lawyer, Doug Hubbard, said his client was a liquor collector who merely asked clerks at Elizabethtown's Packages and More Liquors whether any Pappy was available.

He said Pickett told the store’s manager he 'had quite a bit and wanted to add to his collection.'

However, store owner Eric Hall claims Pickett, identified in surveillance footage, tried to offload the premium liquor.

'He talked to my manager [Ben Beach], offered to sell some to my employee, or us, and my employee stated he couldn't buy it except from a distributor,' Hall told WDRB.com. 'The man kind of turned around, clammed up and left.'

Hall said it was 'ironic' someone would try to offload a product reported stolen just five days earlier.

Pickett met with police on Monday.

Franklin County Sheriff Pat Melton said Pickett was 'very cooperative'.

'There’s still a conflict in the story there,' said Melton. 'Nobody has been ruled out now [as a person of interest].'

About
65 cases of the 20-year-old bourbon were reported missing from Buffalo 
Trace Distillery, in Frankfort, last week.

The bourbon retails 
for about $130 a bottle and is worth $300 to $400 a bottle on the 
secondary market.

According to The Atlantic Wire, only about 7,000 cases of Pappy Van Winkle are bottled each year, meaning 'it’s gone in recent years from a niche item favored by a cult of bourbon connoisseurs to an object of fervor, hunted by an ever-growing number of devotees the way Paris pursued Helen of Troy.'

Melton said authorities were originally investigating the heist as an inside job.

The bourbon was stored in a secure area to which at least 50 employees have access.

Meanwhile, Pickett's lawyer Hubbard said his client was not a thief and could never pull off such a large-scale heist.

'Chris has never been there [the distillery]. Chris 
knows of no one who works there,' Hubbard told The State Journal.

'Those places aren’t somewhere that everybody walks in and out of there,
carrying whatever they want.'

Hubbard said Pickett has been 
principal at Bardstown High School for three years, but has worked
at the school for 15 years.

He said Pickett was in 'absolute shock' when he heard he was a person of interest.

'Certainly
he’s always concerned about his reputation and bewildered why anyone 
would make these accusations against him,' Hubbard said. 'But we’re 
trying in good faith to be cooperative.'
