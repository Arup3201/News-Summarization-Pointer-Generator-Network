A young couple who survived the deadly gun attack at the Aurora movie theater last July are to mark the shooting by marrying a year to the day that it took place.

Kristin Davis and Eugene Han were among the 58 people wounded when alleged shooter James Holmes opened fire 18 minutes into the screening of the new Batman film on July 20, 2012.

Mr Han, 21, was shot in the knee and hip in the attack, and Miss Davis suffered scratches after her boyfriend pushed to safety.

The childhood friends have vowed to not let the attack, which killed 12 people, ruin their future lives together.

Miss Davis plans to wear her future mother-in-law's dress when the couple marry.

Mr Han told Denver Channel: 'Most days I remember it like it was yesterday. Why not make it a better day?'

The couple want to reclaim the anniversary of the shooting with a positive memory so decided to hold their wedding on July 20.

'We were talking about that word "anniversary". Honestly, I don't think it should be used for the theater
shooting. It's not a good day,' Mr Han told the station.

The couple had been dating for two 
years when they went to the midnight screening of the new Batman 
film with three friends at the Century 16 theater.

Mr Han said he thought he was going to be killed as soon as the shooting began. He still has bullet fragments inside his body.

Holmes is charged with 166 counts of murder and attempted murder, 
and prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. Holmes's lawyers say he 
wants to plead not guilty by reason of insanity.

If the judge accepts the new plea, 
Holmes would be sent to the state mental hospital, where doctors would 
determine whether he was insane at the time of the July 20 shootings.

Investigation: Police search the suspected gunman's car outside the movie theater in Aurora, Colorado

Holmes was 24 when he carried out his attack in the packed movie theater. He had recently dropped out of his PhD in neuroscience at the University of Colorado in Denver and had been seeing a university psychologist.

Witnesses said that about 20 minutes into the film a man wearing a gas mask and bullet-proof vest walked into the theater and started firing into the crowd.Â 

As the audience tried to run for cover, the gunman was said to have continued to fire calmly into the crowd with an assault rifle, handgun and shotgun.

His youngest victim was six-year-old Veronica Moser, whose 25-year-old mother was seriously injured in the shooting.

The former student had also allegedly left explosive devices at his home.
