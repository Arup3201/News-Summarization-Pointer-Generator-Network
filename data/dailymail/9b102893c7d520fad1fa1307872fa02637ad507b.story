A newlywed who gushed about her marriage on Facebook has been charged with murdering her husband a week after shooting him seven times.

Ashley Hunter, 27, is now on suicide watch in jail in Warren County, Missouri after apparently jumping out of a car and running in front of an ambulance as she made her way to the jail. 

On January 15, she called 911 just before 8pm and when sheriff's deputies arrived at her home in St Louis, they found her husband, 29-year-old Nicholas Hunter, dead on their living room floor.

He had been shot seven times, police said.

Mrs Hunter told deputies she and her husband had got into a physical altercation so she shot him, while two children, ages five and seven, were at the home.

The children are now in the care of a relatives and Mrs Hunter was taken to hospital for evaluation.

She was then taken to the Warren County jail on Friday but was released later that day pending the outcome of the investigation.

But after further investigations, police said that evidence gathered at the scene and in an autopsy contradicted her story, the St Louis Post-Dispatch reported.

Court documents say the couple had been arguing before she went upstairs, retrieved a gun and then shot him in the chest. No further details were made available.

His death came just 11 days after she gushed about her husband on Facebook. The couple married less than a year ago, Sheriff Kevin Harrison told the Warren County Record.

Loved up: Just 11 days before her husband's death, she took to Facebook to gush about their 'fairytale'

'I am blessed to be married to my best friend,' she wrote as she shared photos of them together. 

'Our love grows more and more everyday. We have our own fairytale and a marriage built around God. I love this man!!'  

On Thursday, she was charged with first-degree murder and criminal action, and her bail was set at $1 million.

She was being driven to the jail to answer to the charges when the car pulled over near the scene of a car crash on I-70, the Warren County Record reported. 

Mrs Hunter jumped out of the car and ran in front of an ambulance, according to police.

She was not seriously injured but was taken to hospital. She is now at the Warren County Jail.

Her husband's obituary says he was the father to a seven-year-old girl and three-year-old boy, and he was a member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
