A new Urban Outfitters store opening soon in Brooklyn, New York, will also have a bar inside.

According to the Brooklyn Community's Monday night board meeting notes, the new Williamsburg location was among the borough's bars and restaurants applying for a full liquor license.

And it's not the first time the retailer has expanded to food and drink; a shop in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, has a cafeteria-style eatery inside, and the company's Westport, Connecticut, location serves up fancy dishes like lamb merguez and striped sea bass at its in-store restaurant.

Shop and drink: A new Urban Outfitters location coming soon to Brooklyn, New York, is applying for a full liquor license for an in-store bar - and perhaps a restaurant, too

Wendy McDevitt, president of Terrain - the outdoor living company run by Urban Outfitters - said adding food to the retailer's repertoire will be a guaranteed way of getting more business.

'Food is becoming bigger and bigger in terms of entertainment value,' she told New York Magazine.

The new restaurant-cum-clothing store trend was initiated by Tommy Bahama, whose flagship Manhattan shop also has a full bar and a tropical-themed restaurant.

Installing the restaurant in their shop has not only been convenient for shoppers, but it has also been a very lucrative move for the clothing company.

In fact, chief executive officer Terry Pillow told Bloomberg Businessweek that Tommy Bahama's restaurant-stores generate two-and-a-half times the sales per square foot of their locations without food.

J.C. Penney is also reportedly looking to get in on the craze by adding juice bars to hundreds of its locations over the next few years.

Doug Wood, president of Tommy Bahama, says a bar within a shop is risky, but worth it. 'It's challenging to operate but if you execute it right it's magic,' he explained.

It has not yet been revealed when the new Urban Outfitters shop will be open to the public.
