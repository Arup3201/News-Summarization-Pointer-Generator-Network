Payout: Abdul Musa (pictured) blew the whistle on racism at the Canterbury Street sorting office and was sacked in 2007

A postman has received a £100,000 payout after he exposed 'endemic racism' at his sorting office where Asian workers were labelled 'cockroaches' and 'vermin'.

Abdul Musa blew the whistle on problems at the Canterbury Street sorting office where he worked in 
Blackburn, Lancashire between 2006 and 2007.

Asian workers, including Mr Musa, were 
labelled ‘cockroaches’ ‘vermin’ and ‘P***s’, an employment tribunal heard, and an 
Italian worker also received racial slurs and was dubbed a ‘greasy 
b******’.

But following Mr Musa's complaints he was accused of a string of ‘quite incredible’ racial and sexual counter-accusations, and sacked in early 2007.

Postal worker Christopher Eccles was also sacked, as a result of the ongoing abuse, and 12 colleagues were later disciplined.

The episode prompted strike action at 
the delivery office over Mr Eccles's sacking and the graffiti ‘Kill The P****’ appeared in a 
staff toilet, the tribunal was told.

Now a judge has ruled that Mr Musa was racially victimised by his colleagues and the judge blasted Royal Mail's investigation into his slurs as 'shambolic'.

He said that Mr Musa had
been unfairly dismissed in July 2007 and upheld his racial discrimination 
claims.

The findings of a five-day tribunal, held in Manchester in January 2012, have only now been made public.

The Equality Commission attacked Royal
Mail for failing to protect Mr Musa, from Burnley, following efforts by
a union and fellow staff to drive him out.

In a statement the Commission said: 
'The tribunal found that managers at the depot in Blackburn had known 
endemic racism was an issue, but failed to act to protect Mr Musa.'

Tribunal judge Mrs C Porter said it was ‘quite startling’ that the graffiti’s origins were then never investigated.

Mrs Porter added: 'The procedure adopted by the respondent (Royal Mail) for the investigations and disciplinary action was shambolic.'

An internal Royal Mail inquiry, conducted by an independent investigator, Neil Donovan, decided that Mr Musa, who is of Indian origin, was racially, verbally, and physically harassed by more than a dozen colleagues.

Concerns were also raised by the judge about the actions of the Communication Workers Union in ‘priming’ and ‘intimidating’ witnesses, during a series of internal inquiries.

But the findings of a later Royal Mail
investigation into the wider issues identified at the Blackburn office,
was said to have not been made available to the tribunal by the 
company.

The tribunal ruled
Mr Musa’s continuing employment was seen as a ‘problem’ by Royal Mail, 
‘which was resolved by his dismissal.’

The
tribunal heard how one worker, accused of mimicking Asian colleagues, 
was sacked and three colleagues were suspended after an internal probe 
at the Blackburn office.

Mr Musa was himself sacked in 2007 after a counter-allegations were made against him by colleagues.

Giving evidence, he denied calling fellow Asian postal workers ‘cockroaches and vermin’ and several sexual misconduct claims.

The episode pushed the Blackburn 
sorting office to the brink of strike action in support of the sacked 
postman, Christopher Eccles, and three suspended colleagues.

Mr
Musa alleged that he was ‘sent to Coventry’, in 2006 and 2007, and 
repeatedly complained to management that he was being isolated and 
ignored by workmates.

He claimed he was called by a colleague, whose voice he recognised, late at night and told: 'You want to watch your back.'

The
former postman accused Royal Mail of failing to support him, after he 
made his original complaint, and breaching his confidentiality.

He said details of his claims were handed around the sorting office for others to read, leading to further intimidation.

Mr
Musa told the hearing: 'None of my Asian colleagues stopped talking to 
me. If it had not been for their support the affect on my health would 
have been even worse.'

He claimed the allegations against him were an ‘act of revenge’ by colleagues after he highlighted racist culture at the sorting office.

John Wadham, a former director of Liberty and now general counsel for the EHRC, said: 'The fact that his colleagues were acting unlawfully was not enough to stop them from victimising Mr Musa.

'People facing discrimination also need an advocate, such as the Commission, to make sure that the law is obeyed.'

The EHRC funded Mr Musa’s case after his previous legal representation withdrew from the proceedings.

A Royal Mail spokesman said: 'There is no room in Royal Mail for racism or any other form of discrimination. We are committed to investigating any complaint of discrimination fairly and thoroughly.'
