Scam: Patricia Glancy conned five couples who were getting married at Wentworth Golf Club

A wedding planner who stole £11,000 from couples marrying at one of Britain's top golf clubs has avoided jail because she spent the money on a friend who was dying of cancer

Patricia Glancy, 36, conned five couples into leaving blank cheques with Wentworth Golf Club in Surrey, which she would then cash into her own bank account.

Although she admitted stealing the money, Glancy was spared prison after it emerged she spent it on taking her dying friend Thelma Harte on holiday to New York, as well as on large donations to cancer charities.

Glancy stole a total of £10,787.50 pounds between March 1 and June 6 last year, and had resigned shortly before the con was discovered by golf club bosses.

The scheme was was finally detected when a bride emailed the club about her wedding preparations - only to be told she had not put down a deposit and the organiser had left.

Judge Peter Moss, sitting at Guildford Crown Court today sentenced Glancy to six months in prison, suspended for 18 months.

The court heard she had paid back every penny of the stolen money and that the golf club had honoured the weddings of all couples that fell victim to the scam.

During the trial Judge Moss was handed 'proof' Glancy used to the cash to pay for a trip to New York for a friend, Thelma Harte, who was dying of cancer.

Ms Harte is believed to have died before the scam was detected.

Glancy also provided evidence that she had used the rest of the money to buy goods from the golf club’s shop, which were sold as items at charity auctions to raise money for two cancer hospices.

'Wentworth Golf Club picked up, as you would expect of a reputable organisation, the costs to fulfill their obligations that fell through because of your fraud. You risked damaging their reputation because of your actions,' said Judge Moss.

'You fully admitted this matter and I bear in mind you are 36 years of age and of good character.

'Your best friend was dying of cancer 
and you wanted to provide trips for her to New York and you also 
mentioned you had given donations to charity events for two particular 
hospices, Judge Moss added.

'You certainly had
 bought equipment from the professional shop - at a discount no doubt - 
with some of the proceeds you had taken from your customers.

'I saw evidence you had been engaged in those charity events. It attracted, for you personally, a considerable amount of praise and admiration from family and friends. That may well have been the motivation for you.'

Glancy, from Ascot in Berkshire, admitted five counts of fraud by false representation at an earlier court appearance.

Judge Moss said her crimes deserved custodial punishment but decided to suspend her six-month prison sentence for 18 months.

The judge told Glancy that she would immediately serve the six-month term if she committed any further crimes in the next 18 months.

He also ordered that she paid £350 pounds costs.

Prosecutor Trina Little had earlier told the judge how Glancy worked at Wentworth Golf Club, near Virginia Water, Surrey, from January 16, 2012 to May 31 last year as club’s events sales manager.

She said: 'She was tasked to arrange wedding receptions for people getting married at the club and liaised with the parties in doing so.'

'Miss Glancy was asking for deposits. On four of the counts the parties paid by cheques. They left them blank and she said she would stamp them with the Wentworth Golf Club stamp.'

'She completed her name and details.'

One payment was made by bank transfer - but instead of giving the club’s details to the couple, Glancy gave her own account number, the prosecutor said.

Lisa Patel and Mo Maan had just under £1,940 pounds diverted without their knowledge.

Lauren Sandford’s father wrote a cheque for £2,650 pounds as a deposit for his daughter’s wedding to Gary Kearton.

A further cheque for an almost identical sum for Daniella Field and Matt Joy’s reception failed to land in the club’s account.

Then £1,239 pounds for Nikki Hitchmore and Hooverney Martinez’s big day was taken, before Nadine Maraj and Shiraz Sharif had just over £2,300 pounds vanish into Glancy’s account.

The frauds, which were carried out between March 1 and June 6, 2013, were exposed by an investigation launched after Lisa Patel tried to send Glancy an email, only for a message to bounce back saying she had left the club.

Wentworth honoured the payments to make sure the weddings went ahead as planned.

Glancy’s defence counsel Robert Spencer-Bernard told the judge that his client was 'genuinely remorseful' and had paid back the full amount to Wentworth.

The judge had deferred Glancy’s sentencing hearing last month to give her time to prove she had spent the money on charitable causes, and to repay the cash.
