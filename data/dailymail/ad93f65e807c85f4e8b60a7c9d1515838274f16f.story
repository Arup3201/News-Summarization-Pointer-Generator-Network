CLICK HERE to see the top 10 shirtless goal celebrations of all time 

They are the men who are happy to pick up a booking in return for a public outing of their prized pecs and bulging biceps. The men who spend hours in the gym perfecting their sculpted physiques.

Southampton’s Dusan Tadic became the latest member of football’s Mr Muscle club when he ripped off his shirt following his winner at Old Trafford, unveiling his toned torso in front of 75,000 onlookers.

It barely touched 5C at Old Trafford on Sunday and the Southampton substitute had only been on the pitch for five minutes, but that didn’t deter him from braving the biting north-west air.

Tadic is joining a muscle-bound band of brothers, Cristiano Ronaldo, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Alexis Sanchez and Mario Balotelli among those never shy to showcase their upper body. But is it all one big vanity project? Is there any advantage to be gained by spending as much time in the gym as on the training pitch?

Mark Leather is head of performance at Bolton Wanderers and an authority on the physical conditioning of footballers. He told Sportsmail that players such as Tadic and Ronaldo must be applauded.

‘There is some debate as to whether the motivation with these players is cosmetic or for fitness and strength reasons,’ he said. ‘But what they are doing is getting the very best out of their bodies and allowing themselves to perform to the maximum of their ability.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic is another star with an over inflated ego who is prone to removing his shirt

‘Looking at Tadic, he obviously has extremely low body fat. He wasn’t overly bulky but had quite a lean frame and was very toned and defined.

‘If look you at his abdomen, the muscle around there might be superficial, but beneath that are muscles which give you great core strength and support your upper and lower body. It definitely makes you a better all-round athlete.

‘I look at some players and think they will always fall short of how good they could be because they don’t look after their body and don’t have the dedication of these guys.’

Ronaldo’s explosion from the skinny teenager at Manchester United to the ripped superstar of Real Madrid has been well documented — it is said he does more than 1,000 sit-ups each day.

And Leather admits no player is born with a six-pack. ‘That is not naturally given,’ he said. ‘You have to spend a lot of time on your own to achieve that. Whether you’re winning or losing, playing well or poorly, these players will have a strict programme that they stick to.

‘That will include daily work in the gym but also their diet, which will be centred around protein and rebuilding the muscle they break down during exercise.

‘They will probably never stray from that and alcohol and takeaways will be off-limits. Saying that, I personally don’t think there’s too much wrong with the odd Chinese or Indian meal in moderation.’

But not every top footballer boasts a beach bod. Leather points to Barcelona’s Lionel Messi. ‘Look at Messi — his body is very slight and he’s all about a low centre of gravity,’ he said. ‘Building his upper body might take away from what his game is about.

‘There are some players who actually put on too much muscle and it’s about getting what is best for you in terms of the position you play and strengths as a player.’

One advantage for Andy Murray of training in blistering Melbourne heat is that it gives him the chance to show off his impressive upper body.

As the shirtless world No 6 stepped up his preparation for the Australian Open, which starts next Monday, he looked unrecognisable from the lanky teenager who first emerged as a major British talent.

Murray ended his seven-year relationship with fitness trainer Jez Green in November, but his physique doesn’t seem to have suffered. The Scot emerged from his notoriously intense period of winter training looking in prime shape to go all-out for his third Grand Slam title in Melbourne.

As well as taking care of his body, Murray has taken steps to ensure his mind is razor-sharp ahead of the year’s first Grand Slam by working with a sports psychologist.

The 27-year-old began his first full season with coach Amelie Mauresmo by winning the Mubadala World Tennis Championship, an exhibition tournament, and racking up three wins in the Hopman Cup.

Now beefed-up Murray has a week left to put the finishing touches to his forehand — and his forearms — before he attempts to muscle his way to the title at Melbourne Park.
