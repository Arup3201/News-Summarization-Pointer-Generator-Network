A woman was brutally stabbed in the 
chest more than a dozen times while shopping with her infant child at a 
Bed, Bath & Beyond store on Thursday evening.

Tyrik Haynes, 19, was charged with attempted murder in the attack in Middletown, New Jersey on Friday and held on $1 million bail. He had previously been charged with torturing a cat.

Haynes allegedly rushed upon Kerri 
Dalton, 29, with no warning as she pushed her son's stroller through the 
store.

Tyrik Haynes was charged with attempted murder, child endangerment, possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose and unlawful possession of a weapon in his first court appearance on Friday

The teenager then allegedly stabbed Dalton repeatedly in the chest, 
puncturing both her lungs. Incredibly, she still managed to dial 911 for help.

Dalton experienced significant blood loss and was airlifted from the Middletown store to Jersey Shore Medical Center where she was stabilized.

She remains in critical condition. Kerri's husband, Roger Dalton, told CBS on Friday: 'She’s holding up, she’s strong, she’s a fighter, she’s my best friend.'

'I want to thank everyone for keeping us in their prayers,' Mr Dalton continued.

'She’s a newborn mother; thank God the baby wasn’t touched,' he added. 'This guy came out of nowhere and I love my wife.'

Meanwhile, in his first court appearance on Friday, Haynes was charged with attempted murder, child endangerment, possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose and unlawful possession of a weapon.

This isn't his first brush with the law. In December, Haynes was charged with animal cruelty for setting a cat on fire on Christmas Eve.

The Monmouth County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals told Asbury Park Press that Haynes was charged with using a lighter and aerosol spray to ignite the box while the animal was inside.

The cat escaped but was later found dead from its injuries. Haynes is due in municipal court for that crime on February 11.

Workers at the Petco on the same strip as the Bed, Bath & Beyond where Kerri Dalton was stabbed told reporters that Haynes often went into the store to stare at the animals.

Clinical psychologist Dr Bart Rossi told CBS that cruelty to animals is often a prelude to violence against humans.

'This is not the result of a couple of bad days or a bad month. This is someone that’s developed personality problems over time,' Rossi said.
