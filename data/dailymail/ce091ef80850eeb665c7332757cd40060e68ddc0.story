Disguise: Colonel Richard Williams, who commanded the operation, is dressed as a Red Corp

Nine Iraqi police officers who said they were tortured by the SAS have been awarded a total of about £800,000 in compensation.

Up to 40 soldiers, including a former SAS commander, are under investigation for alleged brutality.

If found guilty of actual bodily harm or grievous bodily harm, they may be jailed.

The secret payout, which provoked uproar when it emerged last night, was arranged by the Ministry of Defence and the Iraqis’ solicitors.

The claimants accused the SAS of strangling them and beating them with rifles at a police station in Majar al-Kabir, in Iraq’s Maysan province, ten years ago.

MoD police detectives will fly out in the New Year to question the Iraqi officers about their treatment on June 30, 2003, when they were confronted by 20 SAS soldiers armed with automatic rifles and pistols.

The SAS’s top-secret mission – codenamed Operation Jocal – was to hunt down the killers of six Royal Military Policemen.

The ‘Red Caps’, as they are known, had been murdered by a mob at the same police station six days previously.

At the time, British commanders believed that the Iraqi officers were holding back information vital to the capture of the Red Caps’ murderers.

SAS soldiers were sent into the station to persuade them to talk.

As part of their plan, the SAS squad, led by Colonel Richard Williams, disguised themselves as Red Caps.

This tactic was intended to convince the Iraqi officers they were friends of the murdered men and so secure their co-operation.

When the soldiers did not get the answers they needed, they allegedly resorted to violence.

Allegations: Above, how the Mail On Sunday reported the 'torture' of Iraqi police by SAS troops

Treatment: Ahmed Al-Maliki was allegedly beaten with a rifle to his back and legs and strangled

Although Colonel Williams commanded the operation, there is no evidence he was personally involved in the alleged brutality.

The Red Caps’ killers have never been convicted – a trial collapsed in Baghdad in 2010 after witnesses refused to give evidence.

Last year the Iraqis brought legal action against the MoD, claiming compensation for physical and psychological injuries.

Their solicitors, Leigh Day, refused to comment last night, insisting they are bound by a confidentiality agreement with the UK Government.

A former British commander in Iraq, Colonel Richard Kemp, queried whether the MoD had acted properly.

He said: ‘Given the very large number of Iraqis who have exaggerated and made up claims against British Forces, I very much hope that the MoD has made absolutely sure that this payment is justified.’

In the past financial year £10.5 million has been paid to Iraqis who brought allegations of abuse or  illegal detainment by British Forces.

Asked about the probe into Majar al-Kabir, a spokesman for the MoD Police said: ‘No arrests have been made, but detectives will be interviewing the complainants in the early part of 2014. 

‘The MoD Police investigation is wholly independent of the MoD and civil compensation payments are not a matter for police.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
