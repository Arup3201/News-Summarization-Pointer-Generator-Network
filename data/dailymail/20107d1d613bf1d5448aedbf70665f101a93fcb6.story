She plays the piano and violin beautifully and has already composed an opera, all at the age of seven.

So it's no wonder that classical music lovers are comparing Alma Deutscher with Mozart.

The Surrey schoolgirl has her own YouTube channel to show her ability, and she can even count actor Stephen Fry among her growing number of admirers.

Gifted: Young musician Alma Deutscher, pictured playing the violin at the age of six, has been compared to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart

Natural: Alma Deutscher's playing has gone from strength to strength since she was given her first violin for her third birthday

Fry has posted a link to one of Alma's videos on Twitter, with the accompanying comment: 'Simply mind-blowing: Alma Deutscher playing her own compositions. A new Mozart?'

Alma lives near Dorking with her parents Guy, 43, a linguist and amateur flautist, and Janie, 39, an academic.

Her father has revealed that she could name the notes on a piano by the age of two, and she received her first violin for her third birthday.

Within a year, she was playing Handel. Her videos prove that she has gone on to master works by composers including Schubert, Haydn and Mozart himself.

Arguably most impressive is the footage showing Alma playing her own work, which she has written for piano and violin.

Enchanted: Actor Stephen Fry is among Alma Deutscher's growing number of admirers

The home-schooled seven-year-old now has weekly piano and violin lessons at the Yehudi Menuhin School in Cobham, Surrey, but may become a full-time pupil.

The YouTube channel has attracted more than 75,000 views and has more than 250 subscribers.

Earlier this year, Alma composed a short opera called The Sweeper of Dreams, which she entered into a competition run by the English National Opera to find young classical musicians.

The composition narrowly missed out on making the final.

'I want people to know how I play,' Alda told the Independent, adding that when she is older she wants to 'compose like Mozart, play the violin like Perlman and play the piano like Barenboim'.

Her father said: 'What she is doing now is definitely no less sophisticated than what Mozart was doing at her age.

'What that says about the future, only the future will tell.'

Mozart was composing pieces by the age of five, which he played to his father Leopold who wrote them down.

He went on to compose more than 600 works. He died in 1791, aged 35.
