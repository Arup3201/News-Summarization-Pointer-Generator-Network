It can be a dangerous sport at the best of times, so spare a thought for these professional climbers who posed completely naked in a variety of perilous positions for a calendar photoshoot.

These striking images show the women posing without any equipment in some of the most sensational landscapes across the United States and the world.

Adventure photographer Dean Fidelman, from San Fernando Valley, California, travelled to Colorado, Spain, Argentina, Thailand and other exotic locations to complete the 'Stone Nudes' calendar.

Perilous: This woman expertly clings on to a rock completely naked with no climbing equipment. The professional climber was posing for a calendar, Stone Nudes, put together annually by Dean Fidelman

Mr Fidelman would get the women to climb clothed to begin with to work out the best pose positions

In one image, a climber appears to be hanging perilously from a large rock in the desert, while in another a woman carefully makes her way up an almost totally flat boulder surface.

‘Each year I shoot new pictures and specifically go after these trips. I start around February and work until end of June to make the calendar,’ he said.

‘All of the girls are professional climbers - mostly I use two degrees of separation on everything.

‘I know a lot of guy climbers who know girls who are happy to climb naked so they put me in touch with the right people.’

The series of images were taken throughout 2013 by adventure photographer Mr Fidelman

Mr Fidelman explained that usually the women will climb the rocks clothed before the photographs are taken so he can work out the best positions for them to pose in.

He added: ‘I have always worked in black and white - it has always been my medium...

‘Working in black and white sticks with the fine art medium I work in.’

The 12 nude photographs in Mr Fidelman's calendar always appear in black and white
