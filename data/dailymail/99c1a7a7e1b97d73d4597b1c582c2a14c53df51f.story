Roy Keane has warned Phil Jones he needs to toughen up if he wants to make it as a Manchester United player.

Jones was touted as the new  Duncan Edwards when he signed in a £16.5million deal from Blackburn Rovers in 2011.

But Keane claims the defender has spent too much time injured and, like team-mate Chris Smalling, who signed from Fulham for £10m a year earlier, has gone backwards in his  development. Keane said: ‘We were told Jones was going to be the new Duncan Edwards - Smalling was going to be this and that.

Unconvinced: Keane says the United duo need to do better if they want to cement a place at Old Trafford

‘I’ve 
watched United live nine or 10 times this year and they have been none 
of those things. If anything I think they have gone backwards.

‘You
 say you have to give players a chance to mature, but also you’ve got 
players who you say, “We’ve given you a chance and you’re not taking 
it”. They need to do a lot better if they want to cement their place at 
United.

‘Jones needs to toughen up. Every time I see him he is getting carried off.’

Roy
 Hodgson has picked both players in his England World Cup squad but they
 are likely to be in only as back-up to Gary Cahill and Phil Jagielka in
 the centre of defence. Asked if they were good enough to cover at 
centre back, Keane added: ‘Not on their current form. The two of them 
have had  disappointing seasons.

‘But
 England might need them, you may get players who get injured. Maybe in 
other positions they might be needed. Maybe that is one of the reasons 
why Roy has taken Jones and Smalling, with the thinking that they can 
play full back or midfield.’

Been there and done it: Keane spent 12 years at Old Trafford and made over 300 appearances for United

There
 could be more pressure on the pair to perform for United after this 
summer’s tournament now that Nemanja Vidic has left for Inter Milan and 
Rio Ferdinand is not having his contract renewed.

Ferdinand
 was disappointed that he was informed of the decision by chief 
executive Ed Woodward straight after their final game of the season 
against Southampton, but Keane said he shouldn’t be surprised.

He said: ‘If United are interested in keeping players or doing deals, they would have done it months ago.

‘It
 is no shock to hear that he is leaving. It happens when you get to 35, 
that’s the other side of football. I don’t think Rio will be short of 
offers.’

Meanwhile,
 Michael Owen has called on Jones, Smalling and the rest of England’s 
young lions to be fearless in their quest for World Cup glory this 
summer.

Former
 England striker Owen earned international recognition as a precocious 
18-year-old during the World Cup in France in 1998. The likes of Raheem
 Sterling, Ross Barkley and Luke Shaw could make a similar impact this 
summer.

And
 Owen said: ‘The advantage for the young players is that they will be 
fearless. When you go to a World Cup and you’re young you have no scars.
 You have only been used to success in youth football. Players like 
myself who hadn’t got used to any form of failure, it can be the biggest
 trump card you can play.

‘They are all good players, now it’s all about what’s between your ears.

‘Are
 you tough enough, brave enough, courageous enough to get the ball when 
you’re not playing well? There’s 90,000 people, it’s boiling hot and you
 just want to curl up and die because you’re knackered - and you’re 
still taking the ball.

‘That’s bravery that no one else sees apart from your mate on the pitch.

‘It’s now about who has got the confidence and the arrogance to go out and take the World Cup by storm.’
