Celebrity psychic Sylvia Browne has finally broken her silence following the discovery of Amanda Berry - the missing girl whose mother Browne informed was dead.

Browne told Miss Berry's mother, 
Louwanna Miller, on a 2004 episode of the Montel Williams show that 
Amanda, who went missing the year before, was no longer alive.

Following the psychic's words, Ms Miller walked away being '98 per cent' sure that her daughter was dead. She died of heart failure two years later.

The self-described medium broke her silence on her website
today: 'For more than 50 years as a spiritual psychic and guide, when 
called upon to either help authorities with missing person cases or to 
help families with questions about their loved ones, I have been more 
right than wrong.

'If ever there was a time to be 
grateful and relieved for being mistaken, this is that time. Only God is
right all the time.

'My heart goes out to Amanda Berry, her family, the 
other victims and their families. I wish you a peaceful recovery.'

Amanda's cousin Sherry Cole had supposedly reached out to Browne, according to the psychic's website. Ms Cole said: 'Our family in no way blames Sylvia. This doesn't change anything. We still love her and believe in her.'

Nearly a decade before Amanda Berry 
was found alive in the home of her alleged abductor Ariel Castro, the 
young woman's mother went on The Montel Williams Show looking for 
answers from Browne.

'She's not alive, honey,' Browne told Miller on the show, according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer newspaper. 'Your daughter's not the kind who wouldn't call.'

Browne added that she would only see her daughter 'in heaven, on the other side.'

Amanda
Berry, now 26, escaped from the basement of a Cleveland home on May 6 
with Gina DeJesus, 23, and Michele Knight, 32, who all disappeared from 
the same block ten years ago.

They
were found with a six-year-old girl, who relatives confirmed Amanda 
gave birth to while held against her will at the home for a decade.

Amanda went missing on April 21, 
2003, on the eve of her 17th birthday shortly after she called her 
sister to say that she was getting a ride home from her job at Burger 
King.

On Monday night, Amanda had a smile 
on her face as she hugged her weeping sister Beth as the pair were 
reunited for the first time in a decade following her decade in 
captivity in the home of Ariel Castro.

The kidnapping victim also introduced her sister to her daughter, who was born during the 10-year ordeal.

After 19 months of refusing to accept that her daughter was dead, Ms Miller was finally forced to face what she believed at the time to be the awful truth.

The grieving mother gave away her daughter's computer and took down her pictures.

'I'm not even buying my baby a Christmas present this year,' she told the paper.

Miller
was devastated by what she heard on the nationally syndicated talk 
show, but said that she believed '98 per cent' in Browne.

The
mother said after her on-screen conversation with Sylvia Browne that 
while she wanted to hold on to hope that Amanda was still alive, after a
year-and-a-half without any breaks in the investigation, she had little
to go on.

'It seems like the God-honest truth. My daughter would always call home,' Miller said.

The
FBI and police working on the missing person case were skeptical of the
psychic's verdict, saying they will consider Amanda Berry was alive 
until her body and evidence proving that she was dead is found.

House of horrors: Amanda Berry was freed along with two other women from this home in Cleveland, Ohio, where the three had been held captive for 10 years

Louwanna Miller died at age 44 from a heart failure and a host of other ailments a little more than a year after her 2004 encounter with Sylvia Browne.

Miller had spent three years searching for her daughter, during which time those who knew her said the woman’s health had deteriorated.

Amanda Berry was discovered alive after she managed to escape from the Cleveland home of a man she said had kept her in captivity for the past 10 years along with two other young women.      

Those who knew Mrs Miller, among them Councilwoman Dona Brady, said that the devastated mother died of a broken heart. 

Furious Twitter and Facebook users 
heaped insults on Browne following the discover Miss Berry was alive, 
calling her a 'grief vampire' and a' hunch-backed harpy,' among other 
things. 

'I remember 
you on Montel Williams telling the family of Amanda Berry she was dead,"
wrote Facebook commenter Lisa Lupas on Browne's Facebook page.

'What do you have to say for yourself? You are a fraud! What a horrible horrible thing to say to a family holding on to nothing but hope and faith. Shame on you!'

Another commenter Michael Martin wrote: 'Hey Sylvia, Amanda Berry is alive. Think of the torment you put her mother through when you told the poor woman her daughter was dead.

'Then the mother herself died before she could learn the truth. You are evil, evil, evil and ought to be ashamed of yourself.'

This is not the first time that Browne, who also has helped the FBI in the past, faced public scrutiny over her predictions. In 2003, the TV psychic incorrectly told the parents of missing 11-year-old boy Shawn Hornebeck that their son was dead, and that his body could be found near 'two jagged boulders,' ABC News reported.

Nearly four years later, Shawn was found living with his kidnapper Michael Devlin 60 miles from his home in Missouri.

A website was created in 2006 called Stop Sylvia Browne dedicated to documenting the psychic's purported failures.
