Elle Macpherson made the seamless transition from supermodel to entrepreneur when she launched her eponymous intimates label 25 years ago. 

But after decades in the game, the 51-year-old's line will be 're-branded' as Heidi Klum Intimates.

In a shock departure, The Body's former catwalk and Sports Illustrated rival, who is nine years her junior, will take over as the creative director and face of Bendon's flagship collection.

Bye, bye! It's been reported that the company expects to grow immediately by at least $25 million

Bendon CEO, Justin Davis-Rice said fresh designs and active publicity were important in growing the company: 'Elle has been a great partner to Bendon, however it’s time to take the brand to even greater heights, and Heidi is perfectly positioned to do just that.' 

According to Women's Wear Daily, Elle's three lines for Bendon - Macpherson Men, The Body and the intimates range - are estimated to be worth $150 million and turn over approximately $750 million annually.

Davis-Rice told the publication he expects the brand to grow immediately by at least $25 million, with  Klum's new appointment helping increase retail orders by 25 per cent.

In a statement given to Daily Mail Australia the German beauty said her new role with the company is 'incredibly exciting.'

'In addition to spending a majority of my career modeling lingerie, I am also a woman whose body has changed over the years,' she said. 

'I am a mother of four children so I genuinely understand the importance of finding the right lingerie! I want women everywhere to feel sexy, empowered and confident in my collection every time they wear it.'

The split means that Elle will keep the naming rights to her three underwear labels, but Bendon has ownership of the designs, meaning she can choose to continue the longevity of her famous brand away from partner.

Heidi Klum intimates will roll out in Australian and New Zealand stockists from January 1, 2015.

Unlike Elle's, Heidi will sell her line in the US and Europe. 

According to BRW, in 2013 the Cronulla-born bombshell had an estimated net-worth of $65 million.
