Tragic: Newlywed Ruby Lewis was found face down in the water on the second day of her honeymoon

A newly-married bride found in a swimming pool after a drinking binge on her honeymoon died from 'catastrophic brain injuries'.

Ruby Lewis, 34, had been taking a dip in a pool at a private hospital in Crete while her husband Mark was receiving kidney dialysis treatment inside.

However, the former British Airways hostess was found face down after 'gliding in' to the water on the second day of her honeymoon, an inquest heard.

She died 11 days later in hospital without regaining consciousness after being flown back to the UK.

The couple had been in a relationship for around seven years and married in April 2010 in Wetherby, West Yorkshire, the inquest was told.

Mr Lewis also received a kidney transplant around the time of their wedding so they delayed their treatment for four months, jetting out in August 2010 to the luxury five-star Amirandes resort in Crete.

The tragedy happened on the second day of their trip after the couple booked a short stay at a private hospital about 15 minutes away so Mr Lewis, now 38, could get dialysis treatment.

The coroner heard how, while Mr Lewis was seen by doctors, his wife went to a bar and ordered a glass of a wine and a bottle of water.

She then went to the village of Ano Kalessa, where she bought two small bottles of ouzo and some food.

The credit controller, from 
Kidsgrove, Staffordshire, returned to the hospital about three hours 
later and told the receptionist she would be by the pool.

She was found 
20 minutes later face down in the water.

By the time a doctor pulled her from the water, she had stopped breathing and attempts were made to resuscitate her.

Two bottles of ouzo were found next to her sun lounger.

Mrs Lewis was taken to a hospital in Crete’s main city Heraklion, where doctors sedated her and placed her on a ventilator.

She was flown back to the UK on September 7 and died at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire after her husband agreed to switch off her life support machine when she was declared 'brain dead'.

In a statement read out to the inquest, the doctor who tried to save her said he believed she had 'glided' into the water and said she had suffered a 'catastrophic brain injury'.

A post-mortem gave her cause of death as an 'acute global cerebral infarction' due to asphyxia and water immersion.

There were no signs of external injury.

Blood tests taken by Greek authorities revealed that Ruby had a 'very high' level of alcohol in her blood at the time of the incident.

The hearing was told Ruby who graduated in English Literature at Staffordshire University was a BA air stewardess for six years but changed career after the 9/11 terror attacks.

She went to Korea to teach for a year but suffered a head injury and started to suffer from epilepsy as a result.

North Staffordshire deputy coroner Anthony Curzon recorded a verdict of accidental death.

In a statement at the time of the tragedy, the dead woman's younger sister said: 'The whole family is devastated.

'Ruby and Mark had just got married and settled down. They were happy newlyweds and this was supposed to be one of their happiest times together - their honeymoon.

'They didn’t go straight after the wedding because they wanted to save up for it, stay in a five-star resort and do it properly. We’re just in shock.'
