A Florida woman whose life was turned upside down when her ex-boyfriend posted naked pictures of her to a revenge porn website is picking up the pieces after the embarrassing ordeal.

Holly Jacobs, who has changed her named from Holli Thometz, says her former boyfriend Ryan Seay distributed private intimate photos she had shared with him on the internet in 2009 after they broke up.

Now she is on a crusade to help other women who have been victimized in cyber stalking schemes and trying to move forward with her life.

Hopeful future: Holly Jacobs is putting on a brave face and trying to move forward after her ex allegedly distributed naked pictures of her in 2009 after they broke up

The horrifying ordeal began in January 
2009, when a friend called Jacobs told her that naked pictures of her
 had surfaced on the web.

The woman spent months in a state of constant fear, Googling herself constantly to try and get the photos taken down.

After two years, she became fed up and is speaking out in hope that it can help other women.

'I'm coming out because I'm tired of hiding,' Ms. Jacobs told the New York Observer's BetaBeat blog.

'I hope that I'll set an example and show this is how you overcome this: by coming forward,' she said.

'You're not exposing yourself–you’re already exposed on the internet. Instead, you’re exposing what is happening to you.

'Everybody’s going to see me naked, and everybody’s going to see me do things I never wanted anybody to see except the person I was with. But if it’s in the name of the cause and to change the laws about this, then I’m happy to do it. We’re all naked underneath our clothes.'

Activist: Now Holly is offering comfort to women who have similarly been the victims of cyberstalking

She has accused Mr Seay with distributing the pictures without her permission, saying he was the only person who had access to the photographs, but he has denied the claim.

For several months she Googled her name on a constant basis, fervently trying to get website to take down the pictures.

But the person behind the cruel joke actively tried to keep the pictures alive on the web.

Then the mastermind behind the sex pictures emailed copies of the photographs to her boss and coworker at the Florida International University, where she was working as a Teaching Assistant.

Though she called the police, authorities told her that they couldn't intervene because she wasn't a minor.

New phase: Holly says she spent two years trying to scrub her embarrassing internet footprint until she decided to put the ordeal behind her and move on

She also sought help from the state's attorney's office but they initially failed to pick up her case.

After months and months trying to fight to erase the embarrassing experience in 2012 she decided that she was fed up with the entire episode.

'He wants me to spend all of my time taking down my Google results instead of moving on with my life and being free and being in a good relationship and getting my Ph.D.,' she told the BetaBeat blog.

'I felt like the only thing I could do was part from that identity that had been completely defamed and I wanted to just get on with my life,' she added.

She has created an online effort, End Revenge Porn, to lobby for state measures to punish those who post images to revenge porn websites.

She also formed a support group for women similarly victimized.

The Florida State's Attorneys office has now decided to take on her case and she is optimistic about her future.

Mr Seay faces numerous charges including one count stalking, two counts harassment by use of personal identification info and one count unlawful publication.

His attorney claims that he is also a victim and he has denied the allegations.
