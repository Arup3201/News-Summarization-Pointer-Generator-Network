These remarkable pictures show two daredevil cavers descending 162 foot into a black abyss.

Fearless Aaron Davis appears in silhouette against the sunny woodland above, his limbs outstretched as he appears to free-fall into the gloomy cavern curving out beneath him.

The brave US climber is in fact suspended by a rope as he abseils at speed down into the beautifully named Neversink Cave in Jackson County, Alabama, joined by climbing partner Brian Stoltz.

Terrifying descent: Brian Stoltz prepares to take the plunge into Neversink Cave, a 162-foot deep open-air vertical abyss

Sheer drop: Aaron Davis drops into the incredible cave, which bells out from 40ft in diameter to 100ft at its base, with a cool breeze blowing into it

Their plunge into the watery, open-air 
pit was documented by amateur photographer and research scientist Amy 
Hinkle, using a simple $100 (£60) automatic camera.

'I have built up my cave photography on the idea that one does not need
lots of fancy gear to get a shot,' said the 25-year-old.

'It's about the photographer skill and understanding, not about having thousands of dollars worth of gear.'

The
pit, owned by Southeastern Cave Conservancy (SCCi), is one of the most visited 
of its kind because of its beautiful fern-covered ledges, rare and 
endangered plantlife, waterfalls, and other features.

Ms Hinkle added: 'Neversink is a beauty, I've never seen an open-air pit quite like it.

Great depths: Mr Stoltz comes to a stop at the base of Neversink, which was bought using the donations of cavers after a fundraising drive called 'Buy a piece of the pit'

'Once you get up to a bit of a flat 
level on the mountain, all of a sudden there is this huge 40-foot wide 
in diameter pit with waterfalls cascading into it and lush greenery with
a cool breeze blowing out. It's gorgeous. It is literally 
breathtaking.'

The cave bells out to 100ft in diameter at the bottom.

In 1995, the SCCi launched a major fundraising programme for the Neversink Purchase called 'Buy a Piece of the Pit'.

Cavers were encouraged to contribute to the fund in return for a 
Neversink T-Shirt and an honorary certificate of ownership. The programme 
was a huge success and meant the debt from the purchase was cleared in 
one year.

Miss Hinkle followed Mr Davis and Mr Stoltz's progress at a slower pace, explaining: 'I abseiled slowly down the pit so I could enjoy the view. There are multiple levels of fern-covered ledges of brilliant green against the dark limestone rock.

'I spent about an hour at the bottom, finding snakes and frogs and salamanders slithering about.'

Falling sunlight: Brilliant rays and a waterfall pour into the deep cavern, which is filled with rare and endangered ferns

All angles: Talented photographer Amy Hinkle lowered herself into the pitch-black hole at a slower pace as she captured the breathtaking pictures

Fantastic scenery: The fearless pair rest on a ledge at the start of their journey deep into the earth
