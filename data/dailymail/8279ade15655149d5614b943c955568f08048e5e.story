Google will appeal to the High Court to block a breach of privacy legal action launched against it in the UK by a group of British internet users.

The internet giant's lawyers are seeking a declaration that the court has no jurisdiction to try their claims - which relate to the Apple Safari internet browser.

The British group, known as Safari Users Against Google’s Secret Tracking, accuse the company of bypassing security settings in order to track their online browsing and to target them with personalised advertisements.

The group includes editor and publisher Judith Vidal-Hall, with Robert Hann and Marc Bradshaw, who are both IT security company directors.

They say Google’s 'clandestine' tracking and collation of internet usage between summer 2011 and spring 2012 has led to distress and embarrassment among UK users.

They argue Google’s bid to block a trial is 'misconceived' and the company should 'answer to British justice.'

Allegations against the company include misuse of private information, breach of confidence and of the 1998 Data Protection Act.

The users action group says the information was collected and sold to advertisers who used its DoubleClick advertising service.

Google, the most dominant internet search engine site in the world, is powered from a site in Silicon Valley, California.

The company is multinational and therefore argues that the privacy claim should not be heard in a British courtroom.

It is the latest controversy involving Eric Schmidt's £170bn company after tax avoidance scandals

Antony White QC, appearing for Google, today argued the British claimants had failed to establish that their claims fell within one or more of the legal “gateways” which would allow them to go ahead.

Mr White told Mr Justice Tugendhat that the only potential gateway available required there to be a real basis for concluding that the conduct complained of between summer 2011-spring 2012 would be 'continued or repeated'.

He said: 'There is no suggestion there is any risk of repetition or continuation of that conduct - and good reason to think that it will not be repeated or continued'.

In written arguments before the judge, Google Inc, contends any damages recovered if the claimants win are likely to be 'very modest'.

A trial would be likely to last six to seven days and cost in the region of £1.2m and be disproportionately expensive, it said.

A trial was likely to be 'substantial and complex' and involve a great deal of highly technical evidence about the operation of browsers, websites and cookies, it added.

Campaigner Ms Vidal-Hall said before the court hearing, expected to last two days: 'Google is very much here in the UK. It has a UK specific site. It has staff here.

'It sells adverts here. It makes money here. It is ludicrous for it to claim that, despite all of this very commercial activity, it won’t answer to our courts.

'If consumers are based in the UK and English laws are abused, the perpetrator must be held to account here, not in a jurisdiction that might suit them better.

'Google’s preference that British consumers should travel all the way to California to seek redress for its wrongdoings is arrogant, immoral and a disgrace. We will fight this attempt to dismiss the case robustly.'

Hugh Tomlinson QC, appearing for Safari users, said he rejected Google’s criticism that the claims being brought were uninteresting and made for 'trivial' amounts.

Mr Tomlinson told the judge: 'These claimants are holding Google to account for what they have done.'

He said no regulatory authority had taken action against Google in the UK, though there had been action in the US.

One of two US investigations related to the very breaches underlying the basis for the UK court action.

The Safari users wanted 'to find out what information has been obtained (by Google) and how it has been used', said Mr Tomlinson.

Privacy: Claimants say the web giant has tracked their phones or laptops without permission

'We say there are very serious and important issues which relate to how Google, a corporation of immense wealth and power, deals with private information and the individuals who use their services.

'We wholly reject the idea these are trivial and uninteresting claims sounding in trivial sums and the court should not entertain them.'

The attempt to bypass British privacy rules will further fuel controversy over how Google tries to avoid regulation in overseas markets.

Google avoids hundreds of millions of pounds in corporation tax by legally booking UK profits through its international headquarters in Dublin - claiming profits from sales of online advertising for UK companies should not be taxed here as its intellectual property is in Ireland and the US.

But Dan Tench, a partner with Olswang, which is representing dozens of claimants in the lawsuit, has previously said: ‘Google has a substantial presence here and earns substantial revenues here.

‘This is yet another instance of Google being here when it suits them and not being here when it doesn’t.’ The claimants argue Google’s policies ‘don’t respect’ British privacy laws.

The lawsuit follows on from Google being hit with a record £14.4m fine in America after the company bypassed the privacy settings found on iPads, iPhones and Macs. It also paid out a further £10million to resolve a related complaint.

The privacy breach concerns Apple’s search browser, called Safari, which is designed to block the software that allows Google to track users’ online.

However, Google disabled this safeguard between summer 2011 and spring 2012 without notifying those using it.

Earlier this year, a British judge granted permission for the case to go ahead.

In its submission to the High Court, Google’s lawyers argued that any information gleaned from the search engine is not ‘private or confidential’, meaning it has no obligation to keep it confidential.

Other internet giants, such as Facebook, Yahoo and Microsoft, all offer some services through European bases - meaning there is some protection for users under EU privacy laws.
