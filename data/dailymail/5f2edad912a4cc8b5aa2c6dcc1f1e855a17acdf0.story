Samantha Charlton, with husband Michael on their wedding day

A wife has spoken of the terrifying moment she woke up to find her husband kneeling over her trying to strangle her with a purple silk scarf but she is thought to be staying with him.

Samantha Charlton, 40, was in bed asleep when her husband Michael returned to their home in Sunderland drunk after attending a funeral.

But she woke up to find him on her chest, staring straight at her with a scarf, which had been a present from his mother, wrapped around her throat.

He then told her, 'I'm sorry, I need to get rid of you.'

She only brought the attack at their Sunderland home to an end using 'all the strength she could muster' to push him away.

Charlton, 43, was jailed for two years and eight months for making threats to kill and assault at Newcastle Crown Court.

But it is thought she is standing by his side, as the couple celebrate their 10th anniversary, and she didn't want him to go to prison.

This is despite her husband previously admitting making threats to kill, affray, criminal damage, dangerous driving and harassment in 2001 against his ex-wife, who left him for another woman.

In this latest case, Charlton, of Thorney Close in Sunderland, admitted threatening to kill his wife and assault.

After the attack in February Mrs Charlton told police: 'I had good reason to believe I was going to die.

'I think I would be dead if I hadn't managed to push him away.'

She managed to flee the house and run to a nearby friend for help.

When police arrived at the family home, Charlton, was lying on the bed crying and  told officers: 'I've tried to murder my wife I put the scarf around her neck  to do away with her

When police arrived at the family home Charlton
 was lying on the bed crying and told officers "I've tried to murder my 
wife" "I put the scarf around her neck to do away with her.'

Newcastle Crown Court heard the couple had been to a funeral on the day leading up to 
the attack and Mrs Charlton was asleep in bed when her husband returned 
home drunk.

Prosecutor Simon Worthy told the court: 'She woke up to find the defendant in the bedroom.

'She looked up and found the defendant kneeling on her chest, staring into her eyes.

'She described his eyes as looking wide.

'He had a purple coloured scarf, a present from his mother to her, in his hands.

'He had the ends of the scarf around his hands and had a strong grip of it.

"He then wrapped the scarf around her neck and said 'I'm sorry, I have to get rid of you'.

'He was looking straight at her.

'She said she assumed he was going to kill her.'

Robin Patton, defending, said the couple were facing huge financial pressures at the time and Charlton had never properly addressed problems he had in the past.

He also added that Charlton hopes to sort out the problems with his wife so they can stay together as a couple.

Sentencing,
 Judge Simon Hickey told Charlton: 'What aggravates the seriousness of 
this case even further is you threatened to kill another partner in the 
past.'

He
 added: 'The concern of the court is, in reading the reports and looking
 at your record, is whether on some future date, under similar 
pressures, you may again  snap and do something similar or perhaps 
something worse and carry out the threat.'
