It may have only been a simple kiss - but it’s propelling this couple to international stardom.

Now the young lovers pictured kissing on the streets of Vancouver amid the chaos of the Stanley Cup hockey riots are cashing in on their intimate moment by employing celebrity agent Max Markson.

Australian Scott Jones had originally said he did not want the stress of media appointments after images of him kissing Canadian girlfriend Alexandra Thomas during the riots went around the world.

Hands up: The video shows the couple being knocked down by advancing riot police, before Mr Jones protects Miss Thomas from cops

The news of their attempts to cash in came as new amateur video footage surfaced of the moments that led up to their kiss.

It shows the couple being knocked down by advancing riot police, before Mr Jones protects Miss Thomas from cops. Seconds later Getty Images photographer Rich Lam took the famous shot.

The photo, which was snapped as Mr Jones kissed his girlfriend to comfort her after they were knocked down, has created a global exposure for them that could be worth more than $10million.

‘Overseas people know more about that photo than the Stanley Cup,’ Mr Markson said. His PR firm Markson Sparks has been hired by the couple, who are currently on holiday in California.

Mr Jones, 29, is an actor and stand-up comedian, so the photo could give him a chance to make it in the entertainment industry. Before the photo was shot he mostly worked as a barman in Vancouver.

‘I think for Scott it’s a tremendous opportunity for him to springboard his acting and stand-up comedy,’ Mr Markson told the Toronto Star, adding that there is an ‘obvious commercial opportunity’.

opportunity for him to springboard his acting and stand-up comedy. It could set him up for life, if he’s as good as Robin Williams or Bill Cosby'

‘It could set him up for life, if he’s as good as Robin Williams or Bill Cosby.’

Mr Markson has already had conversations with Michael Hill Jeweller about potential endorsements and the couple have appeared on the NBC Today show and British breakfast programme Daybreak.

They are also looking forward to having lunch with former British Prime Minister Tony Blair when he visits Melbourne next month, reported the Toronto Star.

The riots were sparked after Vancouver Canucks lost the Stanley Cup to Boston Bruins last week.
