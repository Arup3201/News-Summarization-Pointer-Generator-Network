He stunned onlookers by turning up to the premiere of his latest movie with a wedding band on his finger and a new wife on his arm.

And now MailOnline can reveal actor Terrence Howard has married Mira Cristine Pak, a 36-year-old restaurant owner from Orange County, California.

The couple hinted at their nuptials by 
both wearing gold bands on their wedding fingers to the premiere of The 
Best Man Holiday in Los Angeles on November 5.

Staff at Mira's restaurant, the Shabu Shabu bar in Santa Ana, this week confirmed the couple had wed - but admitted they had no idea they were even dating until their marriage.

Bride: Mira Pak married actor Terrence Howard - just one month after meeting him

Indeed, it's believed the pair were only going out for a month before they tied the knot.

And one staff member said: 'Mira does what she pleases, we never know when we're going to see her.

'It's all a bit crazy this thing with Terrence. We didn't have a clue that she was even dating him, then we all heard that she'd married him, and now we don't know where she is.'

When asked to comment on actor's marriage, his ex-wife Michelle Ghent - whom he only divorced in May - made it clear she was aware of the union, but told MailOnline: 'I can't say anything about this.'

Terrence and Mira - who has also been known as Miranda - made another outing last week at the  12th annual Unforgettable Gala at The Legendary Park Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles.

Mira, a former New York University student, has dabbled in modelling and posed in a slinky red dress at HIN Hot Import Nights with Model Vanity Magazine in 2012.

On her Google profile, she calls herself an 'aspiring perfectionist', adding: 'Work hard and play hard...I'll sleep when I'm x_x'

And the slender brunette said she will be found wearing 'Jimmy Choos and MBTs', calling herself 'honest and from the heart'.

Michelle
is Butler star Terrence's second ex-wife. He was previously married to Lori 
McCommas for 13 years until 2005. They have three children, Aubrey, 
Heaven, and Hunter and were married twice.

In 2012, Terrence became a grandfather when his daughter Aubrey, now 19, had a child.

His marriage to Michelle ended in acrimony after three years - and last week, it was revealed she has accused the star of not paying his court ordered spousal support, which amounts to more than $100,000, reported RadarOnline.

Court papers also reveal Michelle has accused Terrence of leaving her with a credit card bill for their failed reconciliation attempt in Costa Rica earlier this year.

She claims: 'Since the commencement date of 5/15/12, Terrence Howard has only made sporadic payments to me totaling $18,435 and owes an arrearage sum of $63,303… Terrence Howard owes me $122,221.64 including interest… legal fees to my lawyer, $15,500.'

Michelle also said that Howard’s alleged failure to pay her has ruined her credit score and forced her to move out of her apartment.

'During our recent reconciliation, Terrence Howard frequently made charges on my credit cards as Respondent does not have his own credit cards and promised to reimburse me for his charges,' she alleges.

The pair tried to rekindle their relationship earlier this year with a trip to Costa Rica, and Michelle says Howard still owes her for that holiday.

'At Terrence Howard’s request, I charged our 7/2013 trip to Costa Rica on my credit card. The unreimbursed charges for the Costa Rica trip and prior charges are approx. $18,282.'

The filing also reveals Terrence earned $856,442.77 between May 2012 and June 2013, reports Radar.

Michelle's accusation is just the latest in a bitter saga between the former couple.

She was granted a temporary protection order by a Los Angeles judge in August, preventing Terrence from coming within 100 yards of her after claiming he beat her during their Costa Rica trip in July.

Terrence countered saying he did not 
lay a finger on her and that she had attacked him with a pepper spray, 
striking his adult daughter and another family member as well.

Though
 the pair went their separate ways when divorce papers were finalised in
 May, the two tried to rekindle their relationship as they travelled 
together to the Central American country with Terrence's family.

The
 termination of their relationship in 2011 was notoriously acrimonious, 
with Michelle accusing her husband of turning violent within months of 
their quiet marriage in 2010.

For
 his part, Terrence had claimed she called him a slew of racist names 
and even threatened to have him killed by Russian gangsters.

In
 the divorce settlement, the father-of-three was able to keep a majority
 of his assets, including his two homes in Pennsylvania.

Michelle was granted $5,800 in spousal support for the next three years, but was forced to return his 2011 Range Rover.

A spokesman for Terrence did not respond when asked to comment.
