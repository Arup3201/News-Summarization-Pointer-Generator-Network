British shops should sell New Zealand
 lamb rather than homegrown meat if they want to help protect the 
environment, experts have claimed.

The suggestion, likely to outrage 
British farmers, comes after a study found the amount of man-made 
greenhouse gases from food production is twice as much as previously 
estimated.

Growing food for sheep, cows and pigs
 takes up far more land and emits more greenhouse gases than producing 
crops for human consumption.

And some methods produce more harmful gases than others, they said.

The study claims Britain, for 
instance, would be better off importing lamb from New Zealand which has 
been produced more efficiently than on its own farms.

Countries can also not only reduce 
emissions but make financial savings by being more careful with regards 
to the way animals are reared.

Costs: Emissions could be reduced and money saved by cutting down meat consumption

National Farmers Union representative
 Nathan Alleyne said: ‘I don’t think we’d be coming out in support of 
that measure, but we’d need to read the report before commenting on it.’

The study shows food production accounts for up to 29 percent of man-made greenhouse gases.

Looking at emissions across the food 
system - including forest clearance, fertiliser production and transport
 - rather than just farming itself - agriculture research organisation 
CGIAR said much more work was needed to cut climate change emissions 
from food.

Their report ‘Climate Change and Food
 Systems’, estimated food production was responsible for a far greater 
percentage than the United Nation’s 14 percent based on a narrower 
definition of farming.

‘From a food point of view (the UN 
approach) doesn’t make sense,’ said Bruce Campbell, who heads the CGIAR 
research programme on climate change, agriculture and food security.

Many countries could make big cost savings by cutting emissions, he said.

‘There are good economic reasons to improve efficiency in agriculture, not just to cut greenhouse gas emissions.’

29 per cent of man-made greenhouse gases come from food production instead of the UN's 14 per cent figure
