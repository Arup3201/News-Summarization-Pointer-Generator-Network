The drummer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers has been sent death threats after he was filmed pretending to wipe his backside on the shirt of Clube de Regatas do Flamengo - the most followed football team in the world.

Chad Smith was forced to make a grovelling apology after the gesture, which has sparked outrage among some of the Rio club's 33 million fanatic followers.

Flamengo, whose famous past players include Zico and Ronaldinho are known for their intense fans, called the 'Nação Rubro-Negra', which means the 'red and black nation'.

They adopted the name because their number of supporters is greater than the population of some small countries.

Not so hot: Smith first goaded Flamengo fans by holding the shirt aloft to cheers from the crowd

Bad idea: The drummer then decided to wipe the shirt on his backside as if it were toilet paper

Smith, who is currently on tour with the
 American band, was at an event for fans in the Hard Rock Café in Belo 
Horizonte the capital of the south eastern state of Minas Gerais, where the local football team are Flamengo's great rivals Curzeiro.

He was conducting a drum clinic when a member of the crowd threw the black and white Flamengo shirt onto the stage to mixed reaction of boos and cheers.

Smith decided to side with the local fans who were jeering and stuffed the jersey down the back of his jeans.

The mood swiftly turns ugly with 
deafening jeers as many react in disbelief to his actions. To make 
matters worse, Smith then throws the t-shirt on to the floor.

Ill-judged: The Chilis member even stuffed the shirt down the back of his jeans

Disregard: The musician's disrespect for the shirt has not gone down well with Flamengo fans

Objects thrown by the crowd narrowly miss his head and people can be heard screaming abuse and shouting ‘shameful’ and ‘apologise’.

After the footage was posted online, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter erupted with death threats and abusive messages.

One
 YouTube post from an Arthur Candeia warned: 'You’ve made enemies of 40 
million fans in one minute...you’ve put your life at risk.'

Remorse: Red Hot Chilli Peppers drummer Chad Smith wears the Flamengo shirt with fans in an bid to win back their support after the incident

Penance: Smith says he will wear the strip for 24 hours to make up for his behaviour. Flamengo has the biggest fan base in the world of over 33 million supporters

Sorry: Smith posted his apology on his Facebook page as well as on the band's official site. He said his joke 'went too far'

Lucas Soares added: 'Will arrive in Rio de Janeiro you will die m***********, f*** you! (sic) Vai vim aqui pro Rio tu vai morrer!!!! (When you come here in Rio you will die!!!)'

Smith received the same level of abuse on Facebook from Flamengo fans, so incensed by his actions they didn’t care that their profiles could easily be identified.

Diogo Xerém threatened to throw a grenade at Smith and warned in slang 'tá fudido'  which means ‘If I get hold of you, you’re ******.’

The Red Hot Chili Peppers are in Brazil for three shows, Belo Horizonte, Sao Paulo and tonight in Rio de Janeiro. 

Just
 hours after the video went up, Smith apologised for provoking fans on 
the band’s official Facebook page and on his Twitter feed.

He said: 'I
 want to apologize for my inappropriate antics at the drum clinic, my 
joke about team rivalries went too far. Flamengo fans...I'm sorry.

Smith’s
 message was accompanied by pictures of him wearing the Flamengo shirt 
signing autographs and posing with the band’s supporters.

He has now promised to wear the red and black strip for 24 hours and has even visited the club today to apologise to the players personally.

He found them relaxing in the Windsor Barra Hotel  in West Rio as they prepared for tonight's game against Goias FC in the world famous Maracana football stadium.

The drummer distributed Red Hot Chilli Pepper T-shirts to the footballers and posed for photos with stars Adriano, Hernane, André Santos and Luiz Antônio.

In
 August 2012, two Flamengo fans were jailed for shooting and stabbing to
 death a supporter from Vasco da Gama football club, a rival team in 
Rio.

Alessandersson 
Piedade Motta,28, and Daniel Abreu Monteiro, 27, killed 29-year-old 
Vasco fan Diego Martins during a brawl between club supporters.

Flamengo's home stadium, Gávea, is rarely used because it is not big enough to accommodate the number of fans the club attracts.

Instead, they play the majority of their games at the government-owned Maracanã, the biggest football stadium in Brazil, with a capacity of 78,838 and will be the location for the 2014 world cup.

The club holds several best attendance records for the Brazilian league.

In 1983 they played against Santos in the Maracanã stadium in a game watched by 155,523 however some say that the official numbers are wrong and that there were more than 160,000 people in the stadium
