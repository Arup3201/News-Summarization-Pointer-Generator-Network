California's drought could last years longer and cost the state $2.2billion, scientists have warned.

They say the devastating drought, one of the worst ever recorded, probably won't finish until the end of next year at the earliest and has already cost 17,100 farm jobs.

The stark warning comes after residents increased their water use this year - despite $500-a-day fines being approved yesterday.

And things could get worse still, as the experts warned the state's groundwater reserves are fast being used up.

Fallout: The conditions make fires more likely and could get worse as groundwater reserves are sucked dry

The study by the University of California, Davis, found the catastrophic three-year drought is responsible for the greatest water 
loss ever seen in California's agriculture.

River levels are being replaced by pumping in groundwater at twice the normal rate in some areas - which could cause a crisis in itself.

Wells in the Tulare Basin north west of Los Angeles are already in danger of running dry soon and many more could follow.

Report author Richard Howitt slammed the state's lack of groundwater checks as a 'slow-moving train wreck', warning reserves underground are being used like an 'unlimited savings account'.

He said: 'The problem is that California is [in a position] almost uniquely in the western states of not measuring our groundwater.

'So
 we're like somebody who's so rich they don't have to balance our 
checkbook. We're walking around signing checks and not even balancing 
the checkbook because we still think we are in a groundwater-rich era.'

California is the only state without a framework for groundwater management, the report said.

The researchers added: 'If the drought continues for two more 
years, groundwater reserves will continue to be used to replace surface 
water losses.

'Pumping ability will slowly decrease, 
while costs and losses will slowly increase due to groundwater 
depletion.'

The report claimed this year alone, drought has cost California's agriculture 3 per cent of its entire value.

This equates to $1.5billion - $1billion in lost income and and $0.5billion in pumping costs.

Once industries that depend on farming are taken into account, this rises to $2.2 billion across the state.

One in 20 of the state's crop fields - 428,000 acres - have been ruined in the worst-hit Central Valley as well as Central Coast and Southern California.

The study added the drought is 'likely to continue through 2015', despite the possible effects of the El Niño weather system.

But the factor hitting people worst on the ground is the loss of jobs.

Around 17,100 have disappeared, 3.8 per cent of all farm unemployment, according to the report.

Mr Howitt, a professor emeritus of farming economics, added: 'These
 are mostly seasonal jobs but they're seasonal and full-time, and 
they're from a sector of the population who have the least ability to 
roll with the punches.'

Ranchers have begun selling their livestock in droves to ranchers in the northwestern states of the U.S.

The report was partly funded by the state's agriculture and water resources departments, and was 
released just hours before state regulators considered rolling out
tighter-still rules on water use.

It used computer models, satellite
data from Nasa and the latest estimates of the State Water 
Project, federal Central Valley Project and local water deliveries and 
groundwater pumping capacities.

'The 2014 drought is responsible for 
the greatest absolute reduction in water availability for California 
agriculture ever seen,' read the report.

Crisis: California Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency last January

'These results...underscore 
California's heavy reliance on groundwater to cope with droughts. 
Without replenishing groundwater in wet years, water tables fall and 
both reduce regional pumping capacity and increase pumping energy 
costs.'

Democratic Governor Jerry Brown 
declared the state's drought to be an emergency last January.

The state has already put millions towards stricken communities and eased 
protections for endangered fish to allow pumping from the fragile San 
Joaquin-Sacramento River delta.

Despite the moves, some areas are seeing more than half their crops die.

Ranchers have begun selling their livestock in droves to ranchers in the
 northwestern states of the U.S.

Most of the 17,100 lost jobs, including
 seasonal and part-time agriculture work, are in the San Joaquin Valley.

Karen Ross, Secretary of the California Department of Food and Agriculture, said residents had to 'develop an ethic of conservation'.

They must 'embrace recycling of water, capturing stormwater [and] investing in storage, whether its above ground or below ground,' she said.

Jay Lund, director of the university's Center for Watershed Sciences, added: 'All the climate change 
studies that we've done, we don't see catastrophe if we manage it well, 
but we do see inconvenience and we do see costs.'

California produces nearly half of 
U.S.-grown fruits, nuts and vegetables and nearly a quarter of the 
nation’s milk and cream.

Across the nation, consumers regularly buy 
several crops grown almost entirely in California, including tomatoes, 
carrots, broccoli, almonds, walnuts, grapes, olives and figs.

Poignant: The grass has even died in the Presidio National Cemetery, San Francisco. California produces nearly half of U.S.-grown fruits, nuts and vegetables and nearly a quarter of the nation¿s milk and cream.

Shock: Some residents have continued using their sprinklers despite the threat of $500-a-day fines

But despite the devastation, the report said consumer food prices will be largely unaffected.

Higher prices of high-value California crops like nuts, wine grapes and 
dairy foods are driven more by market demand than by the drought, it said.

'California’s agricultural economy overall is doing remarkably well, thanks mostly to groundwater reserves,' said Jay Lund, a co-author of the study and director of the university’s Center for Watershed Sciences.

'But we expect substantial local and regional economic and employment impacts. We need to treat that groundwater well so it will be there for future droughts.'
