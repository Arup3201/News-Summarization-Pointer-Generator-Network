When you are married to the Queen's granddaughter, you might expect the in-laws to treat you with decorum.

But it seems Mike Tindall has to put up with the occasional royal ribbing as well.

Her Majesty cracked a joke about the former England rugby player's battered nose behind his back, one of his former opponents has revealed.

Ex-Irish rugby captain Brian O'Driscoll said that when he met the Queen at a formal dinner at Windsor Castle she told him his face was in 'much better condition' than her grandson-in-law's

Ex-Irish rugby captain Brian O'Driscoll said that when he met the Queen at a formal dinner at Windsor Castle she told him his face was in 'much better condition' than her grandson-in-law's.

Mr Tindall married Princess Anne's daughter Zara Phillips in 2011. The 36-year-old, who was capped 75 times for England, broke his nose eight times during his international playing career.

Mr O'Driscoll, 35, told Radio 4's Today programme: 'Myself and my wife were invited to Windsor Castle for a dinner for the president of Ireland. 

Mr Tindall reportedly first broke his nose aged five when the seatbelt came loose on a dodgem car and he head-butted the steering wheel

The Queen and the president of Ireland were there to meet everyone and greet them into the banquet hall, so I actually ended up being last in the queue and I was introduced as Brian O'Driscoll, ex rugby captain of Ireland.

'And the Queen said 'Oh yes, you're retiring soon.' I was shocked at her knowledge. She obviously had someone whispering in her ear.

'She said, 'You look as if you've come out of it relatively unscathed. Your nose looks in better condition than Mike Tindall's does. And I just thought, how unbelievably sharp of her. And I said to her, 'Yes, thankfully it is.'

Mr Tindall reportedly first broke his nose aged five when the seatbelt came loose on a dodgem car and he head-butted the steering wheel.

He once had two metal plates inserted up his nose to keep it straight, but during his next club game they fell out onto a pitch.

In 2011, he revealed Princess Anne asked him whether he would have further surgery before he married her daughter, but he refused, saying: 'It's part of me'.

When Miss Phillips – who is an Olympic silver medal-winning eventer - became pregnant with their daughter Mia last year, he Tweeted: 'Hopefully he/she won't have my nose.'

Last year the couple sold their five-bedroom home in Cheltenham for £1.27million, having bought it for £800,000 in 2009, making a profit of more nearly £500,000.

They have now moved into a property on Princess Anne's Gatcombe Park estate, where Miss Phillips has stables and trains her horses.
