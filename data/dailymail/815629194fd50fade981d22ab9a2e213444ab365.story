Greater Manchester has a new listed building – a brick shed in a grandmother’s back yard that was once used by ‘mad hatters’.

The outhouse in a terrace street in Denton has been given Grade II listed status by English Heritage, placing it on a par with other local treasures including Manchester’s Central Library and Free Trade Hall.

The shed, bought by pensioner Lillian Robinson and her late husband, Maurice, for a three-figure sum in the 1980s, is believed to be the only known surviving example of a largely intact, two-storey planking shop and bow garret – a workshop used by Denton’s prosperous hatting industry in the 19th century.

Greater Manchester's newest listed building is a brick shed in a grandmother's back yard. It's at 66a Market Street and is believed to be the bow garret of William Turner, a hatter who lived at nearby Hope Cottage on South Street, now Stockport Road

It has been listed by conservation experts after MP Andrew Gwynne and local historians uncovered its history.

Mrs Robinson, 74, a lollipop lady, said: ‘I’ve not been into history before but I am now. It’s quite exciting to know that you’ve got something like that in your back garden when you thought it was just an ordinary shed.

‘I knew nothing of it until Andrew came knocking on my door last year with a historian and asked to have a look. I had to rush off but obviously I trusted him so I gave him the key to my house and told him to lock it when he left. When I returned three hours later from my shift, they were still there.

Pensioner Lilian Robinson was surprised to discover that the shed where she stored her late husband's tools and lawn mower was actually a rare example of a shop where hatters plied their trade

'I had no idea of the shed's history. My late husband Maurice and I only used the shed to put his tools in. He used to joke that he was going to convert it into a granny flat for me one day.

We had already owned the house for around 30 years when we enquired about the shed in the 1980s. We bought it for a couple of hundred quid from a man who lived nearby. There was only a big table in there and it was very dusty and we had no idea of its significance.'

The building at 66a Market Street is believed to be the bow garret of William Turner, a hatter who lived at nearby Hope Cottage on South Street, now Stockport Road.

The bowing process, which involved the cleaning of the fur, would have taken place upstairs where the light was better.

The planking process would have been carried out on the ground floor of the two-storey shed.

It involved fur hoods being stripped from the animal and boiled in a kettle of water before being dried - but the process used an orange-coloured liquid that gave off toxic mercury fumes – triggering the term ‘mad hatter’.

Grandmother Mrs Robinson added: ‘The shed has had its fair share of wear and tear. Two years ago a group of pigeons managed to get in and made a right mess doing their business all over the floor.

‘We had to smash one of the windows just to get them all out and we have boarded it up.

‘Mr Gwynne told me that the alley just next to the shed is where the horse and carriage would park up and make it's deliveries, it really is fantastic to be part of history, I never want to sell it now.’

Historian Margaret Smethurst searched in dusty archives for the documentation showing that lollipop lady Lillian Robinson was the owner of a building that was once at the centre of the hatting industry

Historian Margaret Smethurst said: ‘I’d seen the building and thought that’s what it probably was so I looked for the earliest records I could find and saw a structure on the 1841 Ordinance Survey map near to Hope Cottage.

‘I looked at the census and saw that a journeyman hatter lived there with apprentices and his family, so that indicated it was a working place and allowed me to make the link with the outhouse at Market Street which has all the features of a bow garret.’

'It is the last surviving evidence of a major industry and is incredibly important for our nation’s history’                     Nick Brigland, English Heritage

At its peak, Denton and neighbouring Stockport were the centre of Britain’s hatting industry. By 1840, thousands of felt hats were being produced each week. Denton became known for better quality hats made from beaver and rabbit fur, which would have been processed in Mrs Robinson’s bow garret.

Nick Bridgland, of English Heritage, said: ‘It is the last surviving evidence of a major industry and is incredibly important for our nation’s history.’

Mr Gwynne said: ‘I’m grateful to English Heritage for recognising just how important this small building is.’

In the days before modern machinery eliminated the need for felt hats to be made by hand, an occupational hazard was to be sent mad.

The reason was that hatters were exposed to chronic mercury poisoning because of prolonged

exposure to the mercury vapours caused by the method of felting work.

To get felt for hats animals had to be separated from their pelts and the hatters used an orange-coloured solution containing mercuric nitrate as a smoothing agent to remove the skins and stick them together.

The resulting felt was then shaped into large cones, shrunk in boiling water and dried.Hatters worked in confined areas and as the felt dried it gave off volatile vapours.

Prolonged exposure could cause mental confusion, emotional disturbances, and muscular weakness. Hatters could also suffer nerve and kidney damage as well as red fingers, toes and cheeks and lose their hearing, hair, teeth and nails as well excessive sweating and bleeding from the ears and mouth. They also became shy and irritable.

Eventually, governments stepped in and in 1898, legislation was passed in France to protect hatters from the risks of mercury exposure.

By the turn of the 20th century, mercury poisoning among British hatters had become a rarity.

On July 4, 1862 the Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson and the Reverend Robinson Duckworth took a five-mile boat trip on the Isis in Oxford with three young girls – Lorina, 13, Alice, 10, and Edith, 8 – the daughters of Henry Liddell, the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University and Dean of Christ Church.

On the trip the Reverend Mr Dodgson told them the story of a girl named Alice who was after an adventure. The girls loved it and Alice Liddell asked him to write the story down for her. The story became Alice’s Adventures In Wonderland and the Reverend Mr Dodgson published it under the nom de plume Lewis Carroll.

As well as Alice, the book contained a panoply of marvellous characters including the Mad Hatter (who held a tea party), the Queen of Hearts, White Rabbit, a Gryphon and a Mock Turtle.
