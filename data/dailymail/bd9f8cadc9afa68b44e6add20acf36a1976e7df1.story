Dramatic pictures show the £50,000 mid-terraced property was completely destroyed in the explosion. The two neighbouring properties were also damaged.

This afternoon police dogs were sent in to the wrecked building to search for any signs of life, however no one is believed to have been inside.

Residents evacuated from their homes in the street said a family with children living next door had a lucky escape.

Sara Knox, 35, who lives on the opposite side of the road, told how she rushed to help after the explosion. She said: 'I was woken up by the loud bang, followed by two smaller bangs.

'Billows of smoke and rubble covered the house, so I quickly threw on some clothes and ran outside.

'There was a woman screaming uncontrollably outside and I asked if there was  anybody else in the house, and I was told there was.

'With my gut instinct, I ran into the house and went upstairs to find two young girls looking so scared.

'I made sure they came outside and were safe. I wasn't going to be left  wondering if there was anybody else in the house, I wanted to know myself.

Wrecked: Wood and bricks from the property in Tinsley can be seen in the street this morning following the blast

Ahmed Zafar said: 'It could have been
 a lot worse. I think it was a lucky escape for the family that was 
living next door. The gentleman that was in there and doing the work. I 
think he was hurt and was taken away in the ambulance.'

Mr
 Zafar, who lives opposite the destroyed house said: 'I was just 
sleeping at the time and I heard a big bang go off. I thought it was an 
earthquake or something. I looked out and I saw the house on fire.'

He
 said: 'There was all kinds of kerfuffle going on down in the road. Kids
 crying and stuff. The street’s quite busy. There’s a lot of kids 
around, walking about. I think they got all shocked by it. The 
neighbours - I saw them. They were all shook up. The windows were all 
shattered and they were just coming out.

Burning: Smoke can be seen billowing from the terraced property in Tinsley, Sheffield, in the aftermath of the blast

'Their kids were quite young. They 
have a three-year-old and a five-year-old. I think one of those got hurt
 and got taken away in the ambulance.'

Another evacuated resident, Awais Ali, said: 'At nine o’clock this morning I just heard this big explosion going off.

'I didn’t know what it was. I thought it could have been an earthquake or something. It was that serious.

'By the time I got outside I could see the loft insulation and roof supports lying about.

'A large amount had landed in my garden and that’s six houses away. It was pretty serious.'

Mr Ali said: 'I just went down to see if the next door neighbours are alright because they’re pretty close family friends. They were alright. They made a quick escape.'

Police cordoned off a number of 
surrounding roads following the blast this morning as the emergency 
services worked at the scene.

A spokesman for South Yorkshire Police said: 'Officers at the scene are waiting for the
 area to be made safe to enable them to progress the investigation, but 
initial reports suggest that a gas explosion is the likely cause.

Investigation: Two gas workers arrive at the scene following the explosion in Tinsley, Sheffield, this morning

'One property has been destroyed, and significant damage caused to the 
adjoining properties. Residents have been evacuated, and at this stage 
no serious injuries have been reported.

'One man remains in hospital with suspected minor injuries, including facial burns and cuts. It is believed he was at the house that was destroyed in the explosion.

'A woman and two children from a neighbouring property were taken to hospital as a precaution with suspected smoke inhalation.'

Group manager Ade Robinson, from South 
Yorkshire Fire and Rescue, said: 'The explosion has more or less 
completely destroyed the property.'

He said a specialist team from West 
Yorkshire was making a precautionary check on the property to make sure 
there is no-one else inside.

Mr Robinson said: 'This is a methodical 
approach to ensure the residents’ safety most importantly, firefighters’
 safety and our partners’ safety as well while we’re carrying out the 
search.'

He said: 'The information we have is 
that there’s no-one in that property. But we need to be confident that 
that is the case. Therefore, we need to take these precautions and do a 
thorough search.'
