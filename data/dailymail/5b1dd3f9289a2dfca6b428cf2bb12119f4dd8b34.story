A once obese woman who won a prize to get fit last Christmas is celebrating after shedding eight stone this year.

Jenni McFeat, 31 from Winsford, Cheshire, shed the excess weight after she won six personal training sessions with a top coach in a competition he placed on his website.

The dental practice support manager is now down to a size 10 after tipping the scales last December 25 at 18st when she wore a size 24.

Jenni McFeat has lost an incredible 8st in one year going from 18st and size 24 (left) to just 10st and a size 10 (right) 

Jenni said: 'I entered the competition because in my mind I knew I had to do something about my weight,

'Anthony Foy's post about the competition came up on my news feed on Facebook and I thought: "I could do that" so my sister told me to enter it.

'I'd never won anything in my life and of all the things to win I didn't want to win this! 

She entered a competition to win sessions with personal trainer Anthony Foy (pictured with her recently, right) as she knew her weight was out of control (left, before)

'I was devastated, mainly because I was embarrassed to go in the gym, but this time I had no excuses not to go and try it. I started my training the 3rd of January this year and I'd never been nervous before, but when I went to my first session in the gym I was sweating before I'd even got there.

'Afterwards I thought I was going to collapse and my heart rate was through the roof.

'Once I'd recovered though I thought: "I have to do this. I have two little girls at home that need a healthier mummy."'

Four years ago Jenni's partner cheated on her and she always cited this as the reason for her weight ballooning.

After she got over her fear of the gym, Jenni began working out regularly with Anthony as well as transforming her diet and stopping her comfort eating (left, as she started losing the weight)

Once she started to lose the weight Jenni's two daughters Freya, 7 and Lillie, 5 were her inspiration for continuing to fight the flab.

The three of them used to go camping and Jenni was left humiliated when her girls wanted to play football but knew their mum couldn't join in. 

She said: 'We go camping quite a lot and the girls always want me to run around playing football but I couldn't. They'd say no mummy can't play.

'Now our whole lives have changed I'm happier and healthier and more relaxed and the girls have a mum they can play with.'

Breakfast: A bacon roll and coffee from Greggs

Lunch: Fish and Chips from the local chip shop or a Greggs pasty

Dinner: Massive portion of lasagne

Snacks: Biscuits, chocolates, sweets

Breakfast: Porridge with berries

Lunch: Salad with either turkey or mackerel

Dinner: Steak with sweet potato and vegetables

Snacks: Soft cheese and crispbreads, fruit, mixed nuts, protein shakes

Jenni says her two daughters inspired her to keep going and they all lead a healthier life now

Jenni has also transformed her diet after training with coach Anthony.

Before she used to snack on biscuits and chocolates throughout the day and paid frequent visits to the chip shop for her lunch.

However, now she snacks on fruit and nuts in between meals of turkey salad and porridge and is delighted with her new 10st figure. 

Jenni said: 'It was hard and it kept getting harder and the weights kept getting heavier but the results kept coming and that kept me going.'
