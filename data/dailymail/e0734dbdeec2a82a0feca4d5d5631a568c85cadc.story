The year’s first Grand Slam sees Andy Murray with a new kit, a new personal logo, a slimmed-down support team, pain-free and engaged to be married.

And, as he insisted during a break in preparation for the Australian Open, which starts on Monday, he also feels unencumbered by a surrounding atmosphere he felt may have held him back in 2014.

It was an unusual sight to see him practising without Dani Vallverdu, who — along with trainer Jez Green — departed in the off-season, the former to work with Tomas Berdych.

Murray said he had different ideas on how to progress compared to Green and Vallverdu

They had been through a lot and achieved much together, but it is becoming clear how much their harmony had deteriorated in the wake of Ivan Lendl leaving and being replaced by Amelie Mauresmo.

Murray referred to ‘moving together in one direction’ so often that it sounded like the topic might have been boy bands rather than the split from two of his most trusted lieutenants.

‘When I sat down with Dani and Jez at the end of the year it was clear they had different views on things and what they wanted to do,’ said Murray, who meets a qualifier in the first round. ‘I didn’t really agree with them and that’s why things ended up changing.

‘When you’re actually playing tournaments you’re not discussing every little thing, but when you look back at the year and the last few months I would say the atmosphere within the team wasn’t particularly good.

‘It’s not helpful for anyone when it’s like that and that hadn’t always been the case, we had a very good relationship for most of the time. When things aren’t going well and you look back and the atmosphere hasn’t been good, it affects how everybody works.

‘The atmosphere is good now. When the people around you are pulling in the same direction it’s beneficial and hopefully that will mean some good performances.’

It is clear that, aside from the passage of time — which can fray any good coaching relationship — one of the areas of disagreement involved training methods. 

Murray and Matt Little, the trainer now working full-time with him, have been focusing more on speed and slightly less on the hard yards in the gym.

Murray feels that he is in good shape going into the first major championship of the year

He already feels it is paying a dividend and performances in his first two, albeit unofficial, tournaments of the year have banished the memory of that 6-0, 6-1 loss to Roger Federer at the O2 Arena in November.

‘I have never moved as well at the beginning of a year,’ he said. ‘Coming into the Australian Open last year I did loads of fitness, too much, probably. I trained almost every day for three months and you could say I was very fit but I was tired as well.

‘When I was playing matches I was waking up sore and stiff so I wasn’t necessarily match fit, whereas now I feel in good match shape. My first match of the year was long but I woke up with no issues. I feel strong and balanced. I have been doing a lot more speed work on the court. I have been working a lot on my movement in the off-season — three, four days a week. That isn’t something I have done much of over the last few years.

‘I feel that my speed around the court is a huge strength and something I should work on and try to get better at, because when I move well around the court, even when I am not playing good tennis, I can still find ways to win matches.’

He is also clearly of a mind to prove wrong those who question whether Mauresmo is the right person to restore him to the status of Grand Slam winner.

Andy Murray says he will leave the wedding planning to fiancee Kim Sears. A word of warning — when engaged to Kim Clijsters, former world No 1 Lleyton Hewitt declared: ‘I’ll just rock up. She can organise it.’ 

Nine months later the pair split amid rumours of a dispute over the organising of their big day.

‘You can’t judge how a relationship is working with someone based on a few events, you have to look over an extended period of time,’ he said. ‘In the off- season it has been the first time I have got to spend a good amount of time on the court with her to consistently work on things.’

The sense is that he is excited about his prospects, in contrast to 12 months ago when he was nervous about how his back would hold up following surgery.

There is also the anticipation of his nuptials later this year, although he is leaving much of the arranging to fiancee Kim Sears, saying: ‘I try to stay out of all that. I just agree with Kim on most things. The only thing I will be involved in is the food — that is what I am particularly interested in. The rest is on Kim.’

Yesterday’s draw has kept him in the opposite half to strong favourite Novak Djokovic but there could be a fourth-round meeting with world No 11 Grigor Dimitrov, who knocked him out of the Wimbledon quarter-finals last year. And in the last eight Murray is due to meet Federer, so there is plenty of scope for avenging some of the disappointments of 2014.

James Ward will face world No 33 Fernando Verdasco while Heather Watson, who overnight was attempting to win her second WTA title at the Hobart International, is up against world No 67 Tsvetana Pironkova. 

Britons Kyle Edmund and Liam Broady were involved in the last round of qualifying.
