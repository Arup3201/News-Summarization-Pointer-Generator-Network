They're the toughest Arctic waters in the world -  almost mythical in their ability to frustrate sailors, with extreme icy conditions rendering them largely off limits.

But now a cruise line is offering intrepid travellers the chance to face the Northwest passage - the route through northern coast of North America,  connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.

In 2016, The Crystal Serenity will take 900 passengers on the largest expedition through the Northwest Passage ever made, setting passengers back between £12,500 and £93,000.

British sailor John Franklin left England with two ships in 1845. The expedition never made it; all 129 of the crew perished in the Canadian high Arctic ice.

Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen - who later led the first successful expedition to the South Pole - made history by crossing the Northwest Passage in three years reaching the Pacific in 1906.

In 1942 a second ship replicated Amundsen's achievement, and only in 1944 did anyone do so in the space of a single year, without being forced by the ice to halt midvoyage for the winter. 

By the mid-1990s, only three or four ships made the journey each year.

Four ships made the journey in 2006, by 2013, that had increased to 18.

Silversea's 132-guest Silver Explorer recently  successfully completed the journey through the  Northwest Passage.

The 23-day voyage commenced in 
Kangerlussuaq, Greenland on August 9 and concluded in Nome, Alaska on September 1. It covered a distance of nearly 3,500 nautical miles.

But the route has never been attempted by a ship of this size.

Thomas Mazloum, executive vice president of Crystal Cruises explained: 'A lot of small expedition ships have now gone through the Northwest Passage and even some commercial ships.'

'But we don't have 100 guests on board; we have 800 or 900. To do it with a ship like ours, we need to do it differently.'

The ‘once-in-a-lifetime expeditionary voyage’ is being offered by Crystal Cruises is set to appeal to wildlife lovers and those curious about our changing world.

Departing from the Gulf of Alaska, the 32-day journey will navigate the Northwest Passage, around Alaska and into the Beaufort Sea, through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and on to Greenland, before docking in New York City.

Holidaymakers will get the chance to see amazing arctic wildlife in its natural habitat, such as humpback and beluga whales, seals and walruses, oxen, kittiwakes and murres in flight. 

There will also be the chance to meet indigenous people, living in small Arctic settlements on the route.  The trip is two years in the making and the first cruise will depart on August 16, 2016.  

Arctic sea ice conditions have shifted, making it possible for a wider range of vessels to sail the passage

Only around 200 ships have ever sailed the whole length of the Northwest Passage since Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen (who later became the first man to reach the South pole) made history by crossing it in 1906. Only in 1942 did a second ship manage to replicate his journey.

But more recently, Arctic sea ice conditions have shifted, making it possible for a wider range of vessels to sail the passage. 

It is not without its risks though. In 2010, an expedition ship named the MV Clipper Adventurer ran aground there. The crew and 118 passengers were rescued by a Canadian icebreaker.

The area is served by seven icebreakers, operated by Canada's coast guard, but rescues can be lengthy due to the sheer scale and remoteness of it.

So Crystal Serenity will be prepared for all eventualities, travelling with a support vessel, which can break channels through the ice, a helicopter pad  and facilities for towing and evacuations.

And the cruise liner insists that they will not impact the small arctic towns and fragile environment.  

Thomas Mazloum told CNN: 'We want to do this in a responsible manner and educate people. I understand that some people may not like that, but I think we can have a positive impact.'

'We are not going to leave anything behind. Not a single drop of garbage or anything else.'

Passengers will disembark in small groups of 150 - 200 when visiting Arctic settlements and Mazloum insisted that the local populations were enthusiastic about showcasing their culture to interested visitors.
