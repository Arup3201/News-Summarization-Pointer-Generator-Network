The last thing Sophie Guidolin expected to discover when she was busy raising two young boys, and advocating a healthy lifestyle to hundreds of thousands was that she was pregnant again - with twins.

Six years ago and 28 kilograms heavier than she is now, Sophie saw how her pregnancy with her first two children had affected her body.

The 25-year-old from the Gold Coast then decided to turn her life around with an incredible fitness and diet regime that transformed her into the best shape of her life - and a national bodybuilding champion.

But despite the shock of having twins, Ms Guidolin is determined to maintain her super-fit lifestyle with the same regime she honed using household items such as chairs, stairs and filled water bottles.

Sophie Guidolin is 12 and a half weeks pregnant with twins and aims to stay fit and healthy throughout her pregnancy

'Twins were a huge shock,' Sophie told Daily Mail Australia.

'We had been trying for a while and there are twins in the extended family, but we never even considered it was an option for us.'

But even though she is nearly 13 weeks pregnant, 25-year-old Sophie is dedicated to keeping the weight off in an effort to have a more positive pregnancy than she had in the past.

By previously cutting out processed foods, starting a strict fitness regime and going on to win nationals in body building, Sophie plans to keep her body in tact this time.

'My eating habits are not changing at all, I don't eat processed foods, soft cheeses or drink alcohol anyway so I haven't needed to cut anything out which is great,' she said.

'I'm going to listen to my own body.' 

According to the National Association of Specialist Obstetricians and Gynacologists (NASOG) a diet during pregnancy should be high in fibre and protein while maintaining two litres of healthy liquid a day.

Sophie was informed by her obstetrician that she can keep up any form of exercise as long as she consumes water and keeps her heart rate under 160 beats per minute.

'They told me not to exercise before they assessed me but they soon realised that I am very fit so it's completely fine.'

Sophie is closely documenting her workouts, healthy recipes and lifestyle changes through her social media channels and with 300,000 Facebook likers, her advice is reaching a lot of people.

'Women become scared of miscarrying if they exercise but this is a complete myth with no evidence to back it up,' she said

'I want to avoid having a caesarean as they are common with twins,' she said

After having mostly negative experiences with the pregnancy of her first two children, Sophie is aiming for a tranquil natural delivery with her twins.

'I want to avoid having a caesarean as they are common with twins,' she said.

Sophie's advice to other mothers who are seeking to keep up a strict fitness regime while pregnant is to not be afraid and ignore the myths.

'Women become scared of miscarrying if they exercise but this is a complete myth with no evidence to back it up,' she said.

'It actually does the opposite and assists in the delivery of birth.'
