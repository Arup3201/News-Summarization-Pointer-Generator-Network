A polite sign posted outside a toilet at a shopping centre has raised the question – at what age should children go to public restrooms alone?

The notice, which reads ‘please boys over 6 years of age use men’s restroom’, was taped to the wall of a women’s toilet at an Oklahoma outlet mall, in America.

The Oklahoma City Moms Blog posted the image on Facebook, sparking debate worldwide.

‘If you were shopping at a local mall and saw this picture, what would your reaction be?,’ the photo’s caption read.

The post comes after calls for more gender-neutral family bathrooms where dads and mums can both take their children.

This sign, which reads 'please boys over 6 years of age use men's restroom', was taped to the wall of a women's toilet and went viral after it was posted on Facebook 

Earlier this week Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher raised the issue on his Facebook page when he complained: ‘There are NEVER diaper changing stations in men’s public restrooms.’

The new dad added: ‘The first public men's room that I go into that has one gets a free shout out on my FB page! ‪#‎BeTheChange.’

Parenting expert Jo Ryan from support service Babybliss told Daily Mail Australia the age of when a child should go into a public toilet alone is a ‘tough question’.

‘It depends on the child really,’ she said.

‘I think six is too young. I’m not sure if I’d want them to go in a public toilet on their own,’ Ryan explained.

‘Some boys want to do that at that age, you have to judge the child and whether it is a safe environment. Toilets are always an unknown.

In Australia, many shopping centres have family bathrooms for parents to take their kids 

‘For me, I don‘t think I would let them go in on their own, I would want to take them with me. It’s usually when they are a bit older -around 7 or 8 – that they want to go in alone,’ Ryan said.

‘What if the child has got a disability or a mental age of two or needs assistance?,’ she asked.

Ryan also pointed out that in Australia most public toilets in modern shopping centres have a family room that can be used by mums and dads.

‘I actually took my goddaughter into a family toilet yesterday at Bondi Junction, Westfield, in Sydney, she’s three.

‘I thought “is it only for women?” but the sign says ‘parents’ and there was a man and a women sign, so I would think most men are allowed to go into them,’ Ryan reasoned. 

‘I think in this country in the big shopping centres they do cater for men, we don’t have changing rooms in our public toilets whereas the obviously do in America.

‘We have actual parenting rooms where you can change nappies, there are toys and my goddaughter didn’t want to leave.’

Ryan did note that in some places such as restaurants there are not even any changing facilities.

Sydney dad Mark Elias, whose son Jacob is almost two years old, told Daily Mail Australia he would let his child go to a public bathroom at ‘11 to 12 years’.

‘But it depends on the kid and the maturity level and the place you are at,’ he added. 

'This day and age it's better to cautious.' 

Meanwhile, Claudia Bowman, a mother of three and member of the Kings Cross Parents and Carers Association, in Sydney, said: 'I think it's clear this sign is inappropriate. I can't imagine it complies with any hospitality standards code.'

'Parents I know make decisions based on the needs of their child as an individual. Maturity of a child has nothing to do with their birth age. Some six year old children have the maturity of a four year old,' Ms Bowman explained.

'Part of being a parent is making the best decision for your child's welfare regardless of the pressure and expectations others impose.

'Personally I'll be doing as I see best for each of my three children regardless of this sign,' she added.

At what age would you stop accompanying your child into a public bathroom?
