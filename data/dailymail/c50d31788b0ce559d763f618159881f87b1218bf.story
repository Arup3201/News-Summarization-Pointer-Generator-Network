It is not the first time crime writer RJ Ellory has used fake identities to shape his reputation.

And now the author has been accused of using pseudonyms to try to remove negative stories on his Wikipedia page.

The 47-year-old has been banned from editing on the site after he tried to delete the stories from his biography.

Volunteers for the online encyclopedia became suspicious amid accusations that the integrity of the profile had been compromised.

Officials declared he had breached its 'self promotion' rules and banned him after finding that he had tried to delete stories as well as links to Telegraph.co.uk.

Mr Ellory, whose full name is Roger Jon Ellory, said, as reported by the Daily Telegraph, the coverage of his actions was 'a significant matter of misrepresentation' and that stories had 'blown (it) out of all proportion'.

It comes not long after the author, who wrote A Quiet Belief in Angels and A Simple Act of Violence, was exposed for writing fake glowing reviews about his work online, while simultaneously criticising his rivals.

He admitted using fake identities to write about his work on Amazon, giving himself five-star ratings.

The father-of-one, who won crime 
novel of the year in 2010, appeared to have used at least two fake 
identities to rave about his writing on the site.

Following the revelation he repeatedly apologised to his fans and rivals, saying in a statement that he regretted the 'lapse of judgment'.

In the weeks after he was exposed, 
Ellory took to his Wikipedia page to amend the wording of a 'controversy
 paragraph' and the newspaper links which gave 'completely the wrong 
bias on his issue'.

When challenged he admitted he had written his biography and said he was confused about the policy and questioned why he was not able to delete 'potentially libellous statements' about his work, which he said were 'grossly unfair, unjust and biased'.

He told the Wikipedia moderators, as reported by the Daily Telegraph: 'My intent was merely to see that the information on my page - which is, after all, a representation of me and my life to the wider world, was not biased, inappropriate, incorrect and false.'

In September it was revealed that posting as ‘Jelly Bean' on Amazon, he wrote that his novel A Quiet Belief in Angels was ‘one of the most moving books I’ve ever read'.

He
 continued: ‘It is so beautifully written I felt as though it enabled me
 to be a part of that era even though that can never actually happen.

'I would highly recommend this book to anyone who really wants to experience a class read.’

He also appears to have been posting as ‘Nicodemus Jones’, who described the same novel as a ‘modern masterpiece’.

‘Just buy it, read it, and make up your own mind. Whatever else it might do, it will touch your soul,’ he wrote.

But the same reviewer had fewer kind words for crime novel Dark Blood by Scottish writer Stuart MacBride.

He wrote: ‘This is the second of this author’s books I have read, and, to tell you the truth, I can’t be bothered any more.’

The reviews dated back at least four years.

The Crime Writers’ Association earlier condemned the practice and announced moves to introduce a code of ethics.

Yesterday a spokesman for Wikipedia said the author was banned from the site.
