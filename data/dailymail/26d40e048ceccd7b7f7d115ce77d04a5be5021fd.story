A Pirates of the Caribbean captain who vanished along with his British wife on Saturday was found safe and well last night.

Sailor Arthur Alleyne, 63, who skippered a ship used in the first of the films, had been missing in the huge area of ocean between St Lucia and Barbados.

The yacht he was sailing with wife Sharon had been 'drifting' in the Caribbean sea for almost five days after hitting a storm.

Arthur Alleyne, 63, an experienced sailor of 40 years, and his wife Sharon Went-Alleyne, 59, were last seen on Sunday sailing from St Lucia to Barbados, a trip the couple had done 'possibly hundreds of times'

But they were rescued following a massive search operation organised by their children, who live in the UK.

Daughter Tao Alleyne said: 'They've been found - apart from being hungry and a bit dehydrated they are safe and well.'

Mr Alleyne, also known as Captain Sam, headed celebrity ship The Brig Unicorn, which was used in the filming of all three Pirates Of The Caribbean movies, as well as in the television series Roots.

The 148ft ship was built in Finland in 1948 and played The Henrietta in The Curse Of The Black Pearl, and The Terrasaw in Dead Man's Chest and At World's End, before it went down off the coast of St Vincent and the Grenadines in May this year.

On Saturday, Mr Alleyne had been returning a yacht, called Serenity, to it's owner on Barbados and Mrs Went-Alleyne, 59, went along for the journey to keep him company.

Miss Alleyne had last heard from her mum on Friday before they set sail and she said she was 'calm' and looking forward to the trip.

But she endured an anxious five days when she lost contact with the ship on Saturday afternoon.

Search: Martinique and Barbados sent out search and rescue planes  and St Lucia's Marine Police also joined the search for Mrs Went-Alleyne and her husband

Miss Alleyne said her last contact with the boat was at 2pm on Saturday, but a mysterious voicemail came in to one of the dock's phones at 3.15pm Sunday.

She said: 'In the voicemail, there was the sound of wind whipping and waves crashing, and in the background we could faintly hear the voices of the two people but we couldn't make out what they were saying over the noise.'

She also indicated that a severe storm may have damaged communication equipment on Serenity, 47ft sloop. 

But when her dad was finally found last night the first thing he did was call her to say they were OK.

Mr Alleyne had said she had 'every right to want to kill him for worrying her'.

His daughter added: 'My dad is an excellent captain and is always calm in an emergency.

'He's been a sailor and a captain for the better part of 40 years and he's extremely familiar with the route he was taking, which is why we were all so surprised about what happened.

Tao said that in the voicemail there is the sound of wind and the faint noise of her parents talking, but their voices cannot be heard. Mr Alleyne grew up on the island of St Lucia (pictured)

'But if anyone would be able to salvage the situation and keep them safe it would be him.'

'My dad has been a sailor and a captain for the better part of 40 years and he's extremely familiar with the route he was taking, which is why we're all so surprised at this happening.'

Mr Alleyne is 'Barbados born and bred' while is wife Sharon is originally from Donnington in the UK.

The pair have lived in St Lucia for around 25 years.

Miss Alleyne, a mother of one, said: 'My father didn't speak much about his time with Pirates of the Caribbean.

'I think perhaps it was part of his contract, for the celebrities' protection.

'My father as well as several members of the crew gained a few seconds on screen in the first movie, but you have to know who you're looking for.'
