Introducing Dave Brat, the complete unknown who shocked Democrats and Republicans alike who won a decisive victory against GOP heavyweight Eric Cantor in Virginia's 7th Congressional District on Tuesday.

The 49-year-old husband and father of two ran on a staunchly conservative immigration platform and used his credentials as a free market-loving college professor of economics to clench the nomination.

To learn more about the dark horse candidate, one need do no more than read the ratings left by his students on teacher review site RateMyProfessors.com.

'He's so charming': David Brat came out of virtually nowhere to win the GOP primary against the No. 2 most powerful House leader Eric Cantor on Tuesday. The 49-year-old professor clearly has fans in Virginia's 7th Congressional District, but his students who call him a 'charming...hottie' like him a lot, too

Family man: Brat is a married father of two. His wife's name is Laura (in yellow beside conservative talk radio host Laura Ingraham

'He's so charming and really knows how to incorporate real world examples to keep the class exciting and relateable,' wrote one enamored student. 'Plus he's total eye candy!!'

The underfunded political novice is a professor at Randolph-Macon College.

Brat accused Cantor of embracing 'amnesty' and open borders, signed an anti-immigration pledge, and got assists in recent weeks from conservative figures popular with tea party voters such as radio host Laura Ingraham and columnist Ann Coulter, who labeled Cantor 'amnesty-addled.'

'He really just didn’t have very much money, but what he did have was a lot of heart,' Ingraham told The New York Times. 'I think there will be a lot of people out there saying this could be the beginning of something really big for the Republican Party.'

Brat's students appreciate how he looks in a cardigan more
than his approach to teaching and politics.

'I'm just running on the founding principles (of) Adam Smith': Brat, right, cruised to victory Tuesday by playing to the right of conservative Republican Eric Cantor

'Plus he's total eye candy!': Brat's students gave him a hotness rating of glowing red chili pepper on RateMyProfessors.com

His hotness rating on the site is a glowing red chili pepper
- just a notch down from the site's best rating of burning chili pepper.

Another rater wrote: 'Brat changes assignments all the time, but he is so charming, you forget to be mad at him'.

Brat grew up in the Michigan before moving to Henrico, Virginia in 1996 to teach economics and ethics at Randolph-Macon College, a small liberal arts school in Ashland, Virginia.

Politico reports that Brat has also spent time working as an economist in the Army.

Brat got his masters from Princeton Theological Seminary, an institution whose mission statement reads, 'prepares women and men to serve Jesus Christ in ministries marked by faith, integrity, scholarship, competence, compassion, and joy,' notes Politico.

His wife's name is Laura. They live with their two children in the comfortable town of Glen Allen outside Richmond where the median home sells for around $230,000.

He has chaired the Randolph-Macon College's Economics and Business department for the past six years and used the same principles he touts as a teacher to secure the GOP nomination.

‘I’m just running on the founding principles that Adam Smith and free markets – they made us the greatest nation on the Earth. All right?’ he said in May.

‘It’s no mystery. Our rights, tradition, along with free markets and the Judeo-Christian tradition all together made us the greatest nation on the face of the Earth. I think we’re veering off course a little bit there and I want to get us back on that course that brought us to greatness.’

However, it's his stance on immigration that most experts point to as the major source of the conservative's support.

Cantor fought back, boasting in strongly worded mailers of shutting down plans to grant 'amnesty' to 'illegal aliens' - a changed tone for a lawmaker who'd spoken out in favor of citizenship for immigrants brought illegally to this country as youths.

Stunned: House Majority Leader Eric Cantor delivers a concession speech in Richmond. Cantor lost in the GOP primary to tea party candidate Dave Brat, who ran on a staunchly anti-immigration platform

He hardened his stance on the policy, moving to block House action last month on a GOP-authored measure offering citizenship to certain immigrants here illegally who serve in the military.

It wasn't enough.

After a primary election season in which immigration had barely registered, the outcome suggested that it can still be a potent political issue for Republican primary voters.

And Cantor's loss almost certainly ended whatever slim hopes remained for a deal on immigration in the House this year, likely putting the issue on ice until after the 2016 presidential election.

As gave his victory speech, however, Brat credited his supporters and not his support of any controversial issue, for his win.

'This is the happiest moment, obviously, of my life,' he said at an event in Glen Allen. 'The reason we won this campaign, there is just one reason, and that's because dollars do not vote -- you do.'
