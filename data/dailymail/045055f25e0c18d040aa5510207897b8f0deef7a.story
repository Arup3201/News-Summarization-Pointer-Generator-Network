These vintage Star Wars, Disney and Dr Who posters are among a 600-strong collection set to sell for thousands when they go under the hammer this week.

The vast collection dating back to the 1930s was amassed by a Cardiff-born film technician, who had a passion for cinema and the associated poster art.

The film fanatic, who worked as a grip and a camera-rigging technician, has now retired and is living abroad, while his collection will be put up for sale on Friday in Penarth.

Cream of the crop: This vintage Star Wars poster is expected to be one of the most popular bids when a collection of 600 goes up for auction in Cardiff on Friday

Auctioneer Ben Rogers Jones said the posters, which will be sold individually, will make for an astonishing auction.

'I really love films and I think this is a brilliant collection,' he said.

'All the classics and iconic films of the 1930s to 1980s are there. It's like a taking a peek back in time to the films of my childhood and teen years.'
