A 20-year-old student drowned in a river while more than three times over the drink-drive limit after spending the evening playing drinking games with friends, an inquest has heard.

Megan Roberts, a student at York St John University, fell into the River Ouse while walking home from a fancy dress night in January, an inquest heard today.

Police had launched a massive hunt for the student, from Wetherby, West Yorkshire, after she went missing earlier this year.

Megan Roberts, a student at York St John University, fell into the River Ouse, York, while three times over the drink drive limit, an inquest has heard

The 20-year-old (pictured left and right) had been drinking cider, shots and spirits before she went missing in January and friends said they had never seen the fine art student so drunk

The banks of the river were searched and divers were used to try and find her, but police could find no trace.

But a member of the public discovered Megan's body on the muddy river bank, five weeks after she disappeared.

Today, an open verdict was recorded at an inquest into Megan's death, after a coroner said there was 'no evidence' to determine how she ended up in the water.  

But Home Office Pathologist Jennifer Bolton told the court the cause of death was drowning, with a contributing factor of the effects of alcohol. 

Blood tests revealed she had 273 milligrammes of alcohol in her body - three and a half times the legal limit for driving.

Friends also told the inquest they had never seen Megan so drunk and had begged her to go home. 

During the inquest, the coroner was told how the fine art student had drunk four pints of cider and blackcurrant in the students' union bar at the start of a boxing club social on Wednesday, January 22.

Megan had then taken a taxi to a nearby pub where she was seen downing Jagerbombs and cocktails.

Afterwards, she went to Popworld nightclub where she continued to drink spirits. 

The inquest heard how Megan had gone to the students' union in York, as well as another bar, before finishing her night in popworld, pictured above

Many members of the group were downing triple vodkas during the evening and were dressed as superheroes, the court was told.

Megan's best friend Victoria Rose Iveson told the inquest: 'Megan was more drunk than I had ever seen her before. She was really, really drunk. I kept saying she should go home.

'But she was saying she was not ready to go home yet.'

Another friend Bethanie Robinson said: 'We were playing drinking games a group. When I got into the club I could see Megan was already in there.

'She seemed really happy. She appeared to be having a good night. If she had been in a worse state I would have looked after her.'

After the nightclub, Megan was said to have left with some of the students to go to McDonald's in the city centre.

She was later caught on CCTV looking worse for wear and walking into some cycle racks outside a pub, as the group made their way to Lendal Bridge over the River Ouse.

Student Tony Atkin said he jogged down to the arch of the bridge to urinate and believed Megan may have followed him down to the river, but he did not know why.

A figure which may have been Megan was later spotted staggering behind him as he jogged away, the court heard.

Megan was never seen alive again and was reported missing on Monday - five days later - when she failed to turn up for lectures. 

Her body was found five weeks after she went missing by a passer-by

A fruitless police search led to public appeals for information about Megan.

Her body was then spotted on the afternoon of March 2 by James Fearns while he was walking along the river bank with his wife and daughter  at Acastar Malbis, a marina a few miles outside York.

Mr Fearns told the hearing how his wife spotted Megan's body and they phoned 999.  

Recording an open conclusion, Coroner Jonathan Leach said: 'Having consumed a large amount of alcohol by some means she entered the river. She probably fell in due to her senses being impaired.

'There is no evidence at all how she entered the river. In those circumstances, I'm left with no alternative but to enter an open conclusion.'

The inquest was held on the same afternoon as that of Ben Clarkson, a York sales assistant, who also drowned in the river after consuming 263 milligrammes of alcohol.

He was found drowned in the River Foss days later. There was also an open verdict in that case.

Mr Leach added: 'I am holding both on the same day to raise awareness of the dangers of the River Ouse and Foss particularly to those who have drunk large amounts of alcohol.

'In both cases, it is a tragic end to both young lives.'

After the hearing, Megan's mum Jackie said her message to other young drinkers was 'just bear in mind that awful tragedies can happen to nice people'.

She added: 'They were just out having fun. It highlights the dangers. I'm glad it is over. I have been waiting a long time for this.' 

She had previously said in a statement: 'We would like to thank the police, fire service, and the public that have been involved in the search for Megan.

'We would also like to thank everyone who has offered support and comfort during this painful time.

'Megan was an intelligent, talented and beautiful person whose kindness and sense of humour will be greatly missed by everyone who knew and loved her.'

The student's father Jason Roberts had also paid tribute to his daughter after her body was found, saying: 'We would like to thank the police, fire service and the public who have been involved in the search for Megan.

'Megan was a wonderful, kind and loving daughter who will be missed by many.'
