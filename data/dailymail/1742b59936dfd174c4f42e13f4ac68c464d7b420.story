Britons are shunning a traditional breakfast and more and more are starting the day with a burger, new figures reveal.

More than 100 million burgers were eaten as the first meal of the day last year as the breakfast burger soars in popularity.

When British people's breakfast eating habits were monitored, the study showed burger servings before 11 am are up more than six per cent since 2012.

British people are turning their backs on the traditional breakfast and are instead opting to start the day with a burger

But despite its 
growing popularity, bacon sandwiches remain the breakfast of 
choice for British people eating on the go, with 268 million of them 
eaten for breakfast last year.

Just five years ago the breakfast burger only accounted for one in 16 burgers that were bought throughout the day.

Now around one in 12 are bought as a morning meal with the trend for early morning burgers set to grow.

The data comes from the latest research by the NPD Group, which studied what Britons are choosing for breakfast when they are away from home. 

The growing popularity of the breakfast burger means people are shunning traditional fare such as cereal, right. However, the bacon sandwich, left is still the nation's favourite

It also seems that children are driving 
the breakfast burger trend, with adults accompanied by youngsters eating their way through more than 40 million of them as a start to the 
day.

Jack MacIntyre, UK foodservice account manager for the NPD Group, said: 'When people eat breakfast - perhaps on the way to work, or in the office, or as a treat at weekends - burgers are clearly growing in popularity.

'But the breakfast classics - servings of good old-fashioned bacon sandwiches, toast, eggs, sausage and baked beans - are unlikely to be toppled anytime soon.

'And, despite Britain's improving café culture, it doesn't look like continental breakfast favourites such as the croissant are going to sidetrack the appeal of the Great British breakfast.'

NPD's findings were based on a panel of consumers who reported what they had eaten out of home for breakfast.
