Pleaded: John Jenkin, 24, today pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Alice McMeekin and Katie Jenkin

A man axed to death his mother and sister just two days after he was taken to a mental health unit following a suicide attempt, a court heard today.

John Jenkin, 24, took a cocktail of LSD, whisky and painkillers then tried to drown himself in a river and slash his wrists, before passers-by called 999.

Following a 90-minute examination by a psychiatric nurse at Furness General Hospital, Cumbria, he was released and went on to kill Alice McMeekin, 58, and Katie Jenkin, 20, at their family home.

Today he pleaded guilty to two counts of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. He denied their murders.

Preston Crown Court heard that psychiatric experts agreed Jenkin was suffering from a schizophrenic disorder at the time of the offences in Millom on June 8 last year.

Sentencing was adjourned until Thursday to hear medical evidence and decide whether he should be subject to a hospital order or a custodial term.

Anthony Cross QC, prosecuting, said the defendant had made an attempt on his life on June 6.

'He did so by taking 15 Co-codamol tablets, a significant amount of whisky and he took two tablets of LSD,' said the barrister.

'Having taken that combination of intoxicants he went to the banks of a river in Millom and tried to drown himself.'

That bid was unsuccessful and once back on shore he then attempted to slash his wrists, said Mr Cross.

He was seen by two witnesses and was later taken to the Dane Garth Mental Health Unit, attached to Furness General.

Mr Cross said: 'He was described as 
having a medium risk of both grandiosity and worthlessness, and a medium
 risk of a detrimental affect of drug misuse.

'But no other mental health problems are noted or recorded.'

Psychiatric experts for defence and prosecution agreed Jenkin was suffering schizophrenic disorder that day

After killing his mother and sister on the morning of June 8, Jenkin was arrested in 'rather bizarre circumstances' at the scene of the suicide bid, the court was told.

He was found naked by police and had engaged in 'extremely bizarre behaviour'.

Mr Cross said the Crown had found no evidence to indicate that the killings were carried out while he was immediately affected or intoxicated with illicit substances.

But he invited the judge, Mr Justice King, to consider whether the use of drugs taken in the preceding days had aggravated the offences.

Mr Justice King said the matter 'was and is a grave case' whereby the defendant took an axe and 'on any view brutally killed the two victims'.

Jenkin is being treated at maximum-security Ashworth Hospital in Merseyside.
