Cult rapper Riff Raff, known for his bizarre tattoos, corn rows, and fang-like set of bedazzled teeth, will terrorize some unfortunate American dad this spring when he takes a teen to prom.

That is, if anyone coughs up $28,000  for the privilege.

The rapper's rental fee includes a night in a penthouse hotel suite, a ride in a Lamborghini and, in Riff Raff's words, the knowledge 'U are a legend at your school.'

Could this be you? Cult rapper Riff Raff famously took Katy Perry to the 2014 Video Music Awards and now he's offered to take a rich and over-18 high schooler to prom this spring for the low, low price of $28,000

Riff Raff, 32, who was born Horst Simco in Copperfield, Texas, posted his offer and all its myriad perks on Instagram over the weekend for all his 900,000 followers to see.

Those perks include a full week of promotion of the event on Twitter and Instagram 'saying who you are and that he is taking you to prom.'

The lucky, and well-heeled, young Riff Raff fan will also receive, 'freestyle videos and iconic prom pictures all night,' Riff Raff writes.

Aside from his $28,000 fee, Riff Raff requires only that his date be 18-years-old or over.

Riff Raff's lucky date can also revel in knowing that she will be on the arm of the same man who took Katy Perry to the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards. 

He's also the man who inspired James Franco's Alien character from 'Spring Breakers.' 

Riff Raff first gained notoriety after appearing on MTV's From G's to Gents. He's now a beloved hip hop personality, albeit not for his musical talents

That's right! Riff Raff has accompanied a pop princess on the red carpet--where they sported matching mock-ups of the denim cowboy ensembles worn by Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake to the 2001 VMAs.

The Dolce & Gabbana singer decked himself out in chain necklaces, a metallic top and a belt that matched Katy's.

He opted out of wearing a denim hat like JT did back in the day in order to show off his colorful braided hair, though he did arrive on the red carpet carrying one in his hand.

Riff Raff is known more for his off-the-wall style than his musical talents, but that doesn't keep fans from lining up to see him perform songs from his album Neon Icon live.

He first gained notoriety on the MTV show From G's to Gents before breaking out to collaborate with such hip hop notables Lil B, Lil Debbie and Soulja Boy.
