Mark Zuckerberg defiantly pushed forward with the overhaul of Facebook this afternoon as he announced more radical changes to the site with completely new profile pages covering years before the site even existed.

The site founder unveiled some of the biggest changes in the site's history with the introduction of the new 'timeline' profile pages at the company's f8 conference in San Francisco.

The announcement came as Zuckerberg continues to face wide scale anger from users at the way that the news feed was changed at the start of the week.

Unveil: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg introduces Timeline during his keynote address at the Facebook f8 Developers Conference in San Francisc

New profile: The redesigned page looks more like an online scrapbook and users can add photos to their 'timeline' from before Facebook existed, such as photos of their birth

The new timeline feature is reminiscent of an 
online scrapbook, with the most important photos and text that users 
have shared on Facebook over the years.

The timeline can go back to include years before Facebook even existed, so users can add photos and events from, say 1995 when they got married or 1970 when they were born.

Zuckerberg said the new profile page had been designed so that, 'you can tell the whole story of your life on a single page'.

The redesigned pages have a more magazine-like photo-heavy feel, with a large 'cover photo' at the top of the page .

On the right of the page there will be a
 timeline that breaks down all posts from a person's time on Facebook 
and allows viewers to jump back to people's earliest posts with a break down month-by-month.

Features: The profile page has closer integration with apps such as Netflix and Spotify, allowing users to watch films and listen to music on Facebook

For the first time, the site will allow you to add photos and content from before Facebook existed in a new 'Way Back' section.

In his presentation, Zuckerberg showed how to add a baby photo at the beginning of your timeline.

'It's fun and easy to fill out your timeline,' said Zuckerberg.

In other changes to the profile page,
 users will be able to choose what is featured on their timelines, with 
the ability to star favourites to double their size or hide things 
altogether.

Zuckerberg took the stage after a humorous skit, in which Saturday Night Live actor Andy Samberg impersonated him.

The real Mark Zuckerberg looked 
considerably more playful and at ease than he has in past events, 
suggesting he is growing into his role as the public face of Facebook.

But
 he quickly got down to business as he introduced the timeline as 'the 
story of your life - all your stories, all your apps and a new way to 
express who you are.'

Expanding on its ubiquitous 'like' 
buttons, Zuckerberg said Facebook will now let users connect to things 
even if they don't want to 'like' them.

'We
 are making it so you can connect to anything you want. Now you don't 
have to like a book, you can just read a book,' he said.

'You don't have to like a movie; you can just watch a movie.'

The
 latest changes come days after Facebook overhauled the news feed 
feature, which largely succeeded in goading its 750 million users into a
 fury.

Users
 have been infuriated by the overhaul of the site with dozens of 
Facebook groups set up to protest the changes - some with thousands of 
members.

On
 Facebook's official blog more than 7,000 users have offered comments on
 the new 'update' to the news service - many of them furious rants in 
capitals - and a mere 1,800 users have 'Liked' the service.

Tech
 sites are offering 'workarounds' to disable the new features - and many
 users have said on Twitter and Facebook that they are switching to 
using Facebook on smartphones such as iPhone, where the the new News 
Feed and News Ticker have not yet been added to the apps.

The
 focus of most people's anger seems to be the arbitrary way in which the
 site 'chooses' which stories might be 'important' to you - general 
opinion is that the site seems to invariably choose wrongly.

All change: Zuckerberg has made several announcements this week as the site has faced competition from the likes of Google+

The new update to the site 'splits' 
news into 'top stories' - the company declined to explain how these are 
chosen for each individual - and a 'news ticker' that crawls up the 
right side of the screen, adding updates as they come in.

'I want to choose my own news and my own friends. I do not need Facebook to choose these items for me,' said one commenter.

'News Feed is awful.  It's 
taking me much longer now to find the news I really want, now that 
Facebook has decided incorrectly that some algorithm knows better than I
 do,' said another.

Although Facebook is still the 
worldâ€™s largest social networking site with 750million users, it has 
been under pressure from Google and other media sites for a number of 
months, especially since the launch of Google+.

Spoof: SNL's Andy Sandberg introduces the new fake features while pretending to be Mark Zuckerberg

Before Mark Zuckerberg launched the latest changes to the site, 'Saturday Night Live' cast member Andy Samberg took to the stage to introduce two new fake features.

Wearing Zuckerberg's usual attire of a hoodie and sandals, Samberg did his impersonation of the Facebook founder, which has become a regular feature on the show.

'Let's get to the part where I brag about user growth,' Samberg said. 'We continue to expand to the point where we've stop counting you guys.

'It's more than the population of Europe, the cast of 'Glee' and the 
amount of people claiming they came up with Facebook. Burn!'

Samberg then introduced the 'I'm not really friends with these people' section of the site.

The fake Zuckerberg said the new feature would be a place on your friends list to put people that you feel obligated to be friends with, but that you do not really like.

'It's the perfect place to put awkward friends from middle school, older drunk women you meet at charity events, racist neighbours, and aunts,' he said.

Then he revealed the 'slow poke', which is a poke that moves so slowly that you can take it back if for example you gave the poke while drunk.

'The Slow Poke' gives users 24 hours to 'realise you're an idiot' before it is sent to the friend.

The real Zuckerberg then took to the stage interrupting the monologue saying, 'drop the act now, man'.

'The slow poke isn't even a real feature,' Zuckerberg said while chuckling. 'The deal 
was I was supposed to feed you real information through the earpiece.'
