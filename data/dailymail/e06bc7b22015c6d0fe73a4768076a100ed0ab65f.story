There's being the runt of the litter.

And then there's this.

The poor little piglet pictured here was born with conjoined heads and has two noses, two mouths and three eyes.

He came into the world among a litter of 10 that was born recently in Nanchang, capital of eastern China's Jiangxi Province.

Snout and about: This little piggy has two snout and three eyes, only one of which you can see here

Farmer Du Gensheng said: 'The others were normal, except this one.

'When it tries to suckle the milk, it hesitates about which mouth to suckle the nipples.

'And sometimes one mouth wants to suck this nipple, while the other mouth tries another nipple, and then both failed.'

Unfortunately, vets say the piggy will find it difficult to survive.

Many animals can be affected by the condition of having two heads, which is known as polycephaly.

In 2009, a snake with two heads was found in a drawer full of rubbish in the US, while a cat suffering the same deformity was born in Australia a year earlier.
