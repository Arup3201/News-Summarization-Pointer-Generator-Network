Usain Bolt was in fine fettle out and about in London on Wednesday night.

Beaming for the cameras after dining with his friends at trendy London restaurant Nozomi, Bolt was wearing a floral shirt and donned a baseball cap and sunglasses.

The world's fastest man was also showing off on Instagram, posting a video of himself performing a bizarre rap.

Still wearing the baseball cap, it seems as if the Jamaican superstar is better at sprinting than he is at flowing lyrics.

Bolt was due to run in the Diamond League meeting in Zurich this week, but pulled out due to injury as a result bringing his season to an early end.

The six-time Olympic champion, who will resume training in October, will be looking to retain his world 100m and 200m crowns at the World Championships in Beijing next year.

The world's fastest man has competed only four times this year.

He ran twice at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow as he anchored Jamaica to 4x100m relay gold on the Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, in the Mano a Mano race where he won in 10.06secs and then in Warsaw, where his time was an unofficial world best for an indoor 100m.

Bolt had been due to take on Great Britain's European champions James Dasaolu and Adam Gemili in Zurich before the latest injury news.
