Photos of a naked, young woman at Spring Break, enclosed in a group of raucous male party-goers, has left authorities fearing for her safety amid wider concerns about the annual event.

Police were searching for the woman who was stark naked wearing only sunglasses and colorful necklaces in images shared on social media on March 11.

The Bay County Sheriff's Office in Florida have not been able to identify the girl and there was not enough background detail in the photographs to pinpoint her location.

Sheriff Frank McKeithen told Daily Mail Online on Friday that the photos had been deeply concerning to law enforcement because of how young the girl looked, and their main priority was to find out if she was safe.

Police in Bay County, Florida were searching for a young woman on Spring Break earlier this month who caused concern after being pictured naked wearing only sunglasses and strings of colorful beads while surrounded by men

'She isn't in trouble,' Sheriff McKeithen said. 'We want to be proactive about her safety.'

An investigation was underway into the photographs and how they ended up on social media, the sheriff confirmed.  

Bay County officials were alerted to the photos after they were posted to Twitter on March 11.

In one of the pictures, the young woman was bent over and dancing naked at the water's edge on a beach in the Gulf of Mexico.

The Bay County Sheriff’s Office (BCSO) provided a breakdown of criminal activity between March 5 - 15 this year, with three weeks of Spring Break still to go: 

In a separate shot, she appeared to be trying to cover her body while a group of men gathered around her.

In another picture, the scene was more aggressive. The girl appeared to be trying to escape the frame but was surrounded by shirtless men.

One of the men was grabbing the necklaces at her throat.

Anyone with information has been asked to contact the Bay County Sheriff's Office at 850-747-4700 or Crime Stoppers at 850-785-TIPS (8477).

Panama City Beach in Bay County is the country's top destination for students on Spring Break.

Sheriff McKeithen told Daily Mail Online on Friday that his officers, along with the Panama City Beach Police, face an overwhelming wave of criminal activity during the five weeks of Spring Break, when their community swells from 12,000 people to an estimated 100-300,000.

'We have a mess here... this is not the traditional Spring Break of the past,' the sheriff said. 

'The kids themselves are posting videos of them having sex on the beach and getting into fights.'

He called Spring Break an 'emotional roller coaster' both for the students who end up victims of violence and sexual assault and for his officers, who work double shifts to cope with the influx.

'The majority of sexual assaults are not reported, because they feel shame, are embarrassed, have never likely been this intoxicated before and are far from home,' the police chief said.

'But our message is this - no matter how intoxicated you are, if you are violated, we take that very seriously.'

Although the sheriff offered no exact figures on the cost of policing Spring Break, he said that the $150,000 given in assistance by the Tourist Development Council 'barely scratched the surface'. 

The crowd packed the beach during Spring Break festivities in Panama City Beach, Florida on March 12. Bay County authorities believe that the naked, young woman was on a beach somewhere in this area

Along with hundreds of thousands of drunk, college kids pouring into the town, there was also the dangerous elements that a group this large, with money to burn and wanting to experiment, attraced. 

'Build it and they will come,' the sheriff said. 

Among 22 people arrested at a local bar this weekend in a narcotics sting, was a 39-year-old man from Nashville, Tennessee, who was selling the synthetic party drug, known as 'molly'.

Heroin and prescription drugs have also been seized.

Weapons were also a growing problem - arrests had uncovered a Glock and an AK-47 during Spring Break.

McKeithen said earlier this week that the number of incidents so far this year showed the changes designed to tone down Spring Break haven't worked. These included a 2am closing time for alcohol sales. 

Sheriff McKeithen said: 'We can't ''police it'' away, that's not going to fix the problem. We are doing the best we can. At some point, someone has to decide whether this is what we want or don't want.

'I am trying to keep people and our officers safe.'
