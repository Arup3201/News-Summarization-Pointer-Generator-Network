MPs have given themselves an extra week's holiday next year - because of the Scottish independence referendum.

The House of Commons authorities announced that MPs would sit for just 145 days in 2014, although a few more Friday sittings will be added once decisions have been made.

But the total will be a week less than this year, because they will give themselves time off around 18 September, when the referendum is held.

The change has occurred because the Lib Dems, who would normally hold their party conference in the third week of September, had to move their gathering so as not to clash with the vote.

Time off: The House of Commons authorities announced that MPs would sit for just 145 days in 2014

Their conference will now be held in October next year, necessitating a week off at Westminster. But the week off which usually happens in September will not be scrapped.

Taking into account bank holidays and annual leave, most people work around 224 days in a year - around 15 weeks more than MPs will be expected to at Westminster.

The move to change the parliamentary timetable for the referendum has been blasted by critics. They point out it will affect the hundreds of English, Welsh and Northern Irish MPs who have no interest in the Scottish question.

Robert Oxley, of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Cutting the number of days Parliament is sitting further undermines the ability of MPs to hold the Government and ministers to account.'

The sitting dates for 2014 were 
announced by Lib Dem Tom Brake. It's because his party has moved its 
autumn conference to accommodate the independence vote that MPs look set
to spend even fewer days in Westminster next year.

The
Lib Dems were due to have their Glasgow get-together before the 
referendum but switched it to October to avoid a clash. But instead of 
moving the customary 'conference recess' back a week, it's been 
extended.

Labour's Shadow leader of the House, Angela Eagle, said: 'I understand why the Scottish referendum has disrupted the usual arrangements but it seems a bit strange that we have had to make changes to accommodate the 2014 Liberal Democrats conference.

'At the rate they are losing members, next year they could hold it in a telephone box.'

MPs spend four days a week in Westminster. There are a number of Friday sittings each year yet to be announced which will boost the 145 day total. However, it's likely MPs will also award themselves around a week off for prorogation - the lead up to the State Opening of Parliament by the Queen in May that is likely to coincide with campaigning for the European elections.

The Conservative's slogan for their party conference this year was 'For Hardworking People'.
