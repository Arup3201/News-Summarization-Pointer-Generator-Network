With his sister Patrizia Messina Denaro (pictured) arrested today, police say that they have never been closer to catching mafia boss Matteo Messina Denaro

Close family members of the Sicilian Mafia's fugitive 'boss of bosses' have been arrested with police saying they are closing in on the kingpin.

Police hunting Matteo Messina Denaro, who runs Sicily's Cosa Nostra operation arrested his sister Patrizia, his nephew and two cousins.

Investigators called Friday's pre-dawn sweep a major step in their quest to capture Messina Denaro, who has been at large since 1993.

The capture of other Mafia fugitives has now left the kingpin as the top Cosa Nostra figure being sought.

Carabinieri commander Mario Parente said: 'We have never come as close to Matteo Messina Denaro as today.'

In total, police said around 30 people were arrested around Trapani in the west of the Italian island in a major operation that they called a 'hard blow' to the Mafia leadership around the fugitive boss.

Police also say they have confiscated 
more than Â£5million worth of property believed to belong to the missing 
crime boss and his family.

Messina Denaro, 50, who was once known as the 'Playboy Boss' because of his love of fast cars, women and gold watches, has been a fugitive since 1993.

He has been running the crime group since the arrest in 2006 of Bernardo Provenzano after nearly four decades as a fugitive.

Police said they believed Messina 
Denaro's 43-year-old sister and other arrested family members maintained
contact with the boss and helped him run the crime syndicate.

The
arrested were accused of belonging to a criminal group and extortion 
related to the control of a number of construction companies in Sicily.
