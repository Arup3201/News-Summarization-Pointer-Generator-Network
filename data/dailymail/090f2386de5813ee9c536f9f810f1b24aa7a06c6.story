A newly-discovered deep, cold current flowing off Iceland's coast may mean the North Atlantic is less sensitive to climate change than previously thought.

The North Icelandic Jet feeds the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation - or AMOC - a giant pattern known as the 'great ocean conveyor belt', which regulates North American and European climates.

Scientists had previously believed that most of the cold water that formed 
that deep south-flowing stream came from off the Greenland coast and was
made up of fresh glacier-melt water.

Hit movie The Day After Tomorrow showed how a new ice age overtakes America and Europe in the wake of a catastrophic climatic shift

However, the North 
Icelandic Jet appears to contribute more to the deeper part of the AMOC 
than the Greenland current does, according to scientists.

The 'conveyor belt' current was introduced in the Al Gore environmental film An Inconvenient 
Truth, and carries warm surface water from the tropical Atlantic toward the
Arctic.

In the process, the water warms the 
air in high latitudes, then cools, sinks and returns towards the equator,
flowing as a deep stream at lower ocean depths.

Because fresh water freezes at a 
higher temperature than salt water, these specialists suggested that 
this fresh water from glaciers and other warming-related phenomena would
get into the North Atlantic, where it could freeze and prevent the 
water from sinking to make up the bottom of the conveyor belt.

If that happened, and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation was disrupted or slowed at the place in 
the far north where the warm water at the surface cools and sinks - called the overturning - it could eventually lead to a colder Northern 
Hemisphere.

Study co-author Robert Pickart, of the
Woods Hold Oceanographic Institution, said: 'Present thinking contends that increased
fresh water delivered to the North Atlantic, due to melting ice and 
increased precipitation under a warming climate, will slow down or halt 
the overturning of the AMOC.'

This might not be the case if the 
overturning occurs in the interior of the Iceland Sea, which feeds the 
North Icelandic Jet, Dr Pickart added.

'It
is not inconceivable that this open-ocean process is less sensitive to 
fresh water forcing than the presently accepted mechanism ... which 
might lead one to speculate that the deepest part of the overturning may
be less sensitive to climate change,' he said.

The existence of the North Icelandic Jet was suspected for decades but was only confirmed recently by Icelandic researchers using underwater velocity measurements taken from a ship.

The current cannot be seen by satellites or detected by its temperature or salinity, but it does move a bit faster than the surrounding water, Pickart said.

Pickart and researchers from Norway and Iceland don't know whether the North Icelandic Jet flows year round or how it varies with time.

They are beginning a research voyage this week to deploy oceanographic instruments to directly measure the North Icelandic Jet over the course of a full year to try to figure out where and how this current forms.

The research is published in the 
journal Nature Geoscience.
