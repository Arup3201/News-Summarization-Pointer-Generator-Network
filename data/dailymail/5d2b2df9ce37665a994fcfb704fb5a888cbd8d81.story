One of the country’s largest energy firms said it was likely to freeze prices until 2015 after George Osborne unveiled plans to reduce green levies.

Ahead of his Autumn Statement this week the Chancellor gave details of reforms which he said would see £50 shaved off energy bills.

He also announced new handouts of up to £1,000 for homeowners to spend on insulation and energy-efficient boilers - saying it would be funded by a fresh crackdown on tax avoidance.

But last night one Tory backbencher said David Cameron would be able to reduce gas and electricity bills further if he stopped listening to his Liberal Democrat colleagues and axed the green levies altogether.

George Osborne’s Autumn Statement on Thursday will include a range of changes, including a freeze in business taxes for small firms, and a £250million boost to the British Business Bank to help small companies access funding.

And he confirmed yesterday that it would include an announcement that the government would pay for some green measures currently included in people’s bills - cutting the cost for families across the country.

In addition, energy firms will be given two years longer to hit targets on the insulation of homes, enabling costs to consumers to be spread out.

The moves were welcomed by the energy firms - and the Chancellor said he was certain that the average £50 saving from slashing the Energy Company Obligation - would be passed on by energy firms to consumers.

‘This will help families,’ he said. ‘We’ve been in discussions with the energy companies. We are absolutely insistent that this is going to be brought in.’

A spokesman for EDF said its ‘decision to hold back the full impact of rising costs’ earlier this month by implementing lower rise than competitors had been ‘validated by the conformation that the Government will take action on energy changes’.

‘Customers should expect other energy suppliers to follow EDF’s lead by significantly lowering their prices,’ he said.

In addition, anyone buying a home will be eligible for the £1,000 grant for energy efficiency measures, such as installing insulation or replacing the boiler. The sum could be even higher if the property needs a great deal of work.

Asked how £1,000 grants for homebuyers to improve energy efficiency and cuts to environmental levies on bills would be funded, Mr Osborne replied: ‘The money will come from additional taxes that we will raise from dealing with tax avoidance.’

He refused to give details of the tax avoidance crackdown but said people were wrong to be sceptical about whether such action really raised revenue.

‘This government has taken step after step and the amount of tax we collect from people who were previously avoiding their tax goes up by billions of pounds over this parliament,’ he said.

The Chancellor attacked Labour’s pledge of a 20-month freeze on energy prices if they win the election - which has been dominating the political agenda since Ed Miliband announced it in September.

‘We are doing it in the way that government can do it, which is controlling the costs that families incur because of government policies,’ he said.

‘We are also doing it in the way that is not going to damage the environment or in any way reduce our commitment to dealing with climate change.’

Lib Dem president Tim Farron claimed credit for the retention of green levies - after reports that Mr Cameron had wanted to get rid of some of the green ‘c***’ in his policies.

‘It’s been a job and a half over the last month to make sure we hold him to those pledges and the green core of this government,’ he said. ‘And that is why we are not scrapping the investment; we’re just making sure it’s funded from general taxation - that is absolutely right.

‘Fuel bills is a huge and important issue... but I’ll tell you what, all those things even pale into insignificance compared to the threat of climate change so we absolutely must hold the Prime Minister to account on this issue.’

Chancellor George Osborne

Last night Tory backbencher Douglas Carswell said: ‘David Cameron should be responding to the common sense of the British people, rather than to Lib Dems like Tim Farron.

‘This is the tragedy of Coalition as it prevents people taking the proper choices rather than, like the Lib Dems, posing and preening.’

Ed Miliband will today dismiss the Government’s energy levies shake-up as ‘smoke and mirrors’, saying ministers do not ‘get’ the cost-of-living crisis.

The Labour leader is to insist that the ‘cosy deal’ reached with the ‘Big Six’ power firms will still see bills going up this winter.

‘A lot of people think that David Cameron and George Osborne are trying to catch up with One Nation Labour on the cost-of-living crisis: from pay-day lending to energy bills,’ he will say.

‘But the truth is they are struggling to catch up with the British people who live at the sharp end of an economy where the link between the wealth of our nation and family finances has been broken. That is the cost-of-living crisis that is happening in our country today.

‘That is how this Government and any government will be judged. And it is how the Autumn Statement will be judged.’

Jonathan Reynolds MP, Labour’s Shadow Energy and Climate Change Minister, said: ‘The Energy Company Obligation is David Cameron’s scheme. He only introduced it this year and a few months ago he was even boasting that it was bigger than previous energy efficiency schemes.

‘Labour has consistently said that ECO should be reformed to make it better value for money and targeted at those in fuel poverty.

'But what the public really needs is a Labour government implementing a price freeze until 2017 and resetting the energy market so that it works for the long term.’

Climate change policies are expected to cost Britain £85billion by the end of the decade, a think-tank has claimed. Benny Peiser, of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, said: ‘The public has absolutely no idea how staggeringly costly and excessive the Government’s climate initiatives are.’
