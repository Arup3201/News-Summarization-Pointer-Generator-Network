Hunt: Paranoid schizophrenic and convicted murderer Daniel Rosenthal, 58, has been found in Southampton this morning after going missing from a mental health hospital

One of Britain’s most brutal murderers who hacked both his mother and 
father to death has been found in Southampton today after he escaped from a mental health 
hospital.

Paranoid schizophrenic Daniel Rosenthal, 58,  was last seen at 2.30pm yesterday taking 'a routine unsupervised walk around the gardens' of Tatchbury Mount Hospital, Totton.

His disappearance sparked a huge police manhunt with members of the public warned not to approach him.

But Hampshire Police said today that the killer was found in Southampton this morning.

A police spokesman said: 'Daniel Rosenthal was located in Southampton around 
11am this morning and has returned to Tatchbury Mount Hospital.

'Police would like to thank members of the public and the media for their assistance with enquiries into his whereabouts.'

Rosenthal, 58, was dubbed the ‘mad scientist’ when he was jailed for life 
in 1981 after dismembering his mother’s body with a hacksaw.

A court 
heard he hacked his father to death in France and dumped his body near 
Paris before returning to the family home in Hampshire to kill his 
mother.

Rosenthal is a patient at Tatchbury Mount Hospital which is on the edge of the New Forest in Totton, near Southampton.

The hospital, run by Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust, is just 15 miles from the family home in Hedge End, near Southampton, where he brutally killed his mother.

After he was found this morning, Dr Julian Lewis, Tory MP for New Forest East, questioned why Rosenthal was given the freedom of taking unsupervised walks.

He said: 'Whilst it is a relief that this man has been found, it is disturbing that someone regarded as a danger to the public - who should not be approached - was allowed to go for unsupervised walks.'

Rosenthal was locked up after Winchester
Crown Court heard he hacked his father Milton to death in Paris, then 
hid the body in a British bin bag in a forest 100 miles from the French 
capital.

He then returned to England and killed 
his 60 year old mother, Leah Rosenthal, cutting up her body with a 
hacksaw at their house.

Her body was never found and police believe her remains were unwittingly carted off by dustmen. He could not be charged with the murder of his father.

Rosenthal was dubbed ‘the mad scientist’ because of weird experiments he carried out on chicken eggs and embryos in a ‘lab’ he built in the living room.

He claimed to be a ‘genius’ and would leave bloodied feathers and chicken remains - the remnants of his bizarre experiments - in bags for the dustmen.

The home in Hedge End was finally sold for £50,000 in 1994 and Rosenthal collected a sum of £16,000 despite serving a life sentence.

At the time a spokesman for the 
solicitors’ firm dealing with his mother’s will said they hoped he would
never be able to spend the money.

She added: 'Our worst nightmare is of Daniel Rosenthal on the streets again.'

Speaking earlier today, Hampshire Police spokesman Julie Knight said today: 'We are conducting an ongoing, extensive search for Daniel Rosenthal.

'He is considered potentially dangerous and a risk to the public.

'Police are urging members of the public to report any sightings of him by calling 999 and should not approach him.

'He is a patient from Tatchbury Mount Hospital, Totton, and has been missing since around 2.30pm on August 10.

'Rosenthal, who is 58-years-old, is diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and is a convicted murderer.

'He was last seen at about 2.30pm, when he went for a routine, unsupervised walk around the gardens of the hospital.

'Police have carried out initial searches in the hospital, its grounds and the surrounding areas. Other enquiries are progressing.

'Rosenthal has been known to visit various areas of the New Forest and Southampton.'
