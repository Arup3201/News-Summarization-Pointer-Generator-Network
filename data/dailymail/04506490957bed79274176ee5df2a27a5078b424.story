Teacher yesterday backed a major escalation of strike action which could close thousands of schools during the summer term.

Chanting ‘Gove must go’, activists from the National Union of Teachers – the most militant classroom union – voted overwhelmingly for a national strike unless ministers agree to a series of demands on pensions and automatic pay rises.

Delegates at the NUT’s annual conference in Brighton passed an emergency motion which demanded strike action in the week beginning June 23 unless ‘significant’ progress is made in resolving the long-running dispute with the Government.

The summer strikes will overlap with  the end of the exam season, although the union insisted its intention is not to disrupt tests. Staff would be able to cross picket lines in the event of a clash with an exam, the NUT said.

Last month a national strike forced the closure of 3,000 schools and pushed thousands more on to reduced timetables.

Conference delegates also raised the prospect of a series of walkouts during the autumn term and in 2015 as they step up their campaign against government reforms.

Proposing the motion, the NUT’s treasurer, Ian Murch, branded Education Secretary Michael Gove a ‘demented Dalek on speed’.

The campaign is mainly aimed at derailing the introduction of performance-related pay and changes to pension rules, and tackling ‘excessive’ workloads.

The new system of performance-related pay, due to be introduced in September, would bring automatic pay rises to an end, with schools given the flexibility to offer higher salaries to their best teachers.

Under the old system teachers were previously virtually guaranteed £2,000 annual rises.

But under the new system salary rises will be linked to annual appraisals instead of length  of service.

Teachers will be expected to show they have achieved good results with their pupils and kept order in the classroom.

But the NUT claims the new system is ‘unfair’ and will lead to pay cuts for many because of budget constraints.

Changes to pensions would make them less generous and mean teachers retiring later.

The strike resolution was backed by a large majority of delegates at the conference yesterday but was not passed unanimously. Afterwards, delegates stood up cheering and chanting: ‘Gove must go.’

The motion leaves ‘flexibility’ for any summer walkout to be longer than a day, although a one-day strike was thought to be the most likely scenario.

About one in eight schools in England was forced to close fully when the NUT staged a one-day walkout last month, according to government estimates, although it is thought that many more were partially shut.

The NASUWT, the other big teaching union, also left open the possibility of a strike at its conference in Birmingham but did not set a date. If it joined with the NUT, thousands more schools would be affected.

At least a dozen GCSE and  A-level papers are scheduled for the first two days of the week proposed in the NUT’s resolution, with one advanced maths extension paper scheduled for the Wednesday of that week.

NUT general secretary Christine Blower said: ‘Strike action will not disrupt exams. If necessary, exemptions can be given to staff who are needed to supervise an exam, but the NUT is looking to take action at the end of the main exam season.’

But Miss Blower admitted that a June strike would could cause disruption. ‘Of course parents will say this is inconvenient, it is inconvenient,’ she said.

‘It’s actually in the nature of industrial action that you do it because you want to cause inconvenience because you’re trying to bring your grievances to people’s attention.’

In a controversial speech, Mr Murch described Mr Gove as ‘a parody of an Education Secretary’. He continued: ‘Michael Gove, the man with a mad idea for every occasion.

‘Michael Gove, the demented Dalek on speed who wants to exterminate anything good in education that’s come along since the 1950s. Michael Gove, the man who says he wants to set schools free and then sends in the Spanish inquisition.’

A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘Ministers have met frequently with the NUT and other unions and will continue to do so.

‘Further strike action will only disrupt parents’ lives, hold back children’s education and damage the reputation of the profession.

‘We know that the vast majority of our teachers and school leaders are hard-working and dedicated professionals.

‘That is why we are giving teachers more freedoms than ever and cutting unnecessary paperwork and bureaucracy.'
