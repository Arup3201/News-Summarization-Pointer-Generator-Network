Jake Newsome - who posted disgusting messages on Facebook after the death of Ann Maguire - has been jailed for six weeks

A Facebook troll who posted sickening messages about the classroom killing of teacher Ann Maguire has been jailed for six weeks.

Jake Newsome, 21, wrote that a 15-year-old boy accused of murdering the school teacherÂ  Maguire should have 'p***** on her too'.

He took to the social networking site three days after Mrs Maguire died was stabbed at Corpus Christi college in Leeds, West Yorkshire, on April 28.

He later admitted posting the messages to police, claiming he empathised with the 15-year-old charged with her murder because he identified with him.

Prosecutor Sandra White told Leeds Magistrates Court today: 'This message was posted to the Facebook social network on May 1 from Mr Newsome's phone.

'He wrote: "Personally, I'm glad that teacher got stabbed up. Feel sorry for the kid, he should've p***** on her too".

'Four minutes later a comment was posted saying,"That's not very nice", to which the defendant replied, "I think it is".'

Angry web users later began posting comments in response and Newsome was arrested. He told police he 'didn't think [the messages] were offensive', the court heard.

Ann Glen, for Newsome, said her client had no previous convictions and he understood he would 'reap the consequences, realising that he had offended members of the public'.

At a previous hearing she told the court: 'He felt that there were some similarities as to what people were saying about the young man and the background that this defendant has.'

Pupils and staff were devastated when Mrs Maguire was killed at Corpus Christi College, Leeds, in April

After Newsome admitted sending an offensive message at a previous hearing he was sentenced by District Judge David Kitson today.

The judge said: 'You sent an offensive communication by an electronic device that followed the tragic death of Mrs Maguire who was killed some days previously.

'You're entitled to express reasonable views, as are all of us. What none of us are entitled to do is abuse that freedom.

Friends of much-loved Mrs Maguire were left stunned by the sickening messages Newsome left on Facebook

'What I find particularly offensive - that must have caused distress to all those who knew Mrs Maguire - were the derogatory remarks made saying that you were glad she had been killed and that he should have, and I quote, "p***** on her too".

'I can think of little more that can be upsetting or offensive.'

Judge Kitson added: 'You clearly came from a troubled background. But this is so serious that nothing more than custodial sentence can suffice.'

Newsome, wearing a dark hoodie and blue jeans, looked shocked at the decision and some of his friends sobbed in the public gallery as he was led away.

Mrs Maguire, 61, died after she was attacked as she taught a Spanish lesson.

The 15-year-old boy has appeared in court accused of murdering Mrs Maguire. He is remanded in custody and is due to go on trial later this year.
