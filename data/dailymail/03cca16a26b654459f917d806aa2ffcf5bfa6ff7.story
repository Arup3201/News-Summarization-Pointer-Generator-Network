Erik Lamela loves a 'rabona' goal. In fact, the Tottenham midfielder has been doing it for years.

Long before the 22-year-old moved to White Hart Lane for a club-record £30million, Lamela was using his go-to trick in Argentina for the youth team of River Plate.

If it works, you're a God. If it doesn't, you're a fool. But Lamela appears to have the art of the 'rabona' down after his audacious outside-of-the-box strike against Asteras Tripolis on Thursday.

Born: Argentina, March 4 1992 (age 22)

2009-2011: River Plate 

2011-2013: Roma 

2013-NOW: Tottenham Hotspur

The question is, which one was better? 

Lamela's goal for River Plate was one-on-one, on the move and finished with a cheeky chip over the approaching goalkeeper.

His 'rabona' against Asteras, however, will take some beating as it glided into the far corner beyond goalkeeper Tomas Kosicky from more than 18 yards out.

The man nicknamed 'Coco' may not have total confidence in his right foot but, when capable of that with the left, little can be done to criticise the Argentina international.

Lamela's incredible strike doubled Tottenham's lead against the visitors as they went on to win 5-1

It prompted Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino to say afterwards: 'Was it the best goal scored by one of my teams in my career? Probably, yes. 

'He practises it every day in training. It’s a goal only a player with his skill can score.'

Lamela's incredible strike on Thursday night was part of his brace and a 5-1 win in the Europa League for Pochettino's side with Harry Kane adding a hat-trick.

Bayern Munich's Arjen Robben and Real Madrid's James Rodriguez  have tried it...

But how do they compare to Lamela's 'rabona' for Tottenham and River Plate?
