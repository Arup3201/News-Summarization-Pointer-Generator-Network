The Church of England yesterday published a prayer for the General Election that called on its congregations to vote for ‘policies that sustain the poor’.

In a move likely to plunge its relations with Tory leaders to a new low, the Church issued an election prayer that urged its followers to pray to ‘help us turn our backs on self-interest’.

In the wake of controversial election advice put out by CofE bishops earlier this year that urged support for the European Union, the prayer also asked churchgoers to ‘work for unity and co-operation throughout the world’.the Church issued an election prayer that urged its followers to pray to ‘help us turn our backs on self-interest’.

It was published in a ‘study guide’ to the ‘pastoral letter’ on the election produced by bishops in February. The letter was taken by Tories as a campaign against the market economy, consumerism and the legacy of Margaret Thatcher.

The new study guide from the Church’s Mission and Public Affairs Division underlined the call for consideration of ‘relationships among the nations of Europe who share a long history moulded by the Christian faith’.

It repeated demands for ‘a fresh debate’ on nuclear weapons, and said those who care about tackling debt should also care ‘about the burdens borne by the most vulnerable in society’.

Two prayers were offered: in one worshippers were asked to pray to ‘help us turn our backs on self-interest and to support policies that sustain the poor, the vulnerable and the frightened people of this world’.

A second prayer calls for protection ‘from the sins of despair and cynicism’ and ‘the idols of false utopias’.

A source close to Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘It is truly bizarre that they are praying to sustain people in poverty. Surely the aim should be to support people to lift themselves out of poverty? Which is exactly what we have been doing through our welfare reforms: giving everyone who is able to work the skills and the opportunities to do so.’

Sir Gerald Howarth, a former Tory defence minister, said: ‘The Church of England needs to be very clear that it is not endorsing the Labour Party, whose language this slightly mirrors.’
