A woman who proudly calls herself the 'black Rapunzel' refuses to cut her 21ft-long hair even though it is damaging her health.

Asha is so addicted to growing her dreadlocks she has dismissed a doctor's orders to lop them off to cure her neck and back pain.

Instead she prefers to lug around her locks, which, when wet, can weigh more than 250lbs - as much as a professional wrestler.

TV star: Asha featured on My Strange Addiction on TLC on Sunday night

Among the others to feature on the 
TLC show include Margaret, 53, from Morning View, Kentucky, who stings 
herself more than 100 times a week with bees.

She began stinging herself over 10 years ago after reading bee stings helped with arthritis.

It initially gave her some relief, but then became so addicted, she sometimes stings herself up to 20 times in her hip alone.

Obsessive: Margaret started the bizarre habit over 10 years ago after reading bee stings helped with arthritis

Health risk: Margaret reckons she's stung herself more than 50,000 times since her addiction began

She's stung herself more than 50,000 
times since her addiction began - and even keeps bee hives in her back 
garden for a constant supply, even though she admits she does feel 
guilty as bees die after they have used their stinger.

After her husband JD and friends told
 her the addiction was getting out of control, Margaret consulted a 
doctor who warned her the next sting could be fatal.

While Margaret has been unable to give up her addiction, she has curbed it to just 10 stings or fewer a day now.

Another woman plagued by addiction is 19-year-old Brea, from Kansas City, who has been eating sand for the past five years after accidentally getting some in her mouth on a trip to the beach.

The teenager loves the feel and crunch of the sand and began eating it every day.

She uses it as a dip for tortilla chips and even dips her chewing gum in it.

She also eats it straight out of a bowl with a spoon and always carries a small red box of sand with her wherever she goes.

Supply and demand: Brea, who has eaten sand 11,000 times, usually picks up it from the floor of her playground

Brea has eaten sand 11,000 times since her addiction began and she usually picks up it from the floor of her local playground.

However, sometimes when her stash is 
low she turns to disposable nail files, which she believes have the same
 texture as sand, and chews on them instead.

After her teeth began to hurt and she suffered stomach aches, Brea's sister managed to talk her into seeing a doctor.

She had X-rays taken of her stomach 
by Dr Richard Gilroy who told her that while she had no permanent damage
 yet she should stop eating the sand as it could have parasites in it 
and make her extremely ill. Since seeing Dr Gilroy, Brea has given up 
eating sand but still snacks on nail files.
