Rachael Thompson, 40, has been found guilty of slashing her baby boy's heels with a razor blade

A mother faces jail for slashing her baby son's feet with razor blades and causing 'horrific' injuries.

Rachael Thompson, 40, was found guilty of slicing the four-month-old's heels, as the jury heard that the wounds could only have been caused deliberately.

Thompson took her son into hospital two days after attacking him, claiming the injuries were an accident.

She said the boy had somehow cut himself on a razor which had fallen into his bath.

Jo Martin, prosecuting, said Thompson told medics she had been bathing the child when she left him with her partner.

She claimed she had come back to find the child's feet bleeding and a razor blade lying in the tub.

But Derriford Hospital A&E nurse Emma Congdon contacted social services when she became suspicious about why Thompson had waited two days to bring her son in.

She said the mother told her the baby had 'kicked' the razor into the bath.

She told the court the boy's wounds were 'horrific', adding: 'You would not leave a four month old baby on its own in the bath.'

Ms Martin said police consulted an expert who said a falling razor would be unlikely to slice into a baby's feet.

And even if it did, it would cut in a 'criss-cross' fashion rather deliver a clean, identical wound to both heels, she said.

At a hearing earlier this month, an expert who tried to reconstruct an accident using a wooden model of a baby’s leg covered in pig skin could not replicate the wounds.  

The boy spent a night in hospital before being released. 

Plymouth Crown Court in Devon, where Thompson was found guilty of slicing her son's feet

The child still lives in Plymouth, Devon, with Thompson and her partner Trevor Parkins, who have another son together, aged 15 months.

Thompson, a former nursing auxiliary and dental nurse, also has a 22-year-old son from an earlier relationship.

Thompson has a history of self-harm and suffered from a personality disorder caused by childhood abuse and bullying at school, the court heard.

She has also suffered from the eating disorder bulimia for most of her adult life.

After her arrest, Thompson told police: 'I would never hurt my child'. 

But it took the jury just two and a half hours to find her guilty at Plymouth Crown Court. 

She was convicted of assaulting the boy between September 14 and September 18, 2011, and has been released on bail until sentencing on November 7.
