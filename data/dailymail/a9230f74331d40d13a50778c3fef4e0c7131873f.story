Forecasters today warned of more heavy rain for parts of Britain as flood-hit communities in the South West braced themselves for further problems.

The Met Office issued an amber warning of severe weather, while the Environment Agency has 130 flood alerts and 12 flood warnings in place.

Somerset County Council has declared a ‘major incident’ for all areas affected by flooding in the county - especially on the Somerset Levels.

The
 Met Office said that rain across Britain would be accompanied by strong
 winds, and rainfall accumulations of up to 0.8in were expected.

Meanwhile,
 witnesses said a ‘mini-tornado’ swept through Surrey and Sussex, 
bringing down trees, damaging homes and even lifting cats in the air.

It
 reportedly hit Chobham, Surrey, at 5pm yesterday. Local resident 
Shirley Blay said: ‘It was a mini-tornado, I can't describe it as 
anything less.'

She told BBC News:
 ‘We've got four feral cats in the yard and they were being lifted off 
the ground - they just went round like a big paper bag.’

 Power Networks said some 13,000 customers were left without power in 
Kent, Sussex and Surrey on Saturday night, but this has since fallen to 
1,100.

Many
 Somerset communities are still coming to terms with the flooding that 
hit the county at the beginning of January and now face more woe.

Somerset County Council deputy chief executive Pat Flaherty said: ‘Our priority has to be to keep people safe.

‘We
 are doing everything we can to do this and we believe that declaring a 
major incident shows just how urgent the situation is for many of our 
residents and communities.

‘The reason we are taking this action 
is the long-term nature of the issues we are facing and to enable a 
consistent approach to the way that we deal with them.’

The
 council will continue its help for people affected by flooding, which 
includes a boat service for the cut-off community of Muchelney and 
Thorney.

It is also 
providing a pontoon bridge at Langport, supporting farmers providing a 
tractor service and evacuating residents when necessary.

A
 Met Office forecaster said: ‘More heavy rain will spread east across 
the area on Sunday.

'Given the current disruption on the Somerset Levels,
 the public should be prepared for further flooding.’

The
 Environment Agency said that communities across southern England should
 again prepare for possible flooding as the Met Office forecasts further
 heavy rain for tomorrow through to Tuesday.

Two walkers were recovering from burned feet today after being hit by lightning near the summit of a mountain in Wales.

They rang 999 after the scare close to the near-3,000ft top of Aran Fawddwy, a peak in south Snowdonia between Bala and Dolgellau.

The men, friends aged 58 and 37 from Buckinghamshire, had their feet burned and socks singed in the frightening episode.

Members of a mountain rescue team were joined by an RAF helicopter based at Valley in Anglesey, whose winchman Sgt Dave Currie was lowered on to the mountain. Then, with team members, he managed to reach the pair.

One was carried down to below the cloud level, and the other was able to walk. Then they were winched into the Sea King and flown to hospital at Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor.

Sgt Currie said: ‘The men thought the lightning had struck a couple of feet from them.

'They took their walking boots off, their socks had been burned and they had blisters and burns on their feet. It was frightening for them but they were very lucky.'

A
 spokesman said: ‘With the ground already saturated, rivers and 
groundwater levels remain very responsive to rainfall, particularly on 
the Somerset Levels.

‘Environment Agency teams 
continue to operate up to 62 pumps 24 hours a day to drain an estimated 
65million cubic metres (2.3billion cubic ft) of floodwater off an area 
of the Levels spanning 65 sq km (25 sq miles).’

Yesterday, strong winds caused damage to houses and forced residents to be evacuated from a street in a Warwickshire town.

Bricks and roof tiles were dislodged from houses on Hickman Road in Nuneaton, as high winds hit the area.

Many
 people dialled 999 as the storm swept through the street but nobody was
 hurt, Warwickshire Police said. Several residents were given shelter in
 the local community hall.

A force spokesman said two of 
the houses on Hickman Road were badly affected with extensive damage to 
the roofs, three further properties have significant damage, and others 
have had roof tiles blown off.

Fire, police and ambulance services were sent to assess the damage and check for casualties.

Superintendent Martin Samuel of Warwickshire Police, said, ‘Thankfully, despite our initial fears, no-one was injured as a result of the damage to the properties.

‘The community hall at nearby St Peter's Church was made available for people to go to while structural engineers from Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough Council carried out safety assessments on the houses that had been damaged.’

Some residents were not expected to be able to return to their homes last night.

A spokesman for Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough Council said: ‘We are currently working to clear the debris in the area.

‘We will also have officers from the council at St Peter's Church Hall on Sunday morning between 10am and 11.30am to offer further advice, help and support to anyone affected by the storm damage.’

Elsewhere in the county the emergency services and the highways agency have been working with local councils to deal with a number of other storm related incidents including trees which had been brought down by the strong winds, and flooded roads as a result of the heavy rain.
