Michael Grimm, a Republican who has represented New Yorkers in Congress since 2011, plans to enter a guilty plea Tuesday in federal court, admitting that he helped prepare a fraudulent tax return for a restaurant he partially owned.

The federal felony could bring him up to three years in prison, but a person who is familiar with the congressman's negotiations told DailyMail.com on Monday that the congressman doesn't expect to go to prison. 

Grimm is a former FBI agent and is a rare Republican in the Democrat-friendly Big Apple.

His fate will be up to Federal Judge Pamela Chen, however, when she hears the terms of a plea agreement. Grimm was originally charged with 20 separate federal crimes and has been serving his constituents while under the terms of a $400,000 bond granted in the spring. 

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS AND THE CRIMINAL INDICTMENT 

ON HIS WAY OUT? New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm is expected to plead guilty on Tuesday to a federal tax felony

Grimm maintained his innocence throughout the 2014 congressional campaign season but will cop to a crime now that he's won re-election

Loretta Lynch, the sitting U.S. Attorney in Brooklyn, N.Y., brought the indictment against Grimm this year making him the first federal lawmaker to face criminal charges since 2008.

Lynch later became President Barack Obama choice to succeed Eric Holder as U.S. attorney general.

By pleading guilty to a single tax charge, he will avoid a trial that was scheduled to convene in January. Jurors would heave heard details of Grimm's alleged scheme to hide more than $1 million of his restaurant's sales and wages in order to dodge taxes between 2008 and 2010.

He was also accused of hiring illegal immigrants to work for him.

The plea hearing is scheduled for 1:00 p.m. Tuesday in a Brooklyn federal courtroom. 

Neither prosecutors nor Grimm's attorney has commented for the record. 

The person who spoke to DailyMail.com, and two others who talked to the Associated Press, said Grimm will enter a guilty plea on a single count of 'aiding and assisting in the preparation and filing of a false or fraudulent tax return.' 

The Staten Island Republican easily won re-election in November despite campaigning under a cloud of suspicion for nearly five months.

He beat Democrat Domenic Recchia by a 55-42 per cent margin to win a third term in office.

If Grimm avoids a prison sentence, the shoulder-chipped GOPer is expected to argue that he should remain in office during a period of probation.

That decision, however, will depend on the leanings of his fellow House Republicans, who hold a sizable majority and could vote to expel him.

The House Ethics Committee has let its own investigation idle while the wheels of justice turn. But if he admits to a crime on Tuesday, the committee could quickly move to throw him out of Congress.

House Speaker John Boehner's office kept mum on Monday, declining to speculate to DailyMail.com about Grimm's prospects to keep his job.

Grimm owned a 45-percent interest in 'Granny Sayz,' a company that did business as Healthalicious, a Manhattan health food restaurant.

Lynch's indictment accused him of helping the company avoid paying taxes on more than $1 million in income, and using cash to underpay workers under the table. 

Some of those employees were allegedly illegal immigrants and earned less than the minimum wage.

The government alleged that Grimm kept two separate payroll ledgers, one of which was fictitious, allowing him to skirt income taxes, payroll taxes and workers' compensation costs.

When some of the employees sued the company for back wages, Grimm was deposed under oath. Prosecutors claim he testified, falsely, that he had never paid the restaurant's workers in cash.

In January, Grimm became a household name when a New York City journalist caught him on video threatening to throw him off a U.S. Capitol balcony for asking him a tough question about an unrelated federal probe into his 2010 campaign finances.

Grimm posted a $400,000 bond to remain free while tax fraud charges pended against him in a case revolving around alleged illegal cash payments he made to illegal-immigrant restaurant employees in order to avoid paying taxes

Grimm went ballistic when NY1 reporter Michael Scotto strayed away from the approved interview topics after President Obama's State of the union Speech on January 28.

The congressman waled out of range of the camera suddenly when the topic came up, saying he didn't want to speak 'off-topic.'

Michael Scotto, a video journalist for the NY1 television station, was on the receiving end of a Grimm threat in January at the US Capitol

Grimm 'does not want to talk about some of the allegations concerning his campaign finances,' Scotto said, closing his televised segment.

But the camera kept rolling as the congressman barked.

'Let me be clear to you,' he said. 'You ever do that to me again I’ll throw you off this f***ing balcony.'

'Why? It’s a valid question,' Scotto responded.

'No, no, you’re not man enough, you’re not man enough,' Grimm sniped back.

'I’ll break you in half. Like a boy.'

Grimm apologized the following day.

His long-time girlfriend, Diana Durand, pleaded guilty in September to illegally funneling money to his campaign by paying 'straw donors' to make the contributions.

In some cases she reimbursed them after the fact. 

The scheme obscured where the donated money originally came from and allowed Grimm to reap more of Durand's campaign cash than the law allowed.

Conservative filmmaker Dinesh D-Souza pleaded guilty to the same crime in May. He paid his friends back for their donations to college friend Wendy Long's failed U.S. senate campaign.
