Barcelona defender Marc Bartra has expressed his shock at his team-mate Luis Suarez being omitted from the 23-man Ballon d'Or shortlist.

Suarez, who scored 31 goals in 33 appearances for Liverpool in the Premier League last season, appears to have paid the price for his bite on Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup, but Bartra feels despite that he should have made the cut.

He told beIN Sports: 'I'm surprised. I think he had a spectacular year. He's a great player, he is one of the best strikers in the world and I think he deserves to be there [on the shortlist].'

Suarez impressed on his debut for the Catalan giants, making an instant impact as he set up his side's first goal against arch-rivals Real Madrid, with Neymar the grateful receiver.

Unfortunately for Suarez and Barcelona that was as good as it got, as they fell to a 3-1 defeat at the Bernabeu.

Luis Enrique's side will look to bounce back from that defeat when they entertain Celta Vigo on Saturday evening.
