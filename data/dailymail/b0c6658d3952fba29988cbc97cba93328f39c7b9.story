It only took a few hours for a bipartisan congressional push against Iran's nuclear ambitions to become Oval Office roadkill on Thursday, as the White House insisted that President Barack Obama will veto any effort to introduce new sanctions on the Islamic republic while the State Department works its diplomatic levers.

A group of 13 Democrats and 13 Republicans in the U.S. Senate introduced a bill that would levy tough new penalties on Iran if it fails to prove by May that it has terminated its nuclear weapons program.

But in his afternoon press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Obama would have no patience with congressional efforts to put pressure on Iranian President Hassan Rouhani during a period of negotiation designed to bring his country's nuclear program out in the open.

'We don't think this action is necessary,' Carney told reporters. 'We donâ€™t think it will be enacted. If it were enacted, the president would veto it.'

Restless: Congress is growing wary of Iran's nuclear disarmament promises, and now 26 senators are calling for new threats of sanctions if President Hassan Rouhani doesn't follow through

Trouble ahead: The Emergency Committee for Israel lashed out at President Obama for threatening a veto of new legislation that would all but guarantee U.S. support of Tel Aviv's military strikes on Tehran

Denied: White House Press Secretary Jay Carney left little doubt that Obama would veto the Senate bill, saying the threat of new sanctions could being Iran closer to war footing

The president's chief spokesman echoed other 
administration officials' complaints that threats of a new round of 
sanctions could drive Iran away from the bargaining table and perhaps 
put the nation on war footing with the U.S. and Israel.

The Senate bill would 'greatly increase the chances that the United States would have to take military action' against Iran, he claimed. 'It would potentially divide the international community and obviously would suggest bad faith on the part of the United States.'

But that view doesn't square with more than one-quarter of the Senate. Foreign Relations Chairman Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, and Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican, introduced the Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act of 2013 earlier in the day, along with 24 other co-sponsors.

'Current sanctions brought Iran to the negotiating table,' Menendez said Thursday, 'and a credible threat of future sanctions will require Iran to cooperate and act in good faith.'

'The burden rests with Iran to negotiate in good faith and verifiably terminate its nuclear weapons program,' he said.

Kirk called the legislation 'a responsible, bipartisan bill to protect the American people from Iranian deception.'

'The American people rightfully distrust Iran's true intentions,' he added, 'and they deserve an insurance policy to defend against Iranian deception.'

Maverick, Jr.: Sen. Bob Menendez is getting a reputation for bucking his own party, most recently with a bill designed to force President Obama's hand during tense negotiations with Iran

It's unclear whether Majority Leader Harry Reid will advance the bill to the Senate floor for a vote, even if it gains momentum and a host of new co-sponsors.

Believable? Rouhani has publicly pledged to open up his uranium enrichment sites to inspectors and slow production, while privately telling his countrymen that it will be business as usual in Iran's nuclear program

But with more than a dozen Democrats 
in direct conflict with the White House's policy on Iran, the stage has 
been set for a Washington, D.C. conflict that the Iranians will likely 
watch unfold on CNN.

One aide to a senator who co-sponsored the bill told Politico that the White 's concerns about new hostilities between Iran and the west is 'a false choice.'

'The supporters of the bill believe it makes war less likely,' the staffer said: 'Sanctions brought us this far, and the threat of additional sanctions can help us force Iran to get rid of their nuclear weapons in the negotiations.'

The Senate bill would forbid the Obama administration from waiving any congressionally approved sanctions unless the U.S. and its allies have 'reached a final and verifiable agreement or arrangement with Iran that will ... dismantle Iran's illicit nuclear infrastructure, including enrichment and reprocessing capabilities and facilities.'

Congress could also block sanctions waivers, according to an analysis by Foreign Policy magazine, 'by passing a "joint resolution of disapproval" against a final deal.'

The legislation also features a a non-binding promise that if Israel were to take 'military action in legitimate self-defense against Iran's nuclear weapons program,' the U.S. 'should stand with Israel and provide... diplomatic, military, and economic support to the Government of Israel in its defense of its territory, people, and existence.'

Hot seat: Secretary of State John Kerry has to continue overseeing negotiations while the Senate committee he once chaired wrangles internally over whether to add more fuel to his fire

The White House's veto threat is already hitting home with Israel's supporters in Washington.

The Emergency Committee for Israel quickly labeled the Senate effort 'carefully considered legislation intended to prevent a nuclear Iran.'

'The Obama administration immediately threatened to veto the legislation,' the group said in a statement, 'and falsely accuses its sponsors of engaging in a rush to war. In fact the White House has responded in far harsher terms to these members of Congress than it has to an Iranian regime which continues to enrich uranium, prevent monitoring of its nuclear program, and still refuses to implement the Geneva agreement negotiated last month.'

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif told Time magazine this month that new sanctions, including penalties slated to take effect after November's six-month interim agreement expires, would eliminate the chance for a more comprehensive nuclear bargain.
