A woman who had recently been diagnosed with cancer was sacked by her employers just hours after doctors informed them she would need time off for treatment.

Elisa Madonia, 63, who has worked for the last four years at S37, a property management company in Mount Prospect, Illinois, is suing her former employer after claiming she lost her job when they received a letter detailing her need for chemotherapy, radiation treatment and surgery.

Ms Madonia, who was told in October that she had stage three oesophageal cancer, alleges that less than two hours after receiving the letter, she was called into her boss' office.

It was suggested that she resign, with her employer offering to pay six months of COBRA medical insurance it she signed a separation letter.

Then her contract was ended.

Madonia, who after months of treatment also had surgery a fortnight ago, told CBS 2: 'I've been fighting for my life. Not only Iâ€™m being hit with a disease, that I have cancer, now you take my job too away from me?'

Meanwhile, her caregiver, Kathleen Derosa, described it as 'the cruellest thing' she has heard.

Derosa said: 'For the worst possible moment of her life, being diagnosed with stage three oesophageal cancer, that was just the cruellest thing I ever heard.'

Attorney Eugene Hollander called S37's decision 'illegal' and a 'knee jerk reaction'.

'I think they had an obligation to sit down with Elise and say, hey, what can we do here?'

Madonia has laid out her allegations in a disability discrimination lawsuit.

S37â€²s attorney Brian Garelli said he was unable to comment, as he had not seen the lawsuit.
