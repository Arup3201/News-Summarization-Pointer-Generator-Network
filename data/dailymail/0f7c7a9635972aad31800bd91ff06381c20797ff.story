Billions of people across the world will be focused on the Queen today as she celebrates her Diamond Jubilee with a majestic 1,000-strong river pageant.

As the star of today's spectacular, the Queen made sure to live up to the expectations of her loyal subjects and fans as she stepped on to the Britannia launch today to take her to the royal barge wearing a stunning silver and white coat and hat trimmed with dozens of Swarovski crystals.

The Queen's resplendent outfit has been a year in the planning and was designed by her Majesty's long-serving in-house couturier, Angela Kelly. 

The coat, its matching dress and the hat were made by Angela Kelly's small in-house Buckingham Palace team.

The colour scheme was chosen to stand
 out against the red, gold and purple hues of the royal barge, The 
Spirit of Chartwell, on which the Queen will enjoy an hour and a half 
long voyage today.

The
 outfit, created from white bouclé and threaded throughout with silk 
ribbon, is embroidered with gold, silver and ivory 
paillettes and embellished with Swarovski crystals to reflect the 
sparkling water of the River Thames. The neckline of the outfit is finished with a silk 
organza frill which also runs the length of the garment.

The 
Queen's hat featured a sculptural brim with a sweeping upward curve, 
echoing the waves of the water, with the crown of the hat  made of the same
 material as the coat. Details on the beautiful headpiece include feathers han- dyed in
 Buckingham Palace by one of Miss Kelly's team, a sprinkling of yet more 
crystals and swathes of pleated ivory organza.

The Queen joined her family on board the lavishly decorated Spirit of Chartwell after a short journey on board the Britannia Launch to reach the spot where the royal barge was moored.

Pageant Master Adrian Evans, the man who has organised much of the event, greeted the royals in turn as they arrived on the upper deck.

Plush red velvet seats with a canopy were in place for the royal party to use.

The first squadron of the flotilla, made up of boats powered by oars or paddles, sped past the royal barge to take up their place ahead of the royal squadron followed by boats carrying flags of all the Commonwealth nations.

Majestic:
 The 1,000-strong flotilla started its journey at Battersea bridge and 
will draw to a close at Tower Bridge, where the Royals will have 
disembarked to watch the grand finale

Leading the flotilla was a floating belfry sounding a peal of its eight bells, which will be answered by bell towers along the route.

In its wake, the man-powered boats led by royal row barge the Gloriana,
 with Sirs Steve Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent leading the oarsmen, the 
Diamond Jubilee river pageant began its majestic journey down the 
Thames just after 2pm today.

Each has been named after a senior member of the Royal Family with the tenor - the largest - christened Elizabeth and the smallest - the treble - called Henry.

The rowed vessels saluted the Queen by tossing oars - raising their oars in the air - as they passed.

The 1,000 crafts set off at a steady rate of four knots in wave after wave of tugs, steamers, pleasure cruisers, dragon boats and kayaks with the Queen travelling at its heart.

Glittering: The outfit was bedecked with dozens of crystals, the hat with sliver, gold and white paillettes. On her lapel she had pinned a star-shaped diamond brooch

Fit for a Queen: The Queen's pageant outfit, 
designed by Angela Kelly, was an ivory dress and coat in white boucle 
threaded throughout with silk ribbon and decorated with crystals

Hats off to her! The Queen's hat was decorated with feathers and crystals
