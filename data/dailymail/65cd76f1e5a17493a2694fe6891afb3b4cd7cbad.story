A teenager has died after falling from a rollercoaster called Hell at a theme park in Benidorm.

The 18-year-old, from Iceland, is believed to have been flung from the ride at the Terra Mitica theme park after his harness failed, suffering horrific injuries including multiple fractures and head wounds.

He is said to have suffered the fatal accident while he was on holiday with his parents and a friend.

Spanish police today confirmed the teenager is from Iceland. The 18-year-old was originally reported to have been British.

But a police spokesman confirmed this morning: 'He is from Iceland and not Britain as some reports have said.'

The rollercoaster where the accident happened is called Inferno - Catalan for ‘Hell’.

It does 360 degree turns and produces 3g forces at speeds of more than 40mph.

A judicial source confirmed a court in Benidorm had opened an investigation.

The source said: 'Benidorm court number two has opened an investigation following the death of a person involved in an accident at a ride in Terra Mitica theme park.

'The judge is awaiting a police report after which he will decide what action to take.

'We don’t have any more information at this stage.'

The incident happened around 4.30pm yesterday afternoon.

The teenager is understood to have been with his father, his brother and a friend when it happened.

He was alive when paramedics arrived but died inside the ambulance after suffering heart arrest around 5.30pm.

Terra Mitica, which translates literally as ‘Mythical Land’ in English, was opened in 2000 and the rollercoaster at the centre of the tragedy was opened in July 2007.

It is in the Egypt zone, one of the five themed zones of the theme park, which is influenced by ancient Egyptian culture.

No-one from the theme park, which has been operating independently since emerging from temporary receivership in 2006, has yet made any public comment.
