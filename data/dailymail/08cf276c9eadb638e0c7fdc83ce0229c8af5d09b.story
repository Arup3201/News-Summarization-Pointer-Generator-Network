Three members of the same family who died in a static caravan from carbon monoxide poisoning would have been unconscious 'within minutes', investigators said today.

The bodies of married couple John and Audrey Cook were discovered alongside their daughter, Maureen, at the mobile home they shared on Tremarle Home Park in Camborne, west Cornwall.

The inquests have now opened into the deaths last Saturday, with investigators saying the three died along with the family's pet dog, of carbon monoxide poisoning from a cooker.

It is also believed there was no working carbon monoxide detector in the static caravan. Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service said this would have resulted in the three being unconscious 'within minutes',

A spokesman for Cornwall coroner Dr Emma Carlyon confirmed the inquests were opened and adjourned yesterday afternoon. They will resume at a later date.

Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed on Monday that carbon monoxide poisoning had been established as the cause of death.

A police spokesman said the source of the poisoning was 'believed to be from incorrect operation of the gas cooker'.

Touching: This tribute was left outside the caravan following news of the deaths

Early readings from experts at the site revealed a potentially lethal level of carbon monoxide present within the caravan at the time it was taken, shortly after the discovery of the bodies.

Friends and neighbours have paid tribute to the trio.

One
neighbour, Sonya Owen, 53, said: 'It's very distressing. I knew the 
daughter, she was living her with her mum and dad. Everybody is really 
upset.'

Margaret Holmes, 65, who lived near the couple and their 
daughter, said: 'They had lived here for around 40 years and they kept 
themselves to themselves.

'I just can’t believe this has 
happened, it is so sad and I am so shocked, I think we all are, you just
don’t expect this sort of thing to happen on your doorstep.

'Everyone will miss them, we used to chat a lot when we were both in the garden.

'I would just like to send my condolences to their family, I can’t imagine what they’re going through.'

Nic Clark, 52, who was good friends with daughter Maureen, added: 'They were a lovely kind family, a great trio.

'Maureen
used to go out and walk her dog, a little Jack Russell, it is so sad 
what has happened, I understand the dog went with them.

'They 
will be sorely missed and I think everyone is just in shock at the 
moment, I would like to send my condolences to the Cook family.'
