Galatasaray midfielder Blerim Dzemaili has told his team-mates they have nothing to fear when they face Arsenal in the Champions League on Wednesday night.

The Switzerland international moved to the Turkish club in the summer from Napoli, where he was part of the team which beat Arsenal 2-0 in last season's competition.

And he is confident that Galatasaray will be able to come to the Emirates and take the game to their opponents.

'They are a team that plays very good football from behind,' Dzemaili said, recalling the last time he faced them. 'They try to play the ball always. I remember one thing about them they're a team they go together, everybody gives everything for the team.

'For us it will be important to get out as a team, to defend strong and to play our game. Don't be afraid. We have to have respect, that's important, but not to be afraid. I think we have a good team, we can play against every team. I think it's going to be in our hands.'

Galatasaray won the Emirates Cup in 2013, beating Arsenal 2-1 in the final after Didier Drogba scored twice.

Asked if that would give the side an advantage, Galatasaray manager Cesare Prandelli replied: 'All these experiences psychologically boost morale up. It can bring an advantage, we believe we have to be brave. I believe we don't know what we can do, we can actually improve from today onwards.'
