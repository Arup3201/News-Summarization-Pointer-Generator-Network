They’d never met him and they knew precious little about him.

But hundreds turned out yesterday to mark the passing of a former Royal Marine who died with no known family . . . or friends.

Some travelled hundreds of miles to the funeral of James McConnell in Portsmouth after a local vicar used Facebook to appeal for mourners.

Hero: Former Royal Marine James 'Jimmy' McConnell, of Southsea, Hampshire, died last month aged 70

In remembrance: A motorcycle procession took place at the funeral of former Royal Marine James McConnell

Mark of respect: A small procession through the cemetery for Mr McConnell, who died of a chest infection, was led by Royal British Legion standard bearers

Reverend Bob Mason had felt troubled that just a handful of people would be at the ceremony – all of them care home staff who looked after Mr McConnell before his death aged 69 last month.

He posted a message on Facebook  and contacted the Royal Marines  Association asking for help to give the former bus driver – known as Jimmy – a ‘better send-off’. After a rallying cry went around the Armed Forces and social networking sites his wish for the former serviceman was granted.

Yesterday, in the biting cold, a procession through the cemetery was led by Royal British Legion standard bearers  followed by a group of flag-bearing motorcycles from the legion’s riders’ branch.

Two buglers from the Royal Marines band played the Last Post as Mr McConnell’s coffin was lowered into the ground.And mourners surrounded the grave with poppy wreaths – one with the poignant, handwritten message: ‘Stand at ease, your work is done.’

Mr Mason, who conducted the service at Milton Cemetery, told the estimated 300 who attended: ‘The great majority of you who have come here today did not know James McConnell but wanted him to have a dignified farewell.

‘I thank you for that kindness and generosity of spirit.’ After the ceremony he said: ‘It was a very cold morning, and people were shivering, but it is testament to the sacrifice people were prepared to make in order to attend.’

Richie Puttock, from the Royal Marines
Association, travelled 140 miles from his home in Cardiff to bid 
farewell to the man he had never met. He said: ‘I had to ensure he got 
the send-off he deserved. It was an absolutely fantastic service. I 
think his story pricked the conscience of those who heard it, because 
nobody wants to think they will have a funeral with nobody there. 
Wherever he is now, I’m sure he would have been pleased.’

'The
great majority of you who have come here today did not know James 
McConnell but wanted him to have a dignified farewell. I thank you for 
that kindness'

Danny Marshall, a former Royal Marine,
said he attended because the corps was like an extended family. He 
said: ‘It was mentioned wrongly that he did not have family; the corps 
family is bigger and better than most people would know about. We are 
all family and always will be.’

Mr McConnell, who died from a chest 
infection, spent his final days at the Bluebell Care Home in Southsea. 
Little is known about his life or about his career in the Armed Forces.

He was referred to the care home by 
social services and arrived with his green beret, medals, and 
photographs of the Falklands. Mr McConnell had been forced to leave his 
flat, where he had lived alone, two months before his death after 
suffering a stroke which affected his ability to speak.

Finish: The service concluded with two buglers from the Royal Marines Band Service playing the Last Post

Tribute: Mourners at the funeral included tearful veterans, members of the military, and the local community, who surrounded the grave with military standards, and poppy wreaths

Dizzy Page, the activities co-ordinator at the care home, described him as ‘a proud man’ who ‘always had a sparkle in his eyes’.

Ian Smith, one of the directors of the
care home, said: ‘It was amazing to see close to 300 people turn up to 
the funeral. It makes you proud to be British.

‘People in the Armed Forces go through
big events during their lifetimes and deserve a good send-off. It was a
privilege to have him at our home.’
