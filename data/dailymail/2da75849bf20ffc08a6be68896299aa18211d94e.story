The Texas National Guard has refused to process requests from same-sex couples
for benefits on Tuesday despite a Pentagon directive to do so, while
Mississippi won't issue applications from state-owned offices. Both states
have cited their respective bans on gay marriage.

Tuesday was the first working day that gays in the military could apply for
benefits after the Pentagon announced it would recognize same-sex marriages.

The Department of Defense had announced that it would recognize same-sex
marriages performed in states where they are legal following the U.S. Supreme
Court decision that threw out parts of the Defense of Marriage Act.

Victory: Crowds celebrate in June after The Supreme Court ruled that same-sex marriages should be legally recognized as valid across the U.S., but now the Texas National Guard has refused to process requests from same-sex couples for benefits

Texas and Mississippi appear to be the only two states limiting how and
where same-sex spouses of National Guard members can register for
identification cards and benefits, according to an Associated Press tally.

Officials in 13 other states that also ban gay marriage - including Arizona,
Oklahoma, Florida, Michigan and Georgia - said on Tuesday that they will follow
federal law and process all couples applying for benefits the same.

Major General John Nichols, the commanding general of Texas Military Forces,
wrote to service members in a letter obtained by the AP that because the Texas
Constitution defines marriage as between a man and a woman, his state agency
couldn't process applications from gay and lesbian couples.

But he said the
Texas National Guard, Texas Air Guard and Texas State Guard would not deny
anyone benefits.

A spokesman for Texas Gov. Rick Perry said the Texas Military Forces, as a state agency, must obey state law and refuse to recognize same-sex couple

Nichols wrote that his agency, which oversees Texas' National Guard units, ‘remains
committed to ensuring its military personnel and their families receive the
benefits to which they are entitled. As such, we encourage anyone affected by
this issue to enroll for benefits at a federal installation.’

He then listed 22
bases operated by the Department of Defense in Texas where service members
could enroll their families.

A spokesman for Texas Gov. Rick Perry said the Texas Military Forces, as a
state agency, must obey state law.

Mississippi National Guard spokesman Tim Powell said the main factor in
determining where same-sex spouses could apply for benefits came down to the
property owner.

Powell said only National Guard offices on federal property
would accept the applications in Mississippi, which also constitutionally bans
gay marriage.

‘It is our intent to provide benefits and services to our men and women in
uniform and at the same time abide by federal and state statutes,’ Powell said.

Pentagon officials said Texas appeared to be the only state with a total ban
on processing applications from gay and lesbian couples.

Spokesman Lt. Cmdr.
Nate Christensen said federal officials will process all applications from
same-sex couples with a marriage certificate from a state where it is legal.

Alicia Butler said she was turned away from the Texas Military Forces
headquarters in Austin early Tuesday and advised to get her ID card at Fort
Hood, an Army post 90 miles away.

She married her spouse - an Iraq war veteran -
in California in 2009, and they have a five-month-old child.

‘It's so petty. It's not like it's going to stop us from registering or stop
us from marrying. It's a pointed way of saying, “We don't like you,”’ Butler
said.

She said she was concerned the state would withhold survivor benefits if
something happened to her wife while she was activated on state duty rather
than on federal deployment.

Alicia Butler, right, who married spouse Judith Chedville, left, in 2009 described the move by the Texas National Guard as petty

‘People say, “Why don't you live somewhere else?'" she said.

‘Well, my ancestors came here five generations ago to get away from this
kind of stuff, and this is my state and I'm not going to go away.’

The American Military Partner Association, which advocates for lesbian, bisexual, gay and transgender people in the armed forces, gave the AP a copy of Nichols' letter.

'It's truly outrageous that the State of Texas has decided to play politics with our military families,' said Stephen Peters, the organization's president.

'Our military families are already dealing with enough problems and the last thing they need is more discrimination from the state of Texas.'

In Florida, where gay marriage is banned, state Department of Military Affairs spokesman Lt. Col. James Evans said he was unaware of any policy that would prohibit accepting a request for processing benefits.

So far, only one National Guard soldier has inquired about receiving benefits for her same-sex partner, but she didn't have a valid marriage license from a states that authorizes same-sex marriages, Moss said.

'As long as the soldier presents that marriage certificate or license, then we would treat that claim just like we would any other soldier that brings in a marriage license or certificate,' Moss said.
