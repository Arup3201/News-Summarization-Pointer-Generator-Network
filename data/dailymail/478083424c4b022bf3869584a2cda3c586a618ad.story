A  finance manager stole more than £240,000 to fund her lavish lifestyle - increasing her own salary 135 times and even using a company credit card to pay a £400 vet's bill for her dog Max.

Liza Starling, 45, was trusted as a model employee at family-run corporate tailors Stuncroft Ltd of Bury St Edmunds from 2005 to 2012.

Its 36 employees had no idea she was secretly giving herself £4,000 bonuses, taking £11,500 loans she had no intention of repaying and clearing her £6,090 credit card bills.

Starling had a company Mazda, company credit card, and regularly took flights to Belgium to oversee its operation there.

But secretly she was stealing cash to spend on holidays to France, a designer kitchen, a new bathroom, new carpets and an extension on her £200,000 home in Wickham Market. She spent so much rebuilding walls in the Georgian house she described it as her 'money pit'.

Her salary was £23,000 when she started with Stuncroft as the firm grew to 30 employees in Bury St Edmunds and 34 in Goole with a division in Belgium.

She took on extra responsibility and claimed her salary ballooned to £75,000 when it should have been only £30,000 with yearly increases.

No one knew she was stealing from 2005 to 2012 until she left and a new finance director found a black hole in the company accounts.

However, today a jury at Hull Crown Court convicted her of three charges of theft totalling £241,000. 

The firm suffered financially and had to close its Bury St Edmonds site in 2012.

Jailing her for four years Judge Mark Bury said: 'You have been convicted on overwhelming evidence of the systematic theft of more than £240,000.

'That theft started out with fairly modest sums to see what you could get away with and increased substantially.

'Your offending was motivated by greed and the desire to live beyond your means. You breached the high level of trust given to you by your employer.

'Over the years you stole significant amounts of money to pay yourself extra wages. One of the aggravating features is you sought to blame loyal members of staff, including the former finance director John Grundy saying that he allowed you to borrow £40,000 over four years.

'Mr Grundy is now dead and cannot defend his good character, but you knew that in your police interview. I have watched you give evidence.

'You have shown no remorse. Your arrogance was breath-taking. You tried to hoodwink the jury, but the saw through your obvious dishonest actions.'

The jury found her guilty of three charges of theft after a six-day trial. Her husband of 24 years has supported her in the public gallery and gave her one last hug before she was taken away.

Defence barrister David Gordon said: 'She has spent her first night in prison and found it shocking. It will have a detrimental effect on her and her husband.

'She suffers from fibromyalgia which leads to joint pain as well as high cholesterol which won’t make her stay in prison any easier.

'For all her offending she has nothing to show for it. The house she took in Suffolk was sold for £155,000 and of the £70,000 equity very little remains because of the debts she paid off. She described is as a project but it became a bottomless pit. 

'She is now living in rented accommodation. No one has suggested her husband was involved. It was a shock to him as it will be to the rest of her family.

'Her parents are in their 70s and they have been kept in the dark. Her husband has the unenviable job of telling them about the court case today and one hopes it won’t have too detrimental an effect on their physical and emotional health.'

Stuncroft is a corporate clothing supplier and was founded by tailor Brian Long who died in 2008.

Starling sought to hide behind his death and that of John Grundy, the finance director, in her efforts to explain why she was receiving thousands of pounds through the company which was not in her contract of employment.

Starling, of Gainsborough, accepted in police interview she regularly ran out of money 'because her Suffolk house was falling down' and asked Mr Grundy for a loan who said 'of course, pay yourself the money.'

She said she discussed a loan of £40,000 which she took in instalments of up to £11,500 a time in 2008. But money was never paid back.

To hide her tracks from auditors she used false codes in the bookkeeping system. In one example she made it look like a payment to clothing outworkers in Bangalore, India.

In another case she paid herself £3,875-a-month mirroring a director’s company pension payment so it was overlooked or thought to be an error.

She claimed in January 2008 she was given a pay rise to £75,000, but there was no supporting letter or email. In December 2011 she gave herself an additional £4,000 Christmas bonus.

But her world came tumbling down in June 2012 when she handed in her notice to managing director Douglas Bailey claiming she was stressed and could not work for him.

New finance manager Elizabeth Hay took over and  was unable to make the books balance.

She contacted the bank for breakdowns for the mysterious payments, finding each time money was paid to Liza Starling. It was the tip of a financial iceberg.

Starling did not pay the necessary Inland Revenue tax on her thefts. She had the audacity to make a further five separate thefts after she handed in her notice, coding her final additional payment as 'finished goods' to hide it from auditors.

Humberside Police are to launch a separate Proceeds of Crime Act Investigation in an effort to claw back her ill-gotten gains. Judge Bury said he did not believe all her assets had gone.

Speaking after the hearing Stuncroft managing director David Bailey said: 'I have 36 hard-working employees in Goole and I gathered them together last night to tell them.

'The staff were all shocked. I sat through the court case and was saddened by what I heard. Liza Starling worked hard, but she stole a lot of money and justice has now been done.

'This all happened before I became managing director and was discovered a year ago and in many ways the company is in a different place now to what it was.

'My main priority is to look after the 36 people we have working for us and our customers and move on.

'We are not flying, but we are in a healthy position and that is down to the hard-work of the staff. We have many of them women in their 50s and 60s who let’s be honest are not paid highly but we are proud to work with.'
