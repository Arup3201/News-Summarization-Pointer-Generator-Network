The passport photo of 'Hana Gaddafi' who was 'killed' 25 years ago

For a quarter of a century, Colonel Gaddafi claimed that his adopted baby daughter Hana was killed in a U.S. airstrike.

The dictator even set up a shrine to the six-month-old infant in his Tripoli compound, with replica American missiles and furniture preserved behind glass screens.

Yesterday, however, it appeared that it was all a ruse to whip up hatred against the West and win sympathy from ordinary Libyans.

Documents and photographs found in the compound suggest that far from perishing in the 1986 attack, Hana is alive – and working as a doctor.

She studied medicine in Tripoli and four years ago took English classes at the British Council in the Libyan capital, for which she received an A grade.

An examination paper from a Libyan medical facility was written in Arabic and signed ‘Hana Muammar Gaddafi’.

There was a passport photograph of a young woman thought to be Hana, along with pictures of her with Gaddafi’s blood daughter Aisha.

Colonel Gaddafi created a shrine in honour of Hana in the heavily-fortified base after she 'died' when she was just a few months old

One room in the compound appeared to 
have been occupied by Hana, complete with Sex and the City DVD box set, 
pop CDs featuring the Backstreet Boys and even cellulite treatments.

On shelves which contained medical textbooks there were also photographs of a woman in her mid 20s wearing medical clothing.

Earlier this year the German newspaper Die Welt reported that Hana was a doctor who worked for the country’s health ministry.

The paper told how she was a powerful 
figure within the Libyan medical profession – and had even used her 
status to block the careers and promotions of colleagues.

It added that 
‘several hospitals were under her guidance’. She spoke fluent English 
and regularly travelled to London on shopping trips.

Colonel Gaddafi had claimed his adopted daughter died in the 1986 bombing

The 1986 airstrike, ordered by 
President Ronald Reagan, was in retaliation for a Berlin nightclub 
bombing by Libyan agents in which two U.S. soldiers died.

Twenty years after Hana's 'death' the regime organised a 'Hana Festival of Freedom and Peace' in her honour.

When the family's assets were frozen in Switzerland in February as rebel uprisings began, Hana was listed in documents as one of 23 members of the Gaddafi family.

Her date of birth was given as November 11, 1985, making her 25 if she is still alive.

Earlier this month, files found in Knightsbridge revealed a dentist travelled to Libya to treat a 'Hana Gaddafi' in 2008.

The dentist refused to discuss it.
