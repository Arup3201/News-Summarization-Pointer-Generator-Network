A rock used by a Spanish farmer for more than 30 years to press ham has turned out to be an iron meteorite worth at least Â£3.5million.

Faustino Asensio Lopez found the 100kg rock, which measures just 45x31x20cm, as he was tending to livestock with his father in a field near Ciudad Real in 1980.

Believing it to be military scrap from the country's civil war, it sat on his patio for more than three decades - its weight used by family members to cure meat.

It was only in 2011 when Lopez saw a 
TV report on meteorite sightings over Spain that he got in touch with 
geologist Juan Carlos Gutierrez Marco.

After
extensive anaylsis, the rock was confirmed to be a pre-historic 
metallic meteorite - a solid piece of debris from an asteroid or comet 
that survived an impact with the Earth's surface.

It is the fourth such meteorite to be found in Spain.

Previous ones were found near Quesa, in 1898, near Granada in 1912 and near Zaragoza in 1950.

Marco said: 'The object remained buried and because of that survived the times of the most demand for metals.'

Madrid's Mining Museum opened a display, featuring the fragment broken off for testing, on Wednesday. It is alongside a replica of the original.

Lopez, who officially owns the meteorite with his brother Ramon, told Spanish news agency EFE on Thursday they are weighing up whether to put it up for sale.

The siblings said they would like it to be 'sold quietly' provided they receive 'a tempting offer' that meets their expectations.

The family are considering selling the meteorite - but while they decide, they are moving it to a safe location

They told journalists they realised there was a worldwide market for meteorites and that an offer could be made online.

But they stressed they 'would not be making a final decision in the next few days' and have not ruled out keeping it for the family.

The pair have already been contacted by possible purchasers in Spain and abroad.

As they wait for the offers to flood in, the brothers have said they will keep it hidden in a safe place, where it will remain until they decide what to do.
