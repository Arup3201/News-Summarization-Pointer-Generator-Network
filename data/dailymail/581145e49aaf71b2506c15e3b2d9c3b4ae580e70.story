Jerry Sandusky's adopted son has opened up to Oprah Winfrey about his convicted pedophile father's bedtime 'ritual'.

Matthew Sandusky, one of the six children adopted by the Penn State coach and his wife, previously revealed he was sexually abused by his father for seven years, starting when he was just eight.

In an exclusive interview with Oprah, which will air in full onÂ OWN at 9pm on Thursday night, he revealed that the Sandusky home was a very happy place to be - until that bedtime ritual.

'The overnight visits were... they were good,' Matthew said in a preview clip for the interview. 'I mean, except for that one part: bedtime. Bedtime was the bad part.'

Speaking out: Matthew Sandusky will detail his abuse at the hands of his father in an interview this week

Brave: He will speak to Oprah Winfrey, right, in his first television interview since the trial in 2012

He explained: 'Any other time that we were in the home with the family, it was fine. You'd look at that family and you would say, "Wow. I wish that I had brothers and sisters that cared about me. I wish that I had a mother who cooked dinner every night for the whole family. I wish that I had all of these things.

'But then at bedtime, his ritual began.'

The interview will be his first television since his father was convicted in 2012.

Ahead of its airing, OWN explained that Matthew would be sharing 'a deeply personal account of the grooming, methodical control and manipulation he faced as a child'.

It adds 
that Matthew will respond 'to the accusations his adoptive mother, 
Dottie Sandusky, made on national television accusing him of lying and 
stealing from the family'.

Sandusky,
 who retired in June 30, 1999 as Penn State's defensive coordinator, was
 convicted in 2012 of molesting 10 boys over 15 years, some in the 
football team's showers on campus.

Pedophile: Jerry Sandusky, pictured in January 2013, was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison for his crimes

The 70-year-old is now serving a 30- to 60-year state prison sentence.

Matthew
 had met Sandusky when he attended his charity summer camp for 
underprivileged children and he often stayed the night with the family. 
He began living with the family full-time when he was 16.

He
 had been expected to be a defense witness for his father until the 
trial, when he told investigators that he also had been abused.

His story first
became public when a secret tape of a 29-minute interview he did with police 
during the middle of his father's trial was leaked to NBC.

In the
 tape, Matt said his father would enter his bedroom at night and 'blow 
raspberries' on his stomach, then move his hand down his body, rubbing 
up against his genitals.

He said he would sometimes cower 'in a fetal position' in his bed trying to avoid his father.

In total, he said he suffered seven years of molestation, between the ages of eight and 15, at the hands of his adoptive father. He initially denied there had been any abuse before speaking out.

In an interview for a documentary at the Sundance Film Festival in January, he said that he felt 'betrayed' by the entire Sandusky family after he took the decision to speak out against his father.

Hurtful: Matthew Sandusky said he felt betrayed by his adopted mother Dottie, right in 2011, after they failed to support him when he came forward with allegations about his father's abuse

But
 he said that he refused to be a 'coward' and risked everything to turn 
against those who had adopted him from a deprived upbringing and brought
 him up in an affluent household.

Last year he reached a settlement with Penn State and petitioned to legally change his
 name, and that of his wife and four children.

The interview comes a few weeks after Pennsylvania's attorney general released a review of the prosecution but found no evidence of political interference by then Governor Tom Corbett.

The report, however, did reveal three years of 'inexplicable delays' to prosecute the former Penn State football coach on child abuse charges.

The pedophile's home was not searched and the report notes that it took a full year, from March 2009 until March 2010, for the office to recommend charging Sandusky when 'Victim 1' came forward.

It took more 18 months before Sandusky was arrested because the prosecutor's supervisors believed the testimony of one victim would be 'insufficient against a community icon like Sandusky'.
