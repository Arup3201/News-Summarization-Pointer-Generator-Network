She failed to place in her hurdling events during last summer’s Olympic games, but now, Lolo Jones has taken home gold.

The 100-meter Olympic hurdler took home gold for her part in the U.S. team, the first in her very short bobsledding career.

The wunderkind debuted a disappointing performance at the London 2012 games, in spite of being named the favorite in the 100-meter hurdles.

Jones was brakewoman for Elana Meyers in the women's bobsled portion of an event that also added times in two-man bobsled plus men's and women's skeleton.

The U.S. edged Germany by 0.24 seconds even though the Germans won three of four disciplines on the Olympia track.

Jones added her first gold medal in her new sport to her two world titles in the indoor 60-meter hurdles, in 2008 and '10.

The winning U.S. team included two-man bobsled pilot Steven Holcomb, who earlier Sunday lost his title in his main event to the youngest world champion in history.

At 22 years, 270 days, Francesco Friedrich of Germany broke a record set in 1935 by Swiss driver Reto Capadrutt, according to bobsled's world governing body. Holcomb placed fourth.

Jones, a two-time Olympic hurdler, was one of 24 athletes announced last October as members of this season's U.S. bobsled team, something that gives her the chance to vie for a spot on the World Cup circuit this winter and, possibly, represent her country at the 2014 Sochi Games.

'This is a breath of fresh air – cool, very cool, cold air,' Jones said.

It's also what she said she desperately needed.

It's
 been a rocky few months for Jones, who was criticized by even some of 
her own track teammates at the London Games for the enormous attention 
she generates – and how that attention isn't always in line with 
accomplishment.

She 
was the gold-medal favorite before hitting a hurdle and finishing 
seventh at Beijing in 2008, then managed only a fourth-place finish in 
London this summer.

So 
in Lake Placid, she's tried to avoid the spotlight, even asking her new 
bobsled teammates if they're comfortable having her around.

The answer has been a resounding yes.

'I
 didn't have a lot of time to get to know Lolo through the media,' U.S. 
women's bobsled coach Todd Hays said. 'These three weeks, I've gotten to
 know her as an athlete. And she surprised me every day with how 
dedicated she is.

Olympic sprint gold medalist Tianna Madison – part of the world-record-setting 4x100-meter relay team in London – also made the team as a push athlete.

They're the ones tasked with helping get the sled moving down the icy chute, then jumping into the back seat for the bumpy ride to the finish.

The first time she went down the mountain, Jones was ready to quit – and remembers looking around for the ambulance, just in case.

A few runs later, she was hooked. 'Definitely a thrill,' Jones said.
