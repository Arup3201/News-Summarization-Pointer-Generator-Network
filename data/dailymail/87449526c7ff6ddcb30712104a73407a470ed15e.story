The abridged story of Michael Grant reads as follows.

A natural, muscle-bound athlete who excelled at baseball, basketball and American football; poor grades forced him to shelve his college dreams and try his hand at boxing.

Grant fought just 12 times as an amateur before turning professional and of his first 31 fights, only seven went the distance.

He was heavyweight boxing’s next big thing. Until he ran into Lennox Lewis at the turn of the millennium.

The newly-crowned undisputed champion of the world knocked Grant down three times in the first round before finishing him in the second.

Grant would never get another shot at the title and his most recent fight was a fifth-round stoppage defeat last year at the age of 42.

Born in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and standing at the same 6ft 7in as Grant, Deontay Wilder also dreamed of making it on the football field or the basketball court but his life changed after the birth of his daughter Naieya in 2005. Instead of playing as a wide receiver or a forward, he stepped into a boxing gym for the first time. And so began a whirlwind journey.

A two-year amateur career culminated in a bronze medal at the 2008 Olympics and, after just 30 fights, he turned professional.

Seven years later, on Saturday night at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Wilder has his chance to win a world title against the WBC champion Bermane Stiverne in one of the most meaningful and anticipated heavyweight fights of the last decade. He is two years older than Grant was but his record is even more impressive: 32 knockouts from as many fights. He has never been beyond the fourth round.

But Wilder’s resume is constantly under scrutiny. His best win to date is a first-round stoppage of Malik Scott last year but his record is also littered with names like Audley Harrison, Jason Gavern and Matthew Greer.

‘I think this is definitely my chance now to shut the critics up, the naysayers, the haters, the non-believers, the a*******, the d******** or whatever you want to call them – I’m ready to shut them all up,’ he says.

‘We’ll see if he [Stiverne] is a test or not. Like I say, many came before him who were supposed to be a test for me and I made the impossible possible by knocking them out when I wasn’t supposed to do it, and now they suddenly became bums, so we’ll see on Saturday if he is a true test.

‘I feel no matter what I do there’s still going to be somebody out there with an opinion on something and there’s always going to be someone out there with something to say so I’m not trying to please nobody.’

While there is no doubting his power, Wilder has never been in trouble in a professional ring.

And he has never faced anyone like Stiverne.

The Haitian, born the youngest of 14 children, moved to Miami when he was 10 and turned to boxing when injury curtailed a promising football career.

He has also spent time in Canada but has lived in Las Vegas for a decade.

Stiverne knocked out his first dozen opponents before suffering a surprise defeat to Demetrice King. A six-round draw with Charles Davis would be the only other blot on his record before his double-header with Chris Arreola thrust him into the limelight.

Promoted by Don King, who is enjoying perhaps his final fling at the top of the heavyweight game, Stiverne outpointed Arreola in their first meeting before the pair clashed again for the vacant WBC title last May following Vitali Klitschko’s retirement.

This time, Stiverne knocked Arreola down twice before the referee stepped in to halt his punishment.

Stiverne is the reigning WBC heavyweight champion and will provide a real test for Wilder

‘It’s going to be a real fight, a fight like you’ve never seen before,’ the champion says. ‘I’m no cab driver, I’m no one-hit wonder, this is the real deal. This belt here isn’t going anywhere. This green belt is staying right here.

‘Everyone who has supported me, you won’t be disappointed. I’ve seen plenty of guys like Wilder, even guys who talk more than him.

‘It’s going to be a short night. It’s going to be painful - really painful. And I will send him home with no belt. If he has not gone past four rounds, that is not my business ‐ that is his business.

‘All I have to say is that after Saturday, all the people that had questions about this man will get the answers - more than the answers. I don’t care if he went 24 rounds or whatever it is. It doesn’t matter. All I am saying is I can’t wait.

‘After this fight you will never ever hear about Deontay Wilder.’

It is eight years since America had a heavyweight champion of the world when Shannon Briggs reigned for seven short months.

The dominance of Wladimir Klitschko, who holds the other three major belts, has diluted interest in what was once the greatest prize in sport.

‘That’s definitely the significance behind it [this world title fight],’ says Wilder. ‘Just bring the belt back. It’s been a long time coming. A lot of Americans have been yearning for an American champion – they want an American champion, they want the excitement.

‘If any fighter in America is up for that job then hands down it’s me. I’ve got everything. I’m the total package - I’m entertaining, I’m exciting, I got charisma and I’ve got that one-punch knockout power, that’s what everyone comes to see.’

Wilder is certainly entertaining; but he is also unpredictable.

Last year, he beat up internet troll Charlie Zelenoff who had harassed the boxer on social media and made comments about his daughter who has spina bifida.

The video went viral but asked serious questions about his temperament.

‘People don’t know what it took me to get here,’ he adds. ‘Nothing has been given to me and I appreciate every little thing I have. This made me who I am in life.

‘I knew it was going to take hard work to get that belt and I’m ready for that test. This is my time; I don’t think my opponent understands purpose because this is my time.

‘When I do the unexpected, I don’t want you all to degrade this man, Stiverne. I don’t want anyone to make excuses for my victory. Stick by your word. Let this be a test for me and watch me pass my test. I guarantee I will do it.’
