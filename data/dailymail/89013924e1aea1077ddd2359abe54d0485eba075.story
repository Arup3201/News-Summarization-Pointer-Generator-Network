A rare badger suffered horrific deep bite wounds following a fight over its territory and had to be admitted to a rescue centre. 

The male badger was found in an outdoor toilet in Beaminster in Dorset and was admitted to RSPCA West Hatch Wildlife Centre in Taunton, Somerset with wounds to its neck and rump.

Experts believe the animal is likely to have been injured in a fight over its territory because females usually give birth in February and are ready to mate again straight away - leading to fierce competition between males. 

A rare albino badger was taken to a rescue centre after being found with deep bite wounds to its neck and rump, believed to have been caused by fighting over territory during the current mating season 

RSPCA wildlife centre supervisor Paul Oaten said: 'Albino badgers are fairly rare so to have one admitted to the centre only happens once in a blue moon.

'This poor badger came in to us with territorial bite wounds on his neck and rump, but other than that he is in good condition.

'He has been seen by the vet and had the wounds cleaned up and will be undergoing a course of antibiotics.' 

Mr Oaten said it was common to see badgers with these type of wounds during the breeding season. 

The injured animal was rescued as dozens of badgers have been born in Somerset, in time for Spring. 

Staff at Secret World Wildlife Rescue in Somerset are caring for three badger cubs which need feeding around the clock. 

The first cub, named Little Star, has grown from 80g to over a kilogram since being rescued and cared for by the centre.

The animal was brought in from the cold into a house in Derbyshire by a Jack Russell, who carried it in its jaws. 

She has been joined by another eight-week old badger cub called Vogue.

The third badger cub arrived only a week ago after being found with injuries caused by a dog.

There has been an increase in births of badgers, like these three, during Spring in Somerset 

Little Star was rescued after being brought in from the outside in a Jack Russell's jaws and nursed to health
