An earthquake has struck rural China killing more than 56 people, injuring hundreds and destroying thousands of homes.

According to the local government, the shallow quake hit near the city of Dingxi, in central Gansu 
province, an arid region of mountains, desert and pastureland, early this morning.

Residents described shaking windows and swinging lights. The local government said at least 400 people had been injured by the quake, which measured up to magnitude 6.6.

In Minxian county, Gansu province, one hospital, overflowing with injured patients, was forced to set up makeshift treatment area outside, with beds, IV drips and umbrellas to shelter from the sun.

There was reportedly relatively little major damage or panic in Dingxi city itself. The surrounding dry and hilly farming area appears to have been worse affected.

An additional 14 people were 
reportedly missing on top of the 56 dead, and 412 were injured, the 
provincial government said in a statement posted online.

The
deaths and injuries were reported in Min County and other rural 
southern parts of the municipality, Dingxi Mayor Tang Xiaoming told 
state broadcaster CCTV. 

Tang said damage was worst in the 
counties of Zhang and Min, where scores of homes were damaged and 
telephone and electricity services knocked out.

The Chinese Red Cross said it was shipping 200 tents, 1,000 sets of household items, and 2,000 jackets to the area

Rescuers told a state television service that progress was being slowed by mud and rock slides blocking the road

Su Wei, leader of a 120-member rescue 
team from the paramilitary People's Armed Police, told state broadcaster
CCTV that they were on their way to the epicenter, but progress was 
being slowed by mud and rock slides blocking the road.

The
Chinese Red Cross said it was shipping 200 tents, 1,000 sets of 
household items, and 2,000 jackets to the area and sending teams from 
both Lanzhou and Beijing to help with relief work and assess further 
needs.

Heavy rain is 
expected in the area later in the week, raising the need for shelter and
increasing the chance of further landslides.

More
than 1,200 homes were destroyed by the quake, with another 21,000 badly
damaged, provincial government spokesman Chang Zhengguo was quoted as 
saying by the official Xinhua News Agency.

Tremors were felt in the provincial capital of Lanzhou 177 kilometers (110 miles) north, and as far away as Xi'an, 400 kilometers (250 miles) to the east.

'You could see the chandeliers wobble
and the windows vibrating and making noise, but there aren't any cracks
in the walls. Shop assistants all poured out onto the streets when the 
shaking began,' said a front desk clerk at the Wuyang Hotel in the Zhang
County seat about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the epicenter.

The
government's earthquake monitoring centre said the initial quake at 
7.45am (2345 GMT Sunday) was magnitude 6.6 and subsequent tremors 
included a magnitude 5.6.

The quake was shallow, which can be more destructive, the Chinese earthquake monitoring centre said, although reports on the depth of the epicentre differed

The quake was shallow, which can be more destructive, the centre said, although reports on the depth of the epicentre differed.

The Chinese government's monitoring centre said it struck about 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) beneath the surface, while the Gansu provincial earthquake administration said it was just 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) deep.

The U.S. Geological Survey measured the magnitude of the initial quake as 5.9 and the depth at 10 kilometers (6 miles).

Initial measurements of an earthquake can vary widely, especially if different monitoring equipment is used.

According to the local government, the shallow quake hit near the city of Dingxi, in central Gansu province, in red, an arid region of mountains, desert and pastureland, early this morning

With a population of 26 million, Gansu is one of China's more lightly populated provinces, although the New Jersey-sized area of Dingxi has a greater concentration of farms in rolling hills terraced with fields for crops and fruit trees. Dingxi has a total population of about 2.7 million.

China's worst earthquake in recent years was a 7.9-magnitude temblor that struck the southwestern province of Sichuan in 2008, leaving 90,000 people dead or missing.
