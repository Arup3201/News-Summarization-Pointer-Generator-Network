Show mercy: Amanda Innes sent a message to Malaysian authorities begging: 'Please don't hang my daughter - I know she's innocent'

A mother has pleaded with Malaysia not to send her daughter – herself a mother of six - to the gallows after she was allegedly found in a car with more than 2lbs of the drug ice under a seat.

Amanda Innes sent a message to Malaysian authorities begging: ‘Please don’t hang my daughter – I know she’s innocent.’

Emma Louise L’Aiguille, 34, who has given birth to eight children, two of which died in infancy, was driving a car with a Nigerian man sitting in the passenger seat when the vehicle was stopped and searched by police.

Officials claim they found ice under the passenger seat – and Miss L’Aiguille was charged with possession, a crime that would mean a mandatory death sentence if she is convicted.

In a passionate plea to Malaysia, Miss Aiguille’s mother, who lives near Melbourne, said: ‘Please don’t hang her. I just want the Government to do all they can.

‘I just want her to be brought home alive.’

She told Melbourne’s Herald-Sun newspaper that her daughter, a nurse’s aide, was on a tourist visa in Malaysia, where she was visiting her boyfriend.

‘I understand it’s hanging over there and I would ask the government to spare her that and give her life in prison if she is convicted,’ Mrs Innes told Fairfax radio.

‘No parent would hope that their child was doing drugs or anything like that.’

She said the Australian consulate was getting medical help for her daughter to help her with ‘depression or something.’

She added: ‘If she had been on drugs then she’d be coming off them, so she’d need medical help to come off it.’

‘Ice’, also known as ‘crystal’ or ‘crystal meth’ due to its crystalline appearance,  is a highly purifiedbform of the drug methamphetamine.

It is a man-made drug, often manufactured in illegal laboratories using a range of pharmaceutical drugs mixed with other toxic chemicals.

It increases arousal in nervous system: pumps up levels of norepinephrine and dopamine.

Anxiety, emotional swings, and paranoia are common psychological effects of chronic use.

Overdose is a huge risk: Symptoms include fever, convulsions, and coma.

Highs
 tend to last 4-12 hours with users continuing to take the drug for 
days - sometimes addicts stay awake for days, eat very little and in 
heightened state of arousal.

But she said she did not believe her daughter had a history of drug use.

Miss Aiguille was stopped by police as
 she drove through Kuala Lumpur. Her passenger was arrested with her, 
but a second man fled the scene.

Malaysia shows no mercy to drug traffickers or people in possession of more than 15grams of prohibited drugs.

A
 Briton, 28-year-old Kevin Barlow, who also held Australian citizenship,
 and his Australian companion, Brian Chambers, were hanged side by side 
in Kuala Lumpur in 1986 for trying to leave Malaysia with heroin packed 
in a suitcase.

Three years later Briton Derrick Gregory, 39, was hanged in Kuala Lumpur after being found with more than a pound of heroin.

‘Ice’, also known as ‘crystal’ or ‘crystal meth’ due to its crystalline appearance,  is a term used to describe a form of the drug methamphetamine.

It is a highly purified form of methamphetamine and the most potent. This is the main reason why the drug is considered dangerous and can be powerfully addictive.

It is a man-made drug, often manufactured in illegal laboratories using a range of pharmaceutical drugs.

They are then mixed with other toxic, corrosive and flammable chemicals such as red 
 phosphorus, hydrochloric acid, methylated spirits and acetone.
