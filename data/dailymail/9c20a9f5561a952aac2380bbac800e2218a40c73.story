A lollipop man has been banned from high-fiving school children by council bosses who say it 'confuses drivers'.

Roger Green was told that he cannot greet pupils from Sandy Lane Primary School in Bracknell, Berkshire, with the gesture because a driver said it slowed down traffic.

Hundreds of parents have reacted angrily to the ban by Bracknell Forest Council and some have complained to the school.

Roger Green, 64, has been banned from high-fiving children because it 'confuses the drivers'

Parents have criticised the decision as 'ridiculous' and are considering a petition to have it overturned

The council said the simple greeting puts Mr Green and the children 'at risk'.

Mr Green, 64, who has worked as lollipop man for three years, said: 'I put a sign up for couple of days saying that due to a complaint I could no longer high-five children.

'The parents complained as they can't understand why the ban is in place.

'I have to follow what my boss says, but it is a harmless piece of fun and all the children like it.'

Mother-of-four Leith Kilmartin, 33, said the high-fives used to 'make the children's day'.

She said: 'He is the sweetest man, he loves children and is good at what he does. He is not taking his attention away from the traffic so I think it is ridiculous. We may start a petition.'

Another mother Suzanne Curtis said her young children do not understand why they cannot high-five Mr Green anymore.

Bracknell Forest Council said the high-fives put Mr Green and the children 'at risk'

She said: 'It's a little thing but it means so much to the kids.'

Mr Green helps children from Sandy Lane school and Garth Hill College cross Folders Lane.

He is well-known for joining in with school events such as dressing up as a Christmas tree or wearing pyjamas.

Joanne Fuller, 36, said: 'There are not many lollipop men like Mr Green.

'I have been a parent at Sandy Lane for 14 years and have never had a problem with the school, but this is disgusting and stupid.'

Kieran McGuire's five-year-old son wanted to walk a longer route on the way to school just so he could high-five Mr Green.

The 33-year-old, said: 'It gives kids a bit of fun on the way to school and is providing them with nice memories.'

A Bracknell Forest Council spokeswoman said: 'Roger Green has a great relationship with the schoolchildren and everyone appreciates his friendliness, good humour, and his work to keep the children safe.

'Parents rightly expect us to teach and supervise children to cross roads as quickly and safely as possible.

'Children stopping as they cross the road for a "high-five" puts them and the crossing patrol man at risk and confuses drivers.

'Parents wouldn't thank us if we let this continue.'
