Four members of a family have been jailed after a former boxer beat his sister’s ex-boyfriend to a pulp and then left him for dead.

Joe Bath, 26, from Margate, Kent, was so badly beaten that his mother didn’t even recognise him when he lay on the verge of death in his hospital bed.

He was targeted by the family of his ex-girlfriend, Jade Cekic, 22, after she headbutted him in a heated row at a nightclub in Margate last August.

Soon after the fight Jade’s brother, Lee Cekic, 24, arrived at the club to talk to Mr Bath and managed to persuade him to get into his car.

Cekic, from Broadstairs, Kent, took him on a terror ride and, when Mr Bath tried to kick himself out of the vehicle, the former boxer unleashed a merciless attack on the father of his sister’s child.

Mr Bath was left bloodied and beaten after being repeatedly punched and kicked by Cekic, who held a key in his fist during the attack.

The victim was taken out of the car twice and beaten to the point that he was on the verge of death.

He was twice knocked unconscious and left with a fractured skull before eventually managing to flee to a nearby house in a bid to call for help.

The injuries were later described by doctors as life-threatening.

He suffered stab wounds to his head, two bleeds on the brain, a fractured skull and significant bruising all over his body.

As Mr Bath lay on the verge of death in his hospital bed, his girlfriend’s family begun a cover up that would soon see them all behind bars.

Lee immediately took his car to the Herne Bay sea front and torched it in a bid to hide evidence - believing he had killed Mr Bath.

'It was a sickening and violent attack which left the victim with horrendous injuries and he will be scarred for life'

- Detective Chief Inspector Paul Fotheringham

His father Negovan Cekic, 52, arrived in his Mercedes to pick up the attacker before they sped from the scene of the crime.

They were stopped by police with Lee Cekic still reeking from the petrol he had used to destroy his car.

He was taken in for questioning by Kent Police and soon a tale of lies began to unfold.

Jade Cekic lied to police about what she had been wearing at the club and her mother, Paula Cekic, 43, deleted incriminating telephone texts and lied about knowing where her husband had gone.

But the family were soon uncovered 
when detectives taped prison conversations between Cekic and his mother in
which he said: 'They got me bang to rights on everything.'

An
investigation uncovered mobile phone conversations between Cekic and 
his parents as they attempted to assist their children cover up the 
attack.

DCI Paul Fotheringham (pictured) said: 'There is no doubt in my mind that Lee Cekic intended to seriously hurt Mr Bath and subjected him to a terrifying and horrific ordeal'

And in another chat with his sister, the attacker said: 'He had to go at the end of the day didn’t he? If I didn’t do it then no one else would, would they?'

And he also revealed to a friend: 'I lost it. I just saw red and lost it. Just went mad mate and lost the plot.'

A spiral of lies quickly emerged and the family were left with little choice but to admit to their cover-up.

Lee was jailed yesterday at Canterbury Crown Court after admitting to causing grievous bodily harm with intent and false imprisonment.

Sentencing him to a 10-year custodial sentence with five more years on licence Judge Adele Williams said he would only be released when the authorities thought it safe for him to return to society.

Judge Williams added that Cekic had 
beaten his victim 'to a pulp' with a car key found by police that was 
'encrusted with Mr Bath’s blood'.

The judge also commended police officers for their 'excellent' work on the case.

Parents, Negovan and Paula, and 
sister, Jade, were all jailed for 21 months after admitting to 
attempting to pervert the course of justice.

Dominic
Connolly, prosecuting, said: 'This incident all centres around the 
former relationship between Joe Bath and Jade Cekic who were in a 
relationship which ended two years ago but have a daughter.

'There
was an argument in which Mr Bath claims he was headbutted and punched 
by her. As a result she was ejected from the club. Some five to 10 
minutes later, Mr Bath was told that Lee was outside and wished to speak
to him.

'When I first saw my son in hospital I didn’t recognise him. I almost walked past him. I thought he was going to die'

- Deborah Bath

'He was then asked to follow the car down to an area where there was no CCTV. He did so and then got into the car voluntarily, which was then driven out of Margate. He was then lunged at by Lee and was hit by something sharp - a key.

'He was then forced out of the car 
and subjected to a beating, which included punching and kicking to the 
head, face and back. He lost consciousness. And when he was examined at 
hospital he was unable to open his eyes because they were so swollen and
had dried blood covering his face and scalp. A scan later revealed a 
fracture to his skull.'

After
the hearing, Mr Bath’s mother Deborah Bath said: 'When I first saw my 
son in hospital I didn’t recognise him. I almost walked past him. I 
thought he was going to die.'

She also revealed that since the attack, her son had become 'very quiet'.

Detective Chief Inspector Paul Fotheringham, of the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said: 'There is no doubt in my mind that Lee Cekic intended to seriously hurt Mr Bath and subjected him to a terrifying and horrific ordeal.

'It was a sickening and violent attack which left the victim with horrendous injuries and he will be scarred for life.

'The offender’s parents and his sister then assisted Lee in attempting to cover up this crime giving false statements to the police and trying to shift the blame elsewhere.

'Mr Bath has shown great courage and bravery by standing up to his attacker in providing evidence and I would also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the officers who carried out thorough and painstaking investigations and uncovered the full extent of the assault despite attempts to cover it up.'
