Dylan Hartley and the rest of Northampton’s England contingent checked in for Test duty last night satisfied that their club are set fair in their pursuit of domestic and European titles.

George North shone with four tries, but he was aided by England players. Luther Burrell’s hand injury was an alarming sight for England head coach Stuart Lancaster but flankers Calum Clark and Tom Wood were impressive, as was lock Courtney Lawes and Stephen Myler was largely assured in contributing 14 points with the boot.

As ever, Northampton will contribute more than their share of manpower to the country’s cause as England prepare to face New Zealand, South Africa, Samoa and Australia in the QBE Test series, and Hartley claimed that he and his fellow Saints will start the international window in good heart.

Asked about the European challenge, he said: ‘It’s not dead, is it? It’s not dead.

‘We’re sitting at the top of the Premiership, which is nice, and our European campaign is still alive. We’ve got two weeks of LV Cup now and we’ve got some boys champing at the bit; some young players ready for a game. We’re in a good place.

‘I feel pretty good but Tom Wood’s nose looks pretty messed up! Other than that all the (England) boys are in good nick and we’re excited — it’s a big series coming up and a huge game to start.’

Clark has earned an England recall with his prodigious form and he was a forceful presence again in this demolition of the Ospreys, who were previously unbeaten this season. 

The blindside was particularly effective at the breakdown and Hartley offered an endorsement of his credentials for national service.

‘He’s a grafter,’ said his captain. ‘He’s on the ball, on the floor, working hard, making tackles, covering metres. You want someone like that in your team.’

Hartley admitted he was ‘worried’ before the hosts clinched the bonus point courtesy of North’s fourth try. 

‘George saved the day,’ he said, while director of rugby, Jim Mallinder, added: ‘He showed what a talented all-round player he is because he came into the centre tonight and did so well. It was a tremendous performance.’

Stuart Lancaster last night called up nine players to England’s training squad with uncapped Exeter centre Henry Slade in for the first time and clubmate Thomas Waldrom recalled.

Leicester lost 15-3 in Llanelli as the Scarlets showed their opportunistic streak in Pool Two. 

The Welsh region claimed two tries from Tigers’ mistakes, as wing Harry Robinson seized on a fumble by Miles Benjamin in the first half, while Aled Davies struck just after the hour, having intercepted a pass by Ben Youngs. 

Toulon are now in control of the pool after beating Ulster 23-13.

The No 10’s goal-kicking meant a late penalty try for the French side could not prevent a famous victory for Gregor Townsend’s men. 

They top the table, after starting with a 37-10 home win over Bath.
