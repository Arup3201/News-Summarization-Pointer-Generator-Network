It is the spiritual home of the Church of England - but Canterbury is failing to get in the Christmas mood after after Scrooge-like council bosses refused to spend money on festive lights.

Local residents have complained that the decision has left the historic city centre looking 'dark and depressing' with some saying it reminds them of the war days.

But John Gilbey, Canterbury City Council leader, insists leaving the high street without Christmas lights is the right thing to do in the face of its growing budget crisis.

Protest: Traders have staged protests after Canterbury City Council refused to spend money on Christmas lights for the high street

The council has been ordered to make savings of £5.5million by 2017, and cutting the funding for illuminations will spare £56,000 - but traders are furious at the council's attitude.

The Kent city is home to Canterbury Cathedral - the most important place of worship in the Anglican Church - where the Archbishop of Canterbury, leader of the Church of England delivers his Christmas sermon on Christmas Day.

John Hippisley, leader of the Canterbury Independent Traders Alliance, said: 'It beggars belief that Canterbury - the very cradle of Christianity - doesn't have any Christmas lights.

Action: Campaigners organised a protest to put pressure on the council to reverse its decision

'Every town and city up and down England has Christmas lights, but here we have none. It's a public disgrace.

'All the little businesses are really struggling in the recession and they were banking on Christmas trade to help them through. It's the most important time of year for them.

'But without any Christmas lights, the city just looks dull, dark and depressing. One pensioner told me it felt like the war, all over again.'

He said he fears customers will go to the nearby shopping centre in Bluewater as it's more appealing with 'fantastic Christmas lights'.

'Traders have told me that trade is much worse than last Christmas and it's a real worry,' he said.

Meanwhile campaigner Steve Coombs 
organised a protest march through the city last weekend to put pressure 
on the council to reverse its decision.

He
said: 'A lot of people are dismayed about the lack of Christmas lights.
The council have underspent by nearly £1million this year, so why can't
they afford some lights?'

Only the Whitefriars precinct and the King's Mile in Canterbury have lights to lift the mood.

These have been funded privately, 
although a grant from the council was put towards the display in 
independent traders' area King's Mile.

A local business has paid for a Christmas tree in the city centre, with the council paying around £2,000 to decorate it.

Disgrace: Traders have labelled the decision a 'public disgrace', and pensioner said the darkness made it feel 'like the war'

Mr Hippisley added: 'I looked into the
costs of hiring and putting up Christmas lights in the high street, but
the public liability insurance would have cost £7,000, making it 
prohibitively expensive.

'The
council has the money, but they don't want to celebrate Christmas. 
Instead they've squirreled away £103,000 for re-paving an area of the 
city that does not need repaving and they've set aside £17,000 to 
refurbish the Lord Mayor's robes.

'Does anyone even care about the Lord Mayor's robes? I know most people here would prefer to have some Christmas lights.'

A spokesman from Canterbury City Council said that start-up grants totalling around £10,000 have been given to community and business groups 
in Herne Bay and Whitstable to help them take over the organisation of the lights in their towns.

Councillor
Gilbey said: 'It was inevitable that this day would come. Christmas 
lights were a nice thing to do when we had money, but now they are not 
of sufficient quality to make a difference and there is simply no cash 
to invest in new displays.

'Instead of persisting with something sub-standard, the only option left is to stop doing it.

Rival: Traders fear that shoppers will instead turn to Bluewater shopping centre in Greenhithe

'Much has been said in the media and elsewhere about cuts in council funding. This is one very real example of its impact'

He added: 'As the money goes down, we are going to have to take more difficult decisions not to do things, in order to protect important frontline services and the services we are required to provide by law.

'It's not an easy message, but I think people need to be prepared to see more of the things they like disappearing in the years ahead.'
