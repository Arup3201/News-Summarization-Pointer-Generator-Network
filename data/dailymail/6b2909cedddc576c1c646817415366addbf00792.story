There are some experiences in life which money simply cannot buy.

As a son of Hamilton growing up a Rangers supporter, the Old Firm rivalry coursed through Barry Ferguson’s veins as soon as he was old enough to distinguish blue from green.

Once resident at Ibrox, countless pep-talks and first-hand accounts of playing in the famous fixture were on tap from the former midfielder and club captain.

And yet, reflecting now on his first taste of the game — a goalless draw at the outset of season 1998-99 — he believes words alone are inadequate to accurately convey the out-of-body experience that awaits Sunday’s debutants.

‘I probably touched the ball five or six times and I was poor,’ he recalled of the match at the outset of Dick Advocaat’s era in charge.

‘Everything flew past me and I learned to play better next time.

‘You honestly don’t know what to expect. I played in some games where it just flew past me and then the whistle went.

‘I was left there thinking: “I didn’t even turn up there” because I hadn’t been involved, whereas in other games it was great.

‘It’s a strange game. Often there’s no point in shouting at your team-mates as they can’t hear you.

‘I had a mixture of emotions in the game and the emotion you want is a winning one.

‘If you get that, the fans have the bragging rights and that’s what you want. It’s not just for you and your team-mates, it’s for however many thousand fans are there supporting you, too.

‘You shouldn’t forget that.’

Ferguson’s career offers him a sharp sense of perspective on the Old Firm’s true standing in the British game.

His first departure from Rangers saw him land at Blackburn Rovers, where jousts with near-neighbours Burnley were eagerly awaited.

A second spell in England with Birmingham City came with the rarefied atmosphere of the Midlands clash with Aston Villa.

Meaty though both games were, Ferguson insists there was simply no comparison with the meeting of Celtic and Rangers.

‘I got told it (the Midlands derby) was going to be mental and it was just like a normal game,’ he shrugged.

‘After it, away from the ground, there were maybe a few riots but apart from that it was normal.

‘You can’t hear yourself talk when you’re in an Old Firm game. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still passionate down there but this is a different ball game.’

An occasion for experience if ever there was one then. Of Celtic’s likely starting side, only Adam Matthews, Emilio Izaguirre, Scott Brown, Kris Commons and Anthony Stokes have derby memories in their scrap books.

For all their lower league status, Lee Wallace, Kenny Miller, Lee McCulloch and Kris Boyd are well placed to talk the Old Firm novices in the blue corner through an afternoon they are unlikely to forget in a hurry. All have a key role to play.

‘I’m sure they will have a massive influence on the dressing room,’ added Ferguson. ‘They will let people know what it’s all about.’

They could do a lot worse than listen to Ferguson’s list of dos and don’ts. The scorer of an equalising free-kick in Rangers’ 3-2 triumph in the 2002 Scottish Cup final, he also failed to see out the 90 minutes at Celtic Park two years previously as Martin O’Neill’s side ran riot in a 6-2 win.

Given the sharply contrasting fortunes both sides of the great divide have experienced in recent years, many standing in the green corner feel a repeat of that latter score-line is not beyond the realms of possibility.

Ferguson acknowledges that, for Rangers to prevail on Sunday, they will have to hit heights not seen too often of late, while Celtic’s levels will have to drop.

But, like half of Hampden Park, he feels that’s entirely possible.

‘Form goes out the window and it doesn’t matter what league you are in,’ he insisted.

‘Old Firm games are about who wants it most on the day.

‘It doesn’t matter if Celtic are top of the league and playing well while Rangers are going through a sticky patch.

‘There were times going into Rangers-Celtic games where we were having a hellish time and we won the game.

‘I know a lot of people say it but form and whatever league you’re in don’t matter. It’s a whole different ball game.

‘The atmosphere surrounding it and the week building up to the game are different. A lot of people are thinking it’s going to be an easy ride for Celtic but I don’t think so.

‘All that matters is the result.’

Ferguson learned quickly that sufficient random factors are always at play in the fixture to make betting on it a mug’s game.

Bold predictions of acts of derring-do are ill-advised too. Pride coming before a fall, and all that.

John Guidetti is perhaps a case in point. The Swede may indeed have said he hoped to score a hat-trick in the game, as opposed to him predicting it, but it was still dressing-room wall fodder.

And this, too, from a man who’s recently looked as much as a goal threat as Craig Gordon.

‘You do your talking on the pitch, not off the pitch,’ Ferguson mused. ‘That’s the way I like it done. Be respectful and if you’ve got things you want to do on the pitch, do them.

‘Don’t speak out because you can end up with custard pie on your face.’

Three years in the making, Sunday’s clash will necessitate predictions from everyone from the working man to Heads of State.

For those who have stood tall in the midst of a multi-coloured hurricane, such talk is fraught with danger.

‘Pundits have their say but I never took that into account because you need to actually be involved to realise what it’s all about,’ said the current Clyde manager.

Man’s great enemy – time – means on Sunday, Ferguson will be as powerless as the rest of us to affect the outcome. What he’d give to sample it one more time, though.

‘My head says aye but my legs say differently,’ he smiled.
