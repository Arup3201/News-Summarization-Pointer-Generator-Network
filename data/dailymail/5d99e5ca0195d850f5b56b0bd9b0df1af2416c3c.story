Women who drink throughout pregnancy will not be criminalised after a landmark ruling today (posed by  model)

Women who drink alcohol while pregnant will not be criminalised after a landmark ruling today.

It comes after a test case held at the Court of Appeal ruled that a young child is not entitled to criminal injuries compensation after her mother drank half a bottle of vodka and eight cans of lager a day while she was pregnant with her. 

The girl, now six, was born with foetal alcohol syndrome and suffered growth retardation as a result of her mother's drinking. 

Lawyers for child 'CP', who cannot be named for legal reasons, had asked three judges to rule in a test case that the girl is entitled to compensation. 

But the appeal judges unanimously ruled: 'The central reason is that we have held that a mother who is pregnant and who drinks to excess despite knowledge of the potential harmful consequence to the child of doing so is not guilty of a criminal offence under our law if her child is subsequently born damaged as a result.'

If the appeal had succeeded it could have paved the way for pregnant women's behaviour to be criminalised, according to the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (Bpas) and Birthrights.

Lawyers for the child say that view was 'misplaced speculation'.

Ann Furedi, chief executive of the Bpas, and Rebecca Schiller, co-chair of Birthrights, welcomed the court's unanimous decision, saying: 'This is an extremely important ruling for women everywhere.

'The UK's highest courts have recognised that women must be able to make their own decisions about their pregnancies.' 

The appeal judges heard that a large number of similar claims for compensation by children allegedly harmed by alcohol in the womb were awaiting the outcome of CP's appeal, with solicitors already instructed in around 80 cases.

Lord Dyson, the Master of the Rolls, sitting with Lord Justice Treacy and Lady Justice King, considered the case recently at a one-day hearing.

The judges were told that the mother was drinking 'an enormous amount' while pregnant with CP, including a half-bottle of vodka and eight cans of strong lager a day, and the child was born with an alcohol-related disease.

John Foy QC, appearing for CP, said that was the equivalent of 40-57 units of alcohol a day. Guidelines issued by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) were that 7.5 units might damage a foetus.

Mr Foy was representing a council in the North West of England which now has responsibility for CP and was seeking an award on her behalf under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme.

He said the mother 'was aware of the dangers to her baby of her excessive consumption during pregnancy'.

He added: 'She was reckless as to whether there would be harm to the foetus. She foresaw that harm might be caused but went on to take the risk.'

CP was born in June 2007 with foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), also referred to as foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). It can cause retarded growth, facial abnormalities and intellectual impairment.

Her compensation claim was based on the assertion that her mother had committed an offence against her as defined under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 by drinking excessively during pregnancy.

Ben Collins, appearing for the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA), asked the court to reject CP's legal challenge.

He told the judges: 'There is a conflict of ideas about what is or is not dangerous, not only in terms of drink but also in terms of smoking and food.'

If the appeal at the Court of Appeal had succeeded it could have paved the way for pregnant women's behaviour to be criminalised, according to the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (Bpas) and Birthrights

Mr Collins asked whether 'a pregnant mother who eats unpasteurised cheese or a soft boiled egg knowing there is a risk that it could give rise to a risk of harm to the foetus' might also find herself accused of a crime.

FASD was diagnosed 252 times in England in 2012 to 2013.

CP's compensation application was initially rejected by the CICA in November 2009 on the grounds that she had not sustained an injury 'directly attributable to a crime of violence', as required by the Offences Against the Person Act.

A first-tier tribunal allowed her initial appeal but the Upper Tribunal of the Administrative Appeals Chamber ruled last December that the law required a crime to be committed against an individual 'person' - and a child did not become a person until birth.

The Upper Tribunal concluded: 'If (the girl) was not a person while her mother was engaging in the relevant actions then, as a matter of law, her mother could not have committed a criminal offence.'

Asking the appeal judges to quash the Upper Tribunal decision, Mr Foy argued CP had been a person entitled to compensation while still a foetus and the crime committed against had similar ingredients to manslaughter.

Alternatively, she became entitled to an award when she was born and was suffering the continuing consequences of her alcoholic mother's drinking.

Mr Foy said CP was the young mother's second pregnancy and the woman was well aware of the risks.

But she had recklessly 'administered a noxious thing - a destructive thing' to her unborn daughter and inflicted grievous bodily harm for which the child should be compensated.

Dismissing CP's appeal, Lord Justice Treacy said an 'essential ingredient' for a crime to be committed 'is the infliction of grievous bodily harm on a person - grievous bodily harm on a foetus will not suffice'. 

A mother who admitted drinking  two bottles of wine a day while pregnant has said she believes she has permanently damaged one of her two children.

The woman - who spoke to Radio 5 Live named only as Kathryn - said she feels guilt over her excessive drinking, but said she was an alcoholic and lost 'the power of choice'.

She told the interview that she came from a happy, stable family but started drinking every night after finishing university. 

Every night soon became every lunchtime too and she eventually lost her high-profile job.

But she said when she discovered she was pregnant at the age of 30, she was delighted.

'I knew 100 per cent I would not drink if I was pregnant, because I couldn't do that to a child. 

'But because I am an alcoholic I don't have that choice, I lost that power of choice, and after a month I relapsed and I started drinking.' 

Kathryn said she was drinking as much as two bottles of wine a day but played down just how much she was consuming throughout her first pregnancy. 

Despite this her first child was healthy and was monitored by doctors for two years after he was born, and did not appear to have suffered any long term damage.

But during her second pregnancy, Kathryn said she relapsed after the first trimester and started to drink 'a hell of a lot'

Now she fears her son, who is seven is siffering the long term effects. 

She said: 'It is behavioural, poor concentration, bad language, poor social behaviour, poor eye contact. 

'I chose not to tell the doctors about my drinking because of the stugma of it, and he was diagnosed as being on autistic spectrum. 

'I really struggled with it, and felt guilty, thinking it was me who had done it to him. 

But I was ill at the time, I lost that choice. All I can do now is be a sober mum to him.'

Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder is an umbrella term describing disabilities and behavioural problems suffered by children as a result of their mother's drinking while pregnant.

There are no reliable figures for how many children and adults in the UK have it.

But some experts say one in every 250 babies is born with it – more than 3,000 in this country a year.

Children tend to suffer behavioural problems such as hyperactivity, learning difficulties and epilepsy.

They also often have distinct physical features including a flat face, snub nose and widely spaced eyes. The severity of the problem usually depends on how much their mother drank – but it will remain with them for the rest of their lives.

The disorder is caused by alcohol flowing through the placenta into the foetus and damaging cells in the brain and spinal cord.

Some studies have found that the alcohol causes most harm during the early stages of pregnancy when these organs are developing. The NHS advises women not to drink any alcohol during pregnancy but, if they must, to limit themselves to one to two units once or twice a week, and never get drunk.

But figures show that only half of all pregnant women give up alcohol completely during pregnancy and most do not cause their babies any harm.

Some experts say the condition is triggered by a complex range of factors including genes, a mother's age and her diet – as well as alcohol.
