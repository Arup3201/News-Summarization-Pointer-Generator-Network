Tell all: Sharon Savoy has written a book about her life as a professional ballroom dancer

On the popular BBC series Strictly Come Dancing, the professional dancers and their celebrity partners are often seen to become the best of friends, supporting one another throughout the competition.

The reality of competing on the ballroom dance circuit is somewhat different, according to three times world champion, Sharon Savoy, who is lifting the lift on the sequin-filled world in a new book.

She told MailOnline: 'It's a competition, not a performance.
 So the normal tension and rivalries are heightened. It is rare to 
develop a true friendship with your competitors, like you would see in a
 dance company.

'Backstage is an interesting dichotomy. Beneath the 
seemingly calm and composed exterior is a cauldron bubbling with nerves,
 anxious tension and pent up energy. Most of the dancers pace until 
their event is called and remind me of the energy of thoroughbred horses
 at the starting gate.'

Chicago-born Sharon, who trained at the School of American Ballet, said despite the fierce rivalry, attempts to sabotage the performance of a fellow competitor are thankfully rare.

'I have never heard of anything so 
terrible and tragic as the acid incident at the Bolshoi,' she said, referring to the time in 2013 when tensions at Russia's rival ballet companies turned violent and dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko threw acid on the face of artistic director, Sergei Filin.

Sharon said a dancers' worst enemy can often be the judge, rather than their competitor, as 'politics' means the best performer doesn't necessarily win.

'Many
 talented ballroom dancers leave the competition circuit when they tire 
of the politics. My book speaks about the politics in ballroom dance, 
which has been a taboo subject. Anytime you 
have a decision based on human opinion there will be controversy,' she said.

'The 
winner of a ballroom competition is not defined by who crosses the 
finish line first. What opens the door for "politics" to exist in 
ballroom dance competitions is the fact that our current system allows 
the coaches to also judge. It would be akin to allowing a barrister to 
also preside as judge of a legal case.'

Champ: Sharon, performing one of her routines, has won national and international titles

Politics aside, Sharon said she loves every aspect of the dance world - but success has not been easy. She's worked hard to become a U.S. and World champion, making sacrifices along the way.

'To become a top ranked professional 
ballroom dancer, you must live, breath, eat dance 24/7,' she explained. 'Nothing else 
can matter more, not relationships, family or comforts. Your passion 
must be all consuming and borderline obsessive to make it through the 
eye of the needle.

'George Balanchine, one of my early mentors, and 
director of the New York City ballet said it best, "I don't want dancers
 who want to dance, I want dancers that need to dance."'

But Sharon said the sacrifices are worth it to reap the rewards of being a professional ballroom dancer.

'The lifestyle of a top ranked ballroom 
dancer is a page out of the "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous",' she said. 'If you "make it" and become the champion, you travel all over the world to 
compete, perform and teach. It's a very glamorous way to see the world 
and get paid to do what you love most - dance!

Glamorous: The dancer, pictured in her youth, said she never gets tired of the sequins or elaborate make-up

'I have had the pleasure to
 perform in China, Japan, Taiwan, Russia, Australia, North and South 
America, Europe, The Royal Albert Hall and in Hollywood movies.'

Of course, the make-up and outfits all add to the glamour and Sharon said as a professional dancer, you can never have too much sparkle, tassles or fake tan.

'There's a saying that "you can never be too rich or too thin" - in the ballroom dance world, you can never be too tan!' she joked.

She added: 'Hair color is usually extreme - platinum blonde, flaming red or jet black. Make-up is exaggerated; eyelashes, eyebrows and lips are all accentuated. In a sea of competitors it's important to stand out and be the most exotic or colourful fish.'

As for the costumes, they are always 'exquisite'.

Political: Sharon said being the best dancer doesn't always guarantee victory

'The amount of time and attention to detail that goes into designing these lavish creations is similar to the fashion world's obsession with every facet of a piece of clothing,' she said.Â 

As well as looking lavish, the costumes must allow the performers to have freedom to move.

Sharon says she never gets fed up of the sparkly costumes or make-up that are necessary for a ballroom or Latin dance routine.

'It's part of the fun and fantasy - to become larger than life, to be sexier or more provocative or more elegant than you can be in normal daily life,' she said.
