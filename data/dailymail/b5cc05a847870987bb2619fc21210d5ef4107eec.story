Ricky Hatton was left stunned when he came across Luis Vuitton's range of boxing equipment - and at £69,000 for a punch bag, who can blame him?

The former world champion posted a picture of an advert for the kit on Twitter, along with the message: 'The world's gone f***ing mad.'

Of course, no punch bag is complete without a pair of gloves which are included with the bag but would set you back £3,700 if bought separately.

Louis Vuitton have produced a range of boxing equipment, including the trunk (left) and a pair of gloves

The bag, which is housed in a trunk, is custom made and takes between six and 12 months to build having been designed by the renowned German Karl Lagerfeld.

It boasts an aged cowhide leather trim with golden-brass hardware and includes four inside compartments and two zipped pockets. 

With the bag removed and attached to its stand, the trunk can be used as a travel closet.

One man who wouldn't think twice about splashing the cash is Floyd Mayweather Jnr.

The pound-for-pound king earned £65million from his fights with Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez and his first with Marcos Maidana.
