Ryanair has long been accused of a creative approach to geography when it comes to some of the European cities it claims to fly to.

So it was inevitable that the budget airline would swiftly become the subject of mockery when a highly imaginative route map from its in-flight magazine Let’s Go came to light.

According to the map, Manchester appears to have decamped 75 miles up the M6 to the fringes of the Lake District, while Leeds has also headed north and Newcastle-upon-Tyne is practically in Scotland.

The map in Ryanair's in-flight magazine seems to have taken a creative approach to some UK city locations

Cities in the Midlands and the south of England have largely been plotted more accurately.

But matters are even stranger north of the border, where both Glasgow and Edinburgh are located somewhere near Dundee.

Most bizarre of all is in the Irish airline’s native country where Dublin is provocatively placed slap-bang on the border with Northern Ireland - around 50 miles away from its actual location.

The curious interpretation was spotted by passengers leafing through the Let’s Go magazine handed out on Ryanair flights.

It swiftly drew derision on Twitter, with some wryly pointing out that it is not the first time the airline has been accused of sending passengers miles away from where they expected to be.

Twitter users jumped at the chance to poke fun at the budget airline for its  creative approach to geography

Others questioned whether the map was actually the creative handiwork of an outside agency

One Twitter user, Jamie Lawrence, said: ‘Perhaps this explains why Ryanair flights always land a few hours away from your destination.’

Ron Angeles wrote: ‘There’s something so very appropriate over fact that Ryanair in-flight magazine can’t properly locate most airports.’

Most infamously, Ryanair’s flights to Frankfurt actually land at the former ex-US Air Force base Frankfurt-Hahn which is 75 miles or nearly an hour and a half’s drive from the city itself – closer to Luxembourg, in fact.

The budget airline became infamous for flying to airports outside of the cities that it advertised

They also came under fire in 2012 for launching a service to an airfield in the Champagne region of France billed as Paris-Vatry-Disney when it is 70 miles from Disneyland Paris and 90 miles from the French capital.

Stelios Haji-Ioannou, founder of easyJet, once described the carrier as flying from 'nowhere to nowhere'.

Responding to the cities blunder yesterday, a spokesman for Ryanair made light of the glitch, saying: ‘We fly to so many airports (189 across Europe), we can barely fit them on the same page, never mind the same map.’

The airline insists it has moved on from its reputation for obscure destinations, saying it is flying to more ‘primary’ airports than ever with Athens, Lisbon and Glasgow International among those added over the past 12 months.
