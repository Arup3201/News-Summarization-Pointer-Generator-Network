Oscar-winning screenwriter Aaron Sorkin claimed that he had no idea who Michael Fassbender was according to the latest tranche of embarrassing emails leaked as part of the Sony cyber-hacking scandal. 

The emails reveal, however, that others at Sony were aware of the actor - or at least the size of his manhood - with producer Michael De Luca allegedly claiming in one email that the star, 'makes you feel bad to have normal sized male genitalia.'

The actor gained notoriety after playing Brandon Sullivan in 2011’s sexual exploration movie Shame and appearing in a full-frontal nude scene that revealed an impressive appendage. 

The latest leaks concern Sony’s failed attempts to make a movie about the life of Apple co-funder Steve Jobs, which Sorkin was adapting from Walter Isaacson’s biography.

The emails reveal Sorkin’s attempt to lobby for Tom Cruise to take the lead role and reveal his initial disdain when informed that Fassbender, Oscar-nominated for 12 Years A Slave, was favored for the role.

Academy Award-winning screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and actor Michael Fassbender are the latest Hollywood stars to be embarrassed by information leaked after a massive cyber attack at Sony Pictures

‘I don't know who Michael Fassbender is and the rest of the world isn't going to care,’ was his sniffy reply to Columbia Pictures Chairman Amy Pascal and movie producer Scott Rudin.

It was Rudin who called Angelina Jolie a 'minimally talented spoiled brat' in another email, while the latest leak of documents by the group calling themselves ‘the Guardians of Peace,’ are from Pascal’s email box.

Her exchanges with Rudin and Sorkin reveal that an extensive list of Hollywood big hitters had been considered for the Jobs role. 

After Leonardo Di Caprio turned it down, Christian Bale was mentioned, but email exchanges show Sorkin only had eyes for Cruise.

When Pascal sent Sorkin a message to say that director Danny Boyle ‘seems committed to’ Fassbender, he wasn't best pleased.

'This used to be an event. I don't know who Michael Fassbender is and the rest of the world isn't going to care. This is insane,' he wrote.

Jolie felt the ire of several Sony execs over her desire to star in a remake of Cleopatra 

However Sorkin eventually came round to the idea of Fassbender and wrote, 'F*** it. He's a great actor whose time has come.'

'That’s where I ended up,' Pascal replied.

'Yeah, if the movie’s good, he’ll be on the cover of everything and get nominated for everything,' Sorkin conceded.

Sony producer Michael De Luca chimed in with one email adding that the star, 'makes you feel bad to have normal sized male genitalia'.

Fassbender has previously admitted his naked appearance in Shame prompted many of his Hollywood friends– such as George Clooney, Sarah Silverman and Charlize Theron - to joke about his appendage.

In an interview with the UK issue of ELLE magazine, he once said: ‘I can’t start saying, ‘Wait a second there is more about the film than my d**k; it’s one scene and it doesn’t go on for very long’.’

Not long after the email exchanges, Sony's attempt to make the Jobs movie collapsed and the script was picked up by rivals Universal.

The leaking of sensitive  internal emails continues to be a source of embarrassment for Sony, which has announced that it isn’t taking any chances with the red-carpet premiere of The Interview on Thursday. 

The comedy, slated for U.S. release on December 25, stars Seth Rogen and James Franco as a producer and television host tasked with assassinating North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

The film has caused great anger in North Korea and there is much speculation that the country is behind the massive cyber attack at Sony and now the studio has announced that the movie's stars won’t be available to interview.

Sony Pictures said on Wednesday that no broadcast media will be invited to cover the film's gala opening in Los Angeles and no interviews will be granted to print reporters at the screening.

A Sony spokeswoman refused to comment on the reason for the premiere's coverage restrictions.

The studio is also adding extra security for Thursday’s event.

'Security is always a concern at premieres, and this is certainly no different,' a Sony official told Deadline. 'We will have appropriate security at the premiere.'

According to the LAPD, four off-duty officers have been added to the security team for the premiere at the Ace Hotel’s palatial theater in downtown Los Angeles.

The studio also cancelled a Los Angeles press day that had been planned for this week and said a press day in New York next week may not take place.

The cyber attack launched on Nov. 24 shut down Sony's computer network and exposed company secrets. 

Among them were e-mails that revealed Sony Corp Chief Executive Kazuo Hirai ordered The Interview be toned down after North Korea complained. 

The e-mail exchanges concerning Jolie claim she was displeased to learn that David Fincher was going to be directing the Jobs biopic rather than her re-make of Cleopatra. 

Rudin referred to Jolie as 'a minimally talented spoiled brat' before viciously slamming her in multiple e-mails.

'[Jolie] is upset about us giving david jobs she wants to talk,' Pascal, 56, told Rudin in a leaked e-mail dated February 27.

Over a series of email, Rudin, left, and Pascal, right, slam Angelina Jolie and her desire to have David Fincher direct her remake of Cleopatra 

But he apparently had no interest in discussing the matter with the Maleficent star, saying, 'She’ll survive it. I don’t want to waste my time on this.'

Later that day, he appears to have sent another e-mail to Pascal, which read, ‘YOU BETTER SHUT ANGIE DOWN BEFORE SHE MAKES IT VERY HARD FOR DAVID TO DO JOBS.’

She appears to respond with, 'Do not f**king threaten me.'

Rudin then proceeds to criticize Jolie with a number of cutting remarks and slams the idea of the movie altogether.

'There is no movie of Cleopatra to be made (and how that is a bad thing and rampaging spoiled ego of this woman and the cost of the movie is beyond me) and if you won’t tell her that you do not like the script — which, let me remind you, SHE DOESN’T EITHER — this will just spin even further out in Crazyland but let me tell you I have zero appetite for the indulgence of spoiled brats and I will tell her this myself if you don’t.'
