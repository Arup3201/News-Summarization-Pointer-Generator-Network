A man has been charged with attempted murder and armed robbery after he fled from a siege in south-east Queensland and stole a Channel Seven news car before crashing into a service station and surrendering to police.

Jordy Brook, 45, was charged with attempted murder, armed robbery, unlawful possession of a handgun and dangerous operation of a motor vehicle on Thursday afternoon. He will appear in court on Friday.

Cameraman Peter Steer, who Mr Brook stopped and turned his gun on before making off with Mr Steer's car, claims police took about 30 minutes to respond to his two triple-0 calls, the Courier Mail reported.

Seven News cameraman Peter Steer, who was on his way to cover the siege, said a man on a motorbike stopped him and said 'I'm the shooter'

But police say it took 12 minutes for officers to arrive on the scene at the petrol station.

Police were called to a Noosa Heads home at about 4.30am on Thursday when neighbours heard a gunshot. When they arrived they heard a man making threats to a woman inside.

The man then made a break for it on a motorbike, police say, before allegedly stealing the news car and crashing it into a petrol station.

His partner was taken to hospital with head and neck injuries.

Cameraman Mr Steer, who was on his way to cover the incident, said a man on a motorbike stopped him and pulled out a weapon. 

'He got off his bike and approached me and said "I've got a story for you". I said "Well mate, you better hurry because I'm going to a shooting", and he said "Mate, I'm the shooter."'

Mr Steer talked to the man and kept him calm, and the man handed Mr Steer his pistol and said he wanted to hand himself to police before breaking down in tears.

But before he knew it, the man had taken back the pistol and aimed it back at Steer before taking off in his car, which can also be seen in the Seven footage. 

Steer recounted the experience to Seven News on Thursday evening and told the program: 'It was unexpected, up until that point I'd felt fairly secure knowing that the police I'd called were on their way.' 

The man is surrounded by police, who point their weapons towards him and shout for him to get down

'When I saw him reach for the passenger side of the vehicle and reach for the gun ... it did sort of ring a few alarm bells in my head.'

From there Mr Steer kept the camera rolling out of instinct, saying he weighed up whether he would keep shooting or or get out of the line of fire. 

Mr Steer then managed to track him down and capture footage at a Eumundi service station where he crashed into a petrol tank and is cornered by police.

Officers can be seen pointing their guns toward the man, who they specifically instruct to 'move away' and 'get back'.

'I got to a little town called 'mundi and a chap on a Harley (Davidson) sort of pulled me over, I thought there might have been something wrong with my car,' Mr Steer told Sunrise.

Witness Cavan Herron, 33, from Doonan, said the man looked like a 'bikie'.

Mr Herron, a welder, was driving to work when he passed the scene unfolding between the cameraman and the gunman but he thought they were filming a TV show.

'As I was driving past I noticed there was a cameraman and a really quite flash nice-looking bike,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'I thought they were about to start filming or something, I thought it was a documentary, then I didn't think anything of it.

'He looked like a bikie, he had a big beard and everything, just like a standard bikie basically.'

Police lost track of the man in the car, but a short time later they were called to a gas leak at a nearby service station.

Officers found the stolen car had crashed there and arrested the man.

He was taken to hospital and spent time in the emergency department, before being discharged into police custody.
