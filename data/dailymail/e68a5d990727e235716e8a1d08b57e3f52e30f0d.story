Politicians in Westminster spend a lot of time arguing about the need for cuts, and their value but now the barbershop has become the latest battleground.

After it emerged David Cameron pays £90 for a trim from the stylist who has just received an MBE, Nick Clegg boasted of paying just £20 while Labour's Chris Bryant said he parted with only £13.

But now it can be revealed that cash-conscious Eric Pickles, who regularly warns councils they must trim their spending, cuts his own hair at home for free.

Bargain barnet: Communities Secretary Eric Pickles does not splash the cash on his hair, preferring to trim what's left using clipper himself at home

While Margaret Thatcher once had 120 appointments with her stylist in a single year, all of those currently arguing about their hair cut costs seem to be men.

The cost of looking like a modern 
statesman seems to vary widely, from £90 for the Prime Minister to just 
£13 for a Labour frontbencher.

But Communities Secretary Mr Pickles, who has demanded cuts across local government in the age of austerity, settles for a DIY job.

A source close to the thrifty minister said: 'He trims what is left of it himself with clippers.'

The interest in political haircuts was sparked by the revelation that David Cameron's stylist Lino Carbosiero was awarded an MBE in the New Year's honours list, 
prompting accusations of cronyism.

Facing the chop: Nick Clegg revealed he often gets his hair cut at Jam in Sheffield

It was reported that a trim from the crimper to the stars cost Mr Cameron £90-a-time, and raised questions about Carbosier's role in disguising the PM's much-rumoured bald spot. 

Mr Carbosiero - whose clients include 
Kylie Minogue, Sir Paul McCartney and Dustin Hoffman - cuts hair at the 
prestigious Daniel Galvin salon in central London.

When questioned on
 Sky News about the Prime Minister's apparent bald patch, Mr Carbosiero 
showed laudable discretion, replied diplomatically: 'What bald spot?'

While
 the interest in such trivial matters left Downing Street strategists 
pulling their hair out, other politicians seized the chance to prove 
their were more in touch with the ordinary man in the street by boasting
 how they pay much less for their short-back-and-sides.

Commons Leader Andrew Lansley (left) boasted of paying £15 for a trim, less than the Lib Dems but he was beaten by Labour's Chris Bryant who parts with only £13

Labour's shadow welfare minister Chris Bryant revealed he pays only £13 for a hair cut

Local; cuts: Tory Cabinet minister Andrew Lansley is a regular at Mr Polito's Barber Shop in Cambridge where he is an MP

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg revealed on his LBC 97.3 radio phone-in that he had his haircut by Christian at Jam Hairdressing in Sheffield, where it cost £20.

He
 said: 'The last time I got my haircut was in Sheffield, in my 
constituency, where haircuts are considerably cheaper than in London.

'But I do pay more when I get my hair cut in London, at a 
barbers/hairdressers just off Victoria Street.'

Ed Miliband does not have a regular hairdresser, sources close to the Labour leader revealed.

'He often goes to a local barbers, sometimes he has people who come into the office. He does not have a set amount which he pays for his hair,' the source added.

Critics have asked why Lino Carbosiero (left), responsible for the PM's side parting (right), was given an MBE

Mr Cameron's changing hairstyle has often been the topic of much discussion in sketchwriters' columns. Mr Carbosiero is believed to be responsible for the Prime Minister's decision to change his parting from the right to the left in 2007

The
 decision to move his parting from the right to the left in 2007 sparked
 claims he was attempting to look more 'butch' or cover up a receding 
hairline

Labour's shadow welfare minister Chris Bryant wrote on Twitter: 'My last haircut cost £13.'

The issues was then raised in the House of Commons. Labour frontbencher Angela Eagle questioned whether the hairdresser to Commons leader Andrew Lansley should also have been given a gong.

She said: 'I cannot help wondering, given his appearance today, whether his hairdresser feels somewhat left out - perhaps it is an easier job with hair like his.'

In response, Mr Lansley showed off his silver locks to the public gallery, before telling MPs: 'When I visit Mr Polito’s in Cambridge, as I perhaps will this weekend, he will be able to advise me.

'Mr Polito’s is not a person but a shop. Actually, it costs £15, so I am getting my hair cut cheaper than the Deputy Prime Minister, which just shows that you can come to the Conservatives for value for money.'

The revelations about the cost of haircuts has so far focused solely on men.

By comparison, last week it emerged that when Mrs Thatcher was Prime Minister she had 120 appointments with a hairdresser in 1984 - an average of once every three days,
