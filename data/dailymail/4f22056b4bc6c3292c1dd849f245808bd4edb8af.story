A Canada teen baseball player was booted from his team on Wednesday by a coach who simply didn't like the long head of hair he was growing to donate to cancer victims.

Liam Nazarek, 16, of Pincher Creek, Alberta was told by coach Bryan Mackenzie that he could either sit out the season or cut his long brown locks.

The teen's mom caught the coach making his announcement in video footage that has since gone viral as supportive social media users spread the word about the callous power play.

Unfair: Liam Nazarek, 16, was booted from his Canada town's baseball team by a coach who hated the hair he was growing out to donate to child cancer patients

'We've come to a decision,' says the hollow-voiced Mackenzie in the sneaky footage.

'Hair is not a rule in baseball,' Liam's mom Kimberly Jorgenson pleads to the unmoved coach.

'It is for me,' replied Mackenzie.

Mackenzie doesn't even budge after he's told that Liam's growing his hair for a cancer charity, a cause very close to his young heart.

'I said it's an admirable cause (cancer),' he tells Liam. 'I'm not going to say it was going to make any difference.'

The interaction becomes heated as Jorgensen continues to support her son.

'You want to coach,' barks the coach. 'There's the team. Kim, do you want to coach?'

Mackenzie was was anything but accepting when he told the mother and son to simply 'accept it.'

Caught: Mackenzie made his decision and told Liam and his mother Kimberly Jorgensen, who slyly caught the interaction on video

Heated: In just days, the video--in which the confrontation becomes heated as the mom defends her son--was shared thousands of times after Jorgensen posted it to Facebook

However, Jorgensen was not content to accept it. She posted her video to Facebook on Thursday, the day after her son gamely chose to spend the previous night sitting in the dugout to support his teammates.

By Sunday, news of his unfortunate plight had spread to millions after the Facebook video was shared thousands of of times.

'You need to be respectful of your coach. You need to be respectful of the rules of the game. I don't think your hair has anything to do with that,' Jorgensen told CBC News.

She clarified in her interview with the paper that Liam was not kicked off technically but will not be allowed to play unless he cuts his hair.

Despite Mackenzie taking social media heat from across not only his own country but in the neighboring U.S., the league has come out in support of him while managing to villianize Jorgensen.

'The parent in this situation,' the league wrote in a statement, 'manipulated the the situation using social media. This is totally unacceptable if not only because it sets a terrible example for our children. There was no respect in this situation whatsoever.'

In response to the decision, a nearby town has offered to let Liam join their baseball team.

While he hasn't decided whether or not he will take them up on the offer, the positive feedback he's getting from across the web is certain to help cheer him up.
