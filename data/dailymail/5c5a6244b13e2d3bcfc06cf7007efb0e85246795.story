A plumber has died and a family taken to hospital from a block of flats which was evacuated because of chemical fumes. 

The man was believed to have suffered an electric shock and was pronounced dead at the scene. 

He is understood to have been unblocking a sink using a drain cleaning fluid when the tragedy happened on the fourth floor of the flat on New Year's Day. 

Residents said a small 'explosion' took place when the plumber - who has not been named - poured the fluid down a drain. 

A plumber died on the fourth floor of this block of flats at Boulter House in New Cross, south east London

London Fire Brigade said around 100 people were evacuated from Boulter House in New Cross, south east London, by the emergency services as a precaution because of the smell of chemicals.

People in the flat spent several hours sitting on a night bus which had been pulled over by police to give residents shelter. 

The plumber is not believed to be a resident, but a Nigerian couple and their three children who live in the flat were all taken to hospital. 

An LFB spokesman said: 'A woman and three children from the flat involved were taken to hospital by London Ambulance Service suffering from the effects of the fumes.

'Two men who were in the flat at the time are also believed to have suffered a possible electric shock. One of them, also affected by fumes, was taken to hospital, but sadly the other man was pronounced dead at the scene.'

Yohannes Berhe, 33, a cleaner, who lives next door to the flat, said the son of the couple had been knocking on his door for help.

Mr Berhe said: 'I came home around 9:30pm and the eldest boy, he's 14, was really distressed and he said "my dad and my mum and the engineer - they've had an accident and they're all lying on the floor".

'He was holding his mobile phone and so I rang the ambulance for him. They told us to stay outside so I took the children and looked after them until the ambulance came.

'The plumber had poured some acid or solution down the drain because the sink was blocked. I think that must have caused an explosion somehow. The kitchen light exploded.

'From what I can make out, the plumber was shocked and the man who lives there touched him to see if he was OK and was shocked himself. Then the same thing happened to the lady too, I think.'

He said he could see the emergency services rushing to the aid of the Nigerian man, adding: 'It looked like they were pumping his chest in the back of the ambulance.

'The mother was vomiting a lot in the back of the ambulance. The children were also taken to hospital.'  

Yohannes Berhe (pictured), 33, a cleaner, who lives next door to the flat, said there was an 'explosion'  - because he was outside with the couple's children when the building was evacuated but had left his light on, the fire brigade smashed his front window (pictured) to check no body was in 

Another resident, who asked not to be named, said: 'We were on the bus until around 2am, but the police made sure we stayed calm.

'After a while, when they had taken everybody's name and address on the bus, they told us there could be a problem with gas and we wouldn't be allowed back until they knew it was safe.' 

Residents were eventually allowed to return to their flats at around 4.30am. 

Boulter House resident, Raynold Dove, 47, said: 'It was like a disaster movie, there were fire engines, ambulances, and police all around the flats. I counted six fire engines and five ambulances. I thought the end of the world was coming, or something. It was crazy, absolutely crazy.

'We weren't aware at all what was happening. We just got put on a night bus and didn't really know why we were being evacuated.' 

London Ambulance Service (LAS) said paramedics were called at 9:49pm.

An LAS spokesman said: ' 'We sent a number of resources to the scene including an advanced paramedic, the hazardous area response team and a tactical advisor.

'A man reported to be in his fifties, a woman reported to be in her forties and three children were all taken to Kings College Hospital as a priority. 

'Sadly, despite extensive efforts to resuscitate the patient, a man was dead at the scene.'  

A Metropolitan Police spokeswoman said officers were called to the flat shortly after 10pm and that the incident was not believed to be suspicious. She added that the Health and Safety Executive had been informed.

The building is managed by Lewisham Homes. However, the flat the Nigerian family live in is a leasehold property.

The social housing provider described the incident as 'terrible' and said it was providing support to police to help their investigations.

A Lewisham Homes spokesman said: 'Our thoughts are with the families involved in the terrible incident at a leasehold property in New Cross on Thursday night.

'We are providing support to the police to ensure the property is safe to enter while investigations are carried out.'
