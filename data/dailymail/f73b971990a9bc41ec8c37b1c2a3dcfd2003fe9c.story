Louis van Gaal has taken the first steps to streamline his Manchester United squad after holding talks with six players, including right back Rafael.

Marouane Fellaini, Wilfried Zaha, Nani, Shinji Kagawa and young striker Will Keane also had time alone with Van Gaal at United’s Carrington training complex on Saturday afternoon.

It is understood the Dutch coach told Fellaini, Zaha, Nani and Keane that the club will listen to offers for them.

Rafael, a surprise name on the list, could also find himself pushed out as United search for another right back. Kagawa will have a role but is behind Ander Herrera and Juan Mata and in the pecking order.

Midfielder Anderson and striker Javier Hernandez already know that United will listen if bids come in. Southampton, Inter Milan, Tottenham, Atletico Madrid and Juventus have all shown interest in the Mexican, while Napoli would take Fellaini — providing the deal is subsidised by United.

Newcastle lead the interest in Zaha, with Crystal Palace, West Ham and Nottingham Forest also keen.

Cardiff City have asked to take Keane’s twin, defender Michael, on loan but United want to recruit before sanctioning the deal.

United seek two new defenders after failing to land Arsenal’s Thomas Vermaelen who joined Barcelona yesterday for an initial £8million plus £7.1m in possible add-ons.
