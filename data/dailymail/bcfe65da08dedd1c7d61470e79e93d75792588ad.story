A third grader who was giving an anti-violence speech in New Jersey on Saturday was left stunned when the sound of gunshots rang out in the middle of his message.

Nyeeam Hudson, 8, was speaking to a crowd of people in a basement on Prince Street, New Jersey when a loud popping sound of gunshots occurred behind him.

His speech was dedicated to ways that ongoing violence in New Jersey could be stamped out and he urged the crowd to remain ‘thankful’ despite a spate of murders in the area.

Speech: Nyeeam Hudson, 8, was speaking to a crowd of people in a basement on Prince Street, New Jersey

Shock: The third grader stopped his speech to look behind him after the noise startled everyone in the room 

But as the sound of gunshots rattled off loudly, the youth, who appears to be wise beyond his years, immediately spun around to try and identify what exactly had taken place outside.

Police later confirmed that a man had been shot multiple times on the 100th block of Prince Street. 

The 23-year-old man, was found alive, clinging to life, but was pronounced dead at University Hospital nearby  shortly after.

Anthony Ambrose, chief of detectives for the Essex County Prosecutor's Office said in a statement that no arrests had been made in the shooting, and an investigation is ongoing. 

He also confirmed that detectives recovered seven 7.62-millimeter shell casings at the scene. 

Location: Police later confirmed that a man had been shot multiple times on the 100th block of Prince Street.

The third-grader was one of several poets and artists speaking at ‘Poetry on the Move’ a program put on by non-profit organization FP YouthOutCry Foundation, Inc. and local Mayor Ras Baraka.

The organization is dedicated to empowering youth to stay away from violence and aims to provide a safe haven for children and teens in New Jersey through arts classes and other activities.

Susan Schessler, Director of Development for the foundation told NJ.com: 'It wasn’t what people describe as firecracker, ‘pop pop pop.’

'It sounded like a fence falling. It was a loud sustained noise, and then it was over.’

The timing of the shooting was particularly poignant for everyone who had gathered in the  organization’s clubhouse known as the HUBB.

The murder marks the city's 70th so far this year and the third of the week, according to authorities. 

Others present included representatives from Baraka’s Division of Arts, Cultural Development and Tourism.

Al-Tariq Best, founder of FP YouthOutCry posted a video of the incident on the organization’s Facebook page.  

Organizer: Al-Tariq Best bemoaned the lack of media presence for the initial poetry event 

The video included a message bemoaning the media presence for the initial poetry event which had gone unnoticed until there was a shooting.

He said: ‘Guess what? They came out today, because a young boy’s life was ended, on Prince Street.'

Future leader: ‘As I was speaking about violence, violence happened, and I think as a people we can do better' Hudson said

‘While the youth was expressing itself, we heard the shots of a youth taken away.’

Schessler added: ‘It was very powerful, because the kid was really talking about the simplicity of life and being happy with what we have, and that violence is turning people’s heads and destroying lives. 

'And then we hear this barrage of gunshots. It was such a stark contrast.’

The group decided to soldier on with their anti violence message, despite the murder taking place.

Schessler said: ‘It would be contrary to the spirit of the HUBB, because that’s the whole purpose, is to bring kids into another world, right in the midst of their violent world.'

Hudson said he did not initially realize the loud sounds that interrupted him were gunshots.

‘As I was speaking about violence, violence happened, and I think as a people we can do better,’ he said.
