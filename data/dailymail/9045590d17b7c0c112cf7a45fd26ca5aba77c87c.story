Selfridges is facing prosecution after a government watchdog found that it had put customers' health at risk by selling raw milk.

The department store has sold unpasteurised milk from vending machines at its flagship London store since 2011.

However, the Food Standards Agency said it is looking at prosecuting the store along with its supplier, Hook & Sons organic farm in East Sussex.

The watchdog said that selling unpasteurised milk in such a way breached food hygiene regulations.

'Raw' milk has historically been associated with the spread of tuberculosis and food poisoning bugs like salmonella.

Sales of the milk are outlawed in Scotland, with farmers allowed to sell the milk direct to the public at farm gates and markets across the rest of the UK.

Shops can also sell cheese made from the milk.

But the FSA said Selfridges and the farmer, Stephen Hook, of Longleys Farm, Hailsham, broke the rules by selling the milk in vending machines.

The watchdog said: ‘The FSA has 
confirmed its intention to prosecute Selfridges and the farmer who 
supplied the company with raw drinking cow milk for sale, Stephen Hook, 
for breaches of food hygiene regulations.

‘The
decision follows a detailed investigation, after vending machines 
dispensing raw cow milk were installed at Selfridges, in 2011.’

Selfridges said its original decision to sell the milk was driven by a desire to offer more choice to customers.

The farm company, Hook & Sons, sell their raw milk across the country via the internet, through London’s Borough Market and two milk rounds in Sussex.

It insists the milk is pure, hygienic, safe and better for people than the pasteurised product.

The firm said: ‘Herds are milked in a hygienic environment, using advanced milking equipment that is kept sterile. We pay fantastic attention to hygiene to ensure the strict bacteria tests conducted on the milk by the FSA are easily met.

‘In this way all the benefits of the good bacteria in the milk are kept, without having any of the problems associated with bad.’

Stephen Hook said: ‘It is regrettable that the FSA has decided to bring this test case against a small family farm, which we believe has in every respect complied with the strict regulations of the 2006 Act governing sales of unpasteurised milk in England.'

The company removed its machine from Selfridges last year following a complaint from the FSA.

However, Mr Hook said: ‘We have always maintained that the sale of raw milk through vending machines that are the property of the dairy producer and are maintained and stocked by him, is entirely within the spirit of the law. We are therefore determined to fight this prosecution.’

The FSA is consulting on whether there should be changes to the rules restricting sales of raw milk, which could bring an outright ban.
