Scientists say citalopram can significantly reduce the formation of plaques in the brain, which could go some way to warding off the disease

A widely-used antidepressant could help slow the onset of Alzheimer’s disease, researchers have found.

Scientists say citalopram can significantly reduce the formation of plaques in the brain, which could go some way to warding off the disease.

The U.S. academics admit it is too early to recommend the drug to Alzheimer’s patients, but dementia charities last night welcomed the ‘promising’ findings as providing ‘vital new clues’ about the disease.

Plaque deposits are closely associated with declining memory and other symptoms of Alzheimer’s, so anything that can stop their build-up in the brain is likely to help ward off the condition.

The research, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, found that a single dose of the antidepressant citalopram lowered production of the plaque protein amyloid beta by 37 per cent.

The experiment was conducted in healthy adults aged 18 to 50, but the scientists, from the universities of Washington and Pennsylvania, hope the findings can be replicated in elderly patients.

The drug, marketed in the UK as Cipramil, also had a dramatic effect on elderly mice, halting the growth of existing plaques and reducing the formation of new deposits by 78 per cent.

Lead scientist Dr John Cirrito, from Washington University School of Medicine said: ‘Antidepressants appear to be significantly reducing amyloid beta production, and that’s exciting.

'But while antidepressants generally are well tolerated, they have risks and side effects.

‘Until we can more definitively prove that these drugs help slow or stop Alzheimer’s in humans, the risks aren’t worth it. There is still much more work to do.’

The amyloid beta protein is a waste product of normal brain activity. But its levels rise in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients, causing it to clump together in plaques.

Earlier research by Dr Cirrito’s team showed that serotonin, a brain messenger chemical, reduces amyloid beta production.

Serotonin is also linked to mood, and many antidepressants work by keeping the neurotransmitter circulating in the brain

Serotonin is also linked to mood, and many antidepressants work by keeping the neurotransmitter circulating in the brain.

The scientists are now investigating how serotonin affects amyloid beta production in mice at the molecular level.

Co-author Dr Yvette Sheline, from the University of Pennsylvania, said: ‘We also plan to study older adults who will be treated for two weeks with antidepressants.

‘If we see a drop in levels of amyloid beta in their spinal fluid after two weeks, then we will know that this beneficial reduction in amyloid beta is sustainable.’

Dr Simon Ridley, head of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: ‘Amyloid build-up occurs many years before symptoms appear in Alzheimer’s, and understanding how to prevent or delay its accumulation early is a key goal for Alzheimer’s researchers.

‘This study has yielded some interesting findings, and further research to understand the mechanisms responsible for these results could provide vital new clues about the disease and how to fight it.

‘Currently half a million people in the UK are living with Alzheimer’s, the most common cause of dementia, and we urgently need treatments that can stop the disease in its tracks.

'Investment in research is crucial if we are to develop these treatments and provide better outcomes for people with the disease.’

Dr Doug Brown, director of research at the Alzheimer’s Society, added: ‘The fact that this anti-depressant has the ability to reduce the production of amyloid beta is promising, and it is encouraging to see the effects in mice replicated in people.

‘However, this was a small study in healthy people, so more research is needed to see if the drug could work for people with dementia, or even help prevent the condition developing in the first place.’

Citalopram is one of the most-commonly prescribed antidepressants in England, where 53million prescriptions of all antidepressants are issued a year, double the number prescribed a decade ago.

According to recent research, one in three British women and one in 10 men now take antidepressants, and doctors have been warned not to routinely prescribe the drugs.

While citalopram is not clinically addictive, some experts fear that people who take it as an antidepressant can become dependent on it.
