Despite 96 per cent of European travellers believing that airports should provide free wifi, just two of the UK's biggest are offering the service.

Birmingham and London City are the only airports offering holidaymakers unlimited usage to surf the net on their devices without a charge.  

Even though Heathrow claims the title of Europe's busiest airport, it fails to impress passengers by offering a measly 45 minutes free wifi, before charging £3 per hour.

UK airports: Birmingham and London City offer unlimited free wifi - while Heathrow charges the most

This is in stark contrast to Russia and Italy where all their main airports offer unlimited free access, as do almost half (48 per cent) of Europe's 50 busiest airports.

The survey also found that a third of travellers would only be prepared to pay £1 for an hour of wifi – significantly less than Dusseldorf and Lisbon Airports which are the most expensive in the study, charging £8 for two hours. 

Lisbon Airport is also the most expensive for one hour along with Brussels Airport, both of which charge £4 for an hour.

However all at least offer a limited period of free wifi, unlike Berlin's Tegel Airport and Turkey's Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen Airport, both of which offer passengers no free WiFi allowance at all.

The same survey found that 71 per cent of travellers felt free wifi was important or extremely important, with 10 per cent using it for social media, 22 per cent for checking emails and 30 per cent to pass time. 

But with this obvious demand for airport wifi and each airport's wifi offering differing so much, Skyscanner has compiled an infographic of airports and wifi charges.

Spokesman Mary Porter said: 'We know that airport wifi is an area of increasing importance for passengers.

'It can be very frustrating for passengers who want to check their emails or download a film ready for their flight, only to find they are subject to an excessive charge.

'We hope that this guide will help them to know what to expect at each airport they are travelling through, but will also encourage more airports to offer a more generous wifi allowance.'
