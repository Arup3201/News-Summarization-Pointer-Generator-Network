The Australian property market is in danger of 'overheating' and rising housing prices could jeopardise the country's economic and financial stability, top ratings agency Moody's has warned.

The New York-based ratings agency blamed low interest rates for fuelling rising house prices but said in a regular report on the Australian economy that the trend could not continue indefinitely.

'(This) trend poses some medium-term risks as Australia's real estate market appears to be overheating, with both price-to-income and price-to-rent ratios reaching levels well above the historical averages,' wrote Moody's analysts, Steven Hess and Bart Oosterveld.

'Considering supply-side constraints, the influx of foreign capital and the fact that monetary policy is set to remain accommodative for the foreseeable future, the housing market appears to be increasingly likely to get caught up in a positive price-feedback loop and eventually could face a correction.'

Housing prices continued to rise in the first quarter of 2014 as average year-over-year growth in Australia's eight largest cities inched up to 8.3 percent, marking the highest growth rate in nearly four years.

House prices in Sydney rose 16 per cent over the past year, while the Melbourne property market increased to 9.9 per cent, according to RP Data figures released last week.

The data revealed average prices for a property in Sydney was now $679,000 and Melbourne house prices are currently estimated to cost $555,000.

Moody's report acknowledged that any price fall in the property market would be contained by a lack of supply.

'In terms of volumes, however, rising housing prices have not so far resulted in a construction boom: residential construction activity remains largely in line with demand trends,' the report stated.

'This, along with still historically low leverage levels, strong mortgage buffers, and well-capitalised banking system, limits the impact of a potential real estate market contraction on the broader economy.'

Low interest rates and rising house prices have also led to a resurgence in Australia's renovation market.

The Housing Industry Association is expecting $28.6 billion to be spent on renovations after dropping to a decade low last year, leading to financial benefits for retailers and manufactures in the home renovation market. 

'After a slow start to the 2013/14 fiscal year, renovations investment has now posted two consecutive quarters of growth through to the March 2014 quarter,' the report stated.

'This provides some confidence for our forecast of 1.0 per cent growth in the total value of renovations investment in 2013/14 to around $28.6 billion.'

Growth predictions continue to rise after 2014 with 1.2 per cent, 2.3 per cent and 2.5 per cent increases expected over the following consecutive years.

If fulfilled, this trend would see a resurgence of the renovation boom experienced in 2013, around the $30 billion figure.
