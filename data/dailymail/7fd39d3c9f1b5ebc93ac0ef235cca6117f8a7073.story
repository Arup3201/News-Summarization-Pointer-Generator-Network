Julio Cu Camara's day job is dirty work. The 52-year-old spends his working days submerged in the murky liquid of Mexico City's sewers, clearing blockages and carrying out repairs by hand.

For 30 years, Cu Camara has made an average of four dives a month, staying below the surface for about 30 minutes to six hours at a time.

He wears an airtight suit and helmet that weigh about 90lb in total to protect him from the human, chemical and animal waste and its overpowering stench.

Cu Camara has encountered dead human bodies, horses and pigs as well as weapons and car parts while exploring a drainage system measuring about 7,456 miles long.

'I think the worst thing to find is a human being, because we’ve found bodies of people and we don’t know who they are,' he told Radio Netherlands in 2010.

'I’ve found everything from cigarette butts to bits of cars and trucks, big tyres, furniture, fridges, microwaves. 

'We find all of it in the sewers. You’ve got to ask yourself how it got there? But there it is – it’s crazy.'

'The most common problem is garbage. All of the city’s litter ends up here, in the drainage system and it obstructs the pumps, the metal grates, the hatches.'

The pipes and pumps that process waste water are repaired and unblocked by hand to save time but must be carried out in the dark because no light is strong enough to illuminate the pitch black sewage.

He makes four dives a month on average and can be submerged for about 30 minutes to six hours depending on the work needed

Cu Camara has made more than 1,400 trips 
below the surface but thankfully he gets a thorough hosing down when he 
surfaces from below.

While submerged, he talks to his support team through a helmet microphone.

He is the chief diver for the Federal District's sewerage system and the only remaining member of the original team.

Now, the married father-of-two is training up two young divers to follow in his wake.
