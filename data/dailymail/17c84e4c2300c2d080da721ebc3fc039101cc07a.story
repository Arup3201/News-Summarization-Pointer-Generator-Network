Barcelona forward Luis Suarez is pushing for selection against Real Madrid as his four-month ban for biting draws to a close.

The former Liverpool striker is yet to make a competitive appearance for the club he joined in the summer after being hit with a lengthy suspension for sinking his teeth into the shoulder of Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini during a World Cup group game.

But according to Spanish publications Mundo Deportivo and Sport, the 27-year-old is aiming to pull on Barca's famous strip against rivals Real on October 25 - the first match he will be eligible to play in.

Both newspapers claim that Suarez wants to play in  Uruguay's upcoming international friendlies - against Saudi Arabia on October 10 and Oman on October 13 - to improve his fitness ahead of the clash at the Bernabeu.

Elsewhere in Spain AS feature an interview with under pressure Los Blancos goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who admits that Real's fans are superb but they have also hurt him. 

The Spanish stopper also says he felt like 'the plague' and it appeared he was being forced out of the club in recent months following a run of poor form, while striker Karim Benzema has challenged himself, Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo to score 100 goals between them this season in Marca.

Over in Italy and the fallout from Juventus' controversial 3-2 victory against title rivals Roma continues across the main sports newspapers.

La Gazzetta dello Sport say their is a fever of 90 degrees surrounding the match and that action replays are the antivirus to future problems surrounding refereeing decisions.

Corriere dello Sport also lead on the clash between the Serie A giants with the headline 'Juve-Rome blow by blow', with Pavel Nedved claiming that Roma legend Francesco Totti has 'never been at a big club'.
