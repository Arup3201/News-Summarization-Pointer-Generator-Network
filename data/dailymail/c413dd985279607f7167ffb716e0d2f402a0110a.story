A bus carrying the Brazilian national football team has come under attack by protesters who hammered on on its sides while carrying placards protesting against the forthcoming World Cup.

The team, including stars such as Neymar, David Luiz and Hulk, were on their way to a training session in Rio de Janeiro when a large group of demonstrators blocked their path - covering the bus in stickers protesting the ever-growing cost of next month's tournament.

With the World Cup kicking off in Sao Paolo on June 12, there is increasing concern over how prepared Brazil is to play host, with rumours of violent protests over the coming weeks and stadiums and transport systems that are yet to even be completed, let alone tested.

Anger: Demonstrators carrying placards protesting against the forthcoming World Cup attacked a bus carrying the Brazilian national football team today

Fury: The demonstrators hammered on the side of the team bus and shouted anti-World Cup slogan

Concern: The team, including stars such as Neymar, David Luiz and Hulk, were on their way to a training session in Rio de Janeiro when the demonstrators blocked their path and covered the bus in stickers

Desperation: Protestors are against the money being spent by the government on the World Cup  

A banner reading: 'There will not be be a cup' was among those being carried by the protesters who bombarded the national team's bus.

Security is being beefed up around the country, with 157,000 soldiers and police assigned to keep order during the tournament.

Earlier, concerns were raised about how prepared Brazil is to host the World Cup.

An estimated 300,000 visitors are 
expected to arrive in Brazil to take in the month-long tournament, with 
matches taking place everywhere from the humid Amazon region in the 
north, to the south east coastal city of Rio de Janeiro, where the World Cup final will be held.

Ahead of the tournament kicking off in three weeks time, there is concern 
the country may not be ready, with testing not finished on many 
stadiums, and transport projects well behind schedule.

Concern: Building work is still going on at the Beira Rio stadium in Porto Alegre

A
 fresh wave of protests are expected against the billions shelled out by
 the government to host the event - although the authorities don't 
anticipate demonstrations as intense as those seen last year

Some police officers have sought to use security worries over the World Cup to pressure for pay raises, staging strikes that brought looting and other chaos.

Alongside the security concerns, many are worried that the basic infrastructure in place could cause serious problems, not least because a number of stadiums remain untested, some bus lanes and airports appear unfinished.

Everywhere you look: The World Cup seems to be on everyone's mind as residents of cities around Brazil paint walls with football-inspired graffiti

Anti-World Cup graffiti on the streets of Rio de Janeiro reads: 'Less weapons, Less jails, more schools, peace, more health and demilitarization'

High hopes: Brazil legend Ronaldo has said he is 'embarrassed' about the chaos coming from his country

With such a large number of fans, players and officials trying to get around the country on tight deadlines, the transport issues are highly significant, while matches played in stadiums that have never before hosted football matches at full capacity have raised serious safety concerns.

Brazil legend Ronaldo is just one of those who has voiced his embarrassment over the problems.

'In 2007 when they decided that the World Cup would be in Brazil, President Lula signed everything and agreed to everything and then they get here and there’s this bureaucracy, total confusion and lateness,' he said.

'It’s a shame. I am embarrassed, this is my country and I love it and we shouldn’t be transmitting this image abroad,' he added.

'But we mustn’t forget that Brazil wasn’t perfect before the World Cup. It was the same or worse,' Ronaldo went on to say.

Ronaldo, who as a member of the Local Organising Committee is one of the most visible backers of soccer's world governing body FIFA and the Brazilian government, said Brazil has always faced problems of 'corruption, embezzlement, overcharging'.

He lamented the late delivery of stadiums, three of which are still not ready.

The World Cup seems to be on 
everyone's mind as residents of cities around Brazil paint walls with football-inspired graffiti - some of it welcoming the tournament, some of 
it complaining about the cost.
