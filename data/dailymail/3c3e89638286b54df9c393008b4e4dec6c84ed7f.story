It's a tradition that has thrilled generations of children.

But these days even an event as harmless and wholesome as the Shrove Tuesday pancake race is affected by health and safety rules.

In Leeds yesterday, numerous school children were dressed in fluorescent high-visibility jackets to flip pancakes around the precincts of the newly designated Minster church.

The youngsters from St Peter’s Church of England Primary School must wear the bright safety clothing on all excursions outside the school.

Four years ago a similar pancake race near the Cathedral in Ripon, North Yorkshire, was called off due to health and safety concerns.

Problems over the huge amount of risk assessment paperwork and insurance requirements for the public event led to it being cancelled.

But it was revived the following year after churchmen and festival officials were given guidance on how to cut through some of the form-filling.

Since then the races have gone from strength to strength. Bernard Bateman, local festival organiser, said after yesterday’s race involving 140 children: ‘Everyone thoroughly enjoyed it and there were no accidents. I will be glad when the Government reduces health and safety which I understand it is going to do anyway. It is quite onerous.’

Pancake races are held all over the country on Shrove Tuesday – the traditional feast before the start of Lent.

Historically it was seen as the last opportunity to use up eggs and milk before the Lent fast. The oldest race takes place at Olney, Buckinghamshire.

According to tradition, in 1445 a woman of Olney heard the shriving bell while she was making pancakes and ran to the church in her apron, still clutching her frying pan. In keeping with this first dash, competitors these days have to be local women and they must wear an apron and a hat or scarf.

Yesterday it was revealed that two thirds of people don't know how to make a pancake.

Researchers found that 40 per cent don't know the ingredients - and three in 10 people have never even tried to make a pancake.

Sales of ready-made mixes have soared in recent years because people are too lazy to mix flour, milk and eggs.

Researchers,
for shopping channel QVC, found that 59 per cent of people have dropped
pancakes on the floor - and one in eight people have accidentally hit 
someone.

As Britain celebrates Shrove Tuesday, students will attempt to break the 
world record for the largest gathering of people simultaneously flipping
pancakes for 30 seconds.

The University of Birmingham hoped to get more than 895 students together to break the record set by the University of Sheffield.

Singer Susan Boyle got in on the act by spending the morning cooking with schoolchildren in Edinburgh.

She donned a chef's apron and hat as she took part in a pancake-making day with young children at St Augustine's High School. She said she will be giving up chocolate for Lent.

In Ely choristers took part in their traditional pancake race at the cathedral. The boys, aged between eight and 13, wore their red cassocks for the annual event.

They raced around the 12th Century cathedral, which has one of the longest naves in Britain.

'Choristers have taken part in a pancake race at the cathedral for as long as anyone can remember,' said Lesley Ann Thompson, a spokeswoman for Ely Cathedral.

'It marks the start of Lent which is a period of austerity and it’s something fun for them to do. The boys always really enjoy it.'

Chefs created the world’s first black pudding pancake for Shrove Tuesday in Bury, Lancashire.

The pancake is filled with chorizo and
finely chopped red onion as well as black pudding, and is topped with a
wholegrain mustard and double cream sauce. It’s served with a simple 
mixed baby leaf salad.

Victoria Kay, manager of the Barista cafi bar where the Shrove Tuesday delicacy has been created, said: 'We have spent the whole of February 
testing various combinations for the black pudding pancake, and our 
final recipe is not only tasty, but also tosses brilliantly.'

Makes: 12

1) Sift the flour with a pinch of 
salt into a medium-sized bowl and make a well in the middle. Mix the 
milk and 100ml water together. Break the eggs into the well and start 
whisking slowly. Add the milk and water in a steady stream, whisking 
constantly and gradually incorporating the flour as you do so.

2 Whisk until the batter is smooth and
all the flour has been incorporated.  Set the batter aside to  rest for
30 minutes, then whisk the melted butter into the batter.

3 Heat a pan over a medium heat and 
add a little melted butter. Using a ladle, pour roughly 2 tbsp of batter
into the pan and swirl it around so the bottom of the pan is evenly 
coated. You want to  use just enough batter  to make a delicate,  lacy 
pancake.

5 Cook the pancake for about 45 
seconds on one side until golden. Then, using a palette knife or  fish 
slice, flip the pancake over and cook the other side for about 30 
seconds until it freckles.

6  Slide the pancake out of the pan 
and either serve immediately or stack on a plate with baking parchment 
in between. Continue until all the batter is used up.

Just 
add orange or lemon zest, a pinch of cinnamon, or even finely chopped herbs and a topping of your choice.

An Australian chef has broken the world record for the largest ever stack of pancakes which was 2.5foot tall.

Andy Wrobel, from Melbourne, put together a pile of 60 pancakes which measured a whopping 76cm.

He beat the previous world record in central Melbourne yesterday after failing in an attempt last year. Andy built a tower 61cm tall almost 12 months ago before it fell over (see the video below).

The chef cooks more than 100,000 pancakes each year - and has made more than three million during a 25 year career.

Mr Wrobel told ABC News in Australia that he did more than 50 hours of practice before he made his successful record-breaking attempt.

'We tried last year and we got to 61 centimetres and did pretty well. We thought we'd give it another go and this year we actually did it,' he said.

'We had a lot of practices, spent about 50 hours, probably used another quarter of a tonne of buckwheat mix, and we finally got to the point where we needed to go.'
