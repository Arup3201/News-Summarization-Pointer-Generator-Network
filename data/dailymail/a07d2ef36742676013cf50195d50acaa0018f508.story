Hollyoaks star Jennifer Metcalfe has been left devastated after being dumped by her Dancing On Ice star boyfriend Sylvain Longchambon.

But the Hollyoaks star has emerged with a smile on her face as she headed to work on Tyneside on Monday.

Jennifer opted for comfort in a onesie, a woolly hat and glasses as she arrived for the matinee performance of show Cinderella as she arrived at the Whitley Bay Playhouse where she is starring in the title role.

I'm a survivor: Jennifer is said to be devastated after ice-skater Sylvain Longchambon dumped her after telling her he was 'developing feelings' for new Dancing On Ice partner Samia Ghadie

The actress' ice-dancer boyfriend 
ended their relationship on Friday during a phone call, and reports 
claim he has 'developed feelings' for his new Dancing On Ice partner, 
Coronation Street actress Samia Ghadie.

Jennifer, 29, also met her ex when she was partnered with him on the show two years ago, and she is said to be 'in bits'.

While talk of a relationship has been denied, a source close to the actress' former skater boyfriend say he has 'developed feelings' for new partner Samia, 30, and that Sylvain had been open with Jennifer about this.

The
Hollyoaks beauty was said to have thought it just a phase, so was 
devastated when he called her on Friday night from France - where he had
flown to for Christmas - to tell her that their two-year relationship 
was over.

But pals told The Daily Star
that Jennifer was far from prepared for a phone call calling time on 
their romance and they added the slim star, who plays mouthy Mercedes in
the Channel 4 teen soap, won't stay sad for long and warned her ex that 
her upset will soon turn to anger.

One said: 'Jennifer is absolutely gutted. She just did not see this coming. She is in bits.

'She feels like she has been kicked in the teeth and is devastated. But it won't be long before her upset turns to anger.'

But Samia, who split from ex Corrie co-star Will Thorp in Decmeber, has denied there is anything romantic going on between her and Sylvain.

A source close to Samia told the MailOnline: 'She isn't dating Sylvain 
and they haven't seen each other for three weeks. There has been no 
date, there is nothing going on between them.'

Working relationship: The pair hung out with their Dancing On Ice colleagues at a London hotel earlier this month

The source told the Sunday Mirror: 'When Sylvain first admitted that he had real feelings for Samia, she was gutted.

'It's been a difficult time but she thought it would pass. She has 
been putting on a brave face for the audiences... he is a consummate 
professional.'

It is sure to be a difficult concept for Jennifer, who is currently 
starring in pantomime, to accept as she and Sylvain met and fell in love
while working on the 2010 series.

At
the time, their on-screen chemistry was impossible to ignore, with 
Jennifer apparently inquiring as to his relationship status as soon as 
they first met.

Since
the end of the show, the couple have remained together, even moving in 
together and happily posing at red carpet events until recently.

It
is as yet unclear if Samia, best known as Maria Connor in Coronation 
Street, shares the same chemistry with the handsome Frenchman.

She
has been skating with the Olympic skater since October, and in an 
interview with the Sunday Mirror's Celebs magazine, due to be published 
next week, she gushes about him - but refuses to discuss Will.

She tells the magazine: 'I've only 
got good things to say. Sylvain is brilliant. He is so kind, patient and
thoughtful. I can see how you'd end up in a relationship with your 
partner. You get to know each other intensely and there is a lot of 
trust.

'They ask you what 
you want in a partner and I said, someone nice, someone strong, someone 
patient and someone with a good sense of humour, and he's got all that.'

When
asked if she gets annoyed with him for leaving her with aching ribs 
after training she says: 'No I couldn't, he's so lovely.'

Samia had been throwing herself into skating practice after quietly splitting from Will in early December.

Similarly, the Daily Star Sunday reports that friends of Samia claim she is seeing the French skater.

They add that Sylvain and Jennifer 
split after a 'rocky couple of weeks', at around the same time that 
Samia and Will's union drew to an end.

The
couple started dating in January 2011 - just a few weeks after Samia 
left her husband Matthew Smith after six years of marriage.

In December 2010, Will - who played builder Chris Gray in the soap - had left his wife Samantha, mother of his two children. However, both Samia and Will insisted they didn't start dating until their marriages were over.

At the time Samia and Will's romance was made public, Matthew - father of her daughter Freya - said: 'They have to live with what they have done... She's my wife. I love her.'

Metcalfe's spokesperson declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline.
