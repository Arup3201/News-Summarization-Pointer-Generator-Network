'Breaking Bad' creator Vince Gilligan has chewed out fans who've thrown pizzas onto a New Mexico home so they can reenact a scene from the popular AMC series.

The Albuquerque residence in question was used as the exterior for protagonist Walter White's house. 

Gilligan made the remarks in a podcast about the show's spin-off prequel 'Better Call Saul' which was uploaded to YouTube on Tuesday.

The homeowners have dealt with fans showing up and throwing pizzas onto the roof, Gilligan said.

Bad behavior: 'Breaking Bad' creator Vince Gilligan has chewed out fans who've thrown pizzas onto a New Mexico home so they can reenact a scene from the show. Walter White, seen here played by Bryan Cranston, threw a pizza onto his house in the third season after a confrontation with his wife

Homeowner: Frances Padilla, who lives inside the Albuquerque home that was used for exteriors, told KRQE 'If you’re going to be a jerk, stay the hell away'

Gilligan said in the podcast 'The house in Albuquerque - the Walter White residence - the house that we used for "Breaking Bad" is a bit of a tourist attraction, as most of us know at this point. And the lady who lives in that house - she and her husband are the two nicest people in the world, and they deserve to be treated well.

'And what's going on is - and this has been okay with her for a long time, that people come by and visit and get their picture taken in front of the house - just so long as they do so within reason and they do it in a respectful manner.

'But lately, we're hearing from her that folks are wandering onto her property and they are being rude to her when she comes out and basically says "You're on my property," and they're throwing pizzas on roofs and stuff like that.

'Let me tell ya, there is nothing original or funny or cool about throwing a pizza on this lady's roof. She is [...] it is just not funny. It's been done before. You're not the first.'

Actor Jonathan Banks, who played Mike Ehrmantraut in 'Breaking Bad' and reprises his role in 'Better Call Saul,' chimed in, saying 'And if I catch you doing it, I will hunt you down.'

'I'm with ya, I'm with ya brother,' Gilligan said. 'Again, I don't think we're talking to the folks who are guilty of that, but if we are, I don't even know what to say to ya. So uncool.'

Gilligan asked for fans to stop the behavior. 

Warning: 'Breaking Bad' actor Dean Norris posed with Louie and Frances Padilla and posted a warning against throwing pizzas on Twitter in 2012. Their home is seen here decorated with the address number that appears on the show

Later in the podcast, Gilligan said of those who have thrown pizzas  'I don't love those fans. I don't even consider 'em fans. I consider 'em jagoffs.'

On 'Breaking Bad,' Walter White, played by Bryan Cranston, throws a pizza onto the roof in a third-season episode after he has a confrontation with his wife Skyler, played by Anna Gunn, and she slams the door in his face.

Actor Dean Norris, who played Hank Schrader on 'Breaking Bad,' in fact warned  fans about pizza-throwing in December 2012.

Norris uploaded a photograph of himself posing with homeowners Frances and Louie Padilla to Twitter.

The caption read 'Real owners of Walts house No they don't cook meth Yes they will kick your ass. If u throw another pizza on their roof.'

Frances Padilla said in a recent interview with KRQE 'Most people are respectful. It's the few idiots that come that think they're entitled to do whatever the hell they want, and it's not going to happen.'

Padilla told the television station 'If people trespass on my property, I’m going to prosecute them. Period. That’s it.' 

She also said of the pizza-throwing visitors 'Some people have tried and missed, some people have gotten them on there, but what they don't understand is this is a private residence, and it's really frustrating.'

Visitor: This August 27, 2014 tweet claimed the 'Lady who lives in breaking bad house thought we were gonna throw pizza on her roofThreatened to call 911.' Frances Padilla, who lives at the home, has recently said she would prosecute trespassers
