Liverpool left-back Alberto Moreno insists he and his team-mates must get their season back on track to repay the 'amazing' support Reds fans have shown them this season.

Moreno, a £12million acquisition from Sevilla in the summer, made a bright start to life in the Barclays Premier League when he scored a spectacular solo goal during Liverpool's 3-0 victory at Tottenham.

However, he has since been unable to add to his tally as Liverpool have struggled to replicate the form that saw them finish runners-up to Manchester City last season, with the Merseysiders 11th in the league standings ahead of Sunday's trip to Crystal Palace.

Moreno has paid tribute to Liverpool fans and admits their loyal support gives him extra motivation to improve the club's fortunes on the pitch.

'For me, these supporters are one of the few sets of fans - in fact the best - at really supporting and getting behind their team that I have seen at a football ground,' the 22-year-old Spain international told his club's website.

'It's amazing and my hairs really stand on end every time I hear them cheering us on. I especially love the fact that in spite of these defeats we've had of late, they never stop or tire of supporting the team and are always there for us.

'I don't think they'll ever let us down. That's why we really have to turn things around, for that set of supporters that we have, always driving us on, we have to do it for them.'

Moreno has quickly settled into life at Liverpool and hopes to remain with the club for many years.

'To be totally honest, I am extremely happy here,' he said. 'I'm overjoyed with how things are going.

'It has really flown by. I think that's important for a player - the months passing by quickly - as it means that things are going well, you are playing regularly and performing quite well. I really hope that I can stay here for a long time to come.'
