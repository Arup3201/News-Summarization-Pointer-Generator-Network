With the media storm that's surrounded Vanessa Stiviano over the past few months, it's no wonder she fancied letting her hair down for a night out on the town.

So just days after charges were dropped against a man who allegedly assaulted her, V.Stiviano stepped out in another unique outfit, ready to let her hair down in her home town of Los Angeles.

The fashionista, who has become renowned for her unusual sense of style, stepped out in a barely-there tight black dress and a gilet with faux-fur fringing - just three days after police appealed for more information about an alleged hate crime against the self-styled philanthropist.

V. Stiviano goes out in Los Angeles sporting a barely-there black dress and a faux-fur fringed gilet

The self-styled model completed the look by painting black paw prints down the side of her face, in another sign of her unique style

The model had earlier posted a photo on Instagram which showed 
her hand with a Lakers championship ring - sparking rumours she might 
have traded sides in the ongoing drama involving Clippers owner Donald Sterling

But instead of sporting her now-trademark visor - an item she has barely been seen without since the row erupted over reviled Clippers owner Donald Sterling - V.Stiviano completed the look with a unique set of paw prints which were painted down the right-side of her face.

Just hours earlier, the 31-year-old had posted a photo of her hand on Instagram, which showed her wearing a Los Angeles Lakers championship ring - something not included in her evening outfit.

In a move which could be seen as a direct slur on her former lover Mr Sterling, she also praised the late owner of Lakers, Dr. Jerry Buss, calling him a philanthropist and an American hero.

Her public appearance came three days after charges were dropped against a man who she claims assaulted her while shouting racial slurs

Clippers - which has an historic rivalry with Lakers - was propelled into the media spotlight after the NBA millionaire owner was allegedly recorded berating V.Stiviano for hanging around with black players.

Since then, the model, who was formerly the mistress of Mr Sterling, has hardly been out of the public eye.

She has garnered herself a loyal following for her unique sense of style but is also criticised for alleged attention-seeking.

The latest set of photos come just days after V. Stiviano's latest scandal, which involved hate-crime charges being brought against Dominick Diorio, who was accused of assaulting her while yelling racial slurs.

Charges were dropped against Mr Diorio earlier this year, although the New York Police Department enlisted the public's help in gathering new information about the alleged assault.

The renewed effort to acquire new leads in the case comes a week after NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton was quoted as saying 'we would have hoped that she would stay on the West Coast,' noting that at that time she was yet to make a police report of the alleged assault, but had already told her story to the media.

Now, however, the NYPD is peppering the the city with flyers asking for witnesses to come forward with information about the alleged assault.

Dominick Diorio, the 40-year-old man accused of attacking V.Stiviano in the alleged racist assault, has denied the charges.

Diorio made a brief court appearance last week and was released without bail.

He went on to accuse Stiviano of inventing the attack in order to gain publicity or to 'keep her name in the spotlight'.

'Simply put, a credible victim of a crime does not have her attorney call the press before she calls the police,' said Diorio's attorney, David Scott Smith.

'Miss Stiviano seems intent on keeping her name in the spotlight. But I can assure you if this case goes to trial, my cross-examination will last longer than her 15 minutes of fame.'

Pictures which V. Stiviano claims are proof she was assaulted in New York City were released last week.

The images allegedly show extensive bruising across the right side of the 31-year-old's face.

In
 one photograph, taken after the alleged assault outside the 
Gansevoort Hotel, a stunned looking Stiviano has what appears to be a 
huge florid mark burgeoning from her eye down to her chin.

In
 the other, which was presumably taken the day after, Stiviano's face 
seems to be painfully swollen, especially around her cheek.

Even though she is wearing make-up in one of the photographs, the effects of the alleged attack appear to be visible.

Diorio, of Old Bethpage, Long Island, appeared in Manhattan Criminal Court for his arraignment.

He was initially changed with assault and a hate crime but these charges were reduced to assault in the hearing.

Smith, told The New York Post that he is pleased the hate crime charges have been dropped.

'I’d like to commend the District Attorney’s Office for deciding not to prosecute my client for a hate crime and to consent to his release without bail,' said Smith.

'I’m confident that as this case goes forward and the investigation continues, that Miss Stiviano’s allegations will likewise begin to fail and at the end of the day, the assault charge will be dismissed as well.'

Diorio, who was reportedly celebrating his 40th birthday before the alleged run-in with Stiviano, appeared to have a small amount of bruising on his face.

He allegedly told investigators he just 'slipped and fell' after a woman threw a phone at him.

However, Stiviano offers an alternative explanation for his injuries.

She claims he and another man allegedly hurled racist abuse at her during a random attack on Sunday evening.

She claims their slurs included the N-word.

Diorio allegedly became involved in an argument with Stiviano inside Revel restaurant, which is near to the Gansevoort hotel in Manhattan's meatpacking district.

She alleges Diorio and his friends followed her and her two female dining companions until they were outside the hotel and then pounced.

'The defendant and another unapprehended individual followed her down the street while repeatedly calling her a ‘[n-word] bitch’ and a ‘whore,’ according to Stiviano's criminal complaint.

'The defendant reached through an open taxi window and struck her in the face with his closed fist.'

According to Stiviano, Diorio and his friend spat at her before screaming racial obscenities at her.

’Yeah, I’ll f*****g hit a girl. I’ll hit you, you n****r b***h,’ the DA quoted Diorio as saying according to The New York Post.

Because Stiviano and her lawyer Mac Nehoray had not filed a police report on Sunday, officers had not been investigating the fight.

But on Monday Stiviano filed a complaint with the NYPD and on the same day Diorio turned himself into police.

He was identified in surveillance footage by police and then put in a lineup and picked out by Stiviano on Tuesday.

Diroio currently lives with his parents and his father told The New York Post of his shock.

'Wow, I'am not going to tell my wife about this. That'll just upset her. I don't know what to do.'

Recorded: Donald Sterling was recorded making racist remarks that resulted in an NBA ban in April and a fight over ownership of the Clippers

After Stiviano recorded the racist rant, it was leaked to the press and led to Sterling's ejection from professional basketball.

He then handed control of team to his wife Shelly before a $2 billion deal to sell the franchise was agreed with former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer.

It came just days before an NBA panel was due to meet to discuss revoking Sterling's ownership over the team in light of the racism scandal last month.

However the deal has yet to go through as it has to be approved by the NBA and Sterling is believed to be fighting it.

Sterling had bought the Clippers for $12.5 million in 1981.
