A disabled grandfather on a mobility scooter ambushed his estranged wife then stabbed her six times when she told him their marriage was over, a court heard.

Multiple Sclerosis sufferer William Berry, 61, armed himself with two knives and travelled almost three miles on the 5mph scooter from his home to the secondary school where his wife was employed as a kitchen assistant.

He waited until Debra Berry, 52, had finished her shift and followed her to a nearby bus stop where the pair discussed a solicitor's letter he had received regarding the family home.

As she turned away from him, the wheelchair-bound former electricity worker stabbed her six times in the back with a 20cm serrated kitchen knife before she fled to a nearby colleague's house  in Bolton, Greater Manchester.

He then turned the knife on himself and plunged the blade twice into his stomach.

Horrified witnesses phoned police as Berry holed himself up in a nearby garden during the afternoon of October 15 last year - only dropping the blade when officers threatened to taser him.

Recalling the event in a statement, Mrs Berry said her husband came at her with 'gritted teeth' and she is now so scared of knives she has to buy pre-chopped fruit and vegetables from the supermarket. 

Today, Berry was sentenced to two years and eight months in prison despite pleas to suspend the sentence due to his needs. 

He was also issued with a restraining order banning him from contacting Mrs Berry for three years. He was further ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £120.

Bolton Crown Court sitting at Manchester Magistrates' Court heard Berry married his wife in 1999 but was diagnosed with the debilitating neurological condition MS just a year later and his health deteriorated rapidly.

He was forced to medically retire from his job with NORWEB and his wife soon became his full-time carer. But the marriage was failing and Mrs Berry eventually left her husband in July last year.

Failing to cope with the breakup, Berry persisted in contacting his wife and would phone their mutual friends and wait outside St James' secondary school in Farnworth, Bolton, where she worked.

On the day of the tragedy he had received a letter which he believed meant she was forcing the sale of their home and taking half of the proceedings.

It was in fact just to protect herself in case of a future sale as she was preparing to make financial arrangements in regards to his care.

However this sparked Berry into deciding he wanted to take his own life in front of his wife - so he left a note for his children, the front door unlocked and set off on his mobility scooter to her place of work.

Prosecuting, Nicola Carroll said: 'He accompanied her to the bus stop within yards of the school. They had a brief discussion about the letter from the solicitor and she states that the defendant had his hands on his lap. 

'She assumed he needed the toilet and hoped that would mean he would leave her alone.

'She turned her back and he was still on the scooter and as she stood in front of him but with her back to him she felt what she described as a thump to the middle of her back which caused her to fall to the ground.

'She fell to the ground, positioned herself on all fours, turned her head to look at him and saw him still on the scooter holding the knife in his hand and she says he had gritted teeth. 

'She then felt another blow to her shoulder and she got up screaming and crying and made her way across the road to the garden of a friend.'

Mrs Berry was airlifted to hospital while police dealt with her husband who was telling police he wanted to end his own life. 

She escaped with just one 2cm wound to her back near her spine and five superficial injuries and she was released from hospital a day later.

Berry, of Bolton, was not fit to be interviewed until almost two months later as he began to recover from his self-inflicted wounds, telling police in hospital that he did not intend to harm her - he just wanted to kill himself.

He was initially charged with attempted murder but pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to the lesser charge of wounding with intent.

A statement read to the court from Mrs Berry said: 'I have nerve damage to the stab wounds. My back is still the same and will never change. I can't bend, stretch, or pick up heavy things.

'I still get upset and cry and think what have I done to deserve this? I am scared to be on my own and have extra security.

'I can no longer use knives and am told that I have suffered Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I now have pre-cut groceries to help me. I can't watch the news or TV as this brings back memories.'

On behalf of Berry, who was living in a nursing home before he was imprisoned, defence lawyer Tim Hopley said: 'The defendant talks of a mist or a lack of full comprehension over what he was doing. 

'The defendant was capable of significantly more serious injuries than what was caused.

'In 2013 many factors came to a head which led to a mental disorder. MS is an invidious disease. It is always looming. 

'That, combined with the breakdown of his marriage and the discovery of significant debts he was unaware of. 

'It has become the view that his wife had reasons other than debts to get out of the marriage. There may have been another party involved.

'Depression is a common side effect of MS and bound to have a detrimental effect on his thinking process. He has little life left in terms of activity. 

'His activities amount to watching TV and socialising with other residents in the home. He wishes to express his genuine and sincere remorse and regret for what he did. 

'The divorce is towards its conclusion and that part of his life is over but he certainly had no desire to cause her the impact which it appears it has.'

But Judge Timothy Clayson said: 'She is still suffering significant ongoing problems. She has psychological damage which manifests itself in a fear of seeing you or members of your family and she can't face using knives.'

He added: 'You found the breakdown of the relationship impossible to deal with and made many efforts to contact her by phone and by attending her place of work.

'She began divorce proceedings and was seeking to organise the financial affairs and as a result, on October 15 you received a letter from the solicitor about financial matters and wrongly interpreted that - thinking she was trying to force the sale of the home but she was trying to register her interest in it.

'When you met her at the school there was no indication of any sort of what was to come. You said your intention was to kill yourself in front of her. It could easily have been so much worse.'
