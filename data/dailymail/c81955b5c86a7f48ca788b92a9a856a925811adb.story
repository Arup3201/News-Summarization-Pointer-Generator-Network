A Canadian judge was left stumped when faced with a tangled family feud stemming from a grisly throat-slashing incident on a Caribbean vacation.

Cathy Clayson, a bank manager from Ajax, has accused her estranged husband, Paul Martin, of attacking her with a hooked gutting knife, strangling her and leaving her for dead along a dirt road in Montego Bay, Jamaica, in December 2010.

Martin, a 47-year-old school teacher, was acquitted in Jamaica three years ago of wound with intent after spending four months in prison.

He said, she sad: Paul Martin (right), 47, was acquitted in Jamaica in 2011 of attempting to kill his wife, Cathy Clayson (left), who is now suing him in civil court in Canada 

The husband has maintained his innocence, claiming that his wife attacked him first and injured her own neck in the melee.

Last year, Clayson, 38, filed a civil lawsuit against her husband seeking a divorce, more than $300,000 in damages, custody of their two children, ages 6 and 9, an end to Martin's visitation rights and a declaration that her husband had tried to kill her on December 23, 2010.

But according to his ruling handed down late last month, Ontario Superior Court Justice Roger Timms could make neither heads nor tails of the couple's puzzling case.

'The parties have both told too many lies. They have both distorted and exaggerated the truth too often,' Timms wrote in his decision from December 30 cited by Toronto Star. 'They have both said too many nonsensical and illogical things.'

The judge did suggest that the evidence supports Martin's version of events, and that nothing points to a premeditated attack.

After sidestepping the issue of the attempted murder, Timms granted Clayson full custody of their two children but ruled that Martin should have equal and unsupervised access .

Justice Timms' ruling came five months after the conclusion of the civil trial in Oshawa, during which Martin chose to represent himself and at one point cross-examined his estranged wife, marking their first encounter since the alleged attack on the last day of their ill-fated tropical getaway.

Cathy Clayson has since retained high-powered attorney Marie Henein, who also represents disgraced former CBC radio host Jian Ghomeshi in his sex abuse case.

Last week, Henein filed an appeal on Clayson's behalf claiming that Justice Timms was biased against the woman.

The notice of appeal alleges that Timms ‘misapprehended material facts’ and ‘minimized and justified the numerous inconsistencies and exaggerations’ in Martin’s evidence.

During the trial in May, Clayson recounted in court how on December 18, 2010, she and Martin decided to travel to an all-inclusive resort in Montego Bay, Jamaica, even though their marriage was on the brink of collapse.

On the final day of their vacation, with only three hours left before their flight home, Clayson said her husband insisted they drive to a remote spot to take pictures on a cliff.

According to Clayson, Martin pulled over their rental car on a secluded dirt road, took out a hooked knife and slashed her twice across the throat, opening a 4-inch gash.

A struggle ensued inside the car, during which the married school teacher allegedly attempted to strangle his wounded spouse.

He then left her for dead on the side of the road and headed to a police station, where he claimed the couple had been robbed by bandits.

He's at a loss: Canadian Justice Roger Timms wrote in December 30 decision the couple told too many lies, making it impossible to determine what happened

Martin later changed his story, accusing Clayson of attacking him first and injuring her own throat in the process.

A Good Samartian discovered Cathy Clayson and took her to the hospital.

In his decision partially siding with Martin, Judge Timms wrote that a forensic expert found no blood in any section of the backseat of the rental car, even though Clayson was bleeding from her neck, and that it was 'impossible' for her to get a cut on the inside of her thumb while shielding her neck from the blade with her hand.
