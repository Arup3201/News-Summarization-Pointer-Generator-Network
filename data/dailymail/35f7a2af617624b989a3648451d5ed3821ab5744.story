Their bodies had lay in shallow graves in the dense Malaysian jungle for almost 60 years.

However, the crew and passengers of a Royal Air Force plane which crashed during ferocious conflict in 1950 have finally been laid to rest, four years after their bodies were excavated in 2008.

All 12 victims - including eight British servicemen - were given a full burial today following a painstaking search inspired by the brother of one of the dead airmen.

Crash site: The wreckage of RAF Dakota KN630 which crashed deep in the Malaysian jungle on August, 1950, during a target marking mission near Kempong Jendera, killing all 12 crew and passengers on board

Remains: The bodies were discovered in 2008, excavated from shallow graves close to the plane's wreckage

Paying their respects: Members of the 150-strong expedition team laying a poppy wreath at the crash site

Military honour: Members of the Queen's Colour Squadron and the 47th Squadron of the British Royal Air Force carry a casket of a British soldier for the reburial ceremony at the Commonwealth War Grave Cemetery

The RAF Dakota aircraft suffered catastrophic engine failure and went down during a mission in 1950.

UK forces were dispatched to the country to fight against Communist insurgents in a conflict known as the Malayan Emergency between 1948 and 1960.

The plane from 52 Squadron had been dropping smoke markers near Kempong Jendera to help Lincoln bombers pinpoint Communist camps, but it lost power during its second run and plummeted into a ravine.

RAF pilot Edward Talbot, 27, from Dorchester, Dorset; navigator Geoffrey Carpenter, 23, from West Norwood, Greater London and signaller Thomas O'Toole, 34, from Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, were the crew.

They left their base at RAF Changi, Singapore, on the morning of August 25, 1950, with four Royal Army Service Corps Despatchers - Corporal Phillip Bryant, 25, from Southend-on-Sea, Essex; Driver Peter Taylor, 20, from Bournemouth, Dorset; Driver Roy Wilson, 21, from Birkenhead, Merseyside and Driver Oliver Goldsmith, 21, from Neston, Cheshire.

Described as a guerilla war, the 
Malayan Emergency was a conflict fought between the UK, Commonwealth and
 other security forces against Communist insurgents in 
Malaysia.

It lasted from 1948 to 1960 and began after a period of sustained civil unrest in the region.

The Malayan economy was left in turmoil following the withdrawal of Japan at the end of the Second World War.

Attempts were made by the British 
administration to repair the country's economy, as revenue from Malaya's
 tin and rubber industries were important to Britain's own post-war 
recovery.

However, food was scarce and 
expensive, wages were low and unemployment was high. Significant labour 
unrest resulted in a large number of strikes between 1946 and 1948.

Protestors were dealt with harshly 
during the strikes, with many being arrested and deported. This resulted
 in protesters becoming more and more militant.

The Malayan Emergency was sparked on 
June 16, 1948, by the first overt act of war; three European plantation 
managers were killed at Sungai Siput, Perak, and retaliation against Communist insurgents was swift.

Passengers Major John Procter, a 
British Army Officer; Anker Rentse, a civilian lands development 
officer; Pc Mohammed Bin Abdul Lalil; Sakiak guide Saiap Alais Sherda 
and civilian Yaacob Mat were picked up later at Kota Bahu airfield.

A rescue party reached the crash site in early September 1950 after nine days journey on foot to discover all 12 had died.

The bodies were buried near the crash 
site in a shallow grave because the difficult terrain and prevailing 
security situation placed the rescue party at severe risk of attack.

However, decades later, the brother of Flight Navigator Geoffrey Carpenter - 82-year-old Dennis - wrote to the Malaysian tourist office in
 Britain asking for a map of the remote mountainous region around 
Kampung Penchong where they died.

In
 a remarkable stroke of luck, his request landed on the desk of a 
military officer at the Malaysian High Commission in London.

Colonel
 Tajri Alwi ordered a full-scale expedition to be carried out to recover
 the remains of the warplane, and incredibly, the Malaysian Army’s 8th 
Brigade located the wreckage.

In November 2008 a 150-strong team of Malaysian military, police and specialist forensic archaeologists recovered the men's remains.

Father of three Mr Carpenter, who is married to 
Jean, 82, said: ‘He left home so young I never knew him fully but we were always 
determined to see him properly buried.

‘We could have gone out before now but we had 
nowhere to visit. It is comforting that we now have a proper grave with a 
headstone.’

Excavation: Members of the 150 strong expedition team search for remains at the crash site. The dead were found in 2008

Laid to rest: Relatives of the British soldiers killed during the Malayan Emergency in 1950 lay wreaths during the reburial ceremony at the Commonwealth War Grave Cemetery in Kuala Lumpur

Final journey: Family members of the crew and passengers of those killed laid their loved ones to rest with military honours
