This is the moment a Gary Barlow tribute act got down on one knee to propose in the middle of a performance.

Dan Maines, 32, was half way through singing Take That hit 'A Million Love Songs' when he stepped off the stage and pulled out a ring for girlfriend Vicki Gaiger at a New Year's Eve gig in Wales.

The 25-year-old waitress said yes before she burst into tears and fell into his arms as the crowd of fans clapped and cheered. 

Dan Maines, 32, a Gary Barlow tribute act, was midway through singing when he got down on one knee

He was performing at a New Year's Eve gig in Wales when he asked girlfriend Vicki Gaiger, 25, to marry him

Miss Gaiger, from Herne Bay in Kent, said: 'We'd had a little set-to on the way to Wales  as Dan got us lost, so I thought he was just trying to apologise.

'I had no idea what was happening when he proposed.'I was already pretty overwhelmed by the dedication with the song, so it was definitely a shock.' 

The couple originally met at one of his gigs where he was performing with Take That tribute act, Rule the World, in March last year where they performed in Miss Gaiger's home town.

She added: 'I found out he lived 328 miles away in Cleckheaton in West Yorkshire.

The couple had met at one of his gigs a year ago, where he performed with band mates from Rule The World

The moment was captured on tape as Miss Gaiger looked shocked before saying 'yes' and bursting into tears

The couple are now hopeful that the real Gary Barlow might perform at their wedding after he announced he would perform at three receptions this year

'It wasn't ideal, but it didn't stop us. We chatted and Facetimed each other for a few weeks, then Dan came down for a "date weekend" and hasn't left since. 

Mr Maines said: 'I knew the moment I met Vicki that I would marry her, it was just a case of picking the right time.

'We wanted to be living together for a year before we got engaged but I felt it would have been less of a surprise if I waited the full 12 months.

'I felt there was nothing more perfect than having the chance to see in the New Year with the woman I love as my fiance.'

Mr Maines has been performing on stage for a decade and, along with his bandmates, he recently met Take That on the Graham Norton Show.

He added: 'I've been gigging for 10 years and performed in some of the most prestigious venues in the world.

'But I have to say that I have never come close to feeling as nervous as I did on New Year's Eve.

'I'm a very lucky man and very proud and privileged to call Vicki my fiance.'

The couple flew to the Canary Islands this week to celebrate their engagement and now hope the real Gary Barlow will take to the stage at their wedding.

A hopeful Miss Gaiger said: 'Everyone's tweeting him to get him to sing at our wedding.

'He has said he will sing this year at three weddings, but we want to wait until next summer, so who knows.'
