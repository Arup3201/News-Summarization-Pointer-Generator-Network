As part of the build-up to the start of MailOnline's Fantasy Football season, we will be taking a look at players new to the Premier League with the potential to light up England's top tier over the coming campaign.

GRAZIANO PELLE IN A NUTSHELL

Southampton fans have every right to mourn the exodus of talent from St Mary's this summer, but in recent signing Graziano Pelle, they also have a reason to hope. 

The muscular 6ft 4in forward has the physical attributes to torment Premier League defences, and a clinical edge to his game that could make him a huge hit on the south coast.

Physical presence: Pelle has shown himself to be a handful for defenders in Southampton's pre-season games

New arrival: Southampton completed the £8m signing of Pelle from Dutch side Feyenoord earlier this summer

Last season Pelle scored 23 times in 28 games in the Eredivisie for Feyenoord as they finished runner-up behind Ajax.

He also prodived six assists for his team-mates over the course of the league campaign and won on average 5.4 aerial duels a game, while having 4.3 shots per match. 

His pass success rate - at 69.7% - was quite high for a striker that is often trying to bring others into play.

WHY YOU SHOULD HAVE PELLE IN YOUR MAILONLINE FANTASY FOOTBALL TEAM

Saints boss Ronald Koeman made the Italian his first purchase after taking the reins at the club, with the Dutch coach confident his former Feyenoord charge has what it takes to fill the void upfront created by Rickie Lambert's move to Southampton.

The 29-year-old's phenomenal goalscoring record in recent years at Feyenoord shows he poses a far greater threat than your average target man.

There is also huge potential for him to thrive leading the line for Koeman's Southampton side, with Jay Rodriguez - should he stay at the club - set to play just off the imposing frontman.

His Fantasy Football price, £8.2m, is another reason why it is worth taking a punt on Pelle. He will be first-choice at St Mary's, particularly with Koeman in charge, and his transfer fee is far lower than some other strikers in the Premier League who are likely to see far less playing time.

Rickie Lambert. £9.7m. Cough.

THE GAME HE PROVED HIS WORTH IN 

It's early doors for Pelle at Southampton but the striker has impressed in his pre-season outings for the Saints. 

On his debut he scored twice in his first 45 minutes on the pitch against KSK Hasselt, and he also put in an impressive performance during Koeman's side's 1-0 win over Swindon, Pelle's first match on English soil for the club. 

His hold-up play was superb in both, and he also showed his ability in front of goal with a couple of neat finishes in the first game and some shots on target in the latter.

Making an early impact: The Italian scored twice in Southampton's 6-0 win against KSK Hasselt

DON'T JUST TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT

Koeman believes he has got a rare commodity in Pelle after making the Italian his first signing at St Mary's.

He said 'I had Graziano in my team for my last two years at Feyenoord. He scored a lot of goals - more than 50 in two seasons - and they brought a lot of points to the club.

'Goals mean points, and we needed a good player in that position after Rickie Lambert left.

'In terms of his qualities, he's a tall striker with a lot of movement and he's fast. He's a player who gives confidence to the team because he keeps the ball, and he's very dangerous in front of goal.'

HE'S A BETTER, CHEAPER VERSION OF... LOADS OF PREMIER LEAGUE STRIKERS

At £8.2m Pelle is the 33rd most expensive striker in MailOnline's Fantasy Football game, despite his phenomenal scoring record in Holland. 

Just a few of the players that the 29-year-old is cheaper and arguably better than...

Fernando Torres - £9.9m

Rickie Lambert - £9.7m

Andy Carroll - £9.2m

Peter Odemwingie - £8.9m

Shane Long - £8.5m 

Jonathan Walters - £8.3m
