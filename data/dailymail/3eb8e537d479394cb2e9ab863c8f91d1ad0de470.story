Starring Chris Hemsworth, the Marvel superhero sequel earned $109.4million when it opened internationally last weekend and brought in $180.1million globally. Overall, it has grossed $327million worldwide.

In limited theaters Thursday evening, 'Thor: The Dark World' brought in $7.1million overnight.

Surpassing the ticket sales of 'Thor,' which scored $65.7million when it opened in May of 2011, Thor: The Dark World marks a record for a Disney November opening, topping the $70.5million 'The Incredibles' earned in 2004.

Paramount hidden-camera comedy 'Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa' held the second-place slot at the box office for the second weekend in a row, earning $11.3million during its third weekend, with a domestic total reaching more than $78million.

Relativity Media's 3-D animated kiddie flick 'Free Birds,' soared into third place with $11.1million in its second weekend.

CBS Films' 'Last Vegas,' featuring an all-star cast including Michael Douglas, Robert De Niro, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Kline, took fourth place in its second weekend.

Last weekend's box office champ, the sci-fi 'Ender's Game,' starring Harrison Ford, Asa Butterfield and Viola Davis, dropped to fifth place in its second weekend.

Expanding to 1,144 theaters in its fourth week, possible Oscar contender '12 Years a Slave' brought in an impressive $6.6 million over the weekend at No. 7.
