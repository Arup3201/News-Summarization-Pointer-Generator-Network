Her first front row appearance was at Chanel couture, Marc Jacobs cast her in his most recent ad campaign and she’s starring in a film alongside Angelina Jolie: Welcome to the extraordinary world of Elle Fanning.

Now the 16-year-old star has been invited to star on the cover of ASOS magazine and pose for a series of glossy photos showcasing its new summer range.

Shot by Michael Hauptman in Fanning's Los Angeles hometown, the shoot sees the starlet posing prettily in a series of sweet candy coloured crop tops and frothy pastel skirts.

But while all eyes might have been on her chic summer wardrobe, the fashion site's writers were more interested in her style tips.

'I’m very girlie,' she told the magazine, 'so it used to be a lot 
of Peter Pan collars and pouffy dresses, [but] now I’m getting older, I feel 
like I can wear things [that are] a bit more structured and a bit more tomboyish.

She added: 'I’m 
OK with wearing trousers now, but when I was 12, I was like: "No, that’s 
for boys!"'

Elle, who is the sister of fellow Hollywood actress, Dakota, is currently starring as Princess Aurora alongside Angelina Jolie in Maleficent, a dark re-imagining of the 1959 Disney classic.

But despite the poised on-screen performance, Fanning has confessed to feeling nervous about meeting co-star Jolie for the first time.

Speaking to Teen Vogue, the starlet said:  'I remember I came to the studios and they were like, 
"Oh you're going to meet her today" and I'm like: "I am not prepared!"

'So
[then] I turn[ed] the corner and then I saw her, like Angelina Jolie in the 
flesh and she gave me a huge hug.

'She like 
shook my shoulders and said: "We're going to have the best time working 
together!"'

And Angelina isn't the only A-lister who has managed to turn Fanning's nerves to jelly.

'I met Beyoncé the first time I went [to the Met Ball],' she told ASOS magazine. 'I 
was 13 and I was with my sister, who knew that I love Beyoncé so much 
and wanted to meet her.

'Dakota was talking to her and she introduced me,
 but I couldn’t really say anything. Beyoncé turned round and was 
glowing. She said: "You look so cute!" She was really cool.'

Elle is also a friend of Chanel boss Karl Lagerfeld, whom she describes as 'so cool.' She said: 'I’ve known him for a while…ever since he did a shoot with my sister when she was 12.

'He’s just so cool, such an interesting guy, with his fingerless gloves and his Diet Coke. The Chanel couture show was the first one I ever went to, so that was special to me. I remember sitting there with my mouth completely dropping.'

Now art appears to be imitating life for Fanning, currently jetting around the world to promote Maleficent, after she and her sister Dakota were revealed to have royal blood.

According to an ancestry website, the pair of movie star sisters are in fact
 'long lost princesses' who are related to King Edward III and even the Duchess of Cambridge.

Breakthrough: Elle's first role came aged two, playing the younger version of her sister Dakota's characters

After combing through seven centuries' worth of royal geneologies, researchers at Ancestry.com, discovered that the siblings are a distant part of the Royal Family and are descended from King Edward III, who ruled England in the 14th 
century, through their mother, retired professional tennis player 
Heather Joy (née Arrington).

If 16-year-old
 Elle and 20-year-old Dakota really are descended from the monarch then 
they are indeed distantly related to the Queen - ranking as 22nd 
great-grandchildren of King Edward III.

ASOS Magazine, July 2014 will be available online and in print on 28th of May.
