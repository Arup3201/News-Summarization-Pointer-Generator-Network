Germany has swooped on three elderly former guards who served at the Nazi death camp Auschwitz in WW2 where 1.1 million Jews were exterminated.

The arrests follow months of investigations by the country's central war crimes investigation unit which has zeroed in on some two dozen still surviving guards - several of them women.

Those seized this week are all men aged 88, 92 and 94 and living in the southwestern state of Baden-Wurttemberg. 

The German office investigating Nazi war crimes last year identified 30 former Auschwitz (pictured) personnel with a recommendation to bring charges against them

'They are suspected of having participated in murders at the Nazis' Auschwitz extermination camp in occupied Poland,' said prosecutors in a statement.

The 94-year-old is understood to be Hans Koenig, who lives near Stuttgart.

Koenig, an ethnic German from Bratislava, became known as a 'bruiser' in Auschwitz due to his alleged love of cruelty for its own sake. 

He is proud of his past. He told the Bild newspaper in Germany last year: 'At the time the German ethnic group I belonged to had to be tested and I was happy to be a part of that.'

The three elderly men underwent medical tests and then faced a judge who confirmed their fitness to be detained in a prison hospital.

There were three other raides in the states of Hesse and North Rhine-Westphalia - again of suspected war criminals - but no further arrests.  

'Various records and documents from the Nazi era were seized, and their evaluation is ongoing,' said the statement about the Baden-Wurttemberg home raids.

The German office investigating Nazi war crimes last year sent files on 30 former Auschwitz personnel to state prosecutors with a recommendation to bring charges against them.

The renewed drive to bring to justice the last surviving perpetrators of the Holocaust follows a 2011 landmark court ruling which established that all former camp guards can be tried irrespective of whether any eyewitnesses were left alive to testify.

Three women among the suspects are expected to be charged later this year, according to prosecution sources.

Ever since Sobibor death camp guard John Demjanjuk was found guilty for his part in the mass murder of 28,000 Jews in 2011, the gloves have come off for German prosecutors.

Before Demjanjuk it was vital to have every small detail of what they did backed up with witness statements.  After Demjanjuk it is enough to merely prove that suspects were there and helping the machinery of death to function.

Gertrud Elli Schmid, now 92, is one of the female suspects still awaiting arrest.  In wartime she was sent to the camp of Majdanek on the outskirts of Lublin. 

The camp, with its gas chamber and vast crematorium for disposing of the corpses of inmates, is still standing in memorial to the 230,000 people murdered there.

Perhaps the most notorious of all the Nazi concentration camps, 1.1million Jews were killed at Auschwitz.

The camp consisted of three main parts: Auschwitz I (the base camp) Auschwitz II - Birkenau (the extermination camp) and Auschwitz III - Monowitz (the labour camp).

During the war the camp was staffed by 6,500 to 7,000 members of the infamous SS - 15 per cent of whom were later convicted of war crimes.

It was run by camp commandant Rudolf Höss who was tried and hanged in 1947 for his part in the extermination.

The camp was liberated by the Red Army on January 27 1945, the day was subsequently declared International Holocaust Remembrance Day.

Following its liberation the camp has become a symbol of the holocaust and has operated as a museum since 1947

Germany's Nazi-hunting agency, based in the southern city of Ludwigsburg, was tipped off by the sleuths of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre in Israel about her past when an informant turned up her old S.S. ID card in the archive of the former Stasi secret police of East Germany in Berlin.

The card, bearing the number 312, has been authenticated.  It carries the inscription: 'The holder is authorised to bear arms' - meaning she was a pay-grade above ordinary guards usually only permitted to carry a 'schlagstock' - a 'beating stick.'

After service in Majdanek she was sent to Auschwitz where she was based at Birkenau - the complex where the gas chambers were situated.

Before the camp fell to the Russians in January 1945 she was shipped back to Germany and escaped justice at the end of the war. 

But officials at the Ludwigsburg 
authority have, it is understood, testimony from several prisoners now 
dead that she was a 'cruel' and 'merciless' guard who beat prisoners 
with rawhide whips and who was present at the infamous railway ramp 
where daily 'selections' were made about who should live and who was to 
be gassed immediately.

Now
 wheelchair bound her daughter doesn't deny her past but is hoping her 
lack of memory about the time will keep her from prosecution.

'We
 know that my mother had something to do with Auschwitz.  We have tried 
to talk with her about it but her memory doesn't really function any 
more,' she said.

Female
 suspect number two is Gisela Schneider, 90, who now lives in an OAP 
home in northern Germany, was also in Hitler's girl's organisation and 
joined the S.S. in 1940.

The Federal Archive in Berlin threw up her S.S. identity card.  It shows a cold, hard-faced woman who worked in the feared S.S. under her maiden name of Demming.

At Asuchwitz she was a harsh disciplinarian who beat prisoners and who was often in charge of the standing cells - small, dark rooms where up to 15 people at a time were crammed in for minor rule infractions. 

It was not uncommon to leave people in these rooms for days on end, causing the death of some or all of those confined.

She formed a romantic relationship with S.S. Dr.Franz Bernhard Lucas but dropped him when he railed against the hideous experiments on prisoners carried out by notorious 'Angel of Death' Dr Josef Mengele on inmates. 

She was a true believe in the Nazi racial policies that decreed Jews, gypsies and Slavs were 'lesser races' who deserved nothing else.

Female number three is identified only as  Charlotte S. who served under her maiden name beginning with A at the Ravensbrueck concentration camp for women near Berlin.

A fanatical Nazi, she was a dog handler who walked around the camp with an Alsatian that was trained to bite at the privates of inmates.

In 1942 she was transferred to Auschwitz where she and her dog were rightly feared by the prisoners kept as slaves for the numerous war industry factories which dotted the countryside around the camp.

One female prisoner after the war testified: 'There was a woman there with a kindly smile that masked a hideous nature.  She was ramrod straight and had a snarling dog that was indoctrinated to hate the prisoners.

'We would be forced to stand stock still for hours and if anyone moved in the cold or the heat, the dog was unleashed.  Many people did not survive the maulings.'

She began an affair with an S.S. man while serving at the camp and was discharged from the service in 1943 when she fell pregnant.

After the war she was sentenced to 15 months in jail for 'mistreatment of and thefts from prisoners in her charge.'

Now 94, she refuses to speak about her terrible past.   .
