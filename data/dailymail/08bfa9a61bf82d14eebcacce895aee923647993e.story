A baby has cheated death after she was randomly chosen to have a new blood test.

Five-month-old Habul Khatoon was one of 430,000 babies chosen by doctors at Sheffield Children’s Hospital to be screened for five serious conditions.

The test showed that Habul has the rare metabolic condition, Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD), which causes a potentially fatal build up of amino acids in the blood.

As soon as the results came in the seriously ill baby was rushed to hospital, where they discovered she was just hours from death.

Her mother, Fahmeeda Khatoon, said: ‘It was a big shock to begin with. The nurses called me on the phone and then a few minutes later they were at the door.

‘They called an ambulance straight away to take Habul into hospital. At this point she wasn't crying, she was lethargic and already in a coma-like state.’

Mrs Khatoon, who lives in Birmingham, had a normal pregnancy and only realised there was something wrong when her daughter did not settle like normal babies.

MSUD is so rare, and symptoms are initially so broad, that any number of ailments could have been causing the symptoms.

‘She was trying to cry but she wasn't able to. We didn't know what to do,’ said Mrs Khatoon.

However, the child was saved because she took part in the newborn screening just six days after she was born.

Two days later, when Habul was eight-days-old, the results came back showing that she had MSUD, a genetic disorder which stops the body breaking down parts of proteins called amino acids.

The test identified high levels of the amino acid leucine in Habul’s blood, a condition which can lead to coma, brain damage and death if not treated.

Sheer luck: Habul was only diagnosed because she was selected for a screening programme at Sheffield Children's Hospital. (Pictured here with consultant Dr Anupam Chakrapani, left, and head of dietetic services Anita MacDonald, right.)

Mrs Khatoon, 30, said: 'She was a very lucky girl. She had to be taken straight to the Intensive Care Unit.’

Habul was put on dialysis to cleanse her blood and then began special feeds given via a feeding pump.

After just 48 hours she came out of the coma-like state and could cry normally.

She is now being fed low-leucine feeds made up by her mother who has received special training on how to feed her daughter correctly.

MSUD is an inherited metabolic disorder which is caused by a mutation in at least four genes.

It causes a potentially fatal build up of amino acids in the blood.

If untreated it causes brain damage, physical disabilities and death.

Globally it affects about 1 in every 185,000 live births.

Symptoms include maple syrup smelling urine and earwax, poor feeding, vomiting, poor weight gain, lethargy and seizures.

It is managed through a carefully controlled diet which is low in the amino acid leucine.

The only other treatment is liver transplant.

As she grows up Habul will need to have a very low protein diet avoiding eggs, fish and meats amongst other foodstuffs in order to stay well.

Dr Anupam Chakrapani, a consultant at Birmingham Children's Hospital, said: ‘The expanded newborn screening project sped up the diagnosis and treatment of this rare condition and enabled Habul to recover quickly and she has remained very well.’

Mrs Khatoon added: ‘I'm very thankful. Back home in Pakistan there might be many children that pass away on a daily basis so I'm very appreciative of the programme.’

Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust ran the UK pilot to screen babies across the country for five very rare diseases - MSUD, homocystinuria, glutaric aciduria type 1, isovaleric acidaemia and long chain hydroxy acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency.

These tests were carried out on top of the current five, which include tests for cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disorders - for which every newborn is screened.

So far 228,000 babies have been screened and seven children have been diagnosed with rare conditions that would have limited their lives if left untreated.

The results from the pilot will be evaluated by the NHS National Screening Committee early next year before a decision is made on whether to introduce such screening nationwide.

Professor Jim Bonham, director for newborn screening at the  Sheffield Trust, said: ‘So far the project is progressing extremely well. Seven children already have been discovered and this is very encouraging.

‘We're very much looking forward to seeing the end result of this project and hope it will have changed a significant number of children's lives for the better.’
