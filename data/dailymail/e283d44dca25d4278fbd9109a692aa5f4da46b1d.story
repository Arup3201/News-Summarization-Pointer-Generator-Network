The attendance of Kennedy added a touch of glamor for the Japanese, who were impressed the representative of their most important ally decided to commemorate the pivotal moment in the war in the Pacific.

In November, thousands of people lined the streets of Tokyo to greet the daughter of President John F. Kennedy according to Bloomberg when she was transported in a horse-drawn carriage to meet Emperor Arihito.

However, it has not been plain sailing.

In December she was criticized by an aide to Prime Minister Abe after she announced her dissatisfaction he visited Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine which honors war criminals as well as war dead.Â

In June, she went to a ceremony to mark the 240,000 people who perished in the Battle of Okinawa and in a previous interview, Kennedy has said that her visits to Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1978 were among the 'most memorable days of my life.'

She mentioned President Barack Obama's 2009 Nobel Peace Prize for trying to abolish nuclear weapons in an interview with the Mainichi newspaper in Japan.

'President Obama has long worked to rid the world of nuclear weapons and has achieved significant progress during his time in office,' Kennedy said to Mainichi.

'He has said that he would like to visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and I hope that he gets that opportunity.'

Late last month, the last surviving member of the Enola Gay plane crew who dropped the bomb on Hiroshima died at a retirement home in Georgia, aged 93.

Van Kirk was the navigator on the flight that dropped the first nuclear bomb used in warfare. He later told reporters that after seeing one atomic bomb explode in war, he never wanted to see another one used again.

But he defended the use of the bomb, describing it as the lesser of two evils when compared to the continued aerial assault of the Japanese main islands and a planned U.S. invasion.

'The bomb really saved lives, in spite of the tremendous number of casualties in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, because the destruction that would have been caused in Japan otherwise would have been tremendous,' he said in an oral history for Georgia Public Broadcasting.

The US B-29 Superfortress Enola Gay, carrying 12 crew members, dropped the atomic bomb, nicknamed "Little Boy", on Hiroshima in the closing days of World War Two.

The death toll from the blast by the end of the year was estimated at about 140,000, out of the total of 350,000 who lived there at the time.

Three days after the Hiroshima bombing, the United States dropped an atomic bomb nicknamed 'Fat Man' on Nagasaki. Japan surrendered on August 15, 1945, bringing World War Two to an end.

The Pennsylvania-born Van Kirk flew missions in Europe during the war and visited Nagasaki in the aftermath of the atomic blast there.

He studied chemical engineering after the war and became an executive with DuPont.

He said the Hiroshima mission was relatively easy, with no anti-aircraft fire coming from the ground. The big worry was whether the plane would blow up after the bomb detonated, he told Georgia Public Broadcasting.

He said that 43 seconds after the bomb was dropped, he saw a flash from the blast. A shockwave then came and shook the aircraft.

The number of surviving victims, known as 'hibakusha,' was just more than 190,000 this year. Their average age is 79, and many of the attendants at the ceremony were their younger relatives and descendants. Hiroshima officials said 5,507 survivors died over the past year.

The anniversary comes as Japan is divided over Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's recent Cabinet decision to allow the country's military to defend foreign countries and play greater roles overseas.

To achieve the goal, Abe's Cabinet revised its interpretation of Japan's post-WWII pacifist constitution.

Abe said at the event that as the sole country to suffer nuclear attacks, Japan has the duty to seek to eliminate nuclear weapons. But he did not mention his push for a more assertive defense posture.
