A cash-strapped council has launched a cut-price bid to stop sand being blown away from a popular beach - by covering it with Christmas trees.

Officials at Cornwall Council came up with the festive solution after locals complained Porthtowan Beach was being eroded by high winds.

The authority asked residents to donate their old trees then planted them in several rows across the dunes.

Dozens of Christmas trees have been buried on a Cornish beach in a scheme to prevent erosion

They say the pines will act as a temporary wind break and provide shelter which will allow marram grass to grow across the sand.

Grass roots will then bind the dunes together and the trees will eventually be removed.

The council has attempted to manage the dunes in the past by putting up fencing and pathways but says Christmas trees provide a cheap, environmentally friendly alternative.

Councillor Joyce Duffin said: 'The dunes are an important part of the beach environment providing coastal defences and a habitat for a variety of insects, small mammals and birds.

The project, which has met strong opposition from Porthtowan Dunes Group, aims to capture the wind to allow the marram grass to grow and hold the sand togethe

Cornwall Council, which launched the tree planning, said residents would see a difference within a year as the sand dunes took shape

'They are also used by many people for a range of recreational activities and while it's fantastic to see the area is well used and appreciated, unfortunately, over time, these activities have damaged the dune.

'A sustainable way of protecting the dune is to use natural materials to limit sand movement and we hope the trees will be the first step in stabilising the area.'

The plan has split opinion in the coastal village, where residents say the winds whip up sand storms and damage their homes.

Chris Smith, local businessman and a member of the Dune Management Group, dismissed it as a 'crack-pot idea' and called for proper investment in sand defences.

He said: 'We have toyed with this issue for years and we have seen the sand dunes get out of control.

'Consequently there is no sand on the beach as it has spread on to the green and the road.

'Due to a European directive, much of the sand blown on to the nearby green and road has to been taken to a landfill site rather than being returned to the beach.

'The beach is literally being carried away and dumped inland, and this tree burying idea is just another crack-pot idea from the council.'
