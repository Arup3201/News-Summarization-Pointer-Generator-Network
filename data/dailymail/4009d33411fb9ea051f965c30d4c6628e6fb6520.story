A boy of four choked to death in hospital after his nurse went on a two-hour break.

Daniel Hames had acute gastroenteritis but hospital staff were not fully aware of his medical history, an inquest heard.

His mother, Christina Smith, told how she had fallen asleep in a chair beside his bed and woke to find a nurse standing over him.

‘I jumped up and I just saw my son 
lying there,’ she said. ‘He was on his back, not moving. I said to him, 
“Don’t leave me, don’t leave me”.’ But Daniel was already dead. The 
staff nurse who had been monitoring him at Doncaster Royal Infirmary had
 gone on a break after telling a second nurse to carry out observations 
on the child.

But the inquest heard the observations were not done and Daniel was later discovered to have vomited and choked to death.

Assistant coroner John Sleightholme asked a hospital matron if the length of the break was normal.

She
 said: ‘You anticipate a degree of flexibility but the length of time on
 that occasion was not acceptable nor, I am aware, common practice.’ The
 nurse who went on the two-hour break was later sacked after a 
disciplinary hearing.

The inquest heard that Daniel had been admitted the previous day, in March last year, after he began vomiting.

A doctor advised his family to take him home and care for him there, making sure he drank liquids after he stopped being sick.

Hours
 later, however, he had to be taken back to hospital by ambulance and 
admitted to A&E, before being moved to a paediatric ward.

The 
inquest heard he had been ill several times with the same condition the 
year before, spending four days in hospital, and had been sent home from
 school with diarrhoea in February 2013.

But
 staff in the children’s ward did not have access to a system available 
in A&E which brought up a snapshot of the patient’s medical history,
 while the paramedic’s notes about Daniel, who was from Doncaster, were 
not taken to the ward, as they should have been.

At about 7am a doctor was called to Daniel’s cubicle after he was discovered to have vomited.

Despite the best efforts of the medical staff, he was pronounced dead at 7.39am, less than seven hours after being admitted.

Mr
 Sleightholme said ‘communications in some way could have done better’ 
but ruled the death was due to natural causes – acute aspiration of 
stomach contents due to adenoviral gastroenteritis.

The
 hearing, at Doncaster Coroner’s Court, was told that since the tragedy 
Doncaster and Bassetlaw Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust had carried out a
 full investigation and brought in a number of changes.

These
 include a pilot scheme making medical records more easily available 
between 11pm and 7am. A warning system has also been introduced to 
monitor the observation results of children.

Daniel’s
 father, also called Daniel, 29, said after the inquest: ‘He was a 
well-loved and happy child and he is going to be missed by his mum, dad,
 granny and grandad.’
