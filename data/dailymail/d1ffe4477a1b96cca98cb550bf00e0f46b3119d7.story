Freddie Starr has spoken of his 19 months in legal limbo after an investigation into claims he molested a string of women was finally dropped this week.

The entertainer said the more than a year he spent on bail has been 'mental torture' which left him considering suicide and turned him into a physical wreck.

Starr, 71, was first arrested in November 2012, then rearrested three further times in April last year and January and February this year.

But the case against him was dropped this week when prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence to support the claims of 13 women that he molested them up to 40 years ago, which he has always denied.

After looking frail in a press conference outside his home in Studley, Warwickshire earlier this week, Starr has now told how the months spent with the case hanging over him have taken a devastating toll on his health.

He told The Sun's Michael Hamilton: 'This has been like a dark cloak that I have had to wear all the time. It's been mental torture.'

He said the worst thing about his situation was that he could not be left unsupervised with his daughter Ebony, seven, after a 'heart-wrenching' visit from social services.

Starr, who says he has suffered four heart attacks in the past, said the sleepless nights and stress hit his health and left him considering suicide.

His wife Sophie Lea, 33, has been looking after him and, at one point, had to check on him regularly to ensure he didn't try to take his own life, the paper reported.

Starr,
 whose health has deteriorated so much he has needed a wheelchair during
 the investigation, has criticised the authorities after the decision.

Speaking at his Warwickshire village mansion earlier this week, his lawyer Dean Dunham 
said: ‘This will not be the end of this matter. I’ll
 tell you this, we will not be sitting down and letting this go as it is
 now. The police have some questions to answer and they will be 
answering them.'

Long battle: Starr pictured in November 2012

Despite his ailing health, Starr has now vowed to get back to work and says he is considering featuring in a reality TV show.

Starr
 was the second celebrity to be arrested by Scotland Yard’s Operation 
Yewtree when he was held on November 1, 2012. He was re-bailed nine times as the controversial investigation 
engulfed a series of celebrities.

The
 comedian accused police and prosecutors of ‘playing dirty’ by 
associating him with known paedophiles Jimmy Savile and Gary Glitter.

He suspects the announcement of charges being dropped was delayed by the Clifford case, because his
 notorious front page story – ‘Freddie Starr ate my hamster’ – featured 
in the evidence.

But prosecutors insist they only made their final 
decision at the end of last week and did not receive a full case file from police
 until March.

A Crown 
Prosecution Service spokesman told MailOnline today: 'The decision not 
to prosecute was only formalised on the Friday last week.'

'The CPS received initial material from the Metropolitan Police Service regarding these allegations in December 2012.

'Investigative advice was provided to the police throughout 2013 and the final evidence was submitted to the CPS in March 2014.

'The decision to re-bail that month was made for legal reasons.'

After the case was dropped, Starr's lawyer aimed a strongly-worded volley of 
criticism at the authorities whom he accused of orchestrating a 
‘harrowing’ ordeal.

Mr 
Dunham said: ‘It has taken too long; it has not been done properly. We 
presented evidence right at the start of this matter  that we say was 
conclusive to show  that he was not guilty of these allegations.’

Starr
 was one of the most high-profile and outspoken Yewtree suspects and the
 decision to release him is a blow for an inquiry which some have 
branded a ‘witch-hunt’

It came just days after detectives secured 
their first conviction when publicist Max Clifford was found guilty of a
 string of sex attacks.

The
 claims against Starr first came to light just weeks after the Savile 
scandal first emerged in October 2012. Starr made a failed attempt to 
secure a High Court injunction to restrict media reporting of the claim 
and hired private investigators to examine it.

This week's decision leaves only a handful of Yewtree suspects on bail, including Glitter, who was arrested five days before Starr.

Others
 include BBC DJ Paul Gambaccini, and former Radio 1 DJ Chris Denning. 
Comic Jimmy Tarbuck was arrested and spent nearly a year on bail before 
being told he would not face charges, while Jim Davidson was recently 
told he faced no further action.

GUILTY

Max Clifford: The public relations expert was arrested on December 6, 2012. Following
 a trial, he was found guilty last month of eight counts of indecent 
assault stemming from attacks on teenagers dating back more than 40 
years. He was jailed for eight years last week.

NO FURTHER ACTION

Wilfred De’ath:
The former BBC producer was arrested on November 11, 2012 on suspicion 
of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl, but was released without 
charge after a woman withdrew a complaint against him. The
76-year-old has blasted police for being ‘overzealous’, pursuing 
‘spurious’ claims, and failing ‘lamentably’ to stop Savile’s reign
of terror while he was still alive.

Jim Davidson:
The comedian was arrested on January 2, last year on suspicion of 
sexual offences, but the 60-year-old Big Brother winner was later told 
he would not face further action.

Mike Osman:
The 54-year-old radio DJ was arrested in January last year on 
suspicion of sex offences. But he was told he will not face any charges last
August.

Ted Beston: The former BBC radio producer was arrested on December 19, 2012. In May last year it was announced that the 77-year-old would not face any further action.

Jimmy Tarbuck: The 
74-year-old comedian was arrested in April last year over allegations of
 child sex abuse in the 1970s, but released without charge two months 
ago.

David Smith:
The former driver who worked for the BBC was found dead at his home on 
the first day of his trial in October last year. The 67-year-old was 
arrested in December 2012 and charged in April last year with abusing a 
12-year-old boy in 1984.

ONGOING

Dave Lee Travis: The former Radio 1 star – dubbed the 'Hairy Cornflake' – was acquitted on
 12 of 14 sex assault 
charges made against him. He will be retried over two allegations on 
which a jury failed to agree verdicts. And last month he pleaded not 
guilty to a fresh charge of indecently assaulting a woman.

Gary Glitter:
The former pop star was arrested on October 28, 2012, on sex abuse 
allegations. The 69-year-old has now been on bail 
for a year and a half.

Rolf Harris:
The 84-year-old Australian entertainer was questioned under caution on 
November 29, 2012 and then arrested on March 28 last year. He has been 
charged with 12 indecent assaults of young girls and four counts of 
making indecent images of children. The jury in his trial is expected to be sworn in today.   

Paul Gambaccini:
The radio presenter was arrested on October 29 last year on suspicion 
of sexual offences. He has been bailed by police, and denies the allegations.

Chris Denning:
The Radio 1 DJ was first arrested on Monday, June 3. He has since been 
re-arrested twice over alleged sexual offences. He has been
bailed, and denies the allegations.

PUBLIC FIGURES CLEARED AFTER OTHER INVESTIGATIONS (NOT OPERATION YEWTREE)

Michael Le Vell: The 
Coronation Street actor was cleared last September of various child sex 
abuse charges, including rape. He had denied 12 charges in total at 
Manchester Crown Court

William Roache: The Coronation Street actor was cleared in February of sex charges 
dating back to the 1960s. The 81-year-old always maintained his 
innocence and blamed hysteria after the Jimmy Savile scandal for 
'money-grabbing' women who falsely accused him of sex offences.

Nigel Evans: The 
former deputy speaker, a Conservative first elected to Parliament in 
1992, was cleared of rape and sexual assault last month following a 
trial. A jury at Preston Crown Court cleared him of nine counts of rape, sexual assault and indecent assault.
