The BBC could lose millions of pounds a year if it sacks Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson 

The BBC is set to lose as much as £67million a year if Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson is sacked over claims he punched a producer.

The corporation's commercial arm rakes in an estimated £50million a year from selling the rights to Top Gear overseas, with the show watched in 214 countries around the world.

On top of that, BBC Worldwide makes millions more from Top Gear Magazine and live shows in the UK and abroad, as well as sales of DVDs.

But all of this could be lost if Clarkson is sacked - an outcome he hinted at during a charity ball last night.

The Top Gear star, who is alleged to have hit producer Oisin Tymon during a 'fracas' over a steak dinner, said he wanted to do one more lap of the show's track 'before the 'f****** b******* sack me'.

The BBC could lose tens of millions of pounds in annual profit if they do give Clarkson his marching orders, with the sale of the show overseas making £50million.

Top Gear Magazine has a global circulation of 1.7m, bringing in another estimated £7.4million - not including profit from advertising, as well as the costs of producing and shipping the magazine.

The motoring programme is also set to make around £7.35million in sales of tickets to its 14 live shows in the UK this year. 

The conservative estimate is based on 15,000 tickets sold for each show at the cheapest price of £35 each, however with more expensive tickets and VIP packages available, this figure could be far higher. Car manufacturers are also thought to pay to have their cars featured on the stadium tours. 

The programme's 2014 Christmas DVD - Top Gear Perfect Road Trip 2 - was the highest-selling in the UK, with 272,000 copies bought in just three months, accounting for about £2.17million.

Other DVDs, Top Gear merchandise and mobile apps are other sources of revenue that could be cut off if the show comes to and end with the sacking of Clarkson, with Richard Hammond and James May refusing to film without their suspended co-presenter.

Last night the Top Gear frontman was caught on camera as he launched into a foul-mouthed rant at the BBC during a charity gala.

Rant: Clarkson, pictured next to Pink Floyd's Nick Mason, hinted that he expects to be sacked by the BBC

Clarkson, speaking in north London to raise money to help disadvantaged youths, said he wanted to do one more lap of the show's track 'before the 'f****** b******* sack me'.

He told guests at The Roundhouse Gala that the driving series 'was a great show and they've f***** it up'.

A video of his speech emerged as it was claimed last night that Clarkson visited his producer's home to apologise for their Top Gear altercation - but was given the cold shoulder.

In footage obtained by the Daily Mirror, he spoke to the Roundhouse audience about a charity auction for his 'last ever lap' on the Top Gear track - which later went for £100,000.

Clarkson said: 'I didn't foresee my sacking, but I would like to do one last lap. So I'll go down to Surrey and I'll do one last lap of that track before the f****** b******* sack me.

'I'll be a bit tearful when I do it, but f*** it, let's do it. And I'll drive somebody around in whatever I can get hold of. I'm sacked so it's probably an Austin Maestro.'

He added: 'There was an 18-year waiting list to be in the audience of Top Gear, but the BBC has f***** themselves.'

Hosts: Although Top Gear has been taken off air, Clarkson and his co-presenters Richard Hammond (left) and James May (right) are still scheduled to host a Top Gear Live arena show in Norway next week

Last night, a report claimed that the BBC probe into the row had been told producer Oisin Tymon refused to even open the door to Clarkson after he turned up at his house. 

Sources said the incident happened four days after 54-year-old Clarkson allegedly punched Mr Tymon during an argument after filming over a hot meal at a North Yorkshire hotel.

The claims emerged as it was revealed Clarkson, Hammond and May are still scheduled to host a Top Gear Live arena show in Norway next week.

Clarkson is still suspended by the BBC pending a report into what happened during the hotel altercation. The internal probe will be passed to Director-General Lord Hall next week before a final decision is made.

Today, the BBC was given another reminder of the strength of support behind Clarkson when a million-strong petition calling for his reinstatement was delivered to its headquarters - by tank.

The vehicle, apparently driven by the motoring show's enigmatic professional driver The Stig, made its way from Westminster, through central London and towards New Broadcasting House near Oxford Street.

Fans were pictured rallying to support the delivery of the Change.org petition, started by political website Guido Fawkes.

The petition, launched last week, reads: 'We the undersigned petition the BBC to reinstate Jeremy Clarkson. Freedom to fracas. #BringBackClarkson'.' 

It was reported this week that Clarkson's Top Gear co-hosts declined an offer to continue the rest of the series without him.
