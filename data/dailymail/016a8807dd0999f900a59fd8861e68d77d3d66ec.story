Leon Brittan has been buried after a 'very private' funeral with cemetery staff told not to reveal his grave's location amid vandalism fears, it has been claimed.

In accordance with Jewish tradition, the former home secretary is said to have been interred in an simple plot without flowers in Golders Green Cemetery, north London.

However, staff at the facility say they have been asked only to allow people to visit the site when granted permission by Lord Brittan's widow Diana, according to investigative website Exaro.

Following his death last month, critics feared the truth over whether or not Lord Brittan  deliberately withheld evidence from police would never surface.

The 75-year-old died on January 22 before ever being questioned over accusations he concealed a dossier of evidence that incriminated senior politicians in the sexual abuse of boys in the 1980s. 

The alleged abuse at a luxury block of flats in central London is now the subject of a Home Office inquiry.

According to Exaro, Lord Brittan was buried on Wednesday, January 28. 

An employee at Golders Green Cemetery told the website: 'It is an unmarked grave. I need the permission of his family to take anyone down to the grave.

'We have to respect the family's wishes.' 

It is customary not to visit a grave until after an initial period of mourning, and a headstone is unveiled up to a year after death. 

Lord Brittan served as Home Secretary in Margaret Thatcher's government between 1983 and 1985. 

During this time he is accused of witnessing the murder of a boy by two politicians at an apartment in Dolphin Square, the setting of the alleged routine sexual abuse of children. 

In 1984, he was said to have been given a dossier of evidence by campaigning MP Geoffrey Dickens which incriminated several senior politicians in a paedophile ring.

Lord Brittan insisted he passed the documents on to the relevant authorities, though they have never been found.  

Following fresh accounts from men claiming to have been abused as boys at the property, an inquiry into an alleged Westminster paedophile ring was launched. 

It has been repeatedly delayed as officials struggle to find an appropriate person to lead proceedings.

Lady Butler-Sloss, the first appointed chairwoman, was forced to resigned in July last year. She is the sister of Sir Michael Havers who served as attorney general in the 80s. 

Fiona Woolf was selected to replace her but stepped down after admitting she lived on the same street as Lord Brittan and his wife. 

This week the Home Office announced that Lowell Goddard would take her place. 

Previously Simon Danczuk, the MP who exposed Cyril Smith as a paedophile after being contacted by his victims, said Lord Brittan's death could impede the inquiry. 

'Lord Brittan’s death will make it that much harder for the truth to come out about the missing “Dickens dossier” and the alleged cover-up of a Westminster paedophile ring in the 1980s,' he said.

Pressure is mounting on Theresa May to get the inquiry underway following a series of set-backs
