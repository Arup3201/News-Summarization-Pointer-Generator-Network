Former Playboy bunny Holly Madison is accusing a Las Vegas showgirl theater of making secret naked dressing room recordings of her and dancers. 

The reality TV star claims that managers at Mandalay Bay's 1923 Bourbon and Burlesque  filmed, transmitted and disseminated images of the women naked and changing costumes for about five months last year without the women's knowledge or consent. 

Robert W. Sabes, Noel Bowman, Robert Fry and Avi Kopelman, the individuals named in the suit, are accused of secretly placing a digital video recorder capable of storing 17 days of film in the women's changing room, reports Review Journal.

The suit alleges Madison, who was once one of Playboy magnate Hugh Hefner's 'Girls Next Door, became aware of the alleged filming when two other showgirls noticed the camera’s feed in their manager’s office and complained

Video was then streamed to the men's computers and other digital devices, according to the lawsuit. 

The camera was apparently in the hallway where the women got changed.

According to the filing, he told them it had been recording them since April and when Madison's agent, Jason Verona complained, Sabes responded: It's not a big deal.'

The women all quit the show shortly afterward. 

'No evidence exists that images were captured or published,'  said attorney Jared Kahn, who represents the club.

He said the camera problem camera situation was resolved as soon as it was discovered. 

'This is a publicity stunt by Holly to promote her upcoming book and attempt to extract a seven-figure settlement from 1923,' he said. 

In December, the Las Vegas Sun reported that Madison’s name had been removed from all recent marketing materials and the club’s official website.

It reported that although she did not plan to feature in every show, she had not appeared at Bourbon & Burlesque since Spring.

Madison, who previously starred in the burlesque Peep Show in Las Vegas, married filmmaker Pasquale Rotella in Disneyland in September 2013, after the birth of her Rainbow Aurora. 

The couple began dating in 2011.
