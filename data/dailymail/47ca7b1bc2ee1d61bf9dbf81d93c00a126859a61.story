The wife of a disgraced Chinese diplomat accused of murdering a British businessman has 'already been found guilty' before her trial begins, analysts believe.

Gu Kailai, 53, wife of the formerly popular politician Bo Xilai, is accused with an aide, Zhang Xiaojun, of killing 41-year-old Neil Heywood with poison in November last year.

It is understood that they fell out over a money issue and the former lawyer believed the businessman, a long-time associate of the family, threatened her son’s safety.

'Guilty': Gu Kailai, wife of China's former Chongqing Municipality Communist Party Secretary Bo, has already had her fate decided after being accused of killing British businessman Neil Heywood

But analysts have predicted that Mrs Gu's fate has already been decided before it reaches the Hefei court, The Daily Telegraph reported.

The trial, which the Chinese government have not commented on, is now meant to work in 'reverse' - with the trial reflecting the already decided decision.

Professor Willy Lam, a China expert from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, told The Telegraph that he believed it would be practically 'impossible' for Mrs Gu's defence team to overturn the decision.

The Telegraph reported that Chinese government sources implied Communist Party leaders were anxious about shows of public support for Mrs Gu’s husband, Mr Bo.

The source said that Beijing will 
send hundreds of security personnel and plainclothes police officers 
around the Hefei Intermediate People’s Court in the Anhui province.

However, because of her husband's position, experts predict she will not receive the death sentence, should she be found guilty.

British businessman Neil Heywood was initially thought to have died form alcohol abuse, but then officials began investigating and suspected poison could be involved

Bo Xilai, 63, the former Communist Party chief in the city of Chongqing who was once considered a strong contender for membership of the nine-member Politburo Standing Committee and possible future leader of the country.

He was sacked from his position in March after allegations surfaced linking Mrs Gu to Mr Heywood's death, and he remains under investigation by the party over corruption claims.

Mrs Gu was detained in mid-April and neither she or her husband have been seen since. 

Their son, Bo Guagua, 24, is believed to be in the United States after graduating from his master’s degree in public policy at Harvard earlier this year.

Mr Heywood's death in a Chongqing hotel last November was initially ruled accidental, and put down to alcohol abuse, though friends said that Mr Heywood was not a big drinker.

But murder suspicions came to the fore after a former Chongqing police chief visited a US consulate in China and divulged information allegedly linking Mrs Gu to Mr Heywood's death.

It was later suspected that he might have died from cyanide poisoning.

The case has convulsed China's political world ahead of the expected handover of power to a younger generation of leaders at the Communist Party's five-yearly National Congress in Beijing this autumn.

UK diplomats have been given permission to attend the trial, it was disclosed today.

The Foreign Office said British officials will attend the trial which begins on August 9 in the eastern city of Hefei.

It is considered unusual for foreign observers to be granted access to such politically sensitive court cases in China.

'We can confirm that British diplomats will attend the trial,' said the Foreign Office.

A spokesman said: 'The details of the ongoing investigation are a matter for the Chinese authorities.

'However we are glad to see that the Chinese authorities are continuing with the investigation into the death of Neil Heywood. We are dedicated to seeking justice for him and his family and we will be following developments closely.'
