The Daleks invaded Buckingham Palace as stars of Doctor Who past and present attended a reception to mark the 50th anniversary of the show.

Four Time Lords in total - Matt Smith, Tom Baker, Peter Davison and John Hurt - were in attendance at the event hosted by the Countess of Wessex, who herself has been fan of the show since she was a child.

Props from the show, including two versions of the Tardis, a pair of Daleks and K-9 the robot dog, were set up in the Palace’s Bow Room.

Speaking this afternoon Matt Smith, who plays the eleventh Doctor and whose stint as the Doctor ends this year when he will be replaced by Peter Capaldi, said he was 'really thrilled' to be invited along and admitted that part of him regretted quitting.

He said: 'You know, just seeing all my old friends who I work with, they’re all here, and the kids having a good time and the actors...

'It’s a great job but I left, so no point crying over spilt milk, is there?'

The actor also said he would not rule out a return on another anniversary: 'Who knows, in another 50 years, if they let me come back, I will, and as of Christmas Day it falls to Peter and I wish him all the best.' 

The hostess: The Countess of Wessex looked to be in her element as she mingled with cast and crew of Doctor Who past and present

Sophie looked chic and elegant in a long sleeved berry red figure hugging dress with scalloped neck and nude suede courts.  

Her
hair tied neatly off her face Sophie chatted to cast members and crew 
and and even invited the Daleks and had the Tardis drafted in for the 
event.

Jenna-Louise Coleman - the current Doctor's companion, Clara Oswald - wore her 
brunette hair loose and a pretty dusty pink drop waist dress with black 
flowered print.

Tom Baker, who played the fourth Doctor, 
said the show's appeal was down to the fact the character was not a 'do-gooder' but could be 'naughty', 'cynical' and 'very silly' and said 
it was the highlight of his career.

He
said: 'Everything as an actor after Doctor Who was a little bit 
downhill really so what it meant was going from Doctor Who to Macbeth or
An Inspector Calls, it was just Doctor Who up there all the time and I 
used to go on and do it in the style of Doctor Who and all the other 
actors would hate me but I couldn't help that.

'I didn't do it for the 
other actors, I did it for whoever bought the ticket.'

John Hurt,
who will appear in the 50th anniversary special as a previously-unknown incarnation of the 
time lord, said he first became interested in the show because Baker 'used to talk about it with such enthusiasm.'

He said: 'He was absolutely obsessed with it and now I realise if you're playing the Doctor you would be.'

Davison
is not appearing in the anniversary episode, but did say he had been 
busy working on a 'project that will be around on Saturday' and 
available for fans through the BBC but declined to go into detail.

The event took place just a few days before the
series reaches its 50th milestone, when the BBC will screen a special 
episode titled The Day of the Doctor.

To celebrate Doctor Who's 50th 
anniversary, the BBC has planned a slew of special programming with the 
centrepiece of that being The Day of the Doctor.

The anniversary special will star John Hurt as the ‘War Doctor’, 
introduced at the end of the Doctor Who series that aired earlier this year.

The details are few and far between, but a trailer and a recently-aired mini-episode, The Night of The Doctor, give some clues about what is to come.

At least three Doctors - outgoing Doctor Matt Smith, his predecessor David Tennant and new but old Doctor John Hurt - appear in the special, but they may not be the only ones.

Others attending the reception for cast and crew included current star Jenna-Louise Coleman.

Sophie also met young competition winners from two Cardiff schools where scenes from the 50th episode were filmed.

The pupils were asked to come up with drawings of The Queen’s Tardis, with the winning pictures on show at the reception today.

Doctor Who holds the Guinness World Record for the longest-running science fiction series in the world.

The drama first aired on November 23 1963 with William Hartnell starring as the Doctor. Depicting the adventures of a time-travelling Time Lord known as the Doctor who explores the universe in his Tardis, the original series ran, with six more actors in the title role, until 1989.

Two of the seven 'classic series' Doctors were there today: Tom Baker, who played the fourth Doctor from 1974 to 1981, and Peter Davison, the fifth Doctor, who took the role from 1981-1984

The series was revived in 2005 to great acclaim, winning the 2006 British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series 
and five consecutive (2005–2010) awards at the National Television 
Awards.

Doctor Who holds the Guinness World Record for the longest-running science fiction series in the world, celebrating its 50th 
birthday this Saturday. 

Matt Smith has played the lead role since 2010 but will leave the series in this year’s Christmas special.

Catherine Tate, who was also at today's reception, appeared as Donna Noble between 2008 and 2010, opposite David Tennant’s Doctor.
