Ulrika the mother: With daughter Bo, 13, last year 

Trying to discipline your children is a challenge for any parent…especially if your spouse then undermines all your hard work by spoiling them with gifts.

But when you have four offspring by four different fathers like Ulrika Jonsson, it seems that agreeing on some basic parenting ground rules becomes virtually impossible.

The presenter, 47, has spoken of the ‘nightmare’ of controlling her children’s internet access when her ex-lovers shower them with hi-tech gadgets and smartphones that allow them to go online whenever they like.

Jonsson revealed that her oldest daughter Bo, 13, has a mobile phone ‘much against my better judgment’, while her youngest Martha was given an iPod by her father at the tender age of ten.

And she said she was ‘utterly horrified’ when her eldest son Cameron, 19, from her first marriage to cameraman John Turnbull, admitted he had watched online porn when he was just 14.

The Swedish-born star said she now feels incapable of protecting them from graphic and sexually explicit material on her own because it is so easy for them to access the Internet.

She told Hello!: ‘In my household things have changed greatly over the last few years. My oldest son, who’s nearing 20, is capable of regulating himself.

‘My oldest daughter, who is about 14, has had, much against my better judgment, an iPod since she was 11 and a mobile phone since she was 12.

‘At first her mobile wasn’t a smartphone but times have moved on and so, it appears, has she.

‘My ten-year-old daughter was given an iPod by her father last Christmas, and my six-year-old boy can access the family iPad.’

Jonsson married her third husband, advertising executive Brian Monet, in 2008. He is father to her youngest son Malcolm.

Martha was born to her second husband Lance Gerrard-Wright, whom she divorced in 2006. Jonsson never married Bo’s father, German hotel manager Marcus Kempen, and they split shortly after her birth.

The presenter said she welcomed a new Government pilot scheme which will see music videos on YouTube and music platform Vevo classified by the British Board of Film Certification for age suitability.

But she admitted she wished she had started worrying about the issue many years ago. She said: ‘Four years ago, none of the nightmares of policing my children’ s access existed. But they should have done because my 19-year-old confessed to me last year that he had viewed porn on the Internet when he was about 14.

‘I was utterly horrified and felt a fool for being too trusting and not savvy enough.’

Jonsson said the only influence she has over her children is to inform them about the risks of the Internet, but said she was unable to stop Bo setting up a Facebook account of her own accord.

She said: ‘When we found out, she was made to understand in no uncertain terms why she couldn’t have one and why we need to know what she does on the Internet.’

Jonsson added: ‘I, alone, cannot protect them from everything, including the content they have at their fingertips and which they absorb unwittingly. What they view on the Internet enters their psyches and I would do them a grave injustice if I didn’t alert them to the fact that not all of it is good.’
