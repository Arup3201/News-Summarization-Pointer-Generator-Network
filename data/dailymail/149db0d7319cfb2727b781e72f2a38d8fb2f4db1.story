Manchester United and Arsenal's hopes of signing Mats Hummels have been severely dented after Borussia Dortmund announced the German World Cup winner as their new club captain.

Both Premier League clubs wanted to sign the 25-year-old but the Bundesliga outfit have tried to end the tug of war for their star centre back.

Dortmund took to Twitter after their 4-0 loss to Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday to reveal Hummels as their new skipper with team-mates Roman Weidenfeller and Marco Reus his deputies.

It means Louis van Gaal and United are likely to turn to Holland defender Daley Blind with Ajax set to sell for about £17m. 

Hummels was at the forefront of the former Holland manager's interests, after his performances helped Germany become World Champions in Brazil. 

United, though, will move on swiftly and pursue £25m-rated Colombia forward Juan Cuadrado from Fiorentina. 

Arsenal joined the race for Hummels after selling Thomas Vermaelen, who was also wanted by Van Gaal, to Barcelona for £15m.
