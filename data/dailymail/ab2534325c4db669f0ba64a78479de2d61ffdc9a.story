Each child needs a bedroom to themselves to fulfil their academic potential, the Education Secretary has said.

Michael Gove said having a ‘room of one’s own’ provided space to learn and read.

But he was immediately accused of hypocrisy as critics pointed out that new Government rules decree a child aged under 16 in a home receiving housing benefit has to share a room with a sibling of the same gender.

The so-called ‘bedroom tax’ also means that brothers and sisters will have to share rooms until the age of ten.

Mr Gove said more children will be able to enjoy having their own bedroom in future because of the Government’s planning reforms, which aim to encourage the building of larger properties.

Developers have been urged to end the proliferation of ‘rabbit hutch’ estates and develop family-sized homes.

The Education Secretary told an audience at the Policy Exchange think-tank: ‘My colleague, [planning minister] Nicholas Boles, is making changes to the planning regime.

‘These are changes which are social justice changes. Virginia Woolf wrote about a room of one’s own and about the fact that throughout history women did not have a chance to fulfil their potential because they did not have a room of their own in which to write.

‘There are schoolchildren who do not have rooms of their own in which to do their homework, in which to read, in which to achieve their full potential. Nick Boles’ planning reforms will make it easier for more homes of a larger size to be built for children.’

Mr Gove lashed out at ‘nimbys’ who tried to block the liberalisation of planning laws, adding: ‘When people oppose these planning reforms, I think they are actually standing in the way of helping our children to grow tall.’

But Liam Byrne, Labour’s work and pensions spokesman, seized on the Education Secretary’s remarks, saying: ‘Even Michael Gove now admits that the bedroom tax is a vicious policy that holds children back.

‘This hated policy should be dropped and dropped now.’

Mr Gove was supported yesterday by Mr Boles, who criticised councils which use protecting the greenbelt as an ‘excuse’ not to build new homes.
