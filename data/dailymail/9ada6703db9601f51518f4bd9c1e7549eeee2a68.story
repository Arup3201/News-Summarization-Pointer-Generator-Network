The owner of an Asian restaurant cancelled a same-sex wedding party because ‘gay partiers are bad for feng shui’, according to a lawsuit.

Barrett Greene, 50, and Thomas Eng, 38, claimed the manager at fusion restaurant Amber Village in Manhattan, New York, violated their civil rights.

They allegedly met manager Tommy Ho to plan a rehearsal dinner for 40 people and reception food for 200 guests - but this was later cancelled.

Plumbing contractor Mr Greene and IT worker Mr Eng met in 2004 and decided to marry this summer, reported the New York Daily News.

In March they met Mr Ho, who took a $750 (£462) deposit, but he called one week later to say the dinner needed to be moved to another branch.

However later that day a senior manager named Mr Fong then ‘told Ho that he didn’t want any “gay parties” at Amber Village', the lawsuit claimed.

The lawsuit also said: ‘Fong instructed Ho to “make an excuse” and tell Greene that his rehearsal dinner could not take place at Amber Village.

Surprising: The Amber Village restaurant is in the West Village of Manhattan, which is known for being one of New York City's most gay-friendly areas

‘Fong also told Ho that it's “very bad” 
for Amber Village to book “gay parties” and that big groups of “gay 
partiers” are especially bad for feng shui.’

Lawsuit filed in Manhattan

Then Mr Fong fired Mr Ho, the lawsuit said. Mr Ho has not yet commented on the case. Neither has restaurant owner Qi Yeng Lin.

The restaurant - which is part of a small chain - where the couple first planned to have their party closed in June.

But the manager at its new location, Bo Lee, told the New York Daily News feng shui has ‘nothing to do with clients’, adding: ‘We don’t turn away anyone. We have gay managers.’

The Amber Village restaurant is located in the West Village of Manhattan, which is known for being one of New York City’s most gay-friendly areas.

Feng shui is an ancient Chinese method of creating a harmonious environment through the strategic positioning of objects in a room.

Mr Greene and Mr Eng are seeking damages and 
also claim the restaurant didn't refund their deposit, 
reported the New York Daily News.

They married in June in a ceremony at the Midtown Loft and Terrace.
