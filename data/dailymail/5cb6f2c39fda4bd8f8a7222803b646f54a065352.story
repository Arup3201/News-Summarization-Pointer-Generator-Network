Adam Lanza, the young man who grow up to kill 27 people, including 20 school children and his own mother, is seen for the first time as a four-year-old boy in a family video.

In home video obtained exclusively by the Hartford Courant and PBS’ Frontline, a young Lanza is seen in 1996 at a police demonstration with the Scouts.

The young Lanza wanders through the woods as his mother, Nancy, tells him off camera to bark like a dog, imitating the dog barks around him.

A family friend also revealed that there was ‘a weirdness about him,’ saying that Lanza hated to be touched, whether it was a pat on the back or a high five from a classmate.

The Frontline program, ‘Raising Adam Lanza,’ airs tonight on PBS at 10pm EST, and will offer interviews with the family and friends of the Lanzas and attempt to explain the beginnings of how the 20-year-old could go and commit one of the worst school shootings in U.S. history.

Nancy once told close family friend Marvin LaFontaine not to touch Adam, as he displayed deep discomfort from human contact.

‘There was a weirdness about him,’ he told Frontline, saying that his handicap was putting a large stress on his mother. ‘She didn’t know what to do.’ He was also diagnosed with sensory integration disorder, a condition that makes it hard to respond and react to sensory stimulation.

The condition is not widely known, and experts are divided over the condition.

When he reached school age, Lanza had trouble fitting in, and as a result, his mother shuffled him from one special needs program to another, taking him in and out of various schools.

The special Frontline episode will also examine the complicated life of the shooter's mother, Nancy Lanza, who was his first victim on December 14

‘We wanted to learn about Nancy Lanza,’ the Hartford Courant’s Alaine Griffin told the TODAY show.

‘She had done a number of things to get Adam in the right place. She actually was trying to do the right thing by Adam, whether or not that was the right thing.’

She explained that Nancy Lanza’s place in the shooting is embattled – while she was shot in the head at close range on December 14, she was not included in the memorials for the 20 students and six Sandy Hook staffers killed on that day in Newtown.

Ms Griffin added that many think of Nancy as an extreme survivalist who let her son’s issues mutate until she could not control him – and suffered fatal consequences. 

Others sympathize with a mother who tried to give her son the help he needed but could not give him the care his condition required.

A new report also claims that Lanza, 20, targeted Sandy Hook Elementary School because he believed it was the best place for him to shoot as many people as possible to rival the 77 lives claimed by Norwegian extremest Anders Behring Breivik in 2011.

A new report suggests that Lanza, who killed 27 people, meant to top the number of murders committed by Norwegian mass-murderer Anders Behring Breivik, right, in 2011

Lanza targeted two first grade classrooms at Sandy Hook Elementary School and killed 20 students as well as six teachers and administrators on December 14

Breivik also targeted young people in his 2011 mass shooting in Norway, killing 69 at a youth summer camp organized by the Labor Party and eight more in a car bombing

CBS News quotes two anonymous officials with inside knowledge of the police investigation as saying Sandy Hook offered the 'easiest target' and the 'largest cluster of people' for him to attack.

The Connecticut State Police dismissed the CBS report as 'pure speculation' and said the assertions about Breivik are not true.

Lanza left no note explaining his motives and smashed his hard drive before for the shooting, leaving few clues about why he killed his mother Nancy Lanza in her bed and then shot his way through the school.

Police believe Lanza may have been playing out a scenario in one of his favorite video games and was obsessed with achieving a higher 'score' than Breivik by killing even more people, according to CBS.

Both Lanza and Breivik apparently shared a love of the Call of Duty - the realistic combat shooting game and used it as 'training' for the deadly massacres.

Detectives found thousands of dollars worth of video games in a den with darkened windows where Lanza spent hours playing.

Both killers also used American-made .223-caliber assault rifles. Breivik armed himself with a Ruger Mini-14 rifle. Lanza used a Bushmaster AR-15.

The murders of 20 first graders and six teachers shocked the nation and horrified the quiet community of Newtown

Breivik, 32 at the time, shocked the world in July 2011 
when he planted a car bomb in downtown Oslo, Norway, and then attacked a
summer camp run by the country's Labor Party.

Eight people died in the bomb blast and 204 were injured. Breivik shot dead 67 people and wounded 33 more.

He was later taken alive by police and said he carried out the attacks to combat socialism and the immigration of Muslims to Norway.

He was sentenced to 21 years in prison, though his prison term can be extended every five years, meaning it is highly unlikely Breivik will ever be released.

Unlike Breivik, Lanza would not be taken alive. He reportedly fired several rounds at police cars as they arrived on the scene, and then shot himself in the head.

He was found dead by police who swept through the school building

Along with the video games, Lanza also learned how to fire guns during numerous sessions with his 
mother at a shooting range, where the two 'bonded, the Hartford Courant
reported on Sunday.

Her landscaper, Dan Holmes, told the paper: 'She said she took her kids target shooting, that they bonded over that.'

Nancy was seen as a dedicated
mother to Adam, who had been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome and a 
sensory integration disorder - an aversion to bright lights and loud 
noises.

She had enrolled and pulled Adam into 
numerous schools over the years after growing unsatisfied with the 
education he was receiving.

Second row: Jesse Lewis, Olivia Engel, Josephine Gay, Charlotte Bacon, Chase Kowalski. Third row: Daniel Barden, Jack Pinto, Catherine Hubbard, Dylan Hockley, Benjamin Wheeler. Fourth row: Grace McDonnell, James Mattioli, Avielle Richman, Rachel Davino, Anne Marie Murphy. Fifth row: Lauren Rousseau, Mary Sherlach, Victoria Soto, Dawn Hochsprung, Nancy Lanza

She was planning a move to Washington state with the hopes of getting her son back into a college program. But Lanza also received an education on weapons from his mother, who took him target shooting at a gun range for years.

Richard
Novia, a security chief in the Newtown School system who moderated the 
tech club - of which Adam had been a member - said he disagreed with 
Nancy Lanza's recreation with her son.

He told the Courant: 'It's a serious mistake, first of all. If you have
a child in the home with mental disorders, or learning disabilities, to
have involved him with guns in the first place would be bad.'

Days
after the Sandy Hook shooting, Nancy Lanza's sister-in-law Marsha 
revealed that she had traveled to nine cities in three countries because
she wanted out of the mansion she shared with her troubled son Adam - 
and could have known the end was coming.

It is believed that Nancy - who was 
suffering from multiple sclerosis - wanted to downsize and find a place 
for him to go to college as she was tired of home schooling the troubled
20-year-old.
