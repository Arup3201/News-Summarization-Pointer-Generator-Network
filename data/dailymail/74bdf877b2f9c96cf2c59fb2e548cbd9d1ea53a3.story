Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkēvičs has made a major political statement by coming out as gay

Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkēvičs has revealed he is gay in a tweet posted in English to his 14,000 followers. 

In the tweet published at around 8pm GMT, the minister said: 'I proudly announce I am gay...good luck all of you.

'Our country has to create a legal status for all kinds of partner relationships, and I will fight for this. I know that there will quickly be mega-hysteria, but #proudtobegay.'

The revelation is a major political statement as Latvia is one of a handful of EU countries that has a ban on same-sex marriage.

There is open hostility to gay people in the country and they are often attacked in the streets or in meeting places. 

Elsewhere, a law that would confine sex education in schools to traditional opposite-sex marriage is making its way through Parliament.

A Russian-style bill banning 'gay propaganda' is also being prepared.

The announcement came less than two months before Latvia assumes the European Union’s rotating presidency on January 1, giving Mr Rinkēvičs an even higher-profile platform from which to push for more tolerance for same-sex relationships.  

Latvia enacted a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage in 2005, and very few gay men and lesbians in the country are open about their sexuality. 

Many people in Latvia have prejudices against homosexuality, usually rooted in social conservatism and lingering preconceptions dating from the Soviet period. 

The Latvian Foreign Minister, one of the country's most popular politicians, has revealed he is gay on Twitter

A spokesman confirmed the authenticity of the post. 

The 41-year-old is one of Latvia’s most popular politicians and had long declined to discuss his personal life.

He is a member of the ruling Unity party and since 2011 has been foreign minister of the Baltic nation of two million people.

The announcement comes a day after his post as foreign minister was confirmed as part of Latvia's new government. The nation held parliamentary elections last month.
