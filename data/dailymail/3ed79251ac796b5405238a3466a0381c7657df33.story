North Korean Leader Kim Jong-Un has made his first public appearance in five weeks, ending a prolonged absence that fuelled speculation about his health and control over the country.

The country's official news agency said Kim ‘gave field guidance’ yesterday at the newly-built Wisong Scientists Residential District, adding that he had also visited the newly built Natural Energy Institute of the State Academy of Sciences earlier in the day.

The mystery over Kim’s whereabouts for the past five weeks has deepened as a surprise new claim emerged suggesting he was receiving drastic weight loss treatment in China.

A source told the Daily Mail that the 31-year-old had spent the past few weeks in a Beijing hospital having his stomach tied, or ‘banded’, to help him fight his weight gain.

Last month it was claimed Kim has been putting his health at serious risk due to his dangerously high consumption of Emmental cheese, which he got a taste for while a student in Switzerland.

Weight loss: Kim Jong-un has finally resurfaced with the help of a walking stick. He looked notably slimmer than he did during his last public appearance five weeks ago, amid rumours he has had a gastric band fitted

Last appearance: The North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un was last photographed in public on September 3 at a concert (above centre, with his wife Ri Sol-Ju). He has since missed several high-profile events

Joy: Kim Jong-un inspects a substance believed to be cheese at a North Korean factory. A unhealthy appetite for imported Emmental is believed to be a key factor in Kim's weight ballooning in recent months

Issues: While away from the public eye, Kim was reported to be suffering everything from gout, diabetes, a brain haemorrhage, a heart ailment, a leg injury, mental illness or a cheese addiction

Kim had last been seen in the state media five weeks ago at a concert on September 3, and he missed several high-profile events that he normally attends.

An official documentary released late last month then made a single reference to Kim's ‘discomfort’ and showed video footage from August of him badly overweight and limping.

Now a reputable source, who has connections with intelligence agencies in the West, said Kim’s no-show at the recent 69th anniversary celebrations of the ruling Korean Workers’ Party was due to his recovery in a Chinese hospital having earlier undergone a gastric band operation

He has also been treated in recent weeks for sprains or fractures, to his ankles - a problem that developed after he injured a leg while joining troops in a military exercise in August.

It has since been speculated that, as he continued to limp around, his weight added to the pressure on both legs, resulting in him seeking medical treatment for both that injury and his weight gain.

A unhealthy appetite for Emmental, also known as Swiss cheese, is believed to be a key factor in Kim's weight ballooning in recent months. 

Weight gain: North Korean leader Kim Jong-un got a taste for cheese while a student in Switzerland. He is understood to love it so much that he imports vast quantities despite Western sanctions

Trim Jong-un: Kim's five-week absence fuelled speculation about his health and even rumours of a coup. He made his return to the public eye yesterday, looking slimmer and assisted by a walking stick

At the tour of the residential district, Kim praised the North's scientists as ‘patriots who are devoting all their lives to building a rich and powerful nation, convinced that though there is no frontier in science, they have a socialist motherland and are under the care of the mother party.’

No fan of the limelight in his later years: Kim's late father, Kim Jong-Il (above), would disappear at times

Many analysts believe that while Kim may have some health issues, he is probably not in serious trouble. But many other people wonder.

Experts believe Kim may have been deliberately gaining weight in order to look more like his late grandfather Kim Il-sung, who is venerated in North Korea as the nation's founder and still holds the title Eternal President of the Republic, despite having died 20 years ago. 

Following the leader's public re-emergence yesterday, the North Korean Ambassador in London, Hyon Hak Bong, told the BBC that there was ‘no doubt about it’ that Kim was healthy.

The Ambassador’s comment that Kim was healthy would still hold true even if the leader was in hospital, as stomach banding would be classified as cosmetic, rather than treatment for an illness.

The North Korean regime has made no mention of Kim being in Beijing and the claim by the source - a former government official of a European country who retains close ties with Western intelligence agencies - could not be independently verified.

But Pyongyang officials have admitted that Kim has been suffering ‘discomfort’ - while emphasising that he is still very much in control of the country.

Kim Jong-un's unhealthy obsession with Emmental has led to him importing vast quantities of the cheese for his own consumption - despite millions of North Koreans struggling to find enough to eat.

Not un-well: TV monitors in South Korea show a news report about the health of the North Korean leader. The captions mockingly refer to the 'Honorable Kim Jong-un'

Adored: Earlier this year it was revealed that Kim Jong-un tried to send a team of food experts to the French city of Besancon for a crash course in dairy production so he would no longer have to import his cheese

There's also nothing particularly unusual about North Korean leaders laying low for extended periods.

Kim's late father, Kim Jong-Il, no fan of the limelight in his later years, would disappear at times; Kim Jong-Un, who seems to genuinely like being at the centre of things, took off without a word for three weeks in 2012.

Malnutrition is widespread and famines often break out in the country, which is still reliant on foreign food aid as a result of economic mismanagement and the loss of Soviet support in the 1990s. 

But despite the suffering of his 25 million citizens, Kim continues to gorge on Swiss cheese in such vast quantities that his waistline is expanding at a dangerously rapid rate. 

Earlier this year it was revealed that Kim tried to send a team of food experts to the French city of Besancon for a crash course in dairy production.

Tired of his country's bland attempts to produce a top quality local cheese the despot ordered the three specialists to spend several months at the National Dairy Industry College.

Although the college 'politely but firmly' rejected the request, Kim remains determined to improve standards at the country's main cheese factory.

He is understood to be furious that the Pyongyang Dairy has continually failed to produce an Emmental-style cheese of a high enough quality to satisfy his demands.
