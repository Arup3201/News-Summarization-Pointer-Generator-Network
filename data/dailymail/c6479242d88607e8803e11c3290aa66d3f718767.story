Restrained: Anthony Wells, 31, was given a restraining order and also sectioned at Basildon Crown Court today

A Twitter troll who sent hundreds of abusive messages to Countdown star Rachel Riley has been given a restraining order.

Anthony Wells, 31, 'distressed' the 28-year-old presenter by sending her more than 500 messages over social media - some of which included threats on her life.

In one tweet he wrote: Please someone execute this fiend of nature.'

Wells posted a link to a blog where he wrote songs about the TV presenter.

One, entitled God Left Her Alone (A Ode To The Dead Girl Rachel), read: ‘I hope you die forever, I hope you cry forever, I hope you die now.

‘I hope your eyes bleed and your skin dries and your dream dies. I hope you fall to the earth like a child lost at birth... Dedicated to Rachel Annabelle Riley.’

He also called her a ‘dirty b****’ and described her as the ‘worst piece of s*** that ever lived in this horrid little earth’.

The trolling began after Miss Riley married Jamie Gilbert, her university sweetheart, in August 2012. The couple split 16 months later.

Wells, from Chelmsford, Essex, also targeted Coldplay singer Chris Martin and said that he would shoot his children in a sustained seven-month campaign.

Yesterday he was given a five-year restraining order at Basildon Crown Court after admitting a charge of harassment against Miss Riley, while the charge relating to Mr Martin was not pursued.

The charge stated that tweets sent from Wells’s Twitter account had 'caused Rachel Riley to fear that violence would be used against her'.

One incoherent tweet posted by Wells - whom the court heard has mental health issues - read: 'Helping them might be Rachel and Chris Martin yet again trying to steal the rest of my songs for EMI and Sony. Kill them now'.

Jamie Sawyer, prosecuting, told the court: 'Ultimately this case revolves around harassment causing fear of violence by Mr Wells between October 2012 and May 2013.

'Effectively what he did was send a persistent series of abusive Twitter messages.

Distressed: Countdown star Rachel Riley felt threatened by the stream of more than 500 messages sent by a mentally ill man to her

'Rachel Riley is something of a celebrity, a TV presenter on Countdown, who is married with children and uses her Twitter account to communicate with fans and advertise where she will be attending.

'Around 500 tweets were sent during the time of the indictment. The nature of these messages was always abusive.

'The messages sent to Rachel Riley of course caused her distress. Her personal statement gives a graphic description of her reaction to the tweets.

'In our observation these two complainants deserve protection and reassurance'.

Judge Owen Davies QC told the court the case was a ‘delicate matter’ due to Wells's health problems.

Eleanor Scott, mitigating, told the court her client has been suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and his abusive tweets had been influenced by ‘psychotic thinking’.

She said: 'At the time Mr Wells was significantly influenced by psychotic thinking. He is still a very mentally fragile individual but has pleaded guilty to the charge and understands what he did was wrong.

'He is happy to abide by a restraining order.'

Judge Davies QC imposed a restraining order banning Wells from contacting both Rachel Riley and Chris Martin either directly or indirectly.

He also sectioned Wells under the Mental Health Act.

Sentencing him, the judge said: 'You’re currently in hospital and for the moment that is the right place for you to be. I am going to make a Section 37 hospital order under the Mental Health Act.

Also targeted: Wells sent messages to Coldplay member Christ Martin as well

'That is an order requiring you to remain in hospital until authorities require otherwise'.

Punam Malhan, CPS East of England senior district prosecutor said: 'When Anthony Wells admitted harassing Rachel Riley at an earlier hearing we asked for an adjournment so we could seek the views of the other victim in this case, Chris Martin, on continuing with the charge which involved him.

'Mr Martin indicated that a plea to the charge involving Miss Riley would be acceptable to ensure that Mr Wells gets the medical help he needs and that he was content for us to not to proceed in relation to the remaining charge.

'Taking Mr Martin’s view into account we decided it was no longer in the public interest to continue with the second charge of harassment and that charge was today left on file.

'Wells has been sentenced to a hospital order under Section 37 of the Mental Health Act and a restraining order was imposed for a period of five years with a prohibition not to contact Rachel Riley or Chris Martin.

'Everyone should be able to go about their daily lives free from harassment caused by someone deliberately making offensive, violent messages about them on social media.

'We take allegations of this kind very seriously and especially where there is evidence of a course of conduct which causes fear or distress to someone, regardless of whether a victim is in the public eye or not'.
