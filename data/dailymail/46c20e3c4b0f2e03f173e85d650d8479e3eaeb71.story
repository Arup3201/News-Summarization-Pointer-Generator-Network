A dog owner has been forced to change the names of his pets Itler and Iva because they 'make people think of Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun'.

The man, from eastern France, gave in to the mayor's demand that the names be altered.

The owner of the American Staffordshire Terriers have been renamed Ilisa and Isio 4.

In September last year, Luc Binsinger, the mayor of Saint-Nicolas-de-Port, in the commune of Meurthe-et-Moselle, had refused to sign a license for the dogs because of the controversial nature of their names.

At the time, he had said: 'It's completely mad. Stupid even.'

He added: 'I don't want to sign this licence. Of course 'Itler' and 'Iva' make you think of Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun, a dubious play on words.' 

The owner had already secured an initial licence, which is required in France for dangerous dogs, but the names had not raised any concerns at the time.

Mr Binsinger said: 'It's not a question of how dangerous the dogs are, it's a question of principle.

'I have written to the local prefect to ask him what I can do. In the meantime, I'm not signing,' he told AFP.

He added that he believed the owner of the dogs was a local National Front official.
