While his new team-mates put Wycombe to the sword in their first pre-season friendly, Chelsea's summer signing Cesc Fabregas relaxed on the beach.

The former Arsenal man took time out with his family ahead of linking up with his new club for pre-season training.

Fabregas was with partner Daniella Semaan and their one-year-old daughter Lia in Sardinia with the trio lounging on the beach and frolicking in the sea.
