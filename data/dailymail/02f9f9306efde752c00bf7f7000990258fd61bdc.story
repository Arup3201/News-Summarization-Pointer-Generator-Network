New York doesn't need Fashion Week to make it fabulous. This buzzing 24-hour city is already one of the world's must-see destinations thanks to its intoxicating mix of food, booze, fitness, culture and style.

And visitors to the Big Apple don't need to be fashion editors to live the Devil Wears Prada dream.

In the city that never sleeps the opportunities to people watch, celebrity stalk, and pose like a demon are epic.

From drinking cocktails in Kate & Wills' favourite Madison Avenue bar, to Instagramming your Matcha Glo in Bryant Park or touching your toes with Tara Stiles in Soho, there's something for every level of poser.

It's not easy to out strut a New Yorker, but writer TONI JONES gave it a go on a whistle stop weekend break. 

As the world's fashion elite descend on Manhattan this week she picks her favourite places to detox, retox and strike a pose NYFW style…

NINE PLACES TO STRIKE A POSE NYFW STYLE 

1. CROSBY STREET HOTEL, Soho

A slice of boho British style in Soho, this hotel is the place to see and be seen for those in the music and fashion industries. 

Expect media couples, stylish Soho shoppers and generally gorgeous people boozing and brunching (we bumped into Jessie J and her entourage at check in).

Aside from the scene-y clientele, who like to hang in the hotel's cosy drawing room (complete with honesty bar) and pretty courtyard, the location can't be beaten for anyone keen on urban exploring and the restaurant offers a rather fabulous Ruinart champagne Afternoon Tea (£30).

The hotel rooms all feature floor-to-ceiling warehouse style windows for breathtaking Manhattan moments

Tea for two: The hotel restaurant offers a rather fabulous Ruinart champagne Afternoon Tea (£30)

Upstairs the rooms all feature floor-to-ceiling warehouse style windows for breathtaking Manhattan moments as the sun comes up over Canal Street (#blessed), and the Kit Kemp interiors are eclectic and fun featuring lots of mirrors, his and hers wardrobes, supersized toiletries, too many Frette towels and mini bars filled with fresh coconut juice and matcha tea chocolate bars.

Prices start at £500 per night.

2. BEMELMANS BAR at THE CARLYLE, A ROSEWOOD HOTEL, Upper East Side

Uptown, surrounded by tiny dogs and huge blow dries, The Carlyle, a Rosewood Hotel on Madison Avenue is a bastion of New York fashion. 

The elegant art deco hotel was once a home away from home for JFK and his wife Jackie, O.

Princess Diana was a fan, and recently the Duke & Duchess of Cambridge chose to stay in one of the £10,000 a night suites during a charity visit.

The stunning art-deco check-in desk, left, and the old-fashioned Bemelmans Bar, right, which is where you will want to spend your time.

The grand NYC dame might be fraying a bit around the edges, but she is still the go-to place for the rich and powerful style set.

The sunlit bedrooms are tastefully decked out in creams and Kiehls, mirrored doors and walk-in wardrobes are the perfect backdrop for Outfits Of The Day snaps, and if you're lucky/VIP enough you might get a terrace or at least a view over the city.

But it's downstairs, at the beautifully old-fashioned Bemelmans Bar where you will want to spend your time. 

We nursed a $23 Whisky Smash while feeling like a million dollars as we listened to live jazz (tip: there's no cover charge if you get there before 9.30pm, after that it's $25 pp).

3. STRALA YOGA, Soho

The place to go to - quite literally - strike a pose. 

Founder (and ex-model) Tara Stiles has been dubbed the coolest yoga instructor ever by Vanity Fair, penned best-selling book Slim Calm Sexy Yoga, and even has a workout to ease champagne hangovers, it doesn't get more fashion than that.

4. THE WYTHE, Brooklyn

The very hip Wythe Hotel hosts many of the best NYFW parties, but once the show has rolled onto London and beyond there are still plenty of reasons to make a beeline for this Brooklyn hotspot.

These include: Reynards for brunch (the ground floor restaurant has a whole Daytime Drinking menu and we spotted Charlotte Gainsbourg dining there looking fabulously French), the Ides Bar for sundowners (opens at 2pm, no reservations, get there early) and the rooftop terrace for breathtaking views of the Manhattan skyline.

5. SOUL CYCLE, three locations including Tribeca, Noho and Union Square

The bad news is that you're going to have to work for your posing opp at this studio. The good news is that you'll get buns of steel as a result. 

Just ask Karli Kloss and her Victoria's Secret crew who are mega fans of this cult-like spinning class which offers a special $20 (£16) rate for a first time riders.

Wheels of fury: Hard work, but a few sessions at Soul Cycle should tone up those flabby bits

6. SURF SATURDAYS, Soho

When is a coffee shop not a coffee shop? When it's a surf shack meets art gallery meets coffee shop, that's when. 

The flat whites are awesome, the denim's cool, there's a terrace for people watching, and a surf-loving barista is surely one of the best photo props there is… what's not to love?

7. CITY BAKERY, Union Square

Unlike Soul Cycle, the City Bakery does not promise buns of steel. 

It does, however, promise the 'city's best hot chocolate' and even better they serve up NY's latest baking craze – the pretzel croissant – to dunk in it. Cronut who?

8.THE LUDLOW BAR, Lower East Side

After Brooklyn, the next most hipster hangout area is the Lower East Side where The Ludlow manages to combine slouchy sofas and beardy crews with smiley service and excellent margaritas. Tip: wear an interesting hat if you wanted to be speedily seated (worked for me). 

9. ORGANIC AVENUE, Bryant Park

Juice shops are almost as prevalent as Starbucks in Manhattan now and you're nobody at Fashion Week until you have Instagrammed a picture of your shoes and a Matcha Chia Glo next to the Bryant Park tents.
