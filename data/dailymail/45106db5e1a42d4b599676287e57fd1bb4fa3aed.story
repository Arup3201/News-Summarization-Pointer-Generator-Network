The Swedish wife of Silicon Valley real estate tycoon Clyde Berg was back on the stand Thursday to testify about the night her husband had allegedly raped her with a golf putter after she rushed out of the courtroom the day before.

Ellena Berg, 37, stunned the San Jose court Wednesday when she refused to answer several questions about the alleged incident that took place last fall while the woman was nine months pregnant with a baby from a sperm donor.

Mrs Berg has accused her 74-year-old millionaire husband of outfitting her with a spiked dog collar and a leash, chaining her to a bed for two days and sexually assaulting her with a golf club.

Armed
with notes and smelling salts to keep herself calm, the statuesque 
blonde took the witness stand Thursday to address several issues that 
have been raised by Clyde Berg's defense, namely, how she was able to 
dial 911 with her hands restrained behind her back, and why she did not 
call for help sooner.

The 
Swedish-born Ellena, who reportedly met the twice-divorced Clyde Berg a 
decade ago while working as an au pair, said in court that after 
enduring years of physical and sexual abuse at the hands of her husband,
she has developed a habit for submissiveness, which could explain why 
she offered no resistance when Mr Berg allegedly put a gun to her head 
September 5, 2012.

'Mentally, physically, I wasn't there,' she said. 'It's a response system to fear and stress I learned very early,' the San Jose Mercury reported.

It
was also her deep-seated submissiveness and fear of challenging 
authority that kept her from trying to escape or summon help, according to Mrs Berg.

After
initially refusing to answer questions about the 911 call, on Thursday 
the woman finally offered an explanation, telling the court that she had
stashed a prepaid phone under the mattress sometime before the 
September 2012 incident because her husband was known to take away her 
possessions.

After allegedly spending 
two days chained to her bed and suffering abuse, Ellena Berg said she 
finally summoned the courage to retrieve the hidden phone because she 
feared her husband might kill her

‘I decided I had to save my [unborn] daughter,’ Ellena Berg testified.

Berg
then went on to describe how she slid off the bed, got down into a 
kneeling position on the floor and pushed her hands cuffed behind her 
back under the mattress.

Prompted
by prosecutor Alison Filo to explain how she managed to dial 911, 
Ellena Berg haltingly said that she counted the keys on the phone, which
had raised buttons rather than a flat screen.  

The woman then dropped the device and pushed the 'send' button with her tongue, she recalled.

Prior
to her testimony, Ellena Berg surprised those present in the Santa Clara County Hall of Justice by handing out copies of a letter she had written, in which she 
complained about being treated in an unfair manner by everyone involved 
in the case, even her own lawyer.

Later
that day, Allen Ruby, Clyde Berg's attorney, got a chance to 
cross-examine Mrs Berg, questioning her claim that her notoriously 
tight-fisted husband, who once berated her for spending $15 at a car 
wash, has agreed to a postnuptial contract, which called for the real 
estate mogul to pay Ellena $2million in case of a divorce.

Ruby
also cast doubt on Mrs Berg’s assertion that as part of the deal, 
her husband has agreed to pay all the expenses incurred by her sperm 
donor, a renowned California ballroom dancer.  

Details
of the alleged horrific incident emerged in court this week during 
74-year-old Clyde Berg's preliminary hearing on charges of corporal 
injury of a spouse and sexual penetration by force.

His
third wife was found bloodied and bound in the couple's San Jose home 
last year when she was nine-months pregnant and told police her elderly 
husband outfitted her with the leash and chained her to the bed while 
sexually assaulting her with the golf club.

She took the stand Wednesday at Santa Clara County Hall of Justice to present her version of events to a judge who must now decide if there is enough evidence to hold Berg over for trial.

The real estate magnate - who is worth $200million - vehemently denies the charges and claims he's the victim of a scam to get around a restrictive prenuptial agreement.

During her Wednesday testimony, Ellena stunned the court by refusing to answer to key questions - one about a night in 2010 when she was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and how her two previous pregnancies ended.

The San Jose Mercury News reported that when the 37-year-old said, 'I refuse to answer that', in response to one of the questions, the judge's eyes widened.

She then abruptly left the courtroom, leading the judge to suggest that Ellena might be 'disturbed' and 'paranoid.'  

The Swedish native has claimed in a 43-page civil suit that the incident capped off ten years of physical and sexual abuse at the hands of her husband.

The divorce papers state that Clyde Berg wielded his considerable power against her like 'a weapon of mass destruction' and claim she lived in virtual isolation 'as a slave' in fear of his unpredictable physical and sexual abuse.

She said he made her drink out of a dog's water bowl and dunked her head in the toilet after she vomited from morning sickness.

There have already been doubts raised about her account of what happened on the night of September 4 after gynecological reports that arguably show Ellena Berg did not sustain the degree of sexual abuse she claims and questions were raised as to how she was able to call 911 while her hands were cuffed behind her back.

Clyde Berg is the brother and business partner of billionaire Carl Berg, one of the richest people in the United States.

Ellena Berg has also obtained a restraining order against Clyde Berg and has custody of Rudy, the couple's beloved Weimaraner, whom she claimed was also abused by her estranged husband.
