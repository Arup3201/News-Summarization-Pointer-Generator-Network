The family of a missing New Jersey student last seen hiking outside Jerusalem called on the Israeli Defense Force to join the search on Monday, amid fears he could have been the victim of ongoing tensions with Palestinians.

Aaron Sofer, 23, failed to return home on Friday after becoming separated from a friend on a wooded slope in the Jerusalem Forest, near to where a Palestinian boy was found burned last month in a revenge attack for the murder of three Israeli students in June.

His parents, who have flown to Israel, believe he could have been the victim of a reprisal attack and have openly questioned authorities attempts to locate their son, especially in light of the current Gaza-Israeli conflict.

Disappeared: Twenty-three-year-old yeshiva student Aaron Sofer has been missing since Friday when he went on a hike with a friend in the Jerusalem Forest

'A physically, mentally and emotionally healthy young man does not go missing for 72 hours,' Dov Hirth, a spokesman for the family told the Jerusalem Post on Monday.

'The family is not satisfied with the way the search and rescue operation has been handled thus far.'

Hundreds of officers and volunteers joined the search for Sofer since the alarm was first raised on Friday after he split from his friend while they were climbing in the Beit Zayit area of the Jerusalem Woods.

'The fact of the matter is we have a young man missing for no apparent reason, and it was on page 1 of all the newspapers and then the coverage just stopped,' said Hirth to the Jerusalem Post. 'This needs to continue to be a major story.'

Last month, three Israeli's were indicted for the sickening murder of Muhammad Abu Khdeir, 16, whose burnt body was found near to where Sofer disappeared.

'This area is bordered by Jewish communities and by Arab communities, so it is very concerning,' said Meir Lichtenstein who is a member of the Lakewood Council in New Jersey, the Sofer's home town.

Indeed, concern is rising amongst the Jewish community back in the United States.

'It’s scary to think what possibly could be the ramifications,' said neighbor Tzvi Meth to CBS Local.

'Great fear is that he was accosted; he was taken away, kidnapped.'
