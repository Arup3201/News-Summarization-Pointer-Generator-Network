A woman accused of abducting her newborn nephew in Wisconsin and abandoning him outside a gas station in Iowa has pleaded not guilty to a federal kidnapping charge.

Prosecutors say Kristen Smith, 31, of Aurora, Colorado, kidnapped four-day-old Kayden Powell from the Town of Beloit home where the boy's parents were staying earlier this month.

Police arrested her at an Iowa gas station hours later and discovered the baby in a crate outside another nearby gas station the next morning. The child was alive and well despite being left in frigid temperatures for more than 24 hours.

A federal grand jury indicted Smith on a kidnapping count last week. She pleaded not guilty to the charge on Wednesday.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephen Crocker scheduled her trial to begin on June 23.

Accused: Kriten Rpse Smith allegedly took her sister's newborn son and dumped him in a gas station trash can

Prosecutors say Kristen Smith was found with baby clothes and prosthetic pregnancy belly in her car - and had pretended to be pregnant.

Smith was arrested when police stopped her at a gas station 170 miles away in West Branch, Iowa, apparently driving back to her home in Colorado.

Some 29 hours later a police chief discovered newborn Kayden, crying and wrapped in blankets in a nearby plastic storage bin.

He was alive and well despite having been left in freezing temperatures.

The 911 call reveals Brianna sprung to her half-sister's defense when the operator suggested she could be a suspect - despite Brianna waking up and finding Smith and the baby gone.

'My son is missing,' she told the operator through tears. 'He's like four days old... I put him to sleep in his crib and now he’s not there.'

A friend or relative of Brianna then took the phone and told the operator: 'Her sister was here earlier. Her sister’s gone and the baby’s gone.'

Brianna took the phone back and added: 'I called her, and she's bawling her eyes out and told me to call the cops.'

The dispatcher replied: 'But she's claiming she doesn't have the kid, correct?'

A tearful Brianna said: 'No, she wouldn’t take my son!'

Authorities
 released the nine-minute recording after Smith was charged with 
kidnapping. She was originally held on an unrelated fraud warrant.

The
 FBI alleges Smith took the boy from her half-sister's home in southern 
Wisconsin before 4.30am on Thursday, five days after Kayden was born, 
and began driving to Colorado.

After
 Marshall discovered the baby was missing and called police, an officer 
reached Smith on her phone while she was passing through Iowa and 
instructed her to stop for questioning.

An officer who met Smith at a gas station in West Branch, Iowa, found no sign of Kayden.

Discovery: Kayden was found wrapped in blankets and placed in a bag at this Iowa gas station

Search: The missing baby was the subject of a state-wide search

Fears: Brianna and Bruce had feared for their son's safety after waking to find he was missing

Smith
 repeatedly denied any connection to the disappearance, but she was 
taken into custody on a warrant from Texas charging her with tampering 
with government records and fraud.

About 29 hours later, the police chief found Kayden, who was reunited with his parents at an Iowa hospital.

Investigators
 said they found online communications in which Smith falsely claimed to
 be pregnant or have given birth and a prosthetic pregnancy belly in her
 car.

When Mike Horihan, the chief of police
 in West Branch, Iowa, set out to search for a kidnapped newborn baby, he prepared himself for the worst, considering that the 
temperature had dipped to record-breaking 11 below zero in the region 
that week.

Horihan, who 
heads the town's three-person police department, got dressed in his 
winter gear and began searching for six-day-old Kayden Powell, who was 
allegedly snatched by his aunt Thursday from his home in Beloit, 
Wisconsin, as his mother slept.

Scene: Baby Kayden was snatched from his crib at this Wisconsin home in the early hours of February 6

Police
 pulled over Kristen Smith, the baby's aunt, in West Branch just hours 
after the baby’s disappearance, but the woman did not have the newborn 
with her.

‘Realistically, we thought the baby could have been anywhere between Wisconsin and here,’ Horihan told The Washington Post.

The small-town police chief's job was to scour a stretch of road on the north side on Interstate 80.

As
 luck would have it, the former Iowa State Patrol officer’s first stop 
was a BP gas station. After questioning the owner, he went around the 
back and spotted a stack of recycling bins.

Nearby,
 he noticed a plastic tote with the lid covered in frost. Horihan 
opened the container, only to discover a black blanket inside.

The
 unexpected find set off alarm bells in the police chief's head. Given 
the frigid temperatures the night before, Horihan was certain that he 
located the missing baby too late.

‘I was opening that container like I was trying to preserve evidence,’ he said.

All
 of a sudden, Horihan heard what he described as a clearly audible 
whimper coming from what he realized was a bundle of blankets stuffed 
inside the plastic tote.

When the police chief finally peeked inside the container, he found little Kayden alive.

‘I got a baby crying here! Baby crying here!’ Horihan yelled to his partner. ‘I found the baby!’

Smith faces active warrants relating to 
fraud, false representation and document tampering in unrelated cases in
 at least three states. In Texas, she has been charged as Smith. But in 
Indiana and Wisconsin, she is charged under the name Pearson.
