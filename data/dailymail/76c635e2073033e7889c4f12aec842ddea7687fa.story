New evidence showing the level of atmospheric CO2 millions of years ago supports recent climate change predictions from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), according to research scientists.

A multinational research team, led by scientists at the University of Southampton, has analysed new records showing the CO2 content of Earth's atmosphere between 2.3 to 3.3 million years ago, during the Pliocene era.

And this data could be used to work out how Earth today will react as the climate continues to warm due to human activities.

Research led by the University of Southampton looked at the history of Earth's climate 2.3 to 3.3 million years ago in the Pilocene era. They say this data confirms the IPCC's warnings about our modern climate (stock image shown) if CO2 levels are allowed to continue to rise

During the Pliocene, the Earth was around 2°C warmer than it is today and atmospheric CO2 levels were around 350-400 parts per million (ppm), similar to the levels reached in recent years.

By studying the relationship between CO2 levels and climate change during a warmer period in Earth's history, the scientists have been able to estimate how the climate will respond to increasing levels of carbon dioxide, a parameter known as climate sensitivity.

The Pliocene is particularly useful as it is the last time CO2 levels on Earth were as high as they are today, Dr Gavin Foster, co-author of the study, told MailOnline.

Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes.

It will increase the likelihood of 'severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems.'

This includes extreme weather and rising sea levels, heat waves, flooding and droughts.

Ocean acidification, which comes from the added carbon absorbed by oceans, will harm marine life.

Without changes in emissions, 'climate change risks are likely to be high or very high by the end of the 21st century.'

At the current rate, by mid-century temperatures will increase by about another 2°C (3.6°F) compared to temperatures from 1986 to 2005.

By the end of the century, that scenario will bring temperatures that are about 3.7°C (6.7°F) warmer.

The impact on the Earth could already be considered dangerous, the report claims. 

He said the Arctic ‘wasn’t a tropical paradise, but it certainly had animals and trees, it was a lot warmer back then.’

The geological record provides a rich archive that we can dip in to, to see the effects on our planet as the climate continues to warm.

As the planet warms even further at a rapid rate that cannot be attributed to natural processes alone, it will be necessary to go further and further back in time in the geological record.

For example, 50 million years ago it was 12°C warmer than it is today, when there were crocodiles in the Arctic and sub-tropical forests on Antarctica. 

The findings, which have been published in Nature, also show how climate sensitivity can vary over the long term.

Dr Foster added in a release: 'Today the Earth is still adjusting to the recent rapid rise of CO2 caused by human activities, whereas the longer-term Pliocene records document the full response of CO2-related warming.

'Our estimates of climate sensitivity lie well within the range of 1.5 to 4.5°C increase per CO2 doubling summarised in the latest IPCC report.

'This suggests that the research community has a sound understanding of what the climate will be like as we move toward a Pliocene-like warmer future caused by human greenhouse gas emissions.'

CO2 levels in the Pliocene - when animals like the sabre-tooth cat Dinofelis (illustrated) roamed - were similar to the levels now reached. At that time the Arctic was warm enough to have animals and trees. And as the climate warms further due to human activity, scientists will look even further back in the geological record

The Pliocene is particularly useful as it is the last time CO2 levels on Earth were as high as they are today, now due to man-made emissions (stock image shown), Dr Gavin Foster told MailOnline

Lead author of the study, Dr Miguel Martinez-Boti, also from Southampton said: 'Our new records also reveal an important change at around 2.8 million years ago, when levels rapidly dropped to values of about 280ppm, similar to those seen before the Industrial Revolution.

'This caused a dramatic global cooling that initiated the ice-age cycles that have dominated Earth's climate ever since.'

The research team also assessed whether climate sensitivity was different in warmer times, like the Pliocene, than in colder times, like the glacial cycles of the last 800,000 years.

Dr Eelco Rohling, of the Australian National University in Canberra, said: 'We find that climate change in response to CO2 change in the warmer period was around half that of the colder period.

'We determine that this difference is driven by the growth and retreat of large continental ice sheets that are present in the cold ice-age climates; these ice sheets reflect a lot of sunlight and their growth consequently amplifies the impact of CO2 changes.'

Dr Richard Pancost, from the University of Bristol Cabot Institute, added: 'When we account for the influence of the ice sheets, we confirm that the Earth's climate changed with a similar sensitivity to overall [radiative] forcing during both warmer and colder climates.'

According to last year's IPCC report, continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes (some shown on the map). It will increase the likelihood of 'severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems,' said the report
