What a mess.

Billions of gallons of human waste have poured into New York Harbor since Hurricane Sandy hit the region, NBC reports.

The waste is coming from the fifth largest sewage treatment plant in the nation, based in Newark, New Jersey.

What a waste: More than three billion gallons of untreated or partially treated wastewater have poured into the New York Harbor since October 29

No fishing: Fishing, crabbing and shellfishing bans in the New Jersey waters of the harbor are in effect

A 12-ft surge of water flooded the plant that serves some three million people when Sandy struck on October 29.

The Passaic Valley Sewerage Commission plant has pumped more than three billion gallons of untreated or partially treated wastewater into local waterways since then.

Mike DeFrancisci, executive director of the plant, could not say when the mess would stop.

He simply replied ‘as soon as possible’ when asked at a briefing when repairs to the facility would be made, according to the Star-Ledger. DeFrancisci also said it was ‘a little too early’ to estimate the cost of damages.

Gross point: The polluted waters surround the Statue of Liberty

Until repairs are made, the plant will continue to dump millions of gallons of partially treated human waste into waters near the Statue of Liberty every day.

The pathogens in partially treated waste are a health hazard and a threat to safety.

Larry Ragonese, a New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection spokesman, said fishing, crabbing and shellfishing bans in the New Jersey waters of the harbor will remain in effect for the time being.

The New York City Department of Environmental Protection issued a warning to residents to avoid contact with the water.
