A Queensland MP and former neighbour of Gerard and Allison Baden-Clay has told a Brisbane murder trial how  one of two female screams he heard on the last night Mrs Baden-Clay was seen alive sounded like a woman losing consciousness.

Dr Bruce Flegg, a registered medical practitioner and the member for the western Brisbane state electorate of Moggill, said on Tuesday he had been in his home a few streets away from the Baden-Clay's Brookfield house when he heard the cries.

'It was a single reverse crescendo in volume, tapering off, and what I would describe as having an involuntary quality,' he told the Brisbane Supreme Court.

Two short screams and a woman losing consciousness: Liberal National Party Queensland MP Dr Bruce Flegg (pictured leaving the Brisbane Supreme Court) told the jury on day nine of the Baden-Clay murder trial how on the last night Allison Baden-Clay was seen alive he heard two female screams, the first of which sounded like a woman in a partial state of lost consciousness

Last seen alive: Allison Baden-Clay (pictured) was last seen alive on the night of April 19, 2012, when the 43-year-old mother of three young girls was living a few streets away from Queensland politician, Dr Bruce Flegg, who told the Brisbane Supreme Court he heard two short female screams from his house that evening

Lending friends: Stuart Christ (above, left) and Robert Cheesman (right) both high school friends of the accused have told his Brisbane Supreme Court murder trial how they each loaned him $90,000 to prop up his ailing real estate business, but apart from a few interest payments the loans had not been repaid

'The tone ... was very strongly suggestive of a reduced level of consciousness,' Dr Flegg said.

'I remember it very clearly because it was distressing and I'm not one to be distressed by what I hear.'

Dr Flegg said after he heard the first scream he had gone out to the front of the house to investigate and then checked with someone staying at his house whether they also heard the sound, but they hadn't.

A few minutes later he said heard a similar scream.

Allison Baden-Clay, 43, was reported missing by her husband on April 20, 2012. Her body was found 10 days later on a creek bank on Kholo Creek in Anstead, in Brisbane's west.

Dr Flegg was the 59th witness in murder trial of Gerard Baden-Clay, who has pleaded not guilty to killing Allison Baden Clay in April 2012. The trial is in its third week.

The Liberal National Party backbencher said he knew Baden-Clay socially through the Kenmore Chamber of Commerce, which operated in a neighbouring suburb and of whichÂ  Baden-Clay was the president.

He said Baden-Clay asked him for a $400,000 loan in December 2011 saying he owed money to business partners and wanted to keep control of his real estate business.Dr Flegg said Baden-Clay phoned him again in March 2012 and Dr Flegg asked a woman called Sue Heath to return the call because he was busy electioneering.

In evidence during his trial, which is now in its third week, the accused Gerard Baden-Clay (pictured, left) said a marriage counsellor had advised he and his wife to spend 15 minutes a day letting Allison (right) 'vent' after she discovered he was having an affair

Ms Heath has already testified that Baden-Clay asked for a loan of about $300,000 during the conversation.Several days later, Baden-Clay called Dr Flegg again.'I think Gerard had the understanding Sue had conveyed me the intent of the call and it wasn't going anywhere,' he said.

Friends of Gerard Baden-Clay's also gave evidence about loans to the former prestige real estate agent.

Meanwhile, two high school friends of Baden-Clay told the trial they lent him large sums of money to prop up his ailing real estate business in early 2011.Stuart Christ and Robert Cheesman told the trial they lent him $90,000 each after he asked them and a third friend for help.Mr Christ said during a February 2011 meeting with Baden-Clay the group of four discussed that his Brisbane real estate business had expanded 'massively' but Brisbane floods in January 2011 had affected sales and halted cash flow.

The trial has heard that by 2009 Gerard Baden-Clay and his wife Allison (pictured on their 23 August, 1997 wedding day) were 'living under the same roof, but living separate lives' and that the mother-of-three had told a psychologist she and her husband had 'minimal contact' and had not been sexually intimate since 2007

'Without a further cash injection the business would have been in severe trouble,' Mr Christ said.'Simply there was no cash in the bank to pay the bills.'Mr Christ and Mr Cheesman told the court that after looking closely at the business's books they agreed to lend their friend $90,000 each on the understanding he'd pay it back with 10 per cent interest.Both said Baden-Clay made about three interest repayments on the loans but the repayments stopped around mid-2012.In April 2012, when Allison Baden-Clay died, no part of the two $90,000 loans had been repaid.Under cross examination Mr Cheesman said Baden-Clay had a number of assets in his own name, including shares, and was personally financially secure.Mr Cheesman agreed with defence barrister Michael Byrne that if the business had failed Baden-Clay could 'walk away from it'.

Two expert witnesses gave evidence to the trial about Ms Baden-Clay's body, which was found on a mud bank at Kholo Creek on April 30, 2012.Retired university professor Jacob John, an expert on microscopic algae, said he examined a piece of bone, some bone marrow and some liver tissue from Mrs Baden-Clay's body.Dr John told the court microscopic algae called diatoms are present in all bodies of water and if someone drowns, diatoms are inevitably found in parts such as the liver, kidney and bone marrow.He said a water sample from the Kholo Creek near where Mrs Baden-Clay's body was found showed there was a diatom 'bloom' in the water but he could not find any in the samples he was given.'The subject concerned did not drown in Kholo Creek or anywhere,' Dr John concluded. 'There was no evidence of drowning at all.'Earlier, a forensic entomologist estimated the mother-of-three had been dead for between three and 11 days before she was found.Professor James Wallman said he examined fly and maggot specimens taken from Mrs Baden-Clay's remains.Based on their size and age he estimated they must have present for three to four days, if the air temperature was high.If the temperature was cooler the insects could have been on Mrs Baden-Clay's body longer, he said.He agreed with Crown prosecutor Danny Boyle the insect evidence was consistent with Mrs Baden-Clay being dead 11 days.
