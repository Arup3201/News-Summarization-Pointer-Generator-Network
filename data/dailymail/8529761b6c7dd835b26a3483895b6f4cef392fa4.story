A man with autism that has rendered him almost mute is about to release an album after he was found to have perfect pitch and an amazing singing voice.

Kyle Coleman, 25, from Gwithian, Cornwall, was diagnosed with autism at the age of three and has only ever been able to say a few words.

However, his talent was discovered after his mother Caroline took him to a music therapy session in 2009.

Hidden talent: Kyle, who is autistic, has a pitch perfect singing voice

Since then music therapist Carine Kelley has been visiting him at home 
twice a week and has found that music is an instinctive way for him to 
express his emotions.

'It became clear almost immediately that Kyle had a natural affinity 
with musical elements and could recreate his favourite songs on the 
keyboard with no prior musical knowledge,' she said.

'It is when he sings though that his songs come to life. His personality and emotion shine through in his singing and this has 
made it possible for us to develop a special relationship and for Kyle’s
 abilities and confidence to soar.'

After realising her son had a gift, Ms Coelman took him to Plymouth to see how he would do in a recording studio.

Kyle has recovered an album that will give all profits to various autism charities

Unfazed by the new experience Kyle recorded his favourite song, Monday, Monday by the Mamas and Papas.

The owner of the studio was so impressed by Kyle’s ability he suggested they consider recording a charity album.

Now, 18 months later, Kyle is preparing to make his debut.

His mother said: 'There has never been an album recorded and released by an 
autistic individual who has very limited language and an inability to 
communicate other than just a few words.

'His dad was a musician and he died suddenly two years ago in a motorcycle accident. I think his music ability is from his dad’s side.'

Kyle's mother said his personality shone through his songs

Kyle has recorded nine covers - including songs by Robbie Williams, Cat 
Stevens and Razorlight - plus one that was written especially for him about autism. The album is being supported by the National Autistic Society (NAS) and will be released to coincide with World Autism Day.

The album, Kyle, Therefore I Am, will be available on Amazon and iTunes on April 2 and any money raised will go to NAS and other charities.

The CD can also be bought directly from the website www.kylecoleman.co.uk
