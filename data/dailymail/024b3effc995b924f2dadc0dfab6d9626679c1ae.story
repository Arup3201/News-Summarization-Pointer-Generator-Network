Arsene Wenger confirmed Olivier Giroud could be facing a long spell out injured but refused to confirm the striker had broken his foot until he has seen another specialist on Wednesday.

The Arsenal boss was determined to focus on Wednesday night’s Champions League play-off against Besiktas.

The first-leg was goalless in Istanbul and Giroud’s absence from the second leg at the Emirates will hit Wenger, who is already without captain Mikel Arteta, injured, and Aaron Ramsey, suspended after his red card in Istanbul.

'He will not play,' said Wenger, when asked about Giroud’s injury. 

'For the rest, he will see a specialist in England tomorrow (Wednesday) and after we will make an announcement of how long he will be out. 

'We prepare for the game. It can be a long-term injury. We will see tomorrow (Wednesday). I don’t know if it’s broken. It’s sad for us but we are focused on the game.

'It has happened to 99% of the big clubs in Europe. We are highly determined. The task is clear and we know we can do it. So let’s do it.'

When quizzed on whether Giroud's injury would force Arsenal into the transfer market, Wenger refused to say anything 'categorically'.

He added: 'We are 24 hours in front of a big game and our focus is more on that than transfers.

'I learned one thing in this job, you say nothing categorically.

'It’s a very important game. We want to play on the top level. It’s more important on the sporting side than the financial side.
