A former Republican campaign intern - who worked for the likes of Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan and Newt Gingrich - has been accused of orchestrating a massive sextortion scheme.

Adam Savader, 21, of Great Neck, New York, allegedly threatened to splash nude photos of 15 young women all over the internet if they refused to send additional racy photos to him.

Savader has been charged with cyberstalking and extortion through the internet.

Federal investigators say that he knew each of his 15 victims, either from high school or college.

Authorities say Savader, who worked as a vice presidential operations intern during Romney's 2012 bid for the White House, obtained the photos through hacked accounts that belonged to the women.

Many of the women are college students who knew Savader from high school.

The victims live in Michigan; Long Island, New York; and Washington, D.C.

According to a criminal complaint filed in Michigan, a woman listed as 'Victim 1' called police to report that she had received text messages from a person who said his name was 'John Smith.'

He claimed that he had nude photos of her and that he would send them to her family if she didn't send more.

He then sent her a link to a Photobucket.com account, where she was stunned to find a a photo of herself intended for a former boyfriend, but never posted on the internet.

It is alleged that Savader obtained the photos by hacking into her AOL email account and taking stealing the photos.

The affidavit says that in another text, 'John Smith' asked her a series of personal questions about her sexual preference and preferred sexual positions.

He also informed her that he was masturbating to her photos.

In other cases, Savader allegedly threatened his victims, telling one: 'I swear to god don't be stupid. You don't want every1 (sic) including your parents seeing your t*** a** and p****.'

Savader is now in custody after appearing in New York federal court on Tuesday.

He appears with numerous politicians in photos posted to his Facebook account, including Newt Gingrich (whom he also worked for), Rep Michelle Bachmann and Sen Al Franken.

His attorney, Michael Shoshnick, told the New York Daily News: 'I've known Adam his entire life and he has never behaved in a way that would lead me to believe these allegations are true.'

The criminal complaint says Savader sent text messages over a Google phone service and identified himself as John Smith.
