A cat lover rescued four kittens who were dumped in a bag in the middle of a busy Birmingham road.

Caroline Alexander, who runs King’s Heath Cat Club, discovered the kittens outside her home in Bank Street around midnight after hearing a car pulling up and screeching off.

The animals were seriously dehydrated, underweight and infested with fleas so Ms Alexander, 33, delivered them to safety at Cramar Cat Rescue and Sanctuary in Hopwood.

She said: ‘I found the kittens just left on the pavement. They could barely breathe they were so dehydrated and they couldn’t walk. If they were left any longer they would have died. Now we’re concerned where the mother might be.’

The five-week old kittens were taken to the vets and given fluids for dehydration and flea treatment.Rachael, a supervisor from Cramar Cat Rescue, said she had never seen animals in such a distressing condition.

The kittens were soon re-homed after being rescued by cat lover Caroline Alexander

She said: ‘I’ve worked at Cramar for eight years and I’ve never seen this many fleas on a cat, let alone small kittens.

‘We rushed them straight to our vets as they were very small and weak.

‘They were so dehydrated they would have died in this heat.’

The kittens, renamed Dime, Dollar, Penny and Tuppence, have now been rehomed.

Rachael said: ‘These kittens are very friendly so it wasn’t hard finding a home for them.’
