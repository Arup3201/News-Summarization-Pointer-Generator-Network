Six Victoria Crosses (VC) awarded to members of the Lancashire Fusiliers for their bravery at Gallipoli during World War One are set to be displayed together for the first time next year to commemorate 100 years since the famous victory.

On the morning of April 25, 1915, one of the most courageous actions ever performed by the British armed forces took place at a beach close to Cape Helles on the Gallipoli Peninsula in Turkey.

Collectively the six medals became known as the ‘six VCs before breakfast’ after they were awarded in recognition of the gallantry and bravery shown by the men of the 1st Battalion while many in Britain were still asleep.

Five of the VC meddles, including that awarded to Pte William Keneally, left, were relatively straight-forward to find but the sixth - belonging to Major Cuthbert Bromley, right - required a nationwide search by the Fusilier Museum in Bury

The Fusilier Museum in Bury hopes the collection of medals will form the centrepiece of an exhibition to be staged next April to mark the centenary of the Gallipoli landings.

‘It has never happened before. It will be the first time in 100 years that all six Victoria Crosses will be together,’ Sarah Stevenson, collections officer at the museum, told This Is Lancashire.

While the museum already owns two of the VCs and has secured the loan of three others from Lord Ashcroft, the sixth medal required a nationwide search.

Earlier this year the museum announced that it was desperate to find the VC awarded to Major Cuthbert Bromley, from Seaford in East Sussex, who had been temporarily promoted from captain and was wounded in the landing.

The last record the museum had of the VC was when it had been put up for auction in the late 1980s.  

The museum carried out extensive genealogy research to trace Major Bromley’s descendants, who still own the meddle and live in Bromley, Kent. 

They will visit the museum in December to discuss proposals to loan the VC for next year's exhibition.

'We are delighted to have found the missing medal. It’s taken a lot of time and effort but we are hopeful that all six will be united as part of our centenary exhibition for Gallipoli,' Col Brian Gorski, the museum's chairman told the Telegraph.

The other five medals were awarded to Cpl John Grimshaw, Pte William Keneally, Sgt Alfred Richards, Sgt Frank Stubbs and Capt Richard Willis.

The battle of Gallipoli saw the Lancashire Fusiliers experience heavy casualties with 11 officers and 350 men either killed or wounded

The battle of Gallipoli was launched by the allied forces to secure a sea route to Russia after they asked for assistance against the Turks.

The landing at the beaches on the peninsula of Gallipoli saw the Lancashire Fusiliers experience heavy casualties with 11 officers and 350 men either killed or wounded.

Another 400 brave fusiliers were left to overwhelm enemy defences and in the presence of such heroism, the Fusiliers were allotted six VCs and ordered to choose the recipients.

The VC is the highest military decoration awarded for valour 'in the face of the enemy' to members of British, Commonwealth and Empire armed forces.

The Lancashire Fusiliers have been awarded nineteen VCs, eighteen of which were awarded in the First World War, more than any other regiment in that conflict.

Each year a Gallipoli Day march and church service is held in Bury to commemorate the soldiers’ heroism.
