A diamond worth £12,000 was shot into space this morning - and whoever finds it when it lands back on earth gets to keep it.

The sparkler was mounted to a steel frame and attached to a helium balloon. It will rise above the earth until the atmospheric pressure at the edge of space causes the balloon to pop.

The diamond will then parachute back down to earth in a giant orange parachute - and whoever finds it will be a cool £12,000 richer.

The diamond was launched just before 9am today from a field in Derbyshire and is expected to land back on earth around noon.

A tracking device has been fitted to the diamond and the firm will be tweeting clues using #diamondinthesky for gem hunters to join in the race in the search for the gem when it lands.

The potential 'drop zone', however, is estimated to cover a range of more than 60 miles - meaning it could be days before it is found unless it lands in the middle of a village, town or city.

The UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and online retailer 77 Diamonds worked together to launch the jewel into space and are tracking its path.

Chiefs at the website with the 'largest selection of natural diamonds in the world' hand-picked the diamond was for its 'brilliance and sparkle'.

The gem is a 'modified cushion brilliant cut', similar to the engagement rings of Kim Kardashian and Jessica Biel.

Bosses at 77 Diamonds, which takes its name from the first ever diamond engagement ring given by Archduke Maximilian I of Austria to Mary of Burgundy in 1477, say the stunt is to raise awareness of the firm's access to 80 per cent of the world's finest polished diamonds.

It is also aimed at promoting its so-called interactive universe, called Diamonds in the Sky, which allows users to fill a virtual night sky with thousands of stars - each one unique and named after someone special.

Tobias Kormind, co-founder of 77 Diamonds, says: 'We are very excited about the launch.

'What better way to raise awareness of our virtual universe than by actually making it a reality and putting a diamond in the sky for the first time ever.

'With Diamonds in the Sky, we wanted to explore the parallels between diamonds and stars in an imaginative and engaging way.'
