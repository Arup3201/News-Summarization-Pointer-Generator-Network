Fight: Hannah Kingsley threatened to cut the throat of a 10-year-old girl who argued with her daughter

A mother threatened to cut the throat of a 10-year-old girl who had an argument with her daughter, a court heard.

Hannah Kingsley screamed, 'Don't shout at my child' and swore at the girl while holding a knife following an ongoing neighbourhood dispute.

The 45-year-old avoided jail over the incident, but was given a 12-month community order at Teesside Crown Court.

Prosecutor Shaun Dodds said Kingsley, from Middlesbrough, intervened after the little girl had an argument with her daughter.

'She appears with a knife, shouting at the child,' he said.

'While holding the knife she shouts, "Donâ€™t ever shout at my child, if you do I will cut your throat," and various expletives.'

The court heard both sets of parents then became involved, leading to a fight in which Kingsley's partner Cornell Brown brandished a cosh.

He was given a suspended jail sentence in a separate set of proceedings.

Kingsley pleaded guilty to having a blade in a public place. The court heard she had previous convictions for dishonesty and drugs offending, but no history of violence.

Scott Taylor, defending, told the court Kingsley had moved since the incident in July last year and she had no further contact with the family.

Recorder Andrew Dallas said: 'There is obviously a background here and she appears to acknowledge the stupidity of what she did.

'Brandishing a knife in a public place in these circumstances was a foolish thing to do.

'It it had gone any further you would have been going to prison today.

'I take into account it was never your intention to cause any harm, though undoubtedly the child of your neighbour would have been frightened by the way you were behaving and the things you said were wholly inappropriate.'
