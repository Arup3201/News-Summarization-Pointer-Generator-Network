Paul Chambers, 28, pictured left with comedian Al Murray, was fined £385 and ordered to pay £600 costs at Doncaster Magistrates’ Court in May 2010 but it has been overturned

Telling jokes about blowing up an airport is not a crime, the Lord Chief Justice ruled yesterday.

In a landmark High Court ruling, Lord Judge overturned the conviction of a frustrated airline passenger who tweeted that he meant to blow up the airport.

Paul Chambers, 28, had been convicted of sending a menacing message even though he broadcast his joke in his own name and no one at Robin Hood Airport in Doncaster took it seriously.

The Crown Prosecution Service took him to court under the 2003 Communications Act, and Doncaster magistrates told him to pay £600 costs, a £385 fine and £15 victim surcharge. The conviction in May 2010 was later upheld by a Crown Court judge.

But yesterday the Lord Chief Justice said a joke could not by definition be menacing: ‘If the persons who receive and read it, or may reasonably be expected to receive it, or read it, would brush it aside as a silly joke, or a joke in bad taste... it would be a contradiction in terms to describe it as a message of a menacing character.’

The ruling was hailed as a victory for free speech and a rebuke to over-zealous police and lawyers.

Mr Chambers, from Corby, Northamptonshire, lost his job as an administration manager after he was convicted and said he had become unemployable because of the prosecution.

He sent his tweet when snow shut the airport in January 2010. It said: ‘Robin Hood Airport is closed. You’ve got a week and a bit to get your s*** together otherwise I am blowing the airport sky high!!’

He said after the ruling: ‘It’s a very big decision for people doing what human beings do – telling a joke sometimes, even if it’s a bad one.’

The judges noted there was no evidence before the Crown Court to suggest any of the followers of the 'tweet', or anyone else who may have seen it posted on Mr Chambers’ timeline, found it to be of a menacing character or, at a time when the threat of terrorism was real, even minimally alarming.

In fact, nothing was done about it by anyone until five days later when the duty manager responsible for security at the airport, while off duty at home, found it.

Frustration: Mr Chambers said he sent the tweet as he was annoyed that Robin Hood Airport in South Yorkshire was closed by snow in January 2010

Robert Smith QC, for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), had said that, on any view, Mr Chambers, of Corby, Northamptonshire, a man of previous good character who worked as an administration and finance supervisor, was 'very foolish' to do what he did.

He said the question was, by whose standards and by what members of society would such a message be viewed as a joke, given that those who had access to it would probably not have any knowledge of the circumstances which led to it being sent?

Stephen Fry welcomed the 'complete vindication and victory' for Mr Chambers following today’s ruling.

The broadcaster and comedian, who stood alongside Mr Chambers during an earlier appeal hearing, took to Twitter to congratulate him and his legal team.

The star, who is taking a break from the social networking site, wrote: 'Pops head up quickly: complete vindication and victory for Paul Chambers in twitterjoketrial. Well done DavidAllenGreen and team. Bye!'

Stephen Fry, a prominent Twitter user, tweeted at the time that he would be happy to pay Chambers' fine

Fellow comedian Al Murray, who was in court for the ruling, wrote on Twitter 'He’s won”, before adding: 'Colossal relief here in court. Short and sweet.'

In the ruling, Lord Judge said the 2003 Act, which came into force before Twitter was invented, did not create 'some newly-minted interference with the first of President Roosevelt’s essential freedoms - freedom of speech and expression.

'Satirical, or iconoclastic, or rude comment, the expression of unpopular or unfashionable opinion about serious or trivial matters, banter or humour, even if distasteful to some or painful to those subjected to it should and no doubt will continue at their customary level, quite undiminished by this legislation.

'Given the submissions by Mr Cooper, we should perhaps add that for those who have the inclination to use Twitter for the purpose, Shakespeare can be quoted unbowdlerised, and with Edgar, at the end of King Lear, they are free to speak not what they ought to say, but what they feel.'

'The more one reflected on it,' he added, 'the clearer it became that the message did not represent a terrorist threat, or any other form of threat, but was a 'conversation piece' for Mr Chambers’ followers.

It was not sent to anyone at the airport or anyone responsible for airport security, or any form of public security. The language and punctuation were inconsistent with the writer intending it to be, or to be taken as, a serious warning.

There was no urgent response to it from the airport and police action was 'not exactly hurried'.

Lord Judge said that, while proper respect must be paid to the Crown Court’s finding, that did not address the unbroken pattern of evidence to be derived from the responses of those who read the message, and no weight appeared to have been given to the lack of urgency which characterised the approach of the authorities.

Outside court, Mr Chambers said that as a result of the prosecution he had lost two jobs and become 'unemployable'.

'It’s been two-and-a-half years. At the moment I’m just feeling relieved. The Lord Chief Justice just seemed to get it.'

He added: 'It’s an important decision as far as social networks are concerned and as far as Twitter is concerned. It has established that there has to be an action that is menacing and is intended to be menacing. It’s a very big decision for people doing what human beings do - telling a joke sometimes, even if it’s a bad one.'

Comedian Murray, who arrived to lend his support, said the case had been 'ridiculous'.

'In 100 years there will be an operetta about this - about how ridiculous we were at the start of the 21st century. I’m a big fan of absurdity but this is taking the biscuit.'

He added: 'Paul was doing what we all do sometimes in the heat of the moment.'
