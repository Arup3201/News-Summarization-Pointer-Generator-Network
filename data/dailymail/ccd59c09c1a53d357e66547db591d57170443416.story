For most young people the summer months mean the end of studying, but also the start of a lowly-paid temp job...unless you're one of the 'rich kids of Instagram.'

For them the lazy weeks include trips to exotic lands on private jets, blissful days by their private pool and riding around in their customized sports cars. 

They use the photo app Instagram to parade snippets of their luxurious lifestyles which are usually funded by the bank of mum and dad.

Their boastful photos hit the the headline a few months ago and once again Tumblr have collected the best of the best, labelling it simply ‘Rich Kids of Instagram’ and letting the pictures speak for themselves.

No matter how busy they are enjoying the moment - be it sliding off Daddy's yacht, tucking into a feast of food or riding an elephant on safari, the number one rule for the rich kids of Instagram is to take a photo.

The latest offering from Tumblr include an eye-watering drinks bill from the playground of the rich and famous, a 'rich kid' being blasted into the sky using a water jet-pack and a golden weapon - presumably gold-plated if the rich kids live up to their name.

Their new way of showcasing their life even has its own hashtag on Twitter - RKOI (Rich Kids Of Instagram).

But life isn't always rosy for the rich kids - they can get in trouble for over-sharing their ostentatious lives.

Last week the billionaire CEO of the computer giant Dell Inc has learned the hard way that money cannot buy a sense of security, especially when efforts to keep the family safe are being thwarted from within - by his own daughter.

Michael Dell’s 18-year-old daughter, Alexa, has been posting potentially too much information on social networks - last week, she posted a photo of her 
brother, Zachary, on Rich Kids of Instagram 
depicting the magnate’s son devouring a luxurious buffet on his way to 
Fiji.

Unlike most young web users eager to 
open their lives to the world with little or no regard for privacy, Ms 
Dell happens to be the daughter of a tycoon worth $15.9billion who 
occupies the 41st slot on Forbes Magazine’s Billionaires’ List.

His daughter’s online over-sharing 
likely did not sit well with Mr Dell, who pays about $2.7million a year 
for the security protection of his family, according to Dell’s 
regulatory filings.

By Friday, Alexa Dell’s Twitter 
account has been shut down for unspecified reasons.

Dell officials have 
declined to comment on whether security concerns were behind the move.
