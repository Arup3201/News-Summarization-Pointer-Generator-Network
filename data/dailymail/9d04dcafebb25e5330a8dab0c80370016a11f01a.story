The Government is owed £22billion – enough to give every taxpayer a £750 rebate or build 1,500 new schools.

A report by the Commons Public Accounts Committee reveals a further £32billion has been written off over the last five years – equal to more than £1,000 per taxpayer.

Most of the debt stems from uncollected taxes, but huge sums are also owed in overpaid benefits and tax credits, unpaid court fines and student loans. Much of it has languished uncollected for years, with little prospect of ever being recovered.

Commons Public Accounts Committee chairman, Labour MP Margaret Hodge said the Government had 'failed' to manage the debt which she said was 'just not good enough'

The committee’s chairman, Labour MP Margaret Hodge, said: ‘The Government has failed to take a strategic, cross-government approach to managing that debt. Instead, its treatment of debt has been characterised by neglect and periodic large write-offs.

‘In the current climate of tight public finances, that’s just not good enough.’

HM Revenue and Customs is the worst offender, with total debts of £15.1billion, including £3billion in overpaid tax credits and £1.5billion in uncollected corporation tax.

MPs warn this creates ‘unfairness and injustice’ to those who pay their taxes on time and effectively subsidises those who do not.

The Government aims to slash unpaid debts by £10billion, but the report warns it is unclear how it will achieve this and is likely to ‘fail’.
