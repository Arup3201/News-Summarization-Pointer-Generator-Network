Wiping away tears before sharing a passionate kiss for the cameras, new NFL pick Michael Sam and his boyfriend were the picture of joy on Saturday.

As the photograph of their embrace quickly spread across the internet, Sam celebrated being the first openly-gay player drafted to the NFL - and viewers wondered about the identity of his man.

He has now been named as Vito Cammisano, a 23-year-old fellow University of Missouri alum, who starred on the school's swim team - and who apparently comes from one of the state's most infamous mobster families.

Online records indicate that he is the grandson of William 'Willie Rat' Cammisano. The mob leader served time in prison for extortion and contempt of Congress in the 80s, AP reported.

After a long rap sheet of crimes from theft to bootlegging, accusations of murder, and refusing to cooperate with a Congressional probe into the mob, he passed away in 1995, aged 80.

After his death, his son, William 'Willie' Cammisano Jr., took over the reins but he was arrested in 2010 for running a $3.5 million illegal sports betting organization and sentenced to a year and a day in prison, according to a release from the Department of Justice.

His brother - Vito's father - Jerry Cammisano, was also swept up in the family business and served 14 months in federal prison and ordered to pay more than $200,000 for his part in leading the sports betting ring, according to the release.

Records show Jerry Cammisano began his sentence in February 2011, and photographs show him grinning beside Vito at his graduation ceremony last year, indicating he did not serve further time.

It is not clear if the ring placed bets 
on football games. At least five other men, aged between 27 and 54, were charged in connection to the betting ring.

Leader: Their father William Cammisano Sr. was a mob leader based in Kansas City. He died in 1995

There is also no indication that Vito Cammisano, a 
star athlete and student, has had any involvement in the family's 
illegal activities.

The family has not returned MailOnline's calls requesting comment.

Vito Cammisano is the youngest child of 60-year-old Jerry and his wife Josephine, 57. They also have two older daughters, 
Antoinette - who is married - and Mariann, according to the University of Missouri's athletics website.

The site explains that he started swimming aged five and attended Rockhurst High School in Kansas 
City before heading to the university, where he majored in 
communications and starred on the swim team between 2009 and 2012.

According to the site, 5ft 9 Cammisano came fifth in the 1,650 freestyle and 10th 
in the 500 freestyle consolation event at the Big 12 conference 
championships as a freshman.

He came out to fellow swimmers in 2011, the university newspaper 
reported. He said that he did not receive any negative comments 
afterwards.

The Missourian reported that Cammisano publicly credited Greg DeStephen, the first openly-gay 
Missouri athlete, for helping him with his announcement.

'I'm completely appreciative that 
Greg did everything he could to make that possible for people that came 
after him,' he said.

Cammisano
 has been working as a promotions intern at Cumulus Broadcasting, which 
operates radio stations in the U.S., for around five months, according 
to his LinkedIn profile.

His work history reveals he also worked in the Office of Disability Services while at university.

Although the couple kept their relationship 
quiet, when Sam publicly revealed he was gay earlier this year, 
Cammisano posted an image of them smiling side-by-side to Instagram.

'After
 all these years... it's nice to see a picture of you two,' one friend 
wrote beneath the photograph, indicating the length of their 
relationship.

On Saturday, the couple 
were snapped kissing at Sam's agent's San Diego home, before heading to 
Tao nightclub in Las Vegas, where they partied until 3am on Sunday, the 
Las Vegas Sun reported.

'We are staying home! Could not be more proud of my babe,' Cammisano tweeted after the St. Louis Rams picked Sam, 24, near the end of the final round on Saturday.

Cammisano's relatives told the New York Daily News they were proud of him and his man.

'He's been a pleasant, pleasant boy all his life,' Cammisano's aunt, Cathy Nigro, said, adding of the kiss: 'I was very proud of them both. I think the whole family is.'
