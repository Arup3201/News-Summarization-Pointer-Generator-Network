An estranged Florida couple's fight over whether to circumcise their son has become a rallying cry for those who denounce the procedure as barbaric.

The dispute between the one-time Palm Beach County couple, who never married, has sparked a prolonged court battle, protests and the rapt attention of a movement of self-proclaimed 'intactivists'.

The mother initially agreed to the circumcision, but later decided she opposed it. The father favors the procedure.

Florida mom Heather Hironimus, pictured with son Chase, opposes his circumcision - but judges ruled in favor of the father last month, meaning surgery is likely

Judges have ruled in favor of the father, meaning the surgery is likely.

Anti-circumcision advocates have made the case their cause celebre and organized a series of protests.

Circumcision rates have fallen in the U.S., but a majority of boys still undergo the removal of their foreskin.

The couple and their son were named by the Sun-Sentinel as Heather Hironimus, Dennis Nebus and four-year-old  Chase.

Neither the boy's mother nor father are Jewish, the paper reported last month. 

The dad has previously said he believes circumcision is 'just the normal thing to do', according to reports. 

In December, the boy's mother argued that the process was not medically necessary and risks posing physical and mental damage to her son.

The 4th District Court of Appeal in West Palm Beach denied her request.

Heather Hironimus gave birth to her son Chase with Dennis Nebus in October 2010.

In December 2011, she signed a parenting agreement, agreeing to circumcision but over time changed her mind, arguing that her son is now older and more aware of what is happening to him. 

According to a campaign website, Saving Chase, a pediatric urologist Dr. Charles Flack also testified in court that circumcision was not medically necessary for the child. 

A statement read: 'Genital autonomy advocates believe Chase's physical and mental health are at risk. He is aware of his body and does not want to have surgery on his genitals. 

'Amputating a healthy, functional body part is a violation of basic human rights and medical ethics.'
