West Brom have revealed that the club will dedicate one of this season's home games to club legend Jeff Astle to help raise awareness of head injuries in football.

Astle passed away in 2002 from a degenerative brain disease which made his widow Laraine and daughters Dawn and Claire launch the Justice for Jeff campaign in a bid to make the game safer.

As well as a one-match tribute, an image of Astle will be shown on the big screens at the Hawthorns in honour of the No 9 shirt he wore between 1964 and 1974.

Baggies chairman Jeremy Peace told the club's official website: 'We have held several constructive meetings with Laraine, Dawn and Claire this summer to discuss ways in which we can help the family in their endeavours to make the game safer at all levels.

'They have been pleased with our proposals and we will continue working closely with them during the coming season.

'The family have gone to extraordinary lengths to highlight the risks associated with head injuries in football. Their efforts are a fitting tribute to Jeff, who will always be a West Bromwich Albion legend.'
