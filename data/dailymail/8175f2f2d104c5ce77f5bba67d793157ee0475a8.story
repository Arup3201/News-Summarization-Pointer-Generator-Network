Former F1 world champion Fernando Alonso was so badly concussed in his pre-season crash last month that when he regained consciousness he had forgotten the past 20 years of his life, it has been reported.

Alonso, who races for McLaren-Honda, crashed at 150mph on February 22 during pre-season testing and was rushed to hospital where he spent three days under observation.

Asked by doctors who he was, what sort of work he was in and what he wanted to be in the future, he replied: 'I'm Fernando, I drive go karts and I want to be a Formula 1 driver,' it is claimed.

McLaren-Honda claimed doctors found Alonso to be 'asymptomatic' with 'no evidence whatsoever of any injury'. Here he is pictured in hospital following the accident

Two days ago McLaren-Honda stated doctors had found the 33-year-old to be 'asymptomatic', with 'no evidence whatsoever of any injury' and 'entirely healthy from neurological and cardiac perspectives'.

However, worrying reports in Spain's El Pais newspaper suggest his concussion was so severe when doctors asked him questions he thought it was 1995 and aged 13.

The paper also claimed he could not remember his F1 debut in 2001, the victories of his beloved Real Madrid or his two world championship titles and it took him a week to recover these memories.

Meanwhile, McLaren-Honda confirmed two days ago that he would be sitting out the start of the F1 season on doctors' advice.

A spokesperson said: 'His doctors have advised that he should not compete in the imminent Australian Grand Prix meeting, which will take place on March 13th, 14th and 15th.

'Fernando has understood and accepted that advice, and the two McLaren-Honda cars will therefore be driven in Australia by Fernando’s team-mate Jenson Button and the team’s test and reserve driver Kevin Magnussen.'

McLaren did not respond to MailOnline's request for comment.

The Spaniard was then airlifted by helicopter to hospital following the crash, which happened during the final day of the Formula One pre-season test at the Circuit de Barcelona Catalunya.

At the time, McLaren said the two-time former world champion was 'conscious and able to speak' while receiving first aid at the circuit's medical centre, but had been taken to hospital for 'precautionary checks'.

After several hours of tests and observation, the team later added that Alonso was 'uninjured' but had suffered concussion in the accident, which took place just before turn four on the track.

Although he was technically given a clean bill of health after sustaining concussion in the heavy crash, the fear of 'second-impact syndrome' forced him out of the start of the racing season.

The term refers to a second concussion occurring when the effects of the first are still subsiding, potentially resulting in severe brain injuries, or even death.

Although the timespan between the accident and Alonso returning to the car for first practice in Melbourne on March 13 would appear to be sufficient, he is not prepared to take any risks.

Via his Twitter account, he said: 'It will be tough not to be in Australia, but I understand the recommendations. A second impact in less than 21 days 'NO' #countdownMalaysia.'

Alonso tweeted his disappointment at not being able to make the season-opening F1 grand prix in Australia

For the Albert Park event his seat will be occupied by Kevin Magnussen, demoted to reserve driver following the Spaniard's arrival after a full season with the team in 2014.

A thrilled Magnussen, who will partner Jenson Button in Melbourne, tweeted: 'Shame about the circumstances but still I'm so excited to be racing in Melbourne. Can't wait!!'

Alonso rejoined McLaren this season after a disappointing fifth and final campaign with Ferrari. He won back-to-back world titles with Renault in 2005 and 2006 before spending one season at McLaren in 2007.

Alonso has 32 career grand prix victories, the last of which came at Montmelo in 2013.
