Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe was fatally shot in the head as he got out of his car to approach a suspicious-looking vehicle

Murdered garda Adrian Donohoe’s colleague was warned that he too would be shot in the head if he attempted to help his dying friend.

The chilling and heartless warning stopped Detective Joe Ryan in his tracks as he ran to the aid of his partner, who had been blasted in the head with a shotgun during a botched robbery.

‘They shouted at Detective Ryan not to take another step. He watched as they shot his colleague and was told he too would be shot if he took another step,’ a well placed source revealed.

The two detectives had arrived at 9.30pm on Friday to escort staff who were about to transfer €10,000 from the Lordship Credit Union at Bellurgan, near Dundalk in Co. Louth – just half a mile from Adrian Donohoe’s family home – after closing for the night.

As they entered the credit union car park, Detectives Donohoe and Ryan saw a suspicious-looking  dark-coloured car parked there, with three men inside it. A fourth man was waiting by the car as if on lookout.

Det Donohoe made to step out of the car to investigate but before he could even stand up properly, one of the men opened fire without warning and shot him once in the head with a shotgun.

The source said: ‘Detective Ryan was told he too would be shot if he took another step. The gang then took the keys of the garda car before taking off.

‘They clearly panicked once they saw Adrian get out of the car but they were cool enough to take their keys.

‘And this was all for the sake of small money. It’s beyond belief.

‘They didn’t even give him a chance. No words were exchanged and he did not have his weapon in sight. He was shot before he even got a chance to stand up as he got out of the car.

‘He fell to the ground and died instantly. It’s absolutely appalling. The whole community is devastated – he was a very popular family man.’

The men, who are understood to have been carrying a handgun as well as the shotgun, then drove erratically out of the village as Detective Ryan frantically called for backup.

Adrian Donohoe’s wife is said to be ‘in bits’ over the senseless murder.

Caroline Donohoe is being comforted by her family and friends at her home in Bellurgan, Co. Louth, where she lives with her two young children.

Poignantly, the credit union is located opposite the school where the dead man’s children, a seven-year old girl and six year old boy, are educated.

Mrs Donohoe, who also works as a Garda in Dundalk, where her husband was stationed for nearly two decades, has appealed for privacy while she comes to terms with her loss.

A massive manhunt is now under way to track down the killers. Last night, gardaí said they were doing ‘everything in their power’ to bring the perpetrators to justice. Early suspects include a Coolock-based gang in north Dublin. All the major national units including the Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Special Detective Unit and Air Support Unit are involved.

Our exclusive aerial images show the scene of the horror shooting at the rural credit union, which is opposite the local Catholic Church.

The scene is now sealed off for technical examination.

It has been 17 years since a Garda was shot dead in Ireland. In 1996, Jerry McCabe was shot in the head as he escorted an An Post van in Adare, Co. Limerick.

Yesterday, Superintendent David Taylor described the scene of Adrian Donohoe’s murder as ‘chaotic’ and said gardaí were still trying to piece together the exact details.

‘This is a cold-blooded murder,’ he said. ‘Detective Donohoe had just alighted from the car. The scene was chaotic and we don’t have the exact timeline. He just stepped out of the car and was fatally wounded.

‘Detective Ryan is absolutely traumatised. It was a traumatic event for him to witness. His life was under threat too.’

Supt Taylor said Mrs Donohoe was ‘shattered’ over her husband’s death.

‘She is in bits,’ said Supt Taylor. ‘They have a very young family and they are absolutely in bits.

‘We are particularly interested in a dark coloured car that was seen driving in an erratic manner leaving the scene.

‘We have no indication which direction it went, north or south, and do not have registration details.

Supt Taylor added: ‘Dr Khalid Jabber attended the scene and later last night the remains of Detective Donohoe were removed to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda where a full post mortem was carried out today.’

Garda Commissioner Martin Callinan, Deputy Commissioner Noreen O’Sullivan and Kieran Kenny, Assistant Commissioner for the area all attended the scene yesterday. Mr Callinan described the murder as a ‘sad day for Ireland’.

Assistant Commissioner for National Support Derek Byrne is understood to have cut his holiday in Abu Dhabi short and was on his way home last night.

In what he called a ‘cry for help’ in tracking down the killers, Mr Callinan pledged: ‘I want to assure the family that we will be doing everything in our power to bring the perpetrators of this terrible murder to justice.

‘It is a very, very sad day for An Garda Siochána and for Ireland. We were deeply shocked and saddened by the murder of our colleague while he was carrying out his duty.

‘I just want to say at this time is that my thoughts, and the thoughts of everyone in An Garda Siochána and I am sure the wider community are with the Donohoe family and their immediate and extended families, particularly with Caroline and their two young children.

‘I was in contact last night with the family through my colleagues. Obviously, there is great upset and sensitivity involved so we have to allow them some time.

‘I have received overwhelming support from the Government, from my minister, from the President and many, many more political and community leaders and we deeply appreciate that.

‘This is a cry for help for An Garda Siochána,’ he said.

‘There are people out there who are aware of who these people are and I appeal to those people to come forward and help us. Society needs to make some choices here. We do need the public’s help and this is an opportunity for them to come forward.

‘Up to four people involved in the actual raid and how many were involved beyond that will remain to be seen.

‘We will put all our energy into finding out who precisely was behind this robbery.

‘It is too early to speculate if there is a subversive element in relation to this or if they are criminals, ordinary criminals.’ He described Adrian Donohoe as a ‘popular and effective’ garda who was highly respected by his peers and the community.

Superintendent Dave Taylor from the Garda Press Office said a massive manhunt was now under way.

‘This is a cold-blooded murder,’ he said. ‘Detective Donohoe had just alighted from the car and was fatally wounded.’

Police hunt for clues at the crime scene near Dundalk yesterday

Adrian Donohoe was involved in a number of high-profile investigations last year. He led a probe that resulted in three men being convicted of extorting €67,000 from their victim in 2009.

The men were jailed for terms of eight to 10 years. Det Garda Donohoe told a sentence hearing in Dublin last summer that the victim was still living in fear and was considering emigrating following the incident.

‘Everybody is deeply saddened and shocked by what is happened.’

Popular Adrian Donohoe was highly involved in GAA and managed the Louth Garda team that competed in a Garda inter-country competition in 2010. Tributes have been pouring in since his death. Louth TD Fergus O’Dowd said the community was reeling from the tragic news.

‘It’s absolutely devastating. It’s a shocking crime that a garda has been killed in such terrible circumstances. He was obviously a very brave and committed man. It’s an awful tragedy.’

Fianna Fáil justice spokesman Niall Collins said he had contacted the Garda Commissioner to express his sadness at the news and pass on his condolences to his family.

Local Labour TD Ged Nash expressed his disgust at the news.

‘I want to express my sincere condolences to the family and the Garda his colleague’s in Louth and in the force across the country,’ he said. ‘There is a real sense of shock right across the country.

‘It’s a disgraceful and heinous act. It is the worst possible crime to kill a Garda in the line of duty when he is out there protecting the community. It is murder.

Paddy Clarke, a garage owner beside Dundalk Garda Station, said he knew Adrian well and described him as a ‘lovely, family man’.

‘He used to come in for his coffee all the time and always had a smile on his face. He would park his car at my garage before going to work and his wife would collect it later that evening.

‘I always had great time for him, he was the best man you could meet.’

Gardaí have appealed for any witnesses to come forward and have asked for the public to contact them the Dundalk incident room on (042) 938 8470 or the Garda confidential line
