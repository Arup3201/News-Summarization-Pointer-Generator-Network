Dubious value: Many couples buy a baby sling and never actually use it

Couples spend £1,600 preparing for their first baby – but many of their purchases are never used.

The most common items that new parents regret buying are baby slings, Moses baskets and specialised mum-to-be toiletries, a poll has found.

The cost of preparing for the arrival of a first baby has jumped by 17 per cent since 2012, when the poll was first carried out. Then, couples typically spent £1,398.

And there is further financial pressure on new parents as many also find it necessary to upgrade their home and car at the same time.

One in five move to a bigger property, typically from a flat to a house, according to the poll of 2,000 parents with children under five, carried out by insurance firm Aviva.

On average, they spent around £40,000 on the move, although one in seven movers spent 'more than £150,000 to upsize' their home, typically from a flat to a small house.

Many couples leave the move to the last minute, enduring a stressful period of trying to buy a new home and decorate it as the baby's due date approaches.

More than a quarter of new parents also either bought a car, or changed their existing car, before their baby arrived.

On average, they spent £5,298, which is more than three times the average monthly take-home pay.

The average full-time worker earns £27,000 and gets a salary of £1,708 a month after paying their tax bill.

Louise Colley, a director of Aviva and a mother of six-year-old twins, said 'It is only natural that people want to give their baby the best of everything, particularly when they're about to become parents for the first time.

'It is also interesting that most new parents admit they've spent money on items they didn't need or never used.' The amount of money spent by parents has jumped by 17 per cent since Aviva did the same poll two years in 2012 when new parents typically spent £1,398.

Pointless? Moses baskets scored highly on the list of baby gear parents regret buying

Of the £1,619 now spent by new parents before their first baby arrives, the most expensive item was a pram or pushchair, typically costing £225.

This is followed by £160 on furniture for the nursery, such as a nappy changing table, £152 on a cot and a mattress for it, and £143 on baby clothes.

Other items include a car seat (£89), maternity clothes (£119), baby toys (£131) and a nursing chair used while breastfeeding or bottle feeding the baby (£106).

While a third install a smoke alarm, more than half install stair gates to stop their children falling down the stairs and 40 per cent put safety catches on their kitchen cupboards, the majority have no life insurance.

Overall, the Aviva study estimates parents spend a total of nearly £500million a year getting ready for their first baby's arrival.

Official figures show around 800,000 babies are born each year in the UK. Of the total, nearly four in ten are born to first-time mothers.

The poll is based on interviews, which took place this month, with 2,000 parents who have children under the age of five.
