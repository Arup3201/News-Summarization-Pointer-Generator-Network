A personal trainer was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer after doctors mistook a lump on his right knee for a pulled muscle.  

Stuart Brookes has now been told he has just 18 months to live after the disease returned for a second time in  two years.

He was first diagnosed with myxoid liposarcoma - a rare soft tissue cancer - in November 2012.

Despite initially being told the disease was completely curable, tests just months later revealed it had spread throughout his body.

Now the 30-year-old is trying to raise £150,000 to travel to the US to take part in a potentially life-saving clinical trial.

When Mr Brookes, pictured with Miss Ispavaskaya left, and his nephew William, right, first went to see a GP, complaining of a lump behind his right knee, the doctor mistook the tumour for a pulled muscle

With no cure available for him in the UK, Mr Brookes believes travelling to Washington state to receive a unique treatment could be his last hope.

Patients at a hospital there are taking part in a trial where cancer patients are given a vaccine.

The theory is the body will recognise the cancer as a disease and will fight it itself.

Mr Brookes, who is originally from Birmingham but now lives in London, visited his GP in the summer of 2012 after finding a lump behind his right knee. 

'It took a while for me to go to the doctors, as it didn't hurt,' Mr Brookes said. 'The doctor said I had pulled a muscle, but I wasn't convinced.

'I was in the process of moving down to London at the time, so it was another three months before my missus forced me to do something about it.

'In the end the lump was almost the size of my fist.'

After visiting another GP in London, he was sent for an MRI scan and a biopsy at Kingston Hospital.

The tests revealed the lump was cancerous and he was diagnosed with metastatic myxoid liposarcoma.

It is a very rare form of sarcoma - a cancer of the soft tissue - and affects the connective tissues.

The disease usually presents as a painless slow-growing lump, and can often by misdiagnosed as a result.

The tumours are usually confined to the extremities, particularly the thigh.

'I was told it was completely curable,' said Mr Brookes. 'It was a bit worrying as I was going into the unknown.

Over the course of the next three months the lump continued to grow, until it reached the size of a fist. He returned to see another GP, this time in London after moving, and was referred for a biopsy and MRI scan. The tests revealed the lump was cancerous and Mr Brookes began treatment immediately

In March 2013, surgeons a the Royal Marsden Hospital, removed the lump. Mr Brookes also faced rounds of radiotherapy and chemotherapy to try and treat the cancer

'But I was mainly concerned about how it would affect my leg, and my job as a personal trainer.

'To be honest, I was worried if there would be scar tissue, and whether I would be crippled afterwards.'

Once he had received his diagnosis, Mr Brookes started a five-week course of radiotherapy.

He then had surgery at the Royal Marsden Hospital to remove the tumour in March 2013. 

Surgeons cut through the back of his leg and lifted up parts of his hamstring to remove the tumour. 

He said: 'The operation went really well, they removed everything. I was able to do a lot of the rehabilitation myself.'

For the next nine months Mr Brookes worked on his recovery, and underwent regular check ups to monitor the cancer with CT scans and to drain fluid from his leg.

But it was then that he noticed lumps on his left leg and upper back.

Mr Brookes has been diagnosed with metastatic myxoid liposarcoma.

It is a very rare form of sarcoma - a cancer of the soft tissue - and affects the connective tissues.

It typically affects adults aged 40 to 60 years old.

The disease usually presents as a painless slow-growing lump, and can often by misdiagnosed as a result.

The tumours are usually confined to the extremities, particularly the thigh.

The size of the tumour and where it is, affects a patient's prognosis, with tumours smaller than 10 to 15cm having a better survival rate.

In around half of cases, the disease spreads to other parts of the body, commonly to the lungs.

'When I went back to my doctors they weren't very optimistic, and I could tell it wasn't going to be good news,' he said. 'They looked very worried.'

Mr Brookes, who lives with girlfriend Alina and her 12-year-old son Max, was sent for more tests which revealed his cancer was back.

An MRI scan showed the stage 4 cancer had spread to his hip, spine and pelvis, and doctors told him he had around 18 months to live.

'It felt as thought two or three people were trying to prepare me to die,' he said. 

'One said, "we can make you feel as good as we can for as long as possible".

'My GP asked me what I wanted to do with my time. I didn't want to sit and make a bucket list.

'They didn't even give me any advice about diet - they told me I could eat whatever I wanted. Even for a healthy person, that isn't good advice.

'I didn't want to sit and dwell, I want to fight it, so I asked for a new team.'

Mr Brookes, who loves football, surfing and running, was finding it difficult to walk due to the pain in his hip.

With a new specialist team he started another, more intense round of radiotherapy, this time for two weeks.

In the meantime he started doing his own research into clinical trials available both in France and in America, as well as changing to a special low-sugar diet to try and starve the cancer cells.

He also started practising yoga and meditation to give him a positive and healthy mentality.

'I had been told that radiotherapy and chemotherapy wouldn't cure me,' said Mr Brookes.

For nine months, Mr Brookes worked on his recovery. But he then noticed more lumps that had appeared on his left leg and upper back. Tests confirmed the cancer had returned. Doctors told him the disease had spread to his hip, spine and pelvis and gave him just 18 months to live

Determined not to give up, Mr Brookes, pictured with (from L to R) his mother Lesley, twin sister Sarah and nan Eileen, began to research clinical trials in the US

'But I wanted to talk to someone detached from the medical profession, like a research professor.

'In the UK there are clinical trials available, but I had to have chemotherapy, and that is not something I want to put my body through.'

Eventually he tracked down Robin Jones, a professor at the division of medical oncology at the University of Washington in Seattle, who explained to him the current trials being carried out in the US.

But because Mr Brookes isn't a US citizen, if he wants to qualify for the trials he will have to pay for the treatment himself, at a cost of up to £150,000.

'It felt great to talk to him,' he said. 'He was the first person not to just pooh-pooh everything.

'He has since moved over to England, and we were able to sit down and talk it through.

'He told me about Dr Seth Pollack who is running a trial where you are given a vaccine, as though you had mumps or measles, and your body will recognise the cancer as a disease and will fight it itself.'

Now friends and family are determined to get Mr Brookes over to America for the potentially life-saving trial, and they are on a fundraising mission to raise the money in the next few months.

Friend Richard Burton has set up a website, and friends and even strangers have started to donate to the urgent cause.

'I guess my friends just haven't had enough of me yet,' added Mr Brookes. 'They may regret it when I'm well again.

'Friends who I haven't spoken to for years have got in touch and donated. There is not really a way I can thank them.

'It can often be more difficult for the people closest to me, than for me.

'But I am writing it all down in a blog at the moment, and maybe that could be one way to give back when I publish it.'

Family and friends are now trying to raise more than £150,000 to fund Mr Brookes's trip to the US, to Washington State where he hopes to enrol on a clinical trial that is testing a new vaccine-like drug for cancer

Mr Brookes, who is a personal trainer, said: 'This is an opportunity without which, I don't really have any kind of hope'

Mr Brookes hopes to travel out to the US at the end of the month for some holistic treatments, and to talk to Dr Pollock and hopefully put plans in place to start treatment.

He said: 'They can't tell me whether the trial will work.

'But this is an opportunity without which, I don't really have any kind of hope.'

Kayleigh Smith, who has known Stuart for 13 years, urged people to donate to his treatment.

She said: 'Stu is just a great all round guy really. He can brighten up any situation with his unique sense of humour.

'He's always been willing to help out friends when they needed it.

'Despite going through treatments, Stu goes out of his way to help any of his friends, no matter what.

'During his time as a personal trainer he has helped so many people change their lives, so please help us return the favour.'
