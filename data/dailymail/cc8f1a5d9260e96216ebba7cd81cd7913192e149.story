With the new Premier League season less than a week away, Kevin Mirallas has been stepping up his efforts to be fit for Everton's opener against newly promoted Leicester.

The 26-year-old only returned from holiday last week after helping Belgium reach the quarter-finals of the World Cup and manager Roberto Martinez has admitted that he may not be ready to play at the Walkers Stadium on Saturday.

But Mirallas, who helped the Toffees finish fifth in the Spaniard's first season at the helm, appears determined to be involved after being filmed working out in the club's Finch Farm gym by his international team-mate Romelu Lukaku.

The striker, who moved to Goodison Park for £28million in late July after a successful loan spell, shared the clip of Mirallas on Instagram along with the caption 'Working to get fit @kmirallas11 !!'. 

The ex-Chelsea forward can also be saying: 'Working on his fitness all day, every day, Mr Mirallas' before shouting some words of encouragement to his compatriot. 

Both Belgians are yet to play in pre-season and Martinez is unsure whether they will be ready to face Nigel Pearson's side.

The former Wigan boss said: 'When you have players coming back from the World Cup you have to decide if you want the players straight away or do you give them a bit of time to refresh and be ready to play for 10 months?

'It will only be Kevin Mirallas and Rom who might not start the season. For Romelu, it will depend on how he adapts to work from now until August 16.

'There is a degree of risk if you put them into a situation so early. They've been training really well and are accumulating a lot of work.'

The Foxes emerged victorious when the two sides met in a friendly in Thailand late last month, with a Gary Taylor-Fletcher goal enough to separate them.
