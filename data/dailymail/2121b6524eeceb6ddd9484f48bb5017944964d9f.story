Two young Mormons are to return home from their missions after learning that their family died of suspected carbon monoxide poisoning.

Formally known as Latter-day Saints, Sister Jensen Parrish, 22, was based at the Washington Vancouver Mission, while her brother, Elder Ian Parrish, 20, was serving at the South Dakota Rapid City Mission.

The pair have been released on leave after they were told that their mother, Ross, father, Bill, and brothers Keegan, 14, and Liam, 12, died over the weekend at their home in Pocatello, Idaho.

Sometimes referred to as the ‘silent killer’, carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas that has no smell or taste.

Some 150 Americans die from carbon monoxide poisoning each year.

The symptoms can be similar to those of food poisoning and influenza, with dizziness, vomiting and stomach pain often experienced.

The gas is produced by fuels such as gas, coal, oil or wood when they do not burn fully.

On Saturday, the manager of a popular Long Island restaurant died and 27 others required medical attention after a carbon monoxide leak filled a mall.

Police said the deceased, Steven Nelson, 55, was discovered after a female employee fell and hit her head in Legal Sea Foods in South Huntington.

The family are thought to have died from carbon monoxide poisoning on Saturday night or Sunday morning, though it is not clear which gas-based appliance is to blame.

The alarm was raised after the four did not turn up for a weekly extended family dinner on Sunday night and would not answer their phones.

Sister Jenson Parrish was 13 months into her 18-month stay where she was acting as an American Sign Language missionary, according to Deseret News.

Her younger brother, meanwhile, was 18 months into a two-year stint and was a zone leader working in North Dakota.

Both missionaries have now been told they can return home and have been placed on leave.

Sister Jensen Parrish is said to have a major role to play in a zone conference on Tuesday morning, and has been asked to stay for that before returning home on Tuesday afternoon when her brother, who is working six hours from his home, is also expected home.

‘Both are anxious to come home and unsure what their future holds,’ family spokesman, and the pair’s uncle, Craig Parrish said. ‘They'll be okay. There will be hard days ahead, but there are a bunch of us here for them.’

He said their family was ‘very, very close’ and that the weekly Sunday dinner can draw up to 30 people, including his cousin, Bill, and his family.

According to the website, Bannock County Coroner Kim Quick told the media that the family are believed to have died from carbon monoxide poisoning. It is not yet clear which gas-based appliance caused the deaths.

The Parrishes were part of a large extended family who met for dinner every Sunday evening in Idaho
