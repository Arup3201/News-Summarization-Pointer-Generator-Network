A Bar Mitzvah is a coming-of-age celebration and one 13-year-old teen decided to mark his transition into manhood by channelling his inner Madonna and 'vogueing.'

Shaun Sperling kicked off the party in a northwest suburb of Chicago by taking to the dance floor and performing the pop star's famous song Vogue.

The clip was filmed on March 14, 1992, but now twenty years later Shaun has finally decided to share his moves with the world and posted the video online - unsurprisingly it immediately went viral.

True Madonna fan: Shaun starts the dance posing before launching into his performance

Surprise: After he whipped of his suit jacket, Shaun revealed Madonna's face was printed on the back of his shirt

At the start of the video, Shaun takes to the dance floor wearing a smart suit jacket.

But he soon whips it off to reveal Madonna's face printed on the back of his white shirt.

As he begins his dance, the spectators start whooping and clapping with encouragement.

Not that Shaun needs any reassurance - in the five minute clip he confidently rolls out all the moves from her monochrome video.

Madonna had released the chart-topping song two years previously in 1990 and clearly Shaun used the time that passed to learn her famous moves.

At one point he even gets on the floor, resting on one hand while he throws his head back.

At the end of the performance Shaun walked over to the edge of the dance floor and retrieves his jacket - but not before he got a kiss from a proud lady in peach.

The theme of the Bar Mitzvah was evident to the guests from the start - the final shot shows a giant Madonna poster above the DJ stand.

Showcasing his skill: The video has already been viewed by over 40,000 people since it was posted online earlier this week

The video has already been viewed over 40,000 times since it was posted online by Shaun last week.

One user commented: 'I hope Shaun Sperling is just as cool in 2012 as he was in 1992!﻿ If not cooler...'

Another internet user wrote: 'Shaun, 
this made my day! You are so wonderful - and to be that young and 
fearless and that in love with Madonna...I think we are about the same 
age and﻿ I say bravo to you!'

Finished: At the end of the performance Shaun walked over to the edge of the dancefloor and retrieved his jacket - but not before he got a kiss from a proud lady in peach

Superfan: The theme of the Bar Mitzvah should have been obvious as this poster was on the wall above the DJ
