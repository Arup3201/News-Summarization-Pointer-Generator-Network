When money in their current account and savings is added to the value of their homes, car and belongings, the average Briton is worth nearly £150,000

The average Briton is worth nearly £150,000, according to a study.

This includes an average current pension pot of £30,000 and mortgage equity of £75,000.

Yet the survey found nearly half of us have no idea how much we are worth, while 42 per cent do not think they are worth very much at all.

However, the average adult has £1,348.16 in a current account, £5,603.98 stored away in a savings account and a further £3,712.65 in an ISA.

With a car valued at £6,706.55 and home contents worth £15,077.90, average net worth tots up to £147,134.

The
 survey of 2,000 adults by solicitors Irwin Mitchell also found that 
despite substantial assets, six in ten adults do not have a will, while a
 third have no plans to make one.

Gillian
 Coverley, a wills expert at the law firm, said: 'Many British adults 
feel they have very few assets to their name and consequently is it not 
worth them making a will.

'But
 the reality is very different in that most people will have assets tied
 up in investments they wouldn't even think would count.

'So
 while the average British adult doesn't have millions tucked away, they
 should still make sensible provisions and arrangements for their 
future.'

Around
 half the people surveyed don't know how assets are distributed after 
death, while 54 per cent are clueless about what accounts and 
investments their partner or family has.

Despite their increasing wealth, six in ten adults do not have a will and a third have no plans to make one

Ms
 Coverley added: 'Planning for the future is vital. Many people are 
attempting to save money by not making wills and then when the 
inevitable happens, they do it themselves in relation to the estate 
administration.

'What they find is that this is a specialist area of law and there are potentially serious pitfalls.

'While
 some may feel they can save money by avoiding legal advice, our 
experience is that such an outlook can create a false economy.

'This
 is because ultimately, if they do go it alone and subsequently hit 
problems, then it can be more expensive to sort out the situation in the
 long run.

'Common
 issues from failing to take advice include incorrectly distributing the
 estate and a lack of awareness of the tax issues which surround 
administering an estate - this can lead to missed tax deadlines and 
potential penalty charges.

'Also,
 with specialist advice, they may be able to look at ways to reduce the 
burden of inheritance tax to the benefit of families and charities.

'Finally,
 without the relevant experience, people may often be unable to properly
 and thoroughly assess all of the assets and debts of the deceased - an 
issue in itself which makes it more likely that distribution of the 
estate will not be undertaken correctly.

'The
 consequences of getting such issues wrong can be serious and Personal 
Representatives are personally and financially liable for any mistakes 
they make.'
