Alfio Anthony Granata, 45, pleaded guilty on Monday to raping, assaulting and threatening a Dutch backpacker during a six-week ordeal

A Dutch backpacker was violently raped, beaten with a meat tenderiser and repeatedly bashed during a six week ordeal which ended with her attempting to take her own life. 

The woman was held captive in a Melbourne hotel room during 2012, during which time she was forced to sleep in the shower naked and ordered not to speak, or complain.

Alfio Anthony Granata, 45, pleaded guilty in the County Court of Victoria on Monday to raping, assaulting and threatening the backpacker on multiple occasions in a Preston’s Rydges Bell City hotel room where he and his partner Jennifer Mary Peaston lived, and his victim was held. 

Police attended the hotel room twice during the extended ordeal, but failed to rescue the fearful victim, the Herald Sun reported. 

The court heard the backpacker met Granata and his partner at a mutual friend's birthday party in St Kilda in November 2012.

The three soon became friends and began a consensual sexual relationship.

After using copious amounts of the drug ice, Granata became violent - and paranoid that his girlfriend and the victim were conspiring to run away together.

The court was also told backpacker was held captive and suffered daily beatings and numerous violent rapes over six weeks.

The saga ended on Christmas Day, 2012, when the woman fought back, stabbing Granata in the shoulder and threatening self harm.

The Victorian Country Court heard the backpacker met Granata and his partner at a mutual friend's birthday party in St Kilda in November 2012

Police were called and the extent of her abuse was uncovered.

The first time police attended the hotel before the backpacker was rescued, the victim told police there had been an altercation but that she was okay.

The second time officers visited Granata's hotel room during the hostage period they did not enter the room, instead speaking to the man and his de facto partner Peaston in the hallway.  

Dressed in prison greens on Monday, Granata sat calmly in the dock, as a video played of his victim detailing how her kidnap and ongoing torture had affected her life.

'I still suffer panic attacks, I'm still afraid of people, I feel like I'm in a black hole,' she said.

The Dutch woman was held in a Preston’s Rydges Bell City hotel room which police visited twice during the time she was held hostage

'I am disgusted by the things you did to me, I think you are a sick person.'

The court also heard Granata told his victim he had killed 248 people, and threatened to take the lives of her parents, who live in Holland.

The Dutch woman was also reportedly punched in the face, burnt with a gas torch lighter and banished to the bathroom.

She was forced to sleep in the shower or on the wet floor naked, sometimes left there for days on end. 

The hearing continues.
