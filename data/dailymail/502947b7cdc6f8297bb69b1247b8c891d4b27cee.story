'Blue-eyed angel': Tahlia Raven suffered a rare and fatal reaction to the common childhood bug

Smiling and bright-eyed, little Tahlia Raven looks the picture of health. 

But shortly after this photo was taken, she died from a common childhood bug normally so benign that it goes completely unnoticed in a third of cases.

Just a day earlier Tahlia had been playing outside in the sunshine with her sister Annaliese, five, and there was nothing to suggest she was unwell.

The bug, commonly called the slapped cheek virus because of the bright red flush it can trigger on the face, is caught by more than half of children.

Tahlia’s rare reaction meant she became only the fourth child to die from the virus in the UK in the past eight years.

It was only following a post-mortem examination that the three-year-old was found to have had the bug, also known as  parvovirus.

The airborne virus is spread in the same way as cold or flu viruses and is most prevalent in six- to ten-year-olds.

After an inquest her grief-stricken mother, Karen Glover, spoke of her heartbreak at losing her ‘beautiful blue-eyed angel’.

She said: ‘She was healthy before this. I have been told it is very common in playschools and nurseries and we don’t know why it killed her.’

The inquest in Chelmsford, Essex, heard how Ms Glover found her daughter lifeless in bed on the morning of June 2 last year.

The post-mortem examination revealed no evidence of a range of serious conditions, including meningitis or pneumonia.

She may have had a minor heart defect, although it was unclear whether this would have affected Tahlia’s ability to fight the infection.

Dr Marion Malone, a specialist paediatric pathologist at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, told the hearing on Monday: ‘I have to consider all possible causes of sudden death in a previously well three-year-old child.

Expert opinion: Dr Marion Malone, a specialist paediatric pathologist at Great Ormond Street Hospital (pictured) in London, said that, on the balance of probability, the toddler died from parvovirus, or 'slapped cheek' bug

‘The only significant thing I did find was a very swollen brain and some inflammation of the wind pipe. I identified parvovirus from the heart and brain. It is very common in children and known as slapped cheek disease.

 ‘On the balance of probability, I put down the cause of death as parvovirus. This is very rare. I have not seen a case before which caused such swelling of the brain.’

Recording a verdict of death by natural causes, Essex coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray concluded: ‘Tahlia sadly died at home, a sudden and unexpected death of a little girl who seemed perfectly healthy. She clearly  was much-loved.’

Beloved: Symptoms of slapped cheek virus include a flu-like illness and the distinctive red rash on the face, which can spread to the limbs. Above, Tahlia is pictured with Annaliese (left) and at six months old (right)

Ms Glover, from Southend, added the inquest had given her ‘some closure’ as she accepted nothing could have been done to save her daughter. ‘If we had gone to the doctor all they would have given us would be Calpol,’ she said.

Symptoms of slapped cheek virus include a flu-like illness and the distinctive red rash on the face, which can spread to the limbs.

The only risk group is pregnant women as there is a risk of miscarriage. There is no vaccine, as the virus usually only lasts a few days.
