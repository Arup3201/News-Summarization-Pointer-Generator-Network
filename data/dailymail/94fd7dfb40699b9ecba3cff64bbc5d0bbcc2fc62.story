Joke: Myleene Klass has mocked parents at her daughter's school for soliciting donations towards children's birthday presents

It wouldn’t be the first time a child’s birthday party has led to a bust-up in the school playground.

But in this case it’s the parents who are at war – and one of them is broadcaster Myleene Klass.

She has angered fellow mothers by mocking emails two of them sent suggesting that other parents club together to buy their children birthday gifts, including a Kindle.

Her sarcastic response, in which she said she was going to collect money to buy her seven-year-old daughter Ava a unicorn for her birthday, led to a confrontation with one of the mothers at the £5,000-a-term school yesterday.

Problems began after 36-year-old Miss Klass, the former pop star turned Classic FM presenter, posted on social media two emails she had received ‘from some school mums’, after first changing the names.

The first email read: ‘Jane and Hannah would prefer a class birthday gift for their daughters this year. Sarah would like a Kindle and Lola a desk (very studious choices!) so if you would like to join in, please can I collect a suggested £10 from you before the party on February 9.

‘If you prefer to send £ via an envelope in your daughters [sic] school bag, marked for Jane/me that works too. I will pass on a voucher and card to each at the party. Thanx [sic] and no obligation of course.’

A second email from another parent who offers to collect the cash reiterates that £10 would be a ‘popular amount’ to contribute – meaning that the total value of the gifts would be at least £200 – but adds: ‘Feel free to give what you like or indeed, to give your own gift.’

Shortly after, Miss Klass published her stinging reply in which she said she was collecting ‘unicorn money’ towards a ‘real, live unicorn’ for Ava.

Warming to her theme, she added: ‘I’d like a Ferrari and Leonardo DiCaprio, so by all means, do feel obligated to contribute to this too.’

And making it clear she thought the original request was bad manners, she ended her retort by saying the money could be donated to a fictitious site – www.getwhatyoure-givenandendthismadness.com.

Mockery: Ms Klass posted the text of two emails she received from fellow parents, as well as her response

Miss Klass, who lives in North London, entitled her reply ‘Let’s put the fun back into Bdays!’ and shared it with her 459,200 followers on Twitter and 75,000 on Instagram.

Hours later, she was confronted in the playground as she picked up Ava from her school.

A fellow parent, whose daughter was one of the subjects of the email, called across the playground: ‘Why did you do it, Myleene? Why?’

Miss Klass called back: ‘If you’ve got a problem with it, talk to me in private.’

Other parents have written to the headteacher. One wrote: ‘It was a very distasteful and cheap shot.’ Another mother said: ‘She has belittled us so publicly. Lots of people have complained,’ while a third added: ‘She isn’t going to have any friends left.’

Mother: Ms Klass was making fun of parents whose children attend the same school as her daughter Ava

Gift-giving has become a big business in many top private schools as parents vie to curry favour with teachers.

Tatler magazine reported last year that some teachers had been given presents as lavish as £1,000 handbags, diamond necklaces and cases of vintage wine.

At one school, parents even offered teachers the chance to use their private jet.

A mother at a London prep school said that she was emotionally blackmailed into donating £90 - the minimum amount acceptable - to a fund for teachers' gifts.

Some schools have had to introduce new rules capping the value of presents teachers can accept - at Stowe, for example, staff must declare any gifts above £50.

One defended the arrangement over buying presents, saying: ‘It is to make it easier for parents so they don’t buy expensive presents that nobody wants. There is no obligation. Myleene has misunderstood the school’s community spirit.’

Others claimed that the emails were actually a year old.

On parenting website Mumsnet, opinion was divided. One wrote: ‘Well good on her for shaming these grabby idiots. It’s crass and rude to ask for money instead of a gift.’

Another posted: ‘One of the mums asked to do this at our school! I think it’s so rude!’

But others sided with the parents asking for money. One wrote: ‘What’s wrong with asking for contributions towards a larger present? It seems much more sensible than getting 30 presents which you have to find room for and may not be played with.’

A spokesman for Miss Klass, who also has a three-year-old daughter, Hero, declined to comment.
