One of the biggest quests in physics, the search for the enigmatic substance known as dark matter, has failed to provide answers.

The Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment, the world’s most advanced test to find this elusive material, yesterday completed its first 90-day run.

Located 4,580 feet (1,400 metres) beneath the ground at a former gold mine in South Dakota, LUX experiments have so far come back empty handed.

The Large Underground Xenon experiment, the world's most advanced test to find this elusive material, yesterday completed its first 90-day run without finding any dark matter

The researchers now plan to create a similar detector that is 1,000 more powerful next year.

Dark matter is thought to make up 27 per cent of the universe, but experiments have failed to confirm its presence.

It is considered crucial to theories explaining how the universe is expanding and how galaxies interact.

Scientists are fairly sure it exists, but they do not know what it looks like or where to find it.

The LUX detector is lined with white teflon to better gather faint signals of light that will be recorded by the photomultiplier tubes. Water - 70,000 gallons of it - provides further protection from background radiation

Dark matter accounts for most of the mass in the Universe - around 27 per cent.

It surrounds galaxies across the universe, and is invisible because it does not reflect light.

It cannot be seen directly with telescopes, but astronomers know it to be out there because of the gravitational effects it has on the matter we can see.

Galaxies, for example, could not rotate the way they do and hold their shape without the presence of dark matter, researchers say.

The European Space Agency says: 'Shine a torch in a completely dark room, and you will see only what the torch illuminates.

'That does not mean that the room around you does not exist.

'Similarly we know dark matter exists but have never observed it directly.'

Scientists are fairly sure it exists and 
is crucial to the universe, but they do not know what it looks like or 
where to find it.

Astronomers have only been able to theorise its existence through the gravitational effects it has on matter in the universe.

One way of testing for it is to use detectors deep underground, such as LUX, to try and detect the moment dark matter particles pass through the Earth.

Scientists hoped LUX’s location deep underground would trap dark matter, which would be revealed through weakly interacting massive particles, dubbed WIMPS.

Millions of these WIMPs are thought to be travelling through regular matter without us knowing it.

In both theory and practice, collisions between WIMPs and normal matter are rare and extremely difficult to detect.

This is because a constant rain of cosmic radiation from space can drown out the faint signals.

As well as being underground, LUX is further protected from background radiation from the surrounding rock by immersion in a tank of ultra-pure water.

At the heart of the experiment is a 
6-foot-tall titanium tank filled with almost a third of a tonne of 
liquid xenon, cooled to minus 150 degrees Fahrenheit.

If a WIMP strikes an atom of an element named xenon, it recoils from other xenon atoms and emits light and electrons.

The
 electrons are drawn upward by an electrical field and interact with a 
thin layer of xenon gas at the top of the tank, releasing more photons.

Lux is located 4,580 feet (1,400 meters) beneath the ground at a former gold mine in South Dakota

Photomultiplier tubes capable of detecting a single photon of light line the top and bottom of the LUX dark matter detector. They will record the position and intensity of collisions between dark matter particles and xenon nuclei

Light detectors in the top and bottom of the tank are each capable of detecting a single photon.

The locations of the two photon signals – one at the collision point, the other at the top of the tank – can be pinpointed to within a few millimeters.

The energy of the interaction can be precisely measured from the brightness of the signals.

So far, however, that hasn't happened.

The team said that this absence also ruled out the possibility that other detectors had seen glimpses of dark matter.

‘This is only the beginning for LUX’, said physicist Dan McKinsey of Yale University.

‘Now that we understand the instrument and its backgrounds, we will continue to take data, testing for more and more elusive candidates for dark matter.’

Planning for the next-generation dark matter experiment at the Sanford Lab already is under way.

Compared to LUX’s third of a tonne of liquid xenon, the LUX-ZEPLIN, or LZ, experiment would have a seven tonne liquid xenon target inside the same 72,000-gallon tank of pure water used by LUX.

‘LZ will be a thousand times more sensitive than the LUX detector,” said Tom Shutt, the spokesman for LZ.

‘It will just begin to see an irreducible background of neutrinos that may ultimately set the limit to our ability to measure dark matter.’

1 - As well as being underground, LUX is 
further protected from background radiation from the surrounding rock by
 immersion in a tank of ultra-pure water.

2 - Closed loop of liquid nitrogen condensation/evaporation provides 1 kW cooling power to the detector.

3 - At the heart of the experiment is a 
6-foot-tall titanium tank filled with almost a third of a tonne of 
liquid xenon, cooled to minus 150 degrees Fahrenheit.

4 - If a WIMP strikes a xenon atom it recoils from other xenon atoms and emits light and electrons.

5 - The
 electrons are drawn upward by an electrical field and interact with a 
thin layer of xenon gas at the top of the tank, releasing more photons.Light detectors in the top and bottom of the tank are each capable of detecting a single photon

6 - The internal supporting frame is composed of two PMT copper holder plates and titanium straps. The energy of the interaction can be precisely measured from the brightness of the signals.
