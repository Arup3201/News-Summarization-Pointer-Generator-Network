A child pageant queen with a form of dwarfism has emerged as an adorable new star of Toddlers & Tiaras.

Lacey-Mae, from Brooklyn, Connecticut, has achondroplasia, which means that though she is eight years old, she is only as tall as a three or four-year-old.

She is seen competing among children of her own age group though, and more than holds her own in a Bollywood-inspired dance routine.

Child star: Lacey-Mae, an eight-year-old dwarf, has become the new star of TLC's Toddlers & Tiaras. She was shown dancing a Bollywood-inspired routine during a pageant featured on last night's episode

Passion: Unlike other children featured in reality show, it is Lacey-Mae's enthusiasm, rather than her mother's (right) that drives her involvement on the pageant circuit

Her mother, Kerry Ann, says performing on the pageant circuit has done wonders for her daughter's self-esteem.

'It doesn't matter if she's three feet tall or six feet tall, her personality rules the stage,' she tells the cameras.

In fact, Lacey-Mae is so bursting with enthusiasm and energy, Kerry Ann even goes as far as to call her a diva.

She explained how Lacey-Mae was first entered into a pageant because so many people had commented on her looks.

Supportive: Kerry Ann, her mother, says that entering the youngster into pageants help to boost her confidence

Champion: Lacey-Mae got into pageants after people kept stopping her mother to tell her how cute she was

'We decided to enter Lacey-Mae into her first pageant because people used to stop us and tell us how cute she was,' she said.

'Didn't figure that she would turn into the little pageant diva that she turned out to be.'

Unlike many of the children featured in the hit TLC show, it is Lacey-Mae's enthusiasm - rather than her mother's - that drives her involvement on the pageant circuit.

Kerry Ann is ready to acknowledge this, adding: 'Pageants can have a bad reputation. Some people wonder, why do you put your kids in them? This is very special for her, its for her self esteem.'

Some of the more extreme grooming requirements for 'Glitz' pageant contestants leave Kerry Ann with some concerns.

Before and after: With a face full of make-up and curled locks, she looks just like any other pageant star

Challenging: Due to her size, it is hard for Lacey-Mae to be fitted in traditional pageant frock sizes

Both are seen looking apprehensive as they contemplate false eyelashes.

Kerry Ann tells producers: 'This is the first time we will be trying to put fake eyelashes on Lacey. I know she’s a little nervous about it’

Echoing her mother, Lacey-Mae asks: 'If it gets stuck what are we going to do?’

Luckily they make it through without any mishaps, but it's not the only challenge they face. Costumes, too can prove tricky given Lacey-Mae's size.

'It's hard because of Lacey’s size, to do a lot of adjustments,' Kerry Ann explains. 'I usually wind up cutting off probably half of the sleeve in order to fit her arm correctly.

'These dresses are very very heavy for her because her legs are so small and her torso is average-sized so I have to go in and put in some more gel pads to hopefully take off the weight of the dress for Lacey.'

Pain: Typical pageant frocks are too heavy for Lacey-Mae, shown above struggling under the weight of one, so her mother is forced to adjust each of them before she performs

The episode shows how Lacey-Mae's size does attract some attention from other contestants and their parents, who don't understand that she is competing in the correct age group.

One mother is seen pointing at Lacey-Mae as she asks her own eight-year-old: 'She’s in your group?'

It is the judges who Lacey-Mae cares about impressing, though, and she does.

After the youngster's beauty performance, Lindsay Rogers, one of the All Around The World pageant judge, says: 'I think Lacey-Mae is amazing, I think the one thing I would critique would be just to shorten the dress because it was too long.'

It seems Lacey-Mae is not immune to post-show tantrums, just like any of her fellow pageant contestants.

A scarf used during her Bollywood performance gets caught on her head as she attempts to twirl it around her.

Upset: She feels disheartened by one of her performances which causes her to sulk once she's off stage

Post-show tears: Lacey-Mae is consoled by her mother who assures her that she did a 'fine' job on stage

She is seen crying once she has left the stage.

She tells Kerry Ann: 'I'm not going to win and you know I'm not. I did horrible.'

The mother assures her she did 'fine' before telling the camera that her daughter had 'felt insecure' during the performance.

At the end of the day, the judges confirm that Lacey-Mae is a pageant star regardless of the slight hiccup.

Crowned: Lacey-Mae is awarded a prize for scoring the best overall score for her pageant outfits

Star quality: Her mother says she looks forward to seeing what the youngster achieves next in the world of pageantry

She is awarded the Overall Best Outfit Of Choice award, which includes an unspecified amount of cash as well as a tiara, naturally.

Kerry Ann says: 'We would've never thought that back when Lacey was a littlebaby that she would be where she is today.

'I can't wait to see what the futurebrings for Lacey-Mae and what she will do next.'
