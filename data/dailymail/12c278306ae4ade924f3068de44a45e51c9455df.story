The married high school teacher and mother-of-three was sentenced today to five years behind bars after a jury found her guilty of having sex with five male students, four of whom she had group sex with while being videotaped.

It came after her husband pleaded with the judge for leniency in her sentencing and vowed to stand by his wife after he revealed they liked to have legal group sex as a couple.

A jury took less than an hour to find Brittni Colleps guilty today of the sex crimes after they were shown a video of the orgy  with her students in court.

Her husband Christopher Colleps told the court he is working on forgiving his wife and admitted that, though they had engaged in group sex together before, he felt wronged by her actions with the students.

He said: 'I'm asking you to give her probation. 
It's not my fault or her children's, and taking her away from us is 
punishing us. Brittni saved my life before I met her. I was 
doing bad things and when I met Brittni she gave me someone to love and 
care about.'

Mr Colleps is a 
soldier stationed at Louisiana’s Fort Polk. He is believed to have been 
overseas on duty with the U.S. military at the time and their children 
were also not at the home.

The court heard this week that as 
well as taking part in the sex tape, Colleps would model lingerie for 
them and sent them videos of her using sex toys.

The
 married mother-of-three, met the students while she worked at Kennedale
 High School in Texas as an English teacher and repeatedly invited them 
to her home for sex.

The jury took less than an hour to find her guilty on five counts of having an inappropriate relationship between a student and teacher.

Her mother also testified during the sentencing hearing to ask the judge to show some mercy.

Shirley Bush said: 'Have mercy on her as someone who has 
done nothing wrong except in that time period. Have mercy on her kids 
they don't understand this.

'She's a generous person. When I went through
 cancer she was seven months pregnant and she shaved her head. She is a 
loving daughter, a loving wife regardless what happened in this 
situation.'

Christopher Colleps said the couple's
 children had been staying with his sister for the past week. The couple
 told their children that their mother "did bad things and might need to
 go away."

'Anything goes kind of girl': Colleps allegedly modelled lingerie for the teenagers and showed them sex toys

Emotional: Colleps appears at a press conference where he husband said he was standing by her

The students, who used 
pseudonyms, all testified against the 28-year-old former teacher - but 
claimed they had initially hid the relationship because they 'didn't 
want her to 
get into trouble'.

Although all of the students she had sex with are 18 or older, the law protects students from a relationship 
with someone in a superior position.

The
 teenagers said she contacted them through text messages - with one 
saying she texted him 100 times in a day - or by 'poking' them on 
Facebook.

On Thursday, one student, John, said he had been to the teacher's home with friends 
and on his own and had sex with her.

He told the court that on one occasion, Colleps cooked the students spaghetti, showed them sex toys and then modelled lingerie, the Star-Telegram reported.

The group then went to the back yard 
where they played a game of truth and dare and one of the boys 
was dared to have sex with the teacher. They went to her bedroom, where they had sex.

John added that the group had agreed 
to 'keep it on the low' so Colleps would not get in trouble, and added 
that he did not want to testify against her, and did not consider 
himself a victim.

When he was asked what should happen to her, he responded: 'I wouldn't say jail time.'

Another student, Jordan,
 said he learned from friends that the teacher was having sex with 
students and he 'just was amazed,' he told the court.

He went to her house twice, where he engaged in group sex, he said. He added that he recorded the last encounter using one of the other boys' phones.

The video, which was shown to the court on Tuesday, showed Colleps having sex with the boys; although her back is to the camera, she is identifiable by a neck tattoo, they said.

Colleps looked away from the screen and appeared uncomfortable when it was shown.

Prosecutor
Elizabeth Beach told the court: 'One of the boys, as will happen with 
high school seniors, had his cellphone with him. And decided that this would be a good thing to get a 
clip of.'

In court: The teenagers testified this week and said they did not want Colleps to get in trouble

Scene: She met them at Kennedale High School, where she taught English, and began contacting them outside school - texting one 100 times a day or 'poking' them through Facebook

But when school officials asked him about the romp in May 2011, he denied it because 'I didn't want to get her in trouble,' he said. 'I was trying to save her.'

Another student said on Thursday that he had never texted Colleps but had visited her Arlington home with friends, where she performed oral sex on him twice.

The teenager, using the name Richard, said he was 'happy' to be at the home.

Another student said he exchanged more than one hundred messages with her in the one day.

He said: 'She said that she craved… that I had 
something that she wanted.'

Colleps discussed the number of her sexual partners - eight guys, two 
girls - her favourite sex toys and described herself as an 'anything goes
 in sex kind of girl', according to the student.

He said he had sex with Colleps five times, four of which involved more than one student.

Another student testified that after a series of texts from Colleps, she picked him up near his house and drove him to her home, where 
they had sex two days in a row.

It came after he 'poked' her on Facebook and she poked him back.

Though
 she initially said she could not send them any pictures for fear she 
would be jailed, two students said she later texted nude pictures of 
herself as well as a video of her using a sex toy.

Colleps broke down as her attorney Lex Johnston asked if the state had ever offered her a plea bargain. If found guilty, she could serve a maximum of 20 years behind bars.

She responded they had not and began weeping as she said she never wanted the case to go to trial or have her former students testify against her. The teenagers agreed they did not want to.

'I want you to know I love my wife,' he said on Thursday. 'I have loved my wife since the moment I laid eyes on her over 11 years ago. I will continue to support my wife through this whole, entire ordeal.'
