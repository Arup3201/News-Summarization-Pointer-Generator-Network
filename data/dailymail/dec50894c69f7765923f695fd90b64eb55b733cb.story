The University of Cambridge has defended a law exam described as 'horrific' by students because of its graphic depictions of oral sex, male rape and naked torture.

The university's renowned law faculty has used real-life scenarios for exams in the past, but many students were left shocked by its latest test questions.

Around 200 students sitting the exam on Saturday morning were presented with a scenario involving a fictional college drinking society's initiation ceremony which went on to describe several indecent assaults.

The question in the three-hour exam at the university's Faculty of Law began: 'Sandra is President of The Vizards, a College drinking society. She is organising the initiation of new members.

'After a great deal of alcohol has been drunk, the members of the society form a circle around Billy, Gilbert and Richard who are to be initiated.'

The question then described three rituals in which a male student was blindfolded and given oral sex by another man, another was sexually assaulted with a bottle and a third had his pubic hair shaved off before dying from a subsequent infection.

The students were asked to outline any offences which may have been committed during the scenario.

After the exam students took to social networking sites with one describing it as 'horrific' and 'beyond acceptable'.

@mirandajulietp tweeted: 'That's a horrific question - so far beyond acceptable and a total misrepresentation of most socs, actually'.

Online student newspaper The Tab said the reaction from the student body had 'varied from incredulity to mild amusement'.

Shock: Many students took to Twitter to express their views on the 'far beyond acceptable' questions posed in a recent law exam

Sebastian Salek, a third year law 
student at Clare College, told the website: 'It was surprising to see the university
directly reference drinking societies and particularly initiations, 
which they generally tend to turn a blind eye to.'

But The Tab added that other students felt that the question demonstrated that the university is keeping up with the times, with one fresher from Trinity quoted as saying: 'Drinking socs are, after all, a big part of life at Cambridge.'

Luke Martin-Fuller, who sat the exam, told the Daily Telegraph that no-one in the examination hall had reacted when they first read the paper.

He said: 'Nobody batted an eyelid, nobody sniggered or looked up or glanced at anyone – you just got on with it.

'I can see why it might look a bit funny. I can understand why people might think that's a bit risqué.'

The Faculty of Law has previously used graphic scenarios in its papers with one exam, which was posted online last year,  presenting a similar question about a 
drinking society initiation ceremony which involved running naked through
Cambridge while being beaten with stinging nettles.

A University of Cambridge spokesman confirmed the incident, saying: 'In the Part One Criminal Law examination paper set by the University of Cambridge Law Faculty, hypothetical situations are presented in order to test students' understanding of different aspects of Criminal Law.'
