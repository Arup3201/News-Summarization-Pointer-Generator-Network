Guilty: Music teacher Tracy Frankcom admitted telling police that she was the victim of three armed robberies - when in fact she had launched the knife attacks on herself

A piano teacher’s reputation lay in ruins yesterday after she was unmasked as a hoaxer who triggered a massive police manhunt by falsely claiming she was being stalked by a crazed 'psycho slasher'.

Tracy Frankcom, 41, mutilated her own hands with a kitchen knife and slapped herself in the face - then wrongly alleged her injuries were caused by a sinister assailant who attacked her three times in 12 weeks at her music shop and farmhouse home.

Frankcom also sent herself poison pen text messages and abusive Christmas cards reading: 'It’s your last b****' and 'You’re dead b****' and helped officers create an e-fit of the fictitious assailant.

Frankcom’s husband Martin, also a 
musician, was so worried about the terror campaign he went onto the 
internet and bought his wife a stab-proof vest and a stun gun for 
protection.

Lancashire 
Police staged a major operation to track down the stalker, gave Frankcom
police protection when she left work, and referred their inquiries onto
murder squad detectives. They even scrambled the force helicopter to 
search for suspects.

Police eventually arrested an innocent 
man, held him for 18 hours and forced him to take part in an ID parade 
before releasing him without charge.

Officers finally became suspicious of
Frankcom’s account when inquiries drew a blank and she later confessed 
she had made it up - claiming she was 'in a dark place' following a 
minor bust up with a customer at her sheet music store in Darwen, 
Lancashire.

She claimed she was due to carry out a 
fourth and fatal attack upon herself. The self-mutilation damaged the 
tendons in Frankcom's left thumb, and may affect her piano playing for 
the rest of her life.

The bill for the police operation came to £10,000 in total.

Frankcom broke down and wept at Preston Crown Court as she admitted three charges of perverting the course of justice.

She was ordered to pay police £5,000 
pounds compensation for the wasted man-hours, and will have to pay £1,500
prosecution costs.

She was also ordered to complete a three year community order during which she will seek help for her problems.

Judge Andrew Woolman told Frankcom: 'You are an educated woman, hardworking and a talented music teacher.

'There’s no explanation why a woman of 
41 years old should embark on such a series of lies and exaggerations 
with serious consequences to you and everyone else.

'It is a bizarre case, one of the most 
bizarre cases I’ve come across as a judge, and it does not fall into the
normal categories. Usually the case is that is made against a named 
individual to false rape or the like and if a person lies like this they
go to prison.

'But I think there is some deep-seated problem in your character that caused you to behave like this. No good would come of imprisoning you and it might well be enough to stop you again given people will now know the lengths you went to.'

Frankcom, who also teaches violin and guitar, spent years building up her music career.

According to her website she was approached by Yamaha UK to act as a demonstrator for their keyboards, and she played alongside husband Martin in a Jean Michel Jarre tribute band called JarreLook.

The pair later set up their own music school together.

The court heard how the police investigation began in October 2010 when Frankcom claimed she was attacked outside her Arietta Music shop in Rossendale, Lancashire.

She claimed she had been moving musical instruments into the shop when she was grabbed by the neck and 'slashed' with a knife during a scuffle with two men who tried to rob her.

Mr Bob Sastry, prosecuting, said she had a 3cm wound on her forearm and was said to be 'visibly upset'.

Complete fiction: Frankcom helped Lancashire Police compile an e-fit of her non-existent attacker, and appealed to the public for help in catching the 'psychopath'

As well as handing in a blood-stained top and black headband to the police, she compiled an e-fit of one of her assailants and asked police to issue the picture and make a public appeal for information.

The following month, Frankcom claimed she was by her vehicle in a car park when an Asian man stabbed and tried to rob her, saying, 'No f..king white bitch is going to humiliate me.'

Mr Sastry said: 'She was taken in the ambulance to the hospital and photos were taken in relation to the injury. Two wounds were inflicted. The tendons on her left thumb were severed and a further operation was performed.'

He added: 'The defendant had gone to Argos and bought a pay as you go mobile telephone, but police discovered that the phone had only been used to contact the defendant herself.

'She claimed she had silent phone calls and another Christmas card saying 'You’re dead b****'. Police fully investigated the complaints.'

The following January Frankcom reported a third attack at her home, saying that while she was putting the bins out a man had put a rope around her neck and slashed her with a knife.

She claimed she had shot him with the stun gun and that she was also wearing the stab vest she had purchased.

She had bruises to the right side of her face and a three inch deep wound which required seven stitches at hospital.

At the time of the attacks Frankcom, who has been teaching piano, keyboard, guitar and violin for 11 years, claimed she was afraid to be in the shop alone after dark and gave an interview to her local newspaper about her ordeal.

Police later arrested an Asian man in Bolton in relation to the alleged offences, and he was on bail for three days before officers told him no further action would be taken.

Frankcom was arrested in March last year after police began to suspect the robberies had not actually happened.

Scene of the invented crime: The police investigation began in October 2010 when Frankcom claimed she had been attacked with a knife outside her Arietta Music shop in Darwen

Mr Sastry said: 'Because of the continued nature of the attacks police went down to try to safeguard the local area and the investigation cost police resources £10,000.

'Officers thought she had a potential stalker, and a considerable area of the community was affected. The allegations involved a racist element, police were very careful to investigate and it didn’t help race relations in the area.

'A police helicopter was sent out as well as dog patrols and the police had to ensure officers were present when she left work. Police had to refer the incident to the major incident team.'

Frankcom initially denied any wrongdoing before breaking down and confessing to fabricating her ordeal. She also admitted illegal possession of the stun gun.

In mitigation, defence lawyer James Heywood handed in testimonials from her pupils and husband, who is believed to be standing by her.

Mr Heywood said: 'This was a bizarre series of actions. It was out of character for Tracy Frankcom. She is a hard worker trying to make a success of two businesses, she is educated a talented musician trying to bring out the best in youngsters.

'What occurred and her behaviour was more than attention-seeking. She was in a dark place - there is no psychiatric explanation, but there was a trigger. And the response to this trigger led to unforeseeable enactment, almost an acting out of a series of attacks, playing both the victim and the attacker.

'By the time the police got involved seeing her as a suspect she had planned a final attack, and she would have taken her own life. Even to this day she can’t explain these bizarre attacks.'

After the case Det Insp Mark Winstanley of Lancashire Police said: 'Frankcom falsely claimed she was a victim of three very serious offences and we put a significant amount of resources into investigating her claims.

'This was a significant drain on police resources and whilst we would always urge all genuine victims to come forward and report incidents to the police, anyone making malicious claims will be dealt with robustly and brought to justice.'
