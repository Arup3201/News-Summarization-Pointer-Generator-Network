More children can identify Simon Cowell than an avacado, new figures reveal.

While 80 per cent of children could instantly recognise the X Factor judge, only 62 per cent were able to name the avocado when shown a picture of the vegetable.

The research, which polled six to 10-year-olds found famous faces were more familiar to children than the avocado.

More children could identify Simon Cowell, left, than an avocado. Only 62 per cent of those survey correctly recognised the vegetable while 80 per cent knew who the X Factor judge was.

According to the poll, which surveyed 500 children, 85 per cent correctly identified David Beckham, with 72 per cent also recognising Prince William from a picture and 70 per cent correctly identifying prime minister David Cameron.

But when it came to the avocado, just 62 per cent knew what it was, while the other children said they didn't know or mistook it for another fruit or vegetable.

This compares to other fresh food, with 93 per cent correctly identifying a picture of a cucumber and 95 per cent knowing what an apple was.

David Beckham, left was more recognisable than the avocado with 85 per cent of children correctly identifying him. Prince William, right was also identified by 72 per cent of children

But when it came to trying different fruits and vegetables, more than half had not tasted an avocado and 68 per cent had never tried kale.

However, other vegetables were more widely known, with only 15 per cent saying they had not tasted cabbage, nine per cent having never tried broccoli and one in ten saying they had not tried onions.

The research released today was commissioned by Alton Towers Resort and carried out by One Poll.

When asked, 70 per cent of children could identify David Cameron, left, while 88 per cent knew that they lived on planet Earth

And when it came to identifying different shapes, children fared a lot better with 90 per cent knowing a square had four sides, and 96 per cent identifying a triangle.

However, showing a gap in their knowledge, only 88 per cent realised they lived on planet Earth, with some believing they lived on Saturn or Mars.

Meanwhile, only 64 per cent of children correctly recognised the National Anthem.

The research comes as CBeebies Land at Alton Towers Resort prepares to open its gates for the first time on May 24.

Children fared better when identifying shapes with 90 per cent of them knowing a square has four sides. And even more children, 93 per cent were able to correctly identify a picture of a cucumber

Mat Way, BBC Worldwide's commercial director, Live Events, said: 'We've found that children learn best when they're interacting and CBeebies Land will continue to encourage learning through play.

'By giving children the chance to discover things for themselves, we can help improve their development while they're having fun.'

Katherine Duckworth, from Alton Towers Resort, added: 'We're really excited about the launch of CBeebies Land and can't wait to see the children having fun with the different characters.

'While this poll shows that some older children have some gaps in their general knowledge, CBeebies Land is a place where children can come and enjoy themselves but also learn a little more about the world around them.'
