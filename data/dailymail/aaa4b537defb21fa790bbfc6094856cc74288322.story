Massachusetts health officials have confirmed the state's first case this year of a person infected with a potentially fatal virus via mosquito bite.

Eastern Equine Encephalitis - or triple E - can cause inflammation of the brain and death in a third of all cases.

The state's Department of Health confirmed that a July 15th lab test in Plymouth County returned a positive result for EEE, WWLP reports.

Eastern Equine Encephalitis is often carried by birds, who are then bitten by moquitoes who in turn then pass the virus on to humans. Though the virus cannot be passed from human to human and is rarely fatal, it can cause fever, severe joint pain, swelling, rashes, and a feeling 
similar to arthritis for years. In extreme cases, it can cause inflammation of the brain leading to death.

infection along to humans. 

'Mosquitoes are an unusual insect because bacteria can survive in its 
gut and then it can be regurgitated or come out in its saliva when it 
bites, and that’s how you get transmission,' said Entomologist Bob Russell.

The 
disease is rarely fatal, and is often more of a discomfort. It cannot be transmitted directly from human to 
human.

News of this new infection surfaces only days after two cases were reported in Florida.

State health officials confirmed a Miami-Dade County female and a male in Palm Beach County have become the first two people to contract chikungya in the United States.

Dozens of infections have previously been reported in Florida alone, according to the Tampa Bay Times, but these are the first two to have been contracted in the States.

Not contagious among humans: Chikungunya is transmitted through mosquito bites

The Miami-Dade woman, 41. started complaining of symptoms June 10, according to the Miami Herald, and the 50-year-old male from Palm Beach County first reported his symptoms on July 1.

Neither had travelled outside the country, sources told the Herald.

Previous cases of the disease were the result of travelers having been bitten by infected mosquitoes in the Caribbean, where it is highly-prevalent. It was only a matter of time until it made the jump to Florida.

‘We expected this. Now the question is what are the cases to follow and can Mosquito Control itself do something to mitigate whatever those numbers might be?’ Walter Tabachnick, director of the University of Florida's Florida Medical Entomology Laboratory, told the Herald.

‘It’s not clear yet, how many more cases are there to follow in addition to these initial cases,’ he explained

Another official told the paper counties will now be spraying more often for mosquitoes.

‘We’re trying to put in our plan on how to be a little more proactive with our spraying,’ Miami-Dade County’s Road, Bridge, Canal and Mosquito Control Division chief Manuel Garcia said.

‘We don’t want to set a concrete plan; we have to come up with an adjustable plan based on the mosquitoes, and adjust the plan routinely.’

Authorities expect more people who became sick from an infected mosquito to eventually come forward, but do not expect a full-on outbreak or epidemic like it has become in some parts of the Caribbean.

Reports say thousands of cases have been reported in the Dominican Republic. It has been declared an epidemic in Puerto Rico, where 121 cases have been confirmed, according to the Centers for Disease Control.

Property owners in Florida are being encouraged to drain standing water, seal screens and windows, and cover up while outside since the infected insects can bite during both the day and night.

The only treatment for chikungunya is acetaminophen and water. Taking aspirin is specifically discouraged because the disease does not react well to it.
