Authorities were alerted last week that a 15-year-old male student had an inappropriate video from a female teacher.

Detectives say two boys at the school had received videos and pictures of the teacher. She became close with them while they were students at Burns Middle School two years ago.

Police said that Blanton shared 
ordinary pictures which then became snaps of her in a bathing suit then 
finally of her performing lewd acts, according to wsoctv.com.

None of the videos were recorded on school property. Sheriff Alan Norman says there is no indication of a sexual relationship with students.

The 34-year-old did not show up for a court appearance today but was represented by her attorney.

Ms Blanton, who is not married according to public records, was released from jail on a $150,000 bond on Tuesday.

Blanton, 34, is a former teacher at Burns Middle School in Lawndale, North Carolina. The two boys that she sent the videos too are former students
