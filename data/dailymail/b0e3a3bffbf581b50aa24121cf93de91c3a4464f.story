The luck of the 'Fab Five' appears to be running out as U.S. gymnast Gabby Douglas failed to come up with a medal in her top event - the uneven bars - where she finished last.

America's new sweetheart, who won the all-around gold in a stunning performance last week, was the final gymnast to attempt her routine.

She stalled in the middle of it, and took a step on the landing.

Admittedly fatigued at this stage of the Summer Games, Douglas said she would rest before her last day of competition in the balance beam tomorrow at the 02 Arena.

Douglas told USA Today: 'It was an amazing talent of finalists. Coming into bar finals was a big challenge for me. I made a little mistake, but I'm human and when you get towards the end of the Olympics you get drained and tired.'

She vowed to 'finish strong' in the beam competition, which takes place tomorrow.

Russia's Aliya Mustafina came away with the gold medal, just 18 months after blowing out her knee and putting her chances for London in doubt.

Mustafina couldn’t take her eyes off the scoreboard after the final results were posted, staring at it with pride.

Beth Tweddle, the inspiration for Great Britain’s gymnastics renaissance, won bronze, while He Kexin of China took silver.

Douglas' performance came on the day after teammate McKayla 
Maroney missed out on the Olympic gold medal after falling on her second attempt in the women's vault finals.

With a score of 15.191, Sandra Izbasa from Romania beat Maroney, who was a heavy favourite to win after coming first in last year's world championships.

It was the second career gold medal for Izbasa and a devastating shock for Maroney, who had also posted the highest qualifying score in London.

After an almost flawless first attempt, the 16-year-old landed her second vault on her heels and her legs quickly skidded out from under her as a look of shock crossed her face.

Disappointed: Maroney was honest about her feelings, saying she was disappointed but happy with her silver medal

The crowd gasped as she plopped 
to the mat, and her score of 14.3 gave her an average of 15.083.

The world champion's rare mistake opened the door for Izbasa, who won the floor exercise at the Beijing Olympics, and she took advantage of it.

In an instant, the Olympic gold medal that everyone was certain had Maroney's name on it was gone.

Maroney claimed the silver medal and looked extremely unimpressed as she stood on the podium next to a beaming Izbasa and Maria Paseka of Russia, who won the bronze.

She took to her Twitter page to tell of 
her frustration. 'Disappointed on how today turned out, but everything 
happens for a reason!! #no regrets.. Plus, the silver medal is actually 
pretty sick,' she Tweeted.

Had Maroney not fallen, she would have easily won gold because of the degree of difficulty in her vault.

Maroney was attempting a move called the Amanar when her dreams of a gold medal collapsed.

The
Amanar is one of the toughest manouveres in the sport and 
comprises a roundoff onto the takeoff board, followed by a back 
handspring onto the vault and then 2.5 twists in the air before landing.

Her
first attempt went according to plan. She got great height off the 
table and her form was perfect in the air, with legs pencil-straight, 
and her body tightly coiled.

Fall: Maroney, pictured, was a strong favourite to win but fell on her second attempt

She took a hop on her landing, and came down out of bounds. But even with that 0.3 deduction, she still scored 15.866, including a whopping 9.666 for execution.

Another vault like that, and the gold was hers.

But she appeared to land the second one on the back of her heels. Her feet slid forward and she dropped to the mat.

The crowd gasped, and Maroney, who rarely makes errors in training or in competition, was stunned.

Maroney
was considered all but a lock for the gold medal, which would have 
given the U.S. women three in the first three gymnastics events.

She won her world title last year by almost a half-point, and topped qualifying here by a similar margin.

Her devastating defeat came just five days after she helped Team USA team win gold.

Maroney received a 16.233 on vault, the highest score in the competition - and all with a fracture in her big right toe.

'McKayla Maroney's was an absolute 
moonshot,' U.S. coach John Geddert said afterwards. 'They should rename 
the vault. They should call it the 'Maroney' because it's a different 
league.

'She does it so much higher and faster and cleaner and more dynamic than the normal human.'
