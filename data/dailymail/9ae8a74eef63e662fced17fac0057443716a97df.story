Guy Praisler has been hailed a hero after he took over control of a bus after the driver passed out behind the wheel

A passenger has been hailed a hero after he took over control of a bus after the driver passed out behind the wheel.

Guy Praisler managed to avert a disaster on the Upper East Side of New York when a Bronx-bound bus careered out of control.

The 45 year old managed to take charge of the vehicle but not before it caused mayhem on the busy avenue - hitting several cars, a parking meter and a school fence.

The driver lost consciousness while going north on Madison Avenue near East 81st at around 7pm.

Mr Praisler, of Riverdale, said people began screaming as the bus began to hit cars when he realised something was wrong with the driver. 

The bus — with 18 aboard — was going between 25 to 30 mph hour when driver Kevin Prendergast, who had been driving for 30 years, slumped over the wheel.

The quick thinking commuter managed to ease the unconscious driver’s foot off the accelerator and bring the bus to a halt at around 85th street.Mr Praisler told the New York Post he was not trying to be a hero - he was just 'trying to stop the bus'.

'After we stopped, he regained his conscious and started asking what happened.'

'I just feel bad for the driver. He’s a really nice guy.'

Six people were injured, including the driver, three of his passengers, another driver and a cab passenger.

Four of the people were taken to a nearby hospital with minor injuries. Three were released last night.

The driver was also taken to hospital, but officials would not describe his condition or say why he might have passed out.

An source said Prendergast got dizzy before blacking out.
