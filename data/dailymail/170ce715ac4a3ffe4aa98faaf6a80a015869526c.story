COMMENTARY by By
Tom Bower

Born in 
comparative poverty in East London, he became one of Britain's richest 
tycoons by transforming Formula One from a sport for car enthusiasts 
into a global brand producing profits of more than £1billion a year.

During that journey, he has learnt to duck and dive as he pocketed at least £2.5billion for himself.For
 a man who left school at 15 to trade motorbike parts while employed by 
the Gas Board, and who honed his skills by haggling over the prices of 
used cars with criminals, the fruits of his wealth have been sweet.

They
 include a large yacht, racehorses, fabulous houses across London and in
 Switzerland, a private jet and even his own airport in Biggin Hill.

Bribe charge: Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone stands between his lawyers as he arrives in the regional court in in Munich, Germany

With
 typical swagger, Ecclestone always pays in cash, often peeling off 
500-euro notes from a wad. Indeed, he has been known to carry $1million 
(£600,000) in cash in a plastic bag – and then leave the bag in a room 
by mistake. With his vast fortune, $1million is petty cash.

Of
 course, it should be no surprise that someone who has amassed such 
wealth should come under intense public scrutiny – he is currently 
accused in a German court of paying a £27million bribe to a banker to 
secure the sale of a stake in Formula One to a company he favoured. Now 
he faces Panorama's allegations of a secret agreement to avoid £1billion
 in taxes.

For
 his part, Ecclestone, an inveterate gambler, is unfazed. Last night he 
told me: 'Everything about my taxes is clear and straight, yet everyone 
is looking for a mystery. It's not there.'

In the tycoon's view, Panorama is sensationalising an ordinary and legal arrangement.

Others, of course, may see  matters differently.

The
 story behind the BBC team's allegation started in 1996, when 
Ecclestone, then 66, was trying to raise £1billion by selling part of 
his Formula One empire.

During
 the negotiations, lawyers told him that his then wife, Slavica Malic, a
 statuesque Croatian model he met during the Italian Grand Prix in 
Monza, couldn't inherit his fortune without paying inheritance taxes 
because she was not domiciled in Britain.

Life of luxury: Bernie Ecclestone's yacht, Sea Force One

So,
 to avoid his family losing nearly half his fortune on his death, 
Ecclestone legally transferred his wealth to a trust in Switzerland 
which would be completely controlled by his wife for the benefit of 
herself and their two daughters. To guarantee that no inheritance taxes 
could be claimed by the Inland Revenue, Ecclestone would have no control
 over the trust.

Also, for the tax avoidance to be watertight, he had to live for another seven years.

The
 scheme nearly collapsed in 1999 when he required heart surgery. He 
survived but there was another hitch in 2008: Slavica decided to file 
for a divorce.

Suddenly, Ecclestone faced a major dilemma.

His
 lawyers advised that he could claim 50 per cent of the Swiss trusts 
from Slavica but that would ruin the perfect tax protection plan he had 
created. So instead, he asked Slavica to pay him what she thought 
'fair'. Slavica duly agreed to give her ex-husband £60 million a year 
for ten years.

That
 crisis may have been overcome but it also coincided with an inquiry by 
the Inland Revenue into Ecclestone's private use of his company's cars, 
plane and homes.

It is believed that Slavica Ecclestone, right, has paid £300 million to her ex-husband Bernie, right, since their 2009 divorce

In
 the Revenue's opinion, Ecclestone should have paid more tax on the 
benefits. In due course, both sides agreed to settle for a payment of 
£10million.

At
 the same time, Slavica agreed to settle her own outstanding taxes for 
having benefited from the trust, and she also paid the taxman 
£10million.

But it is the management of the family trust which has resulted in Ecclestone standing trial in Germany, charged with bribery.

In
 2002, the then majority-owner of Formula One, a German TV tycoon, 
became bankrupt. His shares were seized by a German bank which had 
loaned him the money for the original purchase.

In
 a complicated case, the German authorities allege that Ecclestone 
bribed the German banker controlling the shares to ensure that Formula 
One was sold to a private equity group of Ecclestone's choice.

The
 prosecution alleges that by securing the sale of the stake to the 
company, Ecclestone would remain in charge of Formula One and its 
commercial rights, broadcast payments and sponsorship deals.

Ecclestone,
 who once advised me: 'Never threaten – just do it!', admits making the 
payment but says he was the victim of blackmail connected to the issue 
of whether he controlled his family trust in Switzerland.

Having
 transformed himself from a second-hand car dealer into the owner of one
 of the world's most popular sports, he admits he breaks rules – but not
 laws.

Controversially,
 he has said: 'First get on, then get rich, then get honest,' and, 'In 
Formula One, everyone cheats. The trick is not to get caught.'

Competitive to his core, with steel-tipped elbows, Ecclestone – like so many other tycoons – always wants to win.

'Show me a good loser,' he has said, 'and I'll show you a loser.'
