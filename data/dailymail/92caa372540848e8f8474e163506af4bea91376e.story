As a physical education teacher and Contiki Tour manager, she is used to speaking and dealing with people from all walks of life. 

But when Whitney Beseler appeared on Channel Nine's Hot Seat on Tuesday night, it seems being in front of a national audience got the better of her. 

The blonde beauty, who was the first of six contestants to sit down face-to-face with host Eddie McGuire, ended up answering a rather obvious question wrong.  

Stage fright: But when Whitney Beseler appeared on Channel Nine's Hot Seat on Tuesday night, it seems being in front of a national audience got the better of her 

'Which of these is not a piece of jewellery commonly worn to symbolise a relationship between two people?' Eddie asked Whitney. 

As four options were read out in front of her, Whitney nodded and considered each possibility.

With four options - engagement ring, anniversary ring, wedding ring and burger ring, which is a famous Australian brand of chips - it appeared  quite easy to identify the correct answer through a swift process of elimination.

But after hesitating and letting out a small giggle, Whitney said 'uh... ooh I think I'm going to go with B on that one Eddie, the anniversary ring'. 

Not quite right: The blonde beauty who was the first of six contestants to sit down face-to-face with host Eddie McGuire, ended up answering a rather obvious question wrong 

Stunned: Astounded himself by Whitney's certainty, the show's Eddie McGuire asked the contestant to 'have another look' at the options

'Although burger ring's an interesting one,' she added. 

Looking up at the host she looked quite confident with her answer, flashing a friendly smile for the cameras as all eyes were on her. 

Astounded himself by Whitney's certainty, Eddie asked the contestant to 'have another look' at the options.

But when she chose the anniversary ring option again, he had no choice but to lock in her final answer.

Realisation: Oblivious of why audience members were giggling in the background, Whitney soon after realised her mistake when Eddie repeated the question again 

Amused: Eddie couldn't believe Whitney got the rather obvious question wrong 

Oblivious of why audience members were giggling in the background, Whitney soon after realised her mistake when Eddie repeated the question again.

'Oh my god Eddie that's the most embarrassing thing that's ever happened to me,' she finally exclaimed, with still a wide smile on her face and taking the loss in good spirits. 

'Can we cut and start again?' she then pleaded with Eddie, but he said 'that's why it's called the Hot Seat' and unfortunately the game was over for her. 

Game over: While she then pleaded Eddie to give her another chance, the host said Whitney's time on the show was over
