Teachers yesterday threatened strikes on a new front – in defence of ‘essential’ six-week  summer holidays.

They vowed to resist attempts to introduce four-week holidays, insisting longer breaks were needed to counter ‘excessive’ workloads.

Both Prime Minister David Cameron and Education Secretary Michael Gove have signalled support for a shorter summer holiday and longer school day.

Nottingham has become the first local authority in the country to propose switching all its schools from a traditional three-term calendar to five terms, with a four-week summer break.

But members of the National Union of Teachers branded the plans ‘scandalous’ and approved campaigns – including walkouts – to halt them.

The union, with nearly 300,000 active members, has already used its annual Easter conference to back industrial action over pay, pensions, academies, free schools, Ofsted inspections and a new reading test for five-year-olds.

Most strike resolutions were passed with little or no opposition, fuelling claims that hardline Trotskyists are growing in influence over the country’s biggest classroom union.

Delegates heard from self-styled ‘revolutionary socialists’ demanding ‘mass resistance on the streets’ to overthrow a so-called Coalition ‘dictatorship’.

Militants pressed the union’s leadership for a national strike to be staged on May 10 over cuts to pensions, despite claims it would disrupt preparations for national tests the week after.

In the latest debate, delegates also backed ‘campaigns, up to and including national ballots for both non-strike sanctions and strike action’ to fight ‘excessive workload’.

These workload concerns include plans in some areas to reorganise the school year, the conference was told.

NUT members in Nottingham have already staged a one-day strike over the plans, with two more due later this month.

Sheena Wheatley, secretary of the NUT’s Nottingham branch, claimed the five-term year proposals ‘represent a major attack on our conditions of service’.

Critics of the current school year say a shorter summer holiday would boost standards.

But delegates at the NUT’s annual conference in Torquay dismissed the claims. Tom Unterrainer, president of the NUT’s Nottingham branch, said:

‘We’ve looked for rigorous academic research which points to the fact that learning loss takes place. There is none.’

NUT members passed a resolution saying that ‘demands on teachers are so high during term-time that the longer summer break is an essential factor in a teacher’s management of excessive workload and work stress’.

John Illingworth, former national president of the NUT, said: ‘If this goes ahead, we in Nottingham will have the shortest school summer break in the world, at just over four weeks.

‘It’s true that South Korea have only five weeks, and a much longer working day. They also have the highest child suicide rate in the world.’

But a Department for Education spokesman said: ‘The fact is we have inherited a school year designed for children in the 1900s not the 21st century, so it’s right that heads are seizing the initiative and changing it.'
