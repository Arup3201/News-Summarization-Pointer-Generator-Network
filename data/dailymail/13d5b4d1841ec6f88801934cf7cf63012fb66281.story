A Chinese mining billionaire who once launched a bid for Australia's Sundance Resources was executed for multiple murders today.

Liu Han, his younger brother Liu Wei and three accomplices were condemned to death in May for 'organising and leading a mafia-style group', murder and other crimes.

Their appeals were unsuccessful and all five were put to death, the Xianning Intermediate court in the central province of Hubei has confirmed. 

Liu Han, a Chinese mining billionaire said to have links with disgraced former security tsar Zhou Yongkang, has been executed for 'organising and leading a mafia-style group', murder and other crimes

The group were said to have met with their families before being executed.   

'The executed criminals' legal rights were fully protected,' the court added.

Liu, 48, was the former chairman of Hanlong Group, who were involved in mining, real estate, electricity, energy and finance.  

The Liu siblings were said to have built an empire after starting out running gambling dens. 

Liu was said to have had links to former security czar Zhou Yongkang who was the most high profile official caught in China's anti corruption campaign. 

Hanlong was based in the southwestern province of Sichuan and launched a takeover bid of more than $1 billion for Sundance, a listed Australian iron ore firm, in 2011.

The deal collapsed in 2013 after the Chinese firm failed to follow through. Chinese media reports said at the time that Liu had been detained.

Sichuan is one of the power bases of Zhou, who once enjoyed vast power as China's security chief but whose targeting in a corruption investigation was announced in July.

The influential business magazine Caixin has reported that Liu once had dealings with a businessman believed to be Zhou's son. State media have also hinted that the gang had connections to central government officials.

Zhou was handed over to prosecutors in December.

The official announcement of the long-rumoured probe into Zhou made him the most senior member of the Communist Party to be investigated since the infamous Gang of Four - a faction that included the widow of founding leader Mao Zedong - were put on trial in 1980.

At the time of their trial, state media reported that the Liu brothers had started out by running gambling dens in their base in Guanghan, in China's southwestern Sichuan province, in the early 1990s.

The brothers were said to have gathered 'a gang of local thugs and vagrants' around them.

A public shooting at a Gyanghan teahouse in January 2009, allegedly ordered by Liu Wei, brought them to the attention of authorities. 

His older brother also developed a reputation for philanthropy. He built a rural school campus in the aftermath of an earthquake in Sichuan in 2008.

Liu Wei had also been a torch-bearer in the build-up to the Beijing Olympics.
