Holiday nightmare: Heidi-Ray Noble Steeples suffered life-changing injuries when she fell from the top of a play area slide in Turkey

An eight-year-old girl lost a kidney after she went down a slide at a Thomas Cook resort and fell on a picket fence at the bottom.

Now her family are suing the holiday giant over the ‘life-changing injury’ she suffered, which has left her unable to participate in her favourite hobby of horse-riding

Heidi-Ray Noble Steeples landed on a ‘poorly positioned’ fence in the play area of a resort in Oludeniz, Turkey.

Heidi-Ray was rushed from the hotel to a local hospital where her kidney was removed during two weeks of treatment in August 2012.

She also developed pneumonia and suffered a bad reaction to plasters used on her wounds causing her further pain.

After returning to UK the youngster also faced a number of outpatient appointments with a renal specialist before being given the all-clear to return to school.

Her family, of Tingley, West Yorkshire, say Thomas Cook should take responsibility for her injuries, which have left her unable to take part in her beloved hobby of horse riding.

They have instructed specialist lawyers at legal firm Irwin Mitchell to secure a settlement on her behalf.

Mother Sarah Noble Steeples said: ‘Falling from that slide has changed her life forever.

‘It could all so easily have been prevented if the resort had taken more care with the layout of its play area.

‘It was heartbreaking to see Heidi in such pain on what should have been a really enjoyable holiday and it was an incredibly difficult time for the family.

Legal action: Heidi-Ray's family is suing Thomas Cook over the injuries

Lengthy treatment: After Heidi-Ray injured herself at Oludeniz (pictured), she required a two-week stay in hospital

‘Whilst Heidi has made a good recovery, it is such a shame that she is no longer able to take part in the same activities that she did before the accident.

‘It was very upsetting for Heidi to be told that she could not go back to horse riding.’

She added: ‘We want to make sure somebody takes responsibility for Heidi’s fall.

‘There’s no excuse for an eight-year-old having to go through this and having to adjust to life after the incident without being able to return to all of the things she used to love doing.’

Demetrius Danas, an international personal injury law specialist at Irwin Mitchell, said: ‘Heidi’s life has been changed greatly because of the fall.

‘Losing a kidney is a very serious, life-changing event and a hugely stressful situation for anybody, let alone an eight-year-old girl.

‘We have started legal action against Thomas Cook following the incident and have invited them to admit responsibility for what happened to Heidi.

‘We hope that Thomas Cook will now work with us constructively to provide Heidi with a full and fair financial settlement for the injuries she has sustained and the treatment, care and support she has needed to date as well as any that she may require in the future.’

Thomas Cook said: ‘We were naturally very concerned to hear about Miss Noble Steeples’ accident while on holiday with us.

‘As we are in the process of liaising directly with the family’s legal representative in relation to this, we are unable to provide any further comment at this time.’

The hotel removed the fence following the accident and put up a sign saying children should be supervised in the play area.
