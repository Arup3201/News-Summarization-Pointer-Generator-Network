An off duty police officer has shot his neighbour's dog dead in front of it's 12-year-old owner, after it allegedly attacked him and his wife.

The Fitzhenry family, from Harris County, Texas, say their beloved boxer dog, Gunner - who they described as a big softie - was shot by the off-duty Houston police officer on Friday along a pathway.

Houston Police Department Officer Mark Condon claims the four-year-old dog charged at him and his wife, after it escaped from the Fitzhenry's garden by accident.

But according to 12-year-old Dalton Fitzhenry, who family say treated the dog like a brother,  the pet had only wanted to play.

The Fitzhenry family, from Harris County, say their beloved boxer dog, Gunner, was shot by an off-duty Houston police officer on Friday along a pathway

They say the four-year-old dog escaped from their garden by accident after their children opened the gate and went to pick up a ball they had been playing with

Mr Condon, said: 'The dog charged us and attacked me, my wife and one of our dogs.'

He fired at the dog, striking it in the neck, Khoun.com reports.

He claim details of the injuries he, his wife, and dog suffered, have been recorded by police.

The
Fitzhenrys said Gunner was one of the family and losing the animal was 
like 'losing an older brother' for their children. They now plan to 
lodge a formal complaint with HPD.

Dalton, 12, said the officer had shot the dog at point blank range. The animal died on the way to a vet.

He added: 'He just pulled it out, like, point-blank range and shot.

'Gunner didn’t have the chance to run.'

Dalton’s parents said the boy was screaming and crying as he watched the ordeal.

The officer claims he fired at the dog, because it injured both himself and his wife, and also his dog. But according to 12-year-old Dalton Fitzhenry, the pet had only wanted to play

In a statement, Mr Condon said: 'I have owned dogs and have been an animal lover my entire life.

'The last thing I would ever want to do is hurt an animal, especially someone’s pet.'

The Fitzhenry family plans to lodge a formal complaint with HPD.

Neighbours on Cascade Bend Lane said their children had happily played with the animal in the past and referred to him as a 'big softie'.
