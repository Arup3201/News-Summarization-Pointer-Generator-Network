Aston Villa are understood to be in detailed negotiations with a prospective buyer as American owner Randy Lerner moves closer to selling the club this summer.

Lerner has been publicly looking for a sale since last May, and meaningful conversations have taken place with an interested party.

Finding a buyer with Villa in such a perilous position has proved difficult, but the bounce caused by Tim Sherwood’s arrival could accelerate the process.

Aston Villa are in negotiations with a prospective buyer as American owner Randy Lerner looks to sell the club

Lerner has been publicly looking for a sale since last May and he is believed to want around £150million

Lerner is believed to want around £150million for the club he acquired for £62.7m in 2006, spending around £300m in total of his own cash taking in transfers and wages during his time.

The identity of the bidder is a closely guarded secret given the vast sums involved and any announcement might not take place until the season is over or Villa mathematically safe.

But indications are Lerner’s nine-year stay as custodian of Birmingham’s biggest club is edging towards an end.
