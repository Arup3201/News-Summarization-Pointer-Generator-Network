One of the men filmed destroying a 20-million-year-old rock formation in a Utah state park only last month sued another driver claiming his back was severely injured in a 2009 chain-reaction accident.

Seen in the video toppling the rock formation in Goblin Valley State Park, Glenn Taylor is able to force it off it's wobbly perch before high-fiving son Dylan Taylor - all on a back he claims was severely injured.

The footage, which the Taylors and friend Dave Hall posted to their Facebook pages, shows Glenn Taylor and son Dylan enthusiastically celebrating the destruction of the rock formation. The elder Taylor even jokingly flexes his muscles, proud of his achievement.

Filed at the beginning of September, the lawsuit claims that Glenn Taylor severely injured his back in the 2009 lawsuit.

The Utah man has had to 'endure great pain and suffering, disability, impairment, loss of joy of life,' the suit says, according to an attorney who spoke to KUTV. The lawsuit also called the accident 'debilitating,' the station noted.

Alan Macdonald, the attorney representing the woman being sued, told the station that Glenn Taylor was one of many motorists rear-ended, and that no one involved complained of pain or went to a hospital.

After seeing the ridiculous video, the attorney feels the case has no merit.

'He's climbing over other rocks, then he lines up, gets leverage and pushes that big old rock several times before he finally pushes it over,' the confused attorney told the station.

'Then he turns and twists and high fives and yucks it up and flexes his muscles he just doesn't look like a terribly disabled person to me,' Mr Macdonald adds.

In his client's defense, attorney Mark Stubbs told KUTV that Glenn Taylor is suing for payment of prior medical bills stemming from the accident and that medical bills may continue into the future.

He does admit, though, that a jusry trial involving the tape might not go particularly well.

Utah State Parks officials have said 
that the three men could face felony charges for destroying the 
formation, which has been there for 20 million years.

Speaking to the Salt Lake Tribune, Mr Hall said he has received dozen of death threats in the past week.

'I’ve got over 100 death threats on the Internet already,' said Mr Hall.

'I’ve
 got people all over the world telling me they are going to kill me 
because I made the decision that lives are more important than this rock
 staying here a few more hours,' he added.

Despite 
attracting possible criminal charges and the continuing hatred of people
 across the globe, Mr Hall continued to defend his group's actions.

'I think we made the right decision, but probably the wrong method,' he explained
 to the Tribune. 'we take full responsibility for whatever mistake we 
made, and we’re open to whatever that means from the state, from the Boy
 Scouts’ office, etc.'

A criminal investigation is now underway in the incident, which occurred on October 11, spokesman Eugene Swalberg told the Tribune.

'It
 is not only wrong, but there will
 be consequences,' he said. 'This is highly, highly inappropriate. This 
is not what you do at state parks. It’s disturbing and upsetting.'

Deputy Emery County Attorney 
Brent Langston said he was aware of the incident but that it has not yet
 reached his office. If it does, he will consider whether to bring 
charges.

He said they could face anywhere from a 
class B misdemeanor (up to six months in prison) to a second-degree felony (one to 15 years in prison) depending on how much the 
formation is valued, the Tribune reported.

He added: 'Some things can’t be replaced, like photographs in a family album, but they have great sentimental value.'

The rock formations at Goblin Valley State Park in Utah are thousands of years old, formed by the erosion of the material around the base of the rock

Proud: The men said they were 'saving lives' because the loose rock could have fallen on a child

But the men insist that they only pushed the rock to the ground because it was unstable and they were concerned about it crushing a child playing nearby.

On the video, Hall says: 'Some little kid was about ready to walk down here and die and Glenn saved his life by getting the boulder out of the way. So it’s all about saving lives here at Goblin Valley.'

Taylor said he had seen a family walk close to the rock and when he touched it, it was loose.

'I put my hand on a rock and it moved,' 
he said. 'While we were sitting right there we thought, "Man if this 
rock falls it’ll kill them".' I didn’t have to push hard.'

But when they left, he said he thought that he probably should have contacted a ranger before taking action. But the men said they had only seen one in the park that day.

Goblin Valley is more than 3,600 acres of desert with hoodoo rock formations in Utah

Still, they apologized for their actions and said they wish they could have dealt with it differently.

'Glad we did it, wish we wouldn’t have done it,' Glenn Taylor said.

Hall added: 'We're extremely sorry for 
our actions. There was no in way shape or form any intent to go out 
there and cause any harm to our natural resources.'

Swalbery added that seeing a loose rock does not mean a person should push it over.

Glenn Taylor and Hall are leaders for the local Boy Scouts troop and that they are also Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints youth leaders.

They said authorities have not yet contacted them about the incident.
