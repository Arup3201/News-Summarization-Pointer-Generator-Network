Dressed all in white, Sir Cliff Richard took the stage at Billy Graham's evangelical rally to a deafening roar from his fans.

For Pauline Wraith, one of the 47,000 packed into Sheffield's Bramall Lane stadium on a rainy June night in 1985, it was a moment she never forgot.

That night, she became a committed Christian. She travelled by coach with her sister-in-law to the world famous US preacher's rally because she was a Cliff Richard fan and heard he was going to be a celebrity guest at the event.

The pop star's gospel songs and moving speech about his Christianity changed her life forever.

The 75-year-old grandmother, who still lives in Sheffield, said: 'He talked about how he became a Christian.

'He was just singing on his own from a platform on the pitch and talking. It was a very full stadium. At the time, Cliff was a big star but his Christianity came before everything else.'

When Graham invited members of the crowd to step forward as a public commitment to Jesus, she did so.

'I went forward and gave my life to Jesus. Somebody came to speak to me and gave me a card. I was put in touch with a Methodist church and I've been going ever since.'

After his appearance, Sir Cliff told a local newspaper he was on 'a tremendous high.'

Sir Cliff has described the American evangelist as one of his 'heroes'

He said: 'It's been a busy day and I've loved it. Taking part in the meeting was a great experience for me. Billy Graham has everything you always wished you had yourself – charisma for example.'

Sir Cliff, who has described the American evangelist as one of his 'heroes', had already appeared several times at his so-called crusades, making speeches at Earls Court in 1960s and Birmingham in 1984.

The singer chose a Graham rally in London in 1966 to announce that he was a Christian. Dubbed 'America's pastor', Graham has also been a counsellor to former US presidents Richard Nixon, George Bush Sr and George W Bush. 

Around 250,000 people attended the preacher's eight days of mass religious 'meetings' at the Sheffield stadium in 1985.

The alleged assault is said to have taken place during one of these events. There had been controversy prior to Sir Cliff's guest appearance, on June 28.

The singer was said to be on a United Nations blacklist for concerts played in South Africa four years earlier during the apartheid regime. But his appearance went ahead without any trouble.

A police officer, who was given the job of looking after his car at the stadium, remembered what a 'nice bloke' he was.

He said: 'He had tea and biscuits sent to the police room for the duty officers with a note thanking us for looking after him.'
