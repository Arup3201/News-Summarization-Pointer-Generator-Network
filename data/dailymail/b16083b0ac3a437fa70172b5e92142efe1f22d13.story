The birth of bilby joeys have topped off an exciting year that saw the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge officially opening the bilby exhibit named in honour of their son, Prince George.

Prince George, accompanied by his parents to the ceremony, unveiled a plaque commemorating the dedication of the Prince George Bilby Exhibit at Sydney Taronga Zoo earlier this year.

Following the royal visit first time mother Yajala gave birth to two joeys around 10 weeks ago but they have only just begun emerging from their underground nest.

Taronga Zoo’s national breeding program has led to its first-ever successful births of joeys at the Prince George Bilby Exhibit in Sydney

Despite the threatened marsupial species, the Zoo’s national breeding program has led to its first-ever successful births of joeys after their mother, who arrived from Monarto Zoo in South Australia in 2013, had a successful pairing with Taronga's male bilby, also named George.

‘This breeding success will help us build on the incredible exposure of the visit by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their son Prince George, which brought the message of bilby conservation to the world,’ Taronga Zoo director Cameron Kerr said.

The Royal couple visited the Sydney landmark on April 20 and were introduced to some of Australia’s unique and endangered wildlife before the ceremony, which was part of the Australian government’s official gift following his birth in mid-2013.

Bilby keeper Paul Davies said: ‘I’d like to think there was a little Royal magic at work in the birth of these joeys. 

'You could say the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge brought us good luck, as it’s after their visit that we’ve been able to breed Bilbies for the very first time.’

The gestation period for the joeys is only 14 days – one of the shortest of all mammals before they are carried in their mother’s pouch for about 75 days.

Mr Davies said keepers had yet to determine the sex of the two joeys, who still spend much of their time underground in their home at the Zoo’s Australian Nightlife exhibit.

‘Yajala is still quite secretive with the little ones. The best time to catch a glimpse of them is between 10-11am, but this time will extend each day as the joeys grow in confidence and become more independent from their mother,’ he said.

Bilbies once ranged over most of mainland Australia, but have suffered a catastrophic decline over the past 200 years due to predation by feral animals such as foxes and cats, competition with rabbits and habitat loss.

Taronga has begun conservation partnerships with the Save the Bilby Fund and Australian Wildlife Conservancy to help protect Bilbies and their remaining habitat in the wild.
