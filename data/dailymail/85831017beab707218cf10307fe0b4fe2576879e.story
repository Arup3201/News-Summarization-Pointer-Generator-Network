The Olympic Flame was officially handed over to London yesterday in an Athens ceremony, featuring a 2012 delegation including David Beckham, Boris Johnson and Princess Anne.

The historic event took place in a rain-hit sundown ceremony at the Panathenaic stadium in Athens, venue of the first modern Olympics in 1896.

But the flame stayed lit and will now make its way back to the UK where it will start a 70-day 8,000 mile relay around Britain.

Despite the buzz surrounding the last-minute news that the LA Galaxy star was flying in specially to be part of the ancient ceremony, the more formal duties came down to the Princess Royal as leader of the British delegation to Athens.

Both she and Karolos Papoulias, the Hellenic Republic president, sat in ancient thrones that are part of the stadium during the hour-long ceremony.

The flame was handed to the Princess, who was watched closely by other members of the official delegation including London 2012 chairman Lord Coe, Olympics minister Hugh Robertson, London mayor Boris Johnson, Beckham and five British sporting teenagers.

Each member of the British VIP delegation sheltered under blue umbrellas as they walked through the centre of the stadium to their front-row seats.

Everyone from the Princess Royal to Mr Robertson were named over the loudspeakers and greeted by cheers from the crowd.

There was also a chuckle from British people in the crowd as the announcer twice insisted on introducing Beckham as 'Sir David Beckham'.

And the hosts refused to let the rain dampen proceedings, beginning the ceremony with a torch relay before some traditional dancing and music.

Afterwards, the Mayor of London joked: ‘I can’t testify to the accuracy of the music or dances but I still thought they were fantastic.’

Organisers also won over Beckham by producing a group of schoolchildren to sing God Save The Queen, to which he mouthed every word.

Speaking in a BBC interview carried out before the ceremony began, Anne said: 'There's an awful lot of people for who the torch relay is the signal, the beginning of what the Olympics is all about.'

But she insisted it was important to see the Games as an opportunity, rather than an extravagance - at a time of economic difficulty.

The princess added: "There has been an awful lot of employment maintained and to some extent increased largely as a result of the Games taking place.

'And for some of those they will have gained skills because people have concentrated on the apprenticeship side of the equation...'

'So yes I understand that it looks like an extravagance but if they recognise the way a lot of that money has been spent, it's made a constructive impact on people's lives, particularly those setting out.'

London Mayor Boris Johnson, meanwhile, described the event as an 'an amazing day for us'.

He added: 'This is the moment when we prepare to take the torch and the eyes of the world are swivelling to London. I think they will see a city that has made phenomenal progress in getting ready ... by any, London is extraordinarily well prepared.

In his speech, Lord Coe thanked the damp crowd in the stadium for Greece's warm hospitality and also for 'laying on the British weather for us'.

The past week had linked Britain and Greece in a 'very special way in the spirit of peace and friendship', he said.

Lord Coe added: 'If the Olympic Games are about celebrating the best athletes in the world, the Olympic spirit is about celebrting the best in ourselves and in our communities.

'We have found the very best torchbearers who, like Olympic athletes, will inspire a generation.

'As we prepare to bring the flame to the UK, we are reminded of our responsiblity - like that of our predecessors in 1908 and especially 1948 - to stage Games that use the power of sport to unite the world in a celebration of achievement and inspiration in challenging times. A Games that will inspire the next generation to choose sport.'

The youngsters taking part in the handover were picked by London 2012 for displaying Olympic values. During the ceremony they exchanged symbolic olive branches to the tune of John Lennon's Imagine.

The five, who come from different national regions, are from schools and colleges which are part of London 2012's Get Set education network and school linking programmes run by the British Council.

The Olympic Flame has been taken on a relay around the Greek mainland and islands since it was lit by the rays of the sun in ancient Olympia last week.

The torchbearers have been taking it from Olympia to the Panathenaic Stadium. The Olympic flame was "laid to rest" at the Acropolis overnight before being taken on the eighth and final day of its Greek relay - taking it to the Acropolis Museum, the centre of Athens, Zappeio and to the handover ceremony.

A trio of world champions brought the flame safely to the stadium. It arrived in the hands of rower Christina Giazitzidou and was carried by gymnast Vasilis Tsolakidis and rower Alexandra Tsiavou.

Chinese gymnast Li Ning, who lit the cauldron at the opening ceremony for the 2008 Beijing Games, and Greek weightlifter Pyrros Dimas were the last torchbearers in Greece.

The ceremony also included priestesses in a performance choreographed by Artemis Ignatiou.

The British delegates fly back tomorrow evening, landing at RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall, where they will attend a special ceremony welcoming the flame.

The flame has been given special clearance to travel onboard a plane. It will rest in a special cradle and be secured into its seat by a secure holding device.

When it arrives on British soil, a 70-day relay, involving 8,000 torchbearers covering 8,000 miles, will take the flame to east London's Olympic Stadium and the opening of the Games on July 27.
