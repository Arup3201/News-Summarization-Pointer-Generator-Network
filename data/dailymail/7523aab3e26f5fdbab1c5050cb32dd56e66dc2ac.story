Attack: David Rawson, 25, groped the woman in her bed after being mistakenly let into the room, Burnley Crown Court heard

A drunk wedding guest who managed to get into a woman's hotel room and groped her as she tried to sleep avoided a jail sentence after a judge told him 'you are no sexual predator'.

David Rawson, 25, carried out his attack after being let in by the victim at 4am who wrongly assumed it was a female friend she was sharing a room with who was knocking on the door.

She opened it and in the darkness did not realise it was former soldier Rawson so she went back to bed.

The defendant then got in alongside the woman and began to grope her.

The judge at Burnley Crown Court was told Rawson was was 'out of his head' after snorting 
cocaine and drinking beer and wine during the wedding party at the 50-bedroom Oaks Hotel, in Brierfield, Lancashire.

Prosecutor Mark Lamberty said Rawson had been invited to the wedding reception along with his victim.

He said that as Rawson carried out his attack the victim suddenly realised what was happening and thrust him away before rushing to the reception area to try and get some help.

Mr Lamberty said the woman returned to 
her room and told the defendant to leave, but he refused.

She got 
dressed and left the room and police were called.

After the incident a fight broke out between Rawson and his brother which culminated in him grabbing him by the neck and pinning him against the wall.

He was eventually calmed down by others and started to cry.

Rawson who works at a carpet making 
factory was questioned, agreed he had been in a scuffle with his 
brother, but denied going to the woman’s room and the sexual assault.

But he admitted sexual touching and two counts of assault by beating following the incident on May 31.

Defending him, David Bruce described the case as 'quite unusual and sad'. He said the year before, the defendant had left the Forces.

He added that Rawson had fallen out with his girlfriend of around a year a few weeks before the incident and had been hospitalised after trying to take his own life.

Mr Bruce added: 'He has very little recollection of what went on that evening. He was out of his head. He had had a cocktail of anti-depressants, drugs and alcohol.'

'He describes this incident as at a time when he was in a very dark place. He can’t begin to explain it. He is devastated and feels very ashamed for what he has done on that particular evening.'

Rawson, of Bury, was given 14 months in jail, suspended for two years, with 12 months’ supervision.

He was ordered to sign the Sex Offenders’ Register for 10 years.

Judge Beverley Lunt told Rawson: 'I accept it’s wholly out of character for you and I accept it because you had taken of cocktail of alcohol and drugs. You are not a sexual predator. You are not a sexual danger to society.

'Drugs and alcohol abuse was the root of this entire incident.'
