Owners of nursing homes which offer 'shocking' standards of care will be prosecuted, a Liberal Democrat health minister has pledged.

Norman Lamb said the Government is introducing 'fundamental standards' in April next year to ensure there is 'no hiding place' for care home which mentally and physically abuse residents.

He highlighted Merok Park home in Banstead, Surrey, which was closed earlier this month after inspectors found distressed residents 'crying out for help' and branded the place 'dangerous'.

In chaotic scenes, pensioners were carried out in the freezing night to waiting ambulances after they were deemed 'at significant risk of harm'.

'The conditions at Merok Park were really shocking,' Mr Lamb told the Sunday Telegraph.

'Those responsible for such shocking standards have no place in care. There must be no hiding place for poor care and we must ensure that people are held to account if that ever happens.

'It's vital that people have confidence that the place where their loved one is being cared for is safe and provides compassionate, kind care.'

He said that when care home companies fall short of standards 'in a serious way' which leads to suffering, the company and 'culpable directors' can be prosecuted.

Directors of care homes will be given a 'fit and proper person test' in an attempt to drive out those responsible for the worst scandals.

All care workers will be required to undergo training under a new care certificate scheme from next year, which Mr Lamb described as 'pretty close to compulsory minimum training standards'.

This comes after figures revealed that 522 care homes and services helping elderly and disabled adults with tasks such as dressing, and preparing meals, did not have adequate staffing figures.

Care home watchdog, the Care Quality Commission said this equated to one in 10 of all the elderly services inspected during the course of the year.

'If nine out of 10 are capable of doing it then 10 out of 10 are able to do it,' Mr Lamb said.

Families worried that their elderly relatives are being abuse by care home staff are soon to be given official advice on how to secretly install CCTV cameras.

The CQC will issue guidance in the New Year explaining how to best monitor staff.

Mr Lamb also warned that local authorities, which commission care services must be held to account and said the public had to decide whether they are prepared to spend more on care as the population ages

Last week Andrea Sutcliffe, the head of adult social care inspections at the CQC, warned that Britain did not care enough about elderly people to be able to guarantee them dignified support.

In June Daniel Baynes was jailed for four months after he was caught abusing 79-year-old dementia sufferer Gladys Wright on a hidden camera installed by her son James.

He and two colleagues, Tomasz Gidaszewski and Janusz Salnikow, were captured swearing at Mrs Wright and manhandling her at Granary Care Home, in Wraxall, North Somerset.= 

Dementia sufferer and former nurse Mrs Rees was left with bruises after the ill treatment at the NHS Mary Seacole Nursing Home in Hoxton, east London.  

She was secretly filmed being abused by Faderera Grace Bello, 54, a staff nurse at an NHS care home and died in May aged 92 following the mistreatment. 

Gloria Foster, 81, died when she was left without food and medication for nine days after her care provider, Carefirst24, was shut down by immigration officers. 

Faderera Grace Bello was jailed for carer ill treatment and wilful neglect after Veronica Davis secretly filmed Bello poking her mother Bridget Rees in the face
