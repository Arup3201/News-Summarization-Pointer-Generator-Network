A mother who was impaled by a pole during a car crash has admitted that she is lucky to be alive after she veered off the road while sending a text message. The pole entered her car through a front light here 

Mrs Jahnz was sending a colleague a text to say she would be late for work when she veered off the road and hit a guardrail. She released the images of her totaled car to warn other motorists not to text and drive

She told 9 News that she had just dropped her daughter  at school when she realized the girl had forgotten her saxophone.

She was on her way home to collect the instrument when she began sending a voice text to tell her friend she would be late for a work meeting.

Mrs Jahnz told 9 News: 'I looked down to make sure it [the text] was all right. The next thing I knew, I was looking up, there was white powder from the air bags deployed.'

The mother said she had at least 40 stitches before she stopped counting and added that she also had to be sewn up on the inside. 

She said that medics told her if the pole had come through the front of her car at just a slightly different angle, she would have bled to death.

She was released from hospital on Sunday and is expected to recover fully from her injuries.
