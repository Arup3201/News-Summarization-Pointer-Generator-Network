Commuters face a New Year hammering with rail fares to rise by 4.1 per cent.

Latest inflation figures used to set increase in ticket costs hit 3.1 per cent last month, and train companies can add an extra one per cent to price rises.

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, who sets the rules on fares, said it would be another two years before inflation-busting increases would come to an end as he admitted: 'Nobody likes to see rail fares go up. I don't like to see it and passengers don't like to see it.'

Campaigners say January's rise will be the sixth time in seven years, as rail fares have outstripped wages

Protests against rail fare rises were held across the country today, as it emerged that the cost of train 
travel next year will be 40 per cent higher than in 2008.

Campaigners say January’s rise will be the sixth time in seven years rail fares have outstripped wages.

Although
ticket prices will have risen by 40 per cent since 2008, average 
earnings are only expected to have increased by 15 per cent.

Mr McLoughlin said: 'Running the railways is a very expensive business. The taxpayer overall is contributing a lot and I am afraid that the passenger has to make his contribution. He does it as a taxpayer and as a passenger as well.'

Mr McLoughlin said he hoped above-inflation rises would end by 2015 in line with estimates by the Office of Budget Responsibility's estimates.

But his Labour opponent Maria Eagle said:  'David Cameron’s cost of living crisis is leaving families struggling and yet another year of inflation-busting fare rises will just add to the pressure on household budgets.

Big money bonuses are needed to coax Network Rail bosses into improving services, the Transport Secretary insisted.

Patrick McLoughlin was challenged over why extra payouts were needed for the firm which runs the nation's rail tracks.

Chief executive Sir David Higgins and four other Network Rail directors could be paid more than £11million over the next three years – £5million of it in bonuses if they meet performance targets.

Sir David intends to leave next year, and is likely to walk away with a severance pay and bonus pot worth up to £1million.

But Mr McLoughlin told BBC Radio 4: 'Bonuses is one way which is a reward for delivering those services and has been seen across the front.

'I think there are certain people in the BBC who get bonuses too.'

Mr McLoughlin added: 'There's a bit more than just doing their job. We are talking about some very, very complicated engineering works that are going on.'

'At a time when wages are stagnant or falling, it is completely out of touch for Ministers to allow fares to go up by as much as 9.1 per cent again, yet allow private train companies to walk away with £305 million from passengers each year.

'Labour would ban train companies from hiking fares beyond a strict one per cent above inflation limit, introduce a legal right to the cheapest ticket and crack down on rising car parking charges at stations.'

The TUC and the Action For Rail campaign group planned to stage demonstrations at almost 50 stations to mark the publication of the latest retail price index (RPI) inflation figure, which is used to calculate next year’s rail fare rise.

While the average rise in fares will be capped at 4.1 per cent, the TUC warned some season tickets could rise 9 per cent against forecasts of a 2.4 per cent increase in average earnings next year.

It said rail privatisation was costing taxpayers £1.2billion a year despite ‘minimal’ investment in trains and stations.

General secretary Frances O’Grady said: ‘Every year, hard-pressed rail commuters have to hand over an ever greater share of their earnings just to get to and from work.

‘Wage-busting fare rises are not even going on much-needed service improvements. Instead, passenger and public subsidies are lining the pockets of the shareholders of private rail companies.’

Stephen Joseph, of the Campaign for Better Transport, said: ‘Getting to work is the biggest single monthly outgoing for many commuters, more than food, more than housing. 

‘One of the surest ways of stamping on any green shoots of recovery is to price people off the trains and out of the jobs market.’

Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers’ union Aslef, said: ‘The increased costs of travel, and the inability of some to afford to travel, contrasts with the increased profits made by train companies.’

Julia Long, of the Unite union, said: ‘The current system of privately-owned operators is haemorrhaging enough cash each year to cut fares by at least 18 per cent without reducing staff or services. Yet every year we see fares soar way beyond the inflation rate.’

Protests against rail fare rises will be held across the country today as it emerged that the cost of train travel next year will be 40 per cent higher than in 2008

But Michael Roberts, chief executive of the Association of Train Operating Companies, said: ‘Government determines how the average season ticket price rise is set each year. Since 2004, it has been Government policy to allow regulated fares to rise above inflation to support investment in more trains, better stations and faster services.

‘This is helping to drive passenger satisfaction to near record levels while seeking to reduce taxpayers’ contribution towards the cost of running the railways.

‘To help limit future fare rises, the rail industry is working with the Government to find ways of providing services even more efficiently.’
