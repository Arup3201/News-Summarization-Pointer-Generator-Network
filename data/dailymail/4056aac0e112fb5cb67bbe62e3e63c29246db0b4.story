A 21-year-old mother of five from Denver has been charged in the beating death of her 2-month-old daughter after a night of heavy drinking.

Kelsy Newell-Skinner was arrested last Monday and remains in custody for allegedly beating her daughter, Natalee Marie Skinner-Hurst, over the weekend.

The infant, who died at a hospital last Thursday, was brain dead and had multiple injuries, including severe bruising on her head, a swollen left eye, fractured ribs and what are thought to be bite marks on her left thigh.

Crime scene: The mother texted her ex-boyfriend telling him she woke up in her Denver apartment to discover her infant daughter badly beaten

An arrest affidavit cited by Denver Westword Blogs says Newell-Skinner texted her ex-boyfriend – the father of three of her children - Sunday saying, ‘She must have been very drunk last night because she just woke up and the baby had been beaten.’

Newell-Skinner's mother rushed to her apartment and took her fatally injured granddaughter to the hospital, but it was too late.

Ms Newell-Skinner has four other children under the age of five. 

According to the affidavit, a police officer was summoned to Children's Hospital at around 11pm on July 27 on suspicion of child abuse of an infant.

Kelsey Newell-Skinner was taken into custody July 28 on charges of felony child abuse, which were later upgraded to first-degree murder and child abuse resulting in death. She is being held on $500,000 bail, according to 9News.

Drunken stupor: The 21-year-old said she did not even remember anything about the night she allegedly beat up her daughter

The
 biological father of three of the young mother's children, identified 
in the court document as Chantz Darrow, told police that beginning at 
around noon on July 27, he received a series of text messages from 
Newell-Skinner telling him that she had found her daughter beaten.

One of the messages stated that ‘she did not even remember last night’ and ‘felt horrible.’

Darrow arrived at Newell-Skinner's home about two hours later to discover the dying baby.

The man called his ex-girlfriend’s mother, Krista Skinner, prompting the 21-year-old to flee the apartment for fear of being arrested by police.

When interviewed by investigators, baby Natalee's father, Jonathan Hurst, said that he last saw the 2-month-old the previous evening.

The father went off to work and spent the night at his mother's because he and Newell-Skinner had a fight, the station KWGN reported.

Krista Skinner, who was the one who drove Natalee to a local hospital for treatment, told police her daughter was depressed because she did not have any money.

The family have set up an online fundraiser to collect $5,000 towards baby Natalee’s final expenses.
