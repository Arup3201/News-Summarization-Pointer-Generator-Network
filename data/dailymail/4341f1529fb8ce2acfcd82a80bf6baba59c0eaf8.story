Vandals staged a sick tribute to a man accused of murdering two policewomen by spraying graffiti at the funeral of one of his alleged victims.

The words 'Dale Cregan is a God' were scrawled on the walls of the church as mourners were due to arrive for the burial service of Dave Short, 46, who was shot dead outside his home in August.

Cregan, 29, is awaiting trial accused of the murders of Mr Short, and his son Mark, 23, as well as  policewomen Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes

The risk of the day descending into further gang violence in the Droylsden area forced Greater Manchester Police to close 'all licensed premises' from 9am this morning.

The unprecedented step includes 27 outlets serving alcohol, including the town's football and cricket clubs, as well as the catholic and Conservative clubs.

Sick tribute: The yobs painted the message on the walls of the church as mourners were due to arrive for the burial service

Out of sight: Police managed to cover up the graffiti with a sheet and the paint was removed by council workmen before the service took place at St Willibrords Catholic Church in Clayton, Manchester

Make-shift cover: A white sheet was taped to the brick tape using duct tape

Accused: Dale Cregan who is awaiting trial

Ch Supt Nick Adderley said the 'potential for crime between feuding groups is such that this is necessary.'

The graffiti was covered 
with a sheet by police and the paint was removed by council workmen before the 
service took place at St Willibrords Catholic Church in Clayton, 
Manchester.

The
two policewomen were killed in a gun and grenade attack as they 
answered an apparently routine call last month in Hattersley.

In
the the run up to today's funeral for Short, the dead man’s widow 
Michelle issued a statement through an internet messaging service 
saying: 'Everyone who knew David are more than welcome to attend the 
service and the wake.

'I 
want to say a big thank you to those people that had nice words to say 
about my son Mark and my husband David on these sad times for myself and
the family.

'In times like these you know who your friends and enemies are.'

Police initially stood guard at the door of the church and warned onlookers it was a 'private family affair.'

Afterwards
they patrolled the area and a police helicopter flew overhead as over 
100 people lined the street to pay respect to Mr Short, whose coffin was taken to 
the church by a horse-drawn hearse.

Victims: David Short, with his son Mark, who died in May. Mark died after being shot, while David was the target of a grenade attack

The Buxton pub in Droylsden, one of dozens of pubs which were ordered to close

Shut down: The Church Hotel in Droylsden, which has been closed down for 24 hours - along with all other pubs in the area - for fears of gangland reprisals in the wake of David Short's funeral

Closure: Police won permission from the local magistrates' court to shut all 27 pubs in the locality for the day

The Kings Head pub in Droylsden was also shut like many other pubs in the local area

Empty: Droylsden pub, The Beehive was ordered to close its doors for 24 hours

The Halfway House pub was not open today, with a court order from Tameside Magistrates' Court on the door

Shut down: The Cotton Tree pub in Droylsden, which has been permanently closed down following the murders of Mark and David Short in the area

Floral
wreaths coloured in Short’s favourite Manchester City blue and white 
colours spelt the words husband, dad, David and No1BRO in the 
windows of the hearse.

The black 
horses donned Manchester City scarfs and blue feathered head pieces.

Six
black Mercedes limos parked up outside and out poured family and 
friends who embraced each other under colourful brollies.

Tragic: PCs Fiona Bone, left, and Nicola Hughes, right, were gunned down after being called to a burglary

A black hearse carried more flowers, spelling words brother, uncle and Grandad.

Red and black flowers in the shape of boxing gloves also lay in the hearse.

One tribute from Short’s wife said, ‘I will miss you always David, memories that will last a lifetime. Love Michelle.’

Commemoration: A horse-drawn carriage pulled the coffin to the church. A floral tribute reading Husband adorned the glass

Mourners follow the coffin from the church clutching a photo of Mr Short

A black hearse carried more flowers, spelling words brother, uncle and Grandad. Red and black flowers in the shape of boxing gloves also lay in the hearse

And another, ‘To uncle David, I have no words to write down so here goes.

‘It doesn’t seem real that you have gone, taken so suddenly when least expected. I love you so much miss you forever.'

A third said: 'You are too fearless to be forgotten.'

Grief: Widow Michelle Short, with her daughter Stacey on her left and her nephew John in a silver suit

Police stood by as mounters filed into the church holding flowers

Community: Locals turned up to watch the funeral procession despite the wet weather

Last
week council licensing bosses closed down the Cotton Tree Inn in 
Droylsden where Short’s son Mark was gunned down and killed in May.

It was thought that relatives of Short had hoped to hold the wake in one of the pubs closed down today. 

Chief Supt Nick Adderley, of Tameside Police, said: 'It is unprecedented to shut all the licensed premises in
a town, but we still believe that the potential for crime and disorder 
between feuding gangs is such that this is a necessary precaution.

'Residents are still feeling vulnerable following recent events and this is also an important step towards reassuring them.

Police presence: Police were among the crowds outside St Willibrord's Catholic Church Clayton

Removed: The graffiti was washed off the wall by a council worker

'This
is part of our ongoing work to make sure organised crime and fear of 
crime is eradicated from these communities. We appreciate the 
co-operation of the licensees.'

The funerals of the two policewomen will take place at Manchester Cathedral this week.

A police spokesman said of the graffiti: 'Shortly after 7am on Tuesday, 2 October 2012, police received a report of criminal damage at a church on North Road, Clayton.

'The damage relates to graffiti spray-painted onto the side of the church. The graffiti was swiftly removed by council staff.'
