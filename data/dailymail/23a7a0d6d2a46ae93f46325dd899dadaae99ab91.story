A jury on Monday cleared a doctor of negligence in a lawsuit filed by a Delaware truck driver who underwent a penile implant procedure and ended up with an erection that lasted eight months.

'We're stunned,' attorney Michael Heyden said as he left the New Castle County courthouse, where his client Daniel Metzgar, 44, of Newark, was suing urologist Thomas Desperito of Wilmington, Delaware.

In April 2010, four months after the procedure was performed, Metzgar experienced swelling and went to a hospital, where he underwent testing. Before going to the hospital, Metzgar had been unable to reach Dr Desperito.

The doctor's lawyer argued that hospital staff who performed tests were unfamiliar with penile implants and were not properly trained to do them. Therefore, the results from the tests, including images showing swelling, did not prove negligence.

Metzgar and his attorney during the one-week trial described the frequent discomfort and daily embarrassment he experienced after the procedure - including trouble riding a motorcycle, wearing normal clothes and joining family social events.

'I could hardly dance, with an erection poking my partner,' Metzgar told jurors at the start of the trial. 'It's not something you want to bring out at parties and show to friends.'

Metzgar's stepson Alexander King, 18, described a once close relationship that grew distant after the procedure. King felt uncomfortable having friends over and noticed his stepfather stopped showing up at school and sporting events.

'I was - I'm sorry - highly embarrassed,' he testified during the trial.

The device was ultimately removed in 2010 after tubing punctured Metzgar's scrotum. He received a replacement implant from another doctor.

The surgical implant most often used involves an inflatable device; two cylinders are placed in the penile tissue and these are connected to a pump in the scrotum.

When a man wants to have sex, he squeezes the pump in the scrotum and the cylinders are filled with fluid kept in a reservoir in the abdomen.

Penile implants can be:

Penile implants are not usually available on the NHS and inflatable implants are typically expensive.

The doctor's lawyer, Colleen Shields,  Shields, acting for the 
doctor, had told the court how that her client advised the patient to have the 
prosthesis removed after he complained of an infection and that 
the erection wasn’t going down, four months after the implant was 
fitted.

Ms Shields claims that despite the warning, Mr Metzgar did not act for months following the April 2010 visit.

A penile implant is an inflatable device consisting of two fluid-filled cylinders which are surgically inserted into the penis and connected to a separate reservoir of fluid, and a pump which lies under the skin of the scrotum.

The mechanical pump is squeezed to push fluid up the cylinders and, once full, the penis becomes rigid — a process that takes between five and ten seconds.

The erection remains until the deflate button is pressed.

A penile implant can be used as  a long-term solution for men with severe erectile dysfunction problems caused by a wide range of conditions including diabetes, prostate cancer surgery, Peyronie's disease and age-related vascular disease.

Metzgar had no comment on the jury verdict.

Ms Shields, said, 'We think the jury reached the appropriate verdict'
