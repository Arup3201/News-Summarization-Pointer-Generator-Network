President Obama admitted that there will be no 'quick fixes' in the fight against ISIS, after meeting with the defense chiefs of 22 countries to coordinate strategy on Tuesday.

After emerging from the meeting at Andrews Air Force Base, the president said the mission 'is going to be a long-term campaign'.

'There will be days of progress and there are going to be periods of setback,' Mr Obama said.

No 'quick fixes': President Obama met with the defense chiefs of 22 nations on Tuesday to discuss military operations against ISIS

The President added that ISIS presents a unique challenge to the coalition due to the influx of foreigners entering Syria to fight.

'We are going to have to pay attention to how all the countries in the region begin to cooperate in rooting out this cancer and we are going to have to continue on delivering the humanitarian assistance of all the populations that have been affected,' President Obama said.

No major decisions were expected at yesterday's meeting, as none of the defense chiefs are policeymakers in their respective countries.

Representatives from Australia, Bahrain, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Iraq, Italy, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates were expected at the meeting. 

Representatives of the Syrian rebels currently fighting ISIS on the ground were not expected as the meeting was for sovereign nations only.

'This meeting is to share our vision, discuss coordination and our common understanding of the way ahead,' a senior U.S. official said before the meetings.

However, one item the group did agree on was a name for the military operation, which the Pentagon is expected to announce as soon as today.

The name will be revealed once a document covering the entire mission is published by the Defense Department's Joint Staff.

Tuesday's meeting was the fourth - and largest - to occur in recent months between the nations fighting ISIS. The previous meetings took place in Jordan, Paris and Bonn.

So far, the president's strategy on fighting ISIS has been called into question

At the head of the table: President Obama spoke at the meeting amid calls from U.S. lawmakers to design a more targeted military strategy against the terrorist group, currently taking up large swaths of Syria and Iraq

Referring to ISIS, Republican Senator John McCain said on Sunday that 'they're winning and we're not'.

The United Nations said yesterday that fighting in Iraq's western Anbar province had forced up to 180,000 people to flee after ISIS, captured the city of Hit.

Anthony Cordesman, national security analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said the fight against ISIS 'hasn't gone badly, but it certainly hadn't gone well'.

He added that it was 'very important' that Obama had to show both Americans and other countries that he was 'committed' to the fight.

President Barack Obama will today meet military chiefs from around the world to discuss plans to counter the Islamic State, amid growing pressure for the U.S. to do more to stop the terrorist group

The news comes as it emerged the U.S. will send an army headquarters to Iraq for the first time in three years to assist local security forces struggling to resist advances by the Islamic State.

The establishment of a new divisional headquarters in Baghdad will involve about 500 fighters from the U.S. 1ST Infantry Division, with the majority stationed in Iraq, according to The Times.

Despite being expertly trained and expensively equipped, the Iraqi army is plagued by low morale and incompetence. 

The vast majority of Iraqi territory that has fallen into ISIS' hands only did so because the soldiers abandoned their posts in the face of a well-organised but massively outnumbered ISIS advance.

In recent days ISIS have pushed ever closer to Baghdad, seizing control of an army base in the strategic town of Heet, which allowed the terrorists to push towards the entire capture of Anbar province, leaving the Iraqi capital completely surrounded.
