Diary: The new guidance from NICE suggests keeping a diary of everything you eat to help keep those extra pounds off

They are pastimes that millions of us do every week to keep relatively fit and healthy.

Dancing, gardening and walking up hills are all well-known as simple exercises that would help to fight the flab.

But the health watchdog NICE believes we should be given official guidance to remind those who don’t bother - and that we should keep a daily diary alongside details of meals, snacks and drinks.

The watchdog warns to pay particular attention to lattes, high protein drinks, nuts and alcohol which contain hidden calories they may not realise they have consumed.

It is estimated that a quarter of adults in the UK are obese although this is projected to increase to almost two thirds by 2050.

The condition is thought to cost the health service and economy £16 billion a year through medical treatment, sick days and benefits.

Officials from NICE hope that encouraging adults to ‘self-monitor’ their activity and food intake will prompt them to adopt healthier lifestyles.

They are particularly concerned that the emergence of a ‘coffee culture’ in recent years has led to Britons consuming calorie-laden lattes and muffins on top of their meals and snacks.

Guidance also points out that many adults who do exercise underdo the good work immediately afterwards by ‘refuelling’ on high sugar sports drinks and protein shakes.

Additionally, the watchdog instructs parents to avoid giving children sweets at weekends, the school holidays or even for good behaviour.

Even in small amounts, they can ‘disrupt’ everyday healthy eating habits and lead to obesity, they state.

They also encourage parents to ensure children get at least nine to ten hours sleep a night as staying up late is linked to being overweight.

Other recommendations include urging adults not to drink too much alcohol as this also contains high numbers of hidden calories.

It points out that even if a woman sticks within the recommended safe limits of 2 to 3 units a day – a large glass of wine – this contains as many calories as Mars bar.

Don't undo good work at the gym by drinking protein shakes or high sugar sports drinks afterwards. 

Avoid calorific coffees like lattes – and the muffins and cakes that come with them.

Remember nuts and alcohol have 'hidden calories'. 

Don't allow children more than two hours of 'screen time' a day – which includes watching TV or playing handheld video games.

Have 'TV-free' days and go on a walk or cycle-ride instead.

Professor Gillian Leng, Deputy Chief Executive at NICE, said: ‘Overweight and obesity is an enormous concern for the health service in England, it has a huge personal health cost to the individual and the financial impact of dealing with obesity and its associated conditions and its associated conditions is creating a significant burden on the NHS.

‘A significant amount of effort is needed to lose weight and keep it off. This guidance sets out the many things individuals can do to maintain a healthy weight that are known to be effective.

Professor Susan Jebb, an expert in diet and population health at the University of Oxford, said: ‘In 21st century Britain most people are less active than recommended for good health and it is all too easy to eat more calories than we need – weight gain is unfortunately all too common.

‘The recommendations emphasise the value of reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods and the amount of time spent sitting down and inactive.’

The guidance also states that ideally, children should have no more than two hours screen time a day – which includes watching TV or playing handheld video games.

Parents are also encouraged to have TV-free days either weekly or monthly and spend the time going for a walk or cycle ride.

Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum said: ‘Finally NICE is getting the message, sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind.

‘Children, and maybe their parents too, will rebel against the advice that sweets should never be offered as treats on any day of the year - but both will welcome the advice long-term.’

Only yesterday the head of the NHS Simon Stevens launched an initiative that will very overweight patients referred for cookery classes and Zumba keep fit sessions.

Sessions paid for by the health service will teach adults to boil, grill and steam food rather than dunking them in the frying pan.

They will also receive vouchers to attend exercise sessions at local community centres or gyms.
