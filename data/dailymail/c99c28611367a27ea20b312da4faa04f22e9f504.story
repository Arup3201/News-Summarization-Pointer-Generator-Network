Graham Lockhart, 23, and Shauna Robb, 20, from Bathgate, West Lothian, were killed in the crash along with their two children, Tyler David, two-and-a-half, and Arianna Rose Sheryl, aged 11 months.

The family were killed when their Fiat collided with an articulated lorry on the A801 near Polmont, on the outskirts of Falkirk, at about 2.20pm yesterday.

Tributes are now being paid to the family on social media, by both family  and friends.

Mr Lockhart's sister, Sheryl Jones, said: 'To have you ripped away from us is hard enough, but to have all four of you torn away is just crushing.

'Never felt such pain baby bro. I love the four of yous with all my heart.

Nicole Sweeney said: 'RIP Graham Lockhart and his family. Too young to go.

'Can't believe you are gone, can remember us running about together when we were younger, such a nice guy. God only takes the best.'

Their car had crossed into the path of oncoming traffic before the crash at around 2.20pm yesterday, police said.

 from the scene showed at least five emergency vehicles, an upright 
lorry and what appears to be blue tarpaulin covering the car.

The lorry driver was treated at the scene for shock.

Superintendent Iain Murray said: 'This was a tragic collision which sadly killed all occupants of the car.

'We would like to hear from anyone who may have witnessed this crash, or who has information that can help, so that we can piece together the circumstances.

'We are particularly keen to trace a silver people carrier which was seen near to the site of the crash.'

The A801 between Lathallan and Bowhouse has been closed while police investigate the cause of the accident.

A spokeswoman for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said: 'We got a call at 2.25pm and sent appliances from Falkirk, Bo’ness and Larbert.

'We cut one person out of the car using cutting gear but there was nothing else more to do at the scene so we sent two appliances back and kept on the scene to wait for the fire accident investigation team.'

Anyone with information is asked to contact Police Scotland on 101.

Last night the road remained closed between the Lathallan roundabout and Bowhouse as an investigation into the cause of the crash was launched.

Police stood guard at the bottom of the road which was completely cordoned off to traffic.

In 2012 a 40-year-old man died after his Mercedes E220 collided head on with an articulated lorry.

Last year a lorry driver died on the road when his HGV overturned.
