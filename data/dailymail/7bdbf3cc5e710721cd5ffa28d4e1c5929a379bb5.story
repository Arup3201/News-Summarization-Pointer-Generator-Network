It's a $50,000 offer good for one 
weekend only. Friends and family members of Michelle Parker, missing 
from her Orlando, Florida, home since November 17, say they hope the 
massive reward will convince anyone with information to come forward.

'She's worth millions of dollars to me and my family, but I think $50,000 is an awesome amount,' announced Ms Parker's mother, Yvonne Stewart, as she choked back tears.

The 33-year-old mother of three vanished the same day her episode of the People's Court aired on television. On the courtroom TV show, she hung the dirty laundry from her broken relationship with ex-fiancé Dale Smith out for the world to see.

'Worth millions': Michelle Parker's mother, Yvonne Stewart, hopes the big reward brings back her daughter

Dirty laundry: Ms Parker disappeared the same day she appeared on the TV show The People's Court, during which she revealed many details about her relationship

An anonymous donor offered the massive amount for the safe return of Ms Parker, dramatically increasing the $5,000 that the family had been offering up.

Ms Stewart said she set a deadline for Sunday night because she doesn't want whoever has information about her disappearance to wait to come forward.

'We need her home now. I'm mad. I want her home. If you know something you know it. I don't think a day or two's going to matter. We're giving you two days, a holiday weekend,' the missing beauty's mother told WTFV.

'Oh the blessing would be enormous,' she added.

Her 
family also revealed she left a nine-second message to her father the day
before she went missing and wanted him to call her. They have also 
released new photos of her face and jewellery.

‘Hey
Dad, it's about 8:40. This is Michelle on Wednesday morning,’ she said 
on the voicemail. ‘I know that you're at work, but call me when you have
lunch or you have a break or the end of your day.’

Her father has said they had plans to meet up the day after she disappeared, reported WFTV.

The family released photos of Ms Parker wearing a cross necklace and ring, with hopes that someone finding 
the jewellery could lead them to her, reported ABC’s Good Morning 
America.

Missing: Family members reported Ms Parker missing after she didn't show up for work as a bartender at a local restaurant. Police later found her abandoned Hummer SUV

Spotlight: Michelle Parker was seen squaring off against 
her ex-fiancé Dale Smith on 'The People's Court' hours before she 
went missing. Mr Smith sued his ex after she threw away a 
$5,000 engagement ring

About 50 volunteers helped 
search for her on Thanksgiving across a two-mile radius from a tower 
where she last sent a call from her phone, reported the Orlando 
Sentinel.

‘I'm 
thankful that my sister has not been found in a bad way, because every 
day that doesn't happen, I still have hope that she's still out there 
somewhere,’ her sister Lauren Erickson told ABC.

Meanwhile it was revealed Mr Smith 
was dishonourably discharged from the Marines in 2003 following a 
reported string of court martials and military convictions for drug 
possession.

They had a 
'violent' history and he was charged with domestic battery, 
according to reports. She filed a domestic violence case and restraining
order against him in 2009, reported ABC.

In
her filing she said he 'smashed the passenger side window in my 
SUV' and 'took car seats out and threw them in the road'. She also 
alleged that he yelled to her: 'Your day is coming.'

'He
gets pretty malicious and vindictive,' she said of him on The People's 
Court, 'and he's a mean person especially when he's been drinking.' But 
her restraining order request was refused.

Searching: Despite their history, family members say Mr Smith is cooperating with police and that they don't believe he is involved in his ex-fiance's disappearance

Lack
of evidence in her claims of hostility was cited. Police have said that
he is not a suspect in her disappearance. However, new details about 
their tumultuous relationship are now surfacing.

'Your day is coming'

What Dale Smith allegedly yelled to Michelle Parker

Her friend Angela Launer told ABC Mr Smith was known to abandon her in out of the way places.

'I know he hurt her many times - dropped her off in areas with no shoes. Took off and left her in Georgia by herself,' Ms Launer, 34, said, describing their relationship as 'rocky' and 'tense'.

Meanwhile her mother said her daughter was humiliated by her appearance on the reality TV show.

Her
distraught family have revealed the impact of appearing on the 
controversial show, which aired just hours before she disappeared.

even ever want to see it. I wish I had never gone'

What mother Yvonne
Stewart claims Michelle Parker told her

Her
sister Lauren Erickson had suggested earlier that Mr Smith was an 
unlikely suspect in her disappearance, but later told Fox News: 'In my 
opinion, nobody is ruled out by any means’.

'Who
would want to hurt the mother of their children?' she said. 'I don't 
see how in any way he would benefit from it.' Ms Stewart told NBC: 'I 
know in my heart of heart that she's been carjacked.’

'That
the people saw an expensive car and a girl who looks like she has money
and I know they've made a mistake and I know that they want to fix this
and I forgive them.’

Dirty laundry: The People's Court Episode with Mr Smith and Ms Parker was promoted as 'Roller Coaster Romance Derails!' and included the pair airing the dirty laundry about their relationship

'It's
Thanksgiving. She wants to come home to her babies. We want her home. 
We forgive you. Please turn her loose. I know for a fact she's not 
dead.’

Ms Parker is the
mother of an 11-year-old son and two three-year-old twins she had with 
her Mr Smith. Thursday was a big day since the episode that featured her
and him aired at 2pm that day.

The
couple fought it out over the lawsuit he filed claiming she lost her 
$5,000 engagement ring when she threw it at him in a fight at a Hilton 
hotel during a science fiction convention.

Police
said Ms Parker has a 'violent' history with Mr Smith, though he is not 
as a suspect. In the episode, Ms Parker described being grabbed by him and having to call police after a fight.

She
decried their volatile relationship, saying that each of them needs to 
move on from their on-again-off again romance that has lasted since 
2006.

She added that the pair needs to 'grow up' and 'move on' for the sake of the three-year-old twins they have together.

Ms
Parker's family reported her missing on Thursday night last week when 
she didn't show up for work at 8pm at The Barn restaurant, where she is a
bartender.

'She's an amazing person and we just want to see her home,' Lauren Erikson, Michelle's sister, told WKMG in Orlando.
