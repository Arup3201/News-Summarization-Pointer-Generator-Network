A hysterical 911 call made by George Zimmerman's girlfriend today has been made public, where she claims that he pointed a shotgun at her face.

Samantha Scheibe called for help at 12.30pm on Monday outside of her home in Apopka, Florida, claiming that Zimmerman had locked her outside and was smashing up furniture.

At one point during the call, Miss Scheibe screamed at Zimmerman: 'You put your gun in my freakin' face... Get out of my house. Do not push me out of my house. Please get out of my house.'

Latest mugshot: George Zimmerman has been arrested again over a new domestic violence claim after his girlfriend reportedly called police following a confrontation at her home that involved a gun

Scheibe said that Zimmerman had smashed a glass table, threatened her with the shotgun and ultimately pushed her out of the house, according to an arrest report.

After pushing her out, Zimmerman barricaded the door with furniture and refused to leave, saying that he would talk to police by phone, authorities said.

Scheibe told the dispatcher: 'You kidding me? He pushed me out of my house and locked me out. ... He knows how to do this. He knows how to play this game.'

Moments later, Zimmerman called 911 from inside the barricaded house to tell his side of the story.

'I have a girlfriend, who for lack of a better word, has gone crazy on me,' Zimmerman said.

Zimmerman then said he never pulled a gun on his girlfriend, and that it was Scheibe who smashed a table at the home they shared.

He also told the dispatcher that Scheibe was pregnant with their child and that she had decided she would raise the child on her own. When Zimmerman started to leave, 'she got mad,' he said.

Seminole County Sheriff's Office Deputy Chief Dennis Lemma said at a news conference that Scheibe wasn't pregnant.

Deputies used a key provided by Scheibe to unlock the door and they were able to push through the barricade of items, Lemma said.

'She was very concerned for her own safety especially having the weapon pointed at her and then being pushed out,' he said.

Lemma says Zimmerman was compliant and unarmed when deputies came to the house.

Zimmerman was arrested following the domestic disturbance call. He
 now faces one felony charge of aggravated assault with a weapon and two
 misdemeanors after pushing his girlfriend outside of her house and 
destroying a piece of furniture in the backyard.

He is due to appear before a judge at 1.30pm (EST) on Tuesday.

 Samantha Scheibe is the striking blonde Shellie refers to as 
Zimmerman’s ‘latest babe’ according to one close friend of Zimmerman's 
estranged wife

Zimmerman was picked up by police in Apopka at the intersection of Topfield Court and Bonnie Drive shortly after 1pm on Monday.

The
 girlfriend in question has been identified by officials as Samantha 
Scheibe and she lives at the residence where Zimmerman was arrested.

The Orlando Sentinel reported that an associate of the Zimmerman family have confirmed that he has been living with Ms Scheibe for several weeks.

At a Monday evening press conference, Seminole County Sheriff Don Eslinger confirmed that Ms Scheibe was the one to call police.

'She and George Zimmerman were having a verbal dispute and at that time she indicated that he broke a table and pointed a long-barreled shotgun at her,' Sheriff Eslinger said.

'She was obviously very concerned.

'She was on the phone with our dispatch, communicating as much information as she could.'

Zimmerman pushed her out of the home and then barricaded the front door so that she could not re-enter, using furniture to block the doorway.

Ms Scheibe had her cell phone with her and called police. Officers were able to arrive at the scene less than four minutes later and made verbal contact with her outside of the house.

She then gave them a key to the home and they went in the building to speak with Zimmerman.

When they found him, he was unarmed and 'offered no resistance to deputies as they responded', the sheriff said. 

'Visibly
 shaken': Samantha was with Zimmerman when he had a showdown over their 
divorce in September. Shellie can be heard on the 911 call screaming 
'there's a woman in there!'

He added that Ms Scheibe was being 
cooperative with authorities and was still speaking with detectives when
 the press conference was held at 5pm.

'We're going to do everything that we can do to protect her,' he added.

The
 specifics of the altercation remain unclear, but the sheriff's comments
 suggested that at some point during the fight Zimmerman threatened her 
with a shotgun and then barricaded her outside of the home.

The Seminole County sheriff's office released the following information about the location of George Zimmerman as he awaits his bail bond hearing tomorrow:

He has been placed in this status (segregated from the general population) due to the high profile nature of the case.

Zimmerman’s cell is designed to hold two inmates and is approximately 67 square feet.

It is equipped with a toilet and a bed.

A mattress, pillow, bed sheets, and blanket are provided. 

It remains unclear what exactly prompted the fight, but according to the police report it escalated quickly.

'(Ms Scheibe) advised that she and George Zimmerman just had a verbal altercation that resulted in him breaking a glass table in the living room, retrieving a shotgun, and pointing it at her,' the sheriff's office said in the official press statement. 

'She was able to get to the front of the house andcall 911. As she approached the door, he ultimately pushed her out and locked the door behind her. He then barricaded the door with several pieces of small furniture.

'She was not injured and no one else was at the home.'

Sheriff Eslinger confirmed that there were two weapons found in the home.

WKMG reported that Zimmerman is not eligible for bail.

A
 local news reporter from WFTV cites an unidentified source who says 
that the Monday afternoon incident involved Zimmerman, his girlfriend 
and a gun.  

New look: Zimmerman has clearly lost some weight between today (at right) and his murder trial (seen at left on June 14), not to mention his growing beard

Zimmerman's
 former lawyer Mark O'Mara, who defended him in the high-profile murder 
trial, announced that he will no longer be representing Zimmerman and 
has no involvement in today's arrest.

It is clear from the latest mugshot 
that he has lost some of the more than 100 pounds he gained during the 
time leading up to the Trayvon Martin murder trial this summer. 

He
 is also seen with a full beard, showing that he has grown out his 
facial hair more than ever previously seen in his earlier mugshots.

'Just when you thought you heard the last of George Zimmerman,' said neighbor Catherine Cantrell.

She said she had twice seen a man who looked like Zimmerman get out of a truck that's been in the driveway for nearly a month. The truck parked there Monday appeared to be the same one that reporters have seen Zimmerman drive previously.

'I'm in absolute shock. He was never outside. It's not like he was out flaunting around,' she said.

Cantrell said the woman who lived in the home was very sweet and quiet.

Sarah
 Tyler, 26, also lives across the street from the tan stucco house on a 
cul-de-sac street of single family homes in Apopka, about 15 miles 
northwest of Orlando.

Scene: Zimmerman was arrested at his girlfriend's home on Monday afternoon, and his relatives told a local paper that he had been living at that residence for a few weeks

'It's kind of frightening,' she said, adding that she only saw a woman came out of the house.

This
 is not the first alleged altercation that Zimmerman has found himself 
in since being acquitted of murder, as his ex-wife called police to 
their home in September after he confronted her with a gun just days 
after she filed for divorce.

Police reported that no charges were 
filed against Zimmerman following the September altercation. Lake Mary 
Police said in a report released this week that there was not enough 
evidence to file any charges.

Legal troubles: On September 3, Zimmerman was pulled over for driving 60mph in a 40mph zone

Bigger issue: Less than a week later, he was handcuffed but then not charged in regards to a domestic violence called filed by his ex wife Shellie

Split: George and his wife Shellie, seen here during his murder trial, formally began divorce proceedings in September and she called the police when he confronted her days later

Police were waiting to see if images from an iPad could shed more light on the fight, but it was examined by a Secret Service agent who determined it was too badly damaged to get any information from it.

The dispute took place just days after Shellie filed divorce papers as she was removing belongings from the couple's home.

She
 said in court papers she separated from her husband in August, a month 
after he was acquitted in the 2012 shooting death of Trayvon Martin that
 gained her husband national notoriety.

He
 argued that he shot the 17-year-old in self defense after they got into
 a confrontation while Zimmerman was volunteering as a neighborhood 
watchman.
