The wife of a semi-professional golfer who shot her ex-lover after he entered her home unannounced covered up their affair by calling him her gay friend, a police report has revealed.

Mishay Simpson, 28, shot Andrew Noll, 23, in the chest after she heard him coming up the stairs in her home in Davis Islands, Florida, while her husband, Rhett Simpson, was out of town on August 19.

She called 911 to report an intruder while Noll called 911 to say he had been shot - and when Simpson later spoke to investigators, she claimed Noll was a family friend who had been stalking her.

Now a police report, which was released on Monday after the state attorney declined to bring any criminal charges, has revealed Simpson and Noll had an affair, the Tampa Bay Times reported.

Secret life: Mishay Simpson, 28, left, had a months-long affair with Andrew Noll, 23, right, after meeting him in a gay bar earlier this year. After they broke up, she shot him when he turned up at her house unannounced

Six months before the shooting, the mother-of-one had been out with her husband at a gay club in Ybor City when she met Noll, who worked there as a bartender.

She continued to see him, telling friends that he was her 'gay friend' - but his roommate told police that the pair were far more than just friends.

Robert Odom said Simpson visited their apartment several times and that once he heard them having sex, according to the police report. 

During the affair, they took explicit photographs later found by police.

Their text messages revealed Noll saying he wanted Simpson and his daughter to live with him, and Simpson responded: 'The day u change I will leave him for u.'

Simpson even paid for Noll's rent on his apartment, according to the report.

'The only person in Tampa that does not know about the affair is Mishay's husband,' Odom told police.

Affair: Simpson, left, is married to semi-professional golfer Rhett Simpson, right, and they have a daughter

But a few weeks before the shooting, Simpson said the relationship had to end and that Noll needed to start looking after himself - and Noll apparently wasn't happy about it.

Noll responded by calling her repeatedly and sending her more than 55 text messages.

A week before the shooting, Simpson sought an injunction for protection against him, the Tampa Bay Times reported.

The night of the shooting, Noll texted her again and Simpson responded that her husband was away and that she was going to bed - which Noll told cops he took as a hint for him to come over.

But after he arrived, he set off the burglar alarm. 

He headed upstairs, where Simpson and her daughter were in their beds, and when Simpson heard someone coming, she grabbed a 9mm Ruger and shot as the door opened, striking him in the chest.

'When officers arrived at the scene, they found Noll lying on the second story floor of Simpson's home with a single gunshot wound to his chest,' police said in a later release. 'Noll was transported to a local hospital with non-life threatening injures.'

Double life: Simpson told Noll she would leave her husband for him, according to a police report

Happier times: Simpson, pictured right with her husband and daughter, eventually ended the affair a few weeks before the shooting - but Noll bombarded her with text messages and calls and went over to her house

After the shooting, it emerged that Noll had faced multiple complaints from women for threatening behavior and even sexual assault, although none have led to criminal charges.

In January, he met one of his neighbors and asked her out, but she declined, saying she had a boyfriend.

He called her as many as 20 times and bombarded her with 39 text messages in which he called her a 'fat b****', according to a police report shared by the Tampa Bay Times last month.

Days later, the woman's brother was staying at her apartment when Noll confronted him and a friend and threatened them, adding that he was going to have sex with the woman.

The woman was granted an injunction for protection after she wrote in a court petition: 'I am in fear of losing my life... I am scared to even walk to my car.'

Scene: She was home with her daughter in their house, pictured, when Noll entered and set off the alarm one night in August. She grabbed a gun and shot him as he entered through her bedroom door

In another incident in March, a woman told police Noll forced himself on her after they went on a date.

But the case was dropped after the woman continued to see Noll and he showed cops texts she had sent him. 

In 2011, he was arrested for domestic battery after a man described as his boyfriend said Noll attacked him during an argument.

But the charge was dropped after Noll attended a domestic violence diversion program.

Simpson's husband Rhett Simpson is a PGA Apprentice in Palm Harbor, Florida and works at Innisbrook, A Salamander Golf & Spa Resort, according to his Facebook page.
