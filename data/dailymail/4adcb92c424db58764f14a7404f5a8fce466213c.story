Saudi Arabia has been pitched into moral uproar after a female spectator was caught on camera cheering for a Saudi football team.

The woman, dressed in a black abaya robe and niqab face covering, is seen shouting in frustration at a bad tackle during a match between Saudia Arabia's Al Hilal and United Arab Emirates' Al Ain.

As she shakes her fist in anger at the unsportsmanlike behaviour on pitch, her sleeve rides up and exposes much of her lower arm.

Saudi woman take a selfie at the AFC Champions League semi-final football match between UAE's Al-Ain club and Saudi Al-Hilal: There was uproar when a video clip showed a woman cheering on the Saudi club

A clip of the moment has already been viewed more than 400,00 times on YouTube, and attracted a storm of angry comments, mostly from men furious to see women watching the game.

'Women aren't interested in football, so why go to a stadium to watch a live match?' wrote one, in Arabic comments translated by BBC News.

'Does this woman not have a man? Her place is in the house,' pronounced another, echoing a general consensus that these women had ventured into a world where they don't belong.

Women are banned from going to football matches in Saudi Arabia, and had Al-Hilal been playing at their home stadium in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, there is now way they could have attended.

But the team were playing away at Al Ain's stadium in Abu Dhabi, where laws are not so strict.

The gender segregation laws in Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil producer and a key ally of the West, are based on a particularly extreme interpretation of Islamic Sharia law.

The absolute monarchy is the only country in the world where women are legally banned from driving and, until recently, voting and being elected to political office.

All females must have a male guardian, typically a father, brother or husband, without whose permission they can't travel, get a job, conduct official business like opening bank accounts, or even have certain medical procedures.

Laws are mostly unwritten, so the exclusively male judges have a lot of discretionary power which they usually exercise in favour of conservative tribal customs.

According to local newspaper reports, the Saudi government is considering modifying stadia with separate sections for women.
