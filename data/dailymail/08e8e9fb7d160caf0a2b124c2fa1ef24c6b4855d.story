Bill Clinton may have accidentally spilled the beans about the sex of his only daughter's soon-to-arrive child in an interview that aired this morning.

Clinton was casually chatting with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos at the Clinton Global Initiative's three-day gathering in New York when he threw out a hint about the gender of Chelsea's baby.

While responding to a question from Stephanopoulos about becoming a grandfather, Clinton referred to the baby as 'my grandson...' before correcting himself and saying 'or granddaughter.'

It's a boy?: Bill Clinton accidentally referred to daughter Chelsea's baby as a he during an interview that aired today

Realizing his mistake - or perhaps wishful thinking - Clinton clarified that he had nothing to reveal.

'No no no. I'm proud of my son-in-law and my daughter for not wanting to know,' the former president said after Stephanopoulous asked him if he had breaking news. 

Chelsea had said on Tuesday that she and her husband Marc Mezvinsky had opted not to learn the gender of their baby because they wanted to 'enjoy this mystery for, you know, the nine-plus months that we were granted.'

'And we are eager to find out what God will have given us,' she told CNN's Fareed Zakaria during a panel on Ebola at her family-run foundation's annual meeting.

Bill had already disclosed this week that Chelsea would give birth any day now, telling Zakaria in an interview that aired Sunday: 'I hope by the 1st of October, I’ll be a grandfather.'

Any minute now:  President Barack Obama joked on Tuesday that Chelsea could use his motorcade if she went into labor while he was on stage

Chelsea said Tuesday that she and her husband were waiting to find out the sex of their baby until he or she is born

We wanted to 'enjoy this mystery for, you know, the nine-plus months that we were granted' she said

One look at Chelsea this week made it clear her father wasn't joking about the nearness of her due date.

Even President Barack Obama joked during his remarks at CGI on Tuesday that if Chelsea went into labor while he was on stage, 'she has my motorcade and will be able to navigate traffic.'

Speaking about his future grandson - or granddaughter - with Stephanopoulous, Clinton later said he wanted 'them' to 'get up every day and look at the world with wonder and reverence.

'I want them to respect everyone they meet, whatever their background,' he said in an excerpt of the interview that aired this morning on Good Morning America. 

I want them to 'really love being alive,' he added. 'And when they grow up, I want them to believe they have certain obligations to people who don't have all the opportunities they'll have.'

The former president and his wife Hillary have an estimated net worth of nearly $100 million between the two of them.

Chelsea and her husband, a hedge fund manager, are also wealthy and live in a $10.5 million home on Madison Square Park.
