Roy Hodgson will attend the World Cup draw in July as England manager but with no assurances that he will be in charge for the campaign to reach Russia in 2018.

Hodgson is keen to extend his contract which will expire next year although FA chairman Greg Dyke has warned him that negotiations may not open for another 12 months.

'I get on quite well with Roy and we chat all the time but we have not talked about contracts yet,' said Dyke. 'We genuinely haven't discussed it. We will have that discussion in the next nine months to a year.

Roy Hodgson will be hoping to continue England's unbeaten run in Group E against Lithuania on Friday 

'When we decided in Brazil that we wanted Roy to continue with his contract, we thought: 'He's got a contract, he sees it through'. Sometime in the next year we will discuss what happens afterwards.'

The draw for the World Cup qualifiers is in St Petersburg, Russia, on July 25. Hodgson will represent England, but Dyke plans to dodge the event after reacting to a tough World Cup draw by making a cut-throat gesture. 'Roy will go, I'm not allowed after what happened last time,' said Dyke.

England, who play Lithuania at Wembley on Fridayare cruising towards Euro 2016 in France, winning the first four qualifiers to establish a six-point lead at the top of a group from which the top two automatically go through.

Hodgson will be 70 at the time of the World Cup in Russia but has proved a popular manager with FA chiefs and players alike since he replaced Fabio Capello, in 2012.

The Euro 2016 qualification process has been so tame, however, that a final decision on his contract may even be shelved until after the finals as England bid to improve on their World Cup flop, when they failed to win a game.

'Without being disrespectful, this group isn't the toughest,' said centre-half Phil Jagielka. 'Time will tell in the tournament. There is a bit of pressure on and that is when the judgment will be clearer.

'We need to have a good tournament in France to back him if Roy is going to stay on, but the boys are desperate to do that. He's a likeable person and a good man-manager.

'We want to play well and get as far as we can. We will be looking, and should be looking, to go and win the tournament. We want to keep progressing. We have a good, youthful and talented squad. Hopefully we can keep knocking out the wins.'
