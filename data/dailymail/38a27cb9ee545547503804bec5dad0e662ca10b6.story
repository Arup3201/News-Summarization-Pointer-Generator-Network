After years of examinations, theories and controversy, Leicester Cathedral officials have unveiled the final design for the tomb in which Richard III’s remains will be reburied next year.

They also confirmed that the coffin that will hold the 15th century ruler will be made by one of his sister’s direct descendants.

The remains of Richard III were 
discovered under a car park in Leicester city centre in 2012, but a decision on his final resting place has only now been decided after some controversy.

This handout issued by the Diocese of Leicester shows the final design for the tomb in which Richard III's remains will be reinterred next year. Leicester Cathedral also confirmed that the coffin set to be used to rebury the 15th century ruler will be made by one of his sister's direct descendants

Dean of Leicester David Monteith told a 
news conference in the city that the cost of the reburial project had 
been finalised at around £2.5 million ($4.25 million).

The approved tomb, which has been accepted by the Cathedral Fabrics Commission for England, features a large block of Swaledale stone with a deeply incised cross.

This sits above a dark plinth of dark Kilkenny stone, carved with King Richard’s name, dates, motto and coat of arms.

Unveiling images of the King’s final resting place, the Dean of Leicester said: 'This is a tomb which reflects the era in which it is designed as well as the solemn purpose for which it is commissioned.

Discovered: The remains of Richard III (pictured) were discovered by archaeologists in a council car park in Leicester in 2012. There had been heated discussions as to where the king was to be buried before the high court confirmed he would be laid to rest in Leicester Cathedral

'To do anything else would be a pastiche of a medieval tomb and would ignore the fact he is being reburied in the 21st century.'

The coffin will be built by cabinet-maker Michael Ibsen, a known direct descendent of Richard III’s sister, Anne.

Of the total project budget of £2.5 million ($4.25 million) the Diocese of Leicester will contribute £500,000 ($850,000) for central costs, fees, contingency and initial preparation of the Cathedral.

Private donations are also being sought for extensive capital works on the cathedral necessary as part of the re-burial project.

Richard III will be laid to rest at Leicester Cathedral (pictured) after judges said it was time to give him a 'dignified burial'. The site is just streets away from the car park where his remains were found

'We are now in a position to move forward with absolute certainty,’ the Dean added.

'We recognise that we are carrying out this responsibility on behalf of the entire nation and that the eyes of the world will be on Leicester at this unprecedented time.

'Our ambition for the scale of the re-interment events therefore reflects the importance of this momentous occasion.'

Richard III, whose remains were discovered under a car park in Leicester city centre in 2012, was killed at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485.

Richard III's has also been given a funeral crown (pictured) which was commissioned by an historian who was involved in the dig that discovered Richard III's remains. The crown is gold plated with enamelled white roses. There are rubies and sapphires at the centre of the roses representing the livery colours of the house of York

Distant relatives opposed plans to bury him in the city, saying he should be placed in York Minster because it was a wish of 'the last medieval king of England'.

But
 the High Court told the claimaints, who were part of the Plantagenet 
Alliance, there was no reason to interfere with the initial plans.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling condemned the Alliance legal action last month, saying it had 'taken up so much time and money'.

Grayling said: 'I have been very clear
 from the start that the decision to grant an exhumation licence for 
Richard III was taken correctly and in line with the law.

'I am pleased the court has reached the same conclusion and comprehensively rejected all of the claimant’s arguments.'

Richard was born in 1452 at Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire.

During the War of the Roses, 
Richard's father, Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York was killed and in 
1470, Richard and his brother Edward were exiled when Henry VI, from the
 rival house of Lancaster, took back the throne.

Henry's reign was short lived and during a battle the following year, Edward became king.

In 1483, Edward died and Richard was named as protector of the realm for Edward's son and successor, the 12-year-old Edward V.

Edward
 V and his brother Richard were placed in the Tower of London and after a
 campaign to condemn the deceased king's marriage to Elizabeth 
Woodville, the princes were declared illegitimate.

Richard III took to the throne the following day.

He
 was crowned in July and in August that year, the two princes 
disappeared.

Rumours spread the king had killed them to remove any 
threat they may have posed to his reign.

In 1485, Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond launched an attack on Richard III on Bosworth Field in Leicestershire.

Many of Richard III's key lieutenants defected and he was killed in battle. Henry Tudor took the throne as Henry VII.

It
 has been confirmed that Richard III had a curvature of the spine, 
although rumours of a withered arm haven't been verfied form the bones 
found in the Leicester car park last year.

Last
 year scientists discovered the king was riddled with roundworm after 
finding large numbers of the parasite’s eggs in soil taken from Richard 
III’s pelvic region. The find suggests that the king’s intestines were 
infected with roundworm during his life.

The coffin will be built by cabinet-maker Michael Ibsen, a known direct descendent of Richard III's sister, Anne. Of the total project budget of £2.5 million ($4.25 million) the Diocese of Leicester will contribute £500,000 ($850,000) for central costs, fees, contingency and initial preparation of the Cathedral
