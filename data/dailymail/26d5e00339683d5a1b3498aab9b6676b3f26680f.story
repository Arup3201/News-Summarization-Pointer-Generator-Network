Miss Greenlee's boyfriend Jacob Ferrero, 22, was arrested this morning and has been charged with murder and aggravated arson

The father of her unborn child confessed to investigators on Tuesday night that he had killed Miss Greenlee, authorities told ABC News, after they had questioned him several times. 

Her body was found in a shallow grave next to the Madison Christian Church, The Columbus Dispatch reported. 

Investigators believe that he chose the location at random but that it is close to a factory where he works.  

Miss Greenlee was reportedly three months' pregnant.

On Wednesday afternoon, Columbus police said the young woman had been beaten with a baseball bat and strangled.

Detectives believe that Ferrero killed his pregnant girlfriend on October 8 at their apartment and then buried her two days later.

Her mother reported her missing on October 14 but said that she had not been seen since October 8.

Her cousin Estellia Sheridan told The Columbus Dispatch that the 22-year-old victim had only been dating Ferrero for five months and that they had been living together.

Miss Greenlee, who worked in a local restaurant, was three months pregnant with her boyfriend of five months, a cousin said 

The 22-year-old waitress was found dumped in a shallow grave next to Madison  Church in Columbus. Her boyfriend, who police say confessed to the murder, led investigators to her body after two weeks

She said she believed that the couple fought a lot and Miss Greenlee had been forced to call the police on Ferrero after he stole money from her purse. 

She recently moved out of their apartment but then moved back in with Ferrero a week later, Miss Sheridan said.  

Two days after the 22-year-old disappeared, the apartment that she shared with her boyfriend went on fire. 

Ferrero told police that a dog had kicked a candle over but admitted to a fire investigator on Tuesday that he had started the blaze to cover up evidence relating to his girlfriend's death. 

The news came just hours after a vigil was held for the missing woman and attended by her parents, Douglas Greenlee and Winnie Chutes.

Ferrero is due to be arraigned in court on Thursday.
