Loic Remy showed his delight at Chelsea's win against Aston Villa by performing a bizarre dance in his hotel room after the match.

Paul Lambert's Villa side scored for the first time 11 hours through Jores Okore but still lost 2-1 after goals from Blues duo Eden Hazard and Branislav Ivanovic.

And former QPR striker Remy celebrated the win by dancing on camera, filmed by team-mate Kurt Zouma - who evidently found the performance hysterical.

Remy posted the video online and wrote: 'Because I'm happy!! #meandkurt'.

The 28-year-old was brought on for the unimpressive Didier Drogba shortly after the hour mark at Villa Park, two minutes before Ivanovic scored the winner.

Remy himself has had mixed success in front of goal since his £10.5million transfer to Chelsea, scoring five times in 18 appearances for the Premier League leaders.
