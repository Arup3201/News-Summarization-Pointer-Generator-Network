North Korea has been told today to stop 'provocative activities' after it test-fired 25 rockets into the sea.

The rockets were fired from an area located on the east coast and flew about 42 miles over the Sea of Japan, a defence ministry spokesman from South Korea said.

The ministry said 10 rockets were fired at around 9am GMT or 6.30pm local time - with eight more launched two hours later. Another seven followed, the last at 9:30pm.

Yonhap news agency also reported 25 short-range missiles were fired.

Seoul's military 'has maintained a close watch for possible North Korean provocations', the spokesman said. .

'We urge North Korea to stop provocative activities that will heighten military tension across the border,' the spokesman added.

South Korean troops have increased vigilance following a series of rocket or missile launches since late February.

The activity coincides with annual South Korea-US military exercises that started in February and will run until mid-April.

Pyongyang, capital of North Korea, routinely says such war games are rehearsals for an invasion, while Seoul and Washington say they are purely defensive.

North Korea has defended its missile and rocket tests as justifiable self-defence drills.

South Korea has called the launches a 'reckless provocation' - while Washington urged Pyongyang to halt the tests immediately, saying they risked inflaming regional tensions.

The launch came two days after the North's National Defence Commission threatened to demonstrate its nuclear deterrence.

Analysts said the comments could indicate the regime is preparing to carry out a fourth atomic test.

'Additional measures will be taken to demonstrate its might one after another as long as the US nuclear threat and blackmail persist as now', the commission said in a statement.

'The US had better roll back its worn-out hostile policy towards (North Korea) as soon as possible and shape a new realistic policy before it is too late.'

North Korea and its main ally China want a resumption of six-party talks on the North's nuclear weapons programme. But the United States and South Korea both insist that Pyongyang first demonstrates some tangible commitment to abandoning nuclear weapons.

The North carried out nuclear tests in 2006, 2009 and in February last year.

Analysts in Seoul said the North is now mulling three options - a fourth nuclear test, the firing of a long-range rocket or the disclosure of progress in its programme to enrich uranium.

Despite tensions over the drills and the North's missile tests, cross-border ties are currently enjoying an upswing.

The two Koreas recently held the first reunion for more than three years of families divided by the Korean War - an event that raised hopes of greater cooperation.
