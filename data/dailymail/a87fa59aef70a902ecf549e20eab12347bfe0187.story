A property tycoon embroiled in a High Court cash fight with his estranged wife is still worth £700m despite claiming he lost a fortune as his marriage collapsed, a judge was told yesterday.

Businessman Scot Young, 51, who is in a financial dispute with Michelle Young, 49, over his fortune, claims he is bankrupt with debts adding up to £28m.

But a financial investigator told Mr Justice Moor that Mr Young has in fact 'restructured his empire' and moved assets around in the wake of his separation from wife.

Burke Files alleges the property magnate is still worth at least £700m and claimed he has seen a note written by Mr Young about securing $4.8bn (£2.8bn) profit in Facebook. He told the court this note had been seized during a search of Mr Young's hotel room.

He continued: 'I have seen a Post-It note talking about a $4.5bn profit in Facebook.' 

But he said there had been no disclosure to add the Facebook profit to his assets.

Mr Files, who was asked to investigate Mr Young's finances by his wife, said the practice of moving financial assets around was 'not unusual in the least bit'.

He added: 'The money is a tool. It goes back into the system to be used. The velocity of the money circulation ... can only be guessed.'

Mrs Young says she enjoyed a 'very luxurious' lifestyle before separating from Mr Young in 2006 and estimates he is worth 'a few billion at least' and says 'there was a vast fortune hidden'.

She says she wants her 'fair share' and would settle for £300m plus legal expenses. She says she wants a £25m house and wants to live in Belgravia, central London.

Mr Young disputes Mrs Young's claims 
and has said he is 'penniless and bankrupt', a victim of 'financial 
meltdown' and 'hopelessly insolvent'.

Mr Justice Moor will have to decide how much Mr Young is worth.

The judge has heard that the Youngs, who
both live in London and have two daughters, separated in 2006 after 
starting a relationship in 1989. They have been fighting over money for 
several years.

Mr Young's current partner Noelle Reno told the court they have been in a relationship since since 2009 and are living together in a rented property.

She said the rent was about £4,000 a month and one of Mr Young's friends - 'named Nick' - paid the bill.

Miss Reno also said she had loaned Mr Young £25,000 and that she paid the utility bills and for shopping.

'I am not supporting him,' she told the court. 'I have loaned him some money. I pay the utility bills. I pay for the Tesco shopping.'

Catherine Thomas, representing Mr Young's wife Michelle said the £25,000 loan was in cash and asked why.

'Maybe he had an arrangement with the person to pay them cash,' said Miss Reno. 'Maybe he didn't want me to know who the person was.'

The lawyer asked why someone who was bankrupt would owe such a sum and suggested Miss Reno was being 'misleading'.

'I am absolutely not misleading you,' she said. 'I try to get involved as little as possible.'

She added: 'I am being persecuted for helping someone. I have my own problems. I'm being dragged into this. I don't want to know.'

Ms Thomas suggested she was a 'cash courier'. She replied: 'I have not been acting as a cash courier for Mr Young.'

She added: 'I know that he wants to support his daughters. It kills him that he can't. And he wants to support Michelle.'

But Miss Reno added: 'Nobody wants to do business with Scot right now.'

Ms Thomas asked why Mr Young 'can't go and get a job in Tesco?' Miss Reno replied: 'Even Tesco probably wouldn't want to get involved.'

Mr
Justice Moor has expressed concern about the legal costs being run up 
in the High Court cash fight and said he had no doubt that he was 'going
to be saying something' about costs incurred in the dispute.

The
trial - being held in the Family Division of the High Court in London -
began on October 31 and is expected to last several weeks.

'I have no doubt I am going to be saying something about the costs in this case,' the judge told the court today.

'It has concerned me, the amount of costs being run up in this case.'

The trial is being staged in private but Mr Justice Moor has given permission for it to be reported.

Mr Young's girlfriend Noelle Reno, pictured together at the MTV Staying Alive 15th Anniversary Gala at the St Pancras Renaissance Hotel earlier this month, told the court she loaned him £25,000
