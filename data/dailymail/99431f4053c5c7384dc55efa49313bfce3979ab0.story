A 12-year-old girl who gained more than 150lbs in tow years after having a rare brain tumour removed is improving after having a gastric sleeve surgery thanks to a crowd-funding campaign.

Alexis Shapiro underwent surgery at the end of March and has since lost 33lbs, and has reversed her diabetes, her mother had said.

The tween, from Cibolo, Texas was diagnosed with a rare brain tumour in 2011 and the treatment left her with a condition called hypothalamic obesity.

Then and now: On the left is Alexis shortly before she underwent the gastric sleeve surgery, and on the right just under two months later, having lost 33 lbs the change is significant

Alexis, previously a happy and healthy girl of normal weight, gained 151lbs in the space of two years, developing type 2 diabetes and other obesity-related problems.

Her parents Jenny, 35, and Ian, 34, found that their insurance did not cover bariatric surgery, so they set up an online crowdfunding campaign and managed to rise more than $86,000 to cover medical expenses.

Alexis went under the knife March 21, and in the space of two months, Alexis is now 33lbs lighter,her type 2 diabetes is 'pretty much gone' according to her mother and she no longer needs insulin.

At 203lbs, Alexis was also suffering form an enlarged liver, which led to what should have been a gastric bypass to be changed to a gastric sleeve surgery last minute.

Now, the dangerously large organ is substantially smaller and her blood chemicals are at normal level.

'I’m so happy with the progress she’s made,' Mrs Shapiro told NBC News. 'She’s the giggling, happy little girl I remember.'

Felling better: 'She looks healthier and has more energy,' her mom said. 'The other day she pushed herself to climb three flights of stairs'

Doctors hope the 4'7" school girl will
 lose as much as 50lbs thanks to the surgery, which reduced the size of 
her stomach to a quarter of its original size.

According to People,
 Alexis was booked in for a gastric bypass at Cincinnati Children's 
Hospital Medical Center but due to complications they changed tack and 
proceeded with sleeve gastrectomy surgery.

The 12-year-old still can't have solid foods and gets full very easily, but she is on the road to recovery.

'Of course she wants to be healed and done with everything,' Mrs Shapiro said, 'but each day gets better.'

The mom is posting updates on Alexis' shrinking size on Facebook.

Alexis' sleeve gastrecomy saw her stomach permanently reduced to 25 per cent of its
 original size.

Dr Thomas Inge, who headed the team of surgeons in the operating room, explained that they were unable to proceed as planned because Alexis' liver was too stiff and immovable for them to clearly see inside the stomach.

Inge said a senior surgeon went out to the waiting area and broke the news to Jenny and Ian Shapiro, Alexis' parents, telling them that they will have to go ahead with a back-up plan.

'They were not disappointed,' the doctor recalled. 'I think they were surprised that we had to go with plan B.'

The surgeons were able to nudge Alexis' oversize liver just enough to expose the left side of the stomach and cut away about 80 per cent of it, leaving a narrow 'sleeve' roughly the shape and size of a banana.

Young and fit: If Alexis gets the surgery she may be able to lead a normal life again and keep off the weight

'We were very pleased with the outcome of the operation,' Inge said. 'So it was not disappointing at all.'

While the hospital had announced on social media earlier in the day that the gastric bypass will take place at a later time, this afternoon Dr Inge said that the jury is still out on whether or not the surgery will go forward - it will all depend on Alexis' progress. 

He explained that while sleeve gastrectomy is considered to be an effective and increasingly popular weight-loss option, Alexis may not be able to lose as much weight as with a bypass.

If the 12-year-old does manage to shed enough pounds in the first year to 18 months to significantly reduce the size of her fatty liver, her doctors will evaluate her again and weigh all the pros and cons of a second surgery.

The operation would entail converting the gastrectomy into a bypass by connecting Alexis' small intestine to her stomach 'sleeve.'  

'I think she will have a new normal,' the surgeon said, responding to a question about Alexis' future.

The 12-year-old's father, Ian Shapiro, described the experience as a roller coaster ride for their family.  

According
 to her doctors, without the surgery Alexis would have continued putting
 on 2lbs a week and eventually become immobile despite a strict daily 
regimen comprised of diet and exercise.

If her condition was left untreated, Alexis soon would have tipped the scales at whopping 400lbs.

The
 weight-loss surgery, which diminishes the size of the stomach and 
shortens the vagus nerve that control appetite, will help the girl feel 
more sated with less food.

But the procedure performed on such young a patient is not without its risks, chief among them is the fragility of the metabolic system in children suffering from hypothalamic obesity.

Dr Inge estimates that his young 
patient will be able to lose 20 per cent of her weight - about 40lbs - 
in the first year after the surgery.

Alexis'
 parents, who also have two younger daughters, say they do not consider 
the surgery a magic bullet that will solve all of their daughter's 
health problems at once.

Miracle worker: Doctor Thomas Inge, from Children's Hospital Medical Center, led the team of surgeons who operated on Alexis

Mrs
 Shapiro says she simply wants her 12-year-old to be able to ride a bike
 like other kids, go swimming with her siblings and walk around without 
drawing stares from strangers.

The
 family said they have been overwhelmed with support from well-wishers 
from around the world, who have donated more than $86,000 toward Alexis'
 medical care, travel costs and living expenses through the Shapiros' 
online fundraising campaign.

Whatever remains of the fund will go towards helping other sick children, Jenny Shapiro said earlier this year.

Alexis' life-threatening condition was triggered by surgery she had two years ago to remove a benign brain tumor called craniopharnygioma.  

During the operation, her hypothalamus and pituitary gland, which help govern appetite and weight, were damaged.

She now feels constantly hungry and her weight has caused other medical conditions.

After her brain surgery, Alexis' parents had to take extreme measures to keep their daughter from eating herself to death.

'She's always hungry,' her father Ian Shapiro said. 'In the past, we've had to padlock the cupboard.'

'These kids will literally eat themselves to death,' Jenny Shapiro said. 'That's what I'm scared of.'

The
 outpouring of love and funds on the 'Hope for Alexis' GoFundMe page 
gave hope to Alexis, whose condition has caused her to withdraw into her
 shell. She is now home-schooled and has no friends.

'I hope this will be the beginning of the end of all of her 
pain and insecurities,' Jenny Shapiro wrote in a blog post. 'I hope she won't have to endure another day 
feeling like she is starving. I hope she will be able to think about fun
 things, not just when she will get to eat next.'
