Manchester City fans will be gratified to learn their new midfield powerhouse Fernando earned his nickname of The Octopus after a particularly stirring display against rivals Manchester United.

United were Champions League holders when they faced Porto in the 2009 quarter-finals, narrowly winning the tie 3-2 on aggregate after an extraordinary individual display from the long-legged midfielder in the Portuguese ranks.

‘The fans started the name because I stole so many balls from Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney,’ he recalls. ‘They said it was like I had so many legs.

‘Octopus has stuck ever since. I don’t mind, I get the same thrill from stopping a goal as strikers do from scoring.’

Powerhouse: Fernando could prove to be a shrewd acquisition for Manchester City

Pedigree: Fernando was nicknamed 'Octopus' after a series of superb displays for Porto against United in 2009

Fernando is one Brazilian who can defend which is why Premier League champions Manchester City made him their first signing of the summer by meeting a £12million buy-out clause while Arsenal were paying big money for an exciting forward like Alexis Sanchez.

Boss Manuel Pellegrini watched his side score 149 goals last season but couldn’t repeat their Premier League title success in the Champions League, which is the club’s holy grail.

Defeats against Bayern Munich and Barcelona – and losing twice to Chelsea in the league - proved to Pellegrini that holding midfielders Yaya Toure and Fernandinho weren’t strong enough against elite opposition, which is where Fernando comes in.

‘The manager told me direct that he needed a player that was good defensively to improve the team,’ explained Fernando.

‘City have a really good team. They are the champions. But I feel I can bring a better balance, defensively.

‘I get my pleasure from stopping the ball and passing it to allow strikers to score.’

In short, Fernando is the extra insurance policy City need as they attempt to successfully retain the Premier League for the first time in their history and show Sheikh Mansour that a £1billion investment deserves European success.

Toure’s reluctance to chase back with the same relish as he powers forward is well known. Fernandinho was exposed during the World Cup, particularly in Brazil’s humiliating 7-1 defeat against Germany, as someone who likes to go box-to-box rather than being a natural holder.

Quality: Fernando has already impressed for City on their pre-season tour

Brazil could have done with Fernando in the tournament but he wasn’t considered by Felipe Scloari, a consequence of an earlier indiscretion when the player pushed a referee during an under-20s international and received a long suspension.

The 27-year-old promises a similar mistake won’t happen in England. ‘I am a man now, before I was just a little kid,’ he reflects. ‘Unfortunately it happened and I wasn’t selected by Brazil after that.

‘It’s definitely had an impact on my career but it also made me more determined to do better and succeed. I am not the same young and fiery player now who loses his temper like that.

'My concentration now has to be playing for Manchester City but at the same time I hope my club performances here will open the door to playing for Brazil in the future. Of course I would love to play for them.’

Naturally relaxed and smiley, Fernando has been likened physically to a young Barack Obama. He has been learning English since January in anticipation of a move to City and been a popular “tourist” on the club’s current pre-season tour to America.

On Tuesday, he joined in a coaching session for local kids at a park next to the iconic Yankee Stadium, watched closely by former Newcastle player Warren Barton, now an American TV pundit with ESPN.

His back story is interesting. Unlike many Brazilian players who grow up in poor neighbourhood favellas in sprawling cities like Rio and Sao Paulo, Fernandinho’s childhood was spent in the eco-town of Alto Paraiso (Highland Paradise), known as Brazil’s mystical capital.

It is visited by thousands of tourists attracted by alleged sightings of flying saucers and other unidentified flying objects.

Surrounded by forests and waterfalls, it has become a major eco-centre with interest in hallucinogenic and other natural remedies that grow all around.

Fernando is a bit sceptical of the flying saucer brigade, saying: ‘It’s friendly, everyone knows each other and you can turn up uninvited to people’s house.

‘It’s very beautiful and we do get a lot of tourists. They try to find spaceships but I must admit I’ve never seen one!’

Solid: Fernando will not be afraid to get right in the thick of it for City in a hugely competitive Premier League

The 6ft destroyer nearly came to England a year ago when Everton applied for and gained a work permit for him on the final day of the transfer window.

But Porto grew impatient after there was a delay in Everton selling Marouane Fellaini to Manchester United.

By the time The Merseysiders had got the Fellaini money, Porto had changed their mind. ‘Talks were very advanced but at the last minute, Porto did not want to sell me,’ says Fernando now.

It’s clearly worked out for the best. This season he will step out for the champions. Despite the reputation of his hometown, he is rooted in reality and will be one of the first names on Pellegrini’s team sheet when the big games come around this season.

‘The target is to win the Champions League or at least to do better than last year,’ he said. ‘I’ve been in Europe since I was 19 and know the style even better than in Brazil.

‘I am excited because I’ve noticed that fans in England love players who tackle hard. That is my job.’
