The phone call to Tom Daley’s biographer came a few weeks before the start of the 2012 Olympics.

Chas Newkey-Burden recalls how a reporter from a red-top Sunday newspaper was on the phone, asking him about internet rumours that the then 18-year-old diver was in a long-standing gay relationship with a fellow member of the British diving team.

‘They rang me several times, looking for information about Tom’s sexuality,’ he told me yesterday.

Revelations: Tom Daley has revealed he is dating a man in a heartfelt video message on his YouTube page

Supportive: Tom posted this image with his mother Debbie on Sunday night with the caption 'So lucky to have such a supportive mum! I love you!'

‘It surprised me that someone was 
interested in running that kind of piece so close to an Olympics, given 
the effect any scandal might have had on his chances of a medal. I 
didn’t help.’

Sources close 
to Daley are understood to have also denied rumours of the gay 
relationship (which are, indeed, believed to have been unfounded). And 
no article ever found its way into print.

In
London a few weeks later, Daley won bronze. Touchingly, he dedicated it
to his beloved father and mentor, Rob, an electrician who had died, 
after a long battle with brain cancer, at the end of 2011.

Yet despite the outwardly happy ending, uncomfortable memories of the awkward episode have clearly lingered.

'He would be happy for me': Tom insisted his late father Rob would be proud of him no matter what

Indeed,
yesterday’s frank and fearless YouTube video, in which Daley declared: 
‘I’m dating a guy and I couldn’t be happier’, marks an effort to blow 
away a cloud of speculation that had begun to hover over his private 
life.

Daley, born in an 
unpretentious suburb of Plymouth, took up diving at the age of seven, 
and quickly displayed a precocious talent. Aged ten, he won a national 
youth title. By 12, he was beating adult pros.

Aged
14, he was selected for the Beijing Games, becoming the second youngest
male athlete ever to represent Great Britain at Olympic level.

The
achievement brought instant celebrity. But fame can be a double-edged 
sword: For like any other child star, he was forced to negotiate the 
hurdles of adolescence under an unremitting public gaze.

‘In
common with quite a lot of gay or bisexual men, Tom has spent his 
teenage years wrestling with his sexuality, trying to work out who he 
actually is,’ a family friend tells me.

‘In his case, that was of course made particularly difficult by the fact that he’s famous.’

With
a hectic media schedule, partly attributable to lucrative sponsorship 
deals with the likes of Adidas and Nestle, Daley was soon forced to 
become adept at parrying questions about his romantic life. He talked of
being ‘married to my trunks’ or ‘too busy’ for a ‘proper girlfriend’. 
On other occasions, he allowed rudimentary details of relationships with
girls to appear in print.

A
childhood flame from Plymouth was loosely hinted at. And a brief 
dalliance with US diver Mary Beth Dunnichay, to whom he gave a ‘proper 
kiss’ during the Beijing Olympics, was detailed in his autobiography.

Inevitably,
perhaps, his sexuality became a matter of debate in cyberspace, where 
Daley has become a target for gossip and taunts from those apparently 
jealous of his fame and success. But reporters largely refrained from 
raising the question in interviews.

Still as motivated as ever: Tom insisted that the new relationship has done nothing to stop his motivation ahead of the Rio Olympic games in 2016

Behind
the scenes, Daley endured a string of personal setbacks. In 2009 it 
emerged that he was being mercilessly bullied at Eggbuckland Community 
College, his state school, where peers called him ‘diver boy’ and 
‘Speedo’, and launched attacks that Daley’s family claimed had ‘a 
physical dimension’.

‘Though
Tom never said as much, I do feel that the motivation for that bullying
had a homophobic element to it,’ adds Newkey-Burden. Soon after, Daley 
moved to the fee-paying Plymouth College.

And
in 2011 it emerged that his father Rob had been diagnosed with the 
cancer which would later kill him. ‘Rob was a laid-back man,’ says a 
reporter who knows the family well. ‘I don’t know if Tom ever discussed 
his sexuality with Rob, but he’d have been very supportive.’

The
death left Daley, who has two younger brothers, as the eldest male in 
his family, and the major breadwinner (his mother Debbie is a 
housewife).

Former loves: Tom previously dated US diver Kassidy Cook

Romance rumours: He was also romantically linked to teammate Tonia Couch, but she later denied the claims

‘As a diver, 
that’s tricky, because it’s not a sport where you ordinarily make a huge
amount of money,’ adds the reporter. ‘So after the 2012 Games, Tom 
began to actively pursue a TV career, and to do that these days, you 
need a celebrity profile.’

In
August 2012 Daley began stepping out with another American diver, the 
Texan Kassidy Cook. He took her to the The Lion King musical in London’s
West End, and the Funky Buddha bar in Mayfair.

Late
last year he was pictured hand-in-hand with reality TV star Lauren Pope
outside a paparazzi-friendly London nightclub. A public flirtation with
singer Cheryl Cole, via Twitter, generated headlines.

And
there was no lack of female interest in his reality TV show, Splash!, 
which attracted six million viewers when it debuted this year.

Setting the record straight: Tom insisted he wanted to break the news in a video so his words could not be twisted and his fans would know the truth

'Not been an easy decision': Tom tweeted a link to the video on Monday morning

On
Twitter, however, there were unpleasant incidents of homophobic abuse 
which last year led to two arrests. His decision to ‘come out’ 
yesterday, with an at times very moving statement on YouTube, was 
overwhelmingly well received, with many praising his courage  and 
honesty.

The former Wales 
rugby star Gareth Thomas, who came out as gay in 2009, tweeted: ‘When 
the dust settles Tom will realise today is the start of an amazing life.
Congratulations.’

I gather 
that Daley’s management had been considering the move, at his request, 
for most of the year. Friends say it’s been on the cards since June, 
roughly two months after he began a relationship with his current 
boyfriend during time off from revising for A-levels (he achieved three A
grades).

Daley’s coach Andy
Banks was one of several members of Daley’s advisers consulted in 
advance of the move. ‘I responded in the same way many other people have
done,’ he tells me. ‘I just said, “Congratulations”.’
