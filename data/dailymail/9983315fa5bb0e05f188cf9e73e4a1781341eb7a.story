One is a light-hearted homage to silent movies, the other a gritty Cold War tale of espionage. And both will battle to be the big winner at this year's Bafta film awards.

Old rivalries will die hard as French film The Artist takes on quintessentially British drama Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy.

The Artist leads the way with 12 nominations but the adaptation of John Le Carre's thriller is close behind with 11.

In to win: Silent film The Artist, starring Jean Dujardin, received the most nominations with 12, including for leading actor and actress

In the running: Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy stars Gary Oldman as George Smiley

Leading the pack: Meryl Streep and George Clooney, who won Golden Globes on Sunday, have been nominated for a Bafta for best actress and best actor respectively for their roles in The Iron Lady and The Descendents

The two productions are both up for the most prestigious awards – best film, best director, and best actor.

Silent movie The Artist is being 
tipped for success after picking up three awards at the Golden Globes in
the U.S. this week. Set in 1920s and 1930s Hollywood, it stars French 
actor Jean Dujardin as a film star whose career collapses with the 
advent of sound.

Dujardin is up against Tinker, Tailor 
star Gary Oldman, who is nominated for best actor for his portrayal of 
veteran spy George Smiley. Brad Pitt, George Clooney and Michael 
Fassbender are their rivals for the award.

Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy has so 
far failed to be recognised with any awards in the U.S. but Oldman said 
it 'represented the very best of British'.

Emma Watson: Her Marilyn Monroe film has six Bafta nominations

Leading ladies: Michelle Williams, Tilda Swinton, Viola Davis and French star Bérénice Bejo are also nominated for leading actress

And now for the men: Brad Pitt, Gary Oldman, Jean Dujardin and Michael Fassbender have received a nod for leading actor

Other contenders in the best film 
category are thriller Drive, George Clooney's The Descendents, and The 
Help, set against the backdrop of the civil rights movement.

In the best actress category, it seems
to be a fight between Margaret Thatcher and Marilyn Monroe. Meryl 
Streep, who won a Golden Globe for her portrayal of the former Prime 
Minister in The Iron Lady, is tipped to repeat her success at the 
Baftas. She will go head to head with Michelle Williams, who played 
Monroe in My Week With Marilyn, which also featured Emma Watson.

Handing them out: Daniel Radcliffe and Holliday Grainger announced the nominations live on the award show's website this morning

British actress Tilda Swinton is also 
up for the award for her part in We Need To Talk About Kevin, alongside 
Viola Davis for The Help, and Berenice Bejo for The Artist. Dame Judi 
Dench is in the best supporting actress category for My Week With 
Marilyn, as is Carey Mulligan for her performance in Drive.

Jim Broadbent (Denis Thatcher in The 
Iron Lady) and Kenneth Branagh (Laurence Olivier in My Week With 
Marilyn) are among the five contenders for best supporting actor.

The awards ceremony will be held at the Royal Opera House in London on February 12.

Don't forget the supporters: Carey Mulligan, Jessica Chastain, Octavia Spencer and Melissa McCarthy are nominated for nest supporting actress, along with Judi Dench

And the boys: Jonah Hill, Kenneth Branagh, Jim Broadbent and Christopher Plummer are in the running for best supporting actor, along with Phillip Seymour Hoffman

Representing: Scottish film-maker Lynne Ramsay 
is the British name up for best director for We Need To Talk About 
Kevin, alongside Martin Scorsese for his first children's film, Hugo

Controversial: Streep has faced criticism for her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady, which depicts the ailing former British Prime Minister looking back on her life

Father material: Clooney plays a Honolulu-based lawyer in The Descendants alongside rising star Shailene Woodley, who plays his daughter
