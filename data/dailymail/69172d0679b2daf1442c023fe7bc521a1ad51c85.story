Forget letting renting out your home to strangers, now Airbnb wants hosts to invite holidaymakers to their dinner table.

The website has started a pilot programme in San Francisco so that homeowners can throw dinner parties for guests, charging whatever they like and sharing the proceeds with the company.

The US startup has grown into a $10billion (Â£6billion) business by letting strangers share their homes for a fee, but has recently found itself in hot water over reports that some customers are throwing wild parties and even orgies in the homes they rent out.

Tuck in: Airbnb is offering the pilot dinner party scheme in San Francisco

Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky told Yahoo News 
the site had banned 'thousands' of members for 
throwing wild parties, damaging apartments and even running temporary brothels in properties.

Disgusted: Ari Teman says that he discovered that his Manhattan apartment had been used to host an orgy after he interrupted the man who was organizing it

His comment came after New York comedian Ari Teman came home after renting out his apartment to find it was the venue for an 'XXX Freak Fest' orgy.

The New Yorker thought he had rented out his apartment to a family visiting the city and only discovered the x-rated party when he popped home to pick up a bag he had forgotten.

After sending a tweet to complain about the situation, Airbnb put Mr Teman up in a hotel, paid for damage and to have his locks changed.

The company has also come up against cities such as New York hoping to ban the practice of renting out private homes as violates an 'illegal hotel' law.

Amsterdam, Berlin and Paris are among the cities that are also considering a ban on private short-term apartment rentals for holidaymakers, which they claim drive up property prices for residents.

The dining program is an extension of 
Airbnb's hospitality empire, whose users have booked 10 million rooms in
 192 countries on its online marketplace since 2007.

Several
 startups in recent years have already applied Airbnb's business model 
to facilitate group dining among strangers, an increasingly trendy 
activity in urban areas such as San Francisco and New York.

Marissa Coughlin, an Airbnb spokeswoman, said the company is 'always experimenting with new ways to create meaningful experiences.'

Depsite reports that Airbnb was considering entering other businesses, including car sharing - it has stayed within the hospitality business, recently launching a pilot house-cleaning service in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco.

Airbnb told prospective hosts that they would have the freedom to set the date and price of their meals but warned that the pilot program was still in its early stages.
