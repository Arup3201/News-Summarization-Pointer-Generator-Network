In an emotional confession to some of his fellow wrestlers, WWE legend Pat Patterson came out and revealed that he was gay.

Patterson, 73, came out during a scene in the WWE reality series Legends' House, while seated at a table with wrestling royalty like 'Hacksaw' Jim Duggan, 'Rowdy' Roddy Piper, 'Mean' Gene Okerlund and Jimmy 'Mouth of the South Hart.'

The Canadian-born wrestling star said he'd kept his sexuality a secret for the last 50 years, but now says 'for the rest of my life, I want to be happy.'

Out: WWE legend Pat Patterson revealed to his former wrestling colleagues that he is gay

Champ: Patterson was the WWE's first intercontinental champion and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 1996

'From where I come from, when I had nothing, no family, no money, and I 
ended up with Vince [McMahon], working in the office, to me that was the
 biggest achievement of my life,' Patterson told his fellow former 
wrestlers.

Patterson then that his life outside of wrestling was more complicated than any of them ever knew - and it included a 'friend' of 40 years, who recently died from a heart attack.

'Sitting here tonight I'm going to say something and I would never want 
to say publicly, but being here with you guys, for once in my life, I'm 
going to be me now,' he continued. 'I survived all this being gay.'

Many of the burly former wrestlers began to tear up when they appeared to recognize how hard being gay in the wrestling world at a time when homosexuality wasn't nearly as accepted as it is today - especially given the industry's macho persona.

'I survived the business. I did, I'm so proud of me,' he said while wiping away tears. 'It's tough guys, it was tough.'

Patterson's announcement comes as homosexuality in professional sports is becoming increasingly accepted.

Last month, Michael Sam became the first openly gay man drafted into the National Football League.

In April, University of Massachusetts basketball player Derrick Gordon became the first openly gay man playing Division I college basketball.

Patterson isn't the only WWE star to come out as being gay - in April of 2013, Darren Young also came out.

Patterson was the WWE's first intercontinental champion. He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 1996.
