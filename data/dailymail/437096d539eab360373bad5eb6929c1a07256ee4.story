With interiors that are the handiwork of sassy lingerie designer Chantal Thomass, it's no wonder the rooms at Paris's Hotel Vice Versa are sensual, seductive and sometimes downright naughty.

All of the boutique hotel's 37 rooms has been uniquely fashioned by Thomass, renowned for her glamorous underwear creations.

Each of its seven floors based around one of the seven deadly sins, a theme that seemed obvious to Thomass when she was commissioned for the hotel, so guests can choose the mood they want their room to evoke.

Sexy silhouettes adorn the wall and intricate lace patterns feature on the bed-head in this creation by Thomas, famed for her lingerie designs

Thomas says she was more comfortable designing for the themes of lust and gluttony than she was for greed and pride

The entry and lobby is heaven-themed while guests can visit hell-themed hammam in the basement. 

Pink, black, lashings of delicate lace and suggestive female silhouettes represent the lust theme, with some rooms coming with a heart-shaped sink and a bodice design on the carpet.

For gluttony, a tea house theme is taken on with small teapot lamps hanging above the round bed with cushions that look like sugary macaroons. Sweets, tea boxes, plates and other representations of temptation adorn the walls.

Money, money, money is of course the order of the day in the 'greed' rooms that would make Gordon Gecko blush, with pounds, dollars, rupees and Belgian Francs among the worldly currencies on the walls and furniture that resemble safes in which you'd protect your valuables.

If money is on your mind the greed rooms with all manner of different currencies on the wall could be for you

Even Gordon Gecko would blush at the sight of all this money, which includes pounds, dollars, rupees and Belgian Francs

No grapes are to be found in the wrath rooms, which aren't for the faint-hearted with their red and black palette not the most calming of choices. Guns on the carpet and fittings complete a room where the darker end of the passion spectrum is explored.

Pride takes on a distinctly palatial feel, with marble columns, statues and blues with gold accents. It's all supposed to flatter the ego of the guest.

The most Parisian of the rooms come on the floor devoted to envy, where fashion accessories, perfumes, shoes and LED lightings you'd expected from a deluxe boutique store featuring.

And finally, good luck getting anyone to answer the door on the laziness floor on which the rooms aim for total serenity featuring blues skies, butterflies and flowers to evoke the feeling of a peaceful day in a perfect park.

Thomas had worked with architect Vincent Bastie, renowned for his work with hotels, on two suites and 'really liked it'.

'So, when Pierre Martin-Roux of the Compagnie Hôtellière de Bagatelle offered me a whole hotel, I jumped on the opportunity,' she said after Hotel Vice Versa's 2012 opening. 

'The theme was immediately clear to me: seven floors, seven deadly sins. 

'I had a carte blanche but with technical constraints, of course. It was not too difficult to work especially on Lust and Gluttony, with Miserliness and Pride, for example, were a real challenge because these universes are far from mine. I wish you happy sins for sweet nights!'

The fashion savvy decor in this room is designed to evoke the sin envy, with shoes, perfume and jewellery all prominent

Guests enter through the all-white lobby, which is of course centred around heaven

The downstairs hammam is Thomass's representation of hell, though after a scrub and treatment you may feel heavenly
