We reveal how to get the enviable physiques of the stars.

This week: Laura Dern's shoulders.

Actress Laura Dern's toned shoulders look to be the result of much gym dedication.

Laura Dern says she keeps fit through yoga, swimming and taking the stairs

The 48-year-old mother-of-two, who recently starred in the film Wild with Reese Witherspoon, says she keeps fit through yoga, swimming and taking the stairs. But, she adds, it's classes at SoulCycle (a fast-paced exercise bike class) in Los Angeles two to three times a week that keep her in prime bikini shape.

At SoulCycle, you work the arms and shoulders with handheld weights and perform core-engaging moves to music.

What to try: The overhead press works the muscles in the shoulder area. You will need a set of dumbbells or two bottles of water.

Stand with your back straight, feet shoulder-width apart, a dumbbell in each hand resting on the shoulders and your palms facing each other.

Extend your arms overhead, allowing them to rotate so that when they are straight, palms face the front. Keep your trunk pulled in and don't lean back.

Make sure you don't take the weights behind your head. Pause at the top, lower back down and then repeat 12 to 15 times.
