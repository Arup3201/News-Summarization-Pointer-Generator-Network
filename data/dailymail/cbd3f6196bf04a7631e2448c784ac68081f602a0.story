Two junior officers in the Indian 
army have had rape charges against them dropped after agreeing to marry 
their victim and her sister.

Sachin
 Gupta, 27, and Saurabh Chopra, 25, were accused of luring a 21-year-old
 woman to a hotel where they raped her and filmed the attack on their 
mobile phones.

The families of the two alleged rapists offered money to have the charges dropped.

Agreement: Sachin Gupta, 27, and Saurabh Chopra, 25, have had rape charges against them dropped after agreeing to marry their victim and her sister. The joint wedding took place at a temple in Bareilly (file picture)

However, the victimâ€™s 
family said their complaints would only be withdrawn if the two men 
married not just the alleged victim, but also her younger sister, aged 
19.

Once the deal was 
agreed, the joint wedding took place at the local temple in Bareilly, a 
city in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.

The
 bridegrooms were absent from the ceremony as they were not allowed to 
be released from prison until the marriages had been formalised.

After that, the pair were freed from jail.
