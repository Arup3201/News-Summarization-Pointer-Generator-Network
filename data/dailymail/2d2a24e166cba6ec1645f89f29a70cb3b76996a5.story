Britney Spears has struggled with her weight in the past but she now seems to have reached a happy and healthy medium as she prepares to embark on her first Las Vegas residency.

The songstress has been pictured looking toned and in shape recently. And the secret behind the 31-year-old's killer new body? A man named Tony Martinez.

The trainer, whose roster of clients 
includes Janet Jackson, Pink and The Jonas Brothers, works 
with Britney three or four times a week and said his workouts are all about having fun.

Speaking to E! Magazine, he said: 'I like to incorporate sports like baseball or basketball into my workouts.

'I like to have fun and light humour and have you laughing the whole time. We will get your work done but I want you to have fun.'

The man responsible for her 
transformation explained that he has made a few tweaks to her diet, which has left her looking much more svelte.

Speaking about working with Britney, he said: 'She is a tremendous athlete. She likes to be very strong and aggressive in her workouts.

'I kept telling her to stop making it look too easy. It was like a competition with us!'

Britney recently made headlines showcasing her super toned physique on the cover of Shape magazine.

Ever changing shape: Britney has always struggled with her weight and it has fluctuated a lot over the years L-R shows the star in 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2007

As well as modelling a range of yoga wear and pulling some difficult poses, the star also divulged the secrets behind her famed derriere.

She said: 'I like it, then again, I 
hate it. I’m in my 30s now, so I have to work harder to keep it "up."'

Britney credits yoga and the Nutrisystem- a weight loss programme backed by the Glycemic Index that provides portion-controlled meals in microwave-ready pouches - to keep her weight down.

But she did admit she still struggles to remain healthy at times.

'Dieting is tough…because my specialties are spaghetti, brownies and chocolate chip cookies,' she said.

Tony explains on his website that he uses the Four B’s plan with Britney. 

He writes: 'They include a mix of different exercises including sports, treadmill exercise, and ab workout.'
