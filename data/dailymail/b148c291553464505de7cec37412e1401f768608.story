For Susan Beatrice, her works of art are timeless.

The artist, from Sea Cliff in New York, has created a series of incredible sculptures that are intricately put together using watch parts.

The 52-year-old came up with the idea of creating works from the inner workings of timepieces while she was searching for recyclable materials to make her works from.

Having created her first pieces - a fairy and then a moth made entirely from gears - Mrs Beatrice decided to continue working with the medium.

So far, she has created more than 30 watch sculptures, with each piece selling for between $400 and $800.

Mrs Beatrice said that her process begins by finding pieces that she likes the shape of, before then trying to find other parts to build the sculpture up.

So far, her watch works include the likes of horses, angels and lions.

The artist said that there are still many other ideas that she has yet to explore, and that the project is on-going. She also takes requests to create the fantasies of her clients through watch parts.

Mrs Beatrice, whose sculptures take between three days and a week complete, said: 'I have always been interested in the beautiful mechanics of antique watches and other intricate machinery - I find the workmanship and precision inspiring.

Labour of love: Mrs Beatrice put together this romantic timepiece using watch parts

between three days and a week complete, said: 'I have always been 
interested in the beautiful mechanics of antique watches and other 
intricate machinery - I find the workmanship and precision inspiring'

'At first I was mostly interested in using the cases but the more I noticed the exquisite details of the parts themselves, the more I wanted to find a way to create with those, too.

'Since my first piece, the level of complexity in each sculpture has increased. I use many different adhesives and epoxies but I also try to use screws and solder parts when possible.

'Often I will use an existing intact section of a watch interior as a backdrop for the sculpture. There's no preset formula that I follow.

'There's just something magical about the scale of these pieces that fascinates people - like gazing into a magical realm that takes you to another time.

'In our disposable society, people seem to crave the ability to give gifts that become heirlooms. These pieces already have history built in and then they also become little art treasures to their owners.

'Conceptually, there is no limit to what could be created. The miniature scale is challenging but no more limiting than any other art material.'
