The police investigation into Jimmy Savile’s abuse of young girls has tripled in scale to 340 separate lines of inquiry, Scotland Yard revealed last night.

There are now 40 potential victims and 15 police forces investigating the paedophile BBC presenter’s reign of child abuse.

It prompted the BBC’s Director General to issue his second grovelling apology of the week – and announce a total of three independent inquiries.

Apology: The director-general of the BBC George Entwistle today issued a 'profound and heartfelt apology' to Jimmy Savile's victims as he announced two independent inquiry's would be launched

Investigation: Scotland Yard is now pursuing 340 lines of inquiry in the Jimmy Savile abuse case involving 40 potential victims, the force revealed tonight

George Entwistle offered a ‘profound and heartfelt apology on behalf of the BBC to every victim’.

He added: ‘I have made clear my revulsion at the thought that these criminal assaults were carried out by someone employed by the BBC and that some may have happened on BBC premises as well as, we now discover, in hospitals and other institutions.’

Celebrities and former BBC staff potentially face arrest for alleged sex offences as police hunt accomplices of Savile’s four decades of attacks. He is alleged to have raped and molested children as young as ten.

As well as the BBC, three NHS hospitals, a former children’s home in  Jersey and a now-defunct school in Surrey are accused of giving him free rein to attack children. Some victims have named people ‘around Savile’ as being complicit in his abuse.

Mr Entwistle revealed that police warned him last week they would  pursue ‘live active criminal investigations’ against suspects.

With more and more victims coming forward, the size of the police investigation has tripled from the 120 lines of inquiry being examined on Tuesday.

An old friend of Jimmy Savile, who worked with him to raise funds for Stoke Mandeville Hospital in the 1970s, said she was saddened by allegations of sexual abuse against him but never saw him do anything 'inappropriate'.

Sylvia Nicol told Daybreak: 'I am very sad, I don’t like it, it takes away 40 years of very happy, very good memories.

'Knowledge of all the good Jimmy did, because from the time he came to Stoke Mandeville I only saw him do good.'

But Caroline Moore has claimed she was assaulted by Savile at the age of 13 while being treated for spinal injuries at the Buckinghamshire hospital in 1971.

Nurses at the hospital are also understood to have dreaded Savile’s visits because of his behaviour and would tell children to stay in bed and pretend to be asleep when he came round.Of that, he said: 'It will examine whether that culture and those practices allowed him or others to carry out the sexual abuse of children.

Scotland Yard said: ‘We would once again praise the courage of and thank everyone who has come forward.

‘We have officially recorded 12 allegations of sexual offences but expect this number to grow.’

Outlining the three BBC inquiries, 
each to be run by an outsider, Mr Entwistle said one would look into 
what happened to a Newsnight report into Savile and examine if there 
were any ‘failings’ by management over the decision to cancel it. He 
insisted he knew of the abuse allegations only when reports appeared in 
the Press.

The second will look into the ‘culture
and practices of the BBC’ to establish if they enabled Savile to 
sexually abuse children at the corporation.

The third will be a broad assessment 
of the BBC’s harassment procedures, following allegations by stars such 
as Liz Kershaw and Sandi Toksvig that they were groped and suffered 
inappropriate behaviour at the hands of male colleagues.

The BBC will name who will run the inquiries next week, but non-executive director Dame Fiona Reynolds will chair all three.

‘The BBC will not avoid confronting the events of its past,’ Mr Entwistle pledged.

‘Jimmy Savile’s victims have faced 
years of pain. We owe it to them – and to our audiences – to understand 
how this could have happened, and to make sure that we do everything so 
that nothing like this could ever happen again.’

He added: ‘Despite our efforts to make
clear our belief the decision to drop the Newsnight investigation was 
taken properly for sound editorial reasons, people have continued to 
speculate. This is damaging to the BBC and is a cloud of suspicion which
cannot be allowed to continue.’

Victim: Caroline Moore claims she was a wheelchair-bound 13-year-old recovering from an operation to fuse her spine when Savile abused her during a hospital visit

Sick: Claims have also emerged that Savile, seen outside the cafe at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire, groped young patients at the infirmary.

Jimmy Savile penned part of a book warning children about strangers.

The
late DJ wrote the introduction to Benjamin Rabbit and the Stranger 
Danger, which was published in 1985. The book, which is subtitled 'what a
child needs to know about strangers,' is currently 'unavailable' on 
Amazon.

However, one copy is selling on eBay for £14.99

Asked if he would quit, or order 
sackings, if the inquiries uncovered wrongdoing, he said he did not want
to pre-judge them, adding: ‘The watch words are accountability, 
transparency and honesty.’

The developments came after a TV 
director who reported Savile to BBC bosses decades ago – when he caught 
the star having sex with a 15- or 16-year-old girl in his dressing room –
revealed he was ignored.

David Nicolson, 67, who had been a 
director on Jim’ll Fix It, said he made several attempts to expose 
Savile to the BBC, but was told: ‘That’s Jimmy’ and ‘that’s the way it 
goes’.

On Mr Nicolson’s claims, a BBC 
spokesman said: ‘We have been disturbed to hear these allegations. All 
staff past and present who have any information relating to allegations 
of this kind should raise them with the BBC’s internal investigations 
unit or the police.’

Grant Shapps, the Conservative Party 
chairman, told BBC1’s Question Time it ‘seems unimaginable’ people at 
the BBC were unaware of the child abuse allegations.

Savile also 
allegedly molested vulnerable children at Leeds General Infirmary, 
including a brain-damaged girl, as well as Stoke Mandeville Hospital and
Broadmoor Hospital.

In contrast to the BBC’s contrition, none of the NHS hospitals where Savile allegedly abused children has said sorry.

Among the latest allegations,  it was 
claimed yesterday Savile was banned from visiting a council-run 
children’s home in the Seventies after he molested a 12-year-old girl.

A
woman said he was told to leave the home in Leeds after staff found him
in a bedroom with the girl.

And former Radio 1 researcher Richard 
Pearson told Channel 4 News that when he met Savile once, he said he 
‘had just had 14-year-old girls’ in his trailer.
