Luis Suarez admitted his two goals that leave England on the brink of World Cup elimination were sweet revenge for all the criticism he has got playing in the Premier League.

The Liverpool and Uruguay striker has been banned for racially abusing Manchester United’s Patrice Evra and for biting Chelsea’s Branislav Ivanovic during a controversial career in England.

And after a 2-1 win over England, Suarez, who was playing his first game after a knee operation, said: ‘I dreamt this. I’m enjoying this moment, because of all I suffered, the criticism I received. So, there you go.'

Suarez added: 'Before the game too many people in England laughed about my attitude over the last few years. This is a very good time for me. I want to see what they think now.

'It was one of the best games I've played. It's an amazing moment for me. Maybe a few days ago I thought this wouldn't be possible.'

Suarez scored the winner five minutes from time after Wayne Rooney had cancelled out his earlier effort.

An error from Steven Gerrard allowed Suarez in to score Uruguay's decisive second goal with six minutes to play. Suarez said he told his Liverpool team-mate to keep his head up after the game.

'I told him (Gerrard) to keep going,' Suarez said. 'He's the best player I've played with on the pitch. This is an unlucky moment for him. I don't like it when he hurts like this. I said: "Keep going, forget this game, you're one of the best."'

Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez likened the game in Sao Paulo to a movie script with a perfect ending for his team.

He said: 'If this was a movie, people probably couldn't have wished for a better storyline, at least in Uruguay. We have won. We have beaten a European team after a long, long time. Many people said we wouldn't be able to do so.

'It's a special day. Both goals were scored by Luis Suarez, a player who was injured a month ago and had to undergo surgery, so this game was loaded with symbolism. But we can still fight. We're still alive. But we have not qualified yet for the next phase.'

The victory for Uruguay lifted them back into contention in Group D after a shock 3-1 defeat by Costa Rica in their opening game. Suarez and Co take on Italy in their final game next Tuesday.

England must now hope that Italy beat Costa Rica on Friday and also claim three points against Uruguay to have any chance of qualifying for the knock-out stages.
