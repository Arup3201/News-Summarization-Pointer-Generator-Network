Amazon is taking aim at Google and Roku with the launch of its Fire TV Stick in the UK. 

The £35 Stick is a smaller, more affordable version of Amazon's Fire TV box and can be plugged into any set with a HDMI port.

It comes with apps including Netflix, BBC iPlayer, Amazon's Prime Instant Video and streams music from Spotify and YouTube among others.

Amazon's Fire TV launched in the UK in October and costs more than double the price of the Stick, at £79. 

The Fire TV Stick isn't as powerful as the standard TV box, but many of its features are identical, including the apps available and its Fling function that lets people beam content from their phones to their TV. 

Inside the Stick is a dual-core processor, which Amazon said has six times the processing power of Roku Streaming Stick, and 8GB of storage. 

This is four times as much storage as the Chromecast and 32 times that of the Roku Stick.

The Stick comes with a remote control but it can also be controlled using the free Fire TV Remote app for iOS and Android that includes voice search.

'We're excited to introduce Fire TV Stick in the UK.

'The team has packed a huge amount of power and selection into an incredible price point - Fire TV Stick is just £35.'

Other Fire TV Stick features include Whispersync that saves and synchronises  video and music libraries across devices. 

Google's Nexus Player is expected to go on sale in the UK on Thursday.

A pre-order page appeared briefly on Amazon last week, but it has since been taken down. 

The device launched in the US last year and costs $99. It is likely to cost £80 in the UK. 

It has many of the same apps as Amazon Fire TV and Apple TV, plus a games controller from Asus that lets people play Android games on their TV.   

Users can additionally 'Fling' movies and TV shows from their Second Screen-enabled Fire tablet or Fire phone to Fire TV Stick. 

Once content has been 'flung', the phone or table can be used to control playback or volume. 

The Fire TV Stick will also mirror the phone or tablet display. 

A function called ASAP (Advanced Streaming and Prediction) will suggest films and TV shows that people will want to watch and buffers them for playback before a user hits play. 

And Amazon's X-Ray feature for for movies and TV shows lets people see information about cast and crew, the names of songs as they play, as well as a list of music in the movie or TV show, trivia items in context with the action on the screen, and character backstories. 

X-Ray is exclusive to Amazon and is powered by IMDb.
