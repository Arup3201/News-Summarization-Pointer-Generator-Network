Fathers4Justice campaigner Tim Haries has appeared in court accused of defacing a portrait of the Queen in Westminster Abbey

A Fathers4Justice campaigner appeared in court today accused of defacing a portrait of the Queen in Westminster Abbey.

Tim Haries, 41, is alleged to have smuggled a can of spray paint into the abbey yesterday before defacing the picture.

He appeared at Westminster Magistrates’ Court charged with criminal damage of more than £5,000.

Asked by the court to enter a plea, Haries, from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, said he was 'not in a position' to at that moment.

He was released on conditional bail until the next hearing, at Southwark Crown Court on June 28, but banned from London in the meantime.

The painting, by Ralph Heimans, which was put on public display last month, was damaged with paint yesterday lunchtime.

The work, valued at around £160,000 and called The Coronation Theatre, Westminster Abbey: A Portrait Of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, has been removed from public display for repairs.

Immediately after the damage was done, a picture was taken and the image was uploaded to the internet.

Haries allegedly shouted ‘Fathers4Justice!’ when he was arrested.

Chief magistrate Howard Riddle released Haries on conditional bail at the end of the 12-minute hearing, but said he must stay outside the M25 after police raised concerns that he would join an apparent Father’s Day protest in the capital planned for Sunday.

Haries was supported by at least one Fathers4Justice activist in the public gallery, although the group said the act at Westminster Abbey was not an official protest.

The portrait was designed to commemorate the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee and had only been on display in the Chapter House for a few weeks before it was vandalised.

Appearing in court wearing blue jeans, a black T-shirt with a yellow motif and a leather jacket, Haries looked relaxed as he stood in the dock.

He flashed a smile to a fellow Fathers4Justice campaigner who was sat in the public gallery with a sign which read 'No bail, hunger strike'.

Malachy Pakenham, prosecuting, told the court: 'The police have concerns that it is Father’s Day this Sunday and he seems to belong to an organisation called Fathers4Justice and they are having a demonstration in London on Sunday.

'The police have concerns, bearing in mind the nature of this attack and the demonstration this Sunday.'

Haries is separated from his wife, Jenny, and is in the midst of an access battle over his two daughters, aged 13 and ten.

The oil painting, by Australian-born Ralph Heimans, had been on show in the Chapter House for only a few weeks.

The portrait of the Queen pictures 
her in a moment of quiet reflection as she stands on the spot in 
Westminster Abbey where she was crowned 60 years ago.

Fathers4Justice was founded in the UK by Matt O'Connor, a marketing consultant.

Following separation from his wife in 2000, Mr O'Connor became a prominent critic of UK family law after a court barred him from seeing his young sons outside of a contact centre.

F4J's stated aim is to champion the cause of equal parenting, family law reform and equal contact for divorced parents with children.

It is well known for its campaigning techniques of dramatic protest stunts, usually dressed as comic book superheroes and frequently scaling public buildings, bridges and monuments.

Stunts have included supporters storming courts dressed in Father Christmas outfits, clapping the Children’s Minister in handcuffs, and group member Jason Hatch climbing onto Buckingham Palace dressed as Batman.

Artist Ralph Heimans said he sought 
to capture 'her humanity' in the 9ft by 11ft portrait, commissioned by 
the Palace to mark the Diamond Jubilee.

Her majesty posed for an hour-long sitting in the Yellow Drawing Room at Buckingham Palace in March.

Mr Heimans then imagined the dramatic backdrop – the Sacrarium at Westminster Abbey, also known as the Coronation Theatre.

She stands on the Cosmati pavement – a
 spot where every English monarch has been crowned since it was 
commissioned by Henry III in the 13th century.

Mr Heimans, said: 'I hope there is a degree of humanity uncommon in traditional Royal portraits.

'I wanted her expression to be open 
to interpretation so that people could imagine what she was thinking at 
that moment, but I think there is a sense of tenderness and soulfulness,
 as well as nostalgia and contemplation.

'But there is also a suggestion of her inner strength. She has an extraordinary aura and a real energy and presence.'

The painting is entitled The Coronation Theatre, Westminster Abbey: A Portrait of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.

A statement from the artist Mr Heimans was read out to the court in which he confirmed that the 11ft by 9ft painting was produced in 2012 during the Queen's Diamond Jubilee year
