38-year-old Kevin Norris died on Sunday night after being Tasered by police in a McDonald's restaurant 

His brother says he had just started turning his life around.

But Mr Norris's girlfriend said he was addicted to ice, and had been on a bender in the days running up to his sudden death.

'Off that drug he was so beautiful it wasn't funny,' she told the Seven Network.

'He looked after me so well.'

Officers were called to McDonald's Mittagong on Bowral Road about 8.50pm on Sunday after responding to reports a man was claiming he had been attacked

She told the Nine Network he had been on a three day ice binge and threatened to kill her before he left their house, ending up at the nearby McDonald's.

Mr Norris's younger brother, David, criticised the police tactics used.

'I don't think the sort of punishment he got was appropriate,' David told AAP.

'I've lost all respect for police officers.'

When police arrived at the scene, Norris - who was unarmed - got into a fight with two officers who were injured during the incident.

He was Tasered by police after he would not calm down after they tried to talk to him. 

He was then taken to Bowral Police Station and died a short time later. Mr Norris had just moved to Mittagong from Gunning, about 130km away, to be with his girlfriend who lived near the restaurant.

'He had problems his whole life, mixing with the wrong crowd,' his brother David said.

'But a couple of years ago he started getting his life back on track and doing well for himself.

'He was working every day, got a licence, got his first car.' 

Mr Norris was handcuffed at the restaurant and was conscious when he arrived at the police station, Police and ambulance officers tried to resuscitate him after he collapsed but were unsuccessful

Mr Norris was handcuffed at the restaurant and was conscious when he arrived at the police station, Police and ambulance officers tried to resuscitate him after he collapsed but were unsuccessful.

Assistant Commissioner Gary Worboys said CCTV would form an important part of the investigation as there weren't many witnesses.

'There's no doubt there will be footage from the fast food restaurant, indeed the police station,' he said.

An autopsy is expected to be carried out in the next couple of days.

'It is a tragic set of circumstances and our thoughts go out to his family and friends,' Mr Worboys said.

Police said CCTV would form an important part of the investigation as there weren't many witnesses

'And also to the two police officers who are recuperating.'

After initially stating Mr Norris had not been known to police, a spokesperson informed the media on Monday afternoon they had actually had previous contact with him.

A critical incident investigation has been launched.

Mr Worboys confirmed to reporters on Monday Norris was conscious when he was arrested but then 'slumped to the ground' at the station.

'Inside the fast food restaurant, it was a violent confrontation. Two police were injured and had to be taken to hospital for treatment as a result of trying to arrest this man,' he said.

'The two police received injuries to the head and [were taken to hospital].'

Mr Worboys said it was only 'short period of time' between Norris being Tasered and his death.

'He was taken to the custody area and it was there he slumped to the ground,' he said.

Police administered CPR on Norris with the help of ambulance officers who had been called to the station earlier in the night.

Paramedics were called while officers were at McDonald's and later met police at the station.

But it is unclear if they were there to treat the injured officers or the man in custody.

Mr Worboys was unable to confirm if Norris had complained he was feeling unwell while he was being transported to the station in handcuffs.

'The man's family is aware [of the incident]. It is indeed a tragic set of circumstances and our thoughts go out to his family and friends,' he said.

Mr Worboys said the officers who initially responded to the incident were now recovering at home.

He said they were receiving support from the police along with family and friends. 

A team from Cootamundra Local Area Command will now look into all circumstances surrounding the incident.

The investigation will be overseen by the Professional Standards Command.

All information will be provided to the Coroner who will determine the cause of death and make any findings about the events leading up to Norris' death.
