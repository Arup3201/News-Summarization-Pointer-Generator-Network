A Florida woman accused of stabbing her neighbor in the eye with an ice pick and then strangling him to death is claiming self-defense under the state's controversial 'stand your ground' law.

Angela Stoldt, of Deltona, has been charged with second-degree murder in the April 2013 killing of 36-year-old James Sheaffer.

The 42-year-old suspect also has been accused of abusing the victim's body and tampering with evidence.

Crime scene: Stoldt got into an argument with Sheaffer while sitting in her car at the Osteen Cemetery in Deltona in April 2013 

A motion filed by Stoldt's attorney, and cited by The Daytona Beach News-Journal, claimed that the woman stabbed Sheaffer as the two sat in her car at a cemetery because he was threatening to kill her and her children.

Even after he was stabbed in the face, according to the defense, Sheaffer kept coming at Stoldt, who was in fear for her life.

At least 22 states, among them Florida, have laws on the books that allow that 'there is no duty to retreat (from) an attacker in any place in which one is lawfully present.'

These laws generally cancel a person's duty to retreat in the face of a serious physical attack.

The 2012 Florida shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin and the acquittal of neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman sparked debate over 'stand your ground' laws around the country.

James Sheaffer, a limousine driver and a married father of three, had reportedly asked his neighbor, Ms Stoldt, to act as the payee on his Social Security disability benefits, but the 36-year-old kept overdrawing the account.

On the morning of April 3, 2013, Stoldt, with her two children in tow, picked up her neighbor from work and drove to the Osteen Cemetery after dropping the kids off at her parents'.

Husband and father: Sheaffer, who was married with three kids, was stabbed in the eye and then strangled; police were never able to locate all of his remains

On their way to the cemetery, Mr Sheaffer reportedly asked Stoldt if he could borrow $2,000 to $4,000 from her father.

By the time the two reached the burial ground, Sheaffer and Stoldt got into a heated dispute over the money.

‘Sheaffer said that he was going to kill Ms. Stoldt as well as her children,’ the stand-you-ground motion stated.

The limo driver then allegedly came at his neighbor swinging and grabbed her, refusing to let go.

‘She grabbed the first thing she could, which was an ice pick, to protect herself. The ice pick was in a box of camping supplies that was in the backseat of her car behind her,’ the motion stated.

The mother of two plunged the sharp instrument into Shaeffer's eye, but the man allegedly kept coming at her.

The woman, described as fearful for her life, grabbed a cord, wrapped it tightly around the man's neck and continued pulling until he stopped attacking her.

Ms Stoldt then covered Sheaffer’s head with Saran Wrap and disposed of his body.

The victim was reported missing by his father the following day, but it was not until nearly three weeks later that a suicidal Ms Stoldt confessed to killing her neighbor and led sheriff's deputies to various locations around Volusia County to help recover his remains.

Officials said they were never able to locate all of Sheaffer's body parts.

Confrontation: Sheaffer, a limo driver, allegedly attacked Stoldt while sitting in her car and would not let go of her until she wrapped a cord around his neck 

Investigators who canvassed Sheaffer’s Deltona neighborhood before Stoldt’s confession had talked to the woman on more than one occasion. She acknowledged being friends with Sheaffer and said she handled some of his financial affairs for him.

She told investigators that she last saw Sheaffer on April 5 and 15, even though family members hadn’t seen him since April 2.

The investigation took a turn April 20 when Stoldt’s sister called 911 saying that the mother of two was acting suicidal and had admitted to killing James Sheaffer.

The caller told the Sheriff’s office that Stoldt was hugging her children and saying goodbye.

‘Why’s she hugging her kids goodbye?’ the emergency dispatcher asked. ‘Because she came to the house and she told my parents that she committed a crime and that she’s being investigated for it,’ the woman’s sister replied.

Ms Stoldt initially declined to talk to investigators and was taken in for a mental health evaluation. But officials were able to obtain a search warrant to enter her house, where they came upon evidence indicating a crime had been committed there.

A short time later, Angela Stoldt confessed to stabbing and strangling Sheaffer, and then disposing of his body. Stoldt then led investigators to a location where human remains were recovered.

Ms Stoldt is being held without bond on charges of second-degree murder, abuse of a dead human body and tampering with physical evidence.
