Pictures have emerged of a mother-of-three who died after she is believed to have jumped from the back of a fast moving four-wheel-drive in rural Queensland just after midnight on New Years Eve.

Rinabel Tiglao, 44, has been named as the victim of the mysterious tragedy where police believe she may have thrown herself from the black 2014 Nissan Navara dual cab, which was travelling at 100k/h, at an unsealed section of Fitzroy Development Rd at Middlemount, reports The Courier Mail.

She was critically injured and taken to Dysart Hospital then airlifted to Townsville Hospital, where she died. 

Rinabel Tiglao, 44, posted this photo on Facebook in August in what is believed to be the same vehicle that led to her death just after midnight on New Years Eve in rural Queensland

Police believe Ms Tiglao may have jumped from the ute which was travelling at 100km per hour

Ms Tiglao posted a photo of herself in August on Facebook where she is posing behind the wheel in what seems to be the same black four-wheel-drive she was travelling in before the fated fall.

Investigations into the incident are underway, with the 39-year-old driver of the Nissan assisting police with their inquiries.

The car, as well as a residence in Middlemount, is undergoing forensic searches.

Detective Acting Superintendent Bruce McNab said police have serious concerns why the woman was led to jump from the vehicle.

'What we need to find out is what would make someone do this. We have grave concerns about the circumstances surrounding this incident,' he told the newspaper.

Ms Tiglao's nephew Jerdan Igot Tiglao spoke of his heartache about the tragic death of his auntie who had just visited him last year.

He said he usually heard from her everyday except for last month because she was visiting her family in Brisbane.

'She used to tell me every (story) in her life, ups and downs, problems, happiness, even secrets,' he told The Courier Mail. 

'She (was) supposed to give a call this first week of January but since I found out (from) her friend what (has) happened I am really (in) shock and don't know how to deal with it.'

Ms Tiglao's nephew expressed his shock at the tragic news of his auntie who he usually hears from everyday

Police are investigating why Ms Tiglao chose to eject herself from the black 2014 Nissan Navara dual cab, which was going 100k/h, at an unsealed section of Fitzroy Development Rd at Middlemount

Police are urging any motorists who may have observed the incident or have any information to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000
