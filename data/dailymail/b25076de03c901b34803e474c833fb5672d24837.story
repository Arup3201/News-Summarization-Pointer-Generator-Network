The West Indies Cricket Board has announced that its tour of India has been cancelled due to a pay dispute with the players.

The WICB held a meeting on Friday when it was informed that the players had 'taken a decision to withdraw their services for the remainder of the tour of India'.

The West Indies will not play the remaining five matches which were scheduled - the fifth one day international, a Twenty20 international and three Test matches.

India led the ODI series 2-1 after their 59-run win in Dharamsala on Friday.

The announcement ended a day of confusion and conflicting statements where the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced midway through the hosts' innings that the tour was to end, saying it was 'shocked and extremely disappointed at the decision taken by the WICB'.

This was initially contradicted by the WICB, before a further statement was then issued by the BCCI documenting a full timeline of the WICB's withdrawal from the tour. 

Bravo said the team was behind him and he did not want cricket to suffer as a result of the West Indies quitting

Following a board meeting on Friday evening, the WICB confirmed the tour was over and in a statement released on the board's website, apologised 'unreservedly' for the early ending of the tour. The West Indies board offered to field a replacement team for the final five matches of the tour but said that 'was not considered acceptable' by the BCCI.

The West Indies team have been in dispute with the West Indies Players Association (WIPA) over the signing of a new collective bargaining agreement and memorandum of understanding (MoU), which would see sponsorship payments reallocated to fund the wider professional game in the islands.

The WICB said it warned the BCCI about possible player action and a delegation was due to arrive on Monday to meet the players and discuss their concerns.

'The WICB regrets that the delegation which was pre-scheduled to travel to India to meet with the players on a number of issues will no longer be able to conduct such a meeting,' the statement read.

The board has also accused captain Dwayne Bravo of using 'inflammatory language' in a complaint which was issued to the WIPA chief Wavell Hinds, which the WICB says read: 'Please note that we are giving you the opportunity to right this wrong before things deteriorate [sic] to such an extent that West Indies cricket to the wider cricket world looks to fall to its knees again.'

The WICB says it will now hold an emergency meeting on Tuesday 'to conduct a thorough assessment of all the ramifications of the premature end to the tour'.

India have lined up Sri Lanka as replacement opposition and will play them in a five-match one day series.

Team representative Bravo said his teammates were behind him in the decision to quit the tour of India
