A 77-year-old woman who was branded the 'Black Widow' after her two ex-husbands died under suspicious circumstances has been arrested for the attempted murder of her latest husband, who she is accused of trying to poison.

Melissa Ann Friedrich was arrested on Monday in Nova Scotia, Canada, after her husband Fred Weeks, 75, was taken to hospital.

He mysteriously fell ill after the couple checked in to Chamber's Guest House Bed and Breakfast in North Sydney on Friday morning.

Ashamed: Friedrich leaves a Cape Breton Regional Police Services vehicle escorted by Const Erin Donovan, left, and Const Geoff MacLeod for a court appearance at the Sydney Justice Centre on Tuesday

Cheryl Chambers said Friedrich told 
her the couple had traveled to Cape Breton and her husband wasn't well 
because of a rough ferry crossing.

Paramedics were called on Saturday morning. Her husband has since been released.

'We were called on Sunday by the hospital,' said Desiree 
Vassallo, spokeswoman for the Cape Breton Regional Police. 'The hospital
had some concerns about a patient that had been admitted, displaying 
strange symptoms.'

Friedrich has already spent time 
in jail both for the death of her first husband, who she ran over and is
also suspected of poisoning, and for stealing thousand of dollars from 
an ailing Pinellas Park man in 2005, who she met on the internet.

Alex Strategos met Friedrich on the internet in 2004: Just hours after the couple got together, Strategos began feeling dizzy and was hospitalized half a dozen times

First husband: Friedrich spent two years of a six-year term in prison in 1992 after she was convicted in the manslaughter of Gordon Stewart, from Halifax, they had been married just one year

She served four years in a Florida prison after pleading guilty to 
multiple charges of grand theft and forgery.

She is also accused of trying to poison him and has a number of fraud convictions.

Friedrich spent two years of a six-year prison term in jail in 1992 after she 
was convicted in the manslaughter of her first husband Gordon Stewart, 
from Halifax. They had been married just one year.

She claimed 
he had raped her and she accidentally ran over him while trying to 
escape.

In 2000, she met 83-year-old Robert 
Edmund Friedrich of Florida. They got engaged three days later and it 
wasn't long before his health started to deteriorate.

He died two years later by which time more than $400,000 was taken from his bank account.

His
family suspect he was drugged by Friedrich but an autopsy was never 
done because of his poor health. His wife had him cremated.

According to the Tampa Bay Times, in 2004, the 77-year-old 
left Canada and moved into the Pinellas Park home of Alex Strategos 
after the pair met on the Internet. 

It was only hours after they got together Strategos started complaining of feeling dizzy. He was hospitalized half a 
dozen times.

It was only when his son noticed almost $20,000 was missing from his father's bank account that he called police.

A test of Strategos' blood showed signs of a 
tranquilizer but police were unable to prove that Friedrich drugged him.

Speaking of his ex-wife's current arrest the now 81-year-old said he was 'speechless'.

A neighbor at the New Glasgow apartment the Weeks' lived in said they had a fast courtship, as well as claiming the 'Black Widow' had tried to pursue a relationship with her.

Pauline Chapman told the Huffington Post, Canada, that she had spoken with Friedrich a few times since she moved into the complex about a year ago.

'It was a quick relationship. I was away for a couple days and I come home and I heard they had married,' she said.

'She always went to Christian fellowship and she wanted to pursue a relationship with me and I just kind of backed off.'
