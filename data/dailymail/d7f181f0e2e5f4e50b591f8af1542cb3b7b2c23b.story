Embarrassment: Christopher Thorpe pleaded guilty to misconduct in 2001

A UKIP candidate standing in today’s local council elections was forced to resign as a police officer after he was caught working as a male escort in full uniform, it emerged last night.

Christopher Thorpe, 50, who is the latest candidate to cause embarrassment for the party, lost his job with Hertfordshire Police after he pleaded guilty to misconduct in 2001.

Mr Thorpe, who is standing in the Hertfordshire County Council elections, had been caught advertising as a male escort and was hired by a national newspaper to perform at a hen party.

He turned up in his police uniform and stripped to his boxer shorts before offering to have sex will all seven women in attendance.

While being booked, he had bragged that there were ‘no limits’ to what he would do for the £100 fee.

Mr Thorpe, who is a stay-at-home father from St Albans, last night refused to stand down as a candidate as he insisted that it should not prevent him from standing for public office.

He said: ‘I think we have had enough of manufactured politicians.

‘I think people should come from all different backgrounds. We only have to look in the Conservative Party; there are one or two criminals.’

He added: ‘That is all totally behind me, it was more than a decade ago. I was a PC for my local village in Colney Heath so people remember these things and when you want to do something else with your life they think it is a good idea to run you down.’

He claimed that the hen party, which was organised by the Sunday People, was a one-off and that his details had been added to an escorting website as a prank.

He said: ‘I regret that they phoned me and that they organised it and that I went. It is not something I ever plan on repeating.

‘You go along thinking it will be a laugh and it ends up being an overblown situation.’

Claiming that he had never been a 
full-time escort, he added: ‘Look at me now. I wasn't built to be an 
escort back then and I'm not built to be an escort now.’

Mr
Thorpe said he feels he would have been approved by UKIP as a candidate
even if the vetting process was more stringent. He said: ‘Everybody 
makes mistakes in their past and I think Nigel Farage is a guy with 
common sense and while this is embarrassing to me I don't see why it's 
embarrassing to UKIP.’

Hertfordshire Police has confirmed that Mr Thorpe pleaded guilty to misconduct following an investigation and subsequently lost an appeal against a decision that required him to resign.

Chris Brazier, a Liberal Democrat who is also standing for the seat in The Colneys, said: ‘I was shocked when I heard he was standing. Other people have contacted me and said “Why is he standing?”.

‘There must be a vetting in UKIP for politicians. I am vetted in the Liberal Democrats and they say ‘Is there anything that would embarrass the party?’

When contacted for a comment, a UKIP spokesman laughed and said: ‘That’s magnificent. Thank you.’

He added: ‘Mr Thorpe is well known in his division, and we are sure the people of the Colneys are quite able to make up their own mind as to whether he will make an effective county councillor.’

Mr Thorpe is currently married to his third wife. He has two-year-old child, as well as two older children from his previous marriages.

He is the latest on a growing list of UKIP candidates who have made headlines for the wrong reasons.Others have been caught making Nazi salutes, wearing a Jimmy Savile mask and blaming the Holocaust on Jews.
