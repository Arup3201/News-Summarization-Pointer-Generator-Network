From a snowy Christmas lunch in Antarctica to the spectacular light projections currently brightening the facade of Sydney's St Mary's cathedral, the world is gearing up for Christmas in style.

But for festive fun, little compares to London's very own Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park, which, as these stunning images reveal, comes with lashings of Christmas cheer.

Also enjoying a spot of festive cheer were the crew of HMS Protector, a Royal Navy ice patrol ship, who stopped for an early Christmas lunch on an Antarctic ice floe.

Festive fun: The crew of HMS Protector, an ice patrol ship, tuck into an early Christmas lunch while sitting on an Antarctic ice floe. Lunch was followed by a football match

Working holiday: The crew were forced to have their celebrations early because the ship will be at sea on Christmas Day which means there will be no time to celebrate

Record attempt: Chefs in Ham, a village in France's Picardie region attempted to break the Guinness World Record for the planet's longest Yule Log

Although the ship will be at sea on Wednesday - leaving no time for Christmas fun - Captain Rhett Hatcher allowed his crew time off for a roast turkey dinner in a real-life winter wonderland and a game of football.

Captain Hatcher said: 'Spending Christmas in the coldest, windiest and driest place on earth comes with a number of challenges but it is a truly unique privilege.'

Closer to home, a group of intrepid French pastry chefs attempted to break the record for world's longest Christmas log in the northern French commune of Ham in the French Picardie region.

Equally tasty were the offerings of traders at the Winter Wonderland in London's Hyde Park, who enjoyed a bumper day as shoppers ventured out in search of the perfect present.

The temporary, festive theme park runs for over six weeks and features an ice rink, several large rides and numerous food and gift stalls.

Tasty: The chefs have to beat the Shanghai Pudong Shangri-La, which in 2011, created a new Guinness World Record with a 1068-metre long Yule log

Festive: A trader serves up a selection of beautifully decorated gingerbread hearts at Winter Wonderland in London's Hyde Park

Sparkling: The historic park has been transformed into a festive paradise complete with a neon ferris wheel, an ice rink and a miniature train set

Tasty treat: A warmly wrapped up couple inspect the colourful penny sweets on display at one large stand at Hyde Park's Winter Wonderland

Spectacular: Winter Wonderland has become an annual tradition and continues until January 5th 2014, although it is closed on Christmas Day

Further north, Bradford residents were enjoying the 18 Christmas-themed ice sculptures which were installed at City Park, Bradford, by artist Jamie Wardley earlier this month.

Among them are characters from Wardley's own story, The Children of the Snow and the Boy with the Little Idea, and a life-sized sleigh complete with elves.

In Country Durham, the Beamish Open Air Museum got a festive makeover, complete with lights for its collection of vintage trams and buses.

A working steam carousel turned under the cover of darkness, while Santa Claus answered children's wishes in his fireside grotto.  

But perhaps most spectacular of all were the light images that appeared on the side of St Mary's cathedral in Sydney.

Entitled Lights of Christmas, the light show includes projections of stunningly detailed biblical scenes, a portrait of Mary and baby Jesus and a gorgeous starry night.
