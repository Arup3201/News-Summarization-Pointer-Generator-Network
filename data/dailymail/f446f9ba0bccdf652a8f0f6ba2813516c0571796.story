La Liga champions Atletico Madrid were stunned by a vibrant Valencia side who scored three goals in the first 13 minutes.

Los Che came flying out of the blocks at the Mestalla and made Diego Simeone's Atletico, which had been so disciplined in their defeat of Juventus in midweek, look like lambs to the slaughter.

Perhaps that crunching battle against the Italian giants had drained them, for they were all at sea here.

A missed penalty and a disallowed goal could have earned Atletico a point but it would have been far more than they deserved.

Simeone, who has only recently returned to the touchline from his suspension, was helpless to do anything as his usually well-organised back-line crumbled to pieces.

Joao Miranda was the chief culprit, with the Brazilian centre-back heading the ball past his goalkeeper from about 12 yards out.

Shkodran Mustafi had pinged a long ball into the box and Miguel Angel Moya, once of Valencia himself, rushed out to catch it.

But Miranda was not paying attention and, despite being under no pressure, reached it first and nodded the ball out of Moya's reach and into the net.

Just one minute later, the lead had been doubled. Perhaps Miranda was shell-shocked, but he did nothing to prevent Andre Gomes slicing through the defence and drilling the ball inside the near post.

Despite his lack of pressure it was still a brilliant goal by Valencia, with Paco Alcacer's cute flick allowing Gomes to use his momentum and burst into the box.

So far, so bad for Atletico. As they fought to regain their stability, the conceded again and this time from a set piece.

This in itself is a rarity; Atletico are exceptionally good from dead ball situations, both in attack and defence.

They have scored 10 of their 17 goals this season from set-pieces, while they rarely ship goals in those situations.

Yet after 13 minutes Pablo Piatti whipped in a corner and Nicolas Otamendi snuck in and headed it home.

Late last season Atletico made the trip to Valencia when they were trying to seal the title and fight off the challenge of Real Madrid and Barcelona.

They earned a 1-0 win, thanks to a Raul Garcia header, with a traditionally steely peformance. The forward was not selected for this game, after his exploits against Juventus in the Champions League.

Simeone would have wanted more of the same this time around, particularly considering Nuno Espirito Santo's Valencia side have been in fine fettle this season.

It is far too early to pin them as potential title contenders, but this triumph was a statement of intent.

Atletico, lacking the likes of Thibaut Courtois and Diego Costa, who both featured here last season, look a weaker side.

They have bought well, with Mario Mandzukic doing a passable job up front, but the team doesn't yet have the energy of last year's outfit.

Guilherme Siqueira, the left-back bought to replace Filipe Luis, now of Chelsea, was at fault for this defeat too, missing a penalty.

Mandzukic had dragged his side back into the game after Valencia keeper Diego Alves had palmed away Tiago's stinging drive, straight into the path of the Croatian.

He headed home from close range to give his side a lifeline, which they could have turned into a full-blown comeback had Siqueira taken more care.

Atletico were denied a penalty when the ball struck Antonio Barragan's hand, but Fernando Teixeira Vitienes pointed to the spot when Jose Luis Gaya committed the same crime minutes later.

Alves had an excellent penalty saving record and he dived to his right to gather Siqueira's effort.

With this stop, Alves joined Santiago Canizares as a record holder, having stopped 13 penalties and seen two others missed out of the 31 he has faced.

Atletico worked hard in the second-half, but to no avail.

Subsitute Alessio Cerci had a goal ruled out in stoppage time, as he handled it before firing past Alves. To add insult to injury, it earned him a second yellow card and the Italian was given his marching orders.

At full-time Valencia were sitting top of the La Liga table, at least before Barcelona took on Rayo Vallecano.

Atletico were a shock to the system for the Catalan giants and Real Madrid last season.

Santo will be hoping his Valencia side - still with new signing Alvaro Negredo to make his comeback from injury - can be this year's.
