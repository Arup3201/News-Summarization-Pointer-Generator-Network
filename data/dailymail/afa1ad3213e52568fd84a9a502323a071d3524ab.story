Sydneysiders woke up to a thick fog this morning that disrupted public transport and obscured many parts of the harbour and CBD.

All ferry services out of Circular Quay have been cancelled and will not resume until visibility improves.

Residents and commuters have captured atmospheric pictures of the fog and have shared them on social media.

A thick fog in Sydney obscured most of the city's skyline on Monday morning so only the tops of some skyscrapers were visible

Commuters and residents took impressive photos of icons like the Harbour Bridge completely swallowed in fog

Light westerly winds transported the fog from the western suburbs into the east

The Harbour Bridge, Opera House and CBD skyline were barely visible in the thick haze.

A Transport NSW spokeswoman said ferries that left Circular Quay before the fog rolled in would complete their journeys but all ferries arriving a the Quay would be stopped.

Ferry tickets were valid to use on trains and buses, she said.

A Sydney Airport spokeswoman said the fog had not impacted on flights at all.

Sydney is due for a partly cloudy day on Monday. There is a chance of showers this morning, mostly near the coast, and the temperature will hit a maximum of 20 degrees.

Weatherzone meteorologist Rob Sharpe said the high amount of rain in Sydney over the past month had created the perfect conditions for fog.

'There's quite a bit of moisture lingering in Sydney in the air,' Mr Sharpe told Daily Mail Australia.

'Last night in the western suburbs fog was allowed to form because the air was completely saturated as it cooled.

'Light westerly winds transported the fog from the western suburbs into the east.'

The thickest fog was around Richmond, which had visibility as low as 100m this morning.

Mr Sharpe said the fog was expected to clear by 9.30am.

The fog comes one week after a similar thick blanket rolled in over the city on the first day of Spring.

It cleared to be a typically crisp and sunny day for the beginning of the blooming season but not before the misty blanket covered the skyline, and was captured in images many Sydneysiders posted to Twitter and Instagram.

Bureau of Meterology's meteorologist Sarah Chadwick said fog was caused from clear skies overnight allowing the surface temperatures to cool down for the fog droplets to form.

'The air needs to be a little bit moist rather than dry conditions,' she said. 'When the temperature cools down to what we call the fog point it then condenses into liquid form instead of being clear invisible gas form to become clouds.'
