In the past year experts including Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking have said the rise of ‘super-intelligent’ robots poses a threat to humanity.

And now Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, too, has joined the voices calling for caution.

He said the rise of AI should be a concern, and he doesn't understand why people are not taking the threat seriously.

Bill Gates (pictured) has joined Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking in warning that AI poses a threat to humanity. In an AMA on Reddit he said he is 'concerned about super intelligence'. And he said he doesn't understand why some people are not concerned. He also revealed Microsoft was working on a virtual 'Personal Agent'

Taking part in an Ask Me Anything (AMA) Q&A session on Reddit, Mr Gates - who lives in the state of Washington, US - said: ‘I am in the camp that is concerned about super intelligence.

‘First the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well.

‘A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. I agree with Elon Musk and some others on this and don't understand why some people are not concerned.’

It has been suggested that as robots become more advanced, and we ask them to perform more and more tasks, they may be unable to empathise with human ethics and morals.

'Suppose that the programmers decide that the AI should pursue the final goal of “making people smile”.

'To human beings, this might seem perfectly benevolent. Thanks to their natural biases and filters, they might imagine an AI telling us funny jokes or otherwise making us laugh.

'But there are other ways of making people smile, some of which are not-so benevolent. You could make everyone smile by paralsying their facial musculature so that it is permanently frozen in a beaming smile.

'Such a method might seem perverse to us, but not to an AI. It may decide that coming up with funny jokes was a laborious and inefficient way of making people smile. Facial paralysis is much more efficient.'

Specifically, they may not be able to really understand right from wrong like a human does, no matter how safely we think we have programmed them.

Back in December,  Professor Hawking echoed Gates' sentiments, telling the BBC: 'The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.'

This followed claims he made earlier in the year when he said success in creating AI 'would be the biggest event in human history, [but] unfortunately, it might also be the last.'

In November, Elon Musk, the entrepreneur behind Space-X and Tesla, warned that the risk of 'something seriously dangerous happening' as a result of machines with artificial intelligence, could be in as few as five years.

He has previously linked the development of autonomous, thinking machines, to 'summoning the demon'.

Speaking at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) AeroAstro Centennial Symposium in October, Musk described artificial intelligence as our 'biggest existential threat'.

He said: 'I think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence. If I had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is, it's probably that. So we need to be very careful with artificial intelligence.

'I'm increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight, maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don't do something very foolish.

'With artificial intelligence we're summoning the demon. You know those stories where there's the guy with the pentagram, and the holy water, and … he's sure he can control the demon? Doesn't work out.'

Bill Gates' warning on AI echoes similar comments made by Elon Musk (left) and Stephen Hawking (right). In December Professor Hawking told the BBC: 'The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race,' while Musk has warned of 'something seriously dangerous happening'

Elsewhere in the AMA, Mr Gates answered some other questions from Reddit users.

Responding to one comment, he hinted at a new technology he was working on that could act as a sort of personal assistant, although he did not elaborate much further. 

Earlier this month Microsoft  revealed  a 'holodeck' headset that allows wearers to see 3D images superimposed over their vision. 

The wireless headset, called HoloLens, can project 3D images into the wearer's field of view - making it appear as if screens, games and even people are in front of them.

It uses a visor to project 'holographic' images onto the wearer's field of view.

It uses sensors to track the wearer's head to ensure the hologram is in the same way.

A projection system them beams the holographic images into the wearer's eye, fooling the brain into thinking they are real. 

The cameras also has a camera to track the user's hands, allowing them to interact with the holographic images. 

‘One project I am working on with Microsoft is the Personal Agent which will remember everything and help you go back and find things and help you pick what things to pay attention to,' he said.

‘The idea that you have to find applications and pick them and they each are trying to tell you what is new is just not the efficient model - the agent will help solve this. It will work across all your devices.’

And if Microsoft hadn’t worked out for him when he started the company back in 1975, Mr Gates said he ‘would probably be a researcher on AI.’

He continued: ‘When I started Microsoft I was worried I would miss the chance to do basic work in that field.’

He also had time to comment on the newly revealed HoloLens, saying: ‘The HoloLens is pretty amazing. Microsoft has put a lot into the chips and the software.

'It is the start of virtual reality. Making the device so you don't get dizzy or nauseous is really hard - the speed of the alignment has to be super super fast. It will take a few years of software applications being built to realize the full promise of this.'
