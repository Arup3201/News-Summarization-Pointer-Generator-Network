The Cleaning Guys have dealt this toxic chemical spills, horrific crime scenes and industrial accidents, but company officials admit none of it had prepared them for their newest job - sanitizing the apartment where U.S. Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan spent three days before being admitted to the hospital. 

The Dallas-based company has stepped up to clear the soiled bed sheets and clothes that contain Duncan's sweat and other bodily fluids - after his girlfriend revealed they are still in the apartment five days after he was admitted to the hospital and confirmed to have Ebola. 

'Obviously, I think anyone involved would be worried -- not necessarily worried, but cautious. We've had a lot of discussions and team meetings about how we're going to attack the situation,' Cleaning Guys vice president Brad Smith told ABC News.

Big mess: The Cleaning Crew arrived on scene Friday to decontaminate the apartment where Thomas Duncan stayed while infected with Ebola

Suited up: six to eight Cleaning Guys crew members suited up in full hazmat gear to clean the apartment and removed contaminated bedding

'But we run into hazardous chemicals and things that could hurt us probably more often than most.'

Officials hired the Cleaning Guys on Friday after another company backed out of a contract to clean the apartment at The Ivy Apartments in Dallas. 

The owner of that company had claimed he didn't have the proper permits to transport hazardous materials on state highways. 

Mr Smith told ABC that Duncan's sheets, blankets and and other belongings in the apartment will be triple-bagged and packed away by the company's crew. They will then be handed over to another company that will incinerate everything.

Six to eight cleaners will work in the apartment and anyone who goes in will be suited up in hazmat gear that includes a full face mask, a respirator and a face shield. 

Ebola has been proven to live in clothing and surfaces for at least six days in ideal conditions. 

Duncan's girlfriend, Louise Troh, has been quarantined in the apartment she shared with the Ebola patient - along with her 13-year-old son and two nephews.

She shockingly revealed to CNN on Thursday that the sheets he sweated in were still on the bed and towels and other clothing with his bodily fluids had not been picked up. 

Sealed off: Workers used plastic tarps to seal off the apartment where Duncan had been staying

None of the 100 people Duncan had contact with while contagious are showing signs of infection - though about a dozen people are under close observation.  

The family must be relocated before the cleanup full can begin, a spokesman for the city of Dallas said. He had no information on where the family will go.

Visitors from the American Red Cross were seen Thursday bringing food to the apartment door. The North Texas Food Bank said it sent three days of cereal, tuna, produce and other supplies.

Outside, the management of the 300-unit complex in northeast Dallas was passing out flyers about Ebola to residents. Private security guards and local sheriff's deputies blocked off the entrance to dozens of reporters.

Apartment manager Sally Nuran said employees were power-washing sidewalks and scrubbing common areas, though she believed Duncan had not visited most of the complex in his short time there.
