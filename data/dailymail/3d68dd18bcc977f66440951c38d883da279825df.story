A political activist recently confronted a woman through the window of her home in Ontario, California over the flag flying in her front yard

She goes on to say: 'This is America. Maybe you can move to Mexico if you want to fly your Mexican flag. Does that make sense?'

Ms Capps later posted a video of her confrontation on YouTube.  

KCAL reported that the woman who was accosted inside her home by Capps did not understand the questions because she does not speak English and was caught off-guard.

The women's husband Sigifredo Banuelos later told the station that he had not meant to offend and that the family were simply celebrating their Mexican origins. 

The Banuelos family also fly an American flag outside their home. 

Ms Capps said she was offended by the flag, adding that she is 'not racist but a patriot'. 

She also said that since posting the video to YouTube she has been threatened and abused and lost her job at a local real estate agency.

Local authorities said that flying a Mexican flag does not break laws of any kind.  

Ms Capps asked the woman: 'Maybe you can move to Mexico if you want to fly your Mexican flag. Does that make sense?' Sigifredo Banuelos (right), whose wife was confronted, said that he had not meant to offend
