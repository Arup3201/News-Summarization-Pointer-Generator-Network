Charles 'Lucky' Lockett moaned in a letter to his wife about the lack of games facilities in Colditz, where he was imprisoned

A letter written by a captured RAF pilot has given a rare
insight into the notorious World War Two prisoner of war camp, Colditz Castle –
by one of its most audacious inmates.

Air Commodore Charles ‘Lucky’ Lockett was incarcerated after
he was shot down over the Sedan, in France, in 1940, earning his nickname as the
only survivor of the attack.

An extraordinary letter he sent to his wife in England after
spending three years in the camp is going under the hammer tomorrow.

In the pencil written note, he moaned about the lack of
games facilities at Colditz, branding them ‘a disgrace’ but complimented a
doctor who lanced his boils with a ‘razor blade’.

After his crash landing he was handed over to German soldiers
and despite a number of unsuccessful escape attempts - including making it on
board a Swedish ship – he was taken to the PoW camp, near Leipzig, known as
Oflag IV-C in 1940.

During the war the castle was converted into a high security
prisoner-of-war camp for officers who had become security or escape risks or
who were regarded as particularly dangerous.

But that didn’t stop lucky Mr Lockett.

He is credited with having been on the team which built the
legendary ‘Colditz Cock’ - an incredible escape plan which involved launching a
home-made glider from the castle’s roof.

The take-off was scheduled for spring 1945, but by then the
result of the war was becoming clear and the plan was ditched.

The remarkable letter was written by WWII legend, Charles Edward Stuart 'Lucky' Lockett to his wife in England from Colditz Castle dated August 14 1943

Tomorrow the letter is expected to fetch over £500 when it
is auctioned by Mullock’s Auctioneers at Ludlow Racecourse in Shropshire.

Dated August 14, 1943, it is written in pencil on a
pre-printed prisoner of war form - stamped with German and British censor
marks.

Sent to his wife and signed ‘Charles’, the pilot says that
he has sent his wife some photographs.

In the letter, ‘Lucky’ Lockett writes: ‘The footballers are
a mixed bunch.

‘I haven’t been down to the football field for a hell of a
time due to stoppages of privileges or some other reason.

The letter gives a rare insight into life at the notorious PoW camp

‘The lack of games playing facilities in what is to be an all
British camp is a disgrace.

‘The French men get parcels from France which supplement
their Red X parcels and take infinite trouble over their cooking. The result is
quite amazing.

‘A new Scotch doctor Capt Dickie has arrived and is messing
with us he is as far as first impressions go an excellent fellow.

‘I’ve seen quite a lot of him ‘cos I’ve had a couple of boils
...he lanced one with a razor blade two days ago.’

A spokesperson from Mullock’s Auctioneers said: ‘Letters
from Colditz are becoming scarce and Lucky Lockett had a colourful war to say
the least.

‘It is expected to sell for between £300 and £500 but World
War Two items get a lot of interest we hope it could go even higher.’

The idea for the glider came from Lieutenant Tony Rolt.

He realised the roof line, obscured from the German soldiers' view, would make a perfect launching point to fly over the River Maude, surrounding the castle.

The workshop was set up in the attics of the building, behind a false wall, and the team of men were aided by a library book on aircraft design.

It is thought the team would have broken through the end wall and launched the glider off a ramp mounted on the roof adjacent.

Wood from bed slats, floor boards, spare electrical wire and prison sleeping bags were all used to construct the two-seater monoplane.

The rake-off was scheduled for Spring 1945, but was put on held when the war began to come to a close.

However, the team kept their plan on stand-by, fearing a massacre of prisoners.

The glider was approaching completion when the American Army liberated the camp on 16 April 1945.
