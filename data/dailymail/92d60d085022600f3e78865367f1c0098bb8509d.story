Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher has urged his old club not to re-sign Fernando Torres.

The Spanish forward, who is currently on loan at AC Milan from Chelsea, has been linked with a move back to Anfield.

But Carragher believes his former team-mate Torres, 30, is past his best and that Liverpool should be looking to bring in a younger up-and-coming striker instead.

Carragher told TalkSPORT: 'I wouldn't like to see [Torres return], if I'm being totally honest.

'If Liverpool bring a striker in you want a young, fresh, and energetic young fellow who is looking to make a name for himself.

'Fernando Torres has had an unbelievable career with the trophies that he has won but I think we saw the best of him at Anfield and that was quite a few years ago now.

'With that move to Milan you're thinking a slower paced game would suit him a bit more now, because of the problems he's had with injuries, but it looks straight away that AC Milan are keen to offload him.

'If Chelsea and Milan are thinking the same I don't think anything would change too much at Liverpool.'
