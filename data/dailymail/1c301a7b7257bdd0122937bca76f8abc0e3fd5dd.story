After it went out of fashion at the end of the 19th century, it seemed taxidermy  was dead and buried.

Other than in the Natural History Museum and the living rooms of pet-lovers who could not quite let go when their animal died, it was no longer in fashion.

But now a new breed of have-a-go animal-stuffers have tried their hand at the old art - and the end products range from the bizarre to the downright scary.

Is it a bird? Is it a rabbit? Erm, it is sort of both. This bizarre creation is just one of the strange attempts at taxidermy in Kat Su's Crappy Taxidermy book and blog

Not a piggy bank: This odd-looking brown, fluffy bear, which features in Ms Su's book and blog, got the taxidermy treatment but had a coin slot added on afterwards

Mutant winged rabbits, owls with googly eyes and bears with money holes were all found by New York writer Kat Su when she looked for tasteful taxidermy to decorate her home. 

The awful animals led her to start a hilarious blog - crappytaxidermy.com - where she documents all the terrible attempts at taxidermy she can find.

The blog is now in its fifth year and the Crappy Taxidermy Facebook page has more than 10,000 likes.

Ms Su has even written a book on the strange stuffed creatures, Crap Taxidermy, which showcases her discoveries.

Twit twoo: An amateur's attempt at stuffing this owl seemed to be going well... until the not-so realistic googly eyes were added on to its chirpy face

Superman or mouse: This rodent, which looks like it might function well as a pencil case, can be unzipped to reveal a blue Superman shirt under its white, smooth fur

Ms Su told the Daily Mirror that she made the book and blog so people could enjoy other people's creations, rather than to make fun of them.

She said: 'The book is a celebration of crappy taxidermy and the eccentric and amazing people who create it.

'It isn't meant to be disparaging. I hope that people will delight in looking at the strange and preposterous specimens.'

Crap Taxidermy by Kat Su, is available from www.octopusbooks.co.uk for £7.99. 

The stuff of nightmares: This terrifying stuffed bat, which you certainly would not snuggle up to at night, comes complete with chipped teeth and big bulging eyes

Ms Su says her book and blog are designed for celebrating amateur taxidermy, rather than for making fun of it, and hopes readers enjoy the 'preposterous specimens'

After five years of running the blog, Ms Su, from New York, put together a book filled with her favourite awful taxidermy attempts that had previously featured online
