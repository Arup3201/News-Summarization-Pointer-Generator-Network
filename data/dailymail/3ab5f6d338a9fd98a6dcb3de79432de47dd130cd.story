The Queen is set to feel the pinch of the economic downturn as she faces a pay freeze until 2015.

The royal household is set to see six consecutive years of funding cuts - affecting the Queen’s income, which has dropped in real terms since 2009.

The austerity measures mean the monarch’s royal palace repairs will likely be halted.

And any extra taxpayers’ money previously used to fund the court of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, will also no longer be available, according to the Sunday Times.

The Prince of Wales will be responsible for the costs of providing staff for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, until Charles becomes king.

While the Queen won’t see a pay rise until at least 2015 following the replacement of the civil list with the sovereign grant.

The monarch’s funding is now linked to profits at the Crown Estate instead of taxpayers’ money paying for royal travel and royal palaces.

Almost two-thirds of people believe living standards will decline in the coming decades with the current generation of children ending up worse off than their parents, according to a new poll.

An Ipsos Mori survey for The Observer revealed that 64 per cent of those questioned believe it was unlikely that today's youth would have a better life than their mothers and fathers while just 32 per cent thought it was likely.

When asked whether their children would have a higher or lower quality of life when they reached their age, just under a quarter (23 per cent) said they believed it would be higher, while 35 per cent said it would be lower and 32 per cent saying it would be the same.

The opinion represents a big swing since April 2003, when 43 per cent of people believed their children would be better off at the same stage of life and 12 per cent thought they would be worse off.

The poll was conducted between November 19-21 - before the Chancellor's Autumn statement announced a further raft of austerity measures.

George Osborne said the stalling economy meant the Government's efforts to tackle the deficit would have to continue far beyond the next general election and warned the problems could become even worse if the eurozone crisis spirals out of control.

The Queen’s funding will now equal 15
per cent of the profits made two years previously by the Crown Estate, 
under the new law which passed six weeks ago.

The Crown Estate includes Regent Street, Windsor Great Park and over 50 per cent of the UK’s shoreline.

Chancellor George Osborne has imposed the freeze on the Queen’s taxpayer funding – setting payments at £30m per year until April 2013.

But she will receive a further one-off payment of £1m to fund the cost of the diamond jubilee.

In stark contrast, she received £77.3m from taxpayer funding in 1991-2, but since the recession she’s seen a huge drop.

In 2008-9 it had fallen to £38.3m, while last year she received only £32.1m, according to an official Treasury briefing document placed in the House of Commons and House of Lords libraries.

The Sunday Time reported that the 
Sovereign Grant Bill reads: ‘The grant levels envisaged in the early 
years of the new system [starting in April 2013] are, in real terms, 
below what the Royal Household spent in every one of the last 20 years.

The
Crown Estate has estimated that in 2014 it will donate £250m to the 
Treasury, suggesting that the Queen will be paid £37.5m in the year to 
2016.

The
Prince of Wales’ income comes from the Duchy of Cornwall, which last 
year made £17.8 – which not only supports the court of William and Kate,
but also Prince Harry and his future wife and family.

Although
Charles is paying for William and Kate’s staff at Kensington Palace, 
structural work will still be funded with taxpayer money.
