An elementary school teacher in Houston, Texas, has been warned by administrators to stop writing on his students.

The teacher, who hasn’t been named, works at Thurgood Marshall Elementary School and has allegedly left marks on students on several occasions using a marker pen.

The matter has come to a head after one parent, Victor Jimenez, was shocked when his 8-year-old son returned home with a ‘B’ written on his face.

The teacher left the mark because the second grader – who isn’t named -  didn't complete his homework.

Victor Jimenez, who complained to school authorities, told KPRC that he doesn’t believe the teacher should be allowed to keep his job.

‘For me, he does not have any professionalism or ethics at all,’ said Jimenez. ‘I do not understand how he can continue being a teacher.’

According to Jimenez this isn’t an isolated incident. He said he was told by the school that several other students have had the same issue with the same teacher.

The incident happened at Thurgood Marshall Elementary School in Houston, Texas, and Jimenez has called for the teacher involved to be fired

The Houston Independent School District released a statement on Monday in which they confirmed that administrators had met with the teacher and that he had confirmed the allegations.

‘Administrators launched an investigation and met with the teacher, who confirmed the report. The situation is being handled as a personnel matter, and the teacher has been directed to cease the practice,' said the HISD.
