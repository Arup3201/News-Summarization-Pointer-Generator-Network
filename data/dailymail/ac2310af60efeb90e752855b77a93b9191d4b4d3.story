Laura Barker claims her career was ruined by her former chief-executive Steven Holliday

With her sunglasses perched on  her head and a bright smile for the camera, this is the glamorous executive at the centre of a sex row involving a married energy firm boss.

Laura Barker, 32, was last night revealed as the woman who allegedly had her career ruined because she could not meet the ‘sexual demands’ of Steven Holliday.

She worked for Mr Holliday as the vice- president of marketing at the US wing of National Grid, where he is chief executive.

Her parents claim the 55-year-old pursued her for sex and then sabotaged her career when she began to reject his advances.

Now, after quitting her lucrative job at the energy company, they say she is unemployed and fears she will never find work again.

Last night, her father Keith spoke out to tell the Daily Mail that Mr Holliday, who is also a non-executive director of Marks & Spencer, had ruined his daughter’s future.

He said: ‘Mr Holliday is trying to save his career. But he’s got no respect. She was a high-flier. She worked in Boston and New York. She’s not working now and she can’t get a position. She has no career, no future.

‘I’ve seen through the last two years what she has gone through trying to resurrect her career.

‘And all the way through there have been problems with the company Mr Holliday is head of.’

Mr Barker, 63, said he and his estranged wife Brigid decided to confront Mr Holliday ‘of their own volition’ and are still discussing the incident with their daughter.

Mrs Barker interrupted the M&S annual general meeting at London’s Royal Festival Hall on Tuesday to accuse Mr Holliday of ‘breaching his own code of ethics’ in front of 2,000 stunned shareholders.

Allegations: Steven Holliday has not made any comments in regards to being accused of making sexual advances on Miss Barker and then 'ruined her career' when she could not meet them

The pair were escorted out after Mrs Barker claimed he had pursued their daughter and then ‘destroyed her career when she could no longer meet his sexual demands’. She did not state her name when she made the allegations, but was happy to reveal her identity after the meeting.

Mr Barker added: ‘We wouldn’t have stood up and said what we said if we didn’t feel strongly. We can see how it’s devastated her.’

Miss Barker spent eight years at National Grid, three of which were in Boston, as director and then vice-president of marketing. She began her career at ExxonMobil, where Mr Holliday also spent 19 years – although they did not work together there.

From yesterday's Daily Mail

When she left National Grid in 2010, she was appointed as marketing director at Imperial College London, but left six months ago and has not worked since.

It is understood she recently applied for another high-level position but was rejected.

She lives in London with her mother while her father, an engineer, still lives at the family’s £270,000 four-bedroom detached house in Solihull, West Midlands.

National Grid has said it launched an investigation into the allegations in 2010 but they were found to be ‘without foundation’. Mr Holliday declined to comment.
