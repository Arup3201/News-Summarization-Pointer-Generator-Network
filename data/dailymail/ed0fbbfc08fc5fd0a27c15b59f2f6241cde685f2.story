Imagine turning the pages of your ebook with your eyes, swiping the screen on Fruit Ninja by looking left or right, or pausing a video simply by looking at the stop button.

That’s the promise from Danish-built technology EyeTribe.

The EyeTribe tracker costs $99 (£59) and uses infrared light sensors to locate features of a viewer’s eyes. Software can then take an accurate guess where they are looking, also known as the point of gaze, and move the mouse cursor to the relevant point on the screen.

EyeTribe uses infrared illumination sensors to locate the features of a person’s eyes. 

It then uses an advanced mathematical formula to determine their point of gaze. 

The
 EyeTribe can be calibrated to pick up 9, 12 or 16 points on each eye 
and works up to a distance of between 17 and 29 inches.

The current 
tracker can be fitted to PCs and Microsoft Surface 
tablets.

The firm has also now made the technology available to 
Android developers. 

The current tracker can be fitted to computer monitors and Microsoft Surface Pro tablets.

The firm has also now made the technology available to Android developers for the first time.

To install EyeTribe on a computer, the user needs to add a small amount of code to the operating system and this is why the technology is aimed at developers, rather than consumers.

However, the technology can be fitted to smartphones, in place of front-facing cameras for example, so future versions may be integrated into new handsets and tablets.

The company was set up in 2011 by Sune Alstrup Johansen, Javier San Agustin, Martin Tall and Henrik Skovsgaard after they left the IT University of Copenhagen.

‘We’ve spent a tremendous effort on making [EyeTribe] easy to set up and fully automatic so that it works accurately and reliably in a wide range of environments,’ explained the founders.

‘We have also built the world’s only eye-tracking solution for Android that allows for a seamless integration into everyday products such as smartphones, tablets, consumer electronics and cars.’

EyeTribe works with standard glasses, but the firm said there can be accuracy problems with bifocals and other special lenses, or glasses that have coating - including polarised glasses.

The first batch of trackers was released last year but sold out.

Customers can now pre-order trackers from the second batch which will be shipped in Spring this year.
