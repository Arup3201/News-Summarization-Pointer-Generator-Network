A 12-year-old boy is lucky to be alive after he was almost decapitated - after cycling into a rope strung across a bridge by sick pranksters.

These shocking pictures show the horrific injuries to Euan Cusack’s neck after he rode straight into the six-foot long rope at 15 mph.

Euan was on a bike ride with friends when he cycled straight into a taut rope tied by suspected pranksters on a footbridge in Treeharris, near Merthyr Tydfill, South Wales.

Injuries: Euan, 12, suffered deep cuts and rope burns to his face and neck after the incident

He was left with deep cuts and rope burns on his face and neck - but miraculously, survived.

His furious mum, Sandra, 44, said: 'As soon as I saw, and all the scars all over his face, I rushed him straight to the doctors, I couldn't believe my eyes.

'When walked into the doctor's surgery everybody stared at him. His injuries were awful.

'The doctor was so shocked when he saw Euan, he had no idea how he could have got such bad scars.

Burns: The rope gashed Euan's face and neck when he rode into it at speed as he tried to cross a footbridge

'He told me to take lots of pictures so we could try and catch the people that did it.'

She added: 'The rope was thin and white so of course, from a distance, you couldn’t see it.

'Anything could have happened. He could have broken his neck or been decapitated.

'It’s just awful, I couldn’t believe it when I saw him. The rope could have strangled him, or he could have ended up going over the bridge and into the rapids below.

Narrow escape: Euan was out cycling with friends when he rode straight into the six-foot long rope at 15 mph

'Obviously these people thought it was funny, but it’s not, it could have been fatal.

'We just want them to realise what they’ve done, they need to learn their lesson.

'The more I think about what could have happened to him, the worse it gets.

'He could have had his throat cut and bled to death for all those pranksters know. I just can’t believe it.'

Euan said: 'I think it’s really stupid what these people did, and now I’ve got horrible scars. I just want to find out who did this to me.'

Terrifying: Euan was riding home with friends when he cycled into the rope

Euan is in a state of shock since his accident, and is only just coming to terms with the situation.

Sandra, a full-time mum, said: 'He’s nervous about going out on his bike now, and we’re nervous about letting him.

'He’s been in pain with his injuries too as they’ve started to bleed. Whenever he moves his neck I can tell he’s in pain.'

The incident has been put down to pranksters but so far no one has come forward to take responsibility for their actions.

Responsibility: No one has owned up to the apparent prank - 'whoever did this needs to learn their lesson,' said Euan's mother

After the incident Euan raced into town in tears to see his mum who had been doing the weekly shop.

Sandra said: 'When I saw him I couldn’t believe my eyes. He had a rope burns all over his face and neck, and he’d cut his eye.

'Hopefully whoever did this will see his injuries and question their actions. I just don’t want anything like this happening again.'

A spokesperson for South Wales Police said: 'This
incident was reported to police and we are currently investigating.

'We would urge anyone with information to contact
us.'
