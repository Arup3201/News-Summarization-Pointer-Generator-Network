Two horses had to be put down after suffering injuries on the opening day of the meeting attended by The Queen and other members of the royal family.

Irish-trained Case Statement sustained a fractured near fore fetlock in the Coventry Stakes. Mark Johnston-trained Sir Graham Wade was humanely put down after fracturing a pelvis in the Ascot Stakes.

Jenny Hall, chief veterinary officer for the BHA, said: ‘Case Statement received immediate first aid on course from the racecourse veterinary surgeons before being transferred by horse ambulance to the veterinary assessment centre at the racecourse stables where he was X-rayed.

‘The X-rays confirmed that Case Statement had sustained a fracture of his near-fore fetlock.

‘Following full evaluation, the nature of the injury was such that sadly there was no other option but for the horse to be humanely put down.’

On Sir Graham Wade, Hall said: ‘The vets diagnosed that he had suffered a serious pelvis fracture that the nature of the injury was such that there was no other option than to be humanely put down.’
