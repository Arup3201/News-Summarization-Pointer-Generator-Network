Thousands of pro-democracy protesters clashed with police tonight as they tried to surround the Hong Kong government headquarters.

The demonstrators have stepped up their campaign for genuine democratic reforms after camping out on the city's streets for more than two months.

They carried umbrellas - which have become symbols of their movement - and battled police armed with pepper spray, batons and riot shields.

The scenes have become familiar since the pro-democracy movement began in late September.

Student leaders told a big crowd tonight at the main protest site outside the government headquarters that they would escalate their campaign.

Then, hundreds of protesters pushed past police lines on the other side of the complex from the protest site.

They blocked traffic on a main road, but were stopped by police barricades from going down a side road to Chief Executive Leung Chun-Ying's office.

The protesters, many wearing surgical masks, hard hats and safety goggles, were chanting ‘I want true democracy'.

They said they wanted to occupy the road to prevent Mr Leung and other government officials from getting to work in the morning.

At one point, police charged the crowd, aggressively pushing demonstrators back with pepper spray and batons, after some protesters started pelting them with water bottles and other objects. 

They later fell back, letting demonstrators re-occupy the road.

Police Senior Superintendent Tsui Wai-hung said 40 protesters had been arrested, adding that authorities would not let the road, a major thoroughfare, remain blocked.

‘We will open up this road,’ he told reporters.

Protesters said they were taking action to force a response from Hong Kong's government, which has made little effort to address their demands that it scrap a plan by China's Communist leaders to use a panel of Beijing-friendly elites to screen candidates for Hong Kong's leader in inaugural 2017 elections.

‘The action was aimed at paralysing the government's operation,’ said Alex Chow, secretary general of the Hong Kong Federation of Students.

‘The government has been stalling ... and we believe we need to focus pressure on the government headquarters, the symbol of the government's power.’

The federation is one of two students groups that have played important roles in organizing the protest movement in the former British colony.

‘I really want to have real elections for Hong Kong because I don't want the Chinese government to control us, our minds, anything,’ said protester Ernie Kwok, 21, a maintenance worker and part-time student.

The most recent clash took place as protesters tried to gain access to the government headquarters

Authorities last week used an aggressive operation to clear out the protest camp on the busy streets of Hong Kong's crowded Mong Kok district, one of three protest zones around the semi-autonomous city.

In Britain, a diplomatic row erupted as MPs were banned from going to Hong Kong amid growing alarm over China’s crackdown on the protesters.

Politicians on the Foreign Affairs Committee were warned they will be denied entry if they go ahead with a planned visit to the former British colony.

Committee chairman Sir Richard Ottaway said they had been told by the Chinese embassy that they would be turned back if they tried to enter.
