A father-of-one who ate 5,000 calories a day and had a 54 inch waist has shed nearly half his body weight.

Lee Bennett, 42, was experiencing chronic stress and mounting health problems having reached 26st after years of inactivity and a poor diet.

But following the breakdown of his 25-year marriage, Mr Bennett, from Egham, Surrey, decided to finally take control of his lifestyle.

Lee Bennett, 42, lost 14st 7lb after 18 months of dieting and exercising. He now weighs just 11st 7lb and has a 32-inch waist

Before his weight loss, Mr Bennett was experiencing chronic stress and numerous health problems

The IT consultant lost an incredible 14st 7lb through dieting and exercise - abandoning his daily sausage roll for breakfast - and says he now has a 'new lease of life'.

After 18 months, he now weighs just 11st 7lb and can fit into a 32-inch waist band.

He said: 'The old me compared to the man I am today is like comparing chalk and cheese. It hasn’t been an easy couple of years but I feel as though I’ve come through the worst of it and I’m finally back in control.'

Mr Bennett saw his weight pile on as work commitments pushed him towards junk food and left him with little time to take exercise.

He said: 'I used to work in a warehouse 20 years ago, and the physical activity kept me slim. Then I got a promotion and began sitting behind a desk every day. That’s when things began to change.

'The weight gain crept up on me until I reached the 26 stone mark, at which point I started getting medical issues like shooting pains in my back and numbness down my leg. 

It was quite worrying and debilitating. My leg would go so numb I felt as if I was carrying a dead weight around with me.

'I
 became depressed and food became a crutch. I would think nothing of 
eating a giant sausage roll for breakfast and eating a double portion of
 takeaway in the evening.'

BEFORE:

Breakfast: 2 pain au chocolates or a jumbo sausage roll

Lunch: Burger, chips and a large cola

Dinner: Double helping of spaghetti bolognese with cheese

Snacks: Chocolate

AFTER 

Breakfast: Porridge with a banana and cranberries

Lunch: Pita filled with turkey and salad with carrot sticks on the side

Dinner: Home-made chicken curry for an evening meal

Snacks: Grain bars

As his weight increased, his crippling anxiety and depression put a strain on his marriage.

He
 said: 'I didn’t want to go anywhere or do anything. Everything was an 
effort. I would get upset and angry if I had to do anything I wasn’t 
comfortable with.

'I didn’t want to go on family 
holidays - I was worried that I wouldn’t be able to fit into the plane 
seat. I was embarrassed by my poor health and fitness and the anxiety 
fed off itself.

'All those things had an effect on my marriage. It wasn’t the cause of the marriage breakdown, but it didn’t help.'

When
 Mr Bennett and his ex-wife separated in July 2012, his thoughts began 
to turn towards making a lasting change for the better.

He
 said: 'I wanted nothing more than to have a measure of control over 
something. I felt as if the separation was beyond my control, but at 
least with my health I could influence it directly.'

Mr Bennett embarked on the Cambridge Weight Plan, which comprises calorie-controlled meals.

Before making the switch, he typically ate up to 5,000 calories a day - twice the recommended daily intake for an adult male.

Mr Bennett lost the weight by slashing his calorie intake by 70 per cent to just 2,000 calories a day

Breakfast would be two pain auchocolates or a jumbo sausage roll, followed by a burger with chips and a large cola for lunch, with a double helping of spaghetti bolognese with cheese for dinner.

He also snacked on chocolate throughout the day.

Today, Mr Bennett has slashed his calorie intake by 70 per cent, currently consuming around 2,000 calories a day.

He eats porridge with a banana and cranberries for breakfast, followed by a pita filled with turkey and salad with carrot sticks on the side for lunch.

Dinner is typically a home-made chicken curry and snacks are grain bars.

As his weight fell away, Mr Bennett, who has a 17-year-old daughter Chloe, was able to start exercising, taking up cycling again for the first time in years.

He said: 'I'm the fittest I’ve ever been in my life now. I think nothing of cycling 40 miles and enjoying it.

'It feels wonderful to have more energy to be a dad.

'My weight loss has affected my whole life and one of the plus points is that I’m able to get up and go shopping with Chloe - all the fun things that I wouldn’t have been able to do before.'
