Fulham are making a £7million move for Leeds United striker Ross McCormack.

The Scotland international stayed behind while his teammates went on their pre-season trip to Santa Cristina in Italy on Monday.

The 27-year-old is due to hold talks once Leeds accept Fulham's revised bid although owner Massimo Cellino was holding out for £10million for a player who scored 28 goals last season.
