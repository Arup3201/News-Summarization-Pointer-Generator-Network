Stuart Pearce doesn't need me to defend him, but I'm not writing this specifically for him.

Some people have a grudge against others because of events in the past. Clearly when Danny Mills launched his verbal assault on under-pressure Pearce before the derby at Derby there was more to it than a well-thought-out football observation.

Pearce revealed all after his Forest side beat Derby. He'd dropped Mills when manager at Manchester City – hence the revenge.

Stuart Pearce isn't the only person who didn't rate Danny Mills, believe me.

I've always judged Pearce on the football: as a player, he was everything a fan, a manager and a team-mate would want: passionate, talented and ready to go to war for his colleagues and friends.

Before last summer I'd interviewed Pearce but never met him properly. He worked with us for talkSPORT out in Brazil at the World Cup. I'd heard that he didn't suffer fools gladly, so I was behind the eight ball form the start.

On his first evening we finished work and a group of us went out for a meal. I'd said a lot of things on air about Pearce and I wanted to tackle him off air.

To my delight he was right up for it, so after a brief bit of small-talk about our shared love of The Stranglers (he thinks Rattus is the best album, I'm more of a Black and White fan myself), we launched into it head-on.

Why did you think putting David James up front when Manchester City needed a goal was a good idea? Is your football too route one? Why did so many players pull out of your Under 21 squads? 

I was on a roll, but so was Pearce, and as pizza went cold we batted our views back and forth. It was one of my most enjoyable evenings of a brilliant and memorable trip.

I think he was surprised that someone had actually had the bottle to say these things to his face – so many have written them, and conveniently forgotten them when confronted with Pearce himself. His mistrust of the press came up early during the conversation in the pizzeria.

Overall I got some decent answers to my questions and he passionately defended himself as you'd expect. And I think he was pleased to get the chance to state his case. We agreed to disagree on many issues.

Pearce then travelled around Brazil for a few days commentating on games for talkSPORT while I was based at the Maracana and the Copacabana.

On his return I was intrigued to see how he would react after our verbal sparring. The ice was broken after I caught him singing 'The Magnificent Seven' by The Clash. It's one of those songs where I know all the words as well, another shared musical love of ours.

Pearce then sat down and gave me an interview of which I am very proud. It was in response to yet another England failure at a World Cup and listeners later told me they hung on his every word, even if they didn't agree with all of them.

That might have been part of his job, so the true test was when I turned up at a Forest game this season. I wasn't expecting Pearce to join me for a post-match interview up in the press box – he was certainly under no obligation to make the trip up to the back of the stand.

But he did, and it was good to see him again.

We're not best buddies or anything as unprofessional and cosy as that. And I still think he's got a lot to prove as a manager. But he's without doubt a man of integrity, and an honest, passionate guy.

He doesn't need or deserve individuals with a grudge blasting him. If he fails, it should be because of things he gets wrong rather than something  Mills has held against him for years.

I do like Pearce and I hope he takes Forest back to the Premier League.

But I'm still not having David James up front. 

Pearce doesn't need defending as, if he fails, it should be for football reasons and not for a grudge
