Arsene Wenger has urged his Arsenal team to use their Christmas fixtures to prove they are in a false position in the Barclays Premier League.

The sixth-placed Gunners face QPR on Boxing Day and then travel to West Ham and Southampton, clubs who sit directly above them in the table and rivals for Champions League qualification.

'We have to make sure that over Christmas we take advantage of the schedule we have and put the performances in,' Wenger said.

Arsenal conceded late against 10-man Liverpool last weekend to leave them sitting sixth in the table

Under-pressure manager Arsene Wenger hopes his side can show their true potential in the next three games

'We have a good opportunity over Christmas to show that we are much better than people think we are.

'Every team has difficult games, so it is the consistency in that period that will matter.'

QPR have yet to register an away point this season, but Wenger refuses to take victory at the Emirates Stadium on Friday for granted.

'We expect a QPR with nothing to lose. They will come and have a go at us,' Wenger said.

The return of Olivier Giroud in recent games has aided Wenger's striking options alongside Alexis Sanchez

Charlie Austin, who scored a hat-trick at the weekend, will be QPR's main threat on Boxing Day

'You focus on your own performance and don't expect any weakness from your opponent. In the Premier League every game is difficult and you just want to turn up.

'We played QPR two years ago and they were very difficult games. West Ham at the moment are in very good shape.

'We go away to Southampton, which is a very difficult as well. Again, it's down to our performances.'
