Accused: Nurse Roger Dean is given oxygen after the blaze

A nurse who claimed to have rescued patients from a nursing home fire has been charged with murder after five people died and 13 were critically injured.

Roger Dean is accused of four counts of murder and is expected to be charged with a fifth.

Four people died yesterday when fire raged through the nursing home in Sydney’s Quakers Hill suburb. The fifth, a 97-year-old woman, died in hospital earlier today.

On Friday, Dean told journalists that he had braved dense smoke to rescue the helpless patients in his care.

‘I just quickly did what I could to get everyone out,’ Dean said.

Det Supt Michael Willing said Dean had been helping with inquiries before he was charged.

The dramatic breakthrough came after 
homicide squad detectives and forensic investigators announced that the 
fire at the nursing home in Quakers Hill had been deliberately lit.

Wearing a black sports sweater, he said nothing as the case was heard at Sydney's Parramatta Local Court.

Dean, who had short spiky black hair 
with a bright red fringe, did not apply for bail and it was formally 
refused. He will appear in court again next Thursday. He is believed to 
have only worked in the home for a short while.

Care: An elderly resident from the home is strapped to a trolly and gently put into an ambulance

Shell-shocked: Many of the elderly were covered in soot and sveveral had to be treated for burns and smoke inhalation

Police said it was expected to take 
some time to establish exactly what was behind the lighting of two fires
that broke out in separate wings of the Principal nursing home in the 
early hours of yesterday morning.

A total of 32 people were taken to various hospitals, with 15 admitted to intensive care units.

As the media gathered at the scene of the blaze, where soot-blackened, confused and tearful residents lay in their beds that had been dragged onto the pavement, Dean talked to a television network.

He said it had been important to get the people out of there as quickly as possible

The fires forced 88 residents to be evacuated, many covered in 
soot. There are still grave fears for almost a dozen of the victims who are suffering from severe smoke inhalation.

Elderly and infirm who could not flee the fire were pulled, still in their beds onto the footpath amid chaotic scenes. The beds lined the footpath as the frightened and confused old people were looked after by 
ambulance officers and police.

Firemen even hosed down some of the soot-covered residents as they lay outside in their beds.

Difficult rescue: Around 100 resident were evacuated, many frightened, confused or physically injured

'The prognosis for the frail and elderly in an intensive care situation is pretty poor,' said Dr Nick Brennan, a geriatrician at Sydney's St Vincent's Hospital.

NSW Fire Commissioner Greg Mullins 
described the scene as 'chaotic' and 'tragic' as more than 100 fire 
crews, police and ambulance officers arrived at the home on Hambledon 
Road,  just after 5am.

'This
is a firefighter's worst nightmare,' Mr Mullins said. 'Turning up to a 
nursing home with elderly people who can't get themselves out of harm's 
way.

'Firefighters could not see their hands 
in front of their faces in the thick smoke so you can imagine what it 
was like for the elderly trying to escape.'

He said that firefighters had crawled
into the building through the thick smoke, reaching up to feel into 
beds to establish if there was anyone there who they could rescue.

'Getting them out was like a military operation,' he said.

Nightmare situation: At least 15 fire engines attended the scene and police are investigating using footage shot by a freelance cameraman

The wards at the back of the home, which is described on its website as providing a 'secure, friendly and home-style environment.'  were completely gutted.

Relatives
of the residents - some of whom are believed to be British-born - 
arrived at the scene, praying that their loved ones were among those 
rescued.

NSW fire Superintendent Rick Parkes said three of the victims were found in a six-room ward at the  back of the building. A fourth died later in hospital.

It was separated from the other parts of the single-storey home when a fire door came down to stop the blaze from spreading.

There was no sprinkler system in the nursing home as they are not required under state laws.

Freelance cameraman Adrian Munn, 
choking back tears at what he had witnessed, said: 'I saw only smoke 
when I arrived, billowing everywhere. One of the police officers grabbed
me and asked me to get all the footage I could.'

'They wanted to get as much as they could for an ongoing investigation.'

He added: 'It's quite a thing down 
here. It is very, very, sad, seeing elderly people gasping for breath, 
moaning and crying for help. It was a heartrending scene.'

Firefighters
reported flames shooting through the roof at one end of the building 
while another blaze was believed to have started in a bedroom.

NSW assistant police commissioner Robert Redfern earlier confirmed the fire was being treated as 'suspicious' and revealed that homicide and arson squads had joined fire investigators and forensic officers at the scene.'

But he stressed that 'all fires such as this' were considered suspicious.

Traumatised: Elderly residents were evacuated to the nearby church where they were cared for by local residents and counsellors

The Reverend Dave Hilliard, the senior state police chaplain, praised two young police officers who were among the first to enter the burning building and rescue residents.

'They're young and being asked to do some extraordinary things beyond their years,' he said. 'I'm blown away by them.'

Families of victims were being cared for in the nearby Quakers Hill Anglican Church by counsellors and chaplains from emergency services.

The fire is Sydney's worst since 16 residents died in a nursing home blaze in suburban Sylvania Heights in 1981.
