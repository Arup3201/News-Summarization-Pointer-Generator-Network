It was one of the finest goals seen at a World Cup, the perfect combination of audacity and breath-taking technique.

Glancing over his shoulder to check the positioning of Uruguay goalkeeper Fernando Muslera, James Rodriguez cushioned the ball expertly on his chest and, in one smooth, elegant movement, dispatched an immaculate volley that crashed in off the bar.

If you didn't know of King James of Colombia before, you certainly do now. His thunderbolt setting Colombia on the way to a quarter-final meeting with hosts Brazil and putting him top of the goalscoring charts with five in four games.

That strike was certainly a career highlight, but it only scratches the surface of the colourful variety of goals Rodriguez is capable of.

Despite being just 22, he has a well-honed free-kick technique - take, for example, the 30-yarder he stuck away for Colombia in their come-from-behind 3-1 win against Chile in qualification for Brazil 2014.

There was also his debut goal for Monaco against Rennes in November last year, a beautifully flighted free-kick into the far corner that started to repay the Â£38.5m Monaco paid Porto for him the previous summer.

Rodriguez spent three seasons at the Portuguese giants, scoring 32 goals and contributing 21 assists in 105 appearances. His time was marked with three Portuguese titles, a Portuguese Cup and the UEFA Europa League in 2011.

There is such beauty and promise in some of the goals he scored there, from deft chips over an advancing goalkeeper to shifting his body weight to deceive defenders before slotting home.

Highlights included a well-judged lob at Olhanense in September 2012 that dropped in over the heads of two defenders and the goalkeeper, a sublime one-two and finish into the top corner to draw Porto level against rivals Benfica and a late curled winner on the left foot to beat Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League (see next video).

 

It was also soon clear that Rodriguez had the ability to control matches - he was composed in possession and always knew where his team-mates stood.

Whether the pass was long-range or short, Rodriguez was able to find someone in the same colours, while he excelled too at crossing and direct running.

Rodriguez has been scoring lovely goals on the European scene for some time - and with Argentine club Banfield beforehand - but now his presence is truly global.

With offers likely to flood in from leading clubs in the Premier League and La Liga, Rodriguez could soon be bringing such exceptional abilities to an even loftier level.
