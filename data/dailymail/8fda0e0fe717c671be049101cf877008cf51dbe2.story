One proud father has become a walking gallery for his child's artwork.

Keith Anderson from Ontario, Canada - a self-described climber, adventurer and cycling enthusiast - started getting his son Kai's doodles tattooed on his body eight years ago.

Now the 42-year-old has a colorful spread of imaginative drawings covering his arms, from abstract shapes to a robot dressed as a butler.

Novel idea: Keith Anderson from Ontario, Canada - a self-described climber, adventurer and cycling enthusiast - started getting his son Kai's doodles tattooed on his body eight years ago

Walking gallery: Now the 42-year-old has a colorful sleeve of imaginative drawings covering his arm, from abstract shapes to a 'robot butler' - the shape above was inspired by a stained glass window 

Bonding time: Kai even helped his father ink recently and apparently loved getting in on the act

He currently has 18 different tattoos designed by his 11-year-old son.

Talking about the tradition, he told ABC News: 'They are very meaningful to me. 

'They capture a moment in time each year of Kai's life that take me back to how he looked, acted and sounded as a kid growing up.'

The doting father got his first inking in 2008 when Kai was just four-years-old. 

He picked out a daisy that Kai had sketched just before starting kindergarten.

A horse and a maple leaf with a 'C' for Canada were among the other drawings he selected from the youngster's scrap book.

Keith said he was inspired to immortalize his son's art in ink when when his brother inked his own daughter's artwork onto his leg. 

Long-running tradition: Kieth got his first inking in 2008 when Kai was just four-years-old

Abstract: The tattoos perfectly match the original drawings - even the colors 

C for Canada: Keith's story recently came to light after images from photographer Chance Faulkner were posted online

Thinking outside the box: Kai's 'robot butler' is one of the more imaginative designs 

Inspired by nature: A daisy drawn by Kai around the age of four, left, and a jolly seahorse, right

He says that the process has been a 'great bonding experience'.

Kai even helped him ink recently and apparently loved getting in on the act.

'He's a pretty rad kid and it's a magical experience to share with him,' Keith said.

Keith's story recently came to light after images from photographer Chance Faulkner were posted online.

They show the father at home displaying Kai's original artwork alongside his own tattoos.

All of the details are perfectly matched, along with the color and shading.   

Keith says that he'll keep adding to his sleeve until his son tires of drawing for him.

He concluded: 'People ask me what will happen if I run out of space; I guess I'll just get him to draw smaller pictures.'
