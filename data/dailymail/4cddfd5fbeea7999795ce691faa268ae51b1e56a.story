The brother of a woman who was brutally beaten, raped and doused in petrol before her apartment was set on fire has revealed how she forgave her attacker during her astonishing recovery.

After Lydia Tillman, now 32, was attacked by Travis Forbes in Fort Collins, Colorado in July 2011, she suffered a stroke that left her in a coma for five weeks. Her jaw, wrist and ribs were also shattered.

Her brother Jacob, who is hoping to raise $65,000 for reconstructive jaw surgery for his sister, has spoken of her inspiring positivity in the face of these appalling injuries.

'Lydia first spoke about Travis Forbes before she 
was even able to speak,' he told MailOnline. 'She prepared a letter of forgiveness 
that our father read out in court and she hasn't looked back.

'She refuses to waste her time angry at him. Lydia's amazing but we all feel that way. There is no point wasting any time or anger on him because he's gone for good.'

Forbes, who was caught after his DNA was found under Lydia's fingernails, was sentenced to 48 years in prison after he admitted to the attack and the murder of another woman, Kenia Monge.

Jacob, a skateboarder and artist, recounted getting the call about his sister's attack as he was near the Rockies, around two hours from where Lydia had slipped into a coma at a Denver hospital.

'It was terrible,' he said. 'My sister Esther called me as I was at a rest stop. She told me Lydia had been attacked and and raped and that she was unconscious. I drove there right away.'

When he arrived at the hospital, he found his sister bloodied, bruised and with numerous tubes feeding into her broken body.

'She was so unstable they couldn't even take her off the temporary life support tubes to make her more comfortable,' he said. 'We didn't know if she was going to survive.'

Injuries: Lydia suffered a stroke after the horrific attack that left her in a coma for five weeks. Her jaw was shattered and she was left with a broken wrist and ribs

After Lydia suffered a stroke, the doctors put her in a medically induced coma to control the blood clot that was in an artery in her neck, just inches from her brain.

When she awoke after five weeks in the coma, she was unable to speak or walk.

'She was obviously the same sister I had known,' he said. 'You could tell she was obviously all there, but she couldn't speak at all.

'Even automatic sounds like laughing were silent - her shoulders jerked but there was no sound. She thought it was to do with tubes in her throat but it really was the brain injuries.'

After a few more weeks in hospital she was moved to a physical therapy unit where she spent three months re-learning how to walk and talk - and despite the grueling battle, she remained upbeat.

'She was very, very positive,' her brother remembered. 'She definitely gets frustrated at times and angry that this has happened to her but mostly she's just really positive.'

Speaking to NBC, her doctor  Rebecca Bearden added: 'I believe that Lydia shouldn't have 
survived that day. She 
went through so much and she probably shouldn't have made it but she 
did, and it was because of her determination and her joy.'

When Lydia left and moved in with her stepbrother and his family, she had mastered 10 words. She now lives independently and can say just as much as before the accident - with a little more effort.

'She's able to speak now but it takes a lot of concentration,' Jacob said. 'She knows what she wants to say but has to think about how to say it.'

The next step is for Lydia to undergo a special reconstructive jaw surgery in January. It will help her with speech development but costs a staggering $65,000.

Her insurance only pays for a procedure that would wire her jaw shut - a move which would reverse her speech therapy by stopping her from practicing words regularly, her brother said.

Help: Lydia's brother Jacob, a skateboarder and artist, hopes to raise $65,000 so for her jaw surgery

Jacob, who is based in New York, is now trying to raise the money for the operation with his Still Kickin' campaign. As well as accepting donations online, he also plans to hold fundraising events.

He has already received more than $24,000 from around 400 donations.

'She's really excited about this,' he added. 'She's moving on. She could have died but I'm so glad she was alive and that she could defeat this guy. She sees it that she won.'

Lydia managed to escape the attack, which occurred after Forbes followed her home from a July 4 celebration, by jumping from a window and hiding until emergency vehicles responded to the fire.

She ran towards an ambulance and when the paramedics asked whether she knew her attacker, she repeatedly told them 'No, no, no' before suffering the stroke.

Unknown to her, Forbes had killed 19-year-old Kenia Monge and hidden her body in a freezer just months earlier.

Case: Lydia stands with Nash Gurule, the Denver detective in the Monge case who connected the attackers

A detective in Denver investigating the murder heard of Lydia's story and realised the attacker had used bleach in both cases.

Authorities matched the DNA from under Lydia's nail to Travis Forbes, the suspect in Monge’s murder. A week later, he was arrested while walking a drunk college student home.

He confessed to both the assaults after prosecutors agreed to not to charge him under the death penalty. He was charged with murder and attempted murder, and was sentenced to life in prison.

Lydia was in a coma when he was arrested but later composed a statement to be read in court.

'Travis Forbes, you caused me no harm. My spirit, my soul and my mind remain untouched. May you find peace in this life,' it read.

She added to ABC: 'It was my intention to find the strength in my heart to forgive Travis Forbes. I did. I felt extreme anger toward him, then I felt sad for him. He must be in so much extreme pain to so brutally hurt another human.'
