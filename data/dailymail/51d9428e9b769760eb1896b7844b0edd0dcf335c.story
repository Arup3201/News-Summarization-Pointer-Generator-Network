Arrested: The prime suspect has been identified as 52-year-old Ariel Castro

The prime suspect in the astonishing kidnapping case of three women held captive for ten years posted a final message on Facebook saying: 'Miracles really do happen'.

Ariel Castro, 52, of Cleveland, Ohio, was arrested on Monday after one of his alleged victims escaped his home and called police and is now in custody along with his two brothers.

Neighbors in the street were shocked to hear that Castro, who was a school bus driver in the Cleveland area until last year, could be capable of abducting three innocent teenagers from the street and tying them up with chains in his basement.

Castro's Facebook page depicts a man with a passion for motorcycles and the bass guitar.

His last post to the social networking site on May 2 says: 'Miracles really do happen, God is good :)'

The man who came to Amanda Berry's rescue, Charles Ramsey, expressed disbelief that his neighbor could be capable of such a disturbed and shocking crime.

He told NewsNet5: 'I've been here a year. I barbeque with this dude, we eat ribs and what not and listen to salsa music. Not a clue that that girl was in that house or that anyone else was in there with.

'He just comes out to his backyard, plays with the dogs, tinkering with his cars and motorcycles and goes back in the house.

'He's somebody you look and then you look away because he's just doing normal stuff. You got some big testicles to pull this one off because we see this guy every day.'

Sources close to local station WOIO said the women were reportedly tied up during their captivity and police found chains hanging from one of the ceilings

They also reported there were signs that dirt had recently been moved in the backyard of the house, though police continue to investigate whether or not the dirt will lead to any new evidence in the case.

Alleged abductor: Ariel Castro was a local bus driver in the Cleveland area and was a quiet and mysterious figure in the neighborhood where no one really knew him well

Happy reunion: Amanda Berry (center) was all 
smiles at the Cleveland Hospital alongside her emotional sister (left) 
and a young girl that is believed to be the one who fled Ariel Castro's 
house with Berry

Found: Amanda Berry (left) and Gina DeJesus (right) were found alive in Cleveland on Monday following a decade-long search

Castro has lived in the house since 
1992. His two brothers - Pedro, 54, and O'Neal, 50, - do not live at the
 home but were arrested in connection with the three abductions.

Records
 show that Castro was arrested for domestic violence and disorderly 
conduct in December, 1993, though details of this are not yet available.

He was also stopped six times by Cleveland Police between 1995 and 2008 for traffic violations.

In a press conference today, it was 
revealed that police were called to the house in January 2004, after 
Castro left a child on his bus at the depot. They were not able to get anyone at the home and 
police did not follow up on it.

After an investigation, no criminal intent was found.

There are no other records of any violations or complaints in relation to the address.

He was a school bus driver in the 
area until November 2012, when he was let go after doing an illegal 
U-turn with children on the bus, according to the Cleveland Leader.

Prison: Castro has lived in the house since 1992. His two brothers - aged 50 and 54 - do not live there but have been arrested in connection with the girls' disappearance

Investigation: FBI agents remove evidence from the house where three women who had disappeared as teenagers approximately ten years ago, were found alive on Monday

Jannette Gomez, 50, who often visits 
family and friends on the street, said Castro would park his motorcycle 
and red pickup truck behind the house, lock the gate and enter the house
 through a back door.

Occasionally, he would turn on a dim 
porch light, but the house was always dark, she told The Plain Dealer. 
Shades blocked the windows, and at least one window was boarded up.

Gomez said he never had much to say, she said. He would say 'Hi' back, but there was never much conversation.

The
 county prosecutor joined dozens of police officers and sheriff's 
deputies at the scene as they began searching the house late on Monday.

Authorities say the women have been taken to a hospital to reunite with relatives and seem to be in good health.

Michelle Knight had been missing since 2002, Amanda Berry since 2003 and Gina DeJesus since 2004.

Remarkably, Castro's son - also named Ariel who 
now goes by 'Anthony' - penned an article for the Cleveland Plain Press 
about the disappearance of Miss DeJesus back in 2004 when he was a journalism student.

He even interviewed her mother for the piece, not knowing that the teen was tied up in a basement owned by his father.

He started the story with: 'Neighborhood residents have been taken by an overwhelming need for 
caution. Parents are more strictly enforcing curfews, encouraging their 
children to walk in groups, or driving them to and from school when they
 had previously walked alone.

'One thing is for certain, however. Almost everyone feels a connection 
with the family, and Gina’s disappearance has the whole area talking.'

Mother Nancy Ruiz told him at the time: 'You can tell the difference. People are watching out for each other’s kids.

'It’s a shame that a tragedy had to happen for me to really know my neighbors. Bless their hearts, they’ve been great.'

Anthony Castro told WKYC-TV reporter Sara Shookman yesterday: 'This is beyond comprehension … I’m truly stunned right now.'

Neighbor Juan Perez told News Channel 5 about Castro: 'He was a nice guy, he would come around and say hi. He gave the kids rides up and down the street on his four-wheeler'

Shocked: Neighbors were stunned to hear that Castro had three women locked in his basement as they thought he was a friendly but quiet guy

Also struck by the allegations, the suspects' uncle, Julio Castro, told CNN: 'I never want to see them again. For me, it's bad on one side and good on the other side.'

Julio Castro said his nephew used to play bass in various bands that 
performed at a local club once owned by DeJesus' uncle.

 - Neighbor Juan Perez

He said he 
believes his nephew knew the family from the club and the neighborhood.

Another neighbor Juan Perez told News Channel 5: 'He was a nice guy, he would come around and say hi. He gave the kids rides up and down the street on his four-wheeler.

'I’ve known him since I was like five or six years old myself, he would asked me if I wanted a ride. He seemed like he was a good guy to the kids that were here, I don't think he had any bad (attention).'

He also revealed that his sister once heard a scream come from the home and called police but nothing ever came of it. Looking back, he said, he should have seen the signs that something was not quite right.

'Now it's like, red-flag, red-flag, red-flag, somebody should've said something and my sister actually a few years ago heard a scream and she called police.

'He was a fun guy. I mean, parents trusted him. He talked to the parents. He was just a regular guy on the street. He put on that great mask that everyone thought he was a good guy.'

Police didn't immediately provide any
 details of how the women were found but said they appeared to be in 
good health and had been taken to a hospital to be reunited with 
relatives and to be evaluated.

They said a six-year-old also was found in the home.

On a recorded 911 call Monday, Amanda declared: 'I'm Amanda Berry. I've been on the news for the last 10 years.'

She
 said she had been taken by someone and begged for police officers to 
arrive at the home on Cleveland's west side before he returned. 

House of horrors: Only Castro is believed to have lived in the house where the women were found

Other case: Gina DeJesus went missing in 2004 on
 her way home from school, and her parents think that part of the reason
 why her case was not given much attention was because no Amber Alert 
was issued since no one actually saw the abduction take place

Scene: The women were helped out of this home on Seymour Avenue that belongs to Ariel Castro

'I've been kidnapped, and I've been missing for 10 years,' she told the dispatcher. 'And I'm here. I'm free now.'

Berry disappeared at age 16 on April 21, 2003, when she called her sister to say she was getting a ride home from her job at a Burger King.

DeJesus went missing at age 14 on her way home from school about a year later. They were found just a few miles from where they had disappeared.

Police said Michelle went missing in 2002 and is 32 now. They didn't provide current ages for the other two women.
