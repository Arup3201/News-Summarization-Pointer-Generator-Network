A coroner says a high school football player from western Pennsylvania who died after practice had a heart tumor.

An autopsy performed Thursday on the body of 16-year-old Noah Cornuet revealed the non-cancerous growth. The Allegheny County medical examiner's office ruled his death as being from natural causes.

Cornuet was a sophomore at Burrell High School in Lower Burrell, about 25 miles northeast of Pittsburgh.

First practice: Noah Cornuet died after running sprints on the first of three days of heat acclimatization football practice

The teen had reportedly just finished sprinting when he collapsed while walking off the field Wednesday evening.

Paramedics who attended practice immediately went to help Cornuet, who died about an hour later.

It was the team's first practice of the season.

The Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association last year began requiring schools to hold three days of practice to get players used to the heat before they're allowed to have contact drills.

The PIAA instituted the rule because of an increase in heat-related player deaths nationwide in recent years.

The high temperature Wednesday was about 80 degrees, with relatively mild humidity, not nearly as hot as the 90-degree days which often greet high school football players each August.

'The Burrell School District community recognizes the tragic loss of a student tonight,' a statement issued by Superintendent Shannon Wagner said.

The district has activated a crisis team and planned to support those who might be at the school for activities before classes begin August 25, the statement said.

Under the new PIAA rule, players were allowed to wear helmets and shoulder pads on Wednesday and Thursday, and full gear on Friday.

But there was to be no contact at those practices. Regular, full-contact practices were to begin Monday.
