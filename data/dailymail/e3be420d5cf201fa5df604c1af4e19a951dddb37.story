Whether it’s streaming countless episodes of The Walking Dead, or uploading super high-resolution photos, our desire for faster internet grows daily.

But despite the many benefits it can bring, experts are predicting a darker side to having superfast connections.

By 2025, as speeds soar, we could see the rise of holographic work colleagues, dubbed ‘cloud immigrants’, operating systems built inside the body, hackers causing havoc in the home, and precognition apps.

By 2025, as speeds soar, experts predict we could see the rise of holographic work colleagues, dubbed ‘cloud immigrants’ (pictured), that could increase competition for jobs. They also expect operating systems to be built inside the body, hackers to cause havoc in the home, and precognition apps

The predictions were made as part of Pew Research Centre’s Killer Apps in the Gigabit Age report.

It was commissioned to mark last year's 25th anniversary of the creation of the World Wide Web by Sir Tim Berners-Lee.

The report covers expert views about what impacts faster bandwidth speeds could have on the world, economies, work life and more.

‘Over the past few decades people have been sharing and accessing magnitudes more information online annually,’ explained the report.

‘In 2014, Google and Verizon were among the innovators announcing that they are testing the capabilities for currently installed networks to carry data even more efficiently - at 10 gigabits per second - to businesses that handle large amounts of Internet traffic.

‘To explore the possibilities of the next leap in connectivity we asked thousands of experts to share their thoughts about likely new activities and applications that might emerge in the gigabit age.

Gigabit connectivity (1,000 Mbps) is still limited globally, and although average speeds vary greatly, gigabit connections are 50-100 times faster than the average fixed high-speed connection. These speeds will advance current technologies, such as prediction apps like Google Now and Osito (pictured)

‘One interesting area of cognitive research is precognition, or things that lead to our responses or decisions before we act on them, even in the space of a nanosecond’ explained Annette Liska, director of design at a research firm. Google Now's predictive analysis already carries out a similar task

‘The expectation of most of the more than 1,460 people who participated in this canvassing of experts is that as this connectivity becomes more common, online life will be significantly changed.’

For example, as Marcel Bullinga, a technology futures speaker and futurist, explained: ‘No doubt the killer app will be real-life holograms operating in real time: for instance, as doctors, as surgeons, as coworkers.

‘It will change the workplace. Not only will it diminish the need for business travel, it will also increase competition.

‘Whereas before you had to compete with fellow humans in the same physical area, immigrants for example, in the future you have to compete with ‘cloud immigrants’ - coworkers appearing in their work as a hologram.’

LeapFrog’s learning designer Dr. Jody Sherman LeVos told MailOnline she believes in the future, pen and paper will be replaced with tablets, and apps will project onto a shared screen. Every student will be given wearables to monitor and promote physical activity throughout the day, and send stats to parents

LeapFrog’s learning designer Dr. Jody Sherman LeVos told MailOnline she believes in the future, pen and paper in classrooms will be replaced with tablets, and apps will project onto shared screens.

Every student will be given wearables to monitor and promote physical activity throughout the day, and these will send stats to parents and teachers.

Family web portals for close communication between parents and teachers, as well as between students, will develop further.

Students will be able to collaborate on homework, and parents will be able to talk to each other about workload and behaviour.

Dr Levos also thinks that students will soon be able to video conference with other classes around the world. This could lead to foreign exchange trips become virtual.

And voice recognition technology will be fitted in tablets and ebook readers to help children pronounce vocabulary and support second-language learning.

‘Teachers often struggle to deliver instruction at the right level for everyone in their class, given class sizes and varying competencies within their student population,’ explained Dr Levos.

‘Educational games can provide students with the concepts they need to learn, presented in fun and compelling ways, and with the types of support they need when they need it.

She said there is an emerging focus on skills that go beyond the core curriculum, including skills such as collaboration, grit and perseverance, music and creativity, and problem solving skills.

‘Technology can encourage and support numerous child development and educational objectives, such as physical activity and health.

‘And there is a body of research supporting the notion that children learn best when they’re having fun.

‘Simultaneously, there is a movement growing to ensure that children have access to, and understand how to, play.’

Judith Perrolle, a professor at Northeastern University, based in Boston, added: ‘The Internet of Things will take an ugly turn as hackers, cyber security swat teams, advertisers, and terrorists run amok through citizens' and nations' refrigerators, heating systems, power grids, and pacemakers.’

She predicts that this will see lawyers becoming specifically qualified to deal with product liability, and in turn switching the fault from the manufacturer to the machine.

‘Problems with rogue nanobots and genetically engineered diseases will dwarf concerns about the internet,’ she continued.

Design research consultant Anita Salem said: ‘The operating system will be integrated into the human body. I predict killer apps that control objects through thought.' She also believes such operating systems could lead to ‘super powers’ including X-ray vision, super hearing and mind control (X-Men's Professor X pictured)

Ms Liska continued that superfast speeds will help develop a tool that intelligently recognises 'our choices and behaviours'. She believes this will likely use sensors implanted in the body, that are only turned on when needed. This image shows the various parts that make up the MC10 electronic tattoo called the Biostamp

In 2013, former Federal Communications Commission Chairman Julius Genachowski issued a Gigabit City Challenge, urging all 50 US states to have at least one community with gigabit internet access by 2015 this year.

Gigabit connectivity (1,000 Mbps) is still limited globally, and although average speeds vary greatly, gigabit connections are 50 to 100 times faster than the average fixed high-speed connection.

These speeds will help advance current technologies, such as prediction apps like Google Now, Osito and Grokr.

‘One interesting area of cognitive research is precognition, or things that lead to our responses or decisions before we act on them, even in the space of a nanosecond,’ explained Annette Liska, director of unnnamed design firm in the report.

‘A tool that intelligently recognises our likely choices and behaviours, without overloading with information, then allows us to modify our choices based on a predictive outcome of those choices could play a key role in self-awareness, self-development, empathy, creativity, and our fundamental desire to feel connection to others’.

The experts did predict positive changes in terms of medicine and education to be brought about by superfast broadband. In particular, health monitoring will be ‘cheaper and more convenient’, and will be done at home rather than at hospitals. And robotic and remote surgery will become commonplace (illustrated)

She believes this will likely use sensors implanted in the body, that are only turned on when needed.

This is a prediction shared, somewhat, by design research consultant Anita Salem: ‘The operating system will be integrated into the human body.

‘I predict killer apps that control objects through thought - drug implants, virus detectors, stimulants and narcotics, virtual reality games, privacy and identity hiding tools, virtual pornography, robotic pets, robotic personal helpers, virtual wars, forced sterilizations, or birth control.

Futurist Peter Cochrane recently said he believes  technology is easing people away from ‘mass medicine and treatment’ into a more focused world of personalised medicine targeted at the individual, whether that be at home or in public hospitals.

Sensors will soon be able to relief pain, as well as detect cancer and other chemical inbalances in the body. 

Material, food, water and energy waste will be reduced thanks to the so-called Clouds of Things, where everything is tracked, has sensors, and can communicate with each other. 

And within 25 years, Mr Cochrane said jobs such as bankers, receptionists, call centre and warehouse operatives, will become redundant, with occupations such as 'cyborg engineers' and 'crime predictors' becoming common.

She also believes that human operating systems could lead to ‘super powers’ including X-ray vision, super hearing and mind control. 

The experts did also predict positive changes in terms of medicine and education that will be brought about by superfast broadband.

In particular, health monitoring will be ‘cheaper and more convenient’, and will be done at home rather than at hospitals, explained Hal Varian, chief economist at Google.

‘Indeed, the home security system will include health monitoring as a matter of course, [and] robotic and remote surgery will become commonplace.’

There is already a trend emerging, with doctors carrying out Skype consultations.

The experts also said that diets and treatments tailored to individuals based on their DNA, analysed on superfast computers with vast amounts of data being processed all the time, will revolutionise treatments and save lives.

Breanne Thomlison, founder and president of BTx2 Communications wrote: Tools will monitor us from birth and predict sickness and heal us faster.

‘Genetics will be patented and evolve to have cures to current and new disease that will arise. All of this will happen rapidly.’

She added that people will be able to connect with others who share similar DNA and experience a ‘personal connection to focus on prevention versus treatment’.

And, when it comes to education, she said there will be an app for every child's learning ability or disability: ‘Children will be learning and tracking 24/7, while sharing their experience with selected-in peers and networks.

'Everyone will be the media and a newsmaker. Journalism will be more personal and targeted.’
