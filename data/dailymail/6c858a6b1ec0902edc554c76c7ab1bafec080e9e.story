Zimbabwean despot Robert Mugabe says he is 'very lonely' since his political contemporaries died and complained that his Cabinet is full of 'children'.

In an interview with the state-controlled Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation to mark his 89th birthday, Mugabe said he had nobody left to share memories of the 1930s and Fifties or of years spent chasing girls.

He said that his colleagues were much more likely to listen to him than share ideas because they were too young to match his knowledge.

Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe has complained of being lonely now that his contemporaries are dead

The president, who is Africa's oldest leader, said that 78-year-old Didymus Mutasa, the minister for state for presidential affairs and the Zanu PF secretary for administration, was the only minister who could come close to sharing his experiences.

Politicians who were involved with the fight for independence alongside Mugabe, such as three consecutive vice-presidents Joshua Nkomo, Joseph Msika and John Nkomo, have since died in office.

Joshua Nkomo died in 1999, his successor Msika in 2009, while John Nkomo died of cancer in January this year.

Mugabe, who has ruled Zimbabwe since gaining independence from Britain in 1980, told ZBC that he looked down on his fellow politicians because of their relatively tender age.

He said: 'They have not had the same experience, the same length of life and, therefore, the same advantage of gathering as much knowledge and experience as yourself.

'And so you can't discuss with them things that happened in the 1930s or even 1950s.

'You take my Cabinet as it is: there is no one I can talk to about how we used to approach girls or we would go to this and that place, riding bicycles.

'There are others like Mutasa. He comes close, but others are just children.Â 

'You feel that loneliness. You have lost others and sometimes you think of it and it makes you very lonely.'

Mugabe, who is married to his 47-year-old former secretary Grace, told the broadcaster: 'The consoling part of it is that, well fine, there are young ones and young minds you can talk to.

'You can also try to educate, you can also try to relate a bit of history to and so on and so forth. But they remain young ones who listen much more than they share ideas with you.'

Mugabe's complaints may not be taken too seriously by some, reminded of the 2004 film Team America, where a puppet of the late North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il sings about his loneliness.

Minted: Dictator Robert Mugabe had the coins made to celebrate his 89th birthday

In the song, written by South Park and Book of Mormon creator Trey Parker, the puppet sings about having nobody to relate to while alone on his throne.

And the president clearly isn't too sad about his advancing years as he ordered gold coins to be made bearing his image to mark his 89th birthday and celebrated the day with a lavish party and four tier cake - at a time while Zimbabwe is one of the poorest countries in the world.
