A Virginia man has snagged a world record by catching a monster 'frankenfish' that clocked in at just under 17 and a half pounds.

Nicknamed frankenfish for its terrifying appearance and adaptability, the northern snakehead was caught back in June but Caleb Newton of Spotsylvania County has only now been confirmed the record holder.

The fiercely invasive Asian species has taken over waterways up and down the East Coast and is known to survive outside water for several days, but Newton, 27, said it only took him about a minute to reel the beast in.

Champion: Caleb Newton (pictured) caught this 17 pound, 6 ounce frankenfish in a Virginia tournament in June and the fish has now been deemed a world record

Beastly: The invasive species has been spotted from California to Massachusetts but most sightings of the fish that can live outside water for days occur near the Chesapeake Bay

Though getting it home was another matter. Newton told the Fredericksburg Free Lance-Star that the three foot, 17- pound 6-ounce fish barely fit inside his cooler.

The International Game Fish Association confirmed Monday that Newton, a plumber by trade, had beaten the previous record from 2004 in Miki Kagawa, Japan by two ounces.

‘How long it will hold up, I have no idea,’ Newton said.

Newton caught the champion fish in Aquia Creek, a tributary of the Potomac River, on June 1 in a tournament that had 15 other boats.

Growing threat: A map indicates where sightings have occurred. Experts believe the relentless species was introduced from its native Yangtze River through the Mid-Atlantic region. The first sighting occurred in Maryland

Adaptable: Even densely urban New York City has been affected. Signs near Central Park waterways warn anglers 'If you catch this fish, do not release'

Native to China, Russia, and Korea, the northern snakehead has been spotted from California to Massachusetts, with the densest populations found near the Chesapeake Bay, which is where the Newton’s whopper of a fish was caught.

Even New York City’s Central Park waterways are beginning to sag under the weight of the relentless species.

Signs have been erected along the park’s waterways by the Department of Environmental Conservation warning anglers who snag one of the unappealing fish not to throw it back but to hand it over.

'Secure the fish' and 'keep it in a secure container until it is picked up by officials,' the sign instructs.

Hungry: Experts fear the northern snakehead will out compete and decimate native fish as it eats everything in its path

A similar warning is posted on Maryland's Department of Natural Resources website.

Maryland manages the snakehead differently than Virginia, which prohibits commercial sales to avoid creating a market for the fish. Maryland encourages sales, maintaining that eating snakehead gives other fish a chance.

Wildlife specialists fear the invasive fish will out compete native species and wipe out other creatures as it eats everything in its path.

The gruesome-looking creature, which has snakelike head, is so disruptive that the state of New York prohibits possession, sale, and transport of the live fish and its eggs.

Plenty of other non-native fish have thrived in the United States, but few rival the northern snakehead: as long as three feet or more, the fish has a large, toothy mouth and can survive for days out of water, squirming and secreting a full-body slime. It is a delicacy in Asia and is gaining a following among chefs in the United States.

But for his part as a conqueror of the dreaded fish, Newton seemed unimpressed by his record catch.

‘I caught one 13 pounds on Saturday,’ he said. ‘And that one fought harder.’
