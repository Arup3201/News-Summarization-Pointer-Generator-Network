In a move reminiscent of LeBron's The Decision, the New York teen offered places at all eight Ivy League schools held a press conference on Wednesday to announce Yale was his choice.

Seventeen-year-old Kwasi Enin announced his eagerly awaited decision at William Floyd High School on Long Island and declared that Yale's music program is what swayed his decision.

The senior hit international headlines last month when he revealed he had been accepted to every single Ivy League college backed by his parents who are both nurses and emigrated to the United States from Ghana in the 1980s.

Success: Kwasi Enin, a high school senior, smiles after announcing he will attend Yale University during a press conference at William Floyd High School in Mastic Beach, New York on April 30, 2014

Decision: The high school senior made his choice out of all eight U.S. Ivy League schools that he was accepted to beforehand

Enin scored 2,250 out of 2,400 on his SAT. He was also accepted at Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania.

His incredible feat beat the odds - Harvard only accepted 5.9 percent of applicants in during this round and Cornell, which accepts more than the other seven schools, still only takes 14 percent.

Enin plans to study music and medicine and said of Yale, 'I met people who were just like me - diverse in both science and music - and they told me how manageable it is doing both.'

The teen said he is looking forward to singing in one of Yale's capella groups and playing in one of its orchestras.

Now that's high achievement: Kwasi Enin, 17 a senior at William Floyd High School in Shirley, New York, applied to all eight Ivy League Universities - and decided today to go to Yale

'I'm very satisfied with my offer,' he said of Yale. 'They're very generous on their aid.'

'A wrong decision can be the beginning or end to a lifestyle. In the seventh grade, I nearly ended my music career by opting to select a simple course- Music in Our Lives- that met the state music requirement, But this decision would have left me empty.

'While onstage as Big Jule of Guys and Dolls during my favorite musical, I helped create a wonderful atmosphere in the school auditorium by singing and dancing.

'With improvement and balance comes success, and music taught me all of these virtues.

'Whenever I perform... I become immersed in the conversations between performers and the audience.'

At the news conference in the school gym, Enin thanked his parents and educators who helped him along the way.

'Without their assistance, I would not be in this position,' he said to NBC New York. 'I would not have had the initial drive to strive for excellence.'

His mother said her son is 'proving himself to be on the right path.' She and her husband have sought to instill "strong moral qualities" in Enin and his sister since they were young, she said.

'We are so proud and so excited about all that he has achieved,' she said.

His father said he has always been strict about his children's academics.

'I told him, 'Look, your worst grade in school should be a 95,' he said.

Earlier this month, the admissions essay penned by Enin was released.

In the biographical statement he submitted for the Common Application, he wrote about how music is 'the spark of my intellectual curiosity' and helped him connect to his community through plays.

'While onstage as Big Jule of Guys and Dolls during my favorite musical, I helped create a wonderful atmosphere in the school auditorium by singing and dancing,' the essay reads.

Kwasi Enin matriculated at William Floyd High School, a large school on Long Island, New York. His principal said that, from the start, it was clear he would succeed

He goes on to tout his involvement in the local men's Doo Wop group as well as the chamber ensemble.

'With improvement and balance comes success, and music taught me all of these virtues,' he wrote.

'My haven for solace in and away from home is in the world of composers, harmonies and possibilities.'

'The self-guided journey known as music in my life excites my mind every day. My heart sings every day because the journey is already wonderful. Although I hope that my future career is in medicine, I love that I still have much to learn about and from the world of music.'

The 17-year-old from Long Island, who had already been accepted early into Princeton, got into Brown. Columbia, Cornell, Yale and Dartmouth on March 27.

Yale bound: Enin scored 2,250 out of 2,400 on his SAT. He was also accepted at Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania

By 5pm that day, he had six Ivy League colleges offering him a place at their institutions, and then the toughest of them all, Harvard, sent the William Floyd High School student an email.

The university has an acceptance rate of only 5.9 per cent - meaning only 2,023 of the 34,295 applicants will get in - and they wanted Kwasi.

'I was like - this can't be happening!' Kwasi told Newsday.

He told The New York Post that much of his success is a result of his hovering 'helicopter parents', who both work as nurses after moving to America from Ghana in 1980.

'He's an amazing kid. He's very humble,' his father Ebenezer Enin said.

'He's been trained to be a high achiever right from when he was a kid.

'We have been encouraging him to be an all-around student. So far, he has proved himself.'
