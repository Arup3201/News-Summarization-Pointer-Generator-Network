 

Having wrapped up the world’s largest human migration, the Spring Festival season, China is the scene for a breathtaking animal migration this week.

Stunning images from The People’s Daily Online show  herdsmen transferring 400,000 livestock in knee-deep snow and blizzards in north-west China.

Covering more than 300 kilometres (186 miles), the annual animal migration started late last week and is expected to last ten days.

Harsh weather: A herdsman drives sheep on a snow-covered path in Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture

Strong will: Most of the herdsmen are ethnic residents, such as Kazakhs, who are moving their livestock to spring pastures

Long march: The animal migration covers more than 300 kilometres and is expected to last for 10 days

Far flung: The images were taken in the most north-western part of China near the Kazakhstan border

The extreme journey takes place in the remote Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in north-west China.

Ethnic herdsmen must move livestock - consisting mainly of sheep and horses - from the winter pasture in Bortala Mongol Autonomous Prefecture southwards to the grassland in Ili, where the animals will spend spring.

The journey follows a passage through Guo Zi Gou, one of China’s most beautiful gorges and a key section on the Silk Road.

Animal adventure: The livestock among the 400,000 animals on the move include sheep and horses 

The massive migration is a major task for  local administrations.

Snow has to be ploughed in advance and emergency forage is arranged in several key locations along the way.

Xinjiang is one of the country’s strongest regions for animal husbandry. There are approximately 57.2 million livestock in the province in total.

All prepared: Local authorities have arranged snowploughs and emergency foraging for the animals along the way

Almost there: Herdsmen are expected to complete the challenging task by the end of the week
