An electrician died after his car crashed into an ambulance which had stopped to attend another road accident.

Jonathan Burke, 21, was taken to hospital following the accident on Sunday morning in Washington, Tyne and Wear, where he later died.

Paramedics were attending to passengers in a Vauxhall Astra which had struck a lamppost when Mr Burke’s Renault Clio hit the stationary ambulance at the junction of the A1231 and A195 in Barmston.

Two fire engines were called to the second accident at 7.30am and crews used cutting equipment to rescue Mr Burke from the car.

He was placed on a spinal board and taken to Sunderland Royal Hospital, where he died in the afternoon.

Four passengers from the Astra who suffered minor injuries, were also taken to hospital.

His family paid tribute to him today in a statement released through the police.
