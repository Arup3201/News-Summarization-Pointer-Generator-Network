TV detective: John Nettles, pictured filming Bergerac in Jersey, was sent hate mail after appearing in a documentary about the occupation of the island

Bergerac star John Nettles seemed the perfect choice to present a documentary on the history of Jersey after spending many years filming scenes for the hit TV series on the idyllic island.

But the actor, who is still well remembered for playing the TV detective for a decade from 1981, has revealed how he was outcast by his friends for being involved in the three-part expose about the Nazi occupation of Jersey during the Second World War.

At the time Nettles had no idea that the show would receive such a hostile reception from the islanders and thought it would be an interesting chance to learn more about the island he had spent so much time in.

But shortly after the show was aired he found himself being ostracised by former friends on the island and the recipient of threatening letters and hate mail.

He told the Daily Express: 'The islanders didn't like the way we talked about the resistance, didn't like the way we talked about the collaboration or allegations of it and they didn't like the way we talked about the treatment of the Jews by the administration of the islands.'

Despite the animosity caused by the Channel Islands at War documentary, it inspired Nettles to continue researching the subject and he is now releasing a book that goes into the Nazi occupation of Jersey in more detail.

Nettles, now 69, knew that many would be unhappy about the project, but decided the story needed to be told.

He said: 'There came a point when I thought, either I don't tell this story and keep my friends or I tell it and lose them all.'

The Channel Islands - comprising of Jersey, Guernsey, Alderney, Sark and Herm - were the only part of Britain ever to fall under Nazi rule during the Second World War.

Winston Churchill felt the islands were impossible to defend and many residents were forced to flee to mainland Britain.

Those who remained were left to fend for themselves under a strict German regime with Jersey occupied from July 1, 1940, until May 9, 1945. Many were left completely isolated with limited rations and no way of escape.

Nettles said: 'It is the story of a sustained and wholesale attack on human values, of great suffering, venality and violence.'

But some islanders fared better than others during the occupation with Nettles noting that the Dame of Sark, Sybil Hathaway, invited invading German officers to a lobster dinner.

This was one of many examples later investigated by the British government as possible collaboration with the Nazis.

Nettles points out that many were left with little choice but to obey the Nazi occupiers as they had no way of escaping and hardly any weapons.

But their co-operation in producing a list of residents and details of their birth aided the Germans in identifying Jewish residents who were then transported to concentration camps.

Nettles added: 'The Jewish question in the Channel Islands is one of the most difficult to address. People are deeply, deeply hurt by accusations that they are anti-Semitic, or that they were too much inclined to load the Jews on to the transporters.'

Although Nettles also highlights heroic acts of bravery where residents helped to hide Jewish friends and escaped Russians and save them from the Nazi death camps.
