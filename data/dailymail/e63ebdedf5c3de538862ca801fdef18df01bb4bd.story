A Facebook page inviting people to post amusing comments they claim to have heard in an up-market supermarket chain has become an internet hit.

The woes, trials and tribulations of the ever-expanding British middle-class are being posted on the site, apparently just as they were heard uttered by people while doing their weekly food shop.

The remarks by shoppers often with their children in tow, are both cringe making and hilarious in equal measures.

The Facebook page, which is described as 'A page for publishing words often heard permeating the aisles of Britain;s poshest supermarket', has already gained 120,799 likes since it was launch ed three days ago

The Duchess of Cambridge was snapped heading into her local Waitrose when she was living on the island of Anglesey with William in 2011 while he was worked as an RAF search and rescue pilot

HRH The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall also visited Waitrose, which has long been a favourite among affluent shoppers

With quotes revolving around the 
purchasing of gourmet, expensive foods and the difficulties of managing a 
life of privilege, the page has gone viral online with 120,000 â€˜likesâ€™ 
since being launched just three days ago.

People often joke that Waitrose is the 'posh persons' supermarket' and lines that are said to have been overheard include: 'Hurry up with the focaccia darling, that man's coming to clean the pool soon' and 'Daddy, does Lego have a silent tea, like Merlot'

Oh and that terrible problem of having to keep up with numerous properties is covered too with 'Darling, do we need parmesan for both houses?

The site, which should possibly be taken with a pinch of only the very best sea salt, is the latest to gain attention online through mocking the middle classes with Twitter accounts such as 'Middle Class Problems'  also gaining a huge following.
