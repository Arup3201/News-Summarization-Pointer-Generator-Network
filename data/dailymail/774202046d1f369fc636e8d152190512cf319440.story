New clerk: Carol Mills, who runs the Department of Parliamentary Services in Canberra Australia, was headhunted for the UK role

David Cameron is being urged by MPs to block the appointment of an Australian woman as the next ‘chief executive’ of the Commons.

Carol Mills, who currently runs the Department of Parliamentary Services in Canberra, has won the battle to become the new £200,000 Clerk of the Commons – despite claims that her selection amounts to nothing more than ‘political correctness’ by Speaker John Bercow.

Ms Mills – privately dubbed ‘Waltzing Matilda’ by critics of her selection – was chosen by a panel chaired by Mr Bercow after being tapped up by headhunters and flown to the UK at taxpayers’ expense.

Under normal circumstances it would now be a formality for the Prime Minister to formally recommend her to the Queen as the next Clerk.

But Tory MPs, who complain that the ‘best candidate’ for the job, the current deputy clerk David Natzler, has been unfairly passed over, have urged Mr Cameron to ‘pause’ the process.

Last night Tory MP Simon Burns said: ‘Given that there was an in-house candidate who was eminently qualified to do the job, this is bizarre.

‘If this is Bercow’s idea of political correctness – to have a woman – then it’s absolutely staggering.’

He was backed by fellow Tory MP Rob Wilson, who said: ‘Ms Mills undoubtedly has her merits and I have no reason to doubt she has performed her very different role as head of the staff of the Australian Parliament in an exemplary way.

‘But I know my colleagues are very concerned that the role of the Clerk of Commons, one of the most important and powerful officials in Parliament, should not be pushed through without the proper consultation and scrutiny of MPs.’

Mr Wilson added: ‘I believe the Prime Minister might wish to at least pause the process while the House of Commons isn’t in session so that he can hear the views and concerns of MPs from across the House before fundamental and probably irreversible changes are made.

'Politically correct': Some Tory MPs implied that Ms Mills was chosen instead of the UK favourite because she is a woman

‘It is important that any notable reform is made with the widest possible consent.’

Ms Mills, who will replace the popular bewhiskered figure of Sir Robert Rogers as Clerk, is also entitled to a five-bedroom grace-and-favour house in Westminster as part of her employment package.

One Commons source said: ‘She is a radical break with the past, a proper chief executive figure who enjoys hard rock and modern art – not playing the church organ in Herefordshire like Sir Robert.’

The Speaker’s office last night declined to comment.

But a source close to Mr Bercow insisted the decision was taken by the whole panel, saying: ‘It was a consensus decision.’
