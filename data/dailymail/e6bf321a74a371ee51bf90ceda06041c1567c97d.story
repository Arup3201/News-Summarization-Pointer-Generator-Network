Chef Andrew Wright cheated nearly 200 victims after creating up a fake company which fleeced pensioners out of their life savings

A fraudster who conned more than £1.25 million out of elderly and vulnerable people and then spent five years on the run has finally been brought to justice.

Chef Andrew Wright cheated nearly 200 victims after creating up a fake company which fleeced pensioners out of their life savings.

When detectives began investigating his dealings in 2009 he fled from Spain, where he co-ran the firm with an accomplice, to Malaysia.

The 64-year-old evaded arrest until May last year when he was detained at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam. 

He had flown into the country for a catering trade show and his name flagged up under a European arrest warrant. 

Derby Crown Court was told the company CGI, which used a UK address, cold-called elderly and vulnerable people and asked them to invest in fraudulent businesses.

They lied about their achievements and prospects for making profits and raked in a total of £1,267,724 through the con. From this huge sum, CGI benefitted £480,000.

The conmen made people believe they were speaking to someone from a company based in the UK and not in Spain.

Between November 2007 and August 2009, CGI made about 43,000 calls to 12,500 numbers, which equated to about 31 days of time on the phone.

But in 2009 the Derbyshire force began investigating the fake firm and both Wright and Hogan fled the country.

A European arrest warrant was issued for Wright in April 2012, but it was another two years before he was caught. Arrest warrants are flagged up at passport control and the fraudster was arrested by Dutch border guards after his jet touched down last May.

Wright, who contested the warrant, was kept in Dutch custody until being brought over to the UK in August.

He admitted conspiring to defraud together with Paul Hogan, who is still on the run, between November 2007 and August 2009, and has been jailed for four years and eight months.

Following the case, Detective Constable Rich Foster, of Derbyshire police's economic crime unit, said: 'This was a long, painstaking investigation into a fraud that left nearly 200 victims across the country, including Derbyshire, facing serious financial losses.

'Our pursuit of this criminal in a number of countries and over several years proves how seriously we take this kind of offence, and I'm pleased that we have been able to bring one of the ringleaders in this operation to justice.'

DC Foster, who was the investigating officer in the case, said in 2009 a restraint order was put on Wright's bank account, which contained thousands of pounds.

'So he knew at this point we wanted to speak to him and he fled to Malaysia,' said DC Foster.

The officer said the fraud had been devastating to many people.

'All the victims were vulnerable - the majority elderly - and some have lost their life savings, their pension schemes or been persuaded to cash in previous investments and shares which were genuine to pay for these fraudulent ones,' said DC Foster.

'Others took out bank loans to get the money.'

He said that many of the victims felt foolish for having been drawn in by Wright and his accomplice.

DC Foster said: 'They very much feel ashamed that they have been persuaded to do this when they should have known better, and embarrassed that they were taken in, but they were professional fraudsters who knew what they were doing and saying.'

DC Foster said they had begun the process to extradite Wright's partner in the fraud, Hogan, who was originally from the UK but now believed to be living in Australia.

Jailing Wright, of no fixed address but previously of Derbyshire, for four years and eight months, Judge John Burgess said: 'It was a classic boiler room fraud. It was sophisticated.

'The company fell to pieces in 2009, no doubt because authorities in this country were on to you and it became very much more difficult to find customers wanting to invest. You went to Malaysia and worked there.'

The judge said that Wright, who previously worked as a chef in Derby, must have taken 'a degree of care' to make sure the authorities did not find him.

Judge Burgess said the fact Wright contested the warrant made him take a 'somewhat cynical' view of Wright's expressions of remorse in his letter to the judge.

Philip Bown, in mitigation, said that before Wright had been detained last year he had not known that a European arrest warrant had been issued.

Mr Bown said: 'He has led a law-abiding and fairly successful life in the food industry - that's where his expertise lies. He has travelled widely and has been employed all over the world and has a hard work ethic.'

The lawyer told the court that the fraudulent venture of CGI had been the one blip in his client's hard-working career and that he had been 'seduced by the money'.

In his letter to the judge, Wright wrote: 'The more intricate the web around you, the more difficult it is to get out.'
