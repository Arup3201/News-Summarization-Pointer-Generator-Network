Louis van Gaal's first competitive game as Manchester United manager ended in defeat as Swansea spoiled the Old Trafford party.

Midfielder Ki Sung-yueng put the Swans ahead, and despite Wayne Rooney's acrobatic equaliser, United fell to defeat after Gylfi Sigurdsson scored from close range.

Sportsmail's Chris Wheeler gives his opinion on the performances from both sets of players.

Winner: Gylfi Sigurdsson celebrates close range strike that made sure Louis van Gaal's first game ended badly

Lost: United's players look dejected after Swansea take the lead for the second time

Delight: The players celebrate going ahead at Old Trafford against the run of play

Manchester United

DAVID DE GEA 5.5 – Had little chance with the first goal but will disappointed he didn’t keep out the second with two attempts

PHIL JONES 6 – Blocked out by Bony for Ki’s goal but came to United’s rescue with some fantastic tackles towards the end

CHRIS SMALLING 5.5 – Needs to impose himself on the game more. Indecisive and hesitant on the ball on occasions

TYLER BLACKETT 6.5 – Composed Premier League debut. Looked more comfortable on the ball than both Smalling and Jones at times

JESSE LINGARD 6 – Unlucky to be forced off after 24 minutes after a bright start although injury looked a lot worse at first

DARREN FLETCHER 6.5 – Did his job well but players around him lacked the creativity to open up Swansea

Lacking: Darren Fletcher worked hard but never found the creativity needed to unlock Swansea's defence

ANDER HERRERA 6 – Still getting to grips with the pace of the English game and was caught in possession.

ASHLEY YOUNG 5.5 – Promising going forward but defensively suspect again as he lost Routledge in the build-up to second goal

JUAN MATA 6 – Can still give so much more. Wasted a couple set-pieces by putting them too close to the keeper

JAVIER HERNANDEZ 5 – Largely anonymous performance showed why he will probably be on his way. Replaced by Nani at half-time

WAYNE ROONEY 6.5 – Couple of ambitious efforts in the first half but new skipper got United back on terms with the equaliser 

Level: Rooney leaps to slam home an overhead kick and level the score at 1-1

Captain fantastic: Rooney celebrates finding the net n his first game as permanent captain

Substitutes:

Januzaj (for Lingard 24), Nani (for Hernandez 46), Kagawa, Fellaini (for Herrera 67), M Keane, Amos, James.

Scorer: Rooney 53 

Manager: Louis van Gaal – 5.5

Impact: Janujaz made something of a difference in the second half, but it wasn't enough for United

Work to do: It was a difficult start for United's new boss, who will have to rethink his 3-5-2 formation

Swansea City 

LUCASZ FABIANSKI 6.5 – Must have though he would be tested more by United but reliable when required

ANGEL RANGEL 6.5 – Typically strong performance from him at right-back, subduing both Young and then Januzaj down the United left

JORDI AMAT 7 – Got in a couple of important blocks and looked solid alongside Williams

Solid: Jordi Amat stops Wayne Rooney getting away, during an encouraging performance at the back

ASHLEY WILLIAMS 7.5 – Made some fantastic interceptions, not least when Rooney looked as though he was through in the second half

NEIL TAYLOR 5.5 – Rash challenge on Januzaj earned him a booking and replaced eight minutes after the restart

JONJO SHELVEY 6.5 – Great job shielding the Swansea defence and then launching the breakaway attacks

KI SUNG-YEUNG 7 – Helped keep United at bay and got forward to take his chance really well

Opener: Ki had put Swansea ahead in the first half with a well-placed finish

NATHAN DYER 6.5 – Energetic performance summed up by fne run in the build-up to the first goal

GYLFI SIGURDSSON 8 – Match-winning display. Kept his cool to score the second goal from close range, having played a part in the first goal as well. 

Get in: Gylfi Sigurdsson finds the net from close range to win the game for Swansea

WAYNE ROUTLEDGE 6.5 – A real threat down the right for Swansea even though his cross for the second goal was actually a shot

WILFRIED BONY 7 – A real handful for the Unite defence throughout. They never quite got to grips with the big man. 

Handful: Bony may not have got on the scoresheet but he was a constant thorn in the side of united's defence

Subs: Gomis (for Bony 77), Tiendalli (for Taylor 53), Montero (for Dyer 67), Tremmel, Bartley, Richards, Sheehan.

Manager: Gary Monk – 7 

Scorers: Ki 28, Sigurdsson 72

Booked: Dyer, Taylor, Shelvey

Referee: Mike Dean 7 

Star man: Gylfi Sigurdsson
