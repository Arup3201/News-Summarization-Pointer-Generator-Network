England's Young Lions will play their full part during the international break with the Under 20s, Under 19s and Under 18s all in action both at home and around Europe.

Aidy Boothroyd has selected a 22-strong squad for the Under 20's double-header of friendlies against Canada at the Goldsands Stadium in Bournemouth and Portugal in Coimbra.

Chelsea starlet Lewis Baker will return to captain the side after his call-up to Gareth Southgate's Under 21 squad for their European Championship Play-offs last month.

He will be aiming to continued the good form when they take on Canada in Bournemouth on Wednesday November 12 and Portugal on Monday November 17.

Sean O'Driscoll, meanwhile, has kept faith with the 16-man Under 19s squad that recently cruised through preliminary qualifying for the European Championships.

They take on Italy at the New York Stadium in Rotherham on Friday November 14 and among a talented squad are Chelsea's Izzy Brown, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Alex Kiwomya, Fulham's Patrick Roberts and MK Dons' Dele Alli.

O'Driscoll said: 'There is an exciting pool of talent in this age group. Despite what people say about English footballers, on a technical level the players in this age group are as good as anything that's out there in any country in the world.

'This is testament to the excellent work going on in the club academies where the players are nurtured.'
