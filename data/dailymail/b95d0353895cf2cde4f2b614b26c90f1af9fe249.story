Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore has warned that the Football Association's proposal for Premier League B teams to be entered into the football league would decimate and damage English football.

FA chairman Greg Dyke revealed plans to allow B teams made up of young professionals to be entered into a new division where they will face teams at Conference level in an attempt to address the lack home-grown British players reaching the top level.

Scudamore has conceded that Dyke is right to address the problem, but insisted that there are other solutions than the one the FA has presented.

Concerned: Premier League CEO Richard Scudamore believes B teams would damage the Football League

'I have some real concerns we shouldn’t be looking to infiltrate and damage the pyramid and therefore I would like to think we should exhaust all other options, all other ideas,” he told the Guardian.

'The commission report has hit upon an issue that we are all faced with – a big challenge as to how do you take this huge investment that we make in youth up to the age of 18? How do you get all that talent through and convert it into first-team players able to hold their own in the Premier League and able to compete for England?

'That’s a challenge we recognise. We know we have to address it and we are going to sit down and yet again re-examine everything we do in terms of trying to overcome that challenge.

'So I have no issue with the identification of, if you like, ‘the problem’, but I have been on record very recently as saying I think the English pyramid is one of our unique strengths and I would like to think we would be able to come up with a solution which doesn’t mean the decimation or the infiltration or the damage really of something precious.'
