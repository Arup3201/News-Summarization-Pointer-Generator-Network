The first Iditarod musher hit the trail in unseasonably warm conditions yesterday as the legendary sled race kicked off in Alaska.

Temperatures were in the high teens as'The Last Great Race on Earth' began, but even that seemed a little on the summery side for seasoned mushers as Alaska experiences one of its warmest winters on record.

'Too warm for dogs,' said competitor Eric Noble of Eagle River, Alaska.

In addition to the relative warmth, a slew of foreign born competitors from as far afield as Jamaica and Australia are among this year's competitors.

New Zealander Curt Perano began 
the world's most
famous sled-dog race by crossing frozen Willow Lake about 50 miles north
 of Anchorage in a race some locals say has been 'invaded' by foreigners
 this year.

Five Norwegian mushers are competing this year along with the Kiwi starter, all of them facing 1,000 miles of unforgiving Alaska terrain, including two
mountain ranges, untamed wilderness, the mighty Yukon River and the
wind-whipped Bering Sea coast.

It was a staggered start, meaning one musher left every two
minutes. The order was drawn at a musher's banquet Thursday night in Anchorage.

The finish line is on Front Street in Nome, which runs
parallel to the Bering Sea coast.

Among those in the field are Mitch Seavey, last year's
champion, and his son, Dallas Seavey, the 2012 winner.

‘The last two winners might create more media interest,’
Dallas Seavey said before the race started. ‘But it doesn't mean that we're
necessarily the two most competitive racers this year.’

Adding to the uncertainty of this year's race is an influx
of Scandinavian mushers, including two-time champion Robert Sorlie.

‘I don't think we're trying to take it over,’ Sorlie said.

Instead, there are so many Scandinavians here because the
Iditarod is the world standard for long-distance dog races, he said.

The influx of Norwegians, or ‘invasion’ as Yvonne
Dabakk of Oslo described it, is likely just a coincidence, she said.

Unseasonably warm: A sled dog takes advantage of unseasonably warm temperatures to get some sun from the hole in a kennel on a musher before the race began Sunday. Some fear the warmth will make for a grueling race

Dabakk said she believes all had independent plans to race
the Iditarod, ‘and it was this year.’

She is a rookie this year, and she wants the prize given to
all first-year mushers to finish the race: a belt buckle.

If she gets it, the buckle goes to her husband. ‘Without
him, I couldn't be on the trail line at all, so I'm going to get him a buckle,’
Dabakk said.

Aaron Burmeister wants to be the first musher from Nome to
win the Iditarod.

We haven't had a winner from Nome yet. I'm working as hard
as I can to be able to do that,’ he said.

Burmeister welcomes the return of the Norwegian mushers
because they bring more competition to the race.

‘When I win the Iditarod, I want to have the best
competition in the world there,’ Burmeister said.

Mushers to beat: Defending champion Mitch Seavey talks with others before the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race got under way Sunday. Previous to his win, his son Dallas won the race in 2012

The trail conditions could prove to be an advantage for one
musher's wife.

Allen Moore of Two Rivers, Alaska, last month won his second
consecutive Yukon Quest International Sled Dog Race. The conditions now are the
same as they were for the start of the Quest, he said.

His wife, musher Aliy Zirkle, will be using this team on the
race while Moore races other dogs.

Zirkle has finished second in the Iditarod the last two
years, and her team might give her the needed boost this year because trail
familiarity in the Yukon Quest.

‘Our dogs have gone over 1,000 miles, and they know what to
expect,’ Moore said

Newton Marshall of St. Anne, Jamaica, is another
international musher at the race. He's competing in his fourth Iditarod.

Marshall's race strategy is simple: He just wants to finish
the race. He plans to take it slow and simple ‘and get to Nome,’ he said.

When asked how his team looks, Marshall said: ‘My team looks
... I'll find out on the trail.’

World class: Fans line up along the course for the start of the Iditarod, considered by most to be the gold standard of all long-distance dog sled races. That prestige has attracted racers from around the world this year

The Sunday event in Willow followed a ceremonial start
Saturday in downtown Anchorage. At that fan-friendly event, mushers talked to
people and had their pictures taken for hours before taking their sleds on a
leisurely 11-mile (18-kilometer) run on urban trails in the city.

The race turned serious Sunday. The Iditarod had a
late-afternoon start so fans from Fairbanks could get there.

It was a beautiful day for fans at the restart of the race,
with temperatures in the high teens.

‘Too warm for dogs,’ said Eric Noble of Eagle River, Alaska.

Noble and his wife and son have attended for years because
they help musher Jessie Royer.

Another fan at the race, volunteering to work security, was
Adam Redmon of Waynesville. N.C.

Redmon said he and his wife put bucket-list vacation ideas
into a teapot.

‘We just reached in there New Year's and picked it out,’ he
said. ‘It was just meant to be.’

The colder temperatures didn't bother Redmon, who will
graduate with a business administration degree in May. He started college after
serving in the military.

‘It's been colder back home,’ he said. ‘Golly, I'm not even
wearing gloves.’
