Police have released shocking images 
of a car damaged by a concrete block that yobs hurled from a bridge, 
leaving a woman fighting for her life.

The 57-year-old victim was in a 
serious but stable condition in hospital last night after suffering head
and chest injuries when the block fell  on to the Nissan on the A12 
near Galleywood in Essex.

Her 56-year-old husband – who was driving at the time – escaped with minor injuries.

Second attack: The interior of the Nissan which was hit by a second concrete block last Thursday on the same stretch of road. A 57-year-old woman is still in hospital after that attack

Smashed: The full extent of the damage to the Nissan car and shattered windscreen can be seen here. Police are treating both attacks as attempted murder

A similar incident occurred 40 minutes
earlier under Fryerning Lane Bridge near Ingatestone when a Vauxhall 
Astra had its windscreen smashed.

The
occupants, a mother and daughter aged 48 and 26, from Brentwood, 
escaped unharmed. They were driving to Chelmsford after a day's 
Christmas shopping at Lakeside Shopping Centre, when the block struck.

Essex Police say the 2ft block, which
smashed through the windscreen, may have been used as a bollard at a 
nearby house. Officers also revealed the perpetrators may have used a 
vehicle to bring the heavy block to the bridge.

The attack took place at about 10pm 
on Thursday, less than an hour after  a similar incident in which a 
Vauxhall Astra’s windscreen was smashed by  a concrete block thrown from
another bridge on the A12 in nearby Ingatestone. A 48-year-old woman 
and her 26-year-old daughter escaped unharmed. Police are now treating 
both attacks as attempted murder.

Scene of attack: Police on West Hanningfield Bridge over the A12, where the second concrete block was thrown onto a Nissan car

Appeal: Police and press at West Hanningfield Bridge in Essex after the attack on December 1

Officers are examining clues from  a forensic examination of both bridges. Detectives are also looking into more than 30 similar incidents from the past three years to identify any links.

The force has increased patrols  in the area and is appealing for information from the public.

Detective Chief Inspector Keith Davies said: ‘Even a stone thrown from a bridge can be fatal, but  when you look at the size of this concrete, it is amazing that the consequences were not far,  far worse.’
