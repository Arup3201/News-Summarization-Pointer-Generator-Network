Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Liverpool have won five and lost just one of the last nine  Premier League meetings with Sunderland.

Seven of the last 11 goals Liverpool have scored against the Black Cats were netted by Luis Suarez (and two by Daniel Sturridge).

Sunderland have won none of their last 15 league trips to Anfield (W0 D7 L8).

Last season, Brendan Rodgers’ side scored 20 Premier League goals during December with 10 of them scored by Luis Suarez.

No English player has scored more Premier League goals in 2014 than Steven Gerrard (13; level with Wayne Rooney and Daniel Sturridge).

Nicklas Bendtner celebrates scoring the only goal of the game in Sunderland's last win over Liverpool during a Premier League clash at the Stadium of Light in March 2012

The Liverpool captain has scored one and assisted three more in his last three league games against Sunderland.

Liverpool are looking to win three league games in a row for the first time since their unlikely spell of 11 successive wins earlier in the year.

Lee Cattermole has been booked in five of his last six Premier League appearances.

Each of Liverpool’s last five Premier League goals have been scored by five different Englishmen.

Liverpool’s players have made 20 errors leading directly to a goal or attempt this season, more than any other side.
