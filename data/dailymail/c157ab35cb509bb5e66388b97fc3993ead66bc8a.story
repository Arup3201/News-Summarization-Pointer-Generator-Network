New Orleans police say a drag queen is now behind bars for allegedly causing the death of a man by injecting him with consumer grade silicone to help him look more like a woman.

Armani Nicole Davenport, 33, whose birth name is Larry T. Bernard, allegedly injected silicone into the buttocks and hips of Breneisha Hall, 25, born Brad Hall, leading to the woman's death.

Armani Nicole Davenport, 33, whose birth name is Larry T. Bernard, turned herself in at NOPD headquarters.

The procedure took place on October 24 at a house in the 1200 block of Salcedo Street.Â

Following the injection, Hall began having trouble breathing, and was rushed to Interim LSU Hospital.

She fell into a coma and died two months later on January 1.

It is the first case of its kind in New Orleans, although deaths caused by illegal injections have been reported in several states across the country.

NOPD homicide detectives last week looked for Davenport at her Baton Rouge home, but could not find her.

Police said in a statement that Davenport, 'travels the southeast gay pageantry circuit and has won several titles and is also practicing medical procedures without proper credentials.'

Homicide detectives secured an arrest warrant for Davenport on one count of negligent homicide.

She was jailed in November with negligent injuring, a misdemeanor, and released.

But
 her charge was upgraded after the Orleans Parish coroner's office ruled
 Hall's death a homicide two weeks ago, after it was initially ruled to 
have resulted from natural causes.

'It's a foreign body, and it was injected into her body,' John Gagliano, the coroner's chief investigator, said at the time. 'You can't just walk around and give anyone an injection.'

Hall's death initially was ruled to have resulted from natural causes by doctors at Interim LSU Hospital, who performed an autopsy.

Gagliano said that the coroner's office reversed the initial findings after reviewing thousands of pages of medical records, re-examining the results of the initial autopsy conducted by doctors at University Hospital, and performing further examinations.

She was buried on January 11.

There have been other reports across the country of men getting illegal injections of silicone from hardware stores to enlarge their breasts and other body parts as they attempt to appear more like a woman.
