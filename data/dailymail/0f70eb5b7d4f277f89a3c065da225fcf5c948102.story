A 16-year old Holocaust survivor and her family escaped death after finding refuge with the sister of Belgium's most notorious Nazi leader.

Hana Nadel, now 86, was taken in by Madeline Cornet - her brother Leon Degrelle once famously claimed that Hitler told him 'If I had a son, I wish he'd resemble you.'

Degrelle was a leader of the Belgian Nazi Rexen movement which were responsible for deporting Jews to their deaths in World War Two during the German occupation of Belgium.

Ms Nadel, who now lives in Israel, explained they had been thrown out of their Brussels home when her mother noticed a sign on Madeline Cornet's door asking for help.

After ringing the bell and meeting Mrs Cornet, all three women were hired - Ms Nadel's mother became a cook and the two younger girls were housemaids.

She said the couple quickly realised that she was Jewish as she had 'pretty dark skin.'

Ms Nadel said she dodged talking 
about the subject as long as possible, but when she was asked directly she told them of her origins.

'Yes, I was Jewish. I could no longer deny,' she said, reported De Standaard.

Belgium had opted for neutrality during World War II and remained that way until 1940.

Germany's plan to attack France, and British troops in France, would have forced it through the heavily-fortified Maginot Line along the French-German border.

Instead the Nazis opted to attack via Low countries - the collective name for Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg - in an operation they codenamed Fall Gelb.

They invaded on May 10, 1940 and in a short but bloody series of battles the trio of countries were conquered within 17 days.

Luxembourg fell first, with the Netherlands surrendering on May 14 after the devastating German bombing of Rotterdam.

Belgium lasted the longest, finally surrendering to the Germans on May 27.

One of the climactic battles of the war took place on Belgium soil, Battle of the Bulge in Ardennes lasted from December 16, 1944 until January, 28, 1945.

'You're safe here,' was the reply. 'I have broken with the fascism of my brother.'Â 

It was then Ms Nadel discovered the connection her employer had to Degrelle, but she was told she would be safe at the house as they did not share his views.

But the reminders were still present - in the
children's playroom a portrait of Degrelle was hung on the wall and 
the trio hid in the basement when anyone they felt threatened by 
turned up at the house.

According to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Ms Nadel's mother even occasionally cooked gefilte fish for the family's guests which included Belgian fascists.

She advertised them to her guests as 'oriental fish,' so they would not know she had hired a Jewish cook.

Degrelle was most famous for founding Rex, a Belgian fascist political movement with a close relationship to German's Nazi party and Italian fascists.

He joined the Wehrmacht and later the Waffen SS.

After the war he fled to Spain and became active in Neo-Nazi publications.

He would frequently appear wearing a white uniform featuring his German decorations, and spoke of his 'thinking bond' with Hitler.

Asked if he had any regrets about the war, his reply was: "Only that we lost!

Degrelle died of old age in 1994, escaping the death sentences that his Nazi associates received back home.
