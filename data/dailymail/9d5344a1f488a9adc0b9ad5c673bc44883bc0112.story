Devin Aryal was shot dead by a gunman who was firing at random into passing cars outside of the Twin Cities last night

A 9-year-old boy being picked up by his mother from daycare was shot and killed, apparently at random, by a crazed man with a semiautomatic pistol.

Devin Aryal, who was in the fourth grade, was shot by 34-year-old Nhan Lap Tran as he fired at random at passing vehicles outside of the Twin Cities, police said.

His mother, Melissa Aryal, was also wounded in the shooting, and held her dying son in her arms as he breathed his last.

‘It all happened really fast,’ she told the Pioneer Press, saying that she pulled over when she saw she was bleeding. She saw Devin slumped over in his seat.

‘Just hearing his breath, I had hope,’ the grieving mother told the paper.

The mother and son were rushed to Regions Hospital in St. Paul, where Devin was declared dead. Doctors said he had been shot in the brain.

According to the police, Tran, 34, of Oakdale, shot at random while standing alongside a road starting at around 6:10pm last night.

Police Chief Bill Sullivan said at a news conference Tuesday that there was no known motivation to Tran’s alleged shooting spree. ‘He was shooting the vehicles randomly.’

Devin’s classmates are said to be in shock, and a vigil is being planning for 7pm Tuesday night at Holy Cross Lutheran Church.

Several bursts of gunfire erupted about 6:10 pm on Monday night, apparently at random, in an intersection near the local supermarket, KMSP-TV reported.

The gunman fired at a car carrying the nine-year-old boy and the child's mother, hitting them both and busting their tyres, Oakdale Police Chief Bill Sullivan said.

The woman drove to the nearby Rainbow Foods supermarket where witnesses say she screamed for help.

The child died and the mother was wounded in the arm, and taken to a nearby hospital.

A second female driver was also struck and wounded in the hand, both are expected to recover, Police Chief Sullivan said.

‘It's sick,’ Oakdale Mayor Carmen Sarrack told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune on Monday night.

‘What can you say when a 9-year-old or 10-year-old is killed? People are devastated that this could happen in our city.’

News of the tragedy comes as President Obama is preparing his State of the Union address, where stricter gun control is set to be one of the key points.

Several victims of gun violence will be present at the speech, having been invited by the First Lady Michelle Obama, including the mother of a 15-year-old girl who was killed a mile from the Obama’s Chicago home.

Hadiya Pendleton was killed by a stray bullet in a Chicago park, a mere week after performing at President Obama’s inauguration.

Gun control has been one of the top motions on the president’s agenda since the shooting of 20 children and six teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December.

Mr Obama has already pledged to ban the sale of assault weapons, introduce tougher background checks and reduce the capacity of magazines.
