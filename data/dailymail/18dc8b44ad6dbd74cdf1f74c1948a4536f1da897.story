Dangerous tan: Jerri Turko had the cancerous mole on her leg removed but the disease has spread to her lymph nodes

The best friend of The Only Way Is Essex sisters Sam and Billie Faiers is suffering from skin cancer after using sun beds three times a week.

Jerri Turko started using sunbeds when she was 15 and would even increase their potency by applying tan booster creams.

The 21-year-old hairdresser, who was diagnosed with melanoma in June, has had the cancerous mole from her leg removed, but the disease had already spread to her lymph nodes.

Jerri now faces another operation 
next month to remove the infected lymph nodes in her groin before having to take a 
course of anti-cancer drugs.

In an interview with Closer magazine, Jerri said: ‘Tanning is a way of life for girls in Essex – but now I feel so stupid for risking my life.

‘When doctors told me I had cancer, I burst into tears – what a price to pay for vanity.’

She was diagnosed this summer after returning from a holiday with the Faiers sisters in Marbella.

Jerri became friends with Billie and Sam, who are now stars of TOWIE, when she was 14.

She reveals how she was desperate to tan using sunbeds, despite also going on four holidays a year to sun-drenched locations.

Jerri says that at the age of 15 she would pretend to be 16 to gain access to sunbeds in salons and was soon going twice a week for 10-minute sessions.

By the time she was 18, she was going to the salon three times a week for 14-minute sessions and admits she was addicted.

She tells the magazine: 'Being brown made me feel slimmer. I’d 
go to parties after a sunbed session and I’d still be red and tingling, 
but I didn’t care.'

But when Jerri was 19, in 2009, she noticed that a freckle on her leg had grown substantially and decided to consult her GP.

The doctor told her she was too young to get cancer and reassured her not to worry.

Two years later the growth had become bigger and darker in colour and transformed into a mole, causing her family to become concerned.

But Jerri procrastinated in getting it removed because she ‘didn’t want a scar’.

She continued using sunbeds regularly 
and went to Marbella this May with the cast of TOWIE to top up her tan 
further, despite the mole becoming agitated and itchy.

After celebrating her 21st birthday in June, her family convinced her to go back to the GP, which was when she was diagnosed with cancer.

Surgeons cut out the mole in September and administered a skin graft to cover the 4cm scar, but the cancer had already spread to lymph nodes in her groin.

She can now no longer expose her skin to the sun and has been told to always wear SPF30 and never use a sunbed again.

Jerri revealed that both Sam and Billie have stopped using sunbeds too since her diagnosis.
