A young woman's near death experience was luckily overturned when a tour guide rescued her from croc-infested waters on Friday the 13th.

The woman, only known as Fiona, was driving across Northern Territory's Alligator Rivers Region when her ute became stuck in one of Australia's dangerous crossings.

This follows the recent death of a 62-year-old man who was eaten alive by a crocodile in the same waters just over a week ago.

A woman was on her way to work and driving across Australia's Alligator Rivers Region, in the Northern Territory, when her car became stuck in the middle of a rushing river on Friday

The woman, only known as Fiona, was luckily rescued by Neville who was leading a boat tour

Witness Ren Theelan was at the water's edge of East Alligator River at Kakadu National Park when he watched the incident unfold.

He told Nine News that it appeared the tyres of the vehicle had spun out which caused it to become stranded in the middle of Cahill's Crossing.

He said there was nothing he could do to help the woman, who was on her way to work, as the tide was running too fast.

'She was panicking a fair bit, tooting her horn and crying out for help,' he said.

A tour guide - believed to be named Neville - rescued her to safety whilst on board a Guluyambi Cultural Cruise vessel, reported NT News.

Footage showed Fiona climbing out of the window of car as Neville helped her onto the boat. Other tourists on board quickly came to her aid.

Earlier this month 62-year-old Bill Scott was killed by a crocodile in the same region, about 80 kilometres away.

Mr Scott was on board a boat outside crocodile-management zones patrolled by rangers when the unusual attack happened, sources said.

Grandfather-of-four Bill Scott, 62, was snatched by a 4.7m long saltwater crocodile earlier this month

A statement was released by his family which confirmed that the grandfather-of-four was 'standing at the rear of his moored boat' when he was attacked and dragged into the water by a 4.7 metre long saltwater crocodile in the mid-afternoon on June 7.

Mr Scott's remains were found inside one of two crocodiles shot dead by officers in South Alligator River on the following day in the Arnhem Land region of the Northern Territory.

Authorities were stunned to hear that he had been grabbed by the crocodile while on board a boat - a situation that is usually considered safe.

However, tourists are warned to beware of crocodiles in any part of Kakadu as an attack is always possible.

Kakadu National Park is World Heritage-listed and is where the original Crocodile Dundee movie was shot.
