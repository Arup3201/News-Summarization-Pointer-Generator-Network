Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates has strongly criticized President Obama's passion for the nation's military - contrasting his attitude strongly with that of his predecessor President George W. Bush.

In his forthcoming memoir 'Duty', Gates claims that he never once saw Obama become emotional during a Medal Of Honor ceremony - claiming that his coldness was in stark contrast with Bush, who would regularly 'well up'.

Declaring himself to be 'disturbed' by this 'absence of passion', Gates goes onto say that the only time he saw his commander-in-chief become animated during his time in the administration was during Obama's push to repeal 'don't ask, don't tell.'

Cold: Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates says that he found President Obama cold and passionless at Medal of Honor ceremony's Robert Gates claimed that he regularly saw President George W. Bush well up and become emotional at similar ceremonies

'One quality I missed in Obama was passion, especially when it came to the two wars,' Gates wrote.

'In my presence, Bush -- very unlike his father -- was pretty unsentimental. But he was passionate about the war in Iraq; on occasion, at a Medal of Honor ceremony or the like, I would see his eyes well up.

'I worked for Obama longer than Bush, and I never saw his eyes well up.'

In his opinion, Obama was most concerned with getting rid of the United States' military policy barring openly gay soldiers from serving - and with his Affordable Care Act.

Gates wrote that 'the only military matter, apart from leaks, about which I ever sensed deep passion on his part was 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell.'

'For him, changing the law seemed to be the inevitable next step in the civil rights movement. He presumably was also passionate about health care reform, but I wasn't present for those discussions.'

Responding to the criticism from Gates' book, former White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs vigorously defended the president and said that, 'I think one of the things you take away, at least from the excerpts of this book, is that Bob Gates doesn't like any questions about Bob Gates,' Gibbs said on NBC's Meet the Press.

John McCain called former Defense Secretary Robert Gates 'obviously very frustrated' and criticized the release of Gates' new book as part of a series of remarks on foreign policy on Sunday.

He also suggested retired general David Petraeus return to Iraq to deal with growing violence there.

McCain (R-AZ) made the remarks as part of an interview with Candy Crowley on CNN's 'State of the Union' on Sunday.

McCain said that if he were Gates, he would have waited to release the book, 'Duty: Memoirs of Secretary at War,' which is said to include sharp criticism of President Obama's handling of the war in Afghanistan.

'I think, frankly, I might've -- if I had given him advice -- I would've waited,' McCain said. 'As far as waiting until it's over in Afghanistan, I wouldn't have done that. But maybe [in] retrospect, a little longer than now.'

'He's obviously very frustrated and felt -- which by the way surprised all of us who know him -- and he's decided to really kind of let loose.'

McCain however, described Gates as 'one of the finest public servants I have known.'

The senator also seemed to praise the skills of Petraeus and former ambassador Ryan Crocker.

'I would suggest perhaps sending David Petraeus and Ambassador [Ryan] Crocker back over [to Iraq],' McCain said to CNN anchor Candy Crowley. '(Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri) Al-Maliki trusts them.'

Petraeus also served as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency until his 2012 resignation, after news of his affair with biographer Paula Broadwell became public. 

Crocker served as the US ambassador to Iraq from 2007 to 2009, as well as ambassador to Afghanistan from 2009 to 2012. He retired in 2012 due to unknown health reasons, NPR reported at the time.

McCain also said he believed Iraq 'is not a lost cause' and that the United States may be able to offer logistical support. 

McCain also said he would 'suggest' retired general David Petraeus return to Iraq
