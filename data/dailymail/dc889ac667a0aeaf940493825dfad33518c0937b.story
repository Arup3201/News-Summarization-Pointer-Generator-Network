Hundreds of Google interns have flooded a San Francisco Bay Area apartment complex and the full-time residents say their partying and late hours have gotten out of control.

The much sought after internships afford the lucky college students salaries of upwards of $6,000 per month and, apparently, also afford the free time needed to throw a raucous party.

Meanwhile, the children and families who already called Crescent Village apartments in North San Jose home are wishing these twenty-somethings would go back to where they came from.

Surprise! Last month, at least 400 Google interns were moved into North San Jose, California's posh Crescent Village apartments, much tot he chagrin of full-time residents

Party time: Residents say the interns like these, who are paid a whopping $6,000 per month over the summer, began partying in communal areas like the pool and courtyards of the 1,750-unit complex almost immediately

Until this year, reports New York Magazine, Google did something more typical for its fresh-faced interns: the company offered them a living stipend and told them to find a place of their own. But not this year.

This year, the tech giant put its summer interns up in the high-end complex of some 1,700 apartments, which rent for upwards of $3,375 per month.

There are swimming pools, tennis courts, a fitness center, basketball court, and even a wine room and full-time activities director.

A Facebook page called Crescent Village Google Interns has nearly 400 members. Though the page was up early Monday, as of around noon it had been taken down or suspended.

The intern pictures represented here were found through the group page before it was taken down but are not necessarily the students to blame for Crescent Village complaints.

A Yelp review calling it a ‘pretty bad’ situation said parties happen all week long and that security at Crescent Village has been powerless to stop it.

Pricey: Aside from the lucky interns, Crescent Village houses families and commuting Silicon Valley professionals in apartments that run as much as $3,375 per month. The interns stay for free.

All inclusive: The interns also dine, travel, and participate in group leisure activities for free

Last month, a list of rules and reminders were distributed throughout the complex.

Among them was a request to ‘honor the “quiet enjoyment” of your neighbors.’

Another reminded tenants of the pool hours of 10 to 8.

What’s worse, the residents weren’t told all those students were coming.

‘At first I thought it was summer camp,’ resident Rochelle Fisher, 46, told NY Mag. ‘But then I noticed that the kids were too old.’

Photos like these dot the Facebook accounts of the prestigious interns, many of them grouped on an official Crescent Village Google Interns page

Fisher said the interns don’t bother her as much because she’s on the top floor, but that neighbors have complained about crazy behavior from the temporary residents.

And outside her apartment, Fisher said the interns have, at times, been a nuisance.

‘They dart out into the middle of the street,’ Fisher said. ‘They jaywalk all the time. I have to be very careful when I'm driving.’

The internship also reportedly includes free transportation, food, and other unbelievable amenities. It’s almost as if the recent Owen Wilson/Vince Vaughn comedy comes to life when the students arrive at Mountain View.

To blame? One neighbor in the North San Jose complex took to Yelp, 'the situation is pretty bad' and said the loud partying occurs throughout the week in communal areas such as the one pictured

Yes or no? A comedy about just how posh the Google intern positions are was coincidentally released last month and stars Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn

In fact, The Internship is about two men who land the dream position at Google.

One less lucky intern, who is working at Yahoo! for the summer, has nonetheless been lucky enough to befriend a Google intern.

‘It's pretty fun,’ he said of Crescent Village, calling the parties held four or five times a week ‘sort of normal college parties.

'One temporary issue': One Yelp reviewer of Crescent Village (pictured) bemoaned the annoying summer-long stay of the highly-paid students, but admitted it was, at least, temporary

‘You put a bunch of 20-year-olds in the same place, and what do you expect,’ he said.

Thankfully for the annoyed residents, they expect the invasion to end rather soon.

‘It's like a dorm now,’ wrote another Yelp user who rated the complex highly and called the interns a ‘temporary issue.’

‘I could hear a lot of noise, people talking and singing even in the middle of the night. The sound-proof is pretty good if I close the windows, but it's summer time, I want some fresh and cool air.’

Shutdown: After reports emerged Monday of the interns' behavior, someone quickly suspended a Facebook page dedicated to Crescent Village Google Interns (screen shot pictured here)
