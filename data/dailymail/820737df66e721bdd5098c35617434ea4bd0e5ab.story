Apple is preparing to offer instore hardware repairs for its latest iPhone handsets, according to rumours.

Staff at Apple stores are set to be able to replace several parts of the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C handsets on site, including the handsets' touchscreens.

If a broken phone is under an AppleCare warranty, the repair will be free of charge and owners of the phone could be able to wait in store while their handset is fixed, under the new plans.

Sources told 9to5Mac that special machinery will be installed in Apple stores which will enable staff to be able to fix touchscreens and other defects on site.

The machines are said to be designed to calibrate iPhone displays and are rumoured to have begun arriving in some stores along with replacement parts and training manuals for staff, indicating instore repairs could be offered in the near-future.

Currently Apple replaces damaged and problematic smartphones that are under warranty with completely new handsets, but the new initiative could let customers get repairs while they wait.

While customers with smartphones under warranty are set to get free replacement parts if damage is caused by manufacturing defects, owners whose handsets are not covered will be able to pay $149 for a new screen, if the rumours prove true.

Currently there is no news of how much a UK service might cost, but the price is significantly cheaper than buying the least expensive handset as a replacement phone, as a new 16GB iPhone 5C costs Â£469.

The website's sources also said Apple staff will be able to replace broken volume buttons, cameras, speaker systems and vibrating motors on the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C handsets.

However, while staff will be able to replace the home button on the colourful iPhone 5C models, they will not be able to swap the complex Touch-ID home button on the more luxurious iPhone 5S headsets.

Replacement parts are said to vary in price, but a battery for the handsets is set to cost $79, while a new home button for the iPhone 5C, is rumoured to be $29.

Apple began offering screen replacements for iPhone 5 handsets instore earlier this year, which typically take between 30 minutes and an hour.

If the rumours prove true, instore 
repairs could a win-win for customers and Apple, as customers could save 
time and money, while Apple will not have to replace so many iPhones.
