The Faroe Islands enjoyed their finest night in their international history while Greek football fell to its knees on Friday.

A 1-0 win in Athens is comfortably their greatest victory on the world stage, but the success in European Championship qualifying group F piles on the misery for the home nation.

Already down and under fire after losing at home to Northern Ireland, Joan Edmundsson's 61st-minute goal could not have arrived at a more inopportune time.

Coach Claudio Ranieri will do well to survive such a ghastly result, while deep problems in the domestic league will add to the gloom with the Hellenic Federation on Friday suspending all professional football after an alleged off-the-field attack on a referee.

While a Greek inquest will now kick-off, the Faroes can celebrate a truly memorable win.

This was just their 20th win since joining the international stage in 1988 and their first competitive one since 2011. Their last competitive away win came in 2001 against Luxembourg.

Victories have come against the likes of San Marino and Gibraltar, though, and never against an established, top-level nation.

While Greece may be falling, they were European champions 10 years ago and this win - brought about by former Newcastle United academy player Edmundsson - is a seismic one.

It was clear something unusual was in the offing as Greece laboured in the first half, where other sides would usually be scoring goals.

They did not help themselves with a tepid opening, but even when they got about their opponents, they struggled to make hay.

Panagiotis Kone had their first chance, heading wide from a corner, and then Andreas Samaris drove over from inside the box.

Giannis Maniatis forced a first save of the game out of Gunnar Neilsen, but from distance, while Nikolas Karelis and Lazaros Christodoulopoulos were both off target.

Greek impotency invited the Faroes on and two minutes before the break they went closer than anyone as Frodi Benjaminsen had a header clawed away by Orestis Karnezis.

Their surprising pressure continued and Greece were happy to get in level at the break as Edmundsson also forced a fine save out of the home keeper.

Buoyed by their chances, the Faroes started the second half impressively.

Benjaminsen took aim from just inside the area and was set to celebrate until the ball hit the post.

Greece continued to be slack and Edmundsson made Karnezis work again, and eventually the pressure told.

On the hour Edmundsson connected with a ball from 12 yards out and the deadlock was broken.

Greece knew they were facing a real embarrassment and Kone set about trying to make amends, but hit over when well set.

Kone thudded the bar too, but the Faroes had earned their luck and their moment.

Temur Ketsbaia's reign as Georgia coach looked to have ended after Group B leaders Poland romped to a 4-0 victory in their Euro 2016 qualifier in Tbilisi.

Ketsbaia - who had spells in England with Newcastle and Wolves as well as playing for Scottish club Dundee - declared he would resign no matter what the final outcome at the Dinamo Arena, after just one win in their opening matches left Georgia with little hope of qualification.

Poland, though, remain very much on course for booking a place for the finals in France, having defeated World Cup winners Germany in their last outing.

The visitors made the breakthrough at the start of the second half, when Kamil Glik headed in from a corner, before two goals in as many minutes from Grzegorz Krychowiak and Sebastian Mila ended any hopes of a comeback.

Arkadiusz Milik added a fourth in stopage time, which appeared to back up the post-match claim of Ketsbaia, appointed to the job in November 2009, that 'Georgian football is dead'.

After soaking up some pressure from the hosts, Poland were denied by the woodwork twice in quick succession.

First, on 17 minutes, Miliks shot from the edge of the penalty area came back off the post, with the follow-up from Kamil Grosicki also hitting the upright - much to the relief of Georgia goalkeeper Giorgi Loria. 

Georgia fashioned a good opening on 26 minutes when a clever backheel by Levan Mchedlidze after a thrown-in helped set up Alexander Kobakhidze for a sight of goal from just inside the box, but the Volyn midfielder blazed over.

Poland coninued their dominance in the second half.

Robert Lewandowski acrobative effort was tipped away by Loria, before the visitors took the lead on 51 minutes.

A corner from the left was nodded back by Grzegorz Krychowiak and Glik headed it past Georgia midfielder Jaba Kankava on the line, who was afterwards booked for an attempted handball.

Lewandowski drilled the ball over, before Georgia started to get a foothold back into the match as Kankava dragged a 22-yard effort just wide past diving Poland goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny.

Poland, though, doubled their lead with 20 minutes left.

A deep free-kick from Maciej Rybus was flicked on by Glik towards the far post, where Krychowiak arrived to squeeze the ball past Loria.

It was soon 3-0 when Slask midfielder Mila curled in a superb 25-yard effort after a sublime touch from Lewandowski had killed the ball out on the right touchline.

Poland were denied by the woodwork once again on 83 minutes when Solomon Kvirkvelia's header bounced back off Poland forward Milik and struck the crossbar.

The Ajax forward, though, got on the scoresheet in stoppage time, when he swept the ball home after Lewandowski's angled shot was blocked

Denmark recovered from a goal down to beat Serbia 3-1 away thanks to Nicklas Bendtner's double and a goal from defender Simon Kjaer in their Euro 2016 Group I qualifier in an empty stadium on Friday.

Bendtner equalised on the hour and struck again in the 85th minute, with Kjaer having put them in front in the 62nd, after Zoran Tosic gave the hosts the lead four minutes into the match.

The game was played behind closed doors after Serbia got a two-game crowd ban for fan violence in their last home qualifier against Albania, which was abandoned after a drone stunt triggered a player brawl and a pitch invasion by Serbian fans.

The result left Denmark top on seven points from four games while Serbia, who were awarded a 3-0 walkover win over the Albanians but were also docked three points and have appealed the latter part of the verdict, have one point from two games.

The defeat has piled the pressure on Serbia's Dutch coach Dick Advocaat, who said he was considering quitting.
