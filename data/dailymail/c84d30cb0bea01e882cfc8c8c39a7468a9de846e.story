Over 1,200 miles from Angola, its nearest landmass, St Helena is one of the world's most remote islands.

Currently, the only way to get to the South Atlantic British Overseas Territory is a five-night voyage aboard the RMS  St Helena, a 155-berth passenger ship and cargo carrier, and one of the last ocean-going vessels still to carry the title.

But all this will change next February, when an airport is scheduled to open, and flights will commence from South Africa and the UK.

A travel company is offering tourists the chance to set sail on the St Helena before she is retired, and visitors to the island will arrive by air

So a travel company is offering those with an adventurous spirit - and sturdy sea legs -  the chance to set sail on the St Helena before she is retired.

The return sailing from Cape Town, a journey of 1,200 miles, takes five nights each way, with the voyage being as much a part of the St Helena experience as exploration of the island. As it is likely that some St Helenians will be on board, tourists will have the chance to learn about the fascinating atoll before arriving.

St Helena - which is just ten miles long - is home to remote and unspoilt wilderness and enjoys mild temperatures between 20-27°C.

Britain's second oldest remaining of the British Overseas Territories, after Bermuda, it has a population of just 4,255.

Discovered in 1502, the island was stopover for ships sailing to Europe from Asia and South Africa, and Napoleon was imprisoned there by the British. Longwood House was Napoleon's home during the last years of his life and is now a museum.   

The 20-day tour offered by Discover the World also includes a unique hosted farm stay in a former East India Company plantation owner's home and offers plenty of opportunity to enjoy the island's scenery and historic sites by car. Also included is a 4WD guided tour of the island's less accessible areas and a wildlife cruise. 

Managing Director, Clive Stacey, said: 'There are so few places left on the planet that enjoy the veneers of modern civilization but yet are so unaffected by the stresses these can produce.'

'Although this is fascinating to observe it is not in itself a reason to undertake the long sea journey but combine this with the spectacular vistas and unique and friendly society, soon to be thrust into the modern world with the airport opening, then a trip to St Helena should be at the top of any bucket list,' added Stacey.
