Block: Peers will mount a last-ditch attempt to stop same-sex marriage from becoming law

Peers will mount a last-ditch attempt to stop same-sex marriage from becoming enshrined in law when the controversial legislation comes before the Lords in a week.

Dozens of members of the House of Lords – including leading Conservatives – will defy the Coalition’s attempts to legalise gay marriage.

Baroness Warsi, Minister for Faith and Communities, has refused to steer the legislation through the House of Lords.

As the most powerful Muslim in government, Baroness Warsi has made her concerns over the Marriage (Same Sex Couples)  Bill clear.

Other critics expected to speak out 
against it in the Lords next Monday, include Michael Ancram – the former
Tory chairman, officially known as Lord Lothian – and Lord Dannatt, the
former head of the Army.

The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most
Rev Justin Welby, is also expected to contribute to the debate, as will
his predecessor, Lord Carey.

Lord Dear, a crossbench peer and former 
West Midlands chief constable insisted that critics of the Bill were not
‘anti-homosexual’ but feared the legislation was being rushed through.

He warned 8,000 amendments would have to be made to existing legislation thanks to the policy.

Lord Luce, a former Foreign Office 
minister, said yesterday: ‘This is all part of the Prime Minister’s 
“modernisation” of our party, whatever that word is supposed to mean.’

Some 75 peers have already asked to speak in the debate, meaning it could go on into Tuesday.

The
Government is still expected to ultimately get the legislation through,
but Tory backbenchers have urged the House of Lords to try to scupper 
the legislation, pointing out it was not in the Conservative manifesto 
or Coalition agreement.

Some 133 Tory MPs defied David Cameron to vote against the measure.
