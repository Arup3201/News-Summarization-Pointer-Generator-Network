When new mother Lou Burns arrived at Claridge’s for afternoon tea, she knew the waiters would be on hand to make sure she had everything she could wish for.

What she didn’t want, however, was this giant napkin to cover her up as she breastfed her 12-week-old daughter Isadora.

Staff at the five-star hotel in Mayfair told Mrs Burns, 35, to use the napkin to avoid ‘causing offence’ to other guests. And although she is smiling in this picture she posted on Twitter, the mother of three said she felt humiliated and burst into tears afterwards.

Outrage: Prestigious hotel Claridge's has been criticised after staff ordered Ms Burns, 35, to cover herself up

‘I was really shocked as I had never experienced this before,’ she told the Mail. ‘Through my tears I tried to explain that I was really quite cross.

‘I’m not on some crusade. I just think people shouldn’t be treated like that. It would be nice to have an apology and for them to change their policy to not make any other breast-feeding women feel like second-class citizens.

'Breastfeeding is natural and we’re told it’s best for the baby. It’s a bit silly to say that people would be offended by it.’

Mrs Burns, who is married to comedy actor Nick Burns, took her mother, sister and daughter Isadora to Claridge’s art deco Foyer for afternoon tea on Monday.

She said: ‘It was an annual treat that we have at Christmas time. We’ve been there before and we’ve loved it. My mother had travelled all the way down from Birmingham.

‘We sat down and I started to feed her very discreetly, but within moments of us sitting down, the waiter came over. 

Embarrassed: Mrs Burns, who was dining with her mother, sister and 12-week old daughter Isadora, said she was left so embarrassed by the incident that she would never return to the five star hotel

‘He had this big napkin in his hand and he said he was sorry but it was company policy for feeding mothers to cover themselves, and could I cover myself with this.’

Seeing that she was visibly upset by their actions, they called their manager – who again confirmed the policy.

Mrs Burns said the baby was not comfortable with the napkin over its head and was not able to feed properly.

Finally the management said she could continue without it as long as there were no complaints from anyone else.

She said the hotel knocked some money off the bill and apologised for upsetting her.

But she added: ‘I just told them I was so offended, and so humiliated. I’ve been here quite a few times and I thought it was somewhere you could sit down and breast feed and not be bothered.

‘You couldn’t see anything while I was feeding, because I had a vest underneath my jumper. No-one complained.

‘Women are under so much pressure to breastfeed and it’s not easy. I’ve had two other children that I’ve struggled to breast feed and I think women should be more supported, especially when they are trying not to draw attention to themselves.

‘I told them I couldn’t see myself coming back.’

Posting pictures of the incident online, she wrote: ‘Asked to cover up with this ridiculous shroud while #breastfeeding so not to cause offence @ClaridgesHotel today.

'So much more obvious with it than without! Such a shame I can never go back.... @ClaridgesHotel #breastfeeding.

‘Staff were incredibly polite as you would hope. Think they felt bad....’

The comments were retweeted by her husband, 37, who appeared in Nathan Barley, The Mighty Boosh and the IT Crowd.

Mrs Burns, who lives in Streatham, south London, and works in finance, has since been inundated with messages of support.

One Twitter user wrote: ‘How can the sight of mother feeding her child do anything else than make people feel good! @ClaridgesHotel apologies needed,’ while Lucy Bunting added: ‘Under the 2010 discrimination act, asking a bf’ing mother to cover up is illegal and disgusting behaviour!!!

‘This is clearly their policy not just a rogue member of staff! Even more unacceptable!”

On its website, the NHS says: ‘You shouldn’t ever be made to feel uncomfortable about breastfeeding in public. In fact, the Equality Act 2010 has made it illegal for anyone to ask a breastfeeding woman to leave a public place such as a cafe, shop or public transport.

A Claridge's spokesman told MailOnline: 'We are saddened to see what is being discussed and we feel we need to clarify that breastfeeding is of course embraced at Claridge’s.

'All we ask is that mothers are discrete towards other guests.' 

The row comes after a cafe owner in Surrey was forced to apologise last month for  putting a sign in its window telling mothers they should breastfeed in the toilets.

Tillings Cafe came under fire after a customer posted a picture of the notice - which informs customers they can use the disabled toilet if they want to breastfeed their babies - on Twitter.

But the family-owned coffee shop in Gomshall, Surrey was forced to remove the sign after the National Childbirth Trust, the UK's largest parenting charity, asked for it to be taken down.

Owner June Radford said the sign had been a 'huge miscommunication'.

She said: 'We have had many happy breastfeeding mums in our cafe in the three years we have been open and we continue to support breastfeeding. 

In October, Facebook was forced to reinstated a picture of a mother breastfeeding her severely premature baby for the first time after it was removed from the site because it ‘breached nudity rules’

Emma Bond, 24, posted the picture of herself with Carene, who was born 12 weeks early, but soon found it had been removed after it had been deemed 'offensive'.

Meanwhile in September, breastfeeding mother Olivia Pozniak claimed she was forced to cover up with a dirty dishcloth while joining friends for breakfast at a Wetherspoon pub in Bexleyheath.

In June 27-year-old Carrie Davies says she was left feeling 'embarrassed and ashamed' after staff at Global Buffet in Cardiff suggested she move while feeding her four-month-old son.

And in May, Channel 4 journalist and film-maker Jenny Kleeman was ordered to stop breastfeeding her child by a security guard in a London café because customers were ‘not allowed’ to breastfeed at the table. 

Mothers who staged a mass breastfeeding protest at a Sports Direct store in Nottingham in support for Wioletta Komar, who claims she was asked to leave the premises for breastfeeding her son 

According to the Equality Act of 2010, it is discriminatory to treat a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding.

However, in September a breastfeeding mother claimed today that she was ordered to cover up with a dirty dishcloth while joining friends for a breakfast.

Olivia Pozniak, a single 25-year-old, was feeding her 11-week-old son Louie at the Furze Wren pub owned by J D Wetherspoon in Bexleyheath, Kent, when she was told to cover up.

Meanwhile in August Natasha Barnett, 29, from Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, was told by a lifeguard at Middleton Pool that she could not breastfeed her five-month-old daughter Olive because it was 'classed as eating and drinking'.

In June, a mother was asked to sit in a corner by a waitress while breastfeeding her son - to keep her away from schoolchildren eating in the same restaurant.

Carrie Davies, 27, was left feeling 'embarrassed and ashamed' after staff at Global Buffet in Cardiff suggested she move while feeding her four-month-old son Trystan.

Ms Davies, who was lunching with a friend, was offered a spot by the restaurant's toilets, which bosses at the restaurant say was more 'convenient' for her in light of a large school party who had started eating there.

It comes after around 70 women descended on Sports Direct in Nottingham city centre in April to show support for 25-year-old Wioletta Komar, who claimed she was kicked out of the premises earlier this year for breastfeeding her three-month-old son.

She claims a member of staff suddenly marched over and told her that breastfeeding mothers were not welcome because of 'company policy'.

The sales assistant then told her that the store had no facilities for her and suggested she should go to McDonald's which had a baby and mother room.
