One-in-a-million: Max Blakely, four, misbehaves because of a condition so rare it is only identified as '2P16.3 microdeletion'

A naughty boy whose extreme tempers see him kick and scream while flailing around on the floor has been diagnosed with a chromosome defect so rare it doesn't have a name.

Doctors have said that Max Blakely, four, acts irrationally and violently against his will because of a one-in-a-million chromosome defect that they identify as '2p16.3 microdeletion'.

It means Max, from Greenock, Inverclyde, can fly into a fit of rage at any second and let out a high-pitched scream - an illness is so uncommon it doesn't even have an official title.

His mother Sandra, 42, said: 'It's horrendous. Max throws these terrible tempers at the flick of a switch.

'He hits, headbutts, kicks, screams, lies on the ground and throws anything he can get his hands on.

'It's embarrassing when we're out in public because people just think he's misbehaved - and I'm an awful parent who can't discipline my child.

'I just want to scream, "He has a condition, it's not anyone's fault."'

Max was diagnosed with the extremely rare disorder which means tiny parts of DNA are missing from one of the chromosomes in his genetic make-up in January.

Doctors say it may be linked to either autism or Asperger's Syndrome.

Mrs Blakely believes Max is one of only a handful of people across the UK to have been diagnosed with the condition.

His diagnosis came as a complete shock to the mother-of-two, who suffered 12 years of heartache and seven miscarriages before having her first child Breanna, who is now nine.

'Horrendous': Mother Sandra, pictured with Max at their home in Greenock, Inverclyde, says dealing with her son's behaviour is a daily struggle

Mrs Blakely said: 'It's a relief to know there's a reason for Max's behaviour, but quite scary as so little is known about it.

'Scientists have only started to detect it in the last couple of years.

'Nobody can tell us anything about how to manage it or what the future holds for Max, because they just don't know.'

Mrs Blakely faces a daily challenge managing Max's tantrums.

She says he is unable to control his temper which flares up because he doesn't understand or gets frustrated with everyday situations.

'He has about three a day - and that's on a good day!' she said.

Unintentional: In one of his tantrums - which can be sparked by any reason - Max will throw himself on the floor and flail around, kicking and headbutting while screaming at random intervals

'Max can kick off for any reason . . . because he doesn't like the colour of the taxi that has turned up to take us somewhere, because we're going to the supermarket, because he doesn't want to walk on anything black or simply because he wakes up in a bad mood.

'And when he does, I have to watch him 
like a hawk. He knows no boundaries when it comes to danger, so can 
easily hurt himself or someone else.

A '2p16.3 microdeletion' is an 
extremely rare genetic condition that has only been possible to detect 
in the past few years due to advances in technology.

Sufferers have tiny parts of their DNA missing from one of the chromosomes in their genetic make-up.

The defect commonly causes irrational and sometimes violent behaviour in those that have it.

Although symptoms can vary, Max displayed some obvious indications in his early development that he had the defect.

The four-year-old was slow to sit up on his own after he was born and took longer than the average child to learn to walk.

He also did not talk until 12 months ago.

Max's mother Sandra also says that Max has misaligned toes - another common symptom.

'I've had bruises from where he's picked up heavy things and thrown them at me, he's lifted a knife before . . . the list is endless.

'He's recently started to hold his breath until he turns blue which is very frightening.'

The former auxiliary nurse first noticed something wasn't right when Max was born, but doctors dismissed her as a paranoid mother.

'Max was physically shaky but the hospital said it was just low sugar levels. Then he was late meeting milestones.

'It took him eight months to sit up on his own, 18 months to walk and he only started talking when he was three.

'His toes are also mis-aligned which is one of the symptoms. I really had to push doctors for tests, but I'm glad I did. At least now we know it's an illness. At one point I thought either he was just out of control or that I was a terrible mum!'

A spokesperson for rare chromosome charity Unique said: 'A 2p16.3 microdeletion is an extremely rare genetic condition.

'Only in the last few years, due to advances in technology, has it been possible to detect and diagnose this disorder.'
