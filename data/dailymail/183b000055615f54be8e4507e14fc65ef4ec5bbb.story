A man who admitted tricking his girlfriend into having a msicarrage by giving her a smoothie laced with abortion pills says he feels like a 'sh*tbag' for his actions.

The 26-year-old from Trondheim in central Norway pleaded guilty to inflicting serious bodily harm and also to terminating a pregnancy without the mother's consent after appearing in court.

The man says he gave his former partner, with whom he already had a child, the drugs after he found out she was pregnant after they had a one-night stand at a mutual friend's party.

The man told Trondheim court, pictured, that he felt like a sh*tbag after giving his ex-girlfriend the smoothie laced with the drugs 

He told the court in Trondheim that after she refused to have an abortion, he gave her pills that were meant to induce a miscarriage after buying them online and telling her they were painkillers.

But when they went for the first scan, and the midwife told them that the baby was healthy, he admitted being devastated.

The man then bought more of the pills online and made a smoothie out of them for the woman, aged 20, who was immediately hit by stomach pains.

She then visited her GP, who confirmed that she had suffered a miscarriage brought about by a high dosage of abortion pills.

The man told the court: 'I had a bad conscience and felt remorse, but thought that it was the only way out.

'I read online that pills could cause deformities if they did not work.

The man had bought the pills online and first gave them to the woman, telling her that they were painkiller (file picture) 

'After the first attempt didn't work, I thought that if it was my fault that the child was born with major malformations, I would not be able to live with that. So I decided to try again.

'I felt like a total sh*tbag when it dawned on me what I had done.'

State prosecutor Kaja Strandford is calling for the man to be sentenced to the maximum of seven years in jail.

She told the Adresseavisen newspaper: 'He imported these substances. All of it was precisely and cynically planned.

The defendant will return to court for sentencing next week.
