Dozens of clinics have come forward to admit that breast implants they gave to women have ruptured – but Health Secretary Andrew Lansley has revealed much of the data filed is incomplete.

He has 
given clinics until Friday to submit full data on the implants and the 
results will be published next week.

But he
told BBC Breakfast today: 'Some of the private providers, as of yesterday, 
had not provided any data at all, many had, some had provided what on 
the face of it looks quite good data, others what appeared to be very 
poor quality.'

There is growing concern about the safety of the cheaply made implants, which used low-grade industrial silicone designed for mattresses

At least 50 clinics have reported 
burst, perished and broken implants made by French firm PIP to the 
medical watchdog since Friday.

The
total number of women whose implants have ruptured is not known, but 
even conservative estimates suggest it could be as high as 1,000.

The Government still insists there is no need to remove them en masse.

Yesterday, consultant plastic surgeon Fazel Fatah, who is sitting on the panel investigating the implant scandal, said there were no firm figures in the UK on what proportion of devices have ruptured.

The president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, who is advising Mr Lansley, added: ‘The point is not so much the rupture rates but that the quality of the silicone in these implants is not of medical grade.

Surgeons can take out most breast implants in around an hour, going in through the original 5cm scar under the breast.

All implants create scar tissue around them once inside - known as the scar capsule - and this can be removed at the same time as the implant.

However, if an implant ruptures, scar tissue can build up to a greater degree, causing hardness, and can be more difficult to remove.

While most women have no symptoms when a silicone breast implant ruptures, the leaking gel can cause pain and result in changes to the contour or shape of the breast.

The gel may cause inflammation and the layers of extra scar tissue.Rupture of a breast implant can be confirmed by mammogram, ultrasound, CT scan or MRI.

Douglas McGeorge, consultant plastic surgeon said if an implant ruptures the 'goo' must also be taken out.

Operations of this type also carry the risks of anaesthetic and a small risk of infection.

'Recovery is also about two weeks - that is you should allow two weeks to get back to day to day activities,' he added.

'Therefore, the implants are not fit to be implanted into humans. They are substandard, they are defective.

'The Government must make sure that 
women who have these implants are not caught in the middle of an 
argument over who's going to pay for their removal.

'I think we have reached a point and 
the level of anxiety is such that there should be clear advice over what
is the right course of action for women to take.'

Nigel Mercer, a former president of 
BAAPS, said: ‘It would be sensible for the Government to say, “Take them
out” and then sort out the funding later.’

Labour said that the public had been 
‘left in the dark’ and called for the £2.3billion private cosmetic 
surgery industry, which carried out 95 per cent of the operations, to 
take responsibility.

Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham 
said: ‘I get a sense that these individuals are very good at the sales 
pitch and making money off people at the start but less good at 
after-care and facing up to responsibilities when things go wrong.’

But the trade body for private medical
clinics, Independent Healthcare Advisory Services, said it would be 
‘irresponsible’ to remove all implants as any surgery carries risks, 
and, in any case, clinics couldn’t afford to foot the bill.

It said that an audit of thousands of cases by its members suggests the true rupture rate lies between  1 per cent and 2 per cent and so is ‘within the industry standard’.

As many as 50,000 women in the UK, including thousands of breast cancer survivors, have the fragile implants, so even a 2 per cent failure rate would take the number of ruptures to 1,000.

At the weekend, figures from private chain Transform suggested the true rupture rate to be 7 per cent.

But a spokesman said the figure was based on seven cases out of just 108 patients – too small a sample for robust statistics.

In France, between 5 per cent and 10 per cent have ruptured and the state is to fund removal from 30,000 women.

Last night, French health minister Xavier Bertrand ordered a full investigation into the ‘truly contaminated’ implants.
