Jordan Henderson is adamant he can handle the pressure of being Liverpool’s second-in-command thanks to the baptism of fire he received on Merseyside.

The England midfielder has made giant strides since he turned down a move to Fulham in August 2012 and was rewarded by Brendan Rodgers last Friday, when he was appointed vice-captain in the wake of Daniel Agger’s departure.

Henderson will one day be expected to take over Steven Gerrard’s mantle and ahead of Saturday’s trip to West Ham, the 24-year-old says he could not wish for a better man to be educated by and hailed the skipper’s influence.

The midfielder says he has learnt a huge amount from the club's legendary skipper Steven Gerrard

‘I have learned from players all around me but he has been a massive influence on my career,’ said Henderson. 

‘I try and learn everything that I can from him because he has not only been the best leader for Liverpool and England, he’s probably been the best leader in football in general.

‘I’ve got no better man to learn from. Stevie just said congratulations to me. He told me that I had worked hard and deserved it, it meant a lot coming from him. I think it shows how much I have progressed.’

Henderson joined Liverpool in 2011 from Sunderland but started slowly and nearly left Anfield soon after

The 24-year-old has come on leaps and bounds and is now a regular starter for Roy Hodgson's England team 

Rodgers, meanwhile, has no concerns about Adam Lallana’s form since he returned to the starting line-up and believes the £23million midfielder will show why Liverpool made such a big investment in him this summer when he is fully fit.

Lallana missed six weeks after damaging medial ligaments during a training session in Boston in July but Rodgers said: ‘It was always going to be difficult however way you look at it, coming into a new club. 

‘For the likes of Adam, he missed pre-season.

‘Even without that there is going to be a six-month settling in period. But he’ s settled very well and loves the club. Once he gets his match fitness he’ll be very good.’
