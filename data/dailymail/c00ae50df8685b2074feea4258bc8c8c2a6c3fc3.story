Interim chief executive Kim Hodgson received up to £95,000 for two-and-a-half months' work 

A temporary NHS boss was paid more than £1,000 a day when she was parachuted in to help a health trust.

Interim chief executive Kim Hodgson received up to £95,000 for just two-and-a-half months’ work.

This is equivalent to £450,000 a year – or more than three times the Prime Minister’s £142,500 salary.

Temporary finance boss Ian O’Connor was handed as much as £50,000 for 56 days, which works out at more than £358,000 annually.

The fat cat pay packets were paid by Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Colchester General Hospital and Essex County Hospital.

It was put into special measures following a damning report by the Care Quality Commission last November.

Details emerged in the trust’s annual report, which showed wages for senior staff took up 12.7 per cent of the wage bill between April 2013 and the end of March this year, helping to push it £2.4 million into the red.

Colchester MP Sir Bob Russell said no hospital chief executive should be paid more than the Prime Minister.

‘It calls into question the whole stewardship of the NHS,’ he added.

‘What message does that send out to the hard-working medical and support staff who have been let down by the management and are then being told someone who has come in to a managerial role has been paid that huge sum of money?’

Karen Webb, of the Royal College of Nursing, added: ‘Colchester has been through a very difficult, challenging period and there is a need for experienced executive directors to help guide a trust through that process.

‘But that said, hard-working and dedicated nurses will be appalled at the scale of the pay that interim executives receive.

‘It won’t be lost on nursing staff that it comes at a time when the Government has refused to pay nurses the one per cent pay rise.’

The average NHS nurse is paid £23,038 per year.

Former trust governor Des McCarron warned ‘having all these interim people’ was not good for the organisation.

The large pay packets came after Dr Gordon Coutts, right, stepped down as chief executive the day before a damning Care Quality Commission report was published about the Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust

Miss Hodgson replaced Dr Gordon Coutts, who resigned as chief executive the day before the CQC report was published. It revealed cancer staff had been bullied into falsifying patient data.

The trust’s financial report showed he had received up to £145,000 for the nine months to December 31.

Miss Hodgson’s pay scale meant she received between £90,000 and £95,000 from January 13 to March 31.

She remained in her role until May when she was replaced by Dr Lucy Moore – suggesting she received around £180,000 for the four-month period.

Mr O’Connor - who earned between £50,000 and £55,000 from February 3 to March 31 - held his post until July, when he moved to a similar position at Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust.

The huge remuneration packages will fuel the debate over public sector pay. Thousands of senior staff, including headteachers, council bosses, quangocrats and civil servants, are paid more than the Prime Minister.

Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust said using interim staff saved on benefits permanent staff are entitled to, such as pension contributions and paid holiday leave.

It added: ‘These individuals were available at relatively short notice and each was highly qualified with the appropriate skills and experience for these posts, which are extremely demanding and challenging.’

A report published in November 2013 by healthcare watchdog the Care Quality Commission suggested officials falsified data to make it look as if crucial cancer treatment targets were met. 

The CQC said the records of 22 cancer patients had been changed to cover up the fact they had faced ‘extensive’ delays for treatment – which could have put their lives at risk.

It found that at least three of the patients waited more than 100 days for treatment, including one who waited 126 days.

Government guidelines state patients should wait no longer than 31 days for surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy after their doctor has decided on the best course of treatment.

When hospitals are unable to treat patients within the target timeframe they have a duty to investigate and offer alternative hospitals. 

The investigation also found that staff had been ‘pressured, bullied and harassed’ to change figures on cancer waiting times to meet government targets. 

The CQC spoke to three staff members who were asked by bosses to change waiting times figures.

After the report was published, NHS England launched a probe involving the files of as many as 25,000 cancer sufferers who had undergone treatment at the hospital in the past three years.

Essex Police also confirmed a criminal investigation would begin into the alleged manipulation of cancer waiting lists. 

One patient, four-year-old Mackenzie Cackett, died of a brain tumour after a series of appalling delays to his treatment at Colchester General Hospital.

Two months before Mackenzie died, a touching picture was taken of him with the Duchess of Cambridge, who visited him in a nearby hospice. 

Although Mackenzie is not one of the patients identified in the report, the hospital launched a separate investigation into his death over concerns ‘administrative errors’ led to delays in diagnosis and treatment.

In December last year, it emerged that Dr Gordon Coutts, who was on sick leave, would not return to the trust by ‘mutual agreement’. A trust spokesman said Dr Coutts, who served as chief executive for three years, would not get any payoff and would not be receiving further salary payments.

Every year, around 6,000 people are treated by Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust for cancer.
