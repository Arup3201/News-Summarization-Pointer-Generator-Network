Fears are growing for a missing University of Kansas honors studentÂ  who has not been seen for two days, say friends and relatives who are desperate to find him.

Gianfranco Villagomez-Saldan was last seen near Ninth and Michigan streets in Lawrence, Kansas about 2:30 a.m. Saturday, when he left a friend's house to walk less than a half-mile to his girlfriend's apartment.

Villagomez-Saldan never made it.

Missing: Gianfranco Villagomez-Saldana was last seen early Saturday morning walking to his girlfriend's house

'I miss my boyfriend. He is lost, and we all want to find him. He's such
 a wonderful person, and he always took such good care of me. I just 
hate that he's out there somewhere, maybe hurt,' Villagomez-Saldan's girlfriend, Donna Harkrider, told KCTV.

Now, friends and authorities are anxiously searching for any clues regarding his whereabouts.

'We're just looking for anywhere that he might have gone inside to try to get warm, just anywhere like that he might have gone that somebody wouldn't have already noticed,' friend Nick Kraly told the station.

Worried: Villagomez's girlfriend, Donna Harkrider, is worried he's possibly hurt and not getting the help he needs

Villagomez-Saldan's friends say it's unlike him to disappear without telling anyone where he was, noting how responsible the 23-year-old industrial design student typically is

'He is one of the kindest and most responsible people I know, and so for
 him to be gone without telling anyone, especially for this long of a 
time, is absolutely bizarre and it just kind of terrifies me,' Kraly 
said.

Villagomez-Saldan, originally from Lima, Peru, is described as being 5-foot-8, 165 pounds with black hair, brown eyes and glasses. At the time of his disappearance, he was wearing a blue shirt with a KU Jayhawk on it, a long-sleeved gray shirt, a black jacket, jeans and white tennis shoes.#

Search: Friends of Gianfranco Villagomez-Saldana have been handing out fliers and looking for him since he was last seen on Saturday
