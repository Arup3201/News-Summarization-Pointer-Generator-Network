Hartlepool United will not be signing convicted rapist Ched Evans, ‘irrespective of his obvious ability as a football player’.

The League Two club today released a statement  regretting their link with the 25-year-old striker, who was released from prison in October after serving half of a five-year sentence for the rape of a 19-year-old woman in a hotel room in 2011.

However, the club mentioned the appeal in signing a player of Evans’ ability in its statement.

New manager Ronnie Moore said on Saturday that he would like to bring the Wales international to Victoria Park, but the club backed down in light of strong opposition from supporters and the town’s MP.

The statement read: ‘Following media reports relating to the possible signing of Ched Evans the Club wishes to make its position clear.

‘Hartlepool United do not intend signing Ched Evans and, for the avoidance of doubt, will not be doing so, irrespective of his obvious ability as a football player.

‘This story has emerged following an unsubstantiated internet rumour which the manager was asked to comment upon. The manager responded hypothetically to the situation by stating “if it could happen I would want it to happen”.

'This response was based upon the player’s obvious ability as a footballer and as such as then been headlined by the media without asking the club for their official position.

‘The club can fully understand the concerns of supporters and the general public and regrets any misconception portrayed.

‘After a highly positive week at Hartlepool United following the takeover by new owners and the appointment of a new manager, the owners are saddened by this unfortunate turn of events and wish to draw a line under it immediately.’

New chairman Peter Harris, who completed his takeover from Norwegian owners IOR last week, added: ‘We are upset at the manner in which this story has escalated and wish to make it clear that the player will not be joining the club.

‘All we are concentrating on is league survival and do not want anything to upset that goal.

‘The club regrets any upset that may have been caused but we feel we must deal with this matter quickly and put the story to bed once and for all.’
