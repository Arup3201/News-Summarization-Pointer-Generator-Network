As expected, North Carolina voters approved a constitutional amendment on Tuesday defining marriage solely as a union between a man and a woman, making it the 30th state to adopt such a ban.

With several large counties still not reporting, unofficial returns showed the amendment passing nearly 60 per cent to 40 per cent.

Supporters of the bill from around the state held rallies, including Vote for Marriage and Coalition to Protect All N.C. families.

Vote for Marriage lavishly celebrated with a seven-tier wedding cake.

In the final days before the vote, 
members of President Obama's cabinet expressed support for gay 
marriage and former President Bill Clinton recorded phone messages 
urging voters to reject the amendment.

Opponents also held marches, ran TV ads and gave speeches, including one by Jay Bakker, son of televangelists Jim Bakker and the late Tammy Faye Bakker.

Meanwhile, supporters had run their own ad campaigns and church leaders urged Sunday congregations to vote for the amendment.

The Rev. Billy Graham, who at 93 remains influential even though his last crusade was in 2005, was featured in full-page newspaper ads supporting the amendment.

Both sides spent a combined $3million on their campaigns.

Soon after the news got out, prominent personalities took to Twitter to voice their opinions. Meghan McCain wrote a series of tweets encouraging her gay friends to stay strong.

She wrote: ‘I for one absolutely refuse to stop fighting until every American has the same right to love and marriage that I do,’ later adding, ‘God loves us and God doesn’t make mistakes.’

Ellen DeGeneres made her issue with the bill personal. ‘Getting married was one of the greatest things I have ever done,’ she tweeted. ‘I hope everyone in North Carolina gets the same opportunity someday.’

Modern Family actor Jesse Tyler Ferguson wrote: ‘This is an interest fact I just learned: First cousins can marry in North Carolina. (Unless they are of the same sex, I assume.’

First cousins in North Carolina can, in fact, marry, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. However, state law prohibits double-cousin marriage.

North Carolina law already bans gay 
marriage, like nine other states, but an amendment would effectively 
slam the door shut on same-sex marriages. 

The amendment also goes beyond state 
law by voiding other types of domestic unions from carrying legal 
status, which opponents warn could disrupt protection orders for 
unmarried couples.

Six states - all in the Northeast except Iowa - and the District of Columbia allow same sex marriages.

Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York, and the District of Columbia all allow same-sex marriages.

Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, New Jersey, and Rhode Island all allow civil unions, which offer spousal rights to same-sex couples.

California, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington state grant nearly all spousal rights and allow domestic partnerships.

The North Carolina amendment was 
placed on the ballot after Republicans took over control of the state 
Legislature after the 2010 elections, a role the GOP hadn't enjoyed for 
140 years.

Joe Easterling, who described himself as a devout Christian, voted for the amendment at a polling place in Wake Forest.

'I
know that some people may argue that the Bible may not necessarily be 
applicable, or it should not be applicable, on such policy matters. But 
even looking at nature itself, procreation is impossible without a man 
and a woman.

‘And because of those things, I think it is important that the state of North Carolina's laws are compatible with the laws of nature but, more importantly, with the laws of God.'

Linda Toanone, who voted against the amendment, said people are born gay and it is not their choice.'We think everybody should have the same rights as everyone else. If you're gay, lesbian, straight - whatever,' she said.

The way we live now: North Carolina joins the dark blue states that have constitutional provisions that define marriage strictly between a man and a woman

North Carolina is the latest presidential swing state to weigh in on gay marriage. Florida, Virginia and Ohio all have constitutional amendments against gay marriage, and Obama's election-year vagueness on gay marriage has come under fresh scrutiny.

Obama, who supports most gay rights, has stopped short of backing gay marriage.

Marriage between one man and one woman is the only domestic legal union that shall be valid or recognized in this state.

Without clarification, he's said for the past year and a half that his personal views on the matter are 'evolving.'

Education Secretary Arne Duncan broke ranks with the White House on Monday, stating his unequivocal support for same-sex marriage one day after Vice President Joe Biden said he is 'absolutely comfortable' with same-sex married couples getting the same rights at heterosexual married couples.

One fault line that could determine the result is generational. Older voters, who tend to be more reliable voters, are expected to back the amendment.

State House Speaker Thom Tillis, a Republican from a Charlotte suburb, said even if the amendment is passed, it will be reversed as today's young adults age.

'It's a generational issue,' Tillis told a student group at North Carolina State University in March about the amendment he supports. 'If it passes, I think it will be repealed within 20 years.'

The amendment also goes beyond state law by voiding other types of domestic unions from carrying legal status, which opponents warn could disrupt protection orders for unmarried couples.

'Also, that amendment is against women, I believe, because also underneath the amendment, other laws are saying that people who aren't married at all, they can't file for domestic abuse cases, if they're living with their significant other. Which is wrong,' Toanone said.

In North Carolina, more than 500,000 voters had cast their ballot before Tuesday, which was more than the 2008 primary when Obama and Hillary Clinton were fighting for the Democratic presidential nomination. Both sides said that bodes well for them.
