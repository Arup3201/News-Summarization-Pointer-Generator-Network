Forensic experts are excavating a number of graves in a chapel in Madrid in the hopes of finding the resting place of author Miguel de Cervantes.

The Don Quixote-writer was buried at the Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians in Madrid's historic Literary Quarter in 1616, but the exact location of the grave within the chapel is unknown 

A team of archaeologists and anthropologists have now started  decided to start excavations at the site after identifying what they believe are three unrecorded and unidentified graves in the chapel's crypt.

Discovery: Experts analyse bones to find the remains of the 17th Century author Miguel de Cervantes at the Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians in Madrid

Clues: Miguel de Cervantes, considered to be Spains greatest writer and the author of 'Don Quixote' was buried in 1616 at the Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians in Madrid, but the exact whereabouts of his grave within the tiny convent chapel are unknown

The first phase of the excavation, costing some £37,381, is expected to last two weeks

Cervantes is best known for his 1605 novel The Adventures of the Ingenious Nobleman Don Quixote of La Mancha, which changed Spanish literature in the 17th century.

His wife, Catalina Salazar, was also buried at the convent, although the location of her grave also remains a mystery.

The first phase of the excavation, costing some 50,000 euros (£37,381), is expected to last two weeks. 

A team of more 20 forensic experts began examining the graves in the chapel crypt on Saturday, extracting bones and remains from several graves.

Experts paid particular interests to three locations, two niche graves, from where bones were extracted and examined in the crypt, and one grave beneath the terracotta floor.  

Cervantes is best known for his 1605 novel about Don Quixote, which has been translated into more languages than any book - other than the Bible

Excavation: A team of archaeologists and anthropologists take notes after starting the excavation work after identifying three unrecorded and unidentified graves in the chapel's crypt

Analysis: The bones found will be exhumed and analyze, after that, the experts will try to identify the bones using DNA profiling

Close to the crypt's entrance, two scientists studied images obtained from within another wall niche by using an endoscope camera carefully inserted through a tiny hole.

Elsewhere, a team assembled a geo-radar device mounted on wheels to probe other possible underground locations.

'Were we to find remains that fulfill the characteristics we are looking for, we could possibly pass to a next stage. That would be to compare DNA similarities with his sister, but that is a very complex step,' said Francisco Etxeberria, a forensic medicine specialist from the University of the Basque Country.

The author's sister, Luisa de Cervantes, was buried in a convent in Alcala de Henares, 19 miles east of Madrid, where she was interred in 1623.

Almudena Garcia Rubio, who is leading the Cervantes project, said Friday if they don't find Cervantes' remains in the places so far identified, there are four other possible locations at the convent they could try next.

Evidence marking the location of Cervantes' grave is believed to have been lost during an enlargement of the church after his death.

Etxeberria said, back in Cervantes' day, graves were not often marked with long-lasting memorials such as carved headstones.

Before settling down to work, the forensic team had to shift piles of old books and bookcases from the space, which had previously been rented out to a publishing company. 

Don Quixote was the magnum opus of Miguel de Carvantes and was published in two volumes, in 1605 and 1615.

It is considered the most influential work of Spanish literature and is considered one of the greatest works of fiction ever published. 

Carvantes influence on the Spanish language has been so great that the language is often referred to as 'the language of Cervantes'.

The author died in 1616 at the age of 69.

In accordance with his wishes, Cervantes was burried in in the Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians in Madrid's historic Barrio de las Letras, or Literary Quarter.  

His bones went missing in 1673 when work was undertaken at the convent. They were thought to have initially been taken to another convent before being returned.
