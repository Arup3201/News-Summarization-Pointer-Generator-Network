A heroic father-of-two who suffered fractured facial bones after he was brutally beaten for standing up for a bullied 14-year-old boy said he would do it again despite his extensive injuries.

Wen Jones, a 43-year-old former Marine from Jupiter, Florida, was at the beach on May 19 when he saw Zion Wright being picked on by three older men.

When he told them to back down, the trio - Cody Moore Roon, Tyler Dylan Carswell and Eric Michael Deiter, all 20 - allegedly attacked. The men have now been arrested.

Mr Jones suffered concussion and a fracture under his eye which needed surgery and he was left with stitches over his face. Still, he said he'd do the same again.

'I'm not happy to have been injured pretty severely, but at the same time, I ask myself, would I do it again?' he asked the Sun Sentinel. 'You know, it was the right thing to do, so I probably would.'

Police reports note that the three men had been bullying Zion, an amateur competitve skateboarder, and his friends earlier that day.

As well as kicking sand at him, his father, LeRoy Wright Jr., told the Sentinel that they used racial slurs against the boy, who is black. Police have not charged them with a hate crime.

Later the same day, the men continued to harass the teenagers outside the restrooms and when Zion's father arrived and saw them, he told them to leave.

Instead, the men failed to back down and Jones walked past the scene and saw the trio troubling the father and his son.

'I couldn't stand there and watch this older guy and kid get beaten up,' Jones said.

So he approached them and told the men to calm down - but they then turned on him.

'I got tangled up with one the biggest 
guys and he beat me in the back of the head until I was unconscious,' he said. 
'When I came to, I was being beaten in the face.'

As police arrived on the scene, the three men ran away but witnesses helped track them down. Some also recorded the attack on their cell phones and have handed footage over to authorities.

Doing what's right: Even though Jones, right, suffered fractured facial bones and a concussion after standing up for Zion, left, he said he would do it again. Zion's father has thanked Jones for h

Roon, Carswell and Deither are now facing aggravated battery charges.

Wright was taken to hospital and had surgery a few days later. But he did not ask Jones for his name, so the two men have not spoken since.

But Wright told the Sentinel that he hopes they'll be in touch.

'I feel like this man literally risked his life, because he saw a situation that was bad,' Jones said. 'Out of all the people that was standing around on the beach that day, he was the only one that stood up against these guys.'
