The DASH Diet has topped a major annual ranking of the best weight-loss regimes for the fourth year in a row - despite not having been designed for that purpose.

An acronym for Dietary Approaches to 
Stop Hypertension, it advocates fresh produce, whole grains, lean 
protein and is low in fat and salt.

Experts for U.S. News and World Report found the cholesterol-lowering plan to be the best diet overall, as well as best for healthy eating and tied-best for those with diabetes.

Healthy living: The DASH Diet has topped a major annual ranking of the best weight-loss regimes for the fourth year in a row - despite not having been designed for that purpose

It was also given a score of 3.2 (out of 5) for short-term weight-loss and 3.0 for long-term weight-loss.

The downside of the DASH diet, researchers found, was that the recommended fresh ingredients can be 'somewhat pricey'.

An acronym for Dietary Approaches to 
Stop Hypertension, the DASH diet advocates fresh produce, whole grains, lean 
protein and is low in fat and salt.

Developed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, a free guide assesses how many calories you should be eating according to your age and activity levels.

It is the medical community’s most accepted definition of a heart-healthy 
diet because it comprises nutrients like potassium, calcium, protein, and fiber that help fight high blood pressure.

High fat, sugar and salt foods are off-limits, as is alcohol, but it is otherwise considered vry easy to follow, so good for long-term followers.

Experts
 found the plan to be best for healthy eating and tied-best for those with diabetes.

The site's verdict read: 'Though obscure, it beat out a field full of better-known diets.

'A healthy eating pattern is key to deflating high blood pressure - and it may not hurt your waistline, either.'

The TLC diet, also targeting cardiovascular health, came a close second in the best overall diets. An acronym for Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes, it was deemed 'a very solid diet plan created by 
the National Institutes of Health.'

The Mayo Clinic Diet, the Mediterranean Diet and Weight Watchers all took a joint third place.

It came as some surprise to see some very popular diets fall in at the bottom of the list. The Paleo Diet (also known as the Caveman Diet) scored just two out of five because 'replicating a caveman-style diet in modern times would be difficult.'

The Dukan Diet, beloved of Carole Middleton, came joint-last because it is 'too restrictive, with lots of rules, and there’s no evidence it works.' One expert even described it as 'idiotic.'

Among the usual suspects were several new diets, including the Flexitarian Diet, which came in at number six, and the Traditional Asian Diet, which ranked at number 11.

The Spark Solution Diet, the Anti-Inflammatory Diet and the Engine 2 Diet were also newcomers to the ranking, but none managed to make it into the top ten.
