Central St Martins graduate fashion show is considered a pivotal event for wannabe designers to show off their hard work to the fashion press as well as potential employers and buyers in 
the industry.

Ex-students include Stella McCartney, John Galliano and Sarah Burton, so it is safe to say that the pressure is on to impress as the young designers picked to appear in the show are considered the future of fashion.

And this year one young designer has most certainly attracted attention, but for all the wrong reasons.

That's a bit fishy: Central Saint Martins BA fashion show saw budding designer Cassandra Verity Green send her own pet goldfish down the catwalk

Cassanda Verity Green sent a model down the catwalk with accessories containing a real life goldfish.

And while she may have been applauded by the audience for her quirky style, the RSPCA have hit out at the show claiming her bags encourage people to treat living things as 'replaceable ornaments'.

While the runway event is famous for pushing the boundaries of fashion, the animal charity claims that the goldfish-bowl shaped bags, containing the designer's own pet goldfish, is a step too far.

Complaint: The RSPCA have hit out claiming her designs encourage people to treat living things as 'replaceable ornaments'

An RSPCA spokeswoman said: 'While we understand that a graduate fashion show is about grabbing attention and headlines, we do have concerns that using a living creature to create a novel or unusual accessory encourages people to see them as replaceable ornaments, rather than living creatures in need of care and commitment.'

The charity explained that the fishy handbag designs could lead to poor water quality and a lack of oxygen for the orange fish.

Course director Willie Walters told the Evening Standard: 'When Cassandra Verity Green first said that she would like to use her goldfish in the bags the subject was discussed at length to ensure that the fish would be comfortable.'

'They were brought to the show in their usual bowls, and placed into them and fed between catwalk runs', she added.

Other wacky designs seen at the 
prestigious show included bulls horn accessories, furry aprons, walking 
watercolours, shoes made from plastic bottles and a silk parachute worn 
as a dress.

But it was Japanese student Mao Usami who took home Young Designer of the Year for her collection of loungewear basics including oversized teddy bear jumpers.
