Edinburgh Zoo is celebrating the birth of Rica, its first ever armadillo pup.

The three-banded armadillo, a native to Brazil, was born to mum Rio and dad Rodar in August weighing just 0.1lb (81g).

Keepers said the animal has rapidly 'grown in to her shell' and already weighs around 1lb (450g) -having grown more than five times her birthweight to the size of a grapefruit.

New arrival: Edinburgh Zoo is celebrating the birth of Rica, its first ever armadillo pup (pictured). The three-banded armadillo, a native to Brazil, was born to mum Rio and dad Rodar in August weighing just 0.1lb (81g)

Gareth Bennett, senior presentations keeper at Edinburgh Zoo, said the birth was an 'amazing achievement' as Rio and Rodar only arrived from Plock, in Poland, in March.

'This is the first birth of any armadillo species at Edinburgh Zoo, and it is amazing how quickly little Rica is growing up,' he said.

The Brazilian three-banded armadillo has a blackish-brown armour plating, which covers its body, head and tail.

The plating comes in the form of two domed shells which are separated by three armoured bands of flexible of skin, allowing the armadillo to roll up into a ball.

It has a great sense of smell, and uses it to find termites under the soil. The armadillo will thrust its nose into the soil and then use its tongue to reach its prey. 

The species reaches at most 20 inches (50cm) in length and about 3.3lbs (1.5kg).

This has allowed it to survive 140 million years of evolution, but the creature is now listed as 'vulnerable' because it lost nearly 50 per cent of its habitat in the last 15 years.

The species produces one single offspring each year, so populations are slow to recover when hit by loss of habitat.

This has allowed it to survive 140 million years of evolution, but the creature is now listed as 'vulnerable' because it lost nearly 50 per cent of its habitat in the last 15 years.

The Caatinga dry forest, where most of these armadillos live, once covered about 11 per cent of the Brazilian territory, and that has now been reduced to around six per cent.

'[Rica] is just amazing to watch, always full of energy and scurrying about her surroundings like a perfectly formed miniature of a fully grown three banded armadillo,' said Mr Bennett.

'For her first few weeks she could not quite roll up into a perfect ball because of her huge claws and softer, smaller shell, but she has now grown into her shell and can quickly pack herself into the tightly sealed ball which adult three-banded armadillos are known for.

'You would never know that Rio was a first time mother as she is incredibly protective of Rica, constantly watching or carrying her, but mum is also very relaxed and has had no problem getting her new-born to suckle from her.

A star is born: Rica becomes the zoo's fourth three-banded armadillo, along with parents and ten-year-old Dillon. Mr Bennett said the keepers discovered Rio was pregnant after discovering scratch marks on her back, and an ultrasound scan showed up a peanut-sized baby

'Rica remains off show for now but she is doing great and will soon be out meeting the public. They grow up very fast - she will reach maturity within a year.'

Rica becomes the zoo's fourth three-banded armadillo, along with her parents and ten-year-old 'retired star' Dillon.

Mr Bennett said the keepers discovered Rio was pregnant after discovering scratch marks on her back, and an ultrasound scan showed up a peanut-sized baby.

'When she first arrived at Edinburgh Zoo it did not take long for mum Rio to come out of her shell, very quickly becoming one of the stars of the Animal Antics hilltop shows, scurrying about through the feet of the audience,' he said.

'However, after a few months, we noticed a slight change in her body weight and a few scratch marks on her back. Putting two and two together we investigated with an ultrasound and were able to make out a peanut sized little armadillo shape.

'The family all lived together just after the birth, however in the wild all armadillo species are solitary animals.

'We recently had to take dad Rodar away as female armadillos are ready to mate again about two weeks after the birth and another offspring would have been a bit too much for Rio at this stage.'
