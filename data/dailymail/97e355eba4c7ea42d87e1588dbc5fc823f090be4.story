Bayern Munich  defender Dante has complained about the lack of respect shown to him since Brazil were beaten 7-1 by Germany at the World Cup.

The 31-year-old was drafted into the national side for the match to cover for Brazil's suspended captain Thiago Silva.

While he was not singled out at the time for being especially at fault for the result, Dante feels German supporters no longer show him the respect he deserves.

Dante feels his reputation back in Germany has suffered as a result of the humiliating defeat 

'What is happening is unfair,' he told Bild. 'Since the World Cup semi-final against Germany people give me less respect.

'No-one thinks about whether it could break my career or the pressure it has put on me.'

Dante has won back-to-back Bundesliga titles since joining Bayern from Borussia Monchengladbach in 2012. 

He also played a key role in winning two German Cups, the Champions League, European Super Cup and Club World Cup.

Despite this, fans are quick to point out flaws in his game and the Brazilian believes this is a result of his country's disappointing performance at the World Cup. 

He said: 'I am sure that if I had come back as a world champion, people would judge me very differently - even if I was playing exactly the same as I am now.'
