David Silva is determined to win the Champions League and make Manchester City ‘one of the top teams in the world’ after signing a new five-year deal at the Etihad.

Silva becomes the third player to agree new terms in recent months after Samir Nasri and Aleksandar Kolarov committed their futures to the Premier League champions, and Sergio Aguero and Vincent Kompany are expected to be next.

Silva has won two Premier League titles, the FA Cup and Capital One Cup since joining City for £24m from Valencia four years ago. Now the mercurial Spain midfielder wants to conquer Europe.

Asked what he wants to win before his new deal expires in 2019, he said: ‘The Champions League definitely. It’s a title I really want to win. I think we are on a good path and hopefully we can win it some day. It’s a good challenge for this year. We also want to win other titles. We want to fight for every trophy.

‘I think we are doing things well. We won the Premier League and the Capital One Cup last season and we have to continue like this. We are signing good players and I’m sure we will fight for titles.’

Silva, who is believed to be on a wage package worth £200,000 a week, admitted that he didn’t have to think twice when City approached him over a new deal.

‘It was a straightforward decision to extend my stay here and spend my peak years at Manchester City, a club with unbelievable fans who have always supported me,’ he added.

‘From the moment I joined the club four years ago it has felt like a second home to me. On and off the pitch, I feel incredibly content and fulfilled professionally and personally, so why wouldn’t I want to stay and keep winning trophies with this fantastic team?

‘Over the last four years, we have achieved so much together, establishing City as a dominating force in England and now, when I look around this dressing-room, I can see no reason why we won’t become one of the top teams in the world.’

As well as re-signing their key players to new contracts, City have also spent close to £50m this summer on Eliaquim Mangala, Willy Caballero, Fernando and Bruno Zuculini. Bacary Sagna has moved from Arsenal as a free agent and Frank Lampard is on a six-month loan from City’s US franchise New York City.

‘They are all great players,’ said Silva. ‘The club is doing very well signing very good players and I’m sure they will give a lot to the team. That’s also good for competition. Every time there is competition the level is higher.

‘Lampard has a lot of experience. He is a great player and I’m sure he will give his best and give a lot to the team.’
