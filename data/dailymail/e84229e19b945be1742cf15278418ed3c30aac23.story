The alleged gunman who was shot dead after opening fire on a federal courthouse in Wheeling, West Virginia this afternoon has been identified as a former police officer in the town.

Thomas Picard, who reportedly left Wheeling Police Department 15-years-ago has been named as the man who fired up to 20 shots from an assault rifle at the town's federal courthouse around 2.30 p.m. before security officers returned fire and shot him dead.

One security officer within the Wheeling Federal Building was injured by flying debris and two others were admitted to Wheeling hospital with injuries, said Chief Deputy Mike Claxton of the Marshals Service in northern West Virginia.

Picard was initially hospitalized in a critical condition but later succumbed to his injuries.

Investigators were seeking a search warrant for the gunman's home in hopes of determining the motive and if he acted alone according to Claxton.

Asked if the gunman had any beef with the U.S. government, Claxton said, 'We're really digging hard at this point to find out.'

Claxton said the man began firing from a parking lot across from the federal building. 'He was observed in the parking lot very quickly after the first shots were fired,' he said.

Courthouse security and local police ultimately returned fire and hit the man. He did not know if there was an exchange of gunfire.

The building houses a variety of courtrooms and related offices.

'This is a federal building with judges and prosecutors and law enforcement,' Claxton said. 'It's a very serious incident that infringes upon the third branch of government.'

City resident Carla Webb Daniels said she saw the man identified as Piccard reload his assault rifle and then fire at a nearby YWCA. She said he fired between 25 and 30 rounds.

'I was so nervous, I couldn't believe it,' Daniels said according to the Intelligencer. 'People were scared and were banging on the doors asking to be let in.'

Another witness, Carla Daniels, told the Metro News that she was working nearby and saw the gunman.

'I saw a guy with a rifle and he was just pointing in toward the federal building and just shooting.Â 

'After he fired so many shots, he reached down on the ground and he must have reloaded and he went back to shooting again,' Daniels said.
