Ronald Phillips is a death row inmate who raped and killed a three-year-old girl

The governor has now changed his mind and decided to delay a death row inmate's execution so that they can see if there is a way to donate his organs to his sick relatives.

Convicted child killer Ronald Phillips made a last-minute request have his organs to both his sick mother and members of the public, and initially prison officials said no because of security issues.

Phillips' mother has kidney disease and is on dialysis and his sister has a heart condition.

Governor John Kasich also rejected Phillips' plea of mercy last week, but after the murderer's lawyers submitted a request to have his organs be put to good use, the state officials have decided to try to make the option work.

Phillips was scheduled to die on Thursday for the rape and death of his girlfriend's 3-year-old daughter in Akron in 1993 but now his death has been pushed back.

The death row inmate had maintained through attorneys that the request was not a delay tactic but a final gesture of goodwill. His execution has now been pushed back to July 2.

In stopping the execution, Kasich said he wanted to allow time to study the request the 40-year-old inmate made Monday to see if a donation could help someone else.

Kasich said that if Phillips is found to be a viable donor to his mother, who has kidney disease and is on dialysis, or to others awaiting live transplants of non-vital organs, the stay would allow time for those procedures to be performed and for Phillips to be returned to death row.

Kasich said that while Phillips' crime was heinous, his willingness to donate organs and tissue could save another life and the state should try to accommodate a donation.

Phillips was sentenced to death for raping and killing his girlfriend's daughter, three-year-old Sheila Marie Evans (pictured), in Akron in 1993

'I realize this is a bit of uncharted territory for Ohio, but if another life can be saved by his willingness to donate his organs and tissues then we should allow for that to happen,' Kasich said in a statement.

Some 3,500 people in Ohio and more than 120,000 nationally are currently awaiting organ donations, said Marilyn Pongonis, a spokeswoman for the Lifeline of Ohio organ donation program.

A spokeswoman said the department moved swiftly to evaluate the request but determined it was not equipped to accommodate pre- or post-execution organ donations.

Phillips also wants to donate his heart to his sister, who suffers a heart ailment.

It appears that request would not be possible under the governor's directive, since the heart is a vital organ and cannot be donated after death. The person must be alive when the organ is donated.

'It just wouldn't be possible,' Pongonis said.

Phillips will be injected with a never-been-used combination of midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, a painkiller. He has been languishing on death row for 20 years

'Organ donation occurs following brain death and the organs are maintained on a ventilator. When a prisoner is executed, the oxygen stops flowing, the heart stops beating, the blood stops flowing.'

Vital organ donations raise larger ethical issues and have so far not been allowed during U.S. executions, said Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center.

Phillips made his request after the governor denied him mercy and Phillips had exhausted his other legal options. His attorney said it wasn't a delay tactic but an attempt to do good.

The state had left it up to Phillips' family whether the organs would be harvested after his death.

Phillips had been moved to Ohio's death house Wednesday, but a prisons spokeswoman said he was being returned to death row immediately after Kasich's stay was issued to await the assessment's findings.
