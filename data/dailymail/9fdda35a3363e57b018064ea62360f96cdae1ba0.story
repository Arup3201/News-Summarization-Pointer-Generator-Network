A man attacked by thugs on holiday was sent home with a bleed on his brain by a Bulgarian hospital because he didn't have his insurance document to hand.

Adam Prosser, of Fforestfach, Swansea, who works for a disabled children's charity, was on holiday in the beach resort of Obzor, Bulgaria, with his girlfriend Kayley Harrison, 19, when he was brutally set upon by a group of men.

But when the 27-year-old arrived at hospital with blood streaming from his ear, doctors refused to treat him because the couple did not have their European Health Insurance Card to show.

The attack happened earlier this month - a day before the couple were due to return to South Wales.

Miss Harrison, who works for a housing charity, said the onslaught happened as the pair were enjoying drinks with friends.

The following day they flew home as planned and when Mr Prosser went to Morriston Hospital in Swansea to have his injuries checked he was transferred to the University of Wales Hospital in Cardiff after being diagnosed with bleeding on the brain and two fractures to his skull.

He is currently in a stable condition.

Miss Harrison said: 'It was our final evening of a fantastic holiday and we were having a drink at another resort with a couple we had met during the week.

'At about 11.30pm we said goodbye and went to leave so we could go back to our hotel as we were flying home the next morning.

'Before we could leave the bar this group of four or five men just piled onto Adam for no reason punching and kicking him.

'I tried to intervene by putting my legs over his head to protect him and when they realised that they'd hurt me too and I was bleeding they stopped.

'Adam stood in the way and tried to protect me so they started punching him again.

'We managed to run outside to try and get in a taxi but he lost his flip flop and one of the gang just came over and punched him to the floor.

'That's what did the real damage - he was unconscious for six or 7 minutes.

'When we got to the medical centre with the paramedics they sent us to a hospital in Borgor half an hour away.

'The doctors asked for our insurance card but because we didn't have it on us they just said: 'No, we can't treat you'.'

She said that because they could not afford to pay up front they made Mr Prosser fill out a form and they had to leave.

'The doctor said he was lucky to survive the flight,' she added.

'Because it is in the EU and it's an emergency they should have just treated him - it's a disgrace.'

Miss Harrison said on her Facebook account after receiving messages of support: 'A massive thank u 2 everyone that has sent their wishes and support to me, ad's family and my family at this sad time.

Apologies for not getting back to everyone but my handsome man is a fighter and will pull through this without a doubt. Thanks again guys! X'

Obzor is a small town and seaside resort on the Black Sea coast of Bulgaria. The pair had started their holiday there on May 16.

Miss Harrison said the couple were having a fantastic holiday before the attack and she posted a number of pictures of the couple enjoying themselves on Facebook.

But she said after the attack: 'It has put me off going on holiday abroad for life now.'

She said Mr Prosser was conscious in hospital.
