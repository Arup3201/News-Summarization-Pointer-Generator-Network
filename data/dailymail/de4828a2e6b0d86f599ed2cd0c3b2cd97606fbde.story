Cyclists may be allowed to run red lights and cars banned from entering bike lanes in an attempt to make roads more bike-friendly and reduce conflict with motorists.

The measures are part of a number of reforms being considered by the Victorian government in a bid to get more cyclists on the road.

VicRoads is expected to release a report of a possible overhaul of Victoria's road rules by the end of the year and have already started looking at results from an online survey that asked for feedback on cycling road rules.

Among the options being considered is allowing cyclists to treat red lights as give way signs, the Herald Sun reports.

Banning cyclists' use of headphones and requiring motorists to be one metre away from cyclists are also on the radar.

Under current road rules, cyclists must stop at traffic lights and face the same penalties as motorists if they run a red light.

Vehicles may also be banned from entering bike lanes under the potential reforms. At the moment they can drive in bike lanes to park or make a turn for up to 50 metres.

Victoria's reforms on road rules comes as a young women was killed at a cyclist 'danger zone' in Brisbane on Thursday.

Brisbane CIty Council was warned a number of times about the area before the 22-year-old cyclist was involved in a collision with a truck at the corner of Stanley Street and Annerley Road in South Brisbane.

She was stopped at a red light when she was hit by a semi trailer trailer that was travelling in the same direction.

Cycling group cycle.org.au have contacted the council in writing and in person since July warning that the area was 'a disaster waiting to happen' for cyclists, the Brisbane Times reports.

While the council conducted a road safety review of the area and cut back overgrown vegetation, replaced signs and repainted existing bikes lanes, cycle.org.au Queensland director Stephen Mitchell said he was disappointed by the lack of real change.

'What does happen in Brisbane City Council is that they go to their own internal sources and refer to a manual and create lines on a road that don't improve protection or safety for cyclists in any way, shape or form,' Mr Mitchell said.

'I don't even know if what is there [at Annerley] is much of a bikeway.'

Vehicles may also be banned from entering bike lanes under the potential reforms. At the moment they can drive in bike lanes to park or make a turn for up to 50 metres

'Police Inspector Rob Graham urged drivers to be considerate of other road users at the scene of the crash on Thursday.Â 

'It's tragic circumstances. And it just highlights to me the important need for the shared space on the roadway for all traffic, pedestrians, bikes, cars and trucks,' he said.
