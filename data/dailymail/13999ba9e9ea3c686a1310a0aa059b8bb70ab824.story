Barcelona have come in for criticism in Sunday's Spanish papers after a goalless draw at Getafe left them trailing Real Madrid by four points at the top of La Liga.

'Barca disconnected' reads the headline on the front of AS, which features a picture of frustrated manager Luis Enrique stood on the sidelines in pouring rain.

'We were superior to our opponents,' he said afterwards but Barca were stifled and could even had lost if the referee had not blown for full time when Alvaro Vazquez was muscling his way towards goal in the final seconds.

Real Madrid, meanwhile, jet off to play in the FIFA Club World Cup in Morocco this week knowing they'll be top of the table at Christmas.

Their historic run of victories was extended to 20 across all competitions when they beat Almeria 4-1 on Friday night.

Marca is also keen to hail the defending European champions, calling Barcelona's plight a 'fiasco' and also hailing Pepe, who is 'the cleanest centre-back in the League.'

Contrary to reputation, Pepe has made the least fouls and been shown the lowest number of yellow cards in the last 40 matches.

As might be expected from a Madrid publication, they stick the boot into Barcelona, saying Luis Enrique had no idea how to get his team out a jam.

Catalan paper Mundo Deportivo go for the simple headline - 'water' - in reference to the pouring Madrid rain that thwarted Barca's attacking instincts at Getafe.

Pictured is Luis Suarez slipping up as he tries to shoot for goal on the soggy surface. 'Barca remained loyal to their style,' they write, but are now crucially four point behind Real.

Lionel Messi struck the crossbar but the Argentine missed Neymar, who was left out of the travelling party as a precaution on an ankle problem.

While four points does not seem an insurmountable margin to make up, Sport run the headline 'red alert' and there is criticism for Luis Enrique, who has not used the same team in any of his 22 matches in charge.

Sergio Busquets suggested that Barcelona's performance may have been down to fatigue following their midweek win over Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League.

'We tried different ways of creating danger, we gave it all we could, and we're going away unhappy,' he told the club's official website.

'Perhaps we were still tired after Wednesday.'

Busquets suggested Barcelona can reel in Madrid despite their four-point advantage and 20-match winning streak.

'of course we'd rather be top, but there's a lot of the league still to play,' he said.

'We have to take things game-by-game and start cutting away at the difference bit-by-bit.'

Over in Italy, Gazzetta Sportiva tee up Sunday's Serie A action by pointing out that Juventus, Roma and AC Milan all face sides that they've struggled against in the recent past.

'The Bete Noir' is their headline, with a picture of some glowing cat's eyes.

Juventus face Sampdoria, against whom they have the worst record over the last two seasons as they try to build on their current three-point advantage.

Second placed Roma go to Genoa, where they have lost five of their last six meetings. Coach Rudi Garcia admitted: 'We need to turn over a new leaf.'

Milan, meanwhile, host a Napoli side they haven't beaten since February 2011.

Corriere dello Sport bill the day's action as a 'Battle of the Giants' and suggest that the two Genoa sides can decide the Scudetto.

Tuttosport are predicting a tough afternoon for Juve against Sampdoria, with Sinisa Mihajlovic set to make things tough for them in Turin.
