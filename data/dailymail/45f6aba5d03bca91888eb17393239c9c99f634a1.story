If Nigel Pearson survived telling a paying Leicester City fan to 'f*** off and die' from the touchline during a game at the King Power Stadium, it would be a surprise if he got the sack for grabbing an opposition player by the throat and refusing to let go of his shirt when he wanted to rejoin the game.

It was a bizarre incident with James McArthur on Saturday as the Foxes lost to Crystal Palace, something Pearson could easily have avoided or laughed off. Instead he has added to his burgeoning reputation as something of a loose cannon.

And that’s a shame.

Nigel Pearson gets to grips with Crystal Palace's James McArthur during this by-now infamous incident

Pearson appeared in relaxed mood in front of the media on Monday after a bizarre turn of events at Leicester

Six years ago Pearson was in charge of Leicester City in the third tier of English football: they were losing at local rivals Peterborough United and couldn’t even win at Hartlepool, currently rooted to the bottom of the football league. The club has come a long way, and after a spell away from the East Midlands, Pearson returned to lead Leicester to the Premier League in some style. He did very well not just to guide the club to the top flight, but also to finally bury their reputation as chokers.

Pearson needs to represent the club with much more class on the touchline, that’s for sure. But in my opinion he should be judged on the strikers he’s signed.

Since sealing promotion Pearson has been given more money to spend than the other two promoted sides, yet Leicester are bottom.

Pearson led Leicester to the Premier League promised land in his second stint in charge of the club

In the second full season of his second stint at  Leicester, Pearson led the Foxes to automatic promotion

Leonardo Ulloa came in from Brighton for a club record £8million last summer, and last month that record was broken again when Andrej Kramaric arrived for £9million.

Ulloa started brightly but has scored just twice in his last 19 league appearances. Kramaric has yet to score, and after he was left out of the starting line-up on Saturday, Pearson explained that the Premier League is 'ridiculously quick', and his big signing 'needs time to adjust'.

Leicester don’t have time, and with the strikers who took them up struggling – David Nugent has scored once since the win over Manchester United in September while Jamie Vardy has drawn a blank since that famous 5-3 victory – they need the record signings to deliver.

Pearson has been given the money, and he has put his faith in these two strikers. If they deliver the goals to keep Leicester up he’s been a success, if they don’t score and the Foxes go down, Pearson will have failed.

Tidying up his touchline act is the least of his concerns.
