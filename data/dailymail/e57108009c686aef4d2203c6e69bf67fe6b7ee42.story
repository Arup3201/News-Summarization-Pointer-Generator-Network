Belgium international Axel Witsel has spoken of his love for Manchester United and has not ruled out a move to play in the Premier League in the future.

Witsel has been plying his trade with Zenit Saint Petersburg since 2012 after earlier stints with Benfica and Standard Liege, but the 26-year-old midfielder admits he would love to test himself in England's top league someday.

'I want to play in one of the top clubs in Europe one day,' Witsel told bleacherreport.com.

'It’s true that I like the Premier League, because it is one of the best league’s in the world, for me, together with Germany and Spain. It is a very good league, it is a crazy league. A lot of my colleagues play there, but we will see.

'I am still young, only 26. We‘ll see in the future. I have always liked Manchester United from when I was young.'

Witsel has made 54 appearances for Belgium and represented his country during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.

Witsel, who is enjoying a mid-season break with his Zenit St. Petersburg team-mates in Doha, has been linked with a move to Arsenal and AC Milan in recent days.  

'No, these rumours are in the newspapers,' Witsel added.

'I don’t know anything about it. I am here in Qatar training to be focused on my team Zenit and to try to regain a good physical condition. Even during the holidays I did not think about leaving, I am focused.'
