Â It seems that the impossible has occurred: The nation's most congested city has become a model for traffic control.

Yes,
gridlock still prevails and drivers' blood pressure still spikes as 
LA's traffic arteries seize up during every morning and afternoon rush 
hour.

Yet, with the flip of a switch earlier 
this year, Los Angeles became a worldwide leader by synchronizing all of
its nearly 4,400 stoplights, making it the world's first major city to 
do so.

Synched up: all of Los Angeles' 4,400 stop lights are now synched up

The result? Well, it can still be hell 
to cross the City of the Angels by car. Synchronization has allowed LA 
to boast of real improvements on paper, however, the average driver 
won't always be able to discern the difference of a project that took 
nearly 30 years to complete.

"To be honest 
with you, I haven't felt it, yet," said Jack Abramyam, who has been 
driving a cab across LA's mean streets for 20 years.

"Late
at night, maybe, yes," Abramyam said as he sat outside his cab on a 
street in Chinatown recently, waiting for a fare. "But it was never 
really bad then anyway. During the day it was bad. And it's still bad."

The
way synchronization works is simple enough: With all the signals 
synchronized, if you drive down a street at the posted speed limit you 
should be able to make every green light - from one end of this 
sprawling city of 469 square miles to the other.

Of course there are any number of obstacles that can prevent that.

On
a recent mid-afternoon test drive down eight miles of Wilshire 
Boulevard, for example, I was cut off by a bus, stuck behind more than 
one right-turner waiting for pedestrians to cross the intersecting 
street and at one point had my lane blocked by a delivery truck.

Approaching
the world famous La Brea Tar Pits - where prehistoric dinosaurs once 
got stuck in muck, not traffic - so many people were waiting to turn 
left into a parking lot that the street became gridlocked for more than 
two blocks. The numerous synchronized green lights didn't wait for me. 
But why would they? With the posted speed limit 35 mph, I was only 
averaging 15.

Still, once the LA County Museum
of Art, the high-rise apartments, the headquarters of porn publisher 
Larry Flynt and the various other Wilshire Boulevard landmarks were in 
the rear-view mirror, the pace did pick up. So much so that 11 green 
lights in a row suddenly materialized. That string ended on the edge of 
downtown, however, when Wilshire simply became clogged with too many 
cars. It was a non-rush hour jam that demonstrated that, good as 
synchronization may be, it isn't a magic, traffic-breaking bullet.

Los Angeles Department of Transportation officials agree.

City of angels - and gridlock: Los Angeles freeways are amongst the most congested in the world

As
they stated in a recent report praising the benefits of synchronized 
signals, "No traffic signal system is capable of `fixing traffic.'"

If
more motor vehicles show up in the years ahead (and there are already 
more than 7.1 million of them registered in Los Angeles County, a number
greater than that of most states), then officials say LA traffic jams 
will probably get worse.

That's why, said 
Clinton Quan, an engineering associate with the Department of 
Transportation, planners are continuing to push people to ride bicycles,
take commuter rail lines and other public transportation and move close
enough to work that they can walk there.

The 
city has added three light rail lines in the last seven years and has 
more planned. Officials also recently approved plans to allow high-rise 
apartment and condominium buildings along a corridor in Hollywood where a
subway connecting the city's West Side to downtown is supposed to go.

In
the meantime, Quan says, the synchronized signal program is putting up 
some pretty impressive numbers, even if the average driver isn't 
noticing them. It has reduced the drive time on several major LA 
corridors, for example, by about 12 percent.

In driver-speak, that means the trip across town that used to take you an hour has been reduced to about 53 minutes.

And
that's nothing to shrug at, says Robert Puentes, a senior fellow with 
the Brookings Institution's metropolitan policy program, which studies 
among other things the impact of traffic on the quality of life in 
metropolitan areas.

Several other 
traffic-clogged cities are looking into instituting similar programs and
New York already synchronizes some of its stoplights, said Puentes, who
works in Washington, D.C., the ninth-worst traffic-clogged city in the 
country.

"If you can get a 12 percent reduction on, say, the Washington Beltway, that would be phenomenal," he said.
