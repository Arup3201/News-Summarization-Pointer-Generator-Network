Dunga has a tough task on his hands restoring  pride to the Brazilian national team after a disappointing World Cup, but perhaps taking some tips from Jose Mourinho will go a long way to helping.

The Brazil coach, a World Cup-winning captain in 1994, travelled to Chelsea's Cobham training ground on Friday, where he and his coaching staff had lunch with Mourinho.

'There was a long conversation with an exchange of ideas about football, of course, and information about the many Brazilian players with whom (Mourinho) trained in Europe', the Brazilian Football Confederation reported.

A hot topic for Mourinho at the moment is Oscar, and the Chelsea coach spoke to the media on Friday about his player reaching 'a different level'.

'The Brazil coach is here today and shares the same vision as me. He recognises Oscar has reached a different level in his game and also in his personality.

'His intention is always to improve. Is he the kind of kid who can play 12 times in one month? I don't think so. 

'But that we analyse the situation, we have other options, other players who can play in his position and his rest will obviously arrive to make sure we don't overload him with minutes of football.'

Dunga also chatted to Didier Drogba while he was at the Chelsea training ground on Friday

Dunga also visited Borussia Dortmund this week, where he met Jurgen Klopp with his technical committee Andrey Lopes and Gilmar Rinaldi.

Brazil have won all of their first six matches under Dunga's stewardship, with the likes of Willian, Oscar and Filipe Luis all playing a major role.

The Brazilian coach has a busy weekend of football to look forward to. He will be at Stamford Bridge to watch some of his international players face up against West Brom on Saturday afternoon, before hot-footing it across the capital for the late game of the day; Arsenal vs Manchester United.

On Sunday, he'll complete his trio of live games with a trip to Selhurst Park, where Crystal Palace host Liverpool.
