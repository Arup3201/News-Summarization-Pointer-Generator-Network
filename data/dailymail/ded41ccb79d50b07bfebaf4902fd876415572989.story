In Spain, all talk is of Wednesday night's Copa del Rey clash where Atletico Madrid bravely defended for 84minutes before a dubious penalty decision allowed Lionel Messi to give Barcelona the upper hand heading into the second leg.

The Argentinian phenomenon was once again seen vomiting on the pitch during the game, which has been a recurrent problem this season. According to Marca, the 27-year-old has undergone tests to determine the problem, which appears to be chronic sinusitis. 

Nonetheless, Messi is lauded by the likes of AS and Mundo Deportivo, although Madrid-friendly Marca leads with Diego Simeone's declaration that Atletico 'can come back'.

Despite the recent power struggle between Messi and coach Luis Enrique, Barcelona have rediscovered their form in recent weeks - something that has not gone unnoticed by Simeone.

'Barcelona have improved a great deal in these last two games,' he told a news conference.

'Above all in putting on the pressure in the opponents' half,' added the former Argentina captain. 'It was their strength that they did not allow us to bring the ball out.'

Elsewhere in La Liga, Real Madrid continue to attract the world's most sought after players both for the present and the future.

Meanwhile, cup competitions also dominated the news in Italy where Roberto Mancini's Inter Milan reached the quarter-finals with a 2-0 victory over Sampdoria. 

Arsenal loan signing Lukas Podolski scored along with fellow new arrival Xherdan Shaqiri - while Fiorentina defeated Atalanta 3-1 in Wednesday night's other game, which included a goal from Chelsea target Juan Cuadrado.

Southampton striker Dani Osvaldo, who is currently on loan with Inter and has been linked with a move to QPR, is back in the bad books after going 'missing for several days without explanation' and has been duly suspended, according to La Gazetta dello Sport.

Despite his problems, Corriere dello Sport claim that both AC Milan and Juventus are keen to take advantage of his situation to boost their strike forces.

Juve have also been linked with a move for Sassuolo striker Simone Zaza, although the struggling Serie A side want to be assured of safety before agreeing a deal, sayTuttosport.
