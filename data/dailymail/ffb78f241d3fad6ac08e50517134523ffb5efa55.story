Tottenham's Europa League clash with Besiktas was suspended twice after the floodlights in the ground suddenly went out.

Referee Stefan Johannesson had to halt play in the eighth minute and send the players back to the dressing rooms before the problem could be resolved, with  a thirteen minute delay in play.

The floodlights went out again in second-half stoppage time and after a brief delay the players  returned to play out the final few minutes.

It's the second successive Europa League match to be suspended for Tottenham following pitch invaders interrupting play at White Hart Lane against Partizan Belgrade last month.

The sparse section of supporters did their best to light up the stadium with their phones and  the lighting issues were resolved within quarter of an hour and the players came back out to continue the match.

With the game at 1-0 thanks to Cenk Tosun's second-half strike, the floodlights cut out again in the 91st minute with Johannesson forced to suspend play in Istanbul for a second time.

Mauricio Pochettino's side were vying with their opponents for top spot in Group C, and the Turkish side surpassed Spurs to take first place

On Thursday it was announced that Tottenham have been fined 15,000 euros (£11,870) by UEFA over the three pitch invasions during match against Partizan Belgrade, which Spurs won 1-0.

The match on November 27 at White Hart Lane was suspended late in the first-half following three separate pitch invasions, which appeared to be a planned PR stunt.

The three pitch invaders wore T-shirts bearing the name of a headphone manufacturer associated with Spurs and six other Premier League teams, as they attempted to take selfies with Spurs players.

UEFA's control, ethics and disciplinary body (CEDB) fined Spurs with the police having already charged the three men involved which caused the match to be delayed for around 10 minutes just before half-time.
