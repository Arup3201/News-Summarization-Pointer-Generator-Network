Shimilia Seetal, 20, pictured, died of a suspected drug overdose on a night out with friends

A 20-year-old student has died of a suspected drugs overdose after collapsing during a night out clubbing with friends, it emerged today.

College student Shamilia Seetal is believed to have taken ecstasy while out in Bedford town centre on Friday night with her boyfriend Kane Lilleyman, 22, and friends.

But emergency services were called after she collapsed inside Elements night club at the 'Nightmare Before Christmas' event at around 3.30am on Saturday morning.

She was rushed to Bedford Hospital but was pronounced dead just after 6am.

Yesterday it emerged Shamilia - who was affectionately known as Shimmy - had been due to celebrate her 21st birthday on Christmas Eve. 

Friends revealed on social networking sites that Shimmy, from Lincoln, had taken ‘pills’ - a slang term for ecstasy - during the dance music event at the popular night-spot.

Police could not confirm whether she had taken any illegal substances but said they were not treating the death as suspicious.

A spokesman for Bedfordshire Police said: 'Officers were called to reports a death at just after 6am on Saturday, after she had been taken to Bedford Hospital.

'It is understood she had fallen ill while enjoying a night out with friends. We are not treating her death as suspicious at this stage and the coroner had been informed.'

A spokesman for East of England Ambulance Service said another man with Shimmy was also treated and taken to hospital.

He said: 'We were called at around 3.30am to the Elements night club in Mill Street to reports a man in his 30’s and another female casualty had collapsed.

She said: 'He was a different person with her. She was beautiful, inside and out, and will continue to be.

'She stayed with us so often, she became like an extra daughter - even tidying boyfriend Kane’s room.

'She was always going out with friends, she had a lot of friends who used to come back here but I wouldn’t mind.

'I considered her my daughter in law whether they were married or not.

'She was his first love, and he loved her so much. He told me he gave her a kiss goodbye, but he didn’t want to say goodbye. I said; none of us do.

'He said it was the worst day of his life, that he wanted to grow old with her and she was his shimmy.'

Her boyfriend Kane took to Facebook, writing: 'Identifying my girlfriend’s body was without a doubt the hardest I have ever done.

'I love you shimmy and I will never stop loving you! rest in peace my beautiful angel we will meet again sometime soon I’m sure. going to miss you so much shimmy it’s unreal.'

Shimmy lived with her mother Marissa, 39, who was yesterday being comforted by pals.

One neighbour added: 'Shimmy lost her dad a couple of years back too. Marissa is inconsolable.'
