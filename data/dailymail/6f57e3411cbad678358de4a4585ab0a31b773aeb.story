A British man who lives as an Apache Indian is fighting a court battle after being found with illegal badger paws and eagle wings in his home.

Mangas Colaradas, 60, claimed the wild animal relics are part of the Native American lifestyle he has lived for 20 years - despite being born and raised in Swansea.

But he was arrested after the body parts of the wild animals were found in his home filled with his Apache collection.

Colaradas wore ceremonial head-dress when he appeared in court today, charged under the Protection of Badgers Act and the Wildlife and Countryside Act over the badger and eagle relics.

Pleading not guilty: Apache Indian Mangus Colardas from Swansea, South Wales, says the animal relics in his possession are part of his heritage

But Colaradas pleaded not guilty - and has vowed to fight the case on the grounds that it is part of his Apache lifestyle.

He wore a ceremonial head dress, tassled jacket, suede moccasins and a snake’s head necklace to deny the charge at Swansea magistrates court.

Anne Griffiths, defending, said: 'My client Mangas is part of a native American Apache tribe.

'He has spent time living in these Apache communities and this is his belief.'

The Apache people, split over around 13 tribes, are  usually found in Arizona, New Mexico and Texas.

Apache was originally a word given to the natives' enemies, known as the Zuni.

But over time the word became adopted worldwide and is even used by the Apaches themselves.

There are thought to be about 30,000 Apaches left in America.

The
Apache tribes were nearly wiped out by Europeans. They now have their 
own areas, or 'reservations', to live on, where they can live by their 
own customs and rules, but they must still obey the U.S. law.

A
stereotypical Apache image might be an Indian with his horse. However 
horses did not exist in North American until colonists arrived - but the
Apaches quickly adopted them and used them for transport.

Colaradas was released on bail and is due to stand trial in August.

Outside court, the father-of-six told of his Apache lifestyle in his three-bedroom detached house in the Townhill suburb of Swansea.

He said: 'I dress like this all the time I’m not just some weekend Indian. I don’t put it on to show off, I put it on because I want to wear it.

'I’m against modern life, nobody cares about anybody else, nobody cares about mother earth.

'The whole point of the Native American lifestyle is that everyone believes in mother earth and treats others who you want to be treated.'

Colaradas began living a Native American lifestyle after he divorced from his wife in the early 1990s.

He adopted his name in honour of a famous Apache chief and now refuses to answer to anything else.

In 1997 he travelled to United States to try and live on a Red Indian reservation but the American government would not let him.

He then moved to Spain in 2000 wear he lived in a tipee in the mountains and the forest around Torremolinos.

He said: 'I prefer being out in the wild, watching the wolves or bats or spiders going by.

'I believe in enjoying life and taking things as they come. I like sitting in wide open spaces, relaxing, being myself and being at one with nature.

'I have the motto Hóka-héy, which means it is a good day to die. I live everyday like it could be my last for we are only on this world for a short time.'

Colaradas now makes his own tomahawks, bows and arrows as well as running snake shows.

The animal lover added: 'I’ve cured thousands of people of their fear of snakes, I don’t believe in money, I just do it to educate people.

'I get on with animals better than most people I’ve got an affinity with them there are no bad animals just bad keepers.

'I’ve owned hundreds of snakes in my time, I eat them when they die, we Natives don’t believe in letting anything go to waste.'
