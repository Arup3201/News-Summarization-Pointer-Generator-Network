A blogger who started one of the world's biggest social media websites from his Scottish bedroom because it was 'something to do without getting out of bed' is set to become a multimillionaire amid the likely sale of the site to U.S. news giant CNN for $200million.

Pete Cashmore, now 26, created Mashable.com from his room in Banchory, Aberdeenshire, in 2005 when he was just 19 in a bid to escape the boredom of his studies.

Seven years on, the technology news site now has its head office in New York and Cashmore, who was once dubbed the 'planet's sexiest geek', is set to live up to his name by becoming one of the world's wealthiest men.

If the buyout by CNN takes place it will cement Cashmore's success as a dotcom multimillionaire and marks another milestone in the extraordinary rise of the former teenage blogger.

Now employing more than 40 people, Mashable covers and aggregates a wide
 range of news related to the fast-evolving social media and Internet 
sector covering companies ranging from start-ups to larger players 
including Facebook and Twitter and has 50 million page views a month.

Money-maker: Pete Cashmore grew up in a modest house in Aberdeen

Like
 other mainstream news outlets CNN, which is owned by Time Warner Inc and was founded by Ted Turner in 1980, 
has been trying to expand its digital business to compete more effectively in 
the web-based social media age.    

Last August it bought Zite, a news application for the iPad designed to give users a personalised magazine-like experience, for up to £16million.

However, it has played down reports of a sale, with a spokesman saying the company did not 'engage in speculation'.

Cashmore, who already writes a blog for CNN, went to his local school, Banchory Academy, but was forced to spend large amounts of time at home following problems after surgery for appendicitis aged 13 and fell behind with his studies.

It was then the self-described 'geek' discovered the internet which became his bedside companion and he began to blog about social media. 

He said working on the site made him feel like he was achieving something in bed and following his health problems said he had become 'driven'.

The site soon began to make a small amount of money from advertising each month and he was able to take on another writer.

Big business: The Mashable site is now worth £127million and has 50million viewers a month with two offices in America

It was at this point Cashmore turned his back on university and decided to concentrate on the site full time.

Now Cashmore, who is reportedly dating model Lisa Bettany, divides 
his time between Scotland, San Francisco and New York, where the company has offices.

With his chiselled good looks - he is now dubbed 'Brad Pitt of the blogosphere' - he has been a Time Magazine 100 in 2010, and a Forbes magazine web celeb 25.

He was also named a Briton of the year by the Telegraph in 2010 and last year was named a World Economic Forum Young Global Leader.

Speaking about the rise of Mashable 
he told Canada's Globe and Mail in an earlier interview: 'Not only did I not 
have connections, I wasn't in [Silicon] Valley.

Cashmore grew up in Banchory, 18 miles from Aberdeen.

He was educated at the Banchory Academy but suffered health problems following surgery for appendicitis aged 13.

Forced to recover at home he started spending time on the internet and began blogging about social networking aged 19.

He then turned his back on university and decided to work on the site full time when it began to take off.

The company is now said to be worth £127m and has offices in New York and San Francisco and he is dating model and photographer Lisa Bettany, pictured with the entrepreneur above.

'But
 I did have an outsider perspective, and as it turned out that was an 
advantage because there's a mass market that wants to know what the 
coolest gadgets are and how to use Facebook, Twitter and other 
[technology] to get ahead.'

Cashmore,
 who now has more than 2.2million followers on Twitter, says he doesn't 
own a television and doesn't watch movies claiming he prefers to 
'participate' via the internet rather than be 'broadcast to'.

He
 said he didn't tell his parents about his website and they only learned
 of his success when a Daily Mail reporter knocked on the door.

Technology blogger Felix Salmon said the
 deal could be announced today, although another person 
familiar with the matter said it was not likely to be announced this 
week.

CNN
 spokeswoman Christa Robinson, commenting on the Mashable reports said: 
'We do not engage in speculation about our business and we aren’t 
commenting on these reports.'    

A Mashable spokesman was not immediately available.
