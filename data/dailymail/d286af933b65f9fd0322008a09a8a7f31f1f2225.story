A crafty thief who dressed in smart golfing gear to bluff his way into elite country clubs in order to steal cash and credits cards from the locker rooms has been arrested.

Oscar Cabrera, 33, would wear polo shirts, golf pants, spiked shoes and a glove on one hand during his elaborate scam, which police believe he may have carried out at countless clubs across the country.

Cops have also arrested his partner in crime Luis Paz, 34, who wouldn’t have blended in quite so easily at 5ft 7inches and 450 pounds and so acted as getaway driver. 

Caught in the act: Cabrera caught on CCTV footage at Baltusrol and then, right, at Millburn police station in his smart golfing gear 

Both men hail from Miami and were caught on CCTV footage last month after carrying out their sting at the exclusive Baltusrol Golf Club in Springfield, New Jersey.

‘Based upon their attire, as to be able to blend in with players at the club, it was obvious to my detectives that these suspects may have committed similar crimes in the past,’ and Springfield Police Chief John Cook.

At Baltusrol - where the U.S. Open has been played seven times - Cabrera is alleged to have stolen a stash of credit cards from members’ unlocked lockers.

He and Paz are then accused of taking the stolen credit cards to at least two nearby stores and purchasing $8,000 in gift cards before their behavior aroused suspicions at a Target store and they promptly left.

In his smart golfing gear Cabrera, left, was able to blend in at the country clubs but his large accomplice Paz, right, stayed in their vehicle and was getaway driver 

Springfield cops were able to match Target’s surveillance footage to video of the men at Baltusrol and send out an alert.

When the duo tried their trick again - on July 20 - it was at the Canoe Brook Country Club in Summit, New Jersey where staff, armed with video images of Cabrera, were ready.

‘He asked for the men’s room, and he walked off when a worker confronted him,’ Capt. Michael Palardy of the Millburn Police Department told the New York Post.

‘He was wandering around the locker room and couldn’t give a straight answer for why he was there.’

A chase ensued, with Cabrera on foot and caddies and other workers in pursuit on foot and in golf carts, Palardy said.

Police were called and Cabrera was arrested. His partner Paz escaped, but was apprehended on Aug. 1, in Queens, New York.

Cabrera is being held at the Union County jail in Elizabeth in lieu of $200,000 bail, while Paz is awaiting extradition to New Jersey.

Authorities are confident that video surveillance from county clubs elsewhere in the country will show that the pair have carried out the same sting before.

They have been linked to at least three other country clubs in Jersey - in Manalapan, Edison and Springfield - which were all struck on the same day in June.
