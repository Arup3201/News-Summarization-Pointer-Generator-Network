The former fiance of singer Amy Winehouse raped a friend as she slept and then told her: ‘I always wanted to do this to you’, a court heard yesterday.

Film director Reg Traviss, 35, attacked the fashion designer, a friend of five years, twice in his flat after a drunken night out, it was alleged.

After the attack he told her he was going to keep her underwear, it was claimed.

Traviss had been in a relationship 
with Miss Winehouse from early 2010 and they were planning to marry when
she died of alcohol poisoning in July 2011 aged 27.

The alleged attack took place six 
months later on December 30, after Traviss and the designer drank 
cocktails in three central London bars.

At the end of the night the woman was
allegedly too drunk to stand. Traviss  persuaded her to go back to his 
flat in Marylebone, it was said. The victim claims this was the last 
thing she remembered before waking up to him raping her. Traviss then 
stopped when she asked him to and offered her a drink.

After drinking a glass of wine the 
woman passed out again. She then woke up to find him raping her for a 
second time, Southwark Crown Court was told.

She said she remembered drifting in 
and out of consciousness and hearing Traviss say: ‘Oh, I always wanted 
to do this to you.’ She later told police: ‘It felt just like a bad 
dream.’

Katherine Lumsdon, prosecuting, told the jury: ‘She said she would not have consented to sex even if she had been conscious.’

Miss Lumsdon told the jury that the pair drank cocktails, several rum and coke drinks and shots during their night out.

The prosecutor added: ‘She asked Reg 
to put her in a cab so that she could go home. He suggested she stay at 
his as it was closer. She was also aware that a black cab was unlikely 
to take her as she couldn’t stand.

‘She remembers him asking, “Would you like to stay at mine?” She does not remember her reply, but assumes she said yes.

‘That’s the last thing she remembers before waking up in his bed.’

She realised what was happening, asked what he was doing and told him to stop.

‘He stopped. She was very shocked,’ 
said Miss Lumsdon. ‘She could not process what had happened and could 
hardly believe it. He was acting as if nothing had happened at all.’

The woman was ‘extremely weak’ and 
was unable to get out of bed until the afternoon. As she got dressed she
realised she could not find her underwear and asked Traviss if he had 
seen it. Traviss allegedly replied: ‘I actually want to keep them.’

Giving evidence from behind a screen, the woman said she had thought Traviss would be sleeping on the sofa.

She said: ‘I remember waking up in his bed and he was having sex with me. I couldn’t understand what was going on.

‘I fell asleep again and I woke up to
him doing the same thing to me. At that point I was so tired. I had 
this blurry understanding of what was happening.

‘I wasn’t sure if it was a dream or if it was happening and I passed out again.

‘I did not expect it to happen. I did not want to have sex with him.

‘I don’t fancy him and I would not have said yes if I was sober.’

Traviss was dating singer Amy Winehouse before she died last year aged 27

She said that Traviss had been 
someone she saw a few times a year but after Miss Winehouse’s death she 
decided to spend more time with him.

‘His ex-girlfriend had just died. He 
was quite shattered and distressed and I felt bad for not spending more 
time with him,’ she said.

The court heard that at the time the 
woman did not understand ‘the full scale of what had happened to her’ 
and did not give police a full account until February. Traviss was 
arrested on April 5.

In a police interview he disputed her account, claiming she was only ‘seven out of ten’ drunk and that the sex was consensual.

Traviss denies two counts of rape. The trial continues.
