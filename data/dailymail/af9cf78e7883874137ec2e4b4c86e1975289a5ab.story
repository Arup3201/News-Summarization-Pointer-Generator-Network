Miguel Cotto's proposed fight against Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez has been scrapped.

The middleweight clash had been penciled in for May 2 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas - the same date as Floyd Mayweather Jnr's potential fight with Manny Pacquiao.

But Alvarez's promoter Oscar De La Hoya revealed his fighter will now look elsewhere.

'The deal is off the table with Cotto,' he said. 'They did not accept. So Canelo decided to move on. We had a deadline. 

'We had our fifth deadline [Friday night], and Canelo has decided, because Cotto turned down the deal, he is obviously not going to be waiting for nobody.

'He has to move on and resume his career and we have to lock down an opponent. He's still fighting May 2.'

The fight had been expected to reignite the Mexico-Puerto Rico rivalry, one of the oldest in boxing.

But this latest development also raises questions over whether Mayweather will indeed fight Pacquiao.

The $200million mega-fight appeared to be on the verge of being announced but rumours over a rematch between Mayweather and Cotto have persisted.

Mayweather comfortably outpointed the 34-year-old three years ago and another fight would not go down well with fans desperate to see the pound-for-pound No 1 finally face Pacquiao. 

De La Hoya also said that he would only move Alvarez from the May 2 date if Mayweather fights Pacquiao.

The two long-time rivals appeared to be on the verge of an historic agreement last week when the Filipino's promoter Bob Arum said his charge had signed the contract and was waiting on Mayweather doing likewise.
