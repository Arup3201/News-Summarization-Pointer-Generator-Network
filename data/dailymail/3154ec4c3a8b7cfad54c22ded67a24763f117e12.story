Literary giant Sir Salman Rushdie is romancing New York designer and socialite Missy Brody after escorting her to a string of parties.

Sir Salman,65, has been seen with Melissa 'Missy' Brody at a series of posh events recently, including Vanity Fair's Tribeca Film Festival bash last week - and the brunette does seem to bear a striking resemblance to his ex-wife Padma Lakshmi.

Missy, who at 45 is 20 years Salman's junior, was previously married to businessman Brian Krauss and the pair shared a home in New Jersey's upscale Saddle River.

A spokesman for Sir Salman today confirmed to MailOnline that the couple are dating.

New love: Famed scribe Salman Rushdie and fashion designer Missy Brody have 'known each for years', according to a friend.

Divorced: Missy Brody is believed to be divorced from businessman Brian Krauss. The couple are seen here in New York in 2007.

Page Six today reported Salman and Missy met through mutual friends and “have known each other for years.”

They posed for pictures at the New York City Opera spring gala on Thursday, where they entered holding hands.

They were also spotted at an Art Production Fund gala to honor Yoko Ono.

Missy is the daughter of wealthy fashion merchant Sheldon Brody, the chairman of Marcraft Apparel Group.

Lookalike: Sir Salman Rushdie's ex-wife Padma Lakshmi at the Sunlight Jr.' World Premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 20, 2013 in New York City.

Dating: Sir Salman Rushdie and Missy Brody at the Tribeca Film Festival Vanity Fair Party in New York on April 16.

Last year, Salman's attempts to wed for the fifth time were wrecked after a marriage 
proposal to his last girlfriend was reportedly rejected.

Michelle
Barish turned down the Midnight Children's author's request and gave back the seven-carat 
emerald-cut diamond ring he had given her, reported the New York Post.

The scribe is believed to have proposed to the stunning ex-wife of Chris Barish, the co-owner of nightclub chain Marquee in December 2011.

Unlikely lothario: Salman Rushdie dances with Michelle Barish at a previous birthday party. She turned down his marriage request in 2012 and returned a pricey ring.

That came just two days after she 
split from billionaire boyfriend Steve Tisch, New York Giants NFL 
co-owner and producer of Forrest Gump.

Ms Barish has a daughter named Bee 
with Mr Barish and declined Mr Rushdie’s offer so she can focus on her child, 
reported the New York Post.

She had been dating Mr Tisch since August 2011 after a friend set them up, but they reportedly ended their 
relationship in December that year.

Their time together came to an end at a
lavish party in the Gramercy Park Hotel in Manhattan, New York, at 
which Mr Rushdie was also present.

Split: Michelle Barish, left, had only been broken up from billionaire Steve Tisch, right, two days when Salman Rushdie proposed marriage in December 2011.

The evening was co-hosted by designer 
Stacey Bendet, a mutual friend of Ms Barish and Mr Rushdie, and she 
invited the author to the party.

The author chose to have a drink with 
Ms Barish in a separate part of the hotel away from the main party, a 
source close to him told MailOnline.

This came after Mr Rushdie ended his 
relationship with young socialite Devorah Rose. Neither Salman nor 
Ms Barish commented at the time.

Ms Rose, the busty and beautiful 
reality TV wannabe, said in December that Salman is a 'literary genius 
with the emotions of a horny child'.

Couple? Devorah Rose tweeted this photo of herself with Salman Rushdie at dinner, prompting him to say the pair were never romantically involved

She said she admired the acclaimed 
author, but when she wouldn't sleep with him, he dumped her and sullied 
her name in the press, she claimed.

He is said to have dumped her by text 
after she tweeted a photo of them together, though he claimed the pair 
were never romantically involved.

Three years ago he insisted he 
wouldn't rule out relationships completely but had no desire for a fifth
union, saying: 'There is no need to marry'.

Salman married his first wife 
Clarissa Luard in 1976 and had a son, Zafar. They split up in 1987 and 
he married Marianne Wiggins a year later.

They divorced in 1993, before he 
married his third wife Elizabeth West and then his fourth wife Padma 
Lakshmi, whom he split from in 2007.
