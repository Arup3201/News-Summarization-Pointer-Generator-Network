While most of us like a splosh of the red stuff with our chips, one ketchup obsessive is planning to drown her Christmas dinner in tomato sauce.

Samantha Archer, from Harrow, London, has been obsessed with ketchup since she was five years old, and gets through more than a whopping 36 litres of the condiment a year.

Ms Archer's two-bottle-a-week habit sees her consuming 700g every fortnight, spending more than £200 a year on various brands.

Samantha Archer from Harrow has been obsessed with tomato sauce since she was just five years old

The 30-year-old spends more than £200 a year on her habit. She douses all her meals with the red sauce

The 30-year-old spends five minutes dressing her plate each meal time and smothers everything from bread, meat and cheese to eggs, salad and curries with 104 bottles of the sauce a year. 

Ms Archer said: 'My family just know the deal and they always have a bottle of ketchup for me, they don't want any trouble.

Breakfast: Scrambled eggs with tomato ketchup or crumpets with melted cheese and tomato ketchup. 

Lunch: Pasta salad with ketchup or baked sweet potato with ketchup or ketchup sandwiches. 

Dinner: Chinese takeaway smothered in ketchup or stew and rice or  chicken curry - all flavoured and topped with ketchup. 

Snacks: A slice of ham filled with ketchup and folded into parcels or ketchup from a spoon. 

'I have ketchup on every meal and my Christmas dinner will be no different - Brussels sprouts and pigs in blankets dripping in ketchup is heaven.

'I am spending Christmas Day with my aunt and she is cooking for me. She always says I won't be able to taste the food she has cooked.

'But I can still taste the flavours - the ketchup just makes it better.

'I have it on absolutely everything, I can't think of anything I don't add it to.'

Ms Archer claims her first memory of ketchup dates back to when she was just five after her mum gave her her first taste - and she has been hooked ever since.

The financial accountant gets through two bottles of ketchup a week and douses her breakfast, lunch and dinner with her favourite condiment.

Ms Archer's friends and family always have bottles of ketchup for her as they 'don't want any trouble' 

And she is so obsessed with tomato sauce she even eats it straight from a spoon as a quick fix.

But she insists it doesn't ruin the taste of her meals and that she can still appreciate all the flavours in the food she eats.

She said: 'It takes me five minutes to dress my plate with sauce, I just love it.

'My friends and family are all used to my habits now and they keep a bottle to hand just in case I run out.

'And if they come round to visit they can expect to be fed ketchup.

'If I went out on a date I would warn them that I love tomato sauce - but people can never believe how much I actually put on the plate. They think I am joking.

'I don't know what I would do if I couldn't get my hands on ketchup, I would just have to find some before I could eat.

'I think the only thing I don't add tomato sauce to is soup. But I don't really eat soup - that is probably why.' 

Tomatoes have long been considered a health super-food. 

They contain lycopene, an antioxidant associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer. Some believe it may contribute to the general healthy functioning of the gland, which is integral in sexual function.

Lycopene is also known to be a powerful antioxidant, helping to prevent damage to cells in the body. 

Processed is better than fresh as it means the lycopene is concentrated.

The Institute of Nutrition in Jena, Germany, suggests that more than 15mg of lycopene daily may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. A typical serving of ketchup supplies 3mg.

While this may not sound much, you would have to eat five large slices of watermelon to get the same amount.

Dietary fat further aids the absorption of these antioxidants, so chips, occasionally, would be an ideal accompaniment.

Ketchup also contains lutein, which offers a small degree of protection for the eyes from macular degeneration.

Tests carried by scientists at the University of Oulo in Finland  showed that ketchup could be good for the heart by attacking 'bad' cholesterol, known as low-density lipoprotein.

Volunteers who added a few dollops of ketchup to their breakfast, lunch and tea, or drank a few glasses of tomato juice, saw their LDL levels drop significantly in the space of just three weeks.

Researchers said total cholesterol levels dropped by just under six per cent and LDL levels by almost 13 per cent.

They urged patients with high cholesterol to start eating ketchup or drinking tomato juice to help reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes.

In a report on the findings, published in the British Journal of Nutrition, they said: 'The changes we saw can be regarded as significant, considering that the time period was only three weeks and all the volunteers had normal cholesterol levels to start with.'
