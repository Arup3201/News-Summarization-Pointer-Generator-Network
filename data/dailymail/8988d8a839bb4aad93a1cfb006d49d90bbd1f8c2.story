They're often regarded as supermen, but the sporting world has been reminded in no uncertain terms this week that footballers are as heartbreakingly human and fragile as the rest of us.

The news that Newcastle United winger Jonas Gutierrez is battling testicular cancer, and cried when he received the diagnosis, will have touched even the toughest of souls these past few days.

None will have understood more what he is going through than Hibs manager Alan Stubbs. He survived the same condition twice, having first been diagnosed following a routine medical check when he was a Celtic player in the late 1990s.

While his thoughts naturally go out to Guiterrez, who is back in his native Argentina following emergency surgery, Stubbs has also been giving more direct assistance to a young man recovering from cancer closer to home this week.

The Easter Road boss is an advocate of keeping positive in such trying circumstances, and revealed yesterday that he has been offering help and advice to Dundee United player Jordan Moore following the Tannadice youngster’s own battle for survival.

Moore, still just 20, was told he was suffering from melanoma skin cancer during a loan spell with Dunfermline and has shown remarkable maturity and courage to fight back, mercifully being given the all-clear several months ago.

However, with mental and physical scars that would unsettle a man twice his age, it was encouraging to hear he has been benefitting from an understanding ear and some sage wisdom.

Stubbs, a close friend of United boss Jackie McNamara, said: ‘I got a phone-call from Dundee United and they have a young lad [Moore] who was diagnosed with skin cancer. I was asked to go through and speak to him.

‘From that point of view he will be fine, however he is having to deal with a lot at such a young age and being open and speaking to people can be difficult.

‘The diagnosis will take you to dark places and the mind-set will be: you think you are going to die.

‘It gives you a real vulnerability and you do think: “What if?” When you are by yourself you do think: “Is this the end?” When you feel a different pain you imagine it to be somewhere else.

‘He needs to be as positive as he can,’ added 42-year-old Stubbs, who has become an inspiration to many sportspeople after writing candidly on the topic in his autobiography, How Football Saved My Life. ‘The boy is going through a tough time at the moment and we had a chat and it was good for him psychologically just to bounce off someone and speak abut things.’

Moore, thankfully, is at the end of his journey back to full health and he continues to do admirable work in the field of raising awareness regarding the illness, belying his tender years.

However, Newcastle United stalwart Gutierrez is at the start of his own battle with cancer.

The 31-year-old fans’ favourite, who has been at St James’ Park for six years, has had his left testicle removed after the discovery of a tumour and is currently undergoing chemotherapy.

Although not acquainted with him personally, Stubbs knows the man by reputation and admires his tireless playing style and character.

And he is certain that tenacity will serve Gutierrez well as he embarks on a bid to survive an increasingly beatable illness.

‘We have made giant strides since I was diagnosed with testicular cancer,’ Stubbs continued. ‘If you are going to get cancer then testicular cancer is the one you want because of the high success rate.

‘There is a 95 per cent success rate and if anybody gave you those odds in whatever battle you were facing you would grab it with both hands.

‘Negative thoughts will go through Gutierrez’ head, but he will have the best care and he needs to stay close and have his family around him and stay strong.

‘You only have to look at other people who have gone through similar situations - there is light at the end of the tunnel. If the diagnosis is good then the outcome will be positive for him.

‘Hopefully they will have found out quick enough and it won’t be long before we see Gutierrez back on the pitch fighting fit. He looks a tough character and determined guy.

‘He is the sort of guy you can kick but will get up and keep coming back at you! If he takes that mentality with the illness I have no doubt he will beat it.’

Amid an admirably candid discussion with Stubbs, it was easy to forget that his Hibernian side have a big game this weekend as they try to keep pace with Hearts and Rangers in the bid to return to the Premiership.

Thankfully Jordon Forster was on hand to emphasise the importance - albeit one that was given a new sense of perspective by the week’s events - of their trip to face Queen of the South this afternoon.

‘We have been too easy to score against and we are working on that as a team,’ added the young defender following last week’s thrilling 3-2 win over Cowdenbeath.

‘But we are scoring goals, so you take the good with the bad and try to find the right balance.’
