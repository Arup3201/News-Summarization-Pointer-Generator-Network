Mark Kirk says three angels came to his bedside and asked him if he wanted to go to heaven, after he suffered a massive stroke that left him unable to walk.

Speaking for the first time nearly a year after the debilitating ischemic stroke, the Republican junior senator for Illinois described how the angels stood over him and asked: 'You want to come with us?' to which he responded: 'No. I'll hold off.'

Kirk, 53, recounted his harrowing journey in an in-depth interview with the Daily Herald, just days before he returned to the Senate as Congress convened today.

He's back: Republican Senator from Illinois Mark Kirk, second from left pictured with Vice President Joe Biden and Democratic Senator from West Virginia Joe Manchin, walks up the east steps of the Senate after returning to Capitol Hill

After suffering the serious brain trauma
on January 21, 2012, doctors put the senator in a coma and performed 
several surgeries, temporarily removing a 4-by-8 inch portion of skull 
to allow his brain to swell and heal.

Kirk didn't know any of this at the time, but what he did know was how close he came to death.

'A thing goes off in your head that this is the end,' he told The Herald, adding that the life-changing event has deepened his faith and dramatically changed his outlook.

'I would say that I definitely became much more religious,' Kirk said.

'They say there are no atheists in foxholes, and this stroke put me into a very deep foxhole. Yet, that feeling of faith sustained me, so I have no feelings of anger or regret.'

All smiles: Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., third from right, said he visualized returning to work while he recovered from his debilitating stroke

His left arm is slack, but Kirk 
gestures emphatically with his right hand as he describes how the 
experience made him resolve 'to never, ever give up.'

And he didn't. Today, with the help of 
some friends, Kirk climbed the 45 steps of the U.S. Capitol for the 
first time since his stroke.

Walking those stairs was something 
the senator visualized during the seemingly endless physical therapy 
sessions at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago that left him 
exhausted, sore and, sometimes, nauseated.

'I kept imagining going back to work,' Kirk told The Herald, 'and the irreducible physical amount of effort I had to put in.'

Kirk's stroke — caused by a blocked artery — occurred on the right side of his brain, which affects movement on his left side.

But his doctor, Richard Fessler, said
the senator was lucky it didn't strike on the left side as his ability 
to speak, understand and think would have been damaged.

Journey: Kirk, 53, recounted his harrowing journey in an in-depth interview with the Daily Herald, just days before he returned to the Senate as Congress convened today.

Thumbs up: Senate Minority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell of Ky. gives a thumbs-up at left, as Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., second from right, accompanied by Vice President Joe Biden, right, and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., walks up the steps to the Senate door

Kirk also had to relearn to walk, a process he describes as frustrating and exhausting. But it came with a breakthrough moment, he said.

'I
figured a way to think about it. My left leg was like a dead tuna that 
was stapled to my hip. I had to use my hip to swing forward. The day 
that I figured it out, I couldn't stop walking.'

Today, Kirk told the Herald, all of the blood clots in his body are gone, including one in his left leg that could have triggered another stroke.

Much of the remarkable recovery he attributes to his medical team.

'The
only reason I'm doing so well (is) this wasn't the first rodeo for my 
doctors and nurses,' Kirk told the Herald. 'The story of my recovery was
the story of medical professionals who didn't complicate problems.'

There are, however, some signs of the stroke that linger, leading Kirk to refer to himself as a 'disabled American.'

Trial: Kirk is taking part in an intensive walking study for stroke patients which will help him quicken his walking pace and, he hopes, enable him to climb the 45 steps to the Capitol

Praise: In the video the senator thanked the staff at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, as well as the people of Illinois for granting him the 'honour' of representing them

He now speaks clearly, but more softly, slowly and deliberately than before. His left side has suffered partial paralysis, requiring him to use a four-pronged cane, and he has limited use of his left arm.

He is also blind in one quadrant of his left eye, he told the Herald.

Kirk will rely on the help of staffers as he resumes his duties in the senate, and will live in a new, wheelchair accessible apartment on Capitol Hill. While in Washington, he will attend therapy three days a week.

But he says his renewed faith, and lease on life, will make him even more determined to succeed in his role.

'(I am determined) to just keep going, even when things feel like we're at the end here. Which is what the ICU was like for me.'
