Her own mother bucked the royal trend for traditional baby names when she opted for Zara.

So it is not surprising that new mum Zara Phillips decided against going with family favourites such as Elizabeth or Anne.

Yesterday the Queen’s grand-daughter and her husband, former England rugby captain Mike Tindall, announced they had named their daughter Mia Grace (pronounced My-ya) for no other reason than ‘they both liked the name’.

Proud: Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall have named their baby daughter Mia Grace

And they are not the only ones. Mia shot into the chart of the country’s most popular baby names at number seven last year, with 3,524 new Mias in the country.

In marked difference from last week’s formal Buckingham Palace announcement of her birth, the news was announced by Tindall on Twitter.

He posted: ‘For everyone who has asked what our daughter’s name, it’s Mia Grace Tindall.’

Zara’s spokesman, Susan MacMahon, told the Mail: ‘There is no family connection, no relation with the name, it’s just pure coincidence. They both just really liked the names, particularly Mia.’

Bookmakers William Hill dropped its 
odds on the name from 16/1 to 5/1 after a surge of bets in the  minutes 
before the announcement. ‘There was a late surge of betting for “Mia”, 
with one punter wanting £300 on the name,’ spokesman  Jon Ivan-Duke 
said.

‘Normally the money 
that comes  in on royal baby names tends to be quite small. Ten or 
twenty pounds . .. a little here, a little there. So when someone 
attempts to put a relatively large amount on all of a sudden,  it tends 
to arouse our suspicions.

‘We
 decided not to take the bet and do a little checking to see if the 
information was out there, and as we were checking the information came 
in.’

Mia is of both 
Italian and Latin origin and means ‘mine’. In  Danish, it means 
‘beloved’.

Grace is a more traditional name, which has long been used to represent the concept of divine grace.

In a royal context, it was made famous 
by Princess Grace of Monaco, the Hollywood actress who married Prince 
Rainier and was considered a global icon of style and glamour.

Birth: Zara, pictured shortly before the birth of Mia, left hospital just six hours after the baby was born

Zara gave birth last week to the 7lb 12oz girl, who is 16th in line to the throne and is the Queen's fourth great-grandchild.

Tindall
 also took to Twitter after the birth to describe his joy at becoming a 
father for the first time, saying it was 'definitely the best day of my 
life'.

However, the couple predicted they 
would take some time to come up with a name because they had chosen not 
to be told the sex of their child in advance.

Zara,
 a silver medal-winning Olympian who is one of Britain's leading 
equestrian riders, gave birth to her first child at Gloucestershire 
Royal Hospital with her husband at her side.

She
 is the daughter of Princess Anne, but does not hold a royal title after
 her mother decided not to pass on her status to her children.

Mia Grace will also not hold any royal or aristocratic title.

When Zara herself was born, her name was likewise a break from tradition as it had no precedent in the royal family.

With
 a wide circle of friends and family that includes an eclectic mix of 
royalty, rugby players and racing folk, there’s no shortage of 
candidates for the role of Mia's godparent.

The Duke and 
Duchess of Cambridge are both possible options as is Prince Harry, 
because Zara is known to be close to her cousins and is godmother to 
Prince George.

Another 
royal who could be asked is Zara’s brother Peter Phillips or his wife 
Autumn Kelly, and other Windsors such as Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie
 are also in the frame.

Zara’s
 best friend, racehorse trainer, Dolly Maude, is a likely choice - Zara 
is already godmother to her seven-year-old son Ted Maude.

Ms
 Maude was also a maid of honour at Zara’s 2011 wedding to Mike Tindall,
 where she shared the honours with Stephanie Phillips, Zara’s 
15-year-old half-sister and another potential godparent.

The use of Twitter to announce the 
name of the baby stands in stark contrast to how the birth of her second
 cousin Prince George was revealed to the world.

When
 the son of Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge was born last 
year, the official announcement of the birth came on an easel placed 
outside Buckingham Palace.

Zara
 has said that she plans to return to riding as soon as possible 
following Mia's birth - just like Anne, who did not allow becoming a 
mother to interrupt her sporting career.

In
 an early sign of her no-nonsense approach to motherhood, Zara left 
hospital last week after just six hours and returned to the Gatcombe 
Park estate in Gloucestershire, where she was joined by Anne and by her 
brother Peter.

The early betting was on a more 
traditional name for the new royal baby with Charlotte, Victoria, Anne 
and Elizabeth among the front runners.

But bookmakers William Hill said Mia entered the betting yesterday afternoon at odds of 16-1 and finished as the 5-1 favourite.

Spokesman
 Rupert Adams said: 'It looks like a few people managed to get Mia 
correct and we have now lost for the second time running.

'We might have to close that betting early for the next royal baby - be it William or Harry.'

The baby girl follows Zara's brother Peter Phillips' two children and Prince George to become the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh's fourth great grandchild.

Peter Phillips' daughters Savannah and Isla Phillips were also born at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital in Gloucester.

Zara and Mr Tindall moved back to Anne's Gatcombe Park estate last January after selling their regency home in Cheltenham.

The pair first met in a Sydney bar when Mr Tindall was in Australia for the 2003 Rugby World Cup.

They married in July 2011 in a ceremony staged in Edinburgh and attended by the Queen and senior royals.

Zara won a silver medal at London 2012 with eventing equestrian teammates William Fox-Pitt, Mary King, Tina Cook and Nicola Wilson, and is planning to take part in the Rio de Janeiro Games in 2016.
