The bread and butter of Twitter is getting more followers, but to get more followers you ultimately need to get more retweets.

A new study has looked into the science behind what makes a tweet popular and therefore more likely to be shared, and has discovered it may be as simple as just adding a photo.

Dan Zarrella, HubSpot's social-media scientist, discovered that tweets including photos, and in particular photos hosted by Twitter's own picture service, are 94 per cent more likely to be shared.

The study looked at 400,000 tweets and compared their retweet rates. It discovered tweets including photos, and in particular photos hosted by Twitter's own picture service, are 94 per cent more likely to be shared, left. Tweets with Instagram photos attached had a negative effect and were 42 per cent less likely to be retweeted

At the other end of the scale, tweets that include links to Instagram pictures are 42 per cent less likely to be retweeted.

Zarella studied 400,000 randomly selected tweets and compared their retweet rates.

After discovering that photo tweets received more retweets on average than tweets only containing text, Zarella compared where each of these photos were hosted.

Every time a photo is posted online, the original image is hosted on a particular service which then creates a clickable link.

This makes it possible to share images without having to send the original files.

Zarella looked at photos tweeted using Twitpic, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter's own picture service, pic.Twitter.

Instagram was 64 per cent less likely to be shared, while Facebook was 47 per cent. Twitpic came out in second place with a retweet rate 64 per cent more likely.

Zarella said: 'Using a dataset of 482,865 randomly selected tweets, I found that using Twitter's native image uploading system greatly improved the odds of a tweet being retweeted.

'Twitpic had a less powerful, but still positive effect, while Facebook and Instagram image links had negative effects.'

Zarrella is an author of four books including The Science of Marketing, Zarrellaâ€™s Hierarchy of Contagiousness, The Social Media Marketing Book and The Facebook Marketing Book.
