Chris Brown has posted a picture of a nasty gash on his chin - apparently sustained from a nightclub  brawl with rapper Drake and his entourage in New York. 

Brown allegedly flew into a rage after Drake taunted him by returning a bottle of champagne he'd sent over as 'peace offering' with a note reading:  'I'm f****** the love of your life, deal with it'.

Drakes crude response was clearly a reference to Brown's ex-girlfriend Rihanna.

According to website Global Grind Chris reportedly flew into a rage and confronted Drake.

Drake allegedly threw a punch but before the singer could retaliate, another man hit Brown in the face with a bottle.

A source told the New York Post: 'They were on opposite sides of the room, Drake went over to the middle of the club to talk to someone, then words were exchanged with Chris and his entourage.

The source said someone from Drake's entourage, possibly the singer himself, threw a bottle.

'Once the bottle was thrown, all hell broke loose and there were more bottles thrown.'

The fight allegedly kicked off as the last song was playing, just before 4 a.m.

Police were 
already at the scene because it was closing time and that they 'were on 
it in seconds and began getting everyone out of the club.'

Pictures of the aftermath show the club floor strewn with broken glass.

Brown was pulled out of the situation by his own security and helped out of the club while Drake was pulled to the back of the club, the source said. '[Drake] was one of the last out of W.I.P.'

Drake
has today denied he was involved in 'any kind last night at W.i.P.' His
spokeswoman said in a statement: 'He was on his way out of the club

The fight will further fuel rumours regarding the closeness of Rihanna to her ex Brown.

Earlier this week the
two pop superstars partied at the same club at the same time for the 
second time in as many days, leaving within minutes of each other.

TMZ reported the pair 
were in the club together for around 30 minutes and Brown spent some 
time with the Rude Girl singer at her table.

Sitting
in different booths, the couple still 'kept a close eye on each other' -
and Brown sent her over two bottles of Ace of Spades Champagne.

A video surfaced earlier this week of the pair leaving the club minutes apart.

The lovelorn pair have been linked 
together several times already this year, after it emerged that they had
recorded songs with each.

And of late wherever Rihanna is, 
Brown isn't far behind, as they party at birthday celebrations and 
nightclubs in West Hollywood.

The sighting comes after another sign
that Rihanna is paving the way for a reconciliation with singer Chris ,
as the raunchy singer reportedly invited the singer to attend a 
basketball game party on Saturday with her family.

The singer and Brown joined her family - including grandfather Lionel Braithwaite on Saturday at an intimate gathering at Jay-Z's New York club 40/40 to watch the Miami Heat beat the Boston Celtics.

A source told The New York Post: 'Rihanna arrives first in a yellow cab, with her family and friends, and was escorted to a private room.

'Brown arrived a little later and joined her and her family.'

The pair have been spotted together often in recent weeks 

Full footage will be released on WeMobbinDVD'
