Free wi-fi access will be available to rail passengers across England and Wales within two years, David Cameron announced yesterday.

He said it was 'vital' that commuters could work online while travelling after warnings that too many operators are 'stuck in the analogue age'. A major extension of on-board wireless internet connections is set to be rolled out to most lines by 2017.

Whitehall will release £50million towards the cost of the project – with the money coming from the huge fine paid by rail bosses for delays to services.

Prime Minister David Cameron, working on a train last week, said it was 'vital' for people to be able to get online while travelling

The cash will benefit travellers with operators that offer either no or limited wi-fi including Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern, Southeastern, Chiltern and Arriva Trains Wales. Firms that do offer wi-fi but charge for it will have to set out how they would provide the service for free when they renew franchises – a move that could save commuters up to £360 a year.

Rail minister Claire Perry said yesterday: 'Free wi-fi is a priority for many as being able to keep up with work, connect with friends or even check the latest journey information online helps make rail travel more productive.'

Mr Cameron announced the proposals after being asked by MP Maria Miller at Prime Minister's Questions what he would do for commuters 'increasingly frustrated that our trains are stuck in the analogue age' with internet access 'difficult and very limited'.

The Prime Minister said: 'It is vital for businesses and for individuals to be able to access wi-fi, do their work and make other contacts while they are on trains.

'I am pleased to announce plans that will see the rollout of free Wi-Fi on trains across the UK from 2017.' 

He said: 'The Government will invest nearly £50 million to ensure that rail passengers are better connected.

'Passengers that make over 500 million journeys every year with the four rail operators, TSGN, Southeastern, Chiltern, Arriva Trains Wales, will all benefit from this investment.'

Chiltern trains are among those set to benefit from the investment announced today

Mr Cameron made the announcement in response to a question from former culture secretary Maria Miller, who said passengers were 'increasingly frustrated our trains are stuck in the analogue age'.

Of the operators that provide the service, East Coast trains offers 15 minutes for free, and then charges £4.95 an hour or £9.95 for 24 hours. East Midlands Trains charges £4 a journey or £300 a year for regular commuters.

Virgin Trains charges £4 an hour, or up to £30 a month – equal to £360 for a year.

Under the new plans, the 20 per cent of services with wi-fi will rise to about 70 per cent by 2017.

The cost will come from the £53.1million fine that the Office for Rail Regulation ordered Network Rail to pay last year for missing punctuality targets.

Cash will go towards the track-side cables and transmitters needed to provide wi-fi. 

David Sidebottom, of the watchdog Passenger Focus, said: 'Passengers expect to be able to use free and reliable wi-fi... and they have told us that this is a top priority for improving their journey.'

The Department for Transport said: 'Where there is no new franchise agreement due in the next two years, almost £50million of funding will be released from the Department for Transport to ensure Wi-Fi is available on selected services from 2017'. 

It added: 'Some operators have already installed equipment to provide improved mobile coverage on-board their trains, or are in the process of doing so. 

'By targeting the investment at franchises that would otherwise have no immediate plans to introduce Wi-Fi, the government is ensuring that as many passengers as possible benefit.'

Travellers on Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern, Southeastern, Chiltern and Arriva Trains Wales services should be able to access free wi-fi from 2017

The £47.8million funding is money that Network Rail has been required to return to the government for missing punctuality targets set by the watchdog Office of Rail Regulation.

It is the first time such money has been reinvested into improvements targeted at passengers, said the Department for Transport. 

But Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union questioned why taxpayers' cash was being used to fund the wi-fi: 'You don't get the taxpayer funding free wi-fi in Starbucks or Costa Coffee. The rail companies should be paying for it out of their profits.' 

He added; At least passengers will be able to surf the net to find out why the train they are on is running late or overcrowded' 

Of the £53.1 million total penalty against Network Rail, some £5.3 million has been allocated to the Scottish Government, in line with the proportion of the penalty paid by Network Rail for late trains running in Scotland.

Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: 'As someone who regularly travels from the North of Scotland around the country, I appreciate the value of fast, cheap internet connections on trains for both leisure and business travellers. '  

A spokesman for the Rail Delivery Group, which represents Network Rail and train operators, said: 'It is good news that even more rail passengers will be able to benefit from Wi-Fi on their train.

'Rail plays a crucial role in keeping people connected to friends, family and jobs and the wider rollout of Wi-Fi on the rail network will mean people can make even better use of their time on the train.'
