The beautiful marketing executive thrust into the spotlight by the Manti Te'o fake girlfriend hoax says she didn't know who he was until she became the face of his tragic love - who never existed.

Diane O'Meara, 23, was unknowingly used as the face of Lennay Kekua for months as the Notre Dame football star told and re-told the story about how he excelled on the field despite the personal tragedy of Kekua's death.

Pictures that Miss O'Meara had posted on Facebook and Instagram were used in the elaborate hoax, which she says is a case of identity theft.

Shock: Diane O'Meara could not believe it when she found out she was the face of Lennay Kekua

Apology: While Tuiasosopo has since called her and expressed regret over the situation she was thrown into, Miss O'Meara says there's little he can do to make it better.

Duped: Miss O'Meara says she's never met Manti Te'o, never spoken with him and has never exchanged words or tweets with him

She says the images were used to create 
the Lennay Kekua online persona by alleged mastermind Ronaiah Tuiasosopo, an 
aspiring musician and son of a California pastor.

In an interview with NBC News airing today, Miss O'Meara said: 'I've never met Manti Te'o in my entire life. I’ve never spoken with him. I've never exchanged words, tweets.'

She added: 'It's very bizarre and it's a very twisted and confusing scenario.'

It wasn't until she was contacted by a Deadspin.com reporter investigating Kekua that she found out the truth.

She told NBC News: 'In the past five years, [Tuiasosopo has] literally been stalking my facebook and stealing my photos.'

While Tuiasosopo has since called her and expressed regret over the situation she was thrown into, Miss O'Meara says there's little he can do to make it better.

Mistaken identity: Miss O'Meara says that Ronaiah Tuiasosopo 'stalked' her Facebook for years and stole her photos to post under Kekua's name

Going public: Miss O'Meara calls the scandal 'twisted and confusing'

Fake and original: The picture used by the hoaxers as the face of Lennay Kekua, left, was taken from this original photograph of Diane O'Meara, 23, a marketing executive living in Los Angeles

Fake: The Twitter account of Lennay Kekua with Diane's pictures has been exposed as completely false

She told the network: 'Ronaiah
has called and I know he has confessed but he has also apologized. But I
don't think there’s anything he can say to me that would fix this.'

In another twist, O’Meara was drawn into the scam despite saying she has 'strong experience' with Internet advertising and is professionally competent with social media.

That somebody whose job involves such work on the Internet could be so completely duped illustrates the chilling ease with which the entire scam has been carried out.

Speaking to the New York Post last week, O'Meara's relatives told of their horror at what had happened.

Olga Volkov said that O’Meara was a 'good person' from a 'good family.'

Innocent: Diane was apparently unsuspecting of the scam - and was 'shocked' to find her face as that of Lennay

Inspiration: Te'o used the memory of Lennay Kekua to drove him to victory and create a myth that captivated the nation but any role he may have had in the hoax is now questioned

Te'o's tragic story about his girlfriend won his a groundswell of public support last September as Notre Dame was heading into crunch games for the BCS championships. 

Kekua supposedly died around September 12 from leukemia after recovering from a near fatal car crash - just six hours after his grandmother passed away.

Among those that paid tribute to Kekua was CBS which showed a picture of her on This Morning with a direct quote she has supposedly said to Te'o: ‘Babe, if anything happens to me, you promise that you'll stay there and you'll play and you'll honor me through the way you play.'

Next to the quote was O'Meara's picture.

When Deadspin contacted O’Meara she said: 'That picture is a picture of me from my Facebook account.'

All the other photos used on Kekua's 
Twitter account came from the private Facebook and Instagram accounts 
belonging to O'Meara, apart from one, which she unwittingly sent to 
former high-school classmate Tuiasosopo.

Shocked: Friends of O'Meara say she only found out yesterday she was the most famous woman in America right now

According to Deadspin, Tuiasosopo got in touch with her out of the blue some time ago with a rather convoluted story.

He
said his cousin had been hurt in a car crash and that he wanted to get 
her show support by sending her pictures of people he knew holding up a 
sign saying 'MSMK,' which he planned to show her as a slide show.

O’Meara obliged - only to later find the picture on Kekua's @Love MSMK Twitter profile.

O’Meara's Internet profiles suggest 
that she is a world removed from the lying and scheming that was 
involved in pulling off this elaborate plot.

Photos on her social media profiles show her relaxing with friends, out partying and sitting on the beach in a bikini.

Memories: A picture of Kekua, now known to be Diane, was shown on CBS during an interview with Te'o, when he talked about her 'death'

On her Twitter page she writes that she is: ‘The most driven person you'll meet, literally. Diaries of a commuting queen’

O’Meara attended California State University at Long Beach and graduated in 2011 with a BS in Business Administration and Business.

She now works for STN Media Group in Los Angeles and lives in the Torrance neighbourhood.

Her LinkedIn profile says she has strong experience at 'event planning; fashion retail management; and professional/government office experience.'

She also says she is 'competent in web design and maintenance' including 'e-mail marketing, social media, and blogs.'
