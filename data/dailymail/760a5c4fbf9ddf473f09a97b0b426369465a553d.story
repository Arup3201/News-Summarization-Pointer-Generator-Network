The coach of the Canadian women’s soccer team stoked tensions with the U.S. squad just before their semifinal match today, taking a jab at the Americans for what he calls 'highly illegal' tactics. 

John Herdman accused Team USA of breaking the rules with their physical play on set pieces.

Herdman said yesterday: 'One of the big threats we've got to take care of, and what we've paid attention to, is the illegal marking in the box on their corners and free kicks.'

'Some of the blocking tactics, which are highly illegal, we'll keep an eye on them in the game. We've starting working on that in training without trying to injure our players.'

Herdman said he also hopes to 'raise awareness' of the issue with game officials when Canada plays the U.S. in the semifinals today at Old Trafford.

'Obviously they're trying to free up a key player, but in a very illegal way... The U.S., it's what they do well,' he said.

Herdman cited an example from the Americans' victory over France in the Olympic opener, when forward Abby Wambach headed in a corner kick in the first half.

Few successes: Canada is winless in its last 26 matches against its rivals to the south, going 0-22-4 since a win at the Algarve Cup in 2001

He said U.S. defender Amy LePeilbet 'took a good battering' while making a move that freed up Wambach.

Canada is winless in its last 26 matches against its rivals to the south, going 0-22-4 since a win at the Algarve Cup in 2001. 

The all-time series tilts 43-3-5 in favour of the Americans.

Nonetheless, the U.S. will not be taking its previous successes for granted.

Team USA’s head coach Pia Sundhage told the San Jose Mercury News:  'The fact that [the U.S.] has been so successful means we are able to cope with the pressure and expectation and use it in a positive way.'

Wambach added: 'Canada has always been a dogfight for some reason.

'We've had historically close matches 
and because of the physical nature of the play, the result has often 
been a lot closer than we would have liked.'

The U.S. has won the last two Olympic gold medals, while a win today would guarantee Canada's first Summer Games medal in a traditional team sport - not counting rowing or equestrian - since a men's basketball silver in 1936.

Herdman said: 'The Olympics is all about people trying to set personal bests and breaking world records, and I think for this group of players, that's what they're dreaming about.'

'I think the Olympics is one of those special occasions where things do happen, especially in these tournament formats... This is what we're trying to say, you know: 'Dare to dream.' You've got to be able to get out there and see something, see a bigger vision than normal people can see.'

It's not the first time the U.S. has been accused of playing dirty during the London games.

Colombian soccer player Lady Andrade, who was suspended after 'sucker punching' Wambach, said that it was the Americans who struck first.

'The whistle always goes in their favor,' she insisted. 'They were hitting us and hitting us, but there was never a whistle.'
