Most of us are guilty of zoning out as the cabin crew point out the emergency exits before our flight takes off. So what’s the best way to grab our attention during the obligatory safety instructions?

How about performing the splits in mid-air?

One flight attendant made sure his enthusiastic demonstration on a recent Virgin America flight was impossible for passengers to ignore.

Jive talking: The air steward demonstrates how to fasten the seat belt and operate the oxygen mask while gyrating his hips and shimmying up and down the aisles

Taking tips from the airline’s recent promotional film that uses dance routines and music to illustrate its pre-flight safety instructions, air steward Michael Tongko is seen running up and down the aisle and gyrating his hips to music.

Several of the passengers look rather nonplussed at first, continuing to read or sip their drinks as the man jumps up and down beside them.

But Mr Tongko perseveres, demonstrating how 
to fasten the seat belt and operate the oxygen mask while shimmying back
 and forth, waving his arms in the air. 

Runway hit: The flight attendant makes sure he gets everyone's attention with a series of dramatic moves, including a high kick to the cabin ceiling and mid-air splits

He then grabs a life jacket and dramatically drops to the floor to laughter in the cabin.

Clearly enjoying himself, he proceeds to point out the exits, striding up and down the cabin as if auditioning for a part in a Broadway musical.

He dramatically rounds off this 
segment of the demonstration with a high kick to the cabin ceiling to 
cries of ‘Nice!’ from the passengers.

Grinning
 widely, he runs back down the cabin, arms outstretched, before 
returning to first class to perform his impressive finale - the splits 
in mid-air - to whoops and applause from the passengers.

The routine was captured by passenger Zac Bowling from San Francisco who filmed Mr Tongko's exhausting dance moves on a flight from Las
 Vegas to San Francisco

A video of Michael 
performing a similar routine was also filmed on a flight from San Francisco to Seattle.

He has clearly been putting his hobby to good use - the air steward is a figure skater in his spare time.

Commenting on Virgin America's website he said: 'Zac's video of my Demo made it onto the Homepage of the Virgin.com website! YAY!!!! Still so humbled and excited to get all this positive feedback!'

New routine: The flight attendant's moves mimic Virgin America's promotional video in which performers dance along to the safety instructions

The flight attendant’s snazzy moves mimic the airline’s recent promotional video in which dancers and former American Idol contestants sing, rap and dance along to the safety instructions.

The video uses 14 different dance styles to spell out the pre-flight instructions and features singing air hostesses and dancing nuns.

One air hostess says: 'For the .001% of you who have never operated a seat belt before - really?' 

A new habit: The five-minute video by filmmaker Jon Chu even features dancing nuns

The video was created by filmmaker Jon Chu who worked on Step Up 2, Step Up 3,  Justin Bieber's 3D concert film Never Say Never and G.I. Joe: Retaliation.

'The most important aspect of any safety video is that people actually pay attention to it. Too often the dry, perfunctory safety messaging used in the past was tuned out', said Mr Chu.

The FAA has a regulation dictating what has to be included in safety presentations.

'We don't care how you deliver it, as long as it's imparted to passengers,' said FAA spokeswoman Alison Duquette.
