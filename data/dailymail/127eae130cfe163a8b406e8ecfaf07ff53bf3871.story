Lava from a volcano on Hawaii's Big Island is on course to reach a shopping center with a gas station and a supermarket in seven to 10 days, officials said.

Lava is about 1 mile from the shopping center in the small town of Pahoa, Hawaii County Civil Defense Director Darryl Oliveira said Monday. 

The shopping center also contains a hardware store, pharmacy and auto repair shop.

There's still a great deal of uncertainty about when the lava might reach the center and what it could hit. The lava could smother one structure in the complex or cover them all, he said.

Creeping along:  The active lava flow front, seen in this Friday photogrpah,  continues to advance downslope towards the northeast about a mile and a half from the marketplace in Pahoa, Hawaii

Pathway: A stalled lobe of the June 27 lava flow which came within feet of the transfer station in Pahoa, Hawaii is seen last Monday 

'It just depends on what the flow does as it comes through,' he told reporters during a conference call.

Oliveira says the county has been in touch with the merchants about evacuation plans. The county hasn't yet advised them to leave.

The supermarket, one of the biggest stores in the center, plans to start removing equipment on Tuesday and shut down on Thursday. Malama Market said in a statement it was encouraging customers to keep shopping until its doors close.

Sheryl Toda, a spokesperson for the Sullivan Family of Companies told The Star-Advertiser 'Our employees are our top priorities and right now we're looking into various options on how to help them through the transition.' 

83 people work at the store, the newspaper reported.

'It just seems to move fast, then slow down, move fast, then slow down again,' Supercuts manager Duchess Kama told The Star-Advertiser. 'We're more anxious because it's getting closer, and it's the unknown part — that's what makes you anxious.' 

The gas station would sell its remaining fuel and pump out what's leftover if it does have to evacuate, Oliveira said. It would then fill its tanks with water and firefighting foam.

Crossing:  Frank Trusdell of the U.S. Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory walks across a section of the June 27 lava flow that crossed Cemetery Road in Pahoa, Hawaii last Monday

This plan has been approved the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and by the state Department of Health, he said.

An earlier idea called for the gas station to put sand into the tanks, but this wouldn't have removed all flammable vapors. It also would have destroyed the pumping system. By using firefighting foam, the gas station may use the tanks again if lava bypasses the area and it wants to reopen.

Lava has never hit a gas station on the Big Island in the past, Oliveira said.

Lava from Kilauea volcano has been threatening Pahoa town, which has a population of about 900, for months. In October, it burned a house and covered part of a cemetery but stalled just before hitting Pahoa's main road.

It later started flowing from a different spot.

The lava could still cross the town's main road and a highway, which would make it more difficult for residents of Pahoa and the broader community of Puna to get to other parts of the island. 

Two brothers who run an auto shop in Pahoa, Brady and Myke Metcalf, have taken to selling t-shirts with the words '2014 Go With the Flow Tour,'The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reported.

'The picture of the lava, this isn’t us wishing for this to happen, It's a cartoon,' Brady Metcalf told the newspaper.

Myke Metcalf told The Hawaii Tribune-Herald more than 500 shirts have been purchased.

Defense: A geologist uses a handheld GPS unit to mark the lava flow margin coordinates in Pahoa on Friday. Officials say lava from Kilauea volcano is on course to reach a shopping center   in seven to ten days
