Angry: Teacher Katharine Birbalsingh, has said she will no longer be voting for the Conservatives following Michael Gove's sacking

Michael Gove’s sacking risks ‘killing the goose that laid the golden eggs’ of school reform, one of his allies warned last night.

A teacher who lost her job after giving a speech to the Conservative Party conference in which she condemned the standard of state education said she would withdraw her support for the Tories.

‘I never thought much of Cameron and now I think even less of him,’ said Katharine Birbalsingh, who is opening a free school in London. ‘There goes my vote for the Conservatives.’

The Tory Right has reacted angrily to Mr Gove being moved to Chief Whip in Tuesday’s reshuffle.

David Cameron told MPs he needed ‘the very best candidate’ to replace Sir George Young, who has stepped down from the Cabinet.

‘Let me tell you what the former education secretary achieved,’ said the Prime Minister. ‘A record number of academies, new free schools, standards rising across the country, and reforms that will endure.’

Government sources insisted that new Education Secretary Nicky Morgan will ‘100 per cent’ push ahead with Mr Gove’s plans to shake up schools, the curriculum and exams.

Veteran Cabinet minister Kenneth Clarke, who also left the Government this week, said he had been ‘as surprised as everybody else’ by Mr Gove’s move from education.

He told the BBC’s Daily Politics programme be believed the Prime Minister wanted to ‘quieten the subject down’ in the nine months before the general election.

He compared the move to his own shift from health to education by Margaret Thatcher in her final Cabinet reshuffle after he clashed with the medical establishment. ‘Her intention was to quieten it down before the election,’ he added.

Today’s Spectator magazine claims Mr Cameron had been mulling a move for Mr Gove since late last year. Chief election strategist Lynton Crosby is understood to have warned the Prime Minister that Mr Gove had become ‘toxic’, with his unpopularity spreading beyond the teaching profession.

An Ipsos MORI poll yesterday confirmed that Mr Gove had become one of Britain’s least popular politicians, liked by just 22 per cent of the public and disliked by 54 per cent.

Mr Cameron had also become ‘incensed’ by Mr Gove’s tendency to become embroiled in public arguments with colleagues, most notably Home Secretary Theresa May.

Mr Gove is understood to have been reluctant to move, and it took ‘a lot of time and persuasion’ to make him accept the shift to the whips’ office, where he will be in charge of party discipline. It means a downgrading of his status as a full member of the Cabinet and a pay cut of almost £40,000 a year.

Miss Birbalsingh said that with Mr Gove in post, ‘for once in our history, Britain had a government that took education seriously’. She branded Mr Cameron ‘the man who killed the goose that laid the golden eggs’.

‘Education isn’t important enough to the people for governments to care enough to take a principled stance. Freedom from government is what schools need,’ she said.

Her free school will be outside local authority control.

Author and commentator Toby Young, who has set up a free school in London, said Mr Gove had been ‘the most radical education secretary of the past 50 years’.

‘The problem he’s always faced, from a political point of view, is that it will take decades before any of his reforms begin to bear fruit,’ he added. ‘That means he hasn’t been able to respond to his critics by pointing to the positive impact his policies have had, unlike George Osborne.’
