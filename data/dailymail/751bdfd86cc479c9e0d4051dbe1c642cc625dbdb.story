Animal advocates are fighting save the life of a German shepherd after his owner demanded in her will that he be euthanized and buried with her after her death last month. 

Connie Lay, of Aurora, Indiana, decreed before her death that her beloved dog Bela should be put down, cremated and his ashes mixed with hers.

Her attorney says that Bela is Lay's property and that she is free to do with him what she wishes. 

Volunteers at the PAWS Humane Center, which is boarding Bela until his fate is sealed, say that he is a sweet, healthy dog who should be adopted out to a new home. 

Cruel fate: Bela is due to be euthanized after his owner stipulated that he should be with her for eternity after her death last month

Numerous families have come forward and asked to adopt him - but Ms Lay's lawyer says that the dog is her property and she gets to decide what happens to him. 

'The dog was owned by my client and now it’s part of her estate,' Doug Denmure told WCPO-TV. 

'And those are her wishes, as far as the future of the dog is concerned. Outsiders don’t have the grounds to rewrite the provisions of my client’s will and impose what they want.'

Under Indiana law, pets and other animals are considered property. Owners must treat them humanely, but otherwise get allowed to decide whether they live or die. 

Lay died on November 25 - but before her death she made arrangements with her lawyer and a close friend to 'dispose' of all her property  - including Bela. 

Mr Denmure told WCPO that the dog is aggressive and that Ms Lay kept a record of his aggressive behavior before she died. 

Bela is currently being boarded at the PAWS Humane Center while he awaits his fate. Several families have offered to adopt him

When she passed away at her home, Bela fiercely guarded her body and would not let anyone enter the house. 

However, volunteers who have worked with Bela since he was taken to the shelter say that he hasn't shown signs of being overly aggressive, according to WXIX-TV. 

There is one other provision that Ms Lay made in her will for Bela. He could be sent to a no-kill animal refuge in southern Utah. 

However, Mr Denmure says she didn't leave behind enough money to send Bela to the shelter, called Best Friends Animal Society. 

Mr Denmure said he's currently accepting donations from anyone who wants to contribute to a fund to transport the pooch to Utah.

It is unknown much long Bela has before he will be euthanized.
