At first glance the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge seemed uncharacteristically serious as they took in a dance performance by a charity group in London today.

But the young couple were soon struggling to keep their royal compusure as a male dancer took to the stage shaking his hips in a style similar to the 'twerk' made famous by singer Miley Cyrus.

Kate and William were on a visit to the Only Connect charity which supports ex-offenders and young people at risk of offending.

After touring the offices the pair were treated to 
contemporary dance performances by the group Dance United and had the 
opportunity to meet those connected to the charity, including ex-offender Mr 
Russell-Andrews and his daughter.

During a visit to the Only Connect charity in London on Tuesday the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were treated to a contemporary dance performance by the group Dance United

The couple seemed relaxed and happy as they took in the show, including a 'twerk' style routine by a male dancer

Impressed: The Duke of Cambridge appeared serious throughout the show but later spoke of his admiration for the dancers

During
 the visit, the Duchess of Cambridge spoke of her baby son Prince 
George, and revealed that the youngster is growing up fast as she accepted 
the gift of a personalised babygro from Mr Russell-Andrews.

His 
daughter, 20-month-old Teegan, tried to take the present back from Kate -
 after which she sympathised with Mr Russell-Andrews about how demanding
 babies can be.

Mr
 Russell-Andrews, 22, from Camden, north London, became involved with 
Only Connect four years ago after committing a crime a day as a teenager
 - including robbery, burglary and vehicle theft - and is now a 
professional actor.

He 
said: 'She was very pleased that Only Connect has helped me make such a 
big change with my life and keep me on the right path.

Gift: Mr Russell-Andrews and his baby daughter Teegan present the Duchess with a babygro for Prince George

Delighted: The Duchess beams as Mr Russell-Andrew unfolds the tiny black and white garment for her to see

After the performance the Duchess chatted to one of the dancers about the company which uses the power of dance to help people who are excluded and vulnerable

Helping hand: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited Only Connect Head Office to learn how they support ex-offenders and young people at risk of offending

Gifted: During the visit, the Duchess of Cambridge spoke of her baby son Prince George, and revealed that the youngster is growing up fast

Tucking in: Kate tried two pieces of their cakes herself, one an iced ginger sponge and the other a chocolate cake

Asked what Kate thought of the white 
babygro, which featured the Only Connect logo and the words Prince 
George underneath, Mr Russell-Andrews said: 'She was very pleased about 
it. She said it's a very good fit because he's growing very fast, and 
that he'll like it. Teegan tried to take back the babygro, she's very 
cheeky.'

He added: 'Kate 
said: "They're very demanding at this age".' While Teegan was all smiles
 with Kate, she burst into tears when William started speaking to her 
father - but she was soon placated with a piece of chocolate cake made 
by trainees from Switchback, which aims for rehabilitation through 
catering.

Glowing: Kate looked happy and healthy with her signature rose pink blushed cheeks

Autumnal: Kate looked radiant as the sun shone down on her during her visit

Kate tried two pieces of their cakes herself, one an iced ginger sponge and the other a chocolate cake.

Kate, who is famous for her penchant for recycling outfits wore a patterned Orla Kiely coat-dress that she has been spotted in before.

The
 new mother looked fresh-faced and seemed in good spirits as she arrived
 on the arm of her husband, the Duke of Cambridge, to be greeted by 
cheering crowds on Pentonville Road.

But while the Duchess appeared as youthful as ever, her brown patterned Orla Kiely dress was of an older vintage.

Something old: Bought in a sale for £162.50 - reduced from £325 - the brown and cream frock made its first appearance during a visit to a school art class in Oxford in February 2012

Thrifty: The Duchess' Orla Kiely dress first appeared during a visit to a school in Oxford

Looking good: The Duchess was stylish in her Orla Kiely shirt-dress, brown suede boots and chic black clutch

Bought in a sale for £162.50 - reduced from £325 - the brown and cream frock made its first appearance during a visit to a school art class in Oxford in February 2012.

Although the dress didn't quite escape unscathed from that engagement and ended up splattered with paint, it looked good as new as the Duchess mingled with crowds outside Only Connect's Pentonville Road headquarters.

And the dress wasn't the only part of her outfit making a repeat appearance: her brown suede ankle boots and black clutch were also on their second outing.

Both appeared with the dress during 
the Oxford visit, during which the Duchess met children helped by the 
charity The Art Room, of which she is a patron. 

Friendly: The Duchess enjoys a chat with Elise Johnson and Nasser Massadimi during a sewing class

William's
 aunt Lady Jane Fellowes, the older sister of Diana, Princess of Wales, 
is a trustee of Only Connect and described them as carrying out 'inspiring and life-changing work' in a recent interview.

A Kensington Palace spokeswoman said 
it was a coincidence that she is involved however and that the duke and 
duchess wanted to see the work of the charity as part of their interest 
in young people, describing it as a 'learning and scoping exercise'.

Speaking
 after their visit, Lady Jane said: 'I'm really delighted that William 
and Catherine have had the opportunity to see the work of Only Connect, a
 charity that I have been supporting for many years.'

Booted up: Kate accessorised her outfit with chunky brown boots and a tiny clutch bag

Glowing: It seems Kate may have had a very subtle dye applied, as her hair appears darker

Elegant: Kate on November 7, meeting military supporters and servicemen as part of London Poppy Day, with those silver strands on show 

Business: The royal couple appeared relaxed - despite the watching press pack - as they arrived at the charity

Stylish: The Duchess made her recycled outfit look good as new during the appearance in London

During the visit, William chatted to dancers Moshood Ibrahim, 20, and Jannick Moth, 22, from 
Dance United and asked them if there had been a technical glitch - 
having noticed that music for their modern dance piece only kicked in 
half-way through.

William said to them: 'I could hear clattering going on behind me. So there was a problem? I loved how you guys just rolled with it.'

Karis
 Barnard, centre manager at OC Central, spoke to the duchess about 
programmes the charity runs to help young people, which also reaches out
 to them through the arts, including poetry.She said: 'She said 
she wasn't so good at poetry but her photography is her passion. If 
she's going to do anything artistic, it's that.'

Charity visit: The Duchess of Cambridge emerges from her car before heading into the Only Connect offices

During the 
visit, the royal couple watched workshops being carried out by 
complementary projects Handmade Alliance, which trains prisoners to 
produce textiles for British designers, and Bounce Back, which offers 
training and employment in painting and decorating for offenders at the 
end of their sentences.

Kate watched volunteers Elise Johnson and
 Nasser Massadimi making bunting, and said to them: 'Are you guys sewing
 on buttons? It looks very fiddly work.' She added: 'It's quite therapeutic, isn't it?'

Danny
 Kruger, chief executive of Only Connect, which employs 25 people, told 
William and Kate he was 'enormously proud' to welcome them to their 
headquarters.

Mr Kruger, whose wife Emma founded the charity 
eight years ago, spoke to them about the importance of charities working
 together.

After the two-hour visit ended, he said: 'It was a 
great thing to have them giving us a pat on the back and for our members
 to get congratulated for their work and achievements, and I hope it 
means we can build our profile and do more work.'

Support: The Royal couple were at the offices of Only Connect which helps rehabilitate young offenders

Official: Prince William will be taking on more royal duties after resigning from his Search and Rescue role

Waiting: Photographers waited for hours in icy conditions outside the charity's Pentonville Road headquarters

Thrifty Kate's worn this piece before.

The Orla Kiely dresscoat worn by the Duchess of Cambridge sold out ‘within minutes’ of a public appearance on February 22 2012, a spokeswoman for the label said at the time.

Kate wore the coat for her first public engagement as royal patron of The Art Room, which encourages confidence in disadvantaged children.

Orla Kiely is famed for her retro, 70s-inspired prints

And she was so keen to get stuck in that
she ended up with red paint on the sleeve of her wool jacquard coat 
after taking part in a class.

As soon as the duchess was spotted wearing the brown dove-patterned garment, there was an ‘absolute frenzy’ on the website, according to a the brand.

The Birdie wool jacquard shirt dress was on sale for £162.50, down from £325.

Sadly, for Kate fashion fans, it is no longer on sale.

Kiely is an Irish contemporary designer, based in London, known for her unique retro prints and designs.

She has been dubbed the 'Queen of Prints' by the fashion world. A suitable choice for the future Queen of England, perhaps.

Trained in textile design, she began her career designing hats, but moved on to  handbags, clothing and a variety of other items - including kitchenware and cars.

Kate's also worn dresses by the designer. The new mum wore a steel-grey dress from Orla Kiely's Autumn Winter 2011 collection to the Dulwich Picture Gallery in March 2012.

At the time Kiely told Grazia magazine: 'When Kate wears one of your designs you get a boost.'

'The phone was ringing off the hook – email went, and one of my team counted over 800 Google alerts in that time! The only thing was, it was the end of the season so we didn’t have so many of the dresses in stock. But it’s a nice thing to happen.'
