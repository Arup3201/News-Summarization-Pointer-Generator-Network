It is known for its famous residents, expensive shops and huge sprawling mansions.

And now it appears getting a space to lay down your iPad in the posh London district of Mayfair will cost more than anywhere else in Britain.

A survey of the 10 biggest cities in Britain revealed that owning less than a square foot of property in Mayfair is likely to cost you 10 times more than purchasing exactly the same size space in Birmingham.

Mayfair in London is the most expensive place to own property space measuring the size of an iPad air while Birmingham is the cheapest, analysts found as they calculated how expensive property is in Britain's cities

The study took the size of an iPad Air, which measures 9.4ins by 6.7 ins, and worked out how much it would cost to own a space the size of the gadget. 

It found that in London's posh Mayfair this area would cost £1,430.61, while in Birmingham this is considerably cheaper at a price of £102.85.

Property website OnTheMarket.com did the survey to determine where the most expensive property area in Britain is. 

They used an iPad, rather than the typical measures of a square foot, so that people could visualise the space.

The analysis used the cost of two bedroom apartments in the cities to calculate the different cost of property space across the country, and found that a slice of space in Mayfair in London would cost more than £1,400

Birmingham is the cheapest city to 'lay down your iPad', with the small space costing around £102.85

The cost was worked out using the average price of a two bedroom apartment in each of the 10 cities to act as a control. 

London, Mayfair - £1,430.61

Manchester - £195.93

Bristol - £183.03

Leeds - £123.48

Sheffield - £144.61

Newcastle - £143.41

Liverpool - £133.21

Glasgow - £122.60

Nottingham - £115.84

Birmingham -  £102.85

Then analysts calculated how much a slice of the property - measuring the size of an iPad - would cost to give a figure.

Helen Whiteley, Commercial Director at OnTheMarket.com, said: 'The point of this analysis was to provide a clear visual example of property values and by using the iPad we provide an immediate and easy reference point to visualise a space.'  

Mayfair was by far the most expensive area to own the area of an iPad. 

And even London overall topped the list at an average price of £340.16.

Lewisham, seen as one of the more up and coming boroughs in the capital, came out with a price tag of £269.58 to own a slice of land, measuring less than a square foot. 

The next most costly area was Manchester, where an iPad sized plot would cost £195.93. 

This Grade II listed property in Mayfair that had an asking price of £45million was sold less than six months ago.

The mansion, in Balfour Place, boasted a staggering 19 bedrooms, seven reception rooms, six kitchens, 17 bathrooms and a roof terrace.

Spread over 13,000sq/ft, the property was around 15 times the size of the average newbuild in the UK.

The Arts & Craft property, built in 1891, was snapped up by a wealthy millionaire.

The property was marketed by Wetherell and Savills estate agents, with the deal confirmed by Peter Wetherell.

Due to a confidentiality agreement, Mr Wetherell would not confirm the final price paid or who had bought it.

However, if it is anywhere near the £45 million asking price, it would have been among the biggest sales of 2014.

The most expensive publicly listed deal of 2014 was £50 million for a flat in Knightsbridge. 

The property was designed by Eustace Balfour and has a five storey brick facade.

It originally featured large entertaining rooms and eight family bedrooms while the fourth and fifth floors were for staff.

Over the years it has had a number owners including several industrialists, a Dowager Countess and a City of London metal-trader magnate.
