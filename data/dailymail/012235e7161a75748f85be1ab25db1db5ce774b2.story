In Hollywood circles, Botox used to be referred to as 'liquid gold'.

But more and more celebrities are seemingly shunning injections and fillers to return to a somewhat au natural look.

Experts agree that the tide seems to be turning against surgical attempts to turn back time, with recent photos of A-listers such as Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox and Dannii Minogue looking more their age.

Shunning the needle? Courteney Cox sparked concern that she had taken her admitted use of Botox too far in 2013 (left) but is looking much more natural of late (pictured in November 2014, right)

The trend, spotted by Closer, has seen numerous stars looking less pinched and plastic, though still undeniably amazing for their age. 

Although Jennifer and Gwyneth Paltrow have admitted to only using Botox once, they are among a string of Hollywood's leading ladies whose appearance has caused them to be dogged by surgery rumours.

Mother-of-two Gwyneth, 42, has openly spoken about her dabble with Botox, saying it made her look like late comedian Joan Rivers.

Speaking to US Harper's Bazaar, the actress said she would be 'scared to go under the knife', although she admitted that may change as she gets older.

'I'll try anything. Except I won't do Botox again, because I looked crazy,' she said. 'I looked like Joan Rivers!' 

Cougar Town star and former Friends star Courteney Cox sparked concern that she had taken her admitted use of Botox too far in 2013, when she was pictured looking very puffy in the face.

The 50-year-old actress looked almost unrecognisable from her former days as lovable obsessive Monica Geller.

Gwyneth's face looks far less 'pulled back' with a few natural lines on her face (left in 2012, and right 2014) 

However, like her former co-star Jennifer, the mother-of-one has been looking more natural of late.

As well as her lips seemingly looking thinner, her cheeks look less puffy and there are some fine lines visible around her eyes. 

Similarly Kylie Minogue has been seen out and about with some natural lines and wrinkles, particularly around her eyes.

While still looking unbelievably youthful for her 46 years the Australian singer has lost her former 'plastic look'.

She admitted recently that she would no longer consider Botox, saying: 'I wont't go near it. I have lines, you can see them on my face.'

Kim Cattrall was one of the first stars to shy away from the trend for surgical help.

The 58-year-old Sex And The City actress has spoken about her desire to age gracefully.

Kim Cattrall, 58, left in 2010 and right in 2014, used Botox in the past but says she wants to age gracefully

She has previously admitted to using Botox on her forehead, but is too frightened to have surgery, saying in 2008: 'I don't want to look in the mirror and not recognise who's looking back.'

And it seems this A-list trend is trickling down to average women.

Anne-Marie Gillett, Non-Surgical Director at Transform Cosmetic Surgery, said: 'We have seen a significant rise in enquiries for non-surgical procedures to create a more natural finish whilst embracing the ageing process. 

'These include chemical facial peels, Microdermabrasion and IPL Skin Rejuvenation.

'We have also found that those requesting Botox are more frequently asking for a more natural look to beat the ageing process – using less product and leaving more time between their treatments. 

'We are seeing more women requesting to have some movement in their face rather than the frozen look.

'It's certainly becoming increasingly popular to seek a more sophisticated kind of beauty, rather than the taut and overdone look.'

John Ryan, Chairman at MYA cosmetic surgery, said: 'More and more of our patients, like celebrities, are keen to make sure their Botox and fillers look natural.

'Of course, it’s standard practice for us to make those recommendations. Why is it on the rise? 

'I think people have seen so many cases of bad jobs on either celebrities or acquaintances that it’s made them realise the effects too much Botox can have. It can make people look older.'
