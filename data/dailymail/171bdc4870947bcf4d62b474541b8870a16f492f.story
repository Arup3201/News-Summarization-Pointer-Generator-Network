Five students have been charged with sexually assaulting a woman and keeping her captive in a darkened dorm room at a New Jersey University.

The female student reported last week that she was attacked at accommodation at the William Paterson University and then held against her will.

According to the criminal complaint, the five men turned out the lights and used 'physical force or coercion' to attack the victim at the Overlook South residence hall.

Jahmel Latimer, one of the five men arrested and charged after a female student at William Paterson University claimed she was held captive in a darkened room and the sexually assaulted 

They then forced her to perform multiple sex acts before they stopped her from leaving the room.

Now five men, who all lived in university residences, have been arrested and are scheduled to appear at Superior Court in Paterson today.

Court documents show that the five men arrested were Noah Williams, Garrett Collick , Termaine Scott, Jahmel Latimer and Darius Singleton, who all studied at the University.

The men, who are all 18, are facing a range of charges from kidnapping to aggravated criminal sexual contact, and bail has been set at $200,000 for each suspect.

According to the Record, who obtained the complaint to police, Latimer is accused of pulling the woman by the hair and forcing her to perform sex acts.

The other four men are alleged to have conspired to commit sexual assault, restrained another person unlawfully and exposed them to risk of serious bodily injury.

The school's president Kathleen Waldron confirmed that all five of the accused lived at the university and have been 'barred from campus'.

In a statement she added: 'My deepest concern is for the victim of this criminal act who has courageously stepped forward to take legal action and seek justice.

'No expression of anger or sadness on my part can alleviate the harm done to the victim and my heart goes out to her and her family.'

The case comes just weeks after an article in Rolling Stone magazine described an alleged gang rape on campus at a fraternity house at the University of Virginia.

The article detailed the alleged sexual assault of a freshman woman by seven men at Phi Kappa Psi fraternity in 2012.

The university, in Charlottesville, has suspended all activities of its fraternities, sororities and related groups until January 9 to address sexual violence and assault.

Police are investigating and Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring said he would be appointing an independent counsel to review the school's sexual violence policies.
