Britain’s floods crisis could get worse before it gets better, David Cameron warned today as he urged the whole country to ‘pull together’.

The Prime Minister dramatically cancelled a planned visit to Israel next week to remain in charge of the government’s response to more storms forecast in the next few days.

Vowing that ‘money is no object’ in the relief effort, he promised new help to homeowners, businesses and farmers 'to piece their lives back together again'.

It came as Royal Bank of Scotland became the first lender to offer a three-month mortgage 'holiday' to homeowners facing huge repair bills after being flooded.

The Prime Minister insisted that the armed forces would remain on standby to deal with future emergencies caused by forecast storms

More than 1,500 members of Britain's armed forces have been put on standby to help communities wrecked by flooding, with 1,000 people forced to leave their homes in the South West and Thames Valley.

With 16 severe flood warnings, 133 flood warnings and 225 flood alerts still in force, with 1.5in of rain expected by Friday night.

In a rare press conference in Downing Street, Mr Cameron said: ‘"There is absolutely no sign of this threat abating, and with further rain and strong winds forecast throughout the week, things may get worse before they get better.'

More than 80,000 people have signed the Mail's petition to the Prime Minister calling for him to 'divert some of the £11billion a year spent on overseas aid to ease the suffering of British flood victims, and to build and maintain flood defences to prevent a repetition of this crisis'.

Flooded homeowners and businesses will be offered grants to build new flood defences, with companies also able to defer paying tax bills.

David Cameron pledged a major package of help for people affected by floods as he urged the country to 'pull together'. It included:

HOMEOWNERS

Grants worth several thousand pounds to build in better flood protection as they repair their properties

Insurance companies told to 'pay up the money fast'

BUSINESSES

A tax deferral scheme for businesses affected by the floods to give them longer to pay their taxes

Grants to help them improve flood defences

FARMERS

Up to £10 milliion to help them recover from the devastation to their livelihoods

But Mr Cameron insisted: ‘Money is no object in this relief effort. Where money is needed it will be spent. We will take whatever steps necessary.’

He vowed to continue to lead the national response by chairing meetings of the government’s emergency committee Cobra.

‘I am cancelling my visit to the Middle East next week,’ he added, after aides feared he would look like he had abandoned British families to fly abroad.

Mr Cameron revealed the military will play a bigger role, and by tonight there will be 1,600 servicemen and women deployed with ‘thousands more now available’.

Major General Patrick Sanders, Assistant Chief of the Defence Staff, is now co-ordinating the military effort.

The forces will work with the emergency services’ gold and silver commanders to ‘provide assistance and assurance to members of the public including by reinforcing sandbags and flood defences, getting medical assistance to the sick and inform and checking on a helping any other vulnerable people’, Mr Cameron added.

‘I urge everyone in those affected areas to keep listening to the warnings and to work with the emergency services, the military and who is working to keep people safe.’

A new Cabinet committee dealing with the clear-up will meet for the first time on Thursday, chaired by Mr Cameron.

His warning came as the Environment Agency (EA) said rises in the level of the River Thames were set to cause more disruption for flood-hit areas.

Around 1,000 properties have been reported as flooded in the past week, including 800 along the Thames.

Environment Agency senior flood adviser Kate Marks warned it was 'increasingly likely' 
that there would also be problems along the River Severn and River Wye.

The
 Prime Minister stressed that the focus must be on the flood defences, 
repairs and maintenance needed now, but there will be a time for lessons
 to be learned about mistakes made.

He repeatedly refused to be drawn on the future of under-fire Environment Agency chairman Lord Smith.

Royal Bank of Scotland is offering three-month mortgage repayment holidays to customers with flooded homes.

The group, which includes NatWest, said it would unveil full details of the scheme tomorrow together with contact numbers for customers to get in touch.

It said it would also send specialist business support teams to affected areas in coming weeks to help small businesses with short-term financial problems as they carry out repairs and suffer lost trading income.

The group, which is 80 per cent owned by the taxpayer, said the moves were in addition to a £250 million RBS/NatWest UK Storm Business Fund announced last month.

Mr Cameron added: ‘There are lessons 
to be learned from this experience and those lessons will be learned. 
Right now my focus is on the response.

‘It will be a long haul and it will require a stepped up national effort with the whole country pulling together.

A major package of help will be announced this week for homeowners, business and farmers.

Insurance
 companies will be told to ‘get out there’ so people can make claims to 
repair and redecorate homes devastated by flood waters.

Businesses hit by storms and floods will be able to defer paying tax bills while they get back on their feet.

Residential and business areas will also be offered more help to secure and improve flood defences.

And a £10million fund will be created for farmers to recover from the floods.

But today there were warnings that small 
businesses at risk of flooding could face 'exorbitant' insurance costs 
unless a Government-backed scheme is extended to cover them.

Labour leader Ed Miliband, who found himself out of his depth during a visit to floods in Wraysbury, called for the government to ensure homes get early payouts from insurance firms

Conservative peer Lord Moynihan said under the current system - a statement of principles agreed between the Government and insurers - businesses employing up to 49 people were covered.

He said the proposed new scheme contained in the Water Bill, which is currently going through Parliament, only covered households and 'micro businesses'.

It came after Labour leader Ed Miliband urged the Government to put pressure on insurance companies so that victims of the floods do not have to wait for payouts.

Mr Miliband said ministers had to act to ensure there was no repeat of the 'foot-dragging' that firms engaged in after the riots in 2011.

He said: 'Thousands of families have already been forced to abandon their homes and are now living with friends or family.

'They rightly want to know that this difficult experience isn't going to be compounded by months or years of delay in receiving the insurance pay-outs that will enable a home to be made habitable as soon as possible.'
