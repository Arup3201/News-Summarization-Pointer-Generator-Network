Kim Kardashian is undoubtedly the queen of self-promotion, posting 'selfie' snaps to her millions of followers on a daily basis and even releasing a book filled with her self-taken pictures.

And now, Kim's secret weapon to achieving the perfect photo has seemingly been revealed.

According to US Weekly, Kim uses the Perfect365 app to edit her famous selfies, with a source telling the magazine: 'Kim and all the Kardashians use the app Perfect365 to touch up their photos before they post them on social media. The Kardashians have gotten all of their friends into it.'

With skin, teeth and hair enhancers, the app claims it will help you achieve the complexion of a model with tools that let you soften skin, banish blemishes, erase under-eye circles and lengthen your lashes.

You can also control the intensity of each effect, give yourself a slick of lip gloss, a quirky new hair 'do and even adjust your mouth to make it appear as though you're smiling more.

Eyebrows can be thickened, your nose can be reshaped and you can give yourself a quick 'cheek lift', too.

The app, which is said to be used in the Kardashian household, claims it will help you achieve the complexion of a model with tools that let you soften skin and banish blemishes, which Harriet Jones, 21, tested out

The app also features a section called 'Hotstyle', which is full of makeup templates designed by the app's in-house team of beauty experts.

Looks range from dewy and natural, to sun kissed and glowing. There's also vivid and head-turning, as well as red carpet classy.

Speaking about the results of the app, the unanimous vote among our testers was: 'this is amazing'. 

Lucy Hull, 27, was pleasantly surprised with the results of the  app, which she used to give herself smoother skin and more defined brown eyes 

Josie Crane, who used the app to soften her skin and add a flushed glow, said: 'I was expecting to look ridiculous after using it but actually, the changes are so subtle. 

'I doubt anyone would bat an eyelid and would probably think I was just having a good day if I posted this on social media.'

Lara Thomas loved how you could add colour and definition to your face with a few clicks, and Ben Smith was so thrilled with the airbrushed finish on his snap that he's going to use it for his Tinder profile.  

Not only did everyone love their edited photos, other people in the office were quick to download the app to test it for themselves.
