Dane Cook bared all on Thursday night's episode of Watch What Happens Live.

The 42-year-old comedian appeared on the Bravo talk show, hosted by Andy Cohen, alongside CNN chief political correspondent Candy Crowley, and dished about his former costars, what his sex life is like when he is on the road touring, and the one man in Hollywood he would go gay for in a question and answer game wittily called called Cheese Dane-ish.

Cohen asked Cook a slew of very personal questions and, if he failed to answer any, Crowley had a can of spray cheese she would pump into his mouth.

Candid answers: Dane Cook talked about sex with groupies on Thursday's episode of Watch What Happens Live

Good question: Dane, shown with Jessica Simpson in Employee Of The Month revealed the dumbest thing she said on the set - and claims she didn't know what they were filming was a movie

The game kicked off with Cohen asking Cook who the most overrated comic is, to which the 42-year-old replied 'Gallagher,' the prop comic who became a semi-hit in the 70s and 80s and was known for smashing watermelons with a large wooden mallet.

Then, things got a bit more interesting when Cook, who has starred in films alongside actresses including Jessica Alba, Anna Faris, Lizzy Caplan and Demi Moore, was asked to reveal who was his worst onscreen kiss.

'Kate Hudson,' he quickly replied, who he starred with in the Razzie nominated 2008 flop My Best Friend's Girl. 

He then added, 'I think she purposefully ate like a feast of onions before the scene.' 

Next, Cohen asked Cook to talk about his Employee of the Month costar Jessica Simpson, and share with the world the dumbest thing she said while they were filming the comedy. 

'She said one day, ''Are we making a movie?'' That was kind of dumb,' Dane laughingly replied.

Having properly shamed his leading ladies, the talk then turned to his sex life, and how many college girls the comic slept with while on the road and touring at campuses around the country. 

'In my younger days, I would say a few hundred,' Dane replied.

At this point Crowley put the cheese down, realizing Cook was not going to leave any of Cohen's questions unanswered.

Finally, the very heterosexual Cook was asked by Cohen what male comic he would go gay for, to which he responded 'Gary Gulman,' who appeared on his Tourgasm tour.

And then, with nothing else left to reveal, the game was over.

Dane was stopping by the show to promote his new stand-up special, Dane Cook Troublemaker, which will air this Friday on Showtime.
