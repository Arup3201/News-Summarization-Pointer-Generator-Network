A thief was found with cigarette lighters, six watches, cutlery, nail clippers and a pen in his stomach after complaining of pains while in custody.

Dariusz Piotrowski attempted to evade being brought to justice by swallowing the proceeds of his crime.

The 39-year-old was in custody in Warsaw, Poland's capital, after being caught fleeing the scene of a house burglary.

Dariusz Piotrowski was found with cigarette lighters, six watches, a fork, a spoon, nail clippers and other stolen goods inside his stomach, after complaining of pains when he was arrested

While he was being held in custody in the cells, Piotrowski complained of stomach pains, prompting officers to call in the police surgeon.

Following an examination the doctor ordered an X-ray, baffled at the cause of the discomfort.

But the surgeon was amazed at what the scan showed.

The X-ray revealed a number of foreign objects inside Piotrowski's stomach, prompting medics to take the 39-year-old into theatre to remove the items.

The operation took several hours and at the end of the procedure, cigarette lighters, six watches, a fork, a spoon, a pair of nail clippers and a pen were left on the surgical table.

So unusual was the find, that the case has become an example of strange medical cases in the Polish Anaesthetics' Society, which posted the details on its Facebook page.

The caption alongside a picture of the stolen goods, read: 'The patient ate them.

'The
 patient was referred by the court to undergo psychiatric treatment 
after it was proved the swallowed watches were stolen.'  

The 39-year-old was arrested in Warsaw, Poland. Doctors spent hours in theatre removing the objects, which Piotrowski stole during a house burglary

A police spokesman said: 'Officers lost sight of him briefly after chasing him, but then found him hiding in the bushes of a garden of a nearby house.

'It was while he was crouched down in the shrubbery that he probably took the opportunity to try to mask his crime by eating the objects he had stolen.'

One officer said: 'It was a good job he wasn't standing next to any magnets. You have to imagine that he swallowed these things down without any fluid to help them on their way.'  

It is understood Piotrowski has told investigators that he has been able to swallow 'unusual' objects all his life - a strange ability that has aided him in his life of crime.
