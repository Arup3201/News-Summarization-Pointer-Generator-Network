Trying to save the dog, the good Samaritan then needed to be saved himself

A good Samaritan had to be pulled from a freezing river after risking his own life to save a stranger's dog.

The well-meaning 51-year-old man jumped into the icy water in Northumberland to try save a dog which was in trouble.

But things soon took a turn for the worse when the good Samaritan himself began to drown - other park-goers ran to find buoys to throw to him.

An unidentified good Samaritan jumped into freezing temperatures to save a stranger's dog from the icy waters of the River Wansbeck in Morpeth, Northumberland on the weekend

People then rushed to drag the man from the River Wansbeck in Morpeth, while others looked on anxiously.

He then had to be helped to safety by passers-by, who threw buoys after the freezing conditions in the river took hold

Witnesses said it took around ten minutes for the man to be hoisted to 
safety before the emergency services arrived to assess his condition.

The man was taken to Wansbeck Hospital to be checked over while the dog emerged safe and sound.

Police warned people not to go into icy water in any circumstances.

Sergeant Niall Mackel, from Northumberland Area Command, said: ‘Although
 this person was trying to help another member of the public by rescuing
 their dog, this only serves to highlight the dangers of going into open
 water.

‘Particularly with the recent freezing temperatures which can lead to even strong swimmers getting into difficulty.

‘We would always warn people against going into open water and to 
contact emergency services so that they aren't endangering their own 
lives in attempting a rescue.

‘Fortunately this didn't result in tragic consequences and I extend my 
thanks to those people who assisted this gentleman prior to emergency 
services arrival.’

John Phillips, from Morpeth, Northumberland, took pictures of the rescue while he was in the park with his son, Cameron, seven.

The 38-year-old coach builder said: ‘I was down at the park in Morpeth 
sledging with my son and I saw someone running with a buoy.

‘People were saying 'what is it, what is it?' and I looked along the 
promenade and there was a man with two buoys wrapped around him with a 
rope around them.

‘They were trying to pull him out of the water.  ‘There was a woman shouting and everyone was wondering what was going on.

‘The ambulance, police and fire brigade came but the man was already out
 by then.  It was the public that got him out of the water.’ 

The man was taken to Wansbeck hospital while the dog emerged safe and sound

Northumberland Fire and Rescue Service said three fire engines and their
 Swiftwater Rescue team were sent to the scene but the man was already 
in the care of paramedics.

Temperatures plummeted to well below freezing on Saturday night with heavy snow fall causing delays around the region's roads.
