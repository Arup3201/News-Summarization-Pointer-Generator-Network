The families of four Red Caps murdered by a mob in Iraq are demanding a fresh inquest into their deaths amid claims new evidence has emerged.

The relatives of Corporals Simon Miller and Russell Aston and Lance Corporals Benjamin Hyde and Thomas Keys have written to the Attorney General, seeking a new investigation into their deaths 11 years ago.

They are urging Dominic Grieve, the Government’s senior law officer, to quash the original unlawful killing verdicts returned after six Royal Military Policemen were slaughtered in Majar al Kabir, near Basra, in 2003, then order a new hearing.

The soldiers were cornered by hundreds of locals at a police  station and then executed. The killers have never been brought  to justice.

The families – unhappy with the inquests and board of inquiry investigations held into the  massacre – maintain that the deaths were avoidable and that questions remain unanswered.

They have claimed that the men could have been saved if it were not for Army negligence.

Yesterday the lawyer representing four of the slain troops wrote to Mr Grieve suggesting they  had fresh evidence which meant a new inquest was ‘necessary  and desirable in the interests of justice’.

Simon McKay said new  information cast doubt on the  time the soldiers died.

The original inquest, in 2006, ruled that the troops were killed between 10.30am and 11am on June 24, 2003.

But
 new witnesses, including an Iraqi interpreter, have suggested that the 
men could have been alive at midday – meaning that extra efforts could 
have been made to save the trapped Red Caps, he said.

His
 letter also claimed that commanders knew of intelligence that there was
 a ‘real and immediate threat’ to the soldiers’ lives.

A former SAS commander has told the 
families that military chiefs  knew that there was likely to be an 
escalation of violence in the area, driven by Iran. Mr McKay also said 
the ‘general prohibition’ on calling Iraqi witnesses at the inquest was 
‘irregular’.

Cpl Aston, 30, Cpl Miller, 21, L/Cpl 
Hyde, 23, and L/Cpl Keys, 20, plus Sergeant Simon Hamilton–Jewell, 41, 
and Corporal Paul Long, 24, were killed in the brutal attack.

The families of all six soldiers have long maintained the soldiers’ deaths were preventable.

They
 insist that commanders failed to take ‘reasonable’ measures to keep the
 Red Caps safe when they were deployed to the hostile town.

They
 claim commanders failed to give the Red Caps sufficient ammunition to 
defend themselves and did not provide them with roadworthy vehicles and 
effective communications to call in support.

The inquest into their deaths heard 
evidence that the soldiers had too little ammunition, old radios and no
 satellite phone when they were ambushed.

A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ‘Our thoughts are with the  families of those killed in this  tragic incident.

‘We remain committed to keeping the families informed of any progress in this case.

‘It is not for the MoD to question the findings of the coroner’s inquest.’
