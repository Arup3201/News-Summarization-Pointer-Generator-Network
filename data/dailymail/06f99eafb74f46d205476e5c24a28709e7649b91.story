An entertainment industry union has attacked the global beauty pageant Miss World after it was revealed its make-up artists will go unpaid.

Contestants began arriving in London yesterday for the competition, with events starting tomorrow, amid complaints that qualified artists would have to work for just a 'goody bag'.

Union BECTU waded into the debate after an email invitation was distributed to the make-up artist community by Colin Lapham, whose company ADCreativ won the beauty services contract.

It asked for 30 volunteers and was received by established make-up artists as well as graduates, claiming that the benefit to participants would be for 'credits' to their name.

'There are 130 contestants all with equal billing! They all need star quality hair and make-up with quick changes through the programme,' it said.

'There are also some build up events that require cover but in much smaller numbers. Everything is being filmed or photographed. 

'Everything is credits only. We ar [sic] not receiving any fees for this. We are organising this for the credits. There will be goody bags.'

But union communications officer, Sharon Elliott, said: 'The sense of outrage from qualified make-up artists wanting to make a living was palpable.

 'From BECTU's point of view, a view clearly shared by many hair/make-up artists, this invitation communicates an intention to break the law on the National Minimum Wage. 

An entertainment industry union, BECTU, has attacked the Miss World Organisation and said it communicates an 'intention to break the law on National Minimum Wage'

'In the UK, the law provides for all work to be paid, at least in line with the minimum rates. Not surprisingly, goody bags and credits don't count as pay.'

She added: ‘New and established make-up artists have to work really hard to earn a living in a very competitive sector. They need to be supported not exploited. Offers of work should be for paid work. 

'Current hair and make-up students should be backing this position too as otherwise next year, and the year after that, they too will find themselves struggling to earn a living as they are forced to compete against invitations to work for free. 

'Work experience, as an accepted part of a course of study can be done unpaid within limitations, however, it's plain that the invitation to work on the Miss World contest is just that, work.'

She added that the national minimum wage is also not the 'going rate' for qualified artists and in film and TV these skills command around £200 to £300 a day on seniority, genre and scale of production.  

The union will be raising the issue with HM Revenue & Customs, which monitors employers conduct, and advising members on how they can seek payment. 

'For now, we congratulate the make-up artists prepared to make a stand against exploitation and we invite many more in the creative sectors to stand with them,' she said.

Established make-up artist and beauty blogger, Mariam Jensen, told MailOnline: 'It's not acceptable.

'We have bills to pay and families to feed and we have been fighting for a long time for recognition for our work.

'Credits don't cover our travel, our kit, our products - which can all cost thousands. It's insulting.

'For new artists we need to be clear that this is not how the industry works - especially in TV jobs. And if students are going to be doing it that's more worrying.'

But Mr Laphan claims they have been oversubscribed and received 320 applications for the job.

He denied accusations of exploitation and told The Independent: 'We do things for credits all the time; it's the norm.'

Mr Laphan also said it will provide invaluable exposure and has been shocked by the response of his fellow professionals and added that his company was receiving no money.

'Having Miss World on my CV is more important than money,' he said.

A spokesman for the Miss World Organisation told MailOnline: 'The people engaged are an outside company who will be working with us on special occasions. 

'We do not have any dealings with their choice of beautician/hairdressers and have absolutely nothing to do with their payments.' 

The Grand Final of Miss World 2014 will be held at the ExCel Centre in London next month.
