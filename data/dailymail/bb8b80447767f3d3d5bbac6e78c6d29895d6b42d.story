The boisterous spectators at the Australian Open are being accused of distracting the players and being disrespectful, with many people now calling for their removal from the matches.

The rowdy fans have been screamed at by players, escorted out of the stadium by security guards and berated by umpires - yet the group refuse to desist. 

The group, aptly-named 'The Fanatics', make their presence known at every match and are renowned for their emphatic enthusiasm.

The fiercely patriotic Aussies shout, chant and dress up in bright, obnoxious costumes. However, many insist their out-of-hand behaviour is far from funny. 

Notably, both Russian Alexander Kudryavtsev and Latvian Ernests Gulbis furiously blamed the Fanatics for playing a part in each of their first round defeats.

On Day One tennis pro Gulbis became furious, screaming out at the crowd on numerous occasions as they noisily lent their support for 18-year-old local Thanasi Kokkinakis. 

'Shut up!' he shouted at a group of disorderly Australians, who were chanting 'we love you Kokky, we do' in support of Gulbis' competitor. 

Whilst complaining to the umpire he was again overcome with his frustation, yelling 'show some respect!' at the unruly crowd.

Kudryavtsev was also outraged by the Fanatics' behaviour at his own match.

'They are animals!' he was heard telling the umpire, pointing at the offending spectators dressed in yellow and green.

The Russian went on to lose the match against Australian Marinko Matocevic during an intense five-set battle.

Kudryavtsev double faulted to lose the fourth set; a crucial error he believed was due to noise and movement from the crowd, who failed to respect the player as he attempted to serve.

They were at it again two days later, causing an uproar when a crowd member shouted out at the most crucial point of the match between American Tim Smyczek and Spaniard Rafael Nadal.

Smyczek was applauded for his sportsmanship when he insisted his opponent be allowed another chance, due to the distraction from a loudmouth spectator at match-point.

Nadal had failed to return the American's serve reaching for the ball but missing due to a loud yell from a spectator.

Despite Nadal being so close to winning the tense, five-set match, Smyczek insisted he retake his serve - a decision which ultimately lost the American the match. 

The crowd's unfair disruption is accused of potentially changing the outcome of the match.

Many on Social Media were up in arms at the thoughtlessness of the spectators.

'Why on earth would you yell out on a match point? Have some bloody respect for those on court,' tweeted Mark Gottlieb.

'#fanatics are an abomination and a blight on this and every other sport. I’d ban them,' wrote Kimberley Ramplin.

Former Australian tennis great Pat Cash also spoke out this week, voicing his disapproval at the crowd's rowdy behaviour.

'If you invite international players out, you've got to treat them with respect,' Cash told News Limited.

'Crowd behaviour has been the disappointing thing of the Australian Open for the last few years.' 

The Tennis identity accused fans of acting 'out of control' and displaying 'unpleasant behaviour'.

Disgruntled viewers have taken to Social Media to voice their disappointment.

They are up in arms about the interference in the matches, deeming the spectators 'bogans' and even 'an abomination on the game'.

Rosie Evans ‏tweeted: 'The bogan fanatics are giving Australian fans a bad name. Please teach them some tennis crowd etiquette @TennisAustralia!'

'That's it. Ban the fanatics from the tennis! They are ruining my experience!' tweeted James Vear. 

'Dear @Channel7. the second u show the fanatics i am turning off. They are a disgrace and the whole country hates them,' tweeted Alan Hagley.

However, some players enjoy the presence of the boisterous crowd, with Australian Bernard Tomic unable to control his laughter at the crowd's antics.

As the Aussie tried to swat away insects, a member of the crowd yelled out, 'should have brought mortein', causing all present to burst on in laughter.

Similarly, Australian upcomer Nick Kyrgios played up to the crowd, asking them where his opponent Ivo Karlovic was going to serve and if he should challenge a shot. 

However commentators, players and spectators are questioning if this interaction, coupled with the rowdy antics, are inappropriate for the revered Grand Slam.
