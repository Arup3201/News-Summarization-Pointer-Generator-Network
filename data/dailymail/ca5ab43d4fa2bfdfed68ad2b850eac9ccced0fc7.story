Most people would go to great lengths to avoid being bitten by bedbugs.

Not so for one U.S. insect expert who decided to allow 1,000 of the creatures to give him a temporary 'tattoo'.

Johnny Fedora allowed the bedbugs to feast on his arm in a bid to see what would happen to his skin.

Johnny Fedora allowed 1,000 bedbugs to feast on his arm in a bid to see what they would do to his skin

Mr Fedora put a rabbit-shaped stencil over an open jar of bedbugs and then put it over his arm

Two hours after the experiment, he had a red, rabbit-shaped mark on his arm where he had been bitten

Mr Fedora placed a stencil of a rabbit over an open jar full of bedbugs.

He then placed his arm over the mouth of the jar and allowed the creatures to bite him, io9.com reports.

The colony of bedbugs was being kept to train a bed bug sniffing dog - Bob the beagle - to find them in hotel rooms.

Mr Fedora said while it was not painful he could feel the bugs biting him.

As they were feeding on his arm he could see them in the jar swelling up and turning red as they filled up with his blood.

Two hours after the experiment, he was left with a neat red rabbit-shaped mark on his arm.

After 24 hours the whole area had turned an angry red and the rabbit was no longer visible.

At this point, his arm was also very swollen and itchy.

About 24 hours after the experiment, the area was red, swollen and itchy and the rabbit was not visible

Mr Fedora then developed a series of blisters where he had been bitten by the bedbugs

Some 72 hours after the experiment, the rabbit-shape mark had returned and the blisters had gone down

He
 then developed a number of blisters which he says are an atypical 
response to bedbug bites - he says people who are bitten once or twice 
will not usually develop blisters but that having hundreds attack you 
can lead to pus-filled lumps.

By 72 hours after the experiment, the neat rabbit tattoo had returned. Two weeks later the mark had almost entirely disappeared.

Bedbugs are small blood-sucking insects that can live in the cracks and crevices around a bed.

They are attracted by body heat and crawl out at night to bite people and feed on their blood.

Some people develop no signs of the bites at all while others develop itchy red bumps.

They are not dangerous and they do not transmit any human diseases.
