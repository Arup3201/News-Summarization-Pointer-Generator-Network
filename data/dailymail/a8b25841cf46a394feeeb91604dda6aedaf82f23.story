Nemanja Matic returns to the Chelsea team after serving a two-match ban in domestic football and Jose Mourinho admits the club has learned valuable lessons from the way he was allowed to leave for Benfica.

Matic has become arguably the most important player in Mourinho's team, providing the midfield security and physical presence which allows others the freedom to create.

The Chelsea boss insisted he would 'never' have allowed the Serb to leave Stamford Bridge but understands how it happened and applauded the board for showing the courage to sign him again for £22million, three years after he joined Benfica as a makeweight in a deal to sign David Luiz.

Jose Mourinho believes Chelsea were 'brave' in deciding to bring Nemanja Matic back to Stamford Bridge

The 28-year-old has missed Chelsea's last two games against Tottenham and West Ham due to suspension 

'Chelsea were brave by bringing him back,' said Mourinho. 'If in this world you want to do the best for your club you don't protect yourself from possible critics. You simply do what you think is the best.

'We wanted a midfield player and we had on the table three or four but the best one he was a former Chelsea player. I don't say a player they lost but they were brave to say we are sure this is the right one, we are sure he is the best one, we are sure he is going to be a success here.

'Probably the next time Chelsea does a deal with a young player they will keep control. At these ages, the evolution of players can be good or bad. You can loan or even sell a player but you have ways of being in control of his future.

'Another aspect is the fact that Chelsea had so many managers in these years. It is difficult for the business people on the board. For one manager, Matic is the right profile of player, another one thinks Matic can go because I don't like him. This guy I like because he is fast, this guy I don't like because he is small.

'With a philosophy on the table, it is much easier for our board. If I was here, a left-footed player, 1.95 metres tall, would never, never, never leave. Never.'

Matic was handed a two-match suspension for pushing Burnley's Ashley Barnes 

Mourinho insists Matic wouldn't have been sold if he was in charge during the midfielder's first Chelsea spell

Matic was sent off against Burnley last month for a retaliatory push on Ashley Barnes and missed the Capital One Cup final against Tottenham and a London derby at West Ham, when young centre-half Kurt Zouma deputised in midfield.

He returns to the team for the Champions League last-16 tie against PSG at Stamford Bridge, which is poised at 1-1 after the first leg in France.

'It is goof to have him back with we did well without him,' said Mourinho. 'So I've told him maybe he is not so important. It was a bit of a joke and he laughed, but I told him we won a final and beat West Ham at West Ham, so we did well without him.

'But he is important, of course he is. He is very important in the balance of our team. Our team was developed with Matic in that position and everybody feels comfortable with him there.

'Zouma did amazingly well for us in those two games, in that position, but Zouma is a central defender and will always sbe a central defender, while Matic is Matic and the team feels very good with him.'
