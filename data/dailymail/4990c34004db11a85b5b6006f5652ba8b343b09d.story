It took Americans a few years before texting finally caught on, but now it appears that text messaging in the United States is on the decline.

The numbers of SMS text messages sent and received nationally dropped from 2.3 trillion in 2011 to 2.19 trillion in 2012.

In fact, people are messaging one another more than ever, however the manner in which they choose to communicate is switching to a method that is free.

In terms of texting, although the numbers are huge it still works out as a five per cent drop in usage.

Chatty: American's are now instant messaging more often using chat apps such as Whatsapp and Apple's iMessage rather than SMS texting

According to a report released by research firm Informa, one of the reasons texting may be 
declining is because chat applications are now becoming users 
preferred choice of communication because they're free.

U.S.
telephone networks used to charge users about 10 cents for each text message
but with the rise in smart phones came the rise in text or data 
packages.

It 
meant other apps like Apple's iMessage, WhatsApp, Viber, Nimbuzz, 
KakaoTalk. or BlackBerry Messenger that are not only free, but also more 
versatile became the logical choice.

It's
estimated mobile networks lost out on $25bn from texting revenue 
last year because of the growing popularity of chat apps.

In
countries like the U.S., where phone companies have kept the cost of 
text messaging high, the use of chat apps that helps avoid those 
fees, has exploded.

The 
in-phone chat apps often allow different types of media such as 
photos, music and video to be shared. Coupled with the fact the chat 
apps also deliver messages more quickly than texting, it's easy to 
see why they have become so popular, so soon.

Whatsapp's
popularity, in particular was highlighted last week, when Nokia 
unveiled the first phone to have a dedicated Whatsapp button built-in.

Falling popularity: Text messaging sent and received nationally dropped from 2.3 trillion in 2011 to 2.19 trillion in 2012 - a fall of five per cent

Stats: The average chat app users sent 33 messages a day, whereas SMS users sent just five a day

App happy: Nokia's Asha 210, the first phone to have a Whatsapp button built-in

The report estimates that around 19 text messages are sent or received per person daily.

CTIA, a body that represents the cellphone companies,
noted that its survey is put together from aggregated data from 
carriers serving 97 percent of all estimated mobile subscribers.

The
text message, or Short Message Service, was created in France and 
Germany in the 80s as part of the specification for the "GSM" digital 
cellphone standard.

The 
first commercial services appeared in Europe in the 90s. They were slow 
to appear in the U.S., where the cost of cellphone calls was much lower 
than in Europe.
