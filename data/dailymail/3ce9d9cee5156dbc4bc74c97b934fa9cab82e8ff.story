These cheeky monkeys were caught on camera showing off some pretty impressive acrobatic skills while enjoying a bit of play time in the early morning.

The troupe of vervet monkeys were photographed on a forest floor in the Great Rift Valley in Kenya.

Just after sunrise when the temperature is still cool the younger animals love nothing better than showing off their jumping skills.

Messing about: The little primates were caught in action as they played on a Kenyan forest floor

They were caught on camera by wildlife photographer Manoj Shah who said the energy of the little primates was amazing.

He said: 'After sunrise, the vervets come down from the trees they were sleeping on.

'The adult vervet monkeys are leading and the young ones follow.

'The young sub-adult vervets are fresh with energy and chase and play fight with each other.

'Mothers with very young babies watch the playful rituals from a distance.

'The display lasted for about an hour or so until the rising hot sun put an end to their energetic display.

Just playing: Wildlife photographer Manoj Shah, who captured the shots, was amazed by their energy

'It was awesome, I never knew that the monkeys had so much energy. In their playful mood they did not notice that I was photographing them.

'The monkeys were so agile, more versatile than circus acrobats.'

The vervet is an Old World monkey native to Africa. There are five distinct subspecies that can be found mostly throughout South Africa as well as some of the eastern countries.

Good friends: One monkey obviously wants to continue to play, while another appears to have had enough
