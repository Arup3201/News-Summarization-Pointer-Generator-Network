A nine-year-old boy from North Carolina has been forced to leave his favorite lunch bag at home because his school said it made him a target for bullies.

Grayson Bruce had been subjected to taunts and bullying from classmates over the My Little Pony-themed bag.

On Thursday, his school asked him to stop bringing in the blue pony-shaped bag because it was a 'trigger for bullying'.

Fan: Grayson's lunch bag is based on Rainbow Dash, his favorite character in the popular cartoon

His case comes less than two months after another North Carolina boy, Michael Morones, tried to take his own life after being bullied for his love of the cartoon.

Michael, 11, is still recovering in hospital after suffering brain damage from the attempt.

Both boys are part of a large male fan-base known as Bronies, who are drawn to the animation-style and moral values promoted in the show.

Because they fall out of the show's target demographic, Bronies can find themselves the target of bullies.

In Grayson's case, he says he has been pushed and punched because he is a fan of the show.

'They're taking it a little too far, with
 punching me, pushing me down, calling me horrible names, stuff that 
really shouldn't happen,' he told ABC 13.

The bullying became worse when he got a Rainbow Dash themed lunch bag, which is shaped like the blue pony character.

'Most of the characters in the show are 
girls, and most of the people put it toward girls, most of the toys are 
girlie, and surprisingly I found stuff like this,' Grayson said, as he showed off the bag.

His defense against attacks that the show is 'girly' because of the animated animal characters has been echoed by other Bronies in the past, who have pointed out other cartoons popular with boys, such as Pokeman, also had cute characters.

Grayson's mother, Noreen Bruce, said she was shocked by the school's response to the bullying and wants those involved punished.

She was appalled that the school had called his lunch bag a 'trigger for bullying', adding: '[It's] like saying a short skirt is a trigger for rape.'

Mrs Bruce also defended the show, saying: 'It's promoting friendship, there's no bad words, there's no violence, it's hard to find that, even in cartoons now.'

Fans of the show have also rallied round the schoolboy, setting up a Support For Grayson page for him on Facebook, which has more than 9,900 likes.

Voice actress Tara Strong, who played Twilight Sparkle on the show, also lent her support to Grayson, tweeting: 'Don't worry Grayson, I'll get 'em.'

A statement from Buncombe County Schools said: 'An initial step was taken to immediately address a situation that had created a disruption in the classroom.

'Buncombe County Schools takes bullying very seriously, and we will continue to take steps to resolve this issue.'

An online petition has been started, calling on the school to 'allow Grayson to bring his backpack to school, and crack down on bullying'.
