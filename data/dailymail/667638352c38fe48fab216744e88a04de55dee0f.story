Thousands of DNA samples have been taken in a bid to solve the murder of Valerie Graves (pictured)

More than 2,000 men came forward to donate their DNA as police try to solve the notorious 'Midsomer Murders' killing of a 55-year-old artist.

Police set up a base at a village hotel close to where mother-of-two Valerie Graves was found bludgeoned to death in a country mansion on December 30, 2013.

Officers were aiming to get DNA samples from men who live, work, or visit Bosham, West Sussex - which has a population of just 2,900 - to 'eliminate' them from the murder inquiry.

In just over three weeks, officers collected samples from 2,042 men aged 17 and over, which will now be sent for analysis.

The samples will be compared to the the limited DNA profile police have of Ms Graves' killer.

Officers set up a base at the Millstream Hotel, in Bosham, for the voluntary DNA screening and also had a major incident lorry parked at various locations for people to visit.

As well as being swabbed for their DNA, volunteers have also had their thumbprint and photograph taken.

The samples will only be used to check against this particular crime and their DNA profile will not appear on any database.

Legal safeguards are in place to ensure they are not used for any other purpose, police have said.

A police spokeswoman said: 'The total number of DNA samples collected over 22 days sessions was 2,042.

'These were volunteered at the Millstream Hotel sessions and at the major incident lorry which was parked at various locations in Bosham, Fishbourne and Chichester.

'The samples will now be sent for analysis.

'Detectives are hoping to get samples from 5,000 men - those who live, work or visit Bosham and work will be ongoing to encourage those men who have not come forward to do so.'

Detectives have said they will approach those who do not come forward voluntarily.

The investigation was launched after Ms Graves' body was discovered while she was house-sitting for friends.

Her death shocked the small community of Bosham, which featured in an episode of the ITV crime drama Midsomer Murders.

The grandmother was staying in the £1.6million mansion with her mother, Eileen, 87, her sister Janet, 60 and Janet's boyfriend Nigel Acres, 59, when she was brutally killed with a claw hammer.

The artist - who had just moved to West Sussex from Scotland - had gone to bed at 10pm on December 29.

Twelve hours later, her sister found her dead in a ground floor bedroom at the rear of the house.

A post-mortem examination revealed Ms Graves had suffered significant head and facial injuries at the house in Smugglers Lane.

Despite extensive investigations, during which police interviewed 9,500 people, and a Crimewatch appeal, her killer still remains at large.

Anyone with information about the murder should call 101, quoting Operation Ensign, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.

Police put up signs around the village asking residents to complete a voluntary DNA sample, which they say will help eliminate as many people as possible 

Sussex Police have been trying to discover the identity of the killer of the divorced mother-of-two for more than a year. 

But despite a £20,000 reward, the involvement of the National Crime Agency, a BBC Crimewatch appeal as well as a partial DNA profile of a suspect, her murderer has not been found.

Ms Graves was bludgeoned to death in one of the downstairs bedrooms of the luxurious waterside property in Bosham during the night of December 29 and 30, 2013.

Coincidentally, a 1998 episode of fictional detective series 'Midsomer Murders' which was filmed in the village featured a man bludgeoned to death in his bedroom.

The five-bedroom property in Bosham was being house-sat by Valerie’s sister, a teacher, and Jan’s long-term partner, 59-year-old architect Nigel Acres. 

They had known the owners, who were on holiday in Costa Rica, since the Eighties.

Within hours of the grim discovery the following morning, the entire village was teeming with police officers desperately searching for clues.

Officers first turned their attention to those in the house - statements were taken from everyone present and mobile phones were confiscated.

Valerie’s children were interviewed as well as was her ex-partner, Brighton-based musician and sound engineer Roy Wood, with whom she remained on amicable terms. 

On New Year’s Day, the murder weapon was found 870 yards from the house - a 16 claw hammer - as well as a partial DNA sample believed to have been obtained from the red and black-handled tool.

Police arrested 22-year-old insurance company worker Daniel Pereira, who was living in a Victorian worker’s cottage near where the murder weapon was found - but he was also quickly eliminated from inquiries and released without charge. 

A reconstruction of the crime, filmed at the property known as Hove To for BBC Crimewatch in October last year, resulted in just 20 phone calls from the public.

Last month, detectives announced plans to DNA-test every man in the village as well as outlying areas in a bid to flush out the culprit and force a breakthrough in their investigation, codenamed Operation Ensign.  

In December last year, Ms Graves' two children Tim Wood, 32, and Jemima Harrison, 35, spoke ahead of the first anniversary of her murder.

Mr Wood said: ‘It’s hard to carry on, knowing that someone is out there able to do it to someone else and knowing that they haven’t been caught for what they have done.’

The family said Christmas was put 'on hold' as they faced their first festive season without her.
