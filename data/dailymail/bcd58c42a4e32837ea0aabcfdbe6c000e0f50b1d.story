American-born Douglas McAuthur McCain was allegedly killed over the weekend fighting for ISIS in Syria 

An American man believed to have been killed in Syria was there to fight alongside a terrorist group, most likely the Islamic State, a U.S. official said Tuesday.

Investigators were aware that Douglas McAuthur McCain had traveled to the country to join a militant group, but they did not yet have his body and were still trying to verify information about his death, said the official, who was not authorized to discuss by name an ongoing investigation and spoke only on condition of anonymity.

A relative, Kenneth McCain, told The Associated Press that the State Department had called to tell his family that Douglas McCain had been killed in Syria. "We do not know if he was fighting anyone," he said.

U.S. law enforcement and intelligence officials have expressed concern about the influence of hard-line jihadists who are among the rebels seeking to overthrow Syrian President Bashar Assad.

Officials say fighters from the U.S. or Europe looking to join the cause could become radicalized and import those influences and terrorist skills when they return home.

It was unclear when McCain, who had most recently lived in San Diego, traveled to Syria. He grew up outside Minneapolis in the town of New Hope, where he graduated high school in 1999.

A cousin, Kenyata McCain, told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that she had spoken to McCain as recently as Friday and 'he was telling all of us he was in Turkey.'

'I know that he had strong Muslim beliefs,' she told the newspaper. 'But I didn't know that he was in support of ISIS. I didn't think he would be.'

At an apartment complex in New Hope, Shelly Chase remembered McCain as a friendly boy who welcomed her 9-year-old son, Isaac, when the Chase family moved in some two decades ago.

Even though McCain was a few years older, the boys used to lift weights, hit punching bags and play basketball.

Both Shelly Chase and her son, now 28, fought back tears as they talked about McCain.

'I'm holding in the tears, I really am, because this is hard. He was a good kid,' Shelly Chase said.

'Someone must have persuaded him.'

Isaac Chase said he had always looked up to McCain. Chase joined the military in 2007, and said before he left, he knew McCain was running into trouble, sometimes smoking marijuana at the park.

'I don't know if he was just lost or what,' Isaac Chase said. 'He was a good person at heart.'

He said he last talked to McCain in 2008 when he was home on leave. McCain told Isaac he was proud of him, and he was trying to straighten out his own life, Isaac said.

FBI Director James Comey said in June that roughly 100 people had left the United States to join the conflict in Syria.

Comey said the terrorism threat of today 'has spread, metastasized. ... The traveler problem makes it even more difficult, because the people going to Syria are not from any particular demographic. They're not from any particular part of the United States.'

Comey's remarks came during a visit to the FBI's field office in Minneapolis, which has struggled in recent years with several young Somali-Americans leaving the United States to join the terror group al-Shabab in Somalia.

FBI spokesman E.K. Wilson said agents continue to investigate reports that several young men have left the Minneapolis area for overseas locations, including Syria.

'We have done extensive outreach recently, as we have the last seven years, but we've had a concerted effort ... over the last few months,' he said, as reports of travel to Syria surfaced.

Friends of McCain were incredulous after being told of the circumstances of his death.

'He was a goofball in high school,' a classmate told NBC. 'Doug was a fun guy to be around. Played basketball, joked a lot, had a small sense of humor. Got along with most … Wasn't the best athlete, but liked to play.”

Another friend who would go to teen nights at the YMCA with McCain called him a 'good guy who loved his family and friends.

'He would be the light in anyone's darkness. He always made you smile with his goofy self.'

After graduating in 1999, he stayed in Minnesota for some time according to his criminal record.

He was arrested in 2000, at the age of 19, for disorderly conduct and then again in 2006 for obstruction. He was convicted on both charges.

According to his Twitter, he converted to Islam around 2004, referring to himself as 'Duale ThaslaveofAllah' and his online posts become much more fervent.  

ISIS are an extremist group currently invading Iraq from Syria in an attempt to establish a caliphate. Last week they brutally beheaded American journalist James Foley in a video posted online

Among his likes on Facebook are the 'Quaran and Hadith' and 'The Black Flag' as well as Pizza Hut and the Chicago Bulls

At some point he traveled to Sweden where he performed sometimes as a rapper.

Kevin Kohlin knew him there and says they often played basketball together and chatted about hip-hop music.

'We would talk just a little bit about religion,' Kohlin added. 'He respected my Christianity.' 

It appears that McCain crossed into Syria from Turkey in the last few months. He tweeted to another ISIS fighter in June his intention to join them in 'r town' - mostly likely meaning Raqqa

McCain appears to have moved back to San Diego recently where he worked at a Somali restaurant for sometime.

An acquaintance at the restaurant said he was normal and 'open-minded' and just 'wanted to be a good Muslim'.

In September 2010, he posted an ominous image that had the caption, 'They are coming back soldiers of Allah.'

His MySpace profile contains similar messages, with photographs of McCain with the Quaran captioned, 'The Quran is all I need in this life of sin.'

In April, McCain retweeted an English translation of a speech given by an ISIS spokesman and soon after that was spotted in Turkey - a common entryway into Syria.

McCain attended high school in Minnesota where he played for the basketball team, and once performed as a rapper

Three months ago, McCain met with friends at a Burger King in Istanbul where they talked about the NBA

In May, McCain began praising the decade anniversary of his conversion to Islam and began to message and friend self-declared jihadis online.

On June 9, he tweeted to another ISIS fighter that 'I will be joining you guys soon'.

He also asked if another jihadist had made it to 'r town' - most likely referencing the ISIS-stronghold city of Raqqa.

Later he posted: 'I'm with the brothers now'.

His last tweet was on August 19.

Following his death, the Free Syrian Army shared pictures of McCain's passport and his body, showing off a distinctive neck tattoo.

Several of McCain's friends and family members have taken to Facebook to mourn his loss. 

His younger sister  posted a collage of three pictures with her brother, and wrote a brief memorial.

'I really don't understand why and how and I have no words, I never thought this will be the way we say goodbye. You where my oldest brother, my biggest headache, the one I argue with the most, my words when I needed you to be. I can hear you now saying "lele guess what, I'm awesome" and that big brother you are This is absolutely unreal to me I love you big brother.'
