Parvaiz Iqbal died in his butchers in Eastwood, Rotherham, yesterday

A relative of a butcher who was stabbed to death in his shop has revealed how people desperately tried to save his life.

Parvaiz Iqbal died in his butcher's shop in Eastwood, Rotherham, yesterday.

One of Mr Iqbal’s employees, who tried to help the popular 40-year-old father-of-three boys at the scene, was also stabbed and suffered a serious stomach wound.

Police later arrested a 27-year-old on suspicion of murder near a Tesco store, after earlier reports of a man running through the town centre with a machete.

Councillor Mahroof Hussain, who is the cousin of Mr Iqbal’s mother, said the shop was particularly busy yesterday ahead of the Eid celebrations.

He said: 'Parvaiz went into the fridge and the guy went after him with a knife.

'Obviously something was happening and other workers came in to prevent it. 

'One of them got stabbed in the stomach.

'Another guy working upstairs heard the commotion and the man with the knife went outside and started smashing the place up, then ran off, smashing car windows as he went.

'People came in to the shop to help.

'The man ran off into town with a knife - obviously being a butchers, there’s lots of knives there.

just hope the co-worker recovers and can give a statement to the
