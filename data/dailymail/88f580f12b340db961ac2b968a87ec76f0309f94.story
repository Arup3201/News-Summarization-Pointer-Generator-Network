Are you dreaming of a white Christmas?

If so, this map may - or may not - be the answer to your wishes. 

According to the NOAA graphic, residents of Minnesota, Maine, upstate New York, Idaho, West Virginia and the Allegheny Mountains of Pennsylvania are likely to see snowfall on December 25.

Meanwhile, those in the bottom half of the Lower 48 states, including Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Mississippi and Georgia, have a significantly lower chance of experiencing a white Christmas.

A white Christmas? According to this NOAA map, residents of Minnesota, Maine, upstate New York, Idaho, West Virginia and the Allegheny Mountains of Pennsylvania are likely to experience a white Christmas

The map, posted on the Administration's website, measures the historic probability of there being at least one inch of snow on the ground in various American states on Christmas Day.

It is based on 'climate normals' from NOAA's National Climatic Data Center, from 1981 to 2010.

Dark gray shows the states where the probability of a white Christmas is less than 10 per cent, blue depicts where chance is around 50 per cent, and white shows probabilities higher than 90 percent.

According to the graphic, Aspen, Colorado, is one of only around a dozen locations in the Northwest boasting a 100 per cent historical probability of seeing snowfall on December 25.

Winter: This graphic, also by NOAA, shows snow depth across the US today (Sunday, December 14)

Snowy: This NOAA satellite image, taken on Saturday, shows an area of low pressure over the Intermountain West. Snow is shortly expected to move across Montana and Idaho - and could stick around for Christmas

Unsurprisingly, the Rockies or the Sierra Nevada Mountains are also expected to see the white stuff. 

Despite the predictions, there is always the chance that the weather will take a surprising turn, potentially resulting in a white Christmas for areas that do not expect it. 

In 2004, a snowstorm on Christmas Eve brought the first white Christmas in 50 years to New Orleans, and the first one ever recorded to Houston, Texas.

Meanwhile, the Florida winter storm of 1989 brought snow to a number of unsuspecting cities, including Pensacola and Jacksonville, on Christmas Day.

Snowy: Michael Russell uses a snowblower to clear snow along South Nice Street in Frackville, Pennsylvania on Thursday. The state's Allegheny Mountains  are likely to see snowfall on December 25, the map reveals

Hazardous conditions: Matthew Hazard cleans snow from his vehicle after several inches fell in Soda Springs, California, on Thursday following a severe storm. Parts of the state could see a white Christmas this year
