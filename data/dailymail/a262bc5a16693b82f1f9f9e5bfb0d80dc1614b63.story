A mother-of-two has been accused of faking cancer in a bid to get donations from well-wishers hoping to help speed her recovery.

Martha Nicholas, 42, of Hanover, Virginia, posed as a four-time cancer victim and played on the sympathy of friends and family, authorities said.

Numerous fundraising events were allegedly held in her honour and tens of thousands of dollars were raised to help pay her medical expenses.

Nicholas, who is married, allegedly used a wheelchair after claiming she was too weak to walk from chemotherapy sessions.

Her two children, aged 10 and 13, are believed to have grown up having been told by Nicholas that she was dying of cancer.

Nicholas became an inspiration to other sufferers as she attended events where she spoke about her battle with the killer disease.

In one fundraising event earlier this year she spoke to hundreds of people and tearfully told them: ‘My diagnosis is terminal.’

Fundraisers allegedly paid for her to travel to Arizona and Texas for chemotherapy treatment.

Others offered to lend her their beach homes so she could recover from treatment. But investigators said her diagnosis was a complete sham.

Doctors at the Virginia Cancer Hospital where she claimed she was being treated said they have no record of her as a patient.

She was also unable to provide a local 
news show with a single photograph of her while undergoing chemotherapy 
she claimed to need.

Investigators believe she had tens of thousands of dollars donated and have asked the public to say how much they gave to Nicholas.

The investigation into Nicholas began in April after detectives received a tip off that she conning people out of money.

Nicholas was very vocal in her fight against cancer and appeared at numerous fund raising events.

Even after she was under investigation she attended a charity event where she was selling T-shirts with the words ‘Cancer Sucks’ across the front.

In one event, filmed by 8News, Nicholas appears on a podium to talk to a crowd about her cancer.

'What about the "Cancer Sucks t-shirt" fundraiser for her? What about her trip to Texas for treatment followed by her trip to Arizona for treatment?'

She tells the audience: ’My diagnosis is terminal and each night I wonder if it will be my last.’

Nicholas tells the crowd that she was diagnosed with stage four Ovarian cancer when she was 22.

She is understood to have claimed the cancer returned and she is a four-time survivor of the disease.

Detectives with the Hanover County Sheriff's Office tried to speak with Nicholas when they launched their investigation, but she refused to talk.

They followed up on a list of hospitals, doctors, procedures and treatments that Nicholas claimed she had received.

But they found no evidence that confirmed she had been diagnosed with cancer.

‘Our investigation revealed no evidence 
of any cancer treatment at any medical facility that had been publicly 
identified by Martha Nicholas during her many public appearances and 
testimonials,’ Captain Michael J. Trice of the Sheriff’s Office said.

‘Investigators also found evidence of individuals that had given money to Martha Nicholas due to her proclaimed medical condition.’

Friends who helped Nicholas reacted with shock and anger following her arrest for obtaining money under false pretenses.

Steve Gormley, writing on local TV station WTVR’s website, said: ’What about the “Cancer Sucks t-shirt” fundraiser for her?

‘What about her trip to Texas for treatment followed by her trip to Arizona for treatment? Was she just kicking up her heals during her time away?'

Nicholas was charged with two counts of misdemeanour obtaining money by false pretences. She is expected to appear in court next Friday.
