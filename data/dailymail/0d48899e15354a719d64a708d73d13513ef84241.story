A new smartphone app could finally solve the scourge of abandoned trolleys and the damage they cause to the British countryside.

The Trolleywise app - available for Apple and Android devices - lets users send photos of abandoned trolleys along with their GPS locations to a national collection service.

One of 47 local Trolleywise vans can then be sent to the location within 24 hours to recover the trolley and return it to nearby supermarkets - saving local authorities and retailers millions of pounds in clean-up costs each year.

The new Trolleywise app lets users take photos of abandoned trolleys on their smartphone phones. The photos and the GPS coordinates are then sent to a national collection service, which sends a van within 24 hours to recover and return the trolley to nearby supermarkets

According to Trolleywise, more than half of all shopping trolleys in service in the UK - around 1.5 million - go missing from supermarket car parks each year.

Many end up on wasteland, housing estates, parks, railways or water ways and are dangerous to wildlife and children.

Jeff Whyatt from The Canal and River Trust said: 'We have a national treasure of canals in this country, but they're often blighted by fly-tipped trolleys.

'They're an eyesore, but also they're a danger to boats and the ecology of the canal.

'Furthermore they make the canals just look unloved.'

His company has been working with Trolleywise for three years to help deal with the problem in the 'most efficient manner.'

The Trolleywise app is free and is available on Apple and Android devices. The company has 47 collection teams in vans across the country that can respond to abandoned trolley reports. Users can specify a location, shown in the right-hand screen grab, or use GPS to automatically locate them

According to Trolleywise more than half of all shopping trolleys in service in the UK - around one million - go missing from supermarket car parks each year. Many end up on wasteland, housing estates, parks, railways or water ways

There are around two million trolleys in operation in the UK at any one time.

Around 1.5 million trolleys are taken from supermarket car parks each year.

Many are abandoned in wasteland, parks, waterways and housing estates.

Trolleywise has 47 collection teams that pick up around 400,000 trolleys a year.

According to Whyatt, if all the trolleys recovered were stacked on top of one another, they would be taller than Canary Wharf.

Local authorities, retailers and environmental charities spend millions of pounds each year returning trolleys to supermarket car parks.

Local authorities are currently responsible for 
rounding up abandoned trolleys.

They then charge some of the repatriation back to the
supermarkets, often by way of fines.

These costs are passed onto consumers through increased council tax bills and higher food prices.

The new Trolleywise system, which is 
backed by all the major supermarkets including Asda, Tesco and Sainsbury's, lets consumers 'take control of a 
more rapid and joined-up clean-up.'

A Sainsbury's spokesperson told MailOnline: 'All our stores want to be a good neighbour so we work with Trolleywise to ensure any abandoned trolleys are quickly collected. 

'We hope other retailers will follow our lead in recognising their responsibilities to the communities they serve and sign up to this scheme.'

Tony Barber, managing director of Trolleywise said: 'We have made a substantial impact in managing the 
abandoned trolley challenge, with Trolleywise retrieving almost one 
million trolleys since 2012.

The Trolleywise has three main sections - a welcome screen, a Report A Trolley function that lets users send abandoned trolley locations to a national collection service, and a stats page that shows the users how many trolleys they're reported and where they found them

'However, we want to eliminate the problem 
altogether and return pride to our local communities.

'The app makes it 
very easy for people to report trolleys quickly and accurately.'

For every trolley collected by Trolleywise, the team donates to independent charity Trees for Cities.

The campaign hopes to 
raise enough money to plant at least 2,000 new trees in Britainâ€™s urban 
areas each year, the equivalent of taking almost 150 cars off the UK 
roads.

Barber continued: 'By 
swapping abandoned trolleys for trees, we want to make a positive impact
 on communities.''

Sharon Johnson, CEO of Trees for Cities, added: 'We often come across
 abandoned trolleys as part of our tree-planting work in local 
communities.

'We hear from our volunteers that there is confusion about 
how to report them and whose responsibility it is to pick them up.

'Weâ€™re delighted that Trolleywise has launched this app to make 
the process so simple.'

As well as being eyesores, abandoned trolleys can cause environmental damage. Local authorities are currently responsible for recovering trolleys and returning them to supermarkets. This can costs both councils and retailers money and these costs are then passed onto consumers through council tax and food price rises

Trolleywise launched in 2006 to help reduce the impact abandoned trolleys have on the local environment, said Barber: 'because when they get abandoned there's a big drain on the local councils and on  retailers to try and collect the trolleys and put them back into service. '

He said that trolleys can end up in many places and the company had even recovered a trolley from on top of a bus stop.
