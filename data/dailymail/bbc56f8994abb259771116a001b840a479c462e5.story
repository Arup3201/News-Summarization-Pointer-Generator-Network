A local news reporter who arrived on the scene of drug bust captured a bizarre interview with a bearded, staff-toting man who lives in a school bus nearby.

Channel 9 reporter Joleen Chaney was attending the scene where police found 50 marijuana plants in a house when she ran into Sir John Michael, who wears a ponytail held by rubber bands and a bearskin vest.

Police were responding to reports of a gunshot when they smelled cannabis in the house of David Mason and arrested him, according to the Oklahoma City outlet.

However the attention of police and the news reporter was soon diverted by the strange character who lives in the woods.

Sir Michael said that there were no gunshots and that the loud noise came from when he 'busted' the window of his big, yellow home with a crowbar after becoming frustrated when working on the vehicle.

He said that soon after the noise 'a half a dozen guys with their guns drawn on me' came out of the forest and told him to put down his gun, though he was just twirling his ponytail.

The man wears his underpants over women's leggings and carries a long staff with a crystal on the end.

He said that he had previously seen police helicopters circling overhead when he was sunbathing nude.

At one point in Ms Chaney's interview, the man attempts to impart wisdom and says 'If life gives you lemons, f*** life'.

It is not known how he first became called Sir John Michael.

He said that he lives in the school bus because of a 'long story' that involves his mother and ex-wife.

Sir Michael said he was going to bail his landlord David Mason (pictured) out of jail, but a bail bond company ended up putting up the money

Ms Chaney said that Sir Michael was initially skeptical about doing an interview, but was coaxed into it after she said that he would look crazy on TV if he didn't, the reporter told the Rick and Brad Morning Show.

Though he supports legalizing marijuana, the local news celebrity is reportedly not involved with growing marijuana on the property. 

He did, however, say he was going to bail his landlord, Mason, out of jail.

The Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office confirmed that Mason had been bonded out of jail on Wednesday, the day after his arrest, for $10,000.

A company called Any Bondput forward the money.

The sheriff's office said that members of the Oklahoma City Police Department searched Sir Michael's bus after marijuana was found in Mason's house.

Nothing illegal was found on the vehicle, the Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office told Daily Mail Online.

Ms Chaney said that her unique interview subject also had a music recording studio in his home.

She said Sir Michael was originally wearing an inside-out shirt but wanted to dress up into his more formal bearskin attire after deciding that he was going to do an interview.

Social media users have applauded Ms Chaney's poise and lack of laughter during her conversation with the Oklahoma noble.
