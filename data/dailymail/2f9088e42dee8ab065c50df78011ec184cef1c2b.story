Jacques Burger will be available to play in Saracens' European Champions Cup semi-final against Clermont Auvergne in Saint Etienne on April 18.

The Namibia flanker received a one-week ban after he appeared at a Champions Cup disciplinary hearing on Thursday.

Burger, who will miss Saracens' Aviva Premiership appointment with play-off rivals Leicester at Allianz Park on Saturday, had been cited by the match commissioner for striking Racing Metro scrum-half Maxime Machenaud during last weekend's Champions Cup quarter-final victory in Paris.

The Namibia flanker received a one-week ban for the offence but will be available to face Clermont 

Announcing the verdict, European Professional Club Rugby said: 'The independent judicial officer Simon Thomas (Wales) heard submissions and evidence from Burger, who pleaded guilty to the offence, from Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall and from the Saracens team manager JP O'Reilly.

'Submissions and evidence were also presented by the tournament disciplinary officer.

'In upholding the citing complaint, the judicial officer determined that the offence was reckless and warranted a red card, and that it was at the low end (two weeks) of World Rugby's sanctions for offences of this nature.

'There were no aggravating factors, and he reduced the suspension by the maximum amount of one week due to the player's guilty plea, early expression of remorse, good conduct during the hearing and clean disciplinary record.'
