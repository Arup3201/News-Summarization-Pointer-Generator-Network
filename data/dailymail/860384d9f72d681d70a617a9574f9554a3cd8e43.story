Tony Blair sent Rebekah Brooks a series of text messages signed off with kisses at the height of the phone hacking scandal, it was revealed yesterday.

The former prime minister repeatedly offered the beleaguered newspaper executive help as she prepared to face questions from MPs in the days before she was arrested.

The messages he sent from the Middle East, where he was acting as a peace envoy, were revealed to the phone hacking trial as the former Sun and News of the World editor gave evidence about the days leading up to her arrest.

Advice: Rebekah Brooks received a string of supportive text messages from Tony Blair

Friendship: The former Prime Minister signed off his messages with the letter 'x'

The jury has heard that Mr Blair 
offered himself as an ‘unofficial adviser’ to Brooks, 45, and Rupert 
Murdoch in an hour-long phone call in which he told her: ‘It will pass. 
Tough up.’

Mr Blair also texted Brooks on the day of the 
tabloid’s final edition in July 2011 – and the last text message was 
sent just a day before Brooks was arrested.

The first message came on July 10, 
2011, the day the News of the World was shut down, with Mr Blair trying to arrange a 
meeting with Brooks to give her advice.

At 8.30pm, he wrote: 'Hi it's Tony, I've just landed. Is it too late to speak or should we stick with tomorrow.' 

Brooks, 45, replied twelve minutes later to say: 'Let's stick to tomorrow', adding in a further message: 'Can't wait xx'.

The following day, Mr Blair texted at 10.48am to asked: 'What's the best number for you? I'm ready to speak.'

Brooks replied at 1.31pm: 'Sorry. Only just escaped meetings. When is a good time? X

He replied at 1.55pm: Now. Call my hotel landline.' He gave the number and told her: 'Ask for room 610.'

In a further message, he wrote: 'I'm in the Mid East. Call me when you can. T x'

His advice 
was given in the days after the News of the World was forced to close 
because of public anger over the illegal hacking of murdered schoolgirl 
Milly Dowler’s phone.

Couple: Brooks and her husband Charlie arriving at the Old Bailey this morning for the phone hacking trial

Leaving: Brooks outside court after her 13th day giving evidence in the trial

The security guard accused of helping Rebekah Brooks hide evidence from police has fractured his skull.

Mark Hanna was absent from the Old Bailey today after sustaining an injury in an accident. 

His
 lawyer, William Clegg QC, told the court: 'Mr Hanna is absent today 
again. He met with an accident over the weekend and last night was 
diagnosed with a hairline fracture of his skull.   

'He has been directed to have bed rest before he is reviewed by doctors again. We hope he will be back with us next week.'   

Hanna,
 the head of security at News International, is accused of helping 
Rebekah Brooks and her husband Charlie remove incriminating documents 
and computer evidence from their home.   

He
 was also a key part of Operation BlackHawk, the security team charged 
with protecting Brooks at the height of the phone hacking scandal.

The next message was from Mr Blair on 
July 15 - the day Brooks resigned from her job - saying: 'I'm really 
sorry about it all. Call me if you need to. T x.'

The following day, he told her: 'If you're still going to Parliament you should call me. I have experience of these things! T x'

The
 revelations about Mr Blair’s behind-the-scenes contact with Brooks 
could be embarrassing for Labour, which has sought to distance itself 
from accusations it was too close to the Murdoch empire.

After
 13 days of evidence, prosecutor Andrew Edis QC said she had enjoyed a 
‘meteoric rise’ at News International and had been in control of her 
alleged co-conspirators, either as their boss or through marriage.

He
 suggested her success was based on her relentless pursuit of stories 
for her newspapers without caring if they were sourced through hacking 
or corrupt payments.

In a 
dramatic conclusion to five days of cross-examination, he said: ‘You 
were running your world and not much happened in it which you didn’t 
want to happen when you were at the top of the tree.’

He went on to say:
 ‘Your evidence has been a carefully presented and prepared script that 
bears little relation to the truth.’

Brooks
 denies conspiring to hack phones, commit misconduct and pervert the 
course of justice. All seven of the defendants in the trial, including 
her racehorse trainer husband Charlie Brooks, deny all the charges 
against them.

The trial continues.

Help: Brooks planned to ask Lord Mandelson for coaching before her appearance at Parliament

Rebekah Brooks wanted to seek advice from Peter Mandelson on how to survive being interrogated by MPs over the phone hacking scandal, a court heard today.  

The Labour grandee was due to be asked to meet the News International chief at a farmhouse in Oxfordshire when she was called to appear before the Culture, Media and Sport select committee.  

However, the training session was abandoned when Brooks was forced to resign in the wake of revelations about hacking at the News of the World, and was subsequently arrested. 

The hacking trial at the Old Bailey has previously heard that Tony Blair offered advice and support to Brooks at the height of the scandal in July 2011.  

Giving evidence for a 13th day, she told the jury that Lord Mandelson, the former Business Secretary, had agreed to coach her before her select committee appearance, and she had wanted him to come to a friend's house, Enstone Manor Farm.  

'We were all going to have a full debrief for the select committee and we were going to have a preparation session', she said. 'I was very inexperienced at dealing with televised select committees.' 

Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC said: 'You were going to have a mock session so you could practice, and you wanted to ask Mr Mandelson to see if he will come and help?' 

Venue: Brooks was planning to spend the weekend at Enstone Manor Farm, pictured

Brooks replied: 'Lord Mandelson had set up a PR company, like an advice company.'  

Mr
 Edis said: 'There was going to be coaching for your appearance on TV, 
because it would be broadcast as select committee proceedings sometimes 
are. Did that happen at Enstone Manor?'  

But Brooks replied: 'We didn't do any of the TV prep because things changed on the Friday.'  

She
 was hoping to spend July 16 and 17 with Lord Mandelson ahead of the 
select committee hearing on July 19, but cancelled the session after she
 resigned on Friday July 15, the court heard.
