The fastest man alive has revealed the secret to his success: fast food.

Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt says he ate 100 McDonald's chicken McNuggets a day at the 2008 Olympics.

During his ten days in Beijing, he estimates he downed 1,000 McNuggets as he set three world records, earned three gold medals and dashed onto the world stage.

Favorite food: Bolt estimates he downed 1,000 McDonald's chicken McNuggets during his 10 days in Beijing - eating two boxes of 20 for breakfast and dinner and one for lunch

Bolt writes in his new book, Faster Than Lightning, that he found Chinese food 'odd,' so he bounded over to the nearest McDonald's and ordered his favorite food, the New York Post reports.

'At first I ate a box of 20 for lunch, then another for dinner. The next day I had two boxes for breakfast, one for lunch and then another couple in the evening. I even grabbed some fries and an apple pie to go with it,' Bolt says.

By that estimation, Bolt was consuming 4,700 calories, 295 grams of fat and 9,000 milligrams of sodium every day - and that's not counting dipping sauces.

Chicken nuggets have recently been the subject of scrutiny from nutritionists and food scientists.

A recent study by University of Mississippi researchers analyzed the components of chicken nuggets from two national fast food chains and found that each one was less than half chicken muscle meat.

Researchers found that the nuggets contained large amounts of bone, cartilage, fat, nerves and organ linings.

Bolt says he had a 'don't ask, don't tell' relationship with his longtime girlfriend Mizicann Evans after he rose to international fame and women began 'throwing themselves at him'

The researchers didn't name the fast food chains from which they bought the chicken nuggets in question.

In 2003, McDonald's came out with all white meat McNuggets after they were branded 'a McFrankenstein creation' by a federal judge.

U.S. chicken McNuggets came under scrutiny again in 2010 when it was revealed they contain butylhydroquinone, a petroleum-based preservative tertiary, and dimethylpolysiloxane, an anti-foaming agent also found in Silly Puddy. Experts say the chemicals are used in only trace amounts and are not harmful.

Bolt also revealed in his book, due out tomorrow, that after becoming an international superstar women began throwing themselves at him.

He says he developed a 'don't ask, don't tell' policy with his then-girlfriend, fellow Jamacian runner Mizicann Evans.

He writes: 'I was able to get any lady I wanted... I could walk into a party and take my pick. I would go into a club and think, "Hmm, a’ight, which one? You . . . ? You . . . ? Oh, you! Let’s do this."'

The couple has since split up.

Bolt's record-setting moves on the track might be all his own, but his signature celebration moves were actually dreamed up by a friend.

His 'Bolting' dance, in which he pulls back an imaginary arrow and fires it into the heavens, was the idea of a dancer friend from Jamaica.

'I’d made a deal that if I won the 100, I would bust some crazy dance move. It was called "Di World,"' the sprinter says.
