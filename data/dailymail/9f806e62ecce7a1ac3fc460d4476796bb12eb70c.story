A creepy statue of Steve Jobs has been selected out of more than 10,000 to honor the late Apple founder out the front of the tech giant's headquarters.

A miniature version of the structure - the real thing will be up to 16 feet tall - was showcased Monday in Belgrade, on what would have been Jobs' 59th birthday. It was immediately met with a barrage of criticism from Apple fans, some of whom described it as 'the stuff nightmares are made of.'

Crafted by Serbian sculptor Dragan Radenovic, the statue, which will call the company's Cupertino, California, base home, comprises Jobs' head on a panel of what appears to be steel.

The panel then has bizarre protruding features - one is of the Latin letter 'A,' another is the last letter of the Serbian alphabet and resembles an 'E' and the Cryllic letter at the bottom that is similar to 'W,' according to Mac Rumors.

The other characters are '0' and '1' to represent the binary numerical system, the artist told Serbian publication Netokracija.com.

Radenovic won the international art competition, which received more than 10,000 entries.

He claims the panel is somewhat of a magnet for the numbers and letters, perhaps representing the way Jobs' was able to talk people around to his way of thinking and attract then with his ideas.

The sculptor also said he wanted to present some 'recognizable motifs' from his homeland.Â

According to a report in the Serbian media, sketches of the proposed artwork were sent to Apple executives were enamored by sketches of the artwork, saying they were very interested in it and liked 'the imperfections of (Radenovic's) work.'

They thought other designs were too computer-centric, Apple Insider reported.

But while even Apple designer Jony Ive himself loved the sculpture, scores of Apple fans, used to clean lines and bold colors, voiced their disapproval on Twitter.

One user tweeted: 'Apple's Steve Jobs memorial statue design is the stuff nightmares are made of. Creepy.'

Another wrote: 'For someone who had a great eye for excellent, pleasing design... this... is... this... uh. hmm. No.'

It is believed the full-size sculpture will be built on the company's campus if given the final thumbs up.
