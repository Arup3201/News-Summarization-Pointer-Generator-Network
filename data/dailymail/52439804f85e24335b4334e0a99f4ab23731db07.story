These soggy dogs have become an internet hit after starring in a photographic exhibition of pooches in the bath.

New York photographer Sophie Gamand, 33, created the project called 'Wet Dog' and the results have now gone viral.

The goofy portraits show just how expressive man's best friend can be in the tub, as they grimace and scowl at the lens, while being soaked to the bone.

Some of the pooches even end up looking like famous people from history including Albert Einstein and Andy Warhol.

Social standards: Sophie said the project is about the way we alter our dogs' appearance 'to fit standards of hygiene and beauty'

Sophie, who shot the dogs in collaboration with pet stylist, Ruben Santana, says: 'In these pictures the dogs become timeless sculptures.

'The way the water plays with their hair in a very painterly manner, and their facial expressions as the water is poured on them creates striking portraits.

'I wanted to explore the bond between dogs and humans, and let the dogs take charge.
