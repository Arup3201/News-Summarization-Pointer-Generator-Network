Leighton Meester shot to fame as the queen of the Upper East Side, Blair Waldorf, in cult hit Gossip Girl.

Her on-screen best friend Serena - played by Blake Lively - has gone on to land some huge fashion and beauty campaigns and now Leighton looks set to give her a run for her money.

The 27-year-old actress has been unveiled as the new face of skincare brand Biotherm.

And keen to show her looks aren't thanks to caking on cosmetics, the actress has opted for a more natural look in the campaign imagery.

Speaking about her new role, Leighton said it was 'empowering' to pose without hiding behind make-up.

She added that she 'feels very lucky to be part of the brand', perhaps alluding to the fact Blake has stolen much of the Gossip Girl spotlight.

Patrick Kullenberg from Biotherm said Leighton was 'an obvious choice' to represent them because of her 'natural talent, energy and beauty'.

While Leighton may be unknown to people who aren't fans of Gossip Girl, that could all change in 2014 as she's set to star in a number of forthcoming films.

She will star in The Judge opposite Robert Downey Jr and Robert Duvall, Life Partners opposite Adam Brody and Like Sunday, Like Rain alongside Debra Messing.

When she's not working, Leighton says she likes to tap into her other creative side: music.

She first crossed into the musical 
realm as a singer/songwriter in 2009 with an electro pop sound that has 
since evolved toward folk.

Last
 year she toured the U.S. as lead singer for acoustic folk group, Check 
in the Dark, and has used her vocal talents in a number of her on-screen 
performances.
