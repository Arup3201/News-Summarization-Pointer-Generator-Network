Google may have mapped some of the most remote regions on Earth, but outer space remains a vast and dark mystery.

Now one Canadian app, named SkyWatch, is hoping to give space the ‘Google Maps’ treatment by plotting cosmic events in real-time for amateur astronomers.

Using raw data from Nasa, the app displays events such as supernovas and comets,on a Google Maps interface and highlights them as they happen.

SkyWatch is hoping to give space the ‘Google Maps’ treatment by plotting cosmic events in real-time for amateur astronomers. The Toronto-based team came up with the app during Nasa’s International Space Apps Challenge and is currently working on a prototype. An early version of the design is pictured here

The Toronto-based team came up with the app during Nasa’s International Space Apps Challenge and is currently working on a prototype.

‘When we were first conceptualising SkyWatch, we aimed to build a tool that simply “opened up the heavens” to the seven billion-plus here on Earth,’ said developer James Slilfierz.

‘As the product developed we began to realise an even greater potential: one that allowed children to witness spectacular events millions of light years away at the exact same time as Nasa scientists, a privilege never before recognised.’

The Skywatch app is powered with data from Nasa’s Gamma-ray Coordinates Network. 

The data from this network reveals the coordinates of celestial events as they happen in space.

After learning the physical location of the cosmic event, a Google Maps interface is combined with Google Sky Map to come up with a real-time visual map of space.

An algorithm is used to to pick out interesting features, such as supernovas, which are visually mapped on the app.

The app is powered with data from Nasa’s Gamma-ray Coordinates Network. Scientists input data they want to share with other scientists and the servers send out the data to other telescopes in various locations.

SkyWatch aims to use that data in a ‘Twitter-like platform where people all over the world can follow what is happening in the skies at all times.’

Without an astrophysicist on board, the team spent a large proportion of their time trying to find out what the telemetric data collected from Nasa meant, according to a report in Motherboard.

After find out the physical location of the event, the Google Maps portion of the app is paired up with another Google product: Google Sky Map.

The team combine Sky Map’s interface with telemetric data from Earth to come up with a real time visual map of space.

Dexter Jagula, the team project leader told Motherboard users experience the ‘celestial event in space... as close to real time as we can.’

The team have now created an algorithm is able to automatically track events that people are interested in.

Mr Jagula believes visually replicating space events in real-time is vital to promoting space research to a younger generation.

The team hopes to have a working app available ‘sooner rather than later’ for mobile platforms.
