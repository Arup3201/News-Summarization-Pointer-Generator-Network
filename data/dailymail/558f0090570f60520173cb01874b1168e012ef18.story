Shoppers watched in shock as a bus driver performed a one hundred and forty point turn in an narrow city street.

The number 11 double-decker was on its way to the Sprowston area of Norwich when roadworks meant it had to change course.

Pedestrians, drivers and even the passengers on board were left astonished as the driver shunted the vehicle back and forth to turn it around.

Shopkeepers waved the driver back and forward to help him complete the manoeuvre in the city's Magdalen Street.

Tight spot: A bus driver attempts to turn his vehicle around in Magdalen Street, Norwich yesterday

The incident happened yesterday following the start of work on Monday to modify a junction in the city meant the area was closed to traffic.

The driver's bosses at the locally-based First firm said the driver ended up in a fix after reading 'no access for any vehicles except buses' on road signs.

Chris Gosbell, owner of pawnbrokers Long's Pledge Center helped the driver try and reverse after it hit the sign outside his shop.

He said: 'I went out to try and help him to make sure he didn't reverse into the building. He said thanks for helping him out. I felt for him a bit.'

Local businessman Andy Manley, a director at Norwich Computers in Magdalen Street, filmed the bus as it tried to turn back down Magdalen Street.

He compared the multi-point U-turn to the manoeuvre attempted by Austin Powers on a cart in the 1997 film starring Mike Myers.

Mr Manley said 'There was another car turning round and the bus came over to the left, turned round and before you knew it there were people trying to help the driver reverse it.'

A spokesman for First said they will remind their drivers about the diversions in the area following yesterday's incident.

'We can confirm that one of our buses drove along Magdalen Street on Tuesday, January 27 as the diversion signs were placed to read "No access for any vehicles except buses".

'We issue staff notices to all of our drivers in advance of roadworks, advising them of the diversion and the diversion route. However, in instances like this, our drivers obey signage on the roads.

'We will remind our drivers about the diversions and apologise for any inconvenience caused.'

A city council spokesman said the 'signs would be adjusted to remove any ambiguity'.
