This is the moment a drunk prankster had to be rescued after got stuck in a harness dangling from a footbridge for an hour and a half.

Lee Bassett, 29, climbed over the railings in Plymouth, Devon, and into the harness for 'a bit of a dare' last month.

But his friend was unable to lift him back over the bridge and the emergency services had to be called to rescue him.

Lee Bassett had to be rescued from a footbridge where he dangled for an hour and a half, stopping traffic

Roads had to be closed and the cost of the emergency is believed to have cost the taxpayer £5,000.

Prosecutor Will Rose told Plymouth Magistrates' Court:  'Spiderman, Mr Bassett is not. As a 
result of this dangerous and reckless act Gdynia Way had to be closed as
well as roads in the nearby area.

'Mr
Bassett apologised for his actions. It was an acutely foolish, reckless
and dangerous act causing great concern to motorists and pedestrians 
and was resolved at great expense to the public purse.

'As a result of this bizarre prank it costs the public purse £4,875.'

Bassett, of Plymouth, Devon, pleaded guilty to causing danger to road users and will be sentenced on March 11.

The court heard the operation to rescue Bassett cost police £1,800, the ambulance service £675 and the fire service £2,400.

Bassett, 29, clambered over the edge of the bridge above passing cars 'after a few jars' for 'a bit of a dare'

The court heard Bassett 'had had a few jars' and 'did it for a dare' and told police on the scene: 'It was supposed to be a joke - it's a bet that went wrong.'

He told police he had put the harness on himself and lowered himself over the railing.

Once swinging there, a friend was supposed to bring him up - but his friend wasn't strong enough to lift him.

Bassett's solicitor said he 'wholeheartedly regrets the matter'.
