With its green spaces, pavilions and cafes, this planned redevelopment of the Manhattan waterfront looks like any other city regeneration project.

But in fact the plans have been designed with a far more serious goal in mind – to protect the island and its 1.6 million residents from a repeat of the devastation wreaked by Hurricane Sandy in 2012.

The 10 miles of parkland and public open space that skirt in a U-shape around Manhattan will in fact be used to camouflage raised barriers and deployable walls that will be essential to battle rising waters in the event of a storm.

The project by Danish designers, the Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG), aims to create a protective ribbon around lower Manhattan, shielding buildings from flood and storm surges.

The Dryline project created by the Bjarke Ingels Group, will provide a protective ribbon around the banks of Manhattan to protect it from flooding

The aptly named Dryline has been brought to life in a new animated video produced by London based Squint Opera. 

It shows how the Manhattan coastline will be defended from floodwater by use of a series of berms or raised shelves. 

Deployable walls, clever planting, kiosks, sport areas, cycle routes and walkways have also been incorporated into the scheme that will defend the city.

When fully completed the ambitious project will  run from West 57th Street, down to The Battery park and up to East 42nd street.

'You won't see it as a flood wall that separates the life of the city from the water,' Bjarke Ingels told Dezeen.

This is the Bjarke Ingels Group's long term vision for the Bridging Berm, which will be transformed as part of the first phase of the scheme

Phase one: The Bridging Beam will create vistas over the Lower East Side of Manhattan that visitors will be able to use  to relax, socialize and enjoy river views

There are also plans for outdoor public pools, similar to the harbour baths in Copenhagen, to be incorporated into the proposals on 10th street as part of the Bridging Berm

Alongside the Bridging Berm a new scenic cycle way will be created for bike riders to enjoy on the banks of the Manhattan shoreline

'When you go there you'll see landscape, you'll see pavilions, but all of this will secretly be the infrastructure that protects Manhattan from flooding.'

Hurricane Sandy left parts of New York in ruin when it battered the US eastern seaboard in October 2012, damaging 305,000 homes and leaving in its wake $19 billion worth of destruction .

The Dryline was one of six winning projects chosen as part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Rebuild by Design competition.

In fact, BIG was the only company to bid to create flood defences for Manhattan.

'It was a bit like going to a big dance,' Mr Ingels, told the Guardian.

'No one picks the pretties girl because they are all a bit shy.' 

In total $920 million was allocated to the winning schemes across the Sandy-affected regions of New York, New Jersey and New York City.

The Dryline was said to have been inspired by New York's High Line - an elevated park built on 2.5 kilmetres of disused railroad tracks transformed into a park.

There are also now proposals to create the world's first underground park, known as the Low Line, in an abandoned trolley terminal below the Lower East Side.

As part of the Dryline project, original called the Big U, the design team interviewed residents and local business owner's to ensure their plans would benefit the local communities.

As a result the defences may take the form of a grassy knoll in one area, but public community space in another.

'We're doing it in a way that will be in dialogue with all the neighborhoods along the Big U, so that what we're doing will never be perceived as a war zone, or a piece of resilience infrastructure,' Mr Ingels previously told Wired.

 'When you go there in the future you will see amenities that are tailored to the neighborhoods. Undulating landscapes, street furniture, pavilions, that are part of an environmental and social program.' 

The project is set to be completed in three phases.

The first phases, has been granted $335million funding from HUD, and will redevelop the Lower East Side.

It will involving raising a 15ft tall bridging berm that will cut through East River Park and provide a barrier to protect low-lying ground, according to the Guardian.

The Dryline project also features plans for swimming pools, aquariums, pavilions, and parks

The scheme, created by the Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG), has been created with the help of local communities

When fully completed the ambitious scheme will create new public open spaces running from West 57th Street, down to The Battery park and up to East 42nd street

The design includes open spaces and sports areas that people will be able to use in good weather

Bjarke Ingels said: 'When you go there you'll see landscape, you'll see pavilions, but all of this will secretly be the infrastructure that protects Manhattan from flooding.'

Spanning a mile-and-a-half long, the earthen berm will provide a 'robust vertical protection' from future storm surges and rising sea levels.

It will also offers   accessible routes into the park and provide space for relaxing, socializing, and enjoying views of the park and river. 

Between Manhattan Bridge and Montgomery Street deployable walls will be attached to the underside of the FDR Drive, ready to flip down to prepare for flood events.

The panels will be decorated by local artists and provide a colourful ceiling above the East River Esplanade when not in use. 

The east and west boundaries of The Battery, that were key inlets during Hurricane Sandy, and led to the flooding of Lower Manhattan and close down the financial district.

According to the plans by BIG - in partnership with ONE Architecture, Starr Whitehouse, James Lima Planning + Development, Level Infrastructure, BuroHappold, Arcadis, Green Shield Ecology, AEA Consulting, Project Projects and the School of Constructed Environments at Parsons - a berm and a series of knolls will not just provide protection, but also a place where people can sunbath, farm and garden.

Fishing piers, an aquarium, swimming pools and pavilions are also said to feature in the 10-mile long scheme.  

The first phase of the project could be completed within in five years, New York mayor Bill de Blasio  told the New York Post last year.
