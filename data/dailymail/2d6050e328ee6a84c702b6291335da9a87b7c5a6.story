'Jilted': Karen Orchard arrives at Truro Crown Court accused of trying to kill her former partner and her best friend by allegedly running them down in her car after they started an affair

A jilted mother tried to mow down and kill her former partner and her best friend after they began an affair, a court heard today.

Karen Orchard, 40, drove her people carrier three times at Geoffrey Richards and Rosanna Vanhorn after she spotted them walking hand in hand in the village of Lizard, west Cornwall, it was alleged.

Truro Crown Court was told that minutes afterwards she sent a text message in which she wrote: 'I have just tried to kill them.'

She also condemned Ms Vanhorn, who had been her best friend, in the same text, which was recovered by police from her phone.

Orchard, a mother of two, wrote: 'You were right as usual about sweet, little, innocent Rosanna, f****** b***h.'

She claimed that she was the ‘latest of at least three women’ whose men Rosanna had ‘muscled on in’.

Orchard denies charges of attempted murder against both Mr Richards, 41, and 35-year-old Ms Vanhorn as well as alternative charges of attempting to cause GBH with intent and two further counts of dangerous driving on January 21 this year.

Prosecutor Llewellyn Sellick told the jury: 'The defendant learned that her ex partner Geoffrey Richards, known as Gof, had started a relationship with a friend of hers, Rosanna Vanhorn, and she decided that she would kill them by running them over in her car.'

The jury heard Orchard and plumber Mr Richards split up last Christmas but he had not told Orchard about his new relationship with Ms Vanhorn.

Mr Sellick said on the night in question Orchard saw the couple hand in hand in the village and drove her car at them, forcing them to jump out of the way.

He said she had her hand on the horn continuously as she drove at the couple.

Mr Sellick said: 'They jumped out of the way, had they not jumped they would have been run over.'

Mr Richards said the first incident - in his evidence - was more ‘to scare’ them.

But 20 minutes later they returned to Ms Vanhorn’s Peugeot car and found that it had been rammed forwards by Orchard’s vehicle and yellowy orange paint and excrement had been poured over it.

The police had been called by a local pub landlord and Mr Richards went to see if Orchard was back at her home because Ms Vanhorn was worried about a possible threat to her children and horses.

Mr Sellick said that Orchard then drove at them again, mounting a pavement and striking a concrete bollard that got caught under the front of her car.

The prosecutor said: 'The bollards saved them. Without them they would have been run over.'

The frightened couple ran off as Orchard reversed off the bollard and she then drove at them for a third time.

'Victims': Geoffrey Richards and Rosanna Vanhorn (pictured leaving court) had to 'jump out of the way' to avoid being run over, the jury was told

Ms Vanhorn was on top of a gate about to leap away when Orchard’s car hit the gate which landed on top of Ms Vanhorn.

Ms Vanhorn told the court: 'I was on the floor when the car went through and the gate ended up on top of me.

'Then the car reversed, I tried to get up, but I couldn’t get to my feet, then Geoff grabbed me away from the car as it was reversing, I didn’t see what happened after that.'

The pair hid behind some nearby garages as 
Orchard again reversed her car and drove towards the smashed gate, the court heard.

Mr
Sellick said: 'It is the deliberate driving at these two people which 
we say is attempted murder. We say she intended to kill them.'

The text message also revealed that Orchard had been battling cancer for 12 weeks on ‘ top of all the other sh**’.

She accused Ms Vanhorn of ‘cosying up to Gof knowing full well we had still been sleeping together’.

'I have just tried to kill them': Orchard drove her people carrier three times at Mr Richards and Ms Vanhorn after she spotted them together in the village of Lizard (file picture), west Cornwall, her trial heard

She added in the text: 'I have just tried to kill them. If you hear the rossers (police) they are for me.'

She also wrote that there was nothing left of her life and she felt like jumping to her death ‘but for my girls’.

She branded the pair ‘evil’ adding that they will be ‘glad I am gone’.

After
the series of incidents, Mr Richards rang Orchard and she screamed and 
shouted at him in that call saying ‘this was the final nail in the 
coffin’ and Ms Vanhorn was ‘a bitch’.

He said: 'She said she has done this before to other people. This is the third time she has done it.'

When police arrived, Orchard was at 
home crying and had drunk a little wine to calm herself down and her 
clothes had orange paint on them.

In
a prepared statement to police, she said: 'I totally deny that I 
purposely drove at Gof or Rosanna or tried to harm them. I drove to see 
them.

'I was peeping my horn
to get their attention but before I got to them, they ran off. At no 
stage did I run them over. I wanted to talk to them.'

Truro Crown Court (above) heard Orchard and plumber Mr Richards split up last Christmas but he had not told Orchard about his new relationship with Ms Vanhorn

Mr Sellick told the jury she drove at speed deliberately at the pedestrians and ‘that is clearly dangerous’.

Mr Richards gave evidence and said in the first attempt Orchard drove at them with her headlights on and horn blaring at speed.

He
told the court: 'She drove at us and swerved away. I guess she was 
upset. She swerved away at the last minute about three metres from us. 
We jumped out of the way.

'I don’t think at the time she was driving at us,' he admitted, adding: 'It was more of a scare. It was a bit frightening.'

                            Prosecutor Llewellyn Sellick

He said they met ten years ago when she worked in the local pub and last slept together a month before the alleged incident - and allegedly a month after he and Ms Vanhorn had become ‘friends’.

Mr Richards said after the first incident he did not want to press charges because ‘I did not want to get her into trouble’.

Defence barrister Michael Melville-Shreeve accused Mr Richards of exaggerating the whole incident.

He said: 'All she did was honk her horn at you.'

He said Ms Vanhorn only suffered two minor grazes to her elbows and said it was ‘absolute nonsense’ that she had been trapped under the gate.

Mr Melville-Shreeve suggested: 'We were spotted by Karen Orchard and she honked her horn with some vigour. Rosanna and you were hand in hand together.'

He said the couple ‘nipped off like caught-out teenagers’ when they were spotted by Orchard, who lives in Lizard Village, who only wanted to speak to them.

Orchard, who walks with the aid of a stick because of an ankle injury, denies all six charges against her.

The trial continues.
