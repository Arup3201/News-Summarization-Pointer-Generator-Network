Authorities are conducting a new search on a Virginia mountain for the remains of two Maryland sisters who disappeared in 1975.

The Bedford County Sheriff's Office said Monday that additional leads prompted another dig on Taylor's Mountain in Bedford County, but officials didn't provide details. The operation is expected to take several days. An earlier dig was conducted on the mountain in January.

The sheriff's Office, the Virginia State Police and the Montgomery Police Department in Maryland are conducting the search for the remains of ten-year-old Katherine Lyon and 12-year-old Sheila Lyon.

The girls went missing on March 25, 1975, after walking to get some pizza at the Wheaton Plaza Shopping Center in Maryland and to look at the Easter decorations.  

The Lyon sisters never came home, and a massive search turned up nothing. Parents John and Mary Lyon have never been able to find out what happened to their daughters.

Over four decades, police have pursued numerous leads and periodically identified potential suspects. But they never charged anyone. 

Authorities have, however, named Richard Allen Welch Sr. and his nephew, Lloyd Lee Welch, as persons of interest in the case. Neither man has been charged.

In February it was revealed that Lloyd Lee Welch, a sex offender, told investigators that he left a Maryland shopping mall with two young sisters who disappeared in 1975 and later saw his uncle sexually assaulting one of the girls, according to  police affidavits. 

The Washington Post reported that Montgomery County police, citing the ongoing investigation, declined to comment on the affidavits or how credible they find 58-year-old Lloyd Welch's recent statements.

A week after the girls vanished the then-18-year-old Welch went to Wheaton Plaza (pictured, 1975) and told a security guard that he had seen the sisters leave with a man in a car

Though volunteers searched for the sisters, they came up with nothing. Detectives never found evidence of what happened to Katherine and Sheila or who was responsible

'Our department and our partners in Virginia remain committed to determining what happened to Katherine and Sheila Lyon,' Montgomery Police Chief Tom Manger said in February. 'We believe that there are people, including family members of Dick and Lloyd Welch, who have information that would further this investigation.'

Richard Welch's wife, Patricia, was charged with perjury after testifying before the grand jury in December.

The affidavits released in February did not say whether any incriminating evidence has been found on Taylor's Mountain in Virginia. 

Investigators have found bones on a property near Taylor's mountain that used to belong to the family of Lloyd Lee Welch, according to court papers. 

But that may not mean much because the land contains an old cemetery with more than 30 unmarked graves.

At one point during the search, detectives wrote that a dog trained to sniff decomposition 'alerted' to areas away from the cemetery.

On the day they vanished, the girls' older brother reported seeing them at the mall, and a friend claimed to have seen them talking to an older man who was carrying a microphone and a briefcase.

Lloyd Welch told investigators he left a Maryland shopping mall with two young sisters who disappeared in 1975 and later saw his uncle sexually assaulting one of the girls, according to police affidavits unsealed in Febrary

Authorities have been searching for the remains of 12-year-old Sheila Lyon and 10-year-old Katharine Lyon on a remote mountain in Bedford County, Virginia, some 200 miles from their Montgomery County, Maryland, home, since September

A sketch of that man, who had long hair and a mustache, was created and circulated, but it didn't lead to any arrests.

One person who provided details to a police artist said the man had been 'fixated' on the girls.

Welch, who worked at a traveling carnival with his then girlfriend Helen Craver, had been at the mall and was seen paying attention to the Lyon girls, police chief Thomas Manger said.

The filings detail for the first time how Lloyd Welch surfaced in the case. A week after the girls vanished the then-18-year-old Welch went to Wheaton Plaza and told a security guard that he had seen the sisters leave with a man in a car.

Police gave him a polygraph test which showed he was lying, according to the affidavits, which did not say whether authorities continued to look into Welch.

The detectives on the case in 2013 set out to learn more about Welch, who had been arrested in 1977 in Montgomery in a burglary case.

His mug shot from that arrest strongly resembled a sketch in the Lyon sisters case that had been drawn based on a witness's description of a man at Wheaton Plaza who was staring at the girls and following them, according to the affidavits. 

Their disappearance profoundly changed the Lyon family. The girls' father, John Lyon, became a victims' advocate in Montgomery County and help counsel other families who had lost loved ones

In 1994, he had pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a ten-year-old girl in South Carolina. In 1998, he pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a ten-year-old girl in Delaware and was sentenced to three decades in prison.

The detectives went to Delaware, according to the affidavits, and interviewed Welch several times in prison.

'During these interviews, Lloyd Welch has admitted he left Wheaton Plaza in a vehicle with the Lyon sisters on the day they disappeared,' according to the affidavits, written by Montgomery Detective Mark Janney and Detectives R.D. Baldwin and S.O. Smith of the Bedford County Sheriff's Office.

The affidavits say Lloyd Welch told police Richard Welch was involved in kidnapping the girls. Lloyd Welch said he was dropped off near his home, and the next day he went to Richard Welch's home where he saw the uncle sexually abusing one of the sisters. He said he left and never saw the girls again.

Shelia and Katherine were on spring break when they disappeared. They left their home at 11am and their mother Mary Lyon told them to be home by 4pm. 

Mrs Lyon later said that in the quiet Washington, D.C., suburb, it was common to let children go to the shopping center alone.

As the Montgomery County Gazette put it years later - it was a simpler time when everyone looked out for everyone else's children.

The massive investigation that followed the girls' disappearance brought in countless tips and widespread national and local media coverage.

Potential clues were found, but later discounted. People were brought in for questioning, but later released without charge.

Detectives never found evidence of what happened to Katherine and Sheila or who was responsible.

Their disappearance profoundly changed the Lyon family. Mr Lyon became a victims' advocate in Montgomery County and help counsel other families who had lost loved ones.

The girls' brother, who was 15 at the time they vanished, became a homicide detective when he grew up.

According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, Katherine Lyon was last seen wearing a baby beads necklace with orange beads and 'KATE' in black letters on white beads and dirty beige brushed suede wallaby type Jumping Jack shoes with dirty beige shoelaces.

Sheila Lyon was last seen wearing farsighted gold wire rimmed glasses, low cut GallenKamp sneakers, size 6.5 or 7.5, with dirty white shoestrings, and knee socks. Katherine has a birthmark on the inside of her upper thigh.

The organization also created age-progressed photographs of the sisters. Sheila Lyon would now be 52 and Katherine Lyon would be 50 years old.
