A former TSA agent has revealed more odd rules from the world of airport security - including the time his co-worker told a passenger her goldfish was allowed on a flight, but its water could not travel.

Jason Edward Harrington, writing for Politico, defended his decision to blow the whistle on TSA checkpoints earlier this year, and revealed more insider details from his time as an agent.

On one occasion, Harrington said a passenger and his colleagues got into a 'heated' debated about whether or not mashed potatoes count as a liquid - concluding that they should be classified as a gel and therefore banned from travelling through security.

Overreaction: Harrington has continually sought to lay the blame for airport security frustrations at the feet of TSA bosses, not frontline staff

In his post, Harrington described the mixed response he had to his earlier revelations, with some TSA agents thanking him for criticising TSA bosses rather than frontline employees for the problems.

But some felt Harrington's anecdotes about his former co-workers still read as an attempt to smear junior staff.

'They were angry that I seemed to place responsibility for the agency’s problems squarely on the shoulders of low-ranking employees, rather than focusing on upper management and underlying organizational problems,' he said.

Harrington also revealed that he has been warned that intelligence agencies are likely to be monitoring him after he blew the whistle on TSA practices.

'My ex-husband is now a senior executive at the NSA at Fort Meade... The NSA will probably track you,' Harrington recalled being told.

Part of the process: Since 9/11 air travelers have experienced many different requests from TSA agents, and passengers are used to taking off their shoes as they approach security

In January Harrington wrote his first article for Politco - 'Dear America, I Saw You Naked'.

In the piece he detailed the strange rules he'd had to enforce - including telling a now-disabled young soldier on his way home from Afghanistan that the celebratory bottle of champagne he was carrying was a risk to national security.

The following month Harrington revealed more rules issued by TSA bosses in an article for Time, including making agents confiscate aluminum foil and ink cartridges, and a 2012 government memo warning that terrorists were plotting to use 'solar powered improvised explosive devices' on airplanes.

Harrington has continually sought to lay the blame for airport security frustrations at the feet of TSA bosses who he says overreact to everyday items - such as banning tin foil specifically in case a passenger decides to use the serrated edge as a weapon.

Problem? One TSA boss demanded that aluminum foil was taken away from passengers, fearing that the serrated edge on the box could be used as a weapon

At the start of February, U.S. security chiefs warned of a possible terror plot using explosives hidden in tubes of toothpaste during the Olympic Games and liquids were banned from carry-on luggage.

The ban on liquids, gels, aerosols and powders in hand luggage applied to all non-stop flights from the U.S. to Russia, where the 2014 Winter Games was being held.

Harrington has previously recalled managers who wanted to have agents fired for chewing gum - in case their attention span was reduced and their 'defences down' while chewing.

In 2010, the TSA faced ridicule and anger from business passengers for banning the transport of ink and toner cartridges after a terrorist plot was thwarted in Yemen.

At the time a statement from Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano was issued, reading: 'No high risk cargo will be allowed on passenger aircraft.

'Toner and ink cartridges over 16 ounces will be prohibited on passenger 
aircraft in both carry-on bags and checked bags on domestic and 
international flights in-bound to the United States.'
