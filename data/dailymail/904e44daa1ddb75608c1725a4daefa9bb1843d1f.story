Nearly four tonnes of health and 
slimming supplements containing endangered plants and animals - from 
rhino horn to rare orchids - were also impounded last year

Rhino horns, tortoises and big cats, pinned butterflies and boxes of Detonate bodybuilding supplements - these are just some of the items being smuggled into Britain, according to border officials.

On one shelf in a secret warehouse is a tiny stuffed tortoise, looking like a toy; nearby a 
larger marine turtle imported through Dover as a souvenir, its insides 
hollowed out.

The Home Office has revealed that more items were confiscated between April 2012 and April 2013 than in any other year.

Other contraband included £4,000 shawls made of Tibetan antelope wool and books bound in elephant hide.

Grant Miller, the senior officer on the Border Force team, said: 'We have everything from rhino horn to ivory to the taxidermy items and marine species that we see being brought back into the UK, both in passengers' luggage - but more importantly, and in large quantities, through freight.'

Seizures of illegal ivory in Britain has increased almost 25-fold in the last two years fuelled by demand from China's growing middle classes. Above, Senior Border Force officer Grant Miller holds an ivory tusk among the seized items

Last year, 80.7kg (178lb) of endangered elephant tusk was confiscated by border agents at Heathrow - worth tens of thousands on the black market - compared to just 3.3kg (7.2lb) in 2010. Above, an ivory figure made from the tusk of a young elephant

In total, more than 2.5 million illegal items were seized last year - worth tens of millions - compared to 250,000 in 2011  

Items are confiscated at the border under the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES).

The
 2012/13 year saw 690 items seized - up from 509 the previous year - and
 included 3,890kg of medicine containing extracts of endangered species,
 326 ivory items and 93 live animals.

In
 the climate-controlled warehouse, shelves overflow with items 
waiting for CITES experts to see if they fall under the treaty.

Jan Sowa, who works with the CITES team, said: 'I'm not surprised by anything any more.'

 compared to just 3.3kg (7.2lb) in 2010.

Mr Miller (pictured above with big cat skulls) said the dramatic rise in seizures was not due to domestic demand but new wealth in China and the Far East

Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: 'Organised criminal gangs will smuggle anything if they think there is a profit to be made and animal products can be worth millions of pounds on the black market'

Nearly four tonnes of health and slimming supplements containing endangered plants and animals - from rhino horn to rare orchids - were also impounded last year

This
 figure is likely to represent only a small fraction of the ivory that 
is being illegally poached in Africa, which is then transformed into 
intricately carved jewellery and decorations for Chinese buyers keen to 
exhibit their wealth.

Nearly four tonnes of health and 
slimming supplements containing endangered plants and animals - from 
rhino horn to rare orchids - were also impounded last year, as illegal 
imports increased more than seven-fold in just 12 months.

The lucrative smuggling trade also 
involves live animals, with 466 endangered Hermann’s tortoises seized at
 Heathrow Airport this month. 

Other
 exotic animals rescued in the past year include a Geoffroy’s cat, two 
King vultures and a tayra, a weasel-like mammal from south America.

In
 September, Foreign Secretary William Hague warned the illegal trade in 
wildlife is now worth $19billion (£11.8bn) globally, and ‘the profits 
from the trade pose an increasing threat to security by funding criminal
 gangs and terrorism’.

Officials said most seizures were small packages of illegal goods sent by courier from Africa to Asia, normally weighing less than 15kg (33lb), which are seized as they transit through hubs like Heathrow

The illegal trade of ivory is growing globally, with an estimated 17,000 elephants poached in 2011 alone

Although the international trade in 
ivory was banned in 1989, customs officials are intercepting increasing 
amounts each year as they pass through Heathrow.

In total, more than 2.5 million illegal items were seized last year - worth tens of millions - compared to 250,000 in 2011.

One
 of the confiscated items includes a piece of artwork consisting of an 
endangered Fischer’s lovebird sitting on a grenade, valued at £8,000.

Senior
 border force officer Grant Miller said the dramatic rise in seizures 
was not due to domestic demand, but new wealth in China and the Far 
East.

‘It is driven by human greed, particularly consumer demand in China and the Far East. People now have money they can spend, and ivory and rhino horn is seen as a status symbol - it allows them to show off their wealth,’ he said.

‘Increasing economic activity of Chinese in Africa is also to blame, as it gives them direct access to ivory.’

Officials
 said most seizures were small packages of illegal goods sent by courier
 from Africa to Asia, normally weighing less than 15kg (33lb), which are
 seized as they transit through hubs like Heathrow.

He added: ‘Chinese workers in Africa buy small amounts with their wages each month to sell at a huge profit back home.’

The illegal trade of ivory is growing globally, with an estimated 17,000 elephants poached in 2011 alone.

Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: ‘Organised criminal gangs will smuggle anything if they think there is a profit to be made and animal products can be worth millions of pounds on the black market.

‘The fact that this trade is contributing to the threat of extinction faced by many endangered species is of no interest to these ruthless traffickers.

'Border Force’s specialist officers are world renowned for their excellence in identifying and preventing the trade of illegal animal and plant material.

‘Officers are working tirelessly with partners in the National Crime Agency, the police and internationally to stamp out this illicit trade.’ 

Mr Miller said the biggest shift has been in the beauty and fitness industries, where endangered species once used only in folk medicines are being sold as bodybuilding supplements and facial creams.

He added: 'The market is evolving - there is more demand from a wider set of consumers.

'From the traditional Chinese medicine products that we used to seeing, we're now seeing new age beauty products, the health and fitness slimming pills, that are having endangered species within their ingredients.'

While much of the trade is in rising Asian markets like China and Vietnam, Britain's position as a global logistics hub means CITES goods often come through its borders.

This year 500kg of face cream containing caviar extract were discovered being imported from China, while 126,000 pots of Detonate and 15,120 of CRAZE - bodybuilding supplements containing the rare orchid Dendrobium - were seized en route from the US.

In May, a Manchester man received six months in prison for trying to import 750kg of live coral from Vietnam.

Mr Miller also cited the seizure of 2.3 tonnes of Indian Red Sandalwood on its way to Hong Kong as 'carpets and Indian handicrafts'.
