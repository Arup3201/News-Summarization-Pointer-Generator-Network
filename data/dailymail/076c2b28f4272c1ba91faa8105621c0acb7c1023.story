For 90 years, his rifle over his shoulder, he stood guard at the war memorial.

Now the bronze statue of the First World War soldier has been stolen.

The 2ft figure – known locally as Jimmy – was taken from the war memorial in East Wemyss, Fife, on Tuesday.

'Cold and callous': The plundered bronze statuette, pictured right - affectionately known as Jiimmy - was taken from a war memorial in East Wemyss, Fife, left, that bears the names of soldiers killed in serving their country

¿An absolute disgrace¿: George Gill in front of the town war memorial now missing its statue of a Great War rifleman, the vacant spot is circled in red

The memorial, erected in the 1920s, is inscribed: ‘In memory of the men of East Wemyss who fell during the Great War.’ 

It bears the names of 70 local men 
killed  in the First World War, 28 who fell in the  Second World War Two
and one name that has been added since.

Sacred: The 2ft figure - known locally as Jimmy - was taken from the war memorial by scrap metal thieves

Local
Labour councillor Jim Young, whose uncle’s name is on the monument, 
said: ‘This is a war memorial. Some things should be sacred. To steal it
is a cold and callous thing to do.

‘This memorial means a lot to the people of East Wemyss.

'My
own uncle, Robert Young, who served in the Royal Navy and was killed in
the Second World War, is on  the memorial – and there are many other 
families who are shocked.’

The statue was stolen previously, in 
the 1990s, but was eventually recovered from a scrapyard in the North of
England and bolted back in position.

Local man George Gill, 70, of the Black Watch Association, said: ‘It’s an absolute disgrace.

Targeted: The statue was stolen previously, in the 1990s, but was eventually recovered from a scrapyard in the North of England and bolted back in position

Lest we forget: The names of those who died fighting for their country and are commemorated on the war memorial in East Wemyss, Fife

'When we got it back in the 1990s,  pins were put into the stone and the statue, Jimmy as we know him, was bolted down – so it would have taken quite an effort to remove him again.

‘Whoever has stolen it will be lucky to get £100 for the bronze but it’s not about the monetary value.

'This memorial belongs to the village. It has huge sentimental value to people here.

‘If they still have it, if they could just return it back to the village, it would be most appreciated.’ 

A Police Scotland spokesman confirmed the force was investigating the theft of the statue.
