A tax could be put on fizzy drinks and biscuits could be emblazoned with health warnings in a new strategy to slash the nation’s sugar intake.

A report commissioned by a Government agency says that targeting soft drinks would be an easy option in the war on sugar.

It estimates that a 20 per cent tax on fizzy drinks – which would raise the price of a can from 70p to 84p – would cut the number of overweight Britons by more than a quarter of a million.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is under pressure to hike fizzy drinks' cost to tackle the growing obesity crisis

The leaked paper, which was written by heart doctors and health researchers, comes just weeks after the Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies warned that a ‘sugar tax’ may be necessary to tackle the country’s obesity epidemic.

Figures show that British girls are the fattest in Europe, with almost a third overweight or obese. Around two thirds of adults are overweight or obese.

The ‘options for action’ document, which was prepared for Public Health England, identifies six possible ways of reducing sugar intake: a tax on sugary drinks; foods being reformulated to contain less sugar; a cut in portion sizes; advertising rules being tightened; health warnings on  sugary products; and encouraging farmers to grow fruit and vegetables instead of sugar beet.

The draft report describes sugary soft drinks as ‘low-hanging fruit’ – or an easy target – and says a 20 per cent sugar  tax would reduce obesity rates by 1.3  per cent.

It argues that the move would have public support, ‘especially when health benefits are emphasised’.

The paper, obtained by The Grocer magazine, is expected to form the basis of a report to be published on June 26.

Public Health England said the Government had asked for its advice but any decision would lie with ministers.

The Department of Health said it currently had no plans for a sugar tax.

Coca-Cola Life (left), is a new naturally-sweetened drink with a third less sugar and calories than regular fizzy drinks  and will be launched in the new year. But health campaigners say people need to learn how to enjoy drinks that do not taste sweet - whether loaded with sugar or sweeteners - because at the moment we are 'drinking spoonfuls of sugar', as the shock image on the right represents

A
 can of Coca Cola or Pepsi contains nine teaspoons of sugar - or 35g. 
This is almost half of the maximum recommended daily intake of sugar

Our diets could be improved by listening to the right kind of music, scientists claim.

Researchers from Oxford University claim high-pitched tones trick the brain into thinking a food is sweeter than it really is, while low notes enhance bitter tastes.

They said a dish could be made to taste up to 10 per cent sweeter through ‘sonic seasoning’, meaning less sugar was needed.
