Nigel Pearson is hoping Leicester City can take their relegation fight to the final day where he has a remarkable record of success.

The Leicester manager has twice before worked last-match miracles in charge of teams in trouble and would love the opportunity to complete a hat-trick.

‘Of course I would. I’ve been in plenty,’ said Pearson.

Leicester, rooted to the bottom of the Premier League and seven points from safety, look to have bleak prospects of reaching that stage still in contention to avoid the drop. The draw against Hull was a significant opportunity missed.

But Pearson has history of achieving the improbable. In his first manager’s job at Carlisle he masterminded one of the most famous last day survival acts when goalkeeper Jimmy Glass struck decisively with the last kick of their Division Three season in 1998-99.

Nine years later Pearson was brought in to take charge of Southampton, struggling in the Championship, and guided the team to safety with a last-gasp victory. He was also Bryan Robson’s assistant when West Bromwich Albion stayed up against the odds in the final game of the 2004-05 Premier League campaign.

He is aware Leicester, without a Premier League victory in eight games, must start wining soon to have any chance and he was disappointed with his team’s display.

‘It’s another opportunity lost against a side who we needed to pick up three points against,’ he said. 

‘In some ways I’d stomach us losing the game being more positive trying to win it, than picking up a point having been a bit safe. Time will tell whether that is the right way to look at it or not.

‘(The gap) is a lot at this stage of the season. We’re going to have to turn our form on its head. The point is we’ve got to perform. The players know we haven’t done enough to win the game. I would like to have seen us show a bit more intent.’
