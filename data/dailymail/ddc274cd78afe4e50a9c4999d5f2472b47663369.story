Raheem Sterling has wasted little time on his return from the World Cup as he is already back in the gym for pre-season training.

The Liverpool winger only landed back in the UK with the England squad on Wednesday following their group stage elimination in Brazil.

But he has started his preparations for next season instantly, posting a photo on Instagram showing him in the gym.

The photo was accompanied with the caption: 'Early morning gym time to prepare for next season.'

Sterling will be disappointed that he is not still out in Brazil but, following back-to-back 2-1 losses against Italy and Uruguay, England were knocked out after only two matches.

They drew 0-0 against Costa Rica in their final Group D match and that solitary point gave them their worst return in a World Cup since 1958.

Sterling, 19, starred for Liverpool last season as they narrowly missed out on the Premier League title, scoring 10 goals in 34 appearances.
