A football match was called off after just 58 seconds when the referee realised he could not see his linesmen due to intense fog.

The top-of-the-table clash between St Austell and Bodmin in Cornwall on Wednesday had already been delayed due to poor weather when referee Neil Hunnisett decided to get on with the game.

But it was called off less than a minute later, making it one of the shortest games in football history.

A top-of-the-table clash between St Austell and Bodmin in Cornwall on Wednesday had to be called off after just 58 seconds due to intense fog which blanketed the pitch

Referee Neil Hunnisett had already been forced to delay the game due to the poor weather, and was keen to get on with the Carlsberg South-West Peninsula match, but eventually had to concede defeat

Local league official Mike Sampson said: 'When we arrived in St Austell it was hard to see out of the windows. I had to put my glasses on to eat my pasty.'

He added: 'We only knew the game had kicked off because the whistle went. The linesman put his flag up and it took the referee 58 seconds to see him.'

Home team St Austell said they would refund all 150 fans who turned out for South West Peninsula League game.

Mr Hunnisett defended his decision to start the game and claimed: 'I've officiated in worse. I wanted to see if the fog would clear.'

He told BBC Radio Cornwall: 'I could have called the game off when I got to the ground.

'My two assistants and assessor went along with my decision to start. However, just prior to kick-off it was very apparent I had probably made the wrong decision.

'Do I feel bad? Of course I do. I was looking forward to this game as it's a big appointment and I am aware that St Austell have a bottleneck of fixtures too.'

Mr. Sampson added: 'The fans were very good about it. St Austell refunded all their money and everybody was very good about it.

'It was a very important game in the league.

'St Austell's games are piling up, they'll be playing three or four times a week come the end of the season, so to be fair to the referee he tried everything he could to get it on.'

Local league official Mike Sampson, who came to watch the match from the touchline, said he only knew the game had started after hearing the referee's whistle as he couldn't see the centre circle

This game is not the quickest to be called off, as a 1998 World Cup qualifier between Scotland and Estonia finished after three seconds when the Estonian team boycotted in a row over floodlights

St Austell, who are through to the semi-finals of the FA Vase, are fourth in the league and have eight games in hand on leaders Saltash United, who are 13 points ahead.

The game is expected to be rearranged in April.

However this game was not the quickest-ever to be called off. A 1998 World Cup qualifier between Estonia and Scotland was abandoned after three seconds 

The Estonia team boycotted the game due to a dispute over the floodlights at the Kadrioru Stadium in Tallinn.
