Helena Costa, a Portuguese coach nicknamed ‘Mourinho in a petticoat’, has made history by being appointed as the first woman to manage in the top two divisions of a major European league.

The 36-year-old, formerly head coach of Iran’s national women’s team, will take charge of French second tier side Clermont Foot at the end of the season, replacing Regis Brouard.

Costa met Jose Mourinho at Benfica, where she coached boys teams from Under 9 to Under 17. She then served an internship with Chelsea’s Academy and women’s sides in 2005 during Mourinho’s first spell at the club.

Her intense will to win drew comparisons with the Chelsea boss, prompting Costa to be tagged ‘Mourinho in a petticoat’. She has since gone on to work as a scout for Celtic and gain respect as a coach in her own right in both the men’s and women’s games.

As 
recently as 2010, Costa said she did not expect to see a female managing
 a professional men’s team for at least another 60 years.

‘Working
 in professional football is a dream for me,’ she added. ‘It will not 
happen quickly - maybe for my great-grandchildren. But I did not go to 
the end of the world to train to give up.’

Clermont
 defender Jacques Salze said club president Claude Michy had already 
called several key players telling them to trust and respect his 
decision.

But Salze claimed there would be ‘no revolution’ since the club already has a female physiotherapist, Severine Chapeyron.

‘The
 physio sees us in our underwear all day!’ he said. ‘This appointment 
does not change much. After we take our shower I do not think she 
(Costa) will be there.

‘Our
 coach has absolute authority. It’s like with your boss, you have to 
respect him or her. It will be weird to some, but I do not mind. There 
will be no revolution.

‘She is a woman, but she is a coach, and will remain a coach.’

The Clermont players were told on Wednesday morning before training.

Striker Remy Dugimont told L’Equipe: ‘It is a surprise, a big surprise. It came out of nowhere but it is good: it will create a buzz and will be a unique experience.

‘I’m not macho. She has worked in the profession and all the boys know how it works. At first it will be a little weird but it will only last a few days.’

Defender Anthony Lippini added: ‘I spoke with the physio about the first time a woman entered the army. It was a very macho environment.

‘Now there are many women in the army and it may be the same in football. I cannot wait for next season to discover. I’m really curious.

‘It will be a unique experience to be the first professional football team in France to be managed by a woman.’

Costa, a UEFA ‘A’ licensed coach, took Portuguese side Cheleirense to the Lisbon Regional Championship in 2006.

She remembers having to ‘change the whole mentality in a town where women still had a very submissive role’. She was eventually dismissed for ‘lack of results’ with the team topping the district championship table.

Veronique Soulier, president of Clermont Foot’s supporters’ club, said: ‘It surprised us, but we all believe that it is a good thing.

‘The boys in the team can be difficult to manage. They can be quite sensitive, that is what the other coaches have told us. With a woman in charge, maybe they will be less demanding.’
