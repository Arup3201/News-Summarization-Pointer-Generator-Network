A former soldier spent six months out of work after hitting a pub punchball machine so hard it severed tendons in his hand.

David Forster, 32, scored a respectable 900 points out of 1,000 when he struck the arcade machine at Sam Jack's pub in Newcastle with a savage right-hander.

But the impact split his hand from finger to wrist and severed tendons - leaving him permanently disfigured and unable to work for six months.

Now the former Coldstream Guard is suing the bar for £8,000 in damages for the injury.

He said: 'As soon as I made contact with the punch ball my hand split open and there was blood everywhere.

'I tried to stem the flow by running it under the toilet tap but as soon as the water was on my hand, the pain was excruciating.

'I had only been out for a few hours and had a few pints so I was gutted that I had to end my night and go to hospital.'

Mr Forster, a father of one, was out with friends on a stag night in Newcastle city centre when the incident happened at around 8pm on 18th June last year.

The game tests players' mettle by measuring the power of a punch thrown at a padded ball suspended from the machine.

Lawyers
for the pub claim Mr Forster was drunk and stumbled, missing the punch 
ball and hitting the metal framework holding it in place.

But Mr Forster's legal team claim CCTV footage prove he made contact with the punch ball and walked away.

He
was taken by ambulance to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle 
where he needed 12 stitches and a metal plate in his hand.

Mr Forster, of Newcastle, spent five days in hospital after contracting an infection and needed plastic surgery to rebuild his hand.

His fiancee Donna Bell, 31, nursed David while he had physiotherapy, two times a week for up to four months.

Mr Forster, who now works as a security guard for the JobCentre added: 'I am battling for some form of compensation for my loss of earnings.

'I was out of work for six months and nearly lost my house because I was struggling to pay the mortgage.

'I will always have problems with my hand now and worry that I can no longer defend myself.

'I used to box in the army and play football a lot - I can't do any of these sports anymore.'

Managers at Sam Jack's pub said they were unable to comment on Mr Forster's claim.

Managers of the pub where David Forster damaged his hand on a punch ball machine said they were unable to comment on his claim.

Bob Senior, managing director of Utopian Leisure group, said: 'I am unfamiliar with this incident personally. All incidents are passed on to our insurance company who deal with them.  

'This is the usual procedure we follow and part of our insurance conditions. I can make no further comment.'
