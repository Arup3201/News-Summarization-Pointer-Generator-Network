The French Press greeted Paris Saint Germain's extraordinary victory over Chelsea with euphoric acclaim on Thursday morning, lauding Laurent Blanc's men as 'heroes' and delivering a withering assessment of the 'cynicism' of Jose Mourinho's team.

L'Equipe's match report proclaimed the dramatic 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge as a 'magnificent, incredible, heroic night…' and adding that 'the performance of PSG should take pride of place among the pantheon of the Parisian club's most glorious nights, awakening memories of magical victories against Real Madrid in 1993 and Barcelona in 1995'.

For Chelsea, the assessment was damning. The French media believe that Mourinho was responsible for the red card delivered to Zlatan Ibrahmovic after only 31 minutes for a challenge on Oscar. Chelsea have been broadly criticised as nine of their players surrounded the referee in the immediate aftermath of the incident.

L'Equipe write: 'It was an incandescent minute, which saw Mourinho benefit from all that he has grown to embody through his years of experience on the European scene…he flaps his arms, harangues, gesturing frantically in the direction of the referee Kuipers'.

Chelsea's lethargic showing was panned by L'Equipe in the ratings, with the respected French daily awarding only 3/10 to Branislav Ivanovic, Oscar and Diego Costa. Only Gary Cahill and Thibaut Courtois were awarded marks higher than 5/10, with L'Equipe handing sixes to the pair.

The Spanish forward Costa is the centrepiece of the spread, poetically described as a 'demon without wonder'. 

The newspaper continues: 'Diego Costa wears within him a natural anger which always leaves him on a knife-edge. By looking to wind-up opponents, by constantly confronting them, sometimes head-to-head, he creates an electricity and we await the spark. Last night, it never arrived. As his centre forward, he has been provoked a lot by Mourinho but now he has forgotten to play.'

PSG were viewed rather more generously, and their valiant performances were hailed in the match ratings, with the returning David Luiz awarded a 9/10, and L'Equipe described him as the 'perfect example…demonstrating that he can remain concentrated defensively.'

Marco Verratti, the brilliant Italian technician, received an 8/10, praised for 'setting the tempo of the match' and his 'huge impact' on the game. Ibrahimovic, harshly sent off after only half an hour, was not given a mark while Edinson Cavani, who missed a guilt-edged chance in the second half, was handed a 4.
