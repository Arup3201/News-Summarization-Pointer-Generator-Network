Irving Diaz, who was pictured in June embracing a woman and grabbing her rear, has received another complaint against him after a female in 'short shorts' was spotted behind the wheel of his authorized vehicle

It is not clear whether it is the same woman involved in each incident. 

Guzman-Phillips was described as being 'scantily-clad' and wearing short shorts at the time, the Florida Times Union reported. 

The manager at the restaurant said she didn't work there.

According to an internal affairs report, he explained his choices were just a 'bad mistake' 

The investigation also revealed that Diaz had checked the woman's name in a database to check if she had any outstanding warrants to her name.

Just two days before Guzman-Phillips is said to have driven the car again.

The husband of Diaz's ex-wife, Jonathan Potter, was dropping Diaz's children off for a scheduled visit when he saw the 24-year-old get out of his vehicle and run into the house, again wearing 'short shorts'. 

Diaz admitted to investigators that he allowed Guzman-Phillips to drive his patrol car twice in October.

According to the report is explanation was that he had made a 'bad decision'. 

The internal affairs department handed him two counts of improper action and one count each of unbecoming conduct,.

The counts added to repeated infractions of unbecoming conduct, in relation to the photograph taken earlier last year, and improper use of computer software.

'The investigation and discipline speak for itself,” Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Melissa Bujeda told the paper. 'There will be no other statement in reference to this incident.'

According to rules laid down by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, officers must not be seen 'engaging in sexually motivated physical contact or other verbal or physical conduct or communication of a sexual nature.'
