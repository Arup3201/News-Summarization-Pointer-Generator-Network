A man has been jailed for six months for stalking ex-EastEnders actress and anti-knife crime campaigner Brooke Kinsella.

Paul Mason, 44, was found guilty at a previous court hearing when magistrates heard he bombarded Brooke, 31, with text messages including one which said 'you will be my wife'.

He also turned up at an office to present her with gifts and got to hug her when she appeared at a public event at Millwall Football club.

Brooke became a high profile figure after her brother Ben Kinsella was murdered in a gang knife attack in 2008.

She met government ministers and went on TV and radio to lead her fight for more measures to tackle knife crime.

But the actress did not welcome the bizarre attentions of unemployed Mason who stalked her.

Last November Bexley Magistrates Court was told he nicknamed her 'pumpkin' and kept messaging her on Twitter and Facebook.

Once he even visited her brother's grave.

The court heard he had four previous convictions for harassment.

Mason, from Catford, south-east London, obtained Brooke's phone number through a website and text messaged her saying: 'Your wedding dress is ready pumpkin.'

He also said: 'Pumpkin, I will be coming down Saturday to see you and the kids' - in reference to the True Stars Academy, her performing arts school for children in Hoxton, east London.

When he was arrested on April 10 last year, police found a poster of her on his bedroom wall and a series of hand-written love letters on his bed.

Brooke, who gave evidence from behind a curtain in court, said she asked for Mason's messages to be blocked from the Facebook page of the Ben Kinsella Trust which was set up to educate schools on knife crime.

But Mason continuously set up new Facebook accounts which Abigail Kegg, manager of the trust, recognised due to the personal nature of interactions sent.

In August last year, Mason attended the charity's offices where Brooke was working to give her perfume, a ring, oils, a scarf and numerous CDs containing his own recordings.

But he was met by Miss Kegg who confronted him on his relationship with the actress.

She told Mason: 'I don't think Brooke is expecting you, I don't think she wants your gift and I don't think she is your friend.'

Mr Mason, pictured, had four prior convictions and was sentenced to a maximum jail term of six  months    

Giving evidence, Miss Kegg told the court how at this point Mason lifted his shirt and showed her a 'huge scar' on his stomach he claimed was the result of being stabbed several years ago.

Miss Kegg told Mason she would accept the gifts on Brooke's behalf on the condition he left.

On another occasion in April, an open day was arranged at Millwall Football Club where Mason approached and hugged the actress who subsequently informed a police friend and sought advice.

During the trial, an erratic Mason lifted his shirt to caress his scar, mumbled to himself in the dock and tried to take evidence claiming the love letters he wrote were part of his autobiography.

Mason was found guilty of stalking.

Sentencing him to six months' jail, magistrate Alan Dee told him: 'Mr Mason you understand you did not plead guilty to this offence and therefore we needed to have a trial.

'But of course in the process of a trial the victim needed to relieve the memory of the memory of offences when coming to court to give evidence.

'We have taken into account the previous history of harassing individuals. We have also concluded that you have been calculating in your conduct.

'The court will know the maximum sentence we can impose is 26 weeks.

'However for the non violent nature of these types of offences the range is usually 12 weeks, that would be the normal sentence we would impose.

'However we have to take into account other evidence, we have to take into account the prolonged nature of this offence and the impact on Miss Kinsella and those who worked with her.

'She would not have known when you would turn up and the impact on the others who worked with her.

'Let's also take into account your previous record is not good and there are four previous harassment convictions since 2008.

'On that basis, we have concluded that the period of custody we must impose today is the full 26 weeks.'

Mr Dee ordered him to pay an £80 victim surcharge.

Mason, who wore a grey tracksuit and appeared via video link, shouted at Mr Dee: 'I don't give two shits' - before he was taken away by guards.

He also ranted that he had been stabbed and that his mother died from being stabbed.

Mason was also subject to a restraining order.

He is prohibited to go to Finsbury library in London, not to enter N1, London, not to knowingly attend any location that Brooke Kinsella is at and not to contact her directly or indirectly.

Brooke played Kelly Taylor in EastEnders between 2001-2004. Her character was a friend of Martine McCutcheon's character Tiffany Raymond in the BBC1 soap.
