It could be the bedroom of any toddler, with a pink cot in the corner, strewn with teddy bears and a cosy quilt. 

Elsewhere stacked on shelves are nappies, wet wipes, Sudocrem and baby powder while frilly princess dresses and baby-grows hang in the wardrobe. 

Yet this is no child's room, it's a pay-per-hour retreat for fully grown adults who love to pretend to be babies.

Clients of Nursery Thymes can pay £350 for a 12-hour stay sometimes overnight in this oversized cot

Derek Ventham, who dresses up as an adult baby and runs Nursery Thymes with his wife Maxine, was featured in a 2012 Channel 4 documentary called The 15-Stone Babies 

Nursery Thymes is run by so-called adult baby Derek Ventham and his wife 'Mummy Maxine', who charge grown adults to regress back to an infant-like state in which they wear nappies, have books read to them and even experience a 'nappy change'.

But the pair - who recently moved to Bootle, Liverpool, from Portsmouth where they were attacked and branded 'perverts' by neighbours - insist there's nothing weird about their business.

Maxine said: 'It's not portrayed very well normally. We want to get the message out that we are not freaks and perverts and it is just an alternative lifestyle that we really enjoy. That's it.

'It's for people who want to be cared for and it takes them back to a more innocent time when they didn't have to worry about paying bills or mortgages.

'We have people coming from cold countries and hot countries and all over the UK.'

Derek and Maxine have catered to those with paraphilic infantilism or adult baby fetishes for 14 years and featured on a Channel 4 documentary called The 15-Stone babies in 2012.

People from around the world travel to the adult baby nursery to wear nappies and have them changed

Maxine insisted  many adult babies found their passion after difficult childhoods, like  Derek who made the discovery at the age of seven.

Men who share Derek's fetish yearn to be absolved of any of the responsibilities of modern life, and say that the swapping of taxes for toys and commuting for cuddles simply helps them relax. 

Adult babies can play with soft toys and colourful building blocks or sit in nappies and watch television or eat in specially-sized high chairs.  

Customers are charged £75 and hour to play with toys, have nap time in adult-size cribs and dress up in nappies. 

There is also a £25 surplus charge for a nappy change, which can be 'messy'. Staying overnight costs £350 with extra charges for night-time nappy changes. 

The Nursery Thymes website also offers 'breast suckling' for a £25 charge.  

'Mummy' Maxine will care for clients, changing their nappies, reading them stories and conducting bath time 

Derek told the Liverpool Echo that the controversial fetish is nothing to do with sex.

He said: 'As soon as you mention adult babies, they say "you're a paedophile". But it couldn't be further from the truth. We don't want to be with children, we want to be the child. This is my relaxant. Half an hour in a nappy, and my stress is gone.'

In fact, Maxine - who says a client once told her she was an 'English geisha' - compares her business to a spa day.  

'You go somewhere and someone wraps you in a nice, cosy towel and you have everything done for you. You just relax, you don't have to think about anything, or do anything for that afternoon.

She added: 'Yes, I'm changing their nappies and touching an intimate area - but that's where it stops.'

She reads her clients stories and oversees bath time, making sure there are lots of bubbles. 'It brings so much happiness to me and them,' she said.

But she can't explain what causes adults to get a thrill from pretending to be a small child again.

She said: 'It's like any fetish, it's just a part of you and you have a feeling for something and don't know why. Sometimes it relates to things when the client was young and it takes them back to childhood.

Adult babies can play with soft toys or dress up in frilly pink and white children's outfits

The Nursery Thymes website says, 'Nurserythymes is a safe place. So let your baby side go free and be good or naughty!

'I taylor [sic] your stay to what you want. Play in the nursery or sit and watch Television in the

living room. Wait for your meals sitting in the bright coloured high chair.

'Sleep soundly in the cot with as many soft toy.'

The website also says that for Maxine and Daddy: 'Looking after babies is the one thing we enjoy doing most, be it feeding hungry mouths or reading a bedtime story to send our little ones off to sleep. Our goal is to ensure you get the most out of your stay. 

The pair say 'all kinds of people' use their service including same-sex couples, male and female couples and one client has his personal assistant make the appointments for him.

They cater to electricians, doctors and students and have seen a recent growth in clients under 25 as the use of the internet and mobile phones changes the way people can find out about them and get in touch. 

Derek even offers to pick clients up from the train station for a £5 fee or from the airport for £10. 

They offer to take British adult babies on trips to Disneyland in Florida to meet other adult babies in America. They have just returned from a trip with an adult baby girl from Liverpool.

'It's just about people who enjoy being cared for and looked after. It's a lovely lifestyle,' said Maxine.
