These insects may look like aliens from space, but they are in fact close-up images of butterflies taken in a garden.

Bulging eyes stare out from either side of an intricately curled antenna as they are caught in spectacular detal

Each of the varying colours of the delicate and tiny feathers can be seen - from crisp whites to golden yellows and pitch blacks.

These insects may look like aliens from space, but they in fact they are huge blow-ups of beautiful butterflies taken in a garden. Each of the varying colours of the delicate and tiny feathers can be seen - from crisp whites to golden yellows and pitch blacks

The photographs were taken by IT worker Iwan Pruvic, in the comfort of his back garden in Tangerang, Indonesia.

The 32-year-old sat just 4 inches (10cm) away from the butterflies, patiently creeping closer to the insects to capture every detail of their decorations.

His images capture a variety of the 20,000 species that are found across the world.

Mr Pruvic said: 'I took some photos in the afternoon but quite a lot were at night when the butterflies were not active or moving.

Mr Pruvic said: 'I love butterflies but when you look closely at them and take shots like this, it's almost like seeing an alien species. They're so strange but beautiful, up close'

Butterflies use a 'sun compass' in their antenna to help them make their 2,000 mile migratory journey to overwintering sites. 

During the absence of daylight cues, migrants have been, surprisingly, seen flying in the expected southerly direction.

It’s been suggested they use geomagnetic cues to help navigate when day light cues are unavailable to them during migration.

Tests in the simulator revealed that the butterflies used the inclination angle of Earth’s magnetic field to guide their movement.

'This is the time when they are easier to approach and I could get as close as possible without spooking them.'

Each of the butterflies are adults, varying in size from three to seven centimetres when measured from their heads to their tails.

Despite the delicate feathers almost covering their huge eyes, the butterflies have exceptionally good eyesight.

The antennae protruding from the centre of their heads curl beautifully, and take a different style depending on the type of butterfly.

Indonesia is a hot bed of biodiversity for plants, insects and animals. Despite only covering 1.3 per cent of the Earth's land surface, the country boasts 10 per cent of the world's flowering plant species.

It has 12 per cent species of world’s mammal, 16 per cent species of all reptile and amphibian, 17 per cent species of the world’s bird, and more than 25 per cent of the world’s fish species.

The country is also ranked first in the world for the amount of swallowtail butterflies it has with a total of 121 species already identified.
