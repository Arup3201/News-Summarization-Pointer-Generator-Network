Arsenal star midfielder Aaron Ramsey met Hollywood actors Samuel L Jackson and Alexander Skarsgard after the epic 2-2 draw with Manchester City at the Emriates on Saturday.

The Welshman posted a picture of Instagram with the caption ‘Met two film icons after the game today,@samuelljackson and Alexander Skarsgård’.

Samuel L Jackson, a Hollywood legend from films such as Pulp Fiction, and Alexander Skarsgard from series True Blood, were treated to a fine match before meeting Arsenal players.

Ramsey wasn’t at his inspirational best for the Gunners on Saturday, perhaps due to picking up an ankle injury on international duty for Wales, but would have been impressed by Arsenal’s resilience.

Samuel L Jackson and Skarsgard also posed for a picture with the home squad in the dressing room after the match and another with Arsenal forward Lukas Podolski, who didn’t feature in the contest by remaining on the Arsenal bench.
