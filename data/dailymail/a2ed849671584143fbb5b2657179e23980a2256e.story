Whitney Houston's mother has told how she forced her daughter into rehab after finding the singer's home had been turned into a drug den.

As the first anniversary of the superstar's death approaches next month, Cissy Houston is still traumatised by her drowning in a Beverley Hilton hotel bath at the age of 48

But in her memoirs, Remembering Whitney, her mother admits: 'She started partying and she didn't really know how to stop. I used to wonder what she was doing at night, where she was.'

According to the extract obtained by People Magazine, Cissy continues to ask herself: 'Could I have saved her?'

In a serialisation in the Sun, she 
first realised her daughter had problems when she arrived unannounced at
the mansion in Atlanta, Georgia, Whitney shared with her husband, 
singer Bobby Brown, and their daughter Bobbi Kristina.

Cissy,
79, had been called by her son Gary in early 2005 warning her: 'Ma, I 
think Nippy [the family's pet name] is really in trouble.' He travelled 
everywhere with the singer.

Inside,
the multi-million house was filthy, but Cissy's biggest shock came when
she saw 'big glaring eyes and strange faces' spray painted on the walls
and door.

Concerned: Cissy Houston went to a court to get her daughter into rehab

Cissy recalled: 'Evil eyes staring out like a threat. Who would do such a thing it seemed crazy. It was beyond disturbing to seeing my daughter's face cut out like that. It was frightening.'

In her memoirs, Remembering Whitney by Cissy Houston, due to be published by Harper and Collins (£18.99) on January 31st, she tells how her daughter yelled at her and refused to come downstairs.

Cissy said her daughter looked as if she was on drugs and did not recognise the woman who was a worldwide star with many Grammy music awards and acclaim as an actress.

She left the house but vowed to save Whitney, returning with a court order and two women police deputies. The petition had been signed by eight people and a doctor who had seen the singer in the past 48 hours.

When they arrived, Whitney and Bobby Brown were at the doorway. She was shaking as Cissy told her they were taking her into rehab.

Whitney was in hospital for a week , 
but banned her mother from visiting telling everybody who came to see 
her that her mother had had 'her locked up.'

In
2006 she broke up with her husband but she never really forgave her 
mother's interference in her life, according to the memoirs.

In
an interview with Oprah Winfrey to be broadcast on Monday, Cissy, a 
singer in the 60s and 70s, reveals how Gary told her in a phone call of 
her daughter's death at the Los Angeles hotel on February 11 last year.

She
said: 'I was getting annoyed because he wasn't telling me anything. He 
was screaming. He was saying, Nippy, Nippy. I said, "what's wrong with 
her?'

He said, 'Mommy,' I said, 'Is she dead?' He said, 'Yeah, Mommy, she's dead.' And I don't remember too much else after that.'

In the People magazine extract she said: 'I'm angry she died alone, in those conditions.'

Cissy says she doe not blame Houston's ex-husband for the star's drug addiction.

'I
blame him for the way he treated her, but I don't blame him for her 
drug problems,' she is quoted as saying. 'He was no help to her at all.'
