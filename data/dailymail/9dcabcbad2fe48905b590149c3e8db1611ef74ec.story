She's famous for her penchant for all things high street and it seems the Duchess of Cambridge's thrifty approach to shopping also stretches to designer buys.

The future queen was spotted rummaging through the rails at the Bicester Village outlet centre in Oxfordshire on Sunday and according to staff, snapped up a bargain pair of pyjamas for Prince George.

Afterwards, fellow shoppers took to Twitter, where they described themselves as 'chuffed' and 'overexcited' to find themselves indulging in a spot of retail therapy alongside the Duchess.

Thrifty: The Duchess loves a high street buy and has worn this Hobbs dress twice in the last monthÂ 

'Chuffed to bits,' tweeted a delighted Leah Byrne. 'I met Kate Middleton today, had a little chat and she was lovely!'

Another, Laura Isabella, added: 'Still quite overexcited about exchanging smiles with Kate Middleton this morning!'

'Kate came in on Sunday on her own, just like anyone else, and browsed the sales racks,' a shop assistant added in an interview with the Sun newspaper.

'At first I didn't recognise her - I couldn't believe it was Kate. She was very friendly and I was starstruck to be honest.'

During her visit, the Duchess was seen picking up a pair of pyjamas for Prince George in Lacoste, before scouring the sales rails in Reiss - a perennial favourite of hers.

Popular: Bicester Village designer outlet is a favourite of the Duchess because 'everything is so contained'

Bargain buy: This M Missoni coat-dress was picked up in Bicester Village's Missoni designer outlet store

Other stores visited included Ralph Lauren, Bonpoint and Gucci where she spent more than 30 minutes picking through the discount bags and clothes.

Sunday's visit isn't the first time that the Duchess has been spotted hunting for bargains at Bicester Village either.

During the 2012 tour of the Far East, Kate told Singaporean journalist Sadiah Bte Shahal that she 'loved' Bicester because 'everything is so contained'.

Pieces snapped up during shopping trips to the outlet store include her blue M Missoni coat-dress, which she wore first to a wedding and then for an engagement with the Duchess of Cornwall during the Diamond Jubilee tour in 2012.

So popular did the petrol-blue tweed coat prove among Duchess of Cambridge fans, the brand reissued the piece.

Not that the delighted staff at Bicester Village were prepared to reveal what she bought this time. 'We never comment regarding her visits,' a Bicester spokesman said when approached by MailOnline for comment.

'Yes, obviously she has been here in the past.'

Lucky boy: Prince George, seen here in his birthday portrait, got a pair of pyjamas from the shopping trip

Second time: The coat had been worn to a wedding shortly before the 2012 visit to Nottingham with the Queen

Stylish: Following the appearances, Missoni reissued the coat following huge demand from Kate fans
