A woman who wrote that she loved life just days after taking part in the horrific torture, rape and murder of a young couple has been refused parole just two years into a 35-year sentence.

Taking 90 minutes to reach their decision, the parole board panel turned down Vanessa Coleman's request to be released two years after she was jailed for the killings of Channon Christian and Christopher Newsom.

Coleman, 26, will not be eligible for parole again until 2020, the longest amount of time possible, because of the severity of her crime. 

Vanessa Coleman was refused parole today, two years after she was jailed for her role in the murder, rape and torture of a young couple

Channon Christian, 21, and Christopher Newsom, 23, underwent horrific rape and torture before they were killed in 2007

She was convicted in 2012 for her role in the torture slayings of Miss Christian, 21, and Mr Newsom, 23.

The couple, from Knoxville, Tennessee, were carjacked and abducted as they left a friend's house party in 2007 by Coleman and four men - Letalvis Cobbins, Lemaricus Davidson, Eric Boyd, and George Thomas.

Mr Newsom was tied up, raped and shot in the back of the head while his girlfriend watched in horror. He was then dragged to a railway track and set on fire.

Miss Christian's death came only after hours of torture, during which time she was raped and savaged with a broken chair leg.

She was beaten in the head and household bleach was poured down her throat and over her bleeding and battered body in an attempt by her attackers to cover any evidence of the brutality they had inflicted on her - all while she was still alive.

Miss Christian was then hog-tied with curtains and a strip of bedding while a plastic bag was wrapped over her face.

Her body was stashed inside five larger rubbish liners and dumped in a bin, where, according to the autopsy report, she slowly suffocated to death.

While all of the men except Boyd were found guilty of murder, Coleman was found guilty of lesser charges in 2010.

She was re-tried in 2012 because the judge in her case, Richard Baumgartner, had been having sex during breaks from court, as well as buying drugs from convicts.

This time Coleman was found guilty of facilitation of aggravated kidnapping, facilitation of rape, and the facilitation of the murder of Miss Christian, but not of Mr Newsom.

She was originally due parole in 2019, but good behaviour behind bars meant she could go before the board this year.

More than thirty people attended the hearing, but Coleman's parents were the only ones there to support her.

Coleman answered questions about her history but refused to talk about the crime because she is going through the appeal process.

Miss Christian's father Gary was at the hearing and told the parole board: 'I've got a heart that's full of pain, and anguish, and hate, and revenge and I didn't put it there.'

An online petition with more than 322,000 signatures was also shown to the hearing.

Several of the speakers referenced an entry from Coleman's diary, dated three days after the torture, rape and murders of the couple

In the entry, Coleman writes, 'I've had one hell of an adventure since I've been in the big TN. It's a crazy world these days! But I love the fun adventures and lessons that I've learned. Its going to be a long interesting year! Ha! Ha!'

Mary Newsom, Mr Newsom's mother, said: 'This is not the thinking of a normal person.'

After her application for parole was rejected, Coleman was given an opportunity to apologise for her actions.

She said: 'I'd like to say I apologize for your losses. If I could have changed things, I would have changed things. But it wasn't in my control. If you grant me parole, I will greatly appreciate it. I have changed so much. I'm not the person I used to be.'
