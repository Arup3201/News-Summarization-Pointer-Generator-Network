Olympic star Rebecca Adlington was photographed on the banks of the river Thames yesterday looking happy and relaxed while promoting Virgin's new broadband service.

According to reports the retired swimmer, 25, has undergone surgery to remove a bump in her nose in recent weeks.

Despite being seen out and about this was her first official appearance since photos of her with her new nose surfaced.

Cheerful: Rebecca lounges around in slippers on Virgin's mobile living room to promote their fastest ever broadband

Rebecca Adlington, who recently had surgery to remove a prominent bump in her nose, is promoting Virgin's new wifi system

Lounging
 around on the banks of the Thames, Rebecca enjoyed the view from the comfort of her very own supercharged mobile Virgin Media living room, complete with sofa, lamps, dog basket and cosy 
blanket.

She even got into the spirit by making herself at home and cocooning her feet in a pair of warm-looking padded slippers.

Rebecca, right, before she had surgery to correct a bump in her nose. She has famously struggled with her appearance.

Rebecca quenched her thirst for speed on London's South Bank where she unveiled the UK's fastest broadband on wheels.

The 800m freestyle world record breaker launched Britain's fastest widely available broadband on Virgin Media's very own fully connected mobile living room.

She enjoyed gold medal speeds of 152Mb and the entertainment on her tablet proved more captivating than the views of the Thames.

The UK's first road legal living room can be connected to Virgin Media's supercharged fibre optic cable network so passengers and passers-by can experience the benefits of superfast broadband and next generation TV.

The living room will now embark on a regional tour around the UK as Virgin Media unveils its new speeds at key locations across the nation.

Rebecca is yet to confirm her nose op, but it is said to have been carried out at a Harley Street surgery. She has famously spoken out about crying 'lots of tears' over her appearance.
