Mama June has shared her top tips for perfecting her favorite pastime - couponing.

In a new trailer for TLC's Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, the 33-year-old reality star suggests organizing coupons in a binder with labels for each individual product, and bringing the binder to the store.

While Mama June uses coupons to score discounts on many things, she says the one item she splurges on most is toilet paper, 'because everybody's got to wipe their ass! I mean, hello!'

Indulgence: While Mama June uses coupons to score discounts on many groceries, she admits the one thing she splurges on most is toilet paper. 'Because everybody's go to wipe their ass! I mean, hello!' she says

Mama June, who often refers to herself as the coupon queen, exchanged vows with her boyfriend, Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson, at her home in Georgia in May.

But her love of couponing seems almost as strong as her love for her family, as she is seen saying in a clip from a previous episode: 'It's even better than sex!'

The trailer shows Mama June and Honey Boo Boo, also known as Alana, painstakingly clipping out coupons and sticking them into their purple binder.

Then they take their tickets to the grocery store, where they scope out the best discounts.

'I think 
the thing that people most ever spend on is probably laundry detergent,'
explains Mama June.

Smart saving: 'There's not a lot of meat product coupons out there these days,' she says. 'So if you can find these, like, staple items, then you can provide that money that you saved to buy your meat'

At the grocery store: While toilet paper is one of her favorite items to buy with coupons, she says that she's actually low on it at the moment, thanks to Honey Boo Boo

'With a coupon you can get the smaller size laundry detergent for like $2
if it's on sale.'

The reality mom then gets confused doing the math, saying: 'Buy four smaller bottles that equal the big bottle, 
you're spending $4 versus $17.'

'The thing I splurge on the most is toilet paper because everybody has to wipe their ass!'

There is one product that Mama June and her gang buy without the help of her coupon collection.

'There's not a lot of meat product coupons out there these days,' she says.

'So if you can find these, like, staple items, then you can provide that money that you saved to buy your meat.'

While toilet paper is one of her 
favorite items to buy with coupons, she says that she's actually low on 
it at the moment, thanks to Honey Boo Boo.

Surprise: The reality mom explains that when she and Sugar Bear went out for their anniversary, Honey Boo Boo and her babysitter decorated the entire house - inside and outside - in toilet paper

Troublemaker: 'I didn't get Mama or Sugar Bear nothin' for their anniversary,' the precocious child, who turned eight on Sunday, says in the clip. 'So I wanted to maker their house very purdy'

The
reality mom explains that when she and Sugar Bear went out for their 
anniversary, Honey Boo Boo and her babysitter decided to decorate the entire house
- inside and outside - in toilet paper.

'I
didn't get Mama or Sugar Bear nothin' for their anniversary,' the 
precocious child, who turned eight on Sunday, says in the clip. 'So I wanted to make their house very purdy.'

Mama June rolls her eyes as she remembers the incident, saying: 'We actually put my whole trash can out filled with 
toilet paper, when I could have used that for six months to wipe my ass 
with.'
