From Coleen Rooney's thick Liverpool accent to Amy Childs' Essex twang, accents are a clear tell-tale sign of where a woman is from.

But according to new research the shape of a woman’s eyebrows reveals where she is from even quicker than her accent.

As brow bars and regional brow trends continue to take off, a study has revealed people can pinpoint where a woman is from by the shape of her eyebrows - before they even hear her accent.

Southerners are braving the thick ‘South’ brow, which has been adopted by celebs such as Keira Knightley, Lily Collins, Cara Delevingne, Lauren Goodger, Amy Childs, Tamara Ecclestone and even the Duchess of Cambridge.

But Debenhams' sales reveal that shoppers int he South prefer a more natural finish to their thicker brows, rather than the very dark brown needed to create the Scouse brow that has been made famous by Liverpool ladies.

Indeed, shoppers in the South are buying 93 per cent more natural-toned brow pencils than their Northern counterparts.

However, sales of eyebrow wax and darker pencils at the department store are far higher in the Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds branches of the department store as shoppers go for the Scouse brow favoured by England football captain’s wife Alex Gerrard and Coleen Rooney.

Irish women prefer a ‘tadpole’ eyebrow - thick and round at the inner corners before going into an immediate thin arch ending with a very thin brow - when they get an in-store beauty appointment.

And sales figures show the Emerald Isle sells the least amount of eyebrow products.

Meanwhile, women from Birmingham and other West Midlanders shape their brows into an almost half circle shape called the ‘happy’ eyebrow, while serious Scots prefer the ‘plank’ - the straightest of the eyebrow shapes.

Women booking appointments in Wales are requesting the ‘soft arched’ brow - favoured by glamorous Welsh export Catherine Zeta Jones.

Sara Stern, beauty director at Debenhams, said: 'The number of women adopting signature brow styles for the region that they live in is so high that it’s like having a brow-o-meter; you can instantly guess what area they are from.

'The Scouse brow is still hugely popular in the north with the likes of Coleen Rooney, but southerners have their own interpretation.

'Instead of the brutal Scouse brow - which is a heavily defined, dark, square and thick penciled eyebrow - Londoners have created their own trend, the 'South brow'. Still opting for big brows, but going for a more natural look, less panto dame.

'Some regions are steering clear of the thicker brows - finding both the Scouse and South brow as terrifying as the vajazzle.

'Women used to pluck, thread and wax their brows within a millimetre of their lives, but it’s now about making a statement.'
