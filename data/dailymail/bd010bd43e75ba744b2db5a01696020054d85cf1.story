Children are to be banned from a city centre under draconian plans to tackle anti-social behaviour.

Critics said the decision to stop anyone under 16 walking the streets of Bangor after dark was akin to something ‘you’d expect in North Korea, not North Wales’.

Police are introducing the curfew, believed to be the first time children have been banned from an entire city centre, to rid the area of yobbish behaviour.

Ban: Children will be banned from Bangor town centre from Monday as police and the council in the Welsh city attempt to tackle anti-social behaviour

The strict rules, which apply between 9pm and 6am from today, mean anyone caught in the forbidden zone over the next six months could be jailed for three months or face a £2,500 fine.

But parents and politicians have criticised the move, which they claim will ‘criminalise’ all young people. Membership of sports groups, youth centres and even churches could be affected, they say.

Nick Pickles, director of civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: ‘The idea you could be fined or imprisoned for walking through the town centre simply because you are 15 and not accompanied by a parent is simply madness.

‘To say that anyone under 16 who is unaccompanied between 9pm and 6am is a criminal is the kind of draconian law you’d expect in North Korea, not North Wales. Criminalising every young person in Bangor – without any need for them to be engaged in any wrongdoing – is an unwarranted and disproportionate intrusion into the civil liberties of thousands of perfectly law-abiding young people.’

One mother, Jo Owen, of nearby Caernarfon, said: ‘My son is 16, our local cinema is 25 miles away. He wouldn’t be allowed to walk from the bus stop with these rules.’

Councillor Nigel Pickavance, chairman of the People of Bangor Community Group, said the curfew was a ‘total over-reaction’.

‘It is totally unjust and a massive over-reaction to do this to young people in the city,’ he said.

‘The police are making out Bangor is much worse than it is - believe it or not this is not the Bronx we are living in.

‘There doesn’t seem to have been any consultation with the local community – everyone I’ve spoken to thinks it is a bad move.’ Banned areas include city parks, public areas and 24 individual streets.

The curfew is being introduced despite claims violent crime has fallen by almost a quarter in the city after a previous measure which led to 110 individuals being banned from the area.

Keith Towler, the Children’s Commissioner for Wales, said imposing a blanket ban was ‘heavy-handed’ and an ‘ineffective way of combating anti-social behaviour’.

‘It demonises under 16s, isolates them from their communities, alienates them from police and spreads the misconception all young people are troublemakers,’ he said.

Speaking on behalf of North Wales Police and Gwynedd County Council, who are jointly introducing the measure, Inspector Simon Barrasford defended the move.

‘Many people are working very hard to improve and regenerate the city centre as well as just wanting to enjoy their daily lives without being intimidated or harassed and I have no doubt dispersal order areas will assist in that endeavour,’ he said.

Last night a ‘Stop the Curfew’ Facebook page had almost 1,000 members.

Tory MP David Jones, a minister in the Welsh Office, said he would be raising the curfew with Mark Polin, chief constable of North Wales Police, later this week.

‘I am concerned we have a measure that is indiscriminately barring a whole section of the population from the town centre,’ he added.
