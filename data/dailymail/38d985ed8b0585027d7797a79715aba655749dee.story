A mother who was five months pregnant  died just yards from her home in a road accident after she went on a short trip to nearby shops.

Stephanie Charles was struck by a vehicle while trying to cross the southbound carriageway of the A90 when she went to get something to eat near her home in Aberdeen.

Her partner Mark Robertson has revealed the mother-of-one, who died at the scene, was five months pregnant.

He said his 'whole world just collapsed' when he found out it was the 'happy' and 'smiling' 33-year-old involved in the crash.

Mr Robertson said he was expecting Ms Charles home when he looked out of the window and saw a lot of cars and people had gathered nearby. 

He said: 'Never in a million years did I think it would be her. The next thing we knew, the police were at the door.

'She was five months pregnant. It really is a tragedy.'

Ms Charles has a 10-year-old daughter and was well-known in the area and was regarded as having a happy disposition. 

Mr Robertson's mother Margaret said:  'We just did not see this coming. Something like this happens and your whole life just changes in five seconds.

'She was such a happy girl. She was happy all the time. She was always smiling and she would do anything for you.

Ms Charles was involved in the accident on the southbound carriageway of the A90 in Aberdeen on Saturday 

'She was just that kind of lassie. She had a room full of things for the baby. She was so excited about it.

'This all just feels like a horrible dream.'

Ms Charles also has three sisters and a brother. 

Her older sister, Pamela, was too upset to talk about the accident, but said she had been left 'devastated' by it.

A neighbour added: 'It's terrible. I just spoke to her yesterday. She was very well known in the area.

'I did hear an ambulance last night but you always hear ambulances. It's an awful road.'

The driver and passengers in the vehicle were not hurt by the accident which happened just after 7pm on Saturday night.

A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: 'A 33 year old female pedestrian has died after being involved in a collision about 7.10pm on Saturday night with a vehicle on the southbound carriageway of the A90 Aberdeen to Dundee road near Nigg Way, Aberdeen.
