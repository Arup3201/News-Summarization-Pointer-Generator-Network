He has found the back of the net for Tottenham on 29 occasions this season, but one goal in particular stands out for England's newest hero Harry Kane.

It arrived on February 7 and proved to be the winner, 86 minutes into a fiercely contested north London derby with  local rivals Arsenal.

It was Kane's 22nd strike of a remarkable season and one he won't be forgetting in a hurry.

Asked what the best goal he has ever scored is in an interview with MATCH magazine, Kane said: 'It'll have to be the header against Arsenal, mainly because of the importance of it. 

'A good goal is where you score it as much as how you score it. That was a big moment in the game and it was my first north London derby.'

The Spurs striker will make his first start for the Three Lions on Tuesday night when he lines up alongside Wayne Rooney for a friendly against Italy in Turin.

Kane scored just 79 seconds into his debut against Lithuania last Friday as England continued their charge towards Euro 2016 with a comfortable 4-0 win.

As well as targeting a place in Roy Hodgson's squad for the tournament in France next summer, Kane also hopes to represent his country on the biggest stage of all.

Asked whether he dreams of playing at the 2018 World Cup, he added: 'Yeah, of course. As a kid, you grow up wanting to play for your country in the major tournaments. 

'It's definitely something I aspire to do. Hopefully I keep improving and when the time comes, hopefully I can play in one.'

Kane has won plaudits for his work-rate  this season but he insists that working hard for club and country just comes naturally to him.

Questioned about why other strikers don't appear to put as much effort in as him, Kane said: 'Ha, ha! That's quite a compliment!

'I think other strikers do, but it's in my personality to work as hard as I can for the team. You'll have to ask other strikers why they don't work so hard.'
