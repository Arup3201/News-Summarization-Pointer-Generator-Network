A fascinating archive of vintage adverts showing the birth of the so-called 'Pimm's party' has emerged to mark the launch of the drink's first new flavour in 190 years.

The adverts date back to the 1950s when the economy took a nosedive after the Second World War and many people socialised at home to save money.

It is thought the marketing team behind the gin-based drink realised this and launched the idea of a Pimm's party as a way to encourage sales of the beverage.

The company sent out leaflets in 1950s to the 1960s which included top tips for the perfect social gathering. The marketing campaign worked and The 'Pimm's Party' soon became popular.

Party suggestions included games such as Flipping The Kipper, where guests were instructed to race paper fish by flapping them with cardboard.

Another was the Match Box Race, in which two rows of people passed a matchbox from their nose to another person's.

Food ideas included Celery Dreams, celery sticks filled with mashed salmon and tuna, and Shrimp Thrills, prawns, eggs, and mayonnaise in pastry.

Other canapes that were popular at the time were 'Double-decker Glories' which were layered sandwiches of chicken, almonds, and pineapple and Cheese Crackers.

Pimm's soared in popularity because it cost just 48 shillings and sixpence for a 75cl bottle which served 14 half pints when mixed with lemonade.Â 

The drink was deemed a perfect accompaniment to small snacks at parties because it was initially invented as an aperitif.

The recipe for Pimm's was created in the 1840s by James Pimm, who was a fishmonger and owner of an oyster house.

He came up with the secret concoction of gin, herbs and liqueurs and served it in a small mug known as a Number One Cup as an aid to digestion.

There were also other variations of the drink made with rum, scotch, brandy, rye, and vodka, but they were later discontinued.

Pimm's has now launched a new flavour, Blackberry and Elderflower, for the first time in nearly two centuries.

It can be served warm and could rival mulled wine this Christmas.

James Pimm created Pimm's as as aperitif to accompany his oysters around 1840

Alia Campbell, an archivist 
at Pimm's, said: 'We believe Pimms was invented in the 1840s and we have
 evidence to show that James Pimm was in business in 1823.

'We
 looked in the London directories and it showed he was a shell 
fishmonger and it is thought that he created Pimm's as as aperitif to 
his oysters.

'There were 
originally six flavours of the drink made with different spirits, the 
number one cup was gin, but they were also made with rum, scotch, 
brandy, rye, and vodka.

'Pimm's
 was also a restaurant chain and I believe the last one to close was in 
the 1950s, about the same time as the launch of the Pimm's party.

'By this point the business was focusing just on the drink - its famous number one cup - and so it was a good way to market the product.

'The adverts we have found in the archive for the Pimm's parties are in the style of leaflets and they give tips on how to have the perfect party.

'They include recipes for nibble-style food to accompany the drink and to serve to guests, which could draw on the roots of Pimm's back to when it was originally an aperitif.

'The leaflets even came with free invitations and coasters to make the perfect party.

'It was quite fashionable at that time to have dinner parties and although women were allowed in pubs, it was still a very male- dominated world.

'Pimm's have now launched the Blackberry and Elderflower-flavoured drink which can be served hot or cold and would be a fantastic alternative to mulled wine.'
