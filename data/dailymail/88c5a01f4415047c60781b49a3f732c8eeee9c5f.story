It is known as the 'Death Star' due to a crater making it look like the Star Wars weapon.

However, astronomers say they are a step closer to solving a mystery that has baffled them for decades about Saturn's moon Mimas.

The moon has an odd wobble - and scientists say its core is is either wonky or awash with water.

The researchers built a detailed 3D model of Mimas using images taken from various angles, and tracked the movement of hundreds of reference points on its pockmarked surface.

Researchers used numerous images of Mimas taken by NASA's Cassini mission to determine how much the moon wobbles as it orbits Saturn.

Cassini was sent to Saturn in 1997 to explore the planet and its many moons, which so far number 62 (53 with names).

It has a tell-tale wobble that is twice as big as expected for a moon with a regular, solid structure.

Mimas is mostly made of ice and has a diameter of 396km. 

The researchers offer two explanations for the wobble: either it has a vast ocean beneath its surface, or a rocky core with a weird shape resembling a rugby ball.

The study appears in Science Magazine.

Its authors are astronomers in the US, France and Belgium, who based their calculations on high-resolution photos of Mimas snapped by theCassini spacecraft.

'After carefully examining Mimas, we found it librates - that is, it subtly wobbles - around the moon's polar axis,' said lead author Dr Radwan Tajeddine, who works at Cornell University in the US.

Apart from these gentle 'librations', Mimas otherwise presents the same face to Saturn throughout its orbit.

'The data suggest that something is not right, so to speak, inside Mimas,' said Tajeddine.

'The amount of wobble we measured is double what was predicted.'

Either possiblity for the interior of Mimas would be interesting, according to Tajeddine, as the moon's heavily cratered outward appearance does not suggest anything unusual lies beneath its surface. 

Cassini was sent to Saturn in 1997 to explore the planet and its many moons, which so far number 62 (53 with names).

Because Mimas formed more than four billion years ago, scientists would expect its core to have relaxed into a more or less spherical shape by now. 

So if Mimas' core is oblong in shape, it likely represents a record of the moon's formation, frozen in time.

If Mimas possesses an ocean, it would join an exclusive club of 'ocean worlds' that includes several moons of Jupiter and two other Saturn moons, Enceladus and Titan. 

A global ocean would be surprising, said Tajeddine, as the surface of Mimas does not display signs of geologic activity.

Like a lot of moons in the solar system, including our own, Mimas always shows essentially the same face to its parent planet. 

This is called a spin-orbit resonance, meaning the moon's rotation, or spin, is in sync with its orbit around Saturn. Like Earth's moon, Mimas takes the same amount of time to spin completely around on its axis as it takes to orbit its planet. 

'Observing libration can provide useful insights about what is going on inside a body,' said Tajeddine. 

'In this case, it is telling us that this cratered little moon may be more complex than we thought.'

Models developed by Tajeddine and co-authors from France and Belgium indicate that, if Mimas is hiding a liquid water ocean, it lies 15 to 20 miles (24 to 31 kilometers) beneath the moon's impact-battered surface. 

At 246 miles (396 kilometers) wide, Mimas is too small to have retained internal heat from its formation, so some other source of energy would be required to maintain an underground ocean.

The researchers note that there is evidence that Mimas' current, elongated orbit could have been even more stretched out in the past, which might have created enough tidal heating to produce an ocean.
