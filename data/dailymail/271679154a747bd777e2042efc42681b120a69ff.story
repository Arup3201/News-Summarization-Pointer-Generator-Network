Thousands of Kings of Leon fans have been put on alert by health officials after a woman attended a Seattle concert while she was contagious with measles.

The Washington State Department of Health has now issued a schedule of all the places the Whatcom County woman, who is in her 20s, visited after contracting the infectious illness.

Health officials have said the woman became contagious on March 26 after visiting a family with the condition who have been linked to an outbreak in British Columbia.

She then went to work at a bakery, visited a petrol station and went to the Kings of Leon concert.

According to the schedule posted online, she also visited a Wasabi Bistro, a Starbucks and a Kmart.

Anybody who was at any of the places listed in the schedule, and who have not been vaccinated or are not sure if they are immune, have been urged to seek a health care professional for advice.

Dr Jeffrey Duchin, chief of communicable disease control for Seattle and King County Public Health, told NPR: 'The reason we're doing this is that it's so highly contagious.

'It can stay in the air for hours after the contagious person has left. If we don't treat these people, the chain of transmission can continue.'

Measles is a highly contagious illness and is easily spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

Measles is a highly infectious viral illness which can lead to serious complications.

The initial symptoms develop around 10 days after a person becomes infected and can include cold-like symptoms, a fever, greyish white spots in the mouth and throat and red eyes and sensitivity to light.

A rash will also appear after a few days, often starting behind the ears. It then usually spreads around the head and neck before spreading to the rest of the body.

Anybody can get measles if they have not been vaccinated or have not had it before. It is most common in children between one and four years old.

Once you have had the condition it is very rare to develop it again because your body builds up an immunity to the virus.

Those who are not vaccinated are able to catch measles simply by walking into a room where a contagious person has been in the last couple of hours, the Washington State Department of Health has warned.

Typical symptoms of measles include fever, cough, conjunctivitis and a rash. Complications are quite common even in healthy people, and about 20 per cent of reported measles cases experience one or more complications.

These can include ear infections, vomiting and diarrhoea, pneumonia, meningitis and serious eye disorders.
