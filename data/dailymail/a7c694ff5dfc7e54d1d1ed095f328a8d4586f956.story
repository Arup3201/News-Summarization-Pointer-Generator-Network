An artist who can only draw in his sleep is hoping to raise £1million by selling his entire collection of work.

Lee Hadwin, 37, places pads of paper around his London flat for the bizarre talent which he picked up at the age of four.

He has drawn numerous portraits of screen siren Marilyn Monroe but most of his artwork is of circle-inspired abstract pieces.

Baffled: Scientists have even examined Lee Hadwin's schoolwork to test if he is lying about the talent

Now the artist, who has baffled scientists with his talent, has decided to sell off his entire collection on eBay and donate half of to the Missing Person charity.

Lee, a self-described 'rubbish' artist when he is awake, has sold sleep pieces for six-figure sums in the past with previous buyers including Derren Brown and Donald Trump.

He is hoping to make £1 million from the sale with £500,000 going to charity.

He said: 'It can happen two-to-three times a week that I get out of bed and draw in my sleep.

'But then then it might be another two weeks before I do it again. I sometimes go away and come back to finish a piece off.

'When I wake up, I know I have done something but I don't know what.

'My partner Clint, who I have been with for 14 years, thought it was a joke at first. He used to wake me up but now he just leaves me to it.'

Lee, who wakes up with horrendous migraines after a night's drawing and is often sick as a result, says it has been a nightmare proving he's not a hoaxer.

Over the years he has been for inconclusive tests at the Edinburgh Sleep Clinic with experts going back over his school work to see if he is lying.

The artist, will put between 80 and 100 pieces on eBay on February 11, added: 'My art is horrific when I'm conscious.

'I have only sold a few drawings over the years and have held off selling a lot because I've been told to hold onto them because they will increase in value.

'But now I have just decided to sell them all for charity.'

Lee, who is originally Welsh and lives with partner Clint, 40, chose the charity after meeting a woman whose sister has been missing for six months leaving her having to look who is looking after her children.
