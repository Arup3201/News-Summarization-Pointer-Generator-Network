Pippa Middleton looked relieved to be back on two feet after a marathon cycle across the U.S.

Her bicycle odyssey ended when she crossed the finish line just after 3am on Saturday in Annapolis, Maryland, 
after covering 3,000 miles in six days, ten hours and 54 minutes.

Her brother, James, and six other men also took part in the challenge. The Middleton siblings were pictured having a relaxed stroll along the waterfront in Annapolis with their teammates before flying home.

Protecting her best asset: Pippa said she kept her famous bottom comfortable during the cycle thanks to a good saddle

The sister of the Duchess of Cambridge wore white skinny jeans and a blue and white striped top.

James walked ahead of her in a green T-shirt and trousers and was still sporting his bushy beard.

The pair and their team had set off from California last week on the 
Race Across America with the aim of crossing 12 states to raise money 
for charity.

They cycled through California, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, 
Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania 
and Maryland.

After finishing, Pippa, 30, who is dating stockbroker Nico Jackson, described the experience as 'brilliant'.

Asked if she had suffered saddle sores, she laughed and 
said: 'It wasn't too bad. I think it was because I chose a particularly 
comfy saddle.

'The hardest thing was the sheer endurance of it and not 
getting enough sleep. We averaged about three hours a night.

'I found cycling at night quite intimidating. There was a few nights when we came across snakes, skunks and deer.'

Sporty siblings: James and Pippa's next challenge is a 6.5km swim in Turkey

She said her legs had been sore for the first few days. 'They were a bit wobbly at first but then I got used to it,' she added.

However, the trip did not go completely to plan. Two of the team's bikes developed 
faults and two support vehicles, including the mobile kitchen, also 
broke down.

There have been
 fatalities in the race in previous years and Olympic legend Sir Steve 
Redgrave, who took part in 2010, broke cheekbones, ribs and a wrist 
after falling from his bike.

Pippa
 and her team was raising money for the British Heart Foundation - which
 has appointed her as an ambassador - and The Michael Matthews 
Foundation, named after a British adventurer who died in 1999, aged 22, 
on Mount Everest.

As of this morning, Pippa has raised £5,088 on her JustGiving page.

But even though the epic bike ride is complete, Pippa and James aren't planning to take a break.

The Celebrate author explains on her Just Giving page how they will next take on a challenge in the water.

She said: 'Shortly after this, we will be heading over to Istanbul to take on the Bosphorus Cross-Continental Race. This 6.5km historical swim crosses two continents - Europe to Asia, across one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.'
