Joe Hart let his frustration get the better of him in Manaus on Saturday when he kicked an advertising hoarding during England's 2-1 defeat to Italy.

In the video below, the England goalkeeper can be seen running behind his goal late in the second half to collect the ball after Andrea Pirlo's stunning free-kick crashed off the bar and out for a goal-kick.

Manchester City stopper Hart screams for the ball as he bids to restart play as quickly as possible, but ends up booting an electronic board in anger.

WARNING STRONG LANGUAGE: Watch England's Joe Hart kicking during Italy defeat

The 27-year-old had hoped to start a decisive late move for the Three Lions as they chased an equaliser at the Arena da Amazonia after going behind to a Mario Balotelli header.

Hart can be heard shouting 'Hey, hey, hey. Give me the f****** ball', presumably to a ball boy behind the goal, before lashing out.

Roy Hodgson's No 1 came away from the incident unscathed, but he could have injured his right foot given the force of the kick.

Hart and his team-mates were left to rue Balotelli's goal, which sealed victory for the Azzurri after Daniel Sturridge had equalised Claudio Marchisio's long-range opener.

England face Uruguay in their second Group D game in Sao Paulo on Thursday, before their final match with Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte next Tuesday.
