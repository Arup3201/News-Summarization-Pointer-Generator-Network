Wonga, the payday loan company, has been required to write off £220million of debts for 330,000 customers. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has taken action because Wonga had been granting loans to customers without checking that they could afford the repayments.

Back in June, the same company admitted to sending fake letters from fictitious law firms to customers in arrears, attempting to frighten them into repaying debts. For this cruel deception they paid £2.6m in compensation.

Now these are not the actions of a commercially acceptable enterprise. Rather, they are the squalid manipulations of legalised loan sharks, whose profits are plundered from the distressed and the desperate. And this is the company whose name continues to disfigure the shirt of Newcastle United Football Club.

The point has been made repeatedly, not least in these pages, that the presence in football of these chancers, with their annual interest rates of up to 5,853 per cent, demeans not only the club, but the game itself.

Yet when the matter is raised with contacts at the club, the responses are recited like a familiar script: ‘They’re not doing anything illegal … their money’s as good as any- one’s ... £32m over four years is too much to turn down.’

The Newcastle owner, Mike Ashley, feels no need to explain this or any of his decisions; indeed, one imagines him staring at the bottom line and smiling at the fuss. Then there is his manager, Alan Pardew. When the Wonga deal was signed, precisely two years ago, Pardew greeted it with the Pollyanna enthusiasm of a born company man.

‘Now there’s no reason why we can’t be one of the top-four clubs,’ he boasted. ‘I listened to the owner (of Wonga) and their customer satisfaction levels are higher than any other bank or lending facility… When Wonga have been involved in football clubs they’ve been very successful. If our fans do have any concerns, maybe they should contact Blackpool supporters and see how they’ve done. The feeling I get is that Blackpool fans have been happy with Wonga and what they’ve done for the club.’

It was almost too easy to snigger at his crass misjudgment. Pardew cited Blackpool as evidence of the benefits that legalised loan sharks can bring to football. In this case, it appeared to involve a cheque of undisclosed proportions and a half–time competition which featured a giant Wonga logo hanging from the goal in front of the North Stand.

A lucky fan was invited to walk out on to ‘the hallowed Bloomfield Road turf’ and strike a football through the ‘O’ of Wonga. Success brought him a £150 prize. Unfortunately, most people missed this pantomime, since they preferred to go off for a cup of tea and complain about the first half. The last time I looked, one bookmaker was offering odds of 1-20 on for poor old Blackpool to be relegated to League One.

I was up there for a pre–season game, and I must tell the starry-eyed Pardew that the fans were deeply unhappy with just about every aspect of their car-crash of a football club. If anybody uttered a word in praise of Wonga, then I missed it.

For they understood exactly what attracts such a company to a sadly down-at-heel seaside town. And Newcastle fans, in the heart of the recession-plagued North East, are similarly aware of the cynical strategy. Where there is poverty and stark insecurity, there is Wonga.

Now it is clearly asking too much for men such as Ashley or Karl Oyston, the singularly charmless chairman of Blackpool, to recant, remove that objectionable shirt logo, renounce their ill-considered contracts, return the fees and face the consequences. Had they harboured the smallest scrap of sensitivity, then they would never have entered into such shameless agreements. But we are surely entitled to ask those who are charged with running the game to take a more civilised view.

It is not an unreasonable request. The FA chairman Greg Dyke, the Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore and the Football League chairman Greg Clarke should jointly announce that payday loan firms should no longer be allowed to advertise their services through the sponsorship of shirts.

They should point out that they are taking such action because of the damage to football’s image and the danger to football’s customers. And if they need moral and legal bases for their action, then they may find them in the closely-argued pages of the FCA report, which demonstrates their repugnant methods and their insatiable greed.

The case has been made. It is time that football took its stand against the sharks.

Racism is never a joke, Jose

By his own eccentric standards, Jose Mourinho’s season has been admirably restrained. Declining to court controversy or seek a cheap headline, he has obeyed the ancient cliché and let Chelsea’s football do the talking. But we sensed it was too good to last and, sure enough, he has broken cover with his assertion that ‘There is no racism in football’.

Mourinho had been asked about the wisdom of the English game adopting a version of American Football’s ‘Rooney Rule’, which decrees that at least one black or ethnic minority candidate must be interviewed for every managerial post. He insisted that: ‘Football is not so stupid to close doors to people. If you are good, you get the job. If you are top, you are top.’

Now it is perfectly possible for people of open minds and good intentions to differ about the desirability of the Rooney Rule. But the notion that football is immune from the virus of racism is flagrantly absurd. Racism exists in the police, the media and in both Houses of Parliament. It exists in the Institute of Directors, the Trade Union Congress and in every branch of the Armed Services. Mercifully, it is far less widespread and its manifestations far less odious than once they were. But excavate the dark corners of our society and the evidence will be exposed.

In any case, we cannot dismiss that deeply depressing statistic which tells us that while our 92 Premier and Football League clubs contain 25 per cent black players, only two have black managers. We can do much more to achieve decent, equitable, appropriate representation. An intelligent man like Mourinho is surely aware of this. We must therefore conclude that he is merely being mischievous.

He has chosen the wrong subject and the wrong moment for his little jape. Time to revert to restraint.

All hail Kimetto’s glorious triumph

In a weekend of a reckless Wayne Rooney and a breathless Ryder Cup, the deeds of Dennis Kimetto scarcely raised a flutter. Which was a great pity.

Because the 30-year-old Kenyan completed the Berlin Marathon in 2hrs, 2min and 57sec, thus becoming the first man to go beneath 2hrs 3min for the distance.

Imagine that: 26.2 miles at an average pace of around 4min 41.5sec per mile! It is beyond astonishing.

Kimetto took a full 26 seconds off the previous record. Thirty years ago this month, the Welshman Steve Jones set a fine world record of 2.08.05.

Kimetto would have left him almost a mile-and-a-half adrift.

It is, of course, impossible to quantify. But as a measure of athletic excellence, I would suggest that it stands alongside Roger Bannister’s first sub-4-minute mile or the various world records set by Usain Bolt. Kimetto was humility personified.

‘I went to Berlin just to compete, but I thank God that I have come back as a world record holder,’ he said. ‘It was a surprise.’

It was much more than that. It was a glorious triumph of human endeavour. We shall count ourselves fortunate to see anything comparable in this sporting year.

PS…

Joey Barton — the eminent linguist, professional provocateur and midfield scuffler — has been out of the public eye. And Joey hates to be ignored. So he decided to offer some unsolicited advice.

Barton knows why Arsenal haven’t won the title for ten years. It’s Arsene Wenger. The Arsenal manager doesn’t like ‘warriors’, it seems. He can’t stand ‘shouters and bawlers’.

And the result: ‘At the latter stages of a season they come unstuck because of that lack of — I hate to say it — a real lack of character or spine within the team.’

It was vintage Barton, more in sorrow than in anger. You just know that Wenger will be truly thankful.
