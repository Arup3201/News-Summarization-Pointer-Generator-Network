GPS blunder: Reinier Hernandez-Orta 30, is accused of stealing a trailer with $500,000 of imported wine

A man who made off with $500,000 worth of expensive wine was caught when the GPS system in the trailer showed police his every move.

Florida's Highway Patrol unit listened to live updates of the journey as Reinier Hernandez-Orta drove the truck along a toll road near Palm Beach.

Hernandez-Orta had no idea that police could see a real-time, detailed picture of his journey.

The Patrol unit who look after the 110-mile stretch of Florida's Turnpike started to follow the live location updates after the owner of American Express Lines reported a truck had disappeared on Tuesday afternoon.

When Hernandez-Orta stopped off at the Lake Worth service plaza, a trooper from the Highway Patrol   closed in on him.

However, when he arrived at the service stop, the trailer had been abandoned and the cab and driver were nowhere to be seen.

Moments later, a cab the same colour was spotted leaving the plaza, so the Highway Patrol pulled  30-year-old Hernandez-Orta over at the next exit. 

Hernandez-Orta was questioned immediately on the side of the road.

He insisted that he owned the truck and that he was its sole driver, according to the arrest report. 

Hernandez-Orta then requested a lawyer.

Spotted: The stolen trailer was recovered on the Florida Turnpike interchange

The original driver of the trailer came down to the service plaza to claim the trailer, telling the Highway Patrol about the imported wine inside.

Hernandez-Orta now faces a charge of first-degree felony grand theft.

On the same day he was booked into Palm Beach County Jail.

He is being held in custody in lieu of $100,000 bail.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
