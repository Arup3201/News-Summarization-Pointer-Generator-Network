After last week’s deadly shootings at the midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises, moviegoers across the nation have been on tenterhooks during their trips to the cinema.

Moviegoers in Pittsburgh witnessed not one, but two scenes of chaos in an AMC Loews theatre Sunday night, which prompted audience members to run for safety.

The footage, released by West Homestead police, first shows a middle-aged man getting into a brawl shoving another man to the ground; the second shows dozens of people fleeing from a theatre after two women got in a fight during a Dark Knight screening.

Brawling: Two scenes of chaos broke out at a Pittsburgh-area movie theatre this Sunday; in this one, a man got in a fight with a teenaged boy over waiting too long for the toilet

Violent: The video shows the man shoving the teen to the floor, and the teen's mother pouring her beverage over the man; the man then allegedly punched her in the face

The first, CNN reported, began when a male teenager was knocking on the door to the cinema’s toilets.

A man police identified as 51-year-old Anthony Labarbera emerges from the stall, apparently yelling at the teen.

The teenager’s mother didn’t appreciate the harsh words against her son and followed him.

What happens next, the video shows, is an all-out brawl, with the mother pouring her drink on the man. Police alleged that Labarbera then punched the mother on her face.

Second incident: Later on Sunday, two women got in a fight during a screening of The Dark Knight Rises, causing moviegoers to flee the theatre

Chaos: One witness said everyone was pushing one another in a desperate attempt to get out quickly

Scene: Both brawls happened at the AMC Loews in West Homestead, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh

Labarbera is facing simple assault charges for the alleged attack at AMC’s Loews Theater on the Waterfront, WPXI reported.

The next incident happened when two women began fighting inside a screening of The Dark Knight Rises later that afternoon.

According to WPXI, someone then yelled something which caused a mass-panic, and people began stampeding out of the theatre.

‘It was scary. People were screaming. Everyone was running, pushing each other,’ one witness told the station.

To compensate, the theatre gave everyone in that screening a free movie pass.
