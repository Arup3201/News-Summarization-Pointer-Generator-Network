Her sense of humour, loyalty and leadership are what friends of Katrina Dawson will remember most about her.

She was a wife, mother, sister and colleague, but to her childhood friends she was 'Tree' who was a prefect with a sweet tooth and had a 'wicked sense of humour'.

Sisters Harriet and Bee Alexander lived next door to Ms Dawson in Randwick - in Sydney's eastern suburbs - and remembered how she would enter their backyard via a rope ladder thrown over her fence.

Friends of Katrina Dawson - who died on Tuesday following the Martin Place siege - have paid tribute to their loved one

The Alexanders and a friend named Clare recalled how Ms Dawson's responsibility as a school leader did not stop her from indulging in lollies with fellow students after school, despite the fact eating in the Ascham School uniform was forbidden, Harriet wrote in The Sydney Morning Herald. 

'So it was with sad stomachs that we stepped off the bus on the day that Tree was inevitably made a prefect,' she said.

'Surely now she must observe the school rules. But incredibly, she led us straight back into the corner store. Her commitment to friends and lollies trumped her commitment to the badge.'

Her friends also spoke of her 'generosity and loyalty' which was described as 'legendary'.

Ms Dawson - who reportedly tried to protect her friend from gunshots during the siege - has been remembered as a 'very funny, loving person, very popular, very caring person'

She was one of 17 hostages who were held for almost 17 hours across Monday and Tuesday

This commitment to her loved ones was with her even in the face of death when the barrister and 16 other hostages were detained at Lindt Cafe at Sydney's Martin Place for 17 hours by self-styled sheik Man Haron Monis.

In her last act of friendship, there have been reports Ms Dawson tried to protect her colleague Julie Taylor who was pregnant at the time from the rain of gunshots when police finally decided to raid the cafe in the early hours of Tuesday morning.

Ms Dawson, 38, was one of two people who died in the siege along with Lindt Cafe manager Tori Johnson, 34. 

Friend Clare said Ms Dawson 'would have been the one looking after everyone'.

But friends say if she liked coffee she might not have been down to the cafe to get her morning pick me up at 9.15am. 

Bee said it was Ms Dawson's 'only flaw' and Harriet added the mother-of-three would have 'appreciated the irony, even on the day of her death'.

Lindt Cafe manager Tori Johnson was one of three people killed when police ended the siege

The trio of friends also revealed Ms Dawson tragically died on the same day as her mother's birthday.

Senior Counsel Jeremy Stoljar worked closely with Katrina at Eight Selborne chambers and was not only a mentor but a close friend as well. 

He described her as a 'terrific barrister' with 'first class legal skills'.

'She was a very funny, loving person, very popular, very caring person. I can't believe we're having this conversation,' Mr Stoljar told Fairfax Media.

Her ability to juggle her family life and her successful career sparked many aspiring female barristers to seek her guidance on how to do the same.

Despite graduating from Edgecliffe's Ascham - in Sydney's east - 10 years ago, Ms Dawson's legal skills were put to good use mentoring young students at her alma mater.

She remained a dedicated member of the school community, with her eldest daughter Chloe - who had just finished Year 2 this year - and her younger daughter Sasha set to start at the all-girls institution next year.

Their deaths have sparked an outpouring of grief from across Australia and the world. Martin Place has become a shrine of flowers dedicated to the pair

Friend Clare said Ms Dawson - who leaves behind her husband, Paul, and her three children - 'would have been the one looking after everyone'.

Ms Dawson's demonstrated leadership earned her respect wherever she went as well as her benevolent nature.

'She was generous in giving of her time and this year Katrina used her skills as a barrister to guide our senior students in preparing for mock trials,' Ascham's Head of School Andrew Powell, who 'knew her well', said in a statement.

On social media, school friends posted about their sadness at Ms Dawson's death and their admiration of the 'gorgeous, bright woman'.

'So incredibly sad. My heart is breaking for her children & her family, and send my dearest love to them. Katrina, your poise & clever wit is something I will always remember,' one friend wrote.

Another person said: 'So very sad. Such a beautiful woman with astounding intelligence. Thinking of her family, friends and colleagues at this time.' 

'Rest in peace to such a gorgeous, bright woman. I will always remember her sitting on stage at assembly in committee [student council]. Such a heavy heart for her family, my thoughts are with them,' a former Ascham student posted.

Ms Dawson died on Tuesday morning after she was taken to hospital from the scene. 

A policewoman told Daily Mail Australia she was unable to confirm the circumstances of how the mother-of-three died as it was up to the coroner to rule on her death.
