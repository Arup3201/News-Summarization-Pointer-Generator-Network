Police were called to the robbery at the jewellers just after 12.30pm yesterday and a helicopter was also sent out. 

Megan Swan, 20, filmed the incident on her phone as she sat on her bed reading a book. 

Miss Swan, a sociology and politics student at Bristol University, said: 'It was a bit of shock really.

'I was just sat on my bed, with my window next to me, reading my book when I heard three or four loud bangs.

'I thought it was a bit annoying really, but when I heard someone shout "run" I looked to see what was happening.

'I had to do a double take and I thought "is this really happening?".

'I couldn't believe my eyes really. It's not something that happens in a nice neighbourhood.

'It all happened so, so quickly, I wish I had got my phone out quicker to get more of it but it took me so long to register what was happening.'

The Clifton Village jewellers was left smashed up following the raid yesterday

Police closed off the area outside the building on The Mall for several hours after the front window was smashed in

Miss Swan immediately ran outside to comfort the shocked shop owner, and waited for police to hand the footage in.

Officers were able to note down the number plate and get a description of the four men.

Bernard Smith, a kitchen designer at Kit Stone, opposite the jewellers, also witnessed the robbery.  

He said: 'I was working at my desk when I heard this thumping sound. I thought it was a lorry unloading or something dumping boxes down.

'When I looked up I saw three men, maybe four, wearing hoodies or masks and carrying big American-style baseball bats.

'When I heard their car engine going, I ran to the door to get the registration number, and then I rang the police.

'It was a large silver four by four. It was all over in about a minute.

'The banging was so loud even from over the road, it was scary. The noise of bats hitting the glass must have been terrifying for the girls inside the jewellers.'

This is not the first time the jewellers have been targeted. A failed armed raid occurred last June.
