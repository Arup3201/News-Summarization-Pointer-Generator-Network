A man who used a 'flesh stapler' to treat his injured fighting dogs has escaped jail.

Tony Barbara, 48, has been banned from keeping the animals for 10 years after an RSPCA investigation into dog fighting.

Romford Magistrates' Court heard that Barbara had trained two pit bull terriers - called Elaine and Susie - and a bull terrier called Gerald for fighting.

Police and RSPCA inspectors found the 
stapler - a DIY method of treating wounds - and a 'flirt pole', a long stick with bait attached to improve dogs' chasing, jumping and biting, at his home in Dagenham, Essex.

Forensic tests showed the stapler had canine DNA on it.

The court also heard there was clear evidence that Barbara, described as 'troubled' by police, had used the dogs for fighting - including notebooks recording detailed accounts of their fights.

Barbara was convicted of a string of animal cruelty offences last year.

He was handed a 24-week suspended prison sentence and banned from keeping dogs for ten years at Romford Magistrates' Court.

He was convicted of possession of the flirt pole and a veterinary kit including the flesh stapler.

Barbara, who is unemployed, had previously admitted possession of the two pit bull terrier type dogs, Susie and Elaine, in breach of the Dangerous Dogs Act.

He was also found guilty of failing to get appropriate treatment for his pitbull Elaine, who had an injury to her teat and conjunctivitis.

Despite the finding of the notebooks, Barbara was acquitted of five charges of causing animal fights to take place between 29 May and 6 September in 2011.

The district judge said although there was clear evidence the fights took place, there was no way of proving whether they happened within the jurisdiction of England and Wales.

Barbara was also found not guilty of four charges of causing unnecessary suffering, while two welfare offence charges were formally dismissed halfway through his trial, which took place last year.

The fighting dogs were kept in the garden of unemployed Barbara's home, where RSCPA inspectors carried out a search as part of the special operations unit's investigation in the practice

He was also ordered to pay costs of £780 at yesterday's sentencing. 

Speaking after the sentencing, Mike Butcher, of the RSPCA's special operations unit, said: 'Tony Barbara trained his dogs for the sole purpose of fighting - an activity which was a premeditated act intended ultimately to cause horrific levels of deliberate cruelty in the pit.

'He is clearly a troubled man, but it appears the one constant in his life was dog fighting.

'Despite this, there is no excuse for inflicting such suffering on those dogs we know about, and potentially many more that we don't.

'Dog fighting is a depressing blot on our reputation as a nation of animal lovers.

'While people like Barbara continue to pursue their sickening obsession, we will continue to track them down and bring them before the courts.'
