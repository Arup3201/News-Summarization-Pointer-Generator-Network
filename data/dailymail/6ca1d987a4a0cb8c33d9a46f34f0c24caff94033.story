A man stabbed his new business partner six times as they drove to the bank because he feared the manager would reveal debts he had hidden from him.

Car dealer Gary Brown had to be brought back to life by doctors after his financial advisor Barry Bell plunged a knife into his neck and chest in a horrific car park attack.

The pair had been travelling in one car and on their way to a pre-arranged meeting with their bank manager, a judge heard today. 

But Bell owed his 53-year-old victim £40,000 pounds and he was worried the bank 
would reveal he was also heavily in debt to other people after a £15,000
pound repayment cheque bounced, the court heard.

The business partners had been 
travelling to a meeting with their bank manager in Bedford, 
Bedfordshire, when Bell pulled over, and began a brutal assault which 
left the father-of-three fighting for survival.

After Bell was sentenced to 12 years for the brutal attack on his business partner at Luton Crown Court today, Mr Brown attacked the 'appalling' justice system after the attacker was told he could walk out of prison in just six years.

Speaking outside court, the motor trader, of Buntingford, Hertfordshire, said: 'Twelve years is not 12 years - he'll be out in six years able to start his life again, but I'll be worse off.

'This has been hanging over me and my family for months and put a lot of stress and strain on us. I'm not able to work and I've lost all my money.

'The fact a man has come so close to killing me will be walking the streets in six years' time is disturbing. It's appalling.'

The attack on May 17 last year was only stopped when a brave member of the public 'saved Mr Brown's life" by opening the car door and shouting for help.

Mr Brown said: 'What sort of person can be friendly and talking to you one minute and climbing all over you with a knife the next minute?

'He's a danger to society and I am fearful about the future. I keep telling myself I'm lucky to be alive but what life will I have now?

'I've got a child at university and two more in school and I can't work. How am I going to provide for them?'

Bell, of Lindisfarne Priory, Bedford, was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to endanger life after a jury acquitted him of the more serious charge of attempted murder.

The financial advisor, who had no previous convictions, stood expressionless in the dock wearing a black suit, blue shirt and burgundy tie as Judge Richard Foster jailed him for 12 years.

'You will serve up to half of what I'm about to pass,' the judge said.

'It's quite clear from the evidence that you pre-planned and premeditated this attack.

'You took that knife from the garage where you had been that morning; you were trying to find a quiet place in a car park in order to carry out this attack.

'This was a sustained and repeated assault on the victim.

'You are very fortunate that he did not die. Had he died, you would be facing sentencing for murder today.'

Praising the Good Samaritan who stopped the attack, Judge Foster said: 'So many people these days, given what must have been a horrific sight, would have passed by and not got involved. He did get involved.

'By that intervention, he might have saved someone's life.'
