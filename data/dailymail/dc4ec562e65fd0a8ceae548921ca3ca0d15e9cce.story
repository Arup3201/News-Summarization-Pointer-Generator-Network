England centre Kyle Eastmond has been cleared to play in Saturday's QBE International against South Africa at Twickenham after recovering from illness.

Eastmond had been troubled by diarrhoea since the 24-21 defeat by New Zealand but took a full part in Tuesday morning's training session, as did wing Semesa Rokoduguni who has recovered from a hip problem.

'Kyle was a bit ill but he's fully fit now. Rokoduguni trained as well and seems to be all right,' attacking skills coach Mike Catt said.

Head coach Stuart Lancaster was ready to move Owen Farrell to inside centre and select George Ford at fly-half if Eastmond failed to recover in time for the second of England's four autumn internationals.

Catt believes Farrell and Ford would work well in tandem, but insists Eastmond performed well against New Zealand and will be given another chance on Saturday.

'At the moment Kyle is doing all right alongside Owen,' Catt said.

'Kyle got some good hits in against New Zealand. He looked confident and we expect a big performance this weekend too.

'Picking Owen and George would mean two ball-playing fly-halves in the team.

'From my experiences of playing with Jonny Wilkinson, it works if you want to play a particular game.

'They are both still very young and the beauty about those two is that it's all about the team. It is not about them as individuals.

'They have one hell of a relationship, but we will obviously address it when it needs to be addressed.

'If picking them is what's best for the team, then I am sure Stuart will do it.'

Catt is full of admiration for 20-year-old South Africa fly-half Handre Pollard and while he believes the Springboks have added more strings to their bow, he insists their power game remains their main threat.

The tourists lost 29-15 to Ireland in Dublin on Saturday and Catt said: 'They are playing a lot more expansively. Their centres are very physical as usual, but they also come from depth.

'Pollard has come through from the under-20s and has been exceptional. He has burst on to the international scene and has a very good kicking game.

'Ireland seemed to close them down a little bit on certain occasions on Saturday, but you have got to stop the big green machine rolling.

'And that is when it comes down to defence because with their setback at the weekend...... well we know what's coming.'
