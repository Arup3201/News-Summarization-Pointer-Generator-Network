Posting this photo on Facebook, Fatima said the man had attacked her as she went on a Sunday run through her local park in Guadalajara

A woman who snapped photo of a sex attacker who chased her as she took a Sunday run has put the picture on Facebook. 

Fatima Guzman, 32, hopes that by posting the picture on social media she will be able to to  track the man down and give his name to the police.

The mother was jogging through her local park in her home town of Guadalajara in the state of Jalisco, in central Mexico, when she spotted the man hiding in a bush and watching her.

But as she ran past he gave chase. Luckily the man was wrestled to the ground by passersby who heard Fatima's screams.

Fatima said: 'I was screaming like a maniac as he tried touching me and thank God there were people nearby.

'One man grabbed him and I took a photo of him with my phone and demanded to know his name so I could report him.

'But he refused to tell me and then he managed to break free and run off.'

Refusing to let the issue go and concerned for the safety of other women, Fatima took to social media to try to track the man down.

Posting his photo on Facebook, she asked anyone who recognized the man to get in contact with her so she could report him to the police. She wrote: 'I got a fright on Sunday while running in the park near my house.

'Unfortunately, I need his name to report him to police and I do not have it. 

 'It is outrageous that some 'men' think they have a right to the body of any woman and it is very difficult for me to share this on social networks.

'But if there are no legal things I can do about this at least if his wife or his kids see this message he will feel embarrassed.

'You can send me a message if you have any data to identify and locate him.'

Fatima, 32, said that as she ran past the man he gave chase until he was wrestled to the ground by passersby who heard her screams. She demanded to know his name but he managed to break free and run off
