Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero is expected to escape any disciplinary action for a studs-up lunge on West Ham's Mark Noble.

Aguero's challenge saw his boot go over the ball and connect with the Hammers midfielder but it is understood referee Martin Atkinson saw the incident at the time and decided to take no action.

That would prevent the Football Association taking retrospective action against City's Argentina striker and ensures he will not be banned for the Manchester derby.

West Ham manager Sam Allardyce had complained about the challenge, saying: 'It was a dangerous tackle and the referee was right in front of it.'

Meanwhile, West Brom defender Craig Dawson is also set to escape any action over an elbow on Crystal Palace goalkeeper Julian Speroni.

Palace boss Neil Warnock called the incident an 'assault' but referee Mark Clattenburg is understood to have seen the challenge and allowed the Baggies first goal to stand in Saturday's 2-2 draw.

Speroni had to be replaced by Wayne Hennessey after the collision, described by Neil Warnock as an 'assault'

Speroni required lengthy treatment before being substituted by Warnock,who said he wanted to protect the keeper from suffering any potential damage.

Warnock said: 'If officials can't see a smash like that then I've got to protect my goalkeeper.

'It's almost an assault. He comes from two or three yards away and smashes him in the face. I don't understand why at least one of the officials can't see that.'
