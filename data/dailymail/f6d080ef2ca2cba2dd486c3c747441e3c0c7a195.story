An anti-violence activist who stood up to superstar rappers Tyler the Creator and Snoop Lion (aka Snoop Dogg) has revealed that she was terrified to leave her house and lived in fear of attack after receiving thousands of messages of vile abuse from fans of the rappers.

Talitha Stone, 25, has told MailOnline about the heavy toll her work has taken on her saying she wanted to 'hide away and never do anything like this again' after her attempts to have the rappers banned from entering Australia led to threats of rape and death from rap fans.

The abuse, which mainly took place on Twitter, included 'death threats and saying things like  they're going to grab me in the alleyway, that I need a good f***, that they're going to go for my family first. One said that they would hire someone to cut my t**s off,' she said.

A high school student in Melbourne even posted what he thought was Talitha's address online. The address was wrong, but it was only a street away from where Talitha was sharing a house with another girl.

'Who knows what could have happened. It was not a fun time, I didn't sleep much and jumped at noises. Every time I was alone I was panicked, I was so afraid, but at the same time I was so angry that this was my reality,' she said.

The abuse started after Talitha created a petition to have Tyler the Creator denied a visa to enter Australia last year, on the grounds that his lyrics incited violence against women.

His songs include lines like: 'You call this s*** rape but I think that rape’s fun, I just got one request, stop breathing' and 'I wanna tie her body up and throw her in my basement, Keep her there, so nobody can wonder where her face went.'

Talitha came to the attention of Tyler the Creator when she tweeted that he would be at a signing event in Sydney and suggested that the event organisers needed a lesson in what misogyny was.

Tyler the Creator retweeted her comment to his 1.7 million fans and suddenly her phone went crazy.

'It was instant, oh my gosh, the barrage of threats, I couldn't believe it. I was just sitting there looking at my phone, I was like: "Holy crap, what is happening? What have I done?"'

When Talitha went to the police about the thousands of messages she had received, she said they laughed at her.

'They were like: "Do you think we're going to do anything about this? Do you know how often people come in here about threats of abuse and death on Twitter?" They just laughed at me like I was so stupid, they gave me a cyber safe brochure and sent me out.'

The 25-year-old began working as an anti-violence campaigner in 2012 after she heard about the work of Collective Shout, a grassroots organisation run by Melinda Tankard-Reist

Tyler the Creator singled Talitha out at his show, not realising that she was in the audience filming his performance

The tweet that started it all: Tyler the Creator retweeted this comment from Talitha, leading to thousands of his followers posting abusive messages to Talitha

Talitha received thousands of abusive and threatening tweets from fans of Tyler the Creator. This was one of the least offensive, many of them contained threats of serious violence against the activist

Talitha ended up going to Tyler the Creator's Sydney show to film evidence of misogyny and she stood in horror as the rapper mentioned her during his set, dedicating his song, B**** Suck D***, to her.

Video of the concert shows Tyler the Creator, who seemed unaware that Talitha was in the audience, call out to the 'f***ing w****' who tried to get him kicked out of the country.

'F***ing b****, I wish she could hear me call her a b****, too, f***ing w****. Yeah, I got a sold-out show right now b****. Hey this f***ing song is dedicated to you, you f***ing c***.'

He also said he hoped Talitha's children 'get some messed up STDs'.

Talitha said she was petrified that someone in the crowd would recognise her. 'I honestly didn't believe what I was hearing when he called me out. I was terrified.'

She reported him to the police, but they said there was nothing they could do.

The abuse continued for months after the concert and led to Talitha meeting with two executives from Twitter, which led to the introduction of the 'Report Abuse' button on the site.

'I was like: this is ridiculous, where's the protection for women? I got told to delete my account, that was my option. They were like, "Why are you fuelling this?" Me fuelling this? Are you kidding me? I'm speaking out against rape and I'm getting rape threats in return, yeah that makes sense,' she said.

'So much in me wanted to hide away and never do anything like this again, but at the same time it also fuelled me to keep doing this, I was like: There's no way they're going to silence me. It made me more determined,' she said.

In January, Talitha launched a petition to have Snoop Lion (aka Snoop Dogg) banned from the country and received social media abuse, which lasted for months

Ready to take on the world: Talitha has returned to her work as an anti-violence campaigner and in July will start a new role with Collective Shout, speaking at schools about sexual violence

This determination gave her the energy to try to get Snoop Lion (aka Snoop Dogg)'s visa revoked when he came to Australia in January.

Her main objection to Snoop Lion was that he had admitted to pimping out girls in a Rolling Stone article in 2013, saying he had a bus follow him on his 2003 tour with ten women on it.

'I could fire a b****, f*** a b****, get a new ho: It was my program. City to city, titty to titty, hotel room to hotel room, athlete to athlete, entertainer to entertainer,' he said.

Again Talitha petitioned (unsuccessfully) to have Snoop Lion denied access to the country, again she was hit with an onslaught of abuse from the rapper's fans.

She said that this time she received less abuse and Snoop Lion did not engage with her directly, but the impact of the abuse was a lot worse.

'I didn't have anything left in me, I couldn't do it. I was completely drained. It's just so exhausting and you just feel like, what's the point sometimes, when is there ever going to be change?'

The Snoop Lion campaign was the third campaign the young activist has headed up, the first involved her trying out for the Lingerie Football League in 2012.

Talitha said she wanted to see what the experience was like and whether the League's insistence that the women would be treated as athletes was true. She found that it wasn't.

She said that walking into try-outs 'was like walking up to a nightclub. We got told we had to have a dress code at the try outs – sports bra and short shorts. I had to take my top off so I had my sports bra on.

'If we lost they would scream at us and call us a pussy and make a 'pussy symbol' above our heads. It was a huge joke.'

The reaction to Talitha's exposé was her first experience of serious online abuse, with people taking to Twitter to threaten and attack her.

'They were trying to scare me, with rape or death,' she said.

The first campaign Talitha participated in was in protest of the Lingerie Football League. She tried out for the team and then wrote about the experience

Talitha is speaking out as she is about to return to work with women's advocacy group Collective Shout after a six-month hiatus.

The Sydney woman became involved in advocacy work for women and girls after 'frequent unwanted sexual experiences' as a child and teenager.

'It's so sickening, I hate that this is a reality for women and it's becoming more and more common,' she said.

She began researching different organisations and read news articles before she stumbled on Collective Shout, a grassroots Australian advocacy group headed up by Melinda Tankard-Reist.

After the draining experience of her campaigns against the two rappers, Talitha took some time out – travelling to Europe, working a series of odd jobs and spending time with family and friends.

It is only in the last few weeks, almost six months after Snoop Lion was in the country, that she has felt able to pick up her advocacy work again.

'I took a lot of time out. I had to put in boundaries. I've only just in the last month slowly, slowly got back into it,' she said.

The next step for the young activist is a new role at Collective Shout speaking at schools around the country about issues to do with violence, pornography, eating disorders and the sexualisation of children.

She has been visiting schools for years alongside Melinda Tankard-Reist and can't get over the fact that many of the students recognise her.

'The young people at schools I'm going to, they've heard of me. I have young kids come up to me and say: "It is an honour, can I please shake your hand? You're my hero." It makes no sense to me. It is just overwhelming.

'I'm doing this because I have to. I need to do this for them.'
