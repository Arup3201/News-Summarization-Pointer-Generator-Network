A taxi driver travelled all the way to Amsterdam after accidentally breaking a souvenir that one of his passengers brought back from their holiday. 

Cabbie Kevin Gregg, 52, travelled 450 miles from Newcastle to the Dutch capital in pursuit of the irreparable windmill ornament for customer Hazel Lindley. 

He was under strict instructions from East Coast Taxis' managing director Paul Irwin who, after hearing what had happened, delivered an outstanding display of customer service.

Taxi driver Kevin Gregg travelled to Amsterdam and back to buy a replacement windmill souvenir for Hazel Lindley after he accidentally broke the item

Kevin Gregg was amazed he managed to find the souvenir shop so quickly in Amsterdam

'I heard the crack as I put something down on top of her bag and I immediately felt sick as I didn't know what it was', Kevin said. 

'Hazel said she would just glue it but it stayed on my mind for the next few days. 

'I was shocked at first as no taxi company ever does this but I was over the moon when Paul told me I could go and find a replacement, it was unbelievable. 

'It was a bit scary at first as I kept thinking what if I can't find it or what if the market is closed. 

'Luckily, I found it quite quickly, I got off the bus and bought a map and although it was on an awkward street, I asked a passer by who spoke English and found it.

 'I couldn't believe it was that easy, especially as the picture Paul had given me was in black and white! 'Once I had it, I guarded it more than I would guard my own kids!' 

Pensioner Hazel, who lives at Felton, near Morpeth, Northumberland, said: 'They really made my day. 

'I couldn't believe the level of customer service they have shown. I'm sure other firms would simply have apologised and left it at that.' 

EastCoast Taxis decided to go above and beyond to replace a passenger's souvenir one of their drivers had accidently damaged

She was returning from a short break in Amsterdam when her taxi driver packed the car and inadvertently placed a heavy item onto a bag containing a wooden souvenir windmill. The windmill was damaged beyond repair leaving Hazel upset and the taxi driver embarrassed and apologetic. 

When Tyneside based EastCoast Taxis' managing director Paul Irwin heard about the accidental damage caused he decided to put things right. 

He said: 'With more than 200 taxis on the road carrying 70,000 passengers every week, we do expect the odd mishap but at EastCoast we like to look after our customers. 

'We know that the souvenir windmill wasn't expensive but the fact is that Hazel couldn't get a replacement anywhere other than Amsterdam and that was the challenge.' 

Mr Gregg left his home of Whitley Bay to travel to Amsterdam in Holland for a special journey

Kevin, of North Parade, Whitley Bay, was 'over the moon' that he was able to successfully replace the ornament. 

'When I saw Hazel, we just cuddled, she reminded me of my nana, she kept apologising for the hassle she thought she had caused.

'I'm just delighted that I was able to get her a replacement, but I don't want anything to break in my taxi again. 

'Unless I have to go to America! Just kidding,' he added.
