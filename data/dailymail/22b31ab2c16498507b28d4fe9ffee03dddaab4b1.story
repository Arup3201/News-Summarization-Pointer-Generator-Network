A woman has taken her former lover to court and is demanding the return of $65,000 which she claims she lent him so he could divorce his then wife and also pay for a third woman - pregnant with his unborn child - to have an abortion.

According to her Manhattan Supreme Court lawsuit, Amy Marie Cooper dated Martin Priest, 36, for four years. She claims she didn't know that he was still living with his wife Tianna, 32, at the time.

The relationship between Cooper and Wall Street trader Priest ended in 2012, when she found out his wife was pregnant, although she admits that she still had 'feelings for him.'

According to court papers, Cooper claims that Priest got back in touch the next year and told her that his marriage had 'irretrievably broken down and that he was a victim of abuse from his wife.'

Cooper also claims in her lawsuit that 'another woman, Carrie Wharton, was pregnant with his child... and likewise abused him.'

Priest, a financial advisor at Daiwa Capital Markets, allegedly told Cooper he 'was in dire need of money in order to protect himself and his children from his wife and pay Carrie to abort her unborn child.'

When Priest told Cooper that he wanted to rekindle their romance, she agreed to help him out of his fix and lent him $65,000, according to court papers.

Priest, right, 'had no intentions' of ever getting back with Cooper and instead he wanted to get a quickie divorce so that he could run off with pregnant girlfriend Wharton, left

But Priest 'had no intentions' of ever getting back with Cooper, and instead wanted to get a quickie divorce so that he could run off with pregnant girlfriend Wharton.

Priest has denied the allegations, which he called 'completely salacious . . . absolutely false,' reports the New York Post.

Priest and Wharton, who now live in Montville, New Jersey, they have an infant son and married in October, according to Wharton's Facebook page.Â
