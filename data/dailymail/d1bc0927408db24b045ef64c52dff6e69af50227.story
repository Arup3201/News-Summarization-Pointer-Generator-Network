The perfect belly button is oval-shaped and vertically-oriented, according to the results of new research from a group of plastic surgeons.

Surgeons at the University of Singapore's Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, whose research was published in ASJ, analyzed images of 37 Playboy Playmates (really) to assess the ideal length, shape and position of the navel.

With the help of a computerized tool called an 'Aesthetic Analyzer', they established that a perfect belly button has a ratio of 46:54, and a midline horizontal position.

The ideal length is 5per cent of the 
length from the lower breastbone to the lower part of the vulvar cleft, 
and the 'hood,' or flap, is very small.

Study author Shu Jin Lee and 
his colleagues had previously developed the software to analyze images 
of the nose, breast and umbilicus.

However, plastic surgeon Dr. Adam Rubinstein of Miami, Florida, tells Today.com that most people just want their belly button to be in the 'range of normal.'

'Using Playboy Playmates is kind of an arbitrary sample. Just because these women are considered beautiful doesn’t mean they have beautiful belly buttons,' he said.

Belly button surgery, called umbilicoplasty, takes approximately 45 minutes.

In 2011, Dr. Curtis Cetrulo Jr, a surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, told NBC News that most patients ask for 'a vertical dime slot of a belly button that's small and thin.'

The procedure is sometimes performed as part of a tummy tuck, which may affect the belly button's shape.

Previous research to develop a navel aesthetic took place in 2000 at the University of Missouri, where images of 147 female belly buttons were shown to a panel of 15 men and 6 women.

According to Charles L. Puckett's journal article In Search of the Ideal Female Umbilicus, navels considered beautiful were small and vertically oriented, or T-shaped, while horizontal belly buttons were thought to be ugly.
