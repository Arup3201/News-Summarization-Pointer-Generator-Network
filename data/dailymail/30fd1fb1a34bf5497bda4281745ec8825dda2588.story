A bust to commemorate the wife of a former Romanian president in her hometown of Targu-Jiu is at the centre of a row after the Ministry of Culture demanded it be reworked because the breasts are too large.

Gorj County Council paid 5,000 euros (£4,110) for the work but then asked local artist Paul Popescu to rework it to make her breasts smaller after the Ministry had complained.

The sculpture showed Arethia Tatarescu who was born in the city of Targu-Jiu in 1889 and after a short while studying art in Belgium, moved back to Romania where she met and married the man who was to become prime minister, Gheorghe Tatarescu.

She was famous for introducing the idea of mass weddings into Europe and in the 1930s organised huge wedding ceremonies when up to 1,500 couples got married at the same time.

However, after the statue was unveiled in a local park it failed to find favour with Radu Boroianu, a deputy minister in the Romanian Ministry of Culture and himself a keen collector of modern art, who called for it to be taken down.

Pompiliu Ciolacu, head of the council's Culture Department, said: 'Artistically it's exaggerated, and that means that aesthetically it doesn't resemble the real image of the person.'

They have ordered that the sculpture be taken down and reworked to reduce the size of the breasts.

That idea was rejected by artist Popescu who is refusing to make the breasts smaller.

Support: Arethia Tatarescu was born in the city of Targu-Jiu in 1889 and went on to marry Gheorghe Tatarescu

He said: 'It's a totally arbitrary reason and at the end of the day in artwork breast size is a matter of taste. 

'We don't all have to like the same type of women, the same way that not every woman likes the same type of man.

'Minister Boroianu personally finds it too sexy because the breasts are too large. I don't think that the breasts are too small, and I don't think that they are too large. I think they are just right.'

Popescu is currently working on building the highest statue in Europe of the Egyptian goddess Isis. 

He is working on it for Nicolae Sofianu, the richest man in Targu-Jiu, and said so far the issue of breast size not been a problem on his new project.
