Google has revealed a new music and gaming service in a bid to increase its lead on Apple in the mobile phone market - and redesigned its social network to take on Facebook.

The search giant unveiled a host of 
new products including a dramatic overhaul of its maps service during a 3.5 hour keynote at its 
annual software developers' conference in San Francisco today.

They include All Access, a subscription music service, and Google Play, a gaming system.

Larry Page, Google's co-founder and chief executive, told the firms I/O conference  'We are really only at 1 per cent of what is possible' as a host of new features were unveiled

Google's announcements included:

All Access will be competing with Spotify, Rhapsody, Pandora and other popular music services.

Apple, the biggest seller of online music, does not have a subscription-based service - although it is rumoured to be developing one.

Google wants to not only offer access to millions of songs, but also help guide you to music you might like.

You can choose one of 22 music genres and see key albums that define the genre along with recommendations from Google's curators.

Users can listen to any track right away, or switch to a 'radio station' format featuring songs you'll likely want to hear.

The cost is $9.99 a month in the U.S., after a 30-day free trial, and it will launch today- although plans for international version have not been announced.

Commenting on the launch of Google's subscription music streaming service, Google Play Music All Access, BPI Chief Executive Geoff Taylor said: 'Streaming is the fastest growing part of the £330m digital music sector in Britain, with over than a million paying subscribers already and millions more enjoying free and ad-supported music.

'The entry of a player with the reach of Google will persuade many more consumers to experience having millions of songs to play instantly on their phone, tablet or PC.'

The audience of about 6,000 people at 'Google I/O' includes engineers and entrepreneurs who develop applications and other features that can make smartphones and tablets more appealing.

Android already has been activated on 900 million devices made by Samsung Electronics Co., HTC Corp. and other manufacturers, the firm said - and over 48 billion apps have been downloaded.

The firm also revealed its plans to make technology 'disappear'.

'Technology should do the hard work so people can get on with what makes them happy in life,' said Google's Larry Page.

'We are really only at 1 per cent of what is possible.'

He also talked about the search giant's plans for Google Glass, its controversial wearable computer.

'Glass is a new category, it's quite different but I think our main goal is to get happy users - so we want to make sure we are building experience to make happy.

'Then we can get going and work on it for the next ten year.s

We don't know what people will do with it.

'I love taking pictures of my kids, and that's enough reason to have glass on its own.'

Google
 is adding leaderboards and the ability to match players in online games
 to its Android operating system for smartphones and tablet computers.

The new features match those 
available in Apple's Game Center for the iPhone and iPad. Google is also
 making it possible to save game progress online, so players can pick up
 games where they left off, even on other devices.

Google announced the new game services at its annual software developers' conference in San Francisco.

Three
 employees tried to demonstrate on stage how they could all join a 
racing game, but failed to pull off the demo due to wireless 
connectivity issues in the conference center.

The
 Google Play leaderboards will also be available through a browser, said
 Hugo Barra, vice president of product management of Android.

Google also revealed a new version of Samsung's Galaxy S4 handset.

It will run on a newer version of the Android operating system, version 4.2. The Android version will still be called Jelly Bean, rather than Key Lime Pie - the next in a series of dessert-themed code names.

It will be unlocked, meaning it will work with any carrier, including those abroad. But it also means the price won't be subsidized by the carrier.

Google will sell it for $649 starting June 26, rather than the usual $200 or so with a two-year contract.

Google says the new phone is a variant of Samsung's Galaxy S4 phone, which was recently released.

Google also says that the new phone will be able to get Android updates as we come.

The firm also revealed a major redesign of its Google+ social network.

Google is introducing 41 new features to its Google Plus social network, which Google is positioning as an alternative to Facebook.

Google Plus had more than 135 million
 active users at the end of last year, based on Google's last public 
disclosure about activity on that network. 

That left Google Plus far behind Facebook, which boasts 1.1 billion active users.

Among them is a newly designed stream of content - one designed to be dynamic, rather than a long list seen in Facebook.

It also revealed improved photo editing for pictures uploaded to the site, including an 'auto awesome' feature.

'We've shown you a new, modern multicolumn stream,' the firm said.

'We think we just put the Google into Google+'
