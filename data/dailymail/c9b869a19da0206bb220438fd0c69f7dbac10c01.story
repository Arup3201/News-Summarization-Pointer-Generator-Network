Specialist rescue workers are searching for survivors beneath the rubble of a house that collapsed in ruins today after a devastating blaze.

It is thought there was an explosion after fire broke out inside the end terrace house in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, shortly after 5am today, and two men, aged 38 and 60, and a 78-year-old woman received medical treatment.

The structural damage to the building was so severe it was deemed unsafe to send fire crews inside, and the specialist Urban Search and Rescue team was deployed to sift through the debris amid fears a third man known to have lived at the property could have been inside when fire broke out.

Collapse: The blaze destroyed four terraced houses as it ripped through the buildings in Rochdale, Greater Manchester - rescue workers said one man remains unaccounted for

Rescue operation: The interior of the end terrace house was exposed to the elements as a result of the blaze, which prompted the first floor and the roof of the property to collapse

The team, accompanied by a sniffer dog, were combing the smouldering interior of the property, much of which was visible from the street today after the roof and external walls collapsed.

Police officers and fire crews at the scene of the blaze, which also caused severe damage to neighbouring properties on the terraced street, said one person remained unaccounted for.

They are searching for another man who was known to live at the property, although he is not thought to have been resident in the house for around two weeks.

The cause of the fire, which broke out in the end terrace house, is yet to be established.

The roof and first floor of the property collapsed as fire tore through the building, exposing the charred interior of the house as firefighters scrambled through the rubble today.

The devastating fire also caused severe damage to the roof of the next door property, along with more minor damage to the next two properties along.

War Office Road was closed to traffic today and police set up diversions as crews worked to bring the blaze under control.

Fire service area manager Wayne 
Shields said: 'Something has happened in an end terraced property - a 
row of four houses - that’s caused the gable end of the house to 
completely collapse, caused severe structural damage to that property 
and a severe fire on the first floor, which spread into the roof space 
of the house next door.

'We used an aerial platform and four jets to extinguish the fire and stop it spreading into the other properties.

Ruins: The remains of mattresses and a sink and the charred skeleton of the staircase are visible at the end terrace house, where the blaze began

Charred: It is thought there was an explosion after the blaze broke out in the end property shortly after 5am today

'There were three casualties - a 74-year-old woman suffering from the effects of smoke who declined hospital treatment, a 38-year-old man suffering a suspected fractured arm and cuts to his head, and a 60-year-old man suffering from the effects of smoke,' Mr Shields said.

Both men were taken to hospital.

'We have also received reports of a fourth resident in that end terraced property but neighbours say that person hasn’t been living there over the past few weeks.

'Police are trying to contact this person’s family to see if they are staying elsewhere and we are searching the property as well.

'Due to the structural damage of the end terraced house it’s not safe enough to send firefighters inside, so we have been using the Urban Search and Rescue Team and search and rescue dog Ace to carry out a systematic search.

'It’s far too early to say what’s happened, but we have been working with National Grid and North West Electricity, who have isolated the services to the row of houses and they are going to assist us with our investigations.

'We also have community safety teams and volunteers at the scene to reassure the community and offer advice.'
