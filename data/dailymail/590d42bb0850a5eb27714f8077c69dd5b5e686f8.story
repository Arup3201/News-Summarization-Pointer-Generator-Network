Their adorable napping photos captured the hearts of people around the world last year.

Now toddler Beau and puppy Theo have been joined by the Shyba family's newest arrival, baby Evangeline, and the images are still melting even the coldest of hearts.

Mother Jessica Shyba has continued her ritual of taking photos of the trio as they sleep - whatever position they are lying in.

Deep asleep: Beau and puppy Theo have been joined by the Shyba family's newest arrival, Evangeline

Relaxed: The trio lie in comfort together, whatever position they might be lying in 

Theo first started taking naps with Beau soon after the Shyba family adopted him in November 2013.

Initially Mrs Shyba intended to crate train the seven-week-old mix breed but after one night of whining, she couldn't bear to let him sleep alone again.

Mrs Shyba says that the nap time routine started on the third day they had Theo.

Theo was laying on Beau when the toddler was getting rocked for his afternoon nap and Theo passed out as well. Talk about killing two birds with one stone.

'I was practically howling at the cuteness and nearly woke them both up,' Mrs Shyba wrote on her blog. 

The next day, Theo waited outside the bedroom for nap time and so began what the mom calls 'the most organic and beautiful relationship I have ever witnessed.'

'Each day, Theo meets us at nap time and waits patiently for beau to fall asleep. By that time, he's also sleepy, so when I hoist him onto our bed, he stumbles over Beau and plops right down on top of him. 

Mrs Shyba's new photo book Naptime with Theo and Beau, will be available on Amazon and other online retailers in February.
