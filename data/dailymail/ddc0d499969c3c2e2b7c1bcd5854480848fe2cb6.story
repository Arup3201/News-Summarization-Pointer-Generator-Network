Ronald Cooke, 67, sold hundreds of vintage and modern police uniforms to film studios and TV companies including  the BBC and ITV

A police uniform trader who sold helmets and truncheons to the BBC, ITV and prestigious theatres has been prosecuted after being unable to prove they were not being bought by potential terrorists.

Ronald Cooke, 67, provided hundreds of vintage and modern police uniforms for film studios and even sold helmets to the National Theatre in London for a number of productions.

The trader from Bordon, Hampshire, was found guilty on eight counts of illegally possessing items of police clothing under the Police Act 1996 and was fined £250 at Bournemouth Crown Court.

His appeal was quashed last week after a judge ruled he had not properly vetted the people he sold the items to and he was ordered to pay a further £300.

Police raided his home last year and seized 236 helmets, 56 baseball caps and 92 helmet badges worth more than £10,000.

Mr Cooke's solicitor Harvey Whittacombe warned that this landmark case could open the floodgates for similar prosecutions against theatres and TV shows like Heartbeat.

Speaking after his conviction, Mr Cooke said he was 'incredibly frustrated' because he supplied the uniforms to the entertainment industry rather than potential criminals.

'Their argument was that I didn't know who I was selling to but I did know. I sell mostly to theatres and film and TV companies,' he said.

'For example, we sold helmets to the National Theatre of Holland for their production of Billy Elliot because they wanted policeman from the miners' strike in the 1980s.

'I also sold some tunics and helmets to the set of a film featuring Michael Caine, as well as to the BBC and ITV and the National Theatre in London.

'Of course I sell to individuals but I always talk to them and I know what they want them for.

'Most of the stock was historic, a lot of it dating back to the 1970s and relating to now-defunct police forces like the Royal Parks Police.

'I trade in a lot of cap badges which are mostly silver and not enamel like the ones used today.

'But now I have been convicted it is case law and I suppose other traders are liable for prosecution.'

'Anybody who has got a police uniform that has not been authorised by the police could be prosecuted.'

Mr Cooke revealed he had sold to most of the theatres in Britain including the National Theatre in London

He sourced the products from eBay, the National Museum of Policing and a specialist wholesale firm and sold them for use as props and to known collectors in the US.

Mr Cooke sold the items online and from his shop Dorset Militaria in Penn Court, West Moors, which closed down in August.

Kevin Hill, representing Cooke at the appeal hearing, tried to argue that his client did not have a responsibility to monitor his buyers and that the Police Act was aimed at people caught in possession of police equipment in suspicious circumstances.

He said: 'Did he intend to do something with these items that was illegal? As he clearly stated at interview, he did not.'

But a judge ruled that he had not taken adequate steps to ensure his buyers were reputable.

Judge James Meston QC said the Act was intended 'for the protection of the public' and 'the maintenance of the integrity of the police service'.

He said the nature of Cooke's business was such that he could not and that he had not taken steps to warn his customers of their legal obligations.

Mr Cooke said he is now planning to take the matter to the High Court as long as he could secure the funding. 

His solicitor Mr Whittacombe said: 'Anybody who has got a police uniform that has not been authorised by the police could be prosecuted.

'All sorts of people have police uniforms for the purposes of fooling members of the public.

'When you watch Heartbeat there are people in uniforms designed to fool the watching public.

'Many of the items that Mr Cooke had came from museums and other items came from various websites like eBay.

'If he is guilty then it stands to reason that all these other people must be guilty as well.

'We are surprised that the police haven't yet gone after these people, it doesn't make sense. If he is doing wrong than the others must be doing the same thing.

'The CPS suggested certain people are authorised to have uniforms but we cannot find any law or act where you get that authorisation.

'It seems the CPS went after Mr Cooke to try and a test case.

'Of course they are worried about people impersonating police officers but there are separate laws that deal with that.

'There is no case law for this so Mr Cooke's case is a first.'
