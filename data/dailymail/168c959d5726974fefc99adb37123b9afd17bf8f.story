The woman who is accused of almost 100 sex acts with a 15-year-old actively sought schoolboys for sex, according to
police in Florida.

Alysia
Flynn is a former police officer and mother who feared she had become pregnant
by her teenage lover.

The 32-year-old is charged with nearly 100 offences of having sex with the teen.

On the prowl: Alysia Flynn, 32, has been charged with almost 100 offences of underage sex with a 15-year-old boy

Investigators
said she hosted drink and drug-fuelled parties at her home in Viera, Florida,
and fear there are other young victims.

'From
what we've uncovered so far from interviews, were pretty confident there are
other victims, and it's not an isolated incident,' said Lt. Tod Goodyear.

'It
appears we've got a woman in her 30s actively looking for high school
boys.'

Flynn was
charged with dozens of offences following an investigation that began after the
parents of the 15-year-old boy she was having sex with learned about their
son's affair.

Enabling: Police also allege that Flynn held raucous house parties where she gave minors drugs and alcohol

During their inquiries detectives 
discovered that Flynn had been having sex with the boy at her home, as 
well as other locations.

Court
papers obtained by WFTV in Orlando reveal that when Flynn's mobile phone was
seized it was found to contain naked photos of her lover.

Police said
this could lead to further charges of child pornography.

WFTV also
said the court documents show that the boy's parents were aware of the
relationship for over a year.

Other
parents were also concerned that Flynn was involved with an underage student
who played for his High School football team.

They
claimed to the TV station they tipped off school officials about the affair
after one of the coaches overheard students talking about Flynn's sexual
relationship with members of the football team.

The Brevard County Sheriff's Office has issued an appeal to members of the public with information about Flynn to come forward.

Flynn was
charged with 42 counts of lewd and lascivious battery and 53 counts of unlawful
sexual activity with minors, contributing to the delinquency of a minor and
interference with child custody.
