Turned off: The First Lady revealed on CBS's Late Show that she did not watch the Republican Convention - but said others should, to help make up their minds on how to vote

Michelle Obama has revealed she is not watching this week's Republican National Convention - but encouraged others to tune in.

The First Lady admitted to her partisan viewing habits on CBS's Late Show with David Letterman last night.

She told the host that she did not normally watch the convention because of her position as President Barack Obama's wife.

However, she encouraged every U.S. citizen to follow both the Democrat and Republican political conventions to help them decide which presidential candidate to vote for in November.

'As the wife of the guy the Republicans are running against, I tend not to watch it,' she said.

'But I think it's important for everyone to 
watch these conventions because this is the time you get to know the 
party, you understand the platform, you understand the candidates.'

She added: 'You know, this is technically where the
campaign begins, so I think it's very important for everyone to watch 
as much of both conventions as possible to make their decisions. I 
didn't watch it, but…'

Vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan was the star of the convention yesterday with a rousing speech comparing Obama's presidency to ‘a ship trying to sail on yesterday’s wind’.

Two of the Party's more established members also took to the podium in Tampa last night.

Condoleezza Rice, President George W. Bush’s Secretary of State, was lauded for her speeches of foreign policy while former presidential nominee Senator John McCain attacked Obama over the scheduled withdrawal from Afghanistan, strained tensions with Israel, and a lackluster support for rebels in Syria and Iran.

Mrs Obama's appearance on the Late Show was part of her back-to-school media tour, where she is discussing ways for parents to help prepare their children to return to the classroom.

Balanced view: The 48-year-old mother of two insisted every U.S. citizen should watch both main parties' convention to help make up their minds on how to vote

Dressed in a belted black sleeveless 
dress, the 48-year-old tackled a range of subjects as she joked and 
chatted openly with Letterman.

She talked about her Let's Move campaign, which promotes healthy eating among today's young people, as well as the progress made by her initiative to help veterans find work.

The mother of two even discussed how she has let daughters Malia and Sasha go to camp 
for four weeks for the first time this summer.

Meanwhile, more than 26,000 people 
showed up to hear the president speak during his three-state college 
town tour this week, which ended yesterday with a rally near the 
University of Virginia.
