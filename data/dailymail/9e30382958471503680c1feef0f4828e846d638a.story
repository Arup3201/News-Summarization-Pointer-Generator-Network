Totally accurate: Statistician Nate Silver correctly called all 50 states in the US Presidential election using a unique mathematical formula

To every politico, pundit and punter from Seattle to Miami, this was a Presidential election contest between two candidates separated only by a hair’s breadth.

‘It is a toss-up,’ the pundits said. ‘Too close to call.’ Barack Obama against Mitt Romney was so tightly-fought that sitting on the fence was the only way of avoiding being openly pilloried.

But one analyst has won nationwide acclaim in America after trusting in his highly complex power of prediction to call Obama’s resounding victory with stunning accuracy.

Nate Silver, a 34-year-old statistician who at one time made a living from playing poker, correctly predicted all the states declared so far in what was billed as the tightest election race in decades.

Silver’s FiveThirtyEight blog on the New York Times website became essential reading in the last few days before Tuesday’s election as his reputation grew as a pundit prepared to stick his neck out.

His highly mathematical approach - which has echoes of the book and Brad Pitt film about baseball statistics ‘Moneyball’ - involves running hundreds of calculations for each state based on myriad factors, including election results from the past and polling data.

Silver, an avowed Obama supporter, used his ‘magic formula’ to predict the President’s re-election well before the first results came through.

He calculated there was a 90.9 per cent likelihood of an Obama win and that the President would win 332 Electoral College seats compared to 206 for Romney – correct if the Democrat wins Florida, which has yet to declare.

His accuracy has drawn widespread praise in the US. MSNBC television host Rachel Maddow said during election coverage: ‘You know who win the election tonight? Nate Silver.’

Chris Taylor, writing a blog on the Politico site, said: ‘Here is the absolute, undoubted winner of this election: Nate Silver and big data.’

One comedian took to Twitter to call him ‘The Emperor of Math.’

While the value of statistical analysis has long been appreciated in sport – Silver himself started out studying baseball data – it has long been rejected in politics, where pundits rely on ‘gut feeling’ to call the results.

But after this week, Silver suddenly finds himself as the poster boy for a new ‘Moneyball’ approach to election punditry.

Taylor went on to proclaim: ‘What does this victory mean? That mathematical model can no longer be derided by ‘gut-feeling’ pundits.

‘That’s Silver’s contention – TV pundits are generally no more accurate than a coin toss – must now be given wider credence.’

John Sides, a political scientist at George Washington University, went further: ‘It shows that we can use systematic data – economic data, polling data – to separate momentum from no-mentum, to dispense with the gaseous emanations of pundits’ ‘guts’, and ultimately to forecast the winner.’

But Silver beating the traditional pollsters shouldn’t have come as a surprise – in the 2008 election, he was right on 49 out of the 50 states and all 35 Senate contests.

The following year, Time magazine named him one of the world’s most influential people.

His stock is now higher than ever. The New York Times public editor Margaret Sullivan called him their ‘most high-profile writer at this particular moment.’

Twenty per cent of visits to the NY Times website in the build-up to the election included a look at his blog.

Silver, born in Lansing, Michigan, graduated from the University of Chicago with a degree in economics after spending his third year of study at the London School of Economics.

He briefly worked as a Chicago-based consultant for KPMG, though later described it as ‘a job I didn’t like’. In his spare time, he developed a program for projecting baseball player performance called Pecota.

Silver resigned from KPMG in April 2004, having become a writer for the website Baseball Prospectus, to whom he sold his Pecota system in return for a partnership interest.

Prior to the 2008 election, he switched to politics, saying: ‘In politics, there’s a lot of partisan screaming and conventional wisdom that’s conventional but not very wise.’

No chance: Silver was widely ridiculed when his calculations gave Republican challenger Mitt Romney just a 10 per cent chance of victory

In 2010, his existing blog at FiveThirtyEight.com was bought by the NY Times and Silver revealed his models for predicting election results, based on a combination of electoral history, demographics and polling.

In the early part of 2012, it became more and more clear that Silver was backing Obama to win a second term, drawing criticism of his methods from Romney supporters and right-wing pundits.

Even others within the NY Times expressed doubts – the highly-respected columnist David Brooks wrote: ‘If there’s one thing we know, it’s that experts with fancy computer models are terrible at predicting human behaviour.’

MSNBC Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough called him ‘a joke’, and summed up the views of most pundits by adding: ‘anyone that thinks that this race is anything but a toss-up right not is such an ideologue, they should be kept away from typewriters, computers, laptops and microphones for the next ten days.’

Silver challenged Scarborough to a bet on Twitter, saying: ‘If you think it’s a toss-up, let’s bet. If Obama wins, you donate $1,000 to the American Red Cross. If Romney wins, I do. Deal?’

His predictions prevailed and won a new respect for statistical methods. But there was no election night triumphalism from Silver. In his final blog post, he simply wrote: ‘There’s a lot more to unpack in the coming days, but first, we’re going to get some sleep and grab a beer.’
