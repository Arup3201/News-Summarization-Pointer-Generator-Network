Would the average M&S woman buy a kimono? Would its 50-something customer ever, voluntarily, try on a crop top?

These two things are what M&S’s new style supremo Belinda Earl is banking on. And she launched her vision for the women of Middle England yesterday in grand style, with the unveiling of her collection for spring/summer 2014.

Floodlights illuminated a honey-stoned former church in London’s Regent’s Park, while handpicked members of the fashion press were served elegant trays of canapes and prosecco on tap.

There was even a goodie bag containing an Italian vase.

Would the average M&S woman buy a kimono? Would its 50-something customer ever, voluntarily, try on a crop top? Liz Jones gives her brutally honest opinion on M&S's new drop

You can’t say Earl’s not trying. And while you’d think she’d be pouring sweat given that womenswear sales dropped, again, in the three months until September, she oozed calm.

‘I’m not losing sleep,’ she told me. ‘Yes, I’ve been surprised at the attention on me since I joined M&S, but it’s a public company. Everyone has an opinion about us.’

She was keen, though, to distance herself from the humourless, much derided Leading Ladies autumn ad campaign, featuring Tracey Emin, Helen Mirren et al, stressing that she has no input into the marketing of her critically, if not commercially, well-received clothes. 

So, is the M&S CEO Marc Bolland insisting Earl work five days a week, not her usual three? ‘No, definitely not. But my smartphone is always vibrating.’

Is she at least beginning to achieve what she set out to do, having been in the hot seat for more than a year? (She joined M&S, after heading up Debenhams and Jaeger, in September 2012.) 

Designer: I think this ensemble is very Alexander McQueen - and you can do up the coat to make it look less 'fashion' if you like (Limited Edition trench, £79, white collarless shirt, £22.50, black skirt, £29, and black sandals with block heels, £29.50)

Flattering: This tuxedo waistcoat is slimming and could be worn over anything - but I worry the top is too revealing (Limited Edition Collection tuxedo waistcoat, £59, top £35, trousers £39.50, shoes £49.50 and leather tote £79)

Limited edition: This best of British collection is pricey and only a few hundred of each piece will be produced (soft wool cocoon coat £249, top, £69, and skirt, £79)

Soft leathers: These buttery soft leather pieces will be instant sell-outs, but they will snapped up only by the fashion pack (£249, leather pencil skirt, £149, collarless shirt £39.50, and red shoes £99)

‘Absolutely,’ she said. ‘As promised, we are rolling out a more spacious shop floor design across the country, training staff to be more confident about offering styling advice and we have a welcome zone in each store, with mannequins displaying key trends.’

I wonder if she isn’t galled that even in the weeks after the collapse of the garment factory in Bangladesh, other stores saw sales soar, while M&S, which has a policy of never using factories more than two storeys high, has seen them plummet?

‘It’s frustrating, but we’re not going to abandon our ethical stance: that is what customers expect from us,’ said Earl.

Surely, though, she has made some mistakes, such as offering too many lines and, more importantly, introducing sky-high prices (a British wool pea coat for winter is £349, while a small pink leather satchel is £299!). 

Liz's favourite: This is the best dress I've seen in years: Short sleeves, ruching to cover the tummy and a gorgeous mesh overlay fabric (M&S Collection lace mesh overlay dress, £45, clutch, £25, and shoes £19.50)

Think pink: I like a soft leather T-shirt and these cotton cigarette are are cut well but the colour's rather garish (Per Una Speziale top, £169, trousers, £59, and shoes £29.50)

But yesterday Earl refused to admit she might not be on the right path: ‘Women want real choice, newness. And that pea coat sold extremely well, by the way.’

Ah, but what about Marc Bolland’s comment last week in response to certain must-haves, such as the notorious powder blue coat, selling out, saying key pieces were ‘carefully managed’ so as not to become ubiquitous?

Earl then lapsed into marketing speak: ‘It’s all about potentialising it. It’s not our purpose to restrict [a garment], but about creating a tension, a balance.’

 My big worry is that M&S’s new collection is all too high fashion. I mean short, swishy skater  skirts. M&S, you cannot be serious!

She pooh-poohed, too, claims that M&S’s regional stores are still the poor relation to those in the big cities. ‘You can buy every piece online and have it delivered to your home or your nearest store. There is no problem,’ she said.

And herein lies the rub. While the spring collection is gorgeous, with so many pieces reminding me of designers such as Jil Sander, Helmut Lang, hell, even Alexander McQueen, I wonder that the core customer might feel sidelined — women who don’t own a computer, much less shop online.

Much I saw yesterday will undoubtedly garner glowing plaudits in the fashion press: a cutaway McQueen-style black trench, cream tuxedo waistcoat, pink leather biker with chunky ribbed sleeves, pencil skirts in sky blue or lemon (guaranteed to sell out in days, despite the £149 price tag),  cream waffle skirt, chunky knits, sweatshirts, a lemon dress in mesh with ruching at the tummy.

And the shoes have improved ten-fold: silver, pointy stilettos, black sandals with block heels.M&S’s Best Of British range, which is rather preppy, features gorgeous cropped black trousers, a tweedy summer coat (£249) you could wear to the smartest of weddings and silk shirts. 

This outfit belongs in Zara: The skater skirt comes straight from the Eighties while the peach jacket it too boxy. (M&S Collection jacket, £79, top, £22.50, and skirt £39.50. The leather bag, £99, and two-tone pumps £25, will be wardrobe staples for years)

No-go: Oh dear, Twiggy might look lovely in this kimono jacket and wide culottes, but those of us who are more branch-like will feel very wide indeed (Twiggy for M&S Collection kimono jacket £69, Per Una culottes, £45 and shoes, £29.50)

God is in the details: silk linings, extra-long zips, classy gold metallic labels. But, but, BUT! My big worry is that M&S’s new collection is all too high fashion.

I mean short, swishy skater  skirts. M&S, you cannot be serious!

Crop tops that will show off your tummy and cropped trousers that suit only those with the legs of a flamingo. Trendy sandals, with a wide ankle strap, that only shorten the leg.

While its silk kimono blouse is lovely and could be worn by a woman of any age, the kimono wrap jacket is too bulky. Yes, there is a gorgeous metallic, spaghetti-strapped slip dress on sale, but only those with Kate Moss’s body could possibly pull it off.

The new white voluminous skirts with sheer stripes feel very Topshop — which is exactly where they belong.

Of course, it all appeals to skinny fashionistas like me, but we are not the core customer. I doubt, too, there are enough of us to keep M&S shareholders happy. 

So if this spring/summer collection, which hits stores in January, doesn’t lift sales of clothing, will Belinda be out on her ear?

She laughed when I said this. ‘No. I’m very confident. This is a journey.’  But the thing is that fashion moves so swiftly and the M&S customer’s patience is notoriously so thin that time may be running out.

If I were in Belinda’s shoes, I’d be working seven days a week and putting my phone on Loud…
