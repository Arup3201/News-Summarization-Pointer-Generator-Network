Price prediction patriarch: Eugene Fama showed decades ago that stock prices are easier to predict years in advance than within a few days

Americans Eugene Fama, Lars Peter Hansen and Robert Shiller won the Nobel prize for economics on Monday for developing new methods to study trends in asset markets.

The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the three had laid the foundation of the current understanding of asset prices by developing a prediction model based on fluctuations in risk, risk attitudes and how they interact with behavioral biases and market friction.

‘The Laureates have laid the foundation for the current understanding of asset prices,’ the organization said in a statement announcing the winners.

Mr Fama’s study of the financial markets began in the 1960s. He soon theorized that, while stock prices are hard to predict in the short-term, it is actually less difficult to predict long-term fluctuations.

He also proved that 'value' and small-cap stocks provide better returns than 'growth' stocks, Bloomberg noted.

Building on the revelations made by Mr Fama, 74, Mr Schiller proved that stock prices are much more volatile than dividends paid by a company since they tend to fall as the ratio between them grows.

Dividends are based mainly on a company’s performance, but stock prices can be influenced by any number of factors, just one of which is performance.

"These findings, which might seem surprising and contradictory, were made and analyzed by this year's laureates," the academy said.

Housing guru: Robert Schiller's work led to the creation of the S&P/Case-Schiller housing price index, as well as index funds

Mr Schiller’s 1980s proof of theory led to innovations such as index funds. Similar to mutual funds, these investment vehicles have become popular alternatives to financial advisors for individual investors, Bloomberg noted.

His findings also apply to the bond markets.

Further proof of Mr Schiller’s impact on the financial world are the S&P/Case-Schiller home price indexes created with Karl Case.

Despite his revolutionary findings, Mr Schiller was in disbelief he won.

'I did not expect it,' he said via phone during a press conference announcing the winners, according to Bloomberg.

Proof of the last decade’s housing bubble can be seen with home prices doubling in the years leading up to 2006 before cratering during the Great Recession.

Building on the work of predecessors, and in compliment to the two men he shares this year’s Nobel with, Mr Hansen’s research led to the rational investor theory.

Mr Hansen set out to show how a rational investor might react when faced with long-term asset price uncertainty, and concluded that borrowing limits and risk restrictions prevent smart investors from trading in mispriced markets.

These findings have led to modern risk controls and long-term risk predictions.

Deviations from this theory are able to explain buying and selling in just about any market condition.

Mr Fama and Mr Hansen, 60, are associated with the University of Chicago. Mr Shiller, 67, is a professor at Yale University.

American researchers have dominated the economics awards in recent years; the last time there was no American among the winners was in 1999.

The Nobel committees have now announced all six of the annual $1.2 million awards for 2013.

The economics award is not a Nobel Prize in the same sense as the medicine, chemistry, physics, literature and peace prizes, which were created by Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel in 1895. 

The inventor of dynamite, Mr Nobel died only a year later.

Sweden's central bank added the economics prize in 1968 as a memorial to Nobel.
