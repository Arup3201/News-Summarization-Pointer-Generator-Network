The family of a teenager who has been missing for two days have made an emotional appeal for her to come home.

Nisha Mazhar's parents made the plea to their 13-year-old daughter who has not been seen since disappearing from Woking, Surrey.

Police have released two CCTV images of the teenager walking through a subway underneath Woking Station on the day she disappeared.

Last sighting: Nisha Mazhar was captured on secruity cameras walking through a subway at Woking Station on the same day she disappeared

She is understood to have boarded a bus replacement service to Guilford, which is eight miles away.

Surrey Police said her behaviour is out of character and officers are growing increasingly concerned for her welfare.

Missing: Nisha's parents have said they are not angry with her and want to know the schoolgirl is 'safe and well'

Her parents Mazhar Iqbal and 
Shazia Najib said: 'Nisha, we all love you. We are not angry, we just 
need to know that you are safe and well.

'We want you to come home. Please contact the police, family, friends, anyone.

'Please just let us know you are safe. We are extremely worried.

'Your dad has come from Birmingham to be with you. He loves you and cares for you. We need you home.'Your brothers are missing you. We all want and need you with us.

'If anybody has seen or heard anything, please contact the police as soon as possible.'

Nisha was last seen at about 9.30am on Sunday.

She is Asian, about 5ft 5in, slim, with long, dark brown hair.

She
 is believed to have been wearing black leggings or trousers, a dark 
grey top, a black three-quarter-length coat with a white scarf, and 
brown Ugg boots, a force spokesman said.
