An inquiry into the death of Alexander Litvinenko has been shown photographs of the Russian spy walking around the hotel where he was given a fatal dose of polonium.

The 43-year-old had been called to the Millenium Hotel in Mayfair on November 1 2006 to meet murder suspects Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitri Kovtun, the inquiry heard. 

He died three weeks later having drunk a cup of poison-laced tea at the meeting which was moved at the last minute by one of the Russian businessmen. 

Lugovoi and Kovtun deny any involvement in the former KGB agent's death and have failed to return to the UK to face questioning.

An inquiry into Alexander Litvinenko's death was shown these images of the former spy arriving at the London hotel where two Russian businessman are accused of giving him a lethal dose of polonium

Today the London inquiry, led by Sir Robert Owen, was shown CCTV footage of the three men in the hotel in the hours leading up the meeting. 

It shows Lugovoi checking into the hotel on Halloween in 2006 before Kovtun arrives the following morning. 

The pair are seen making separate trips to the toilets some ten minutes apart shortly before Mr Litvinenko arrives in the lobby. 

'Extremely high' traces of the radioactive substance found on the spy's jacket after his death were also discovered in the toilets which the men visited separately.

The inquiry heard how before travelling to London, Kovtun told a friend he planned to 'lure' Mr Litvinenko to the hotel to poison him.

'While he had been in Hamburg, Mr Kovtun had made touch with one particular of his old friends from a restaurant where he used to work, and asked that person if he was aware of anybody working in in a restaurant in London,' said Andrew O’Connor, counsel to the inquiry. 

'As part of that conversation he said he wanted to poison Mr Litvinenko.'

Detective Inspector Craig Mascall replied: 'I think Mr Kovtun, his words were that he wanted to lure Mr Litvinenko out to a meeting in order to poison him.' 

On November 1, Lugovoi and Kovtun visited the late Russian businessman Boris Berezovsky to collect football tickets for a match that evening. 

They then appeared at the hotel to meet with Mr Litvinenko at around 4pm. 

Three weeks later he died in hospital of radioactive poisoning. A post mortem examination into his death was described as one of the most dangerous to have ever been carried out in the UK. 

The day before he died Mr Litvinenko insisted photographs be taken of him to 'prove he had been killed by Putin and by the Kremlin'

Mr Litvinenko fell ill in a matter of days after the meeting. He was admitted to hospital where he died three weeks later from radioactive poisoning 

Mr Litvinenko had travelled to the UK in 2000 after becoming disillusioned with Putin's Russia where he had worked in the Federal Security Service, formerly the KGB. 

He was granted political asylum after arriving in London with his family and later began working on a consultant basis for MI5 and MI6 according to his wife.  

But having alleged criminal activity in the Kremlin, he became fearful for his life and in the days after the meeting became convinced he was the target of a murder attempt. 

His health rapidly deteriorated, with Metropolitan Police discovering traces of the highly toxic chemical polonium-210 in addresses across London. 

Earlier this week the inquiry heard how he had been warned of threats against his life but 'ignored' them. 

Mario Scaramella told of how the pair received an email in the days before Mr Litvinenko's meeting, but that he was 'more interested in his food' than any threats. 

'We started to talk about general issues and then I said "let's talk seriously,"' Mr Scaramella said.

'He was more focused about his food than the email.

'I was saying "This is a serious issue". He said "I have to check"'. 

Kovtun and Lugovoi deny having any part in the former spy's death. The pair have refused to return to the UK to face police questioning
