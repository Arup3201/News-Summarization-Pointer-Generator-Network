The time it takes to diagnose dementia is to be slashed from 18 months to just three following a scientific breakthrough.

David Cameron will this week announce the creation of a chain of brain clinics to end the agony of those who find out they have Alzheimer’s when it is too late for help.

Experts say early diagnosis will give those suffering from the early stages of dementia 18 months of extra independent living, transforming the lives of hundreds of thousands of vulnerable and elderly.

Needing treatment: Thousands of dementia sufferers go without care because their condition goes undiagnosed

More than 400,000 people in Britain are suffering from dementia but are denied the care and support they need because their condition is undiagnosed – in part because they have to wait a year and a half for it to be confirmed.

But new technology, which will receive the Prime Minister’s backing this Thursday, will mean those suffering from memory loss or other potential symptoms will have their condition diagnosed in a sixth of the time.

Vow: Prime Minister David Cameron had pledged to preserve pensioners' benefits for the lifetime of this parliament

Patients at risk will be able to do a series of tests on an iPad in the comfort of their local GP’s office.

In only ten minutes the software can determine the difference between people with normal and abnormal memory.

Those at risk would then be referred to an NHS brain health centre where they would have more extensive memory tests while hooked up to an MRI scanner.

A new computer program can detect signs of dementia such as brain shrinkage and damage to blood vessels that can affect memory. The results would be beamed back to the GP.

The Government is also investing in a 
series of mobile diagnostic clinics which will park outside GP 
surgeries, so people can be tested on their own doorstep.

The rate of successful diagnosis is 
expected to double from 42 per cent at present to 80 per cent – a target
set by Mr Cameron earlier this year when he launched a Challenge on 
Dementia.

The PM has pledged to launch a campaign against Alzheimer’s to match the war on Aids in the 1980s and 1990s.

It is estimated that by 2020 there will be nearly one million people with dementia, rising from the current level of 670,000.

Mr Cameron said last night: ‘Dementia is a devastating disease that puts enormous strain on people and their families.

Early intervention: Six out of ten people living with dementia in the UK currently have not received a diagnosis, research found. (Posed by model)

‘Prompt
diagnosis makes an enormous difference to dementia sufferers.

This 
ground-breaking work from UK scientists and companies could change lives
for the better and it underlines to the world that Britain is great for
research and for business.’

The
Government is investing £39million in the pilot project via a fund 
called Biomedical Catalyst that backs small and medium-sized businesses 
and universities to accelerate the development of most 
technologically-advanced healthcare.

The first ‘Brain Health Centre’ will 
be established at the Memory Clinic at Maudsley Hospital in South 
London.

The mobile van will run trials in Sussex. If they are a success 
they will be rolled out nationwide.

The
Alzheimer’s Society will support the project by ensuring the needs of 
patients and their carers are fully considered in the project, and by 
undertaking an initial impact assessment on the 200 patients assessed in
the two trial Brain Health Centres.

Six
out of ten people living with dementia in the UK have not received a 
diagnosis.

Experts say the problem is that many people have never raised
the problem with their GP, or may have been misdiagnosed, or are simply
waiting for a diagnosis.

The current way a patient is diagnosed with dementia is both unwieldy and lengthy.

In fact, there is no set referral pathway for those who complain about memory problems to their GP.

A doctor may ask the patient to come back in a few months, may put the problem down to old age, or may conduct a basic pencil and paper memory test.

Eventually a patient may be referred to a memory clinic, where other GPs will identify whether a problem exists.

At that point the patient may be diagnosed, may be sent for a brain scan, or may be referred to a psychiatrist or neurologist in a regional centre.

Guidelines mean patients should not wait more than 18 weeks for an appointment with a specialist, but high demand means it often takes much longer.

Once they have an appointment at a hospital – usually in a major city or specialist hospital – they could have to travel long distances to get there.

Usually the patient will then be given a memory test, and may, but not always, have an MRI or CT scan. The test is assessed by a neurologist or a psychiatrist.

Any brain scans are assessed by a radiologist, who uses their expertise to judge whether there is a problem.

At that point the patient may get a diagnosis. The whole process from start to finish can take up to 18 months.

Under the proposed system, any patient with memory problems will be given a ten-minute test by a GP, using newly developed software on an iPad. It will immediately identify whether a patient is at risk of dementia.

They hope the proposed system will make diagnoses quicker and more accurate – and the ease and access to scanners will mean people are not put off seeking help.

The Alzheimer’s Disease International 
charity says earlier diagnosis allows those with dementia to plan ahead 
while they still have the capacity, and crucially, make decisions about 
their own care.

Early 
interventions can also allow doctors to improve cognitive function, 
treat depression and delay institutionalisation – giving a patient more 
time to live independently.

High
blood pressure and a lack of exercise have also been linked to the 
onset of the dementia, and researchers are investigating whether early 
changes to lifestyle may slow the progression of the disease.

Jeremy
Hughes, chief executive at the Alzheimer’s Society, said: ‘There are 
800,000 people living with dementia in the UK, but fewer than half of 
people with the condition have a diagnosis.

As numbers double and costs 
soar, developing new and earlier ways of diagnosing the condition is 
imperative.

‘This 
technology could potentially reduce the time people need to wait for a 
diagnosis significantly.

After diagnosis, we also need to ensure that 
people are supported with information and services to enable them to 
gain the full benefits and support that a diagnosis can give.’

Professor Alistair Burns, the national
clinical director for dementia, said: ‘Combining innovative 
technologies in this way should help us to spot early signs of dementia,
giving us time to offer patients better support and care.’

The
project is being run by the companies IXICO and Cambridge Cognition, 
which developed the iPad software, in partnership with King’s College 
London, the Universities of Brighton and Sussex and Imperial College London.
