America and Britain have been accused of leaving hostages to die and keeping families in the dark about their fate by the father of a man held captive by Isis.

Following the murder of US hostage Peter Kassig families of freed hostages demanded to know why America and Britain did not do more to secure his release.

Hostages from France, Denmark and Turkey are understood to have been freed following negotiations.

A video released by Isis yesterday purports to show 26-year-old Mr Kassig being beheaded along with 18 Syrian soldiers.

The father of a former hostage who was held in Syria by the extremists told MailOnline: ‘There does not seem to be any coordination between major powers such as Britain, America and countries like France who are prepared to deal with the terrorists.

Ed and Paula Kassig, whose son Peter was killed according to a video released by Isis this weekend, have appealed for the video not to be watched

‘Accordingly families are kept in the dark about what is happening to their loved ones. They feel powerless in the struggle to see them freed.’

Asking not to be identified for security reasons, the father added: ‘On the one hand countries like France are clearly negotiating with IS, and getting their hostages freed, while with the Americans and the British it’s the complete opposite’.

A former hostage who was held in Syria who also asked not to be named said: ‘Nobody seems to know what they’re doing – the Americans and British in particular come across as incompetent and unfeeling, with no coordinated policy.

'Britain used to negotiate with terrorists groups like the IRA - all kinds of deals were done. We're dealing with human lives here - we can't just leave people to be killed in the most horrific circumstances imaginable.’

Such views were backed up by Nicolas Hénin, a French journalist held in Syria for 10 months before being freed with three fellow countrymen in April this year.

The Frenchmen at one point shared a cell with James Foley, another US hostage who has decapitated by IS killers, aged 40.

Hénin has visited the Foley family in Rochester, New Hampshire, since and said they were ‘very disillusioned, extremely disappointed with the policies in general.’ 

'Hope the next family is better treated': Nicolas Henin, a French journalist who was held hostage by Islamic State, says the families of US victims need to be looked after more carefully

He said members of the Foley family ‘were buffeted by the government, they weren’t supported, they had very little communication, either from the State Department or the FBI’.

He said the Foley family were ‘a lot more reasonable than all the soap powder sellers who came every day to try and exploit his image, the memory of the son, in selling this or that cause.’

Mr Hénin was released with three fellow countrymen – Édouard Elias, Didier François and Pierre Torrès.

While France has always insisted it does not pay ransoms to groups like IS, there have been well documented claims that millions in cash has been handed over through middle men.

Mr Hénin has always insisted that his release was secured through ‘negotiation’ by the French government with his kidnappers – something the British and Americans refuse to do.

They believe that paying ransoms encourages more kidnappings, and provides massive funding to murderous groups such as IS.

Mr Foley’s family received a message warning that he would be killed after his captors demanded a ransom of $132m in 2013.

While not calling for ransoms to be paid, Mr Hénin said the Foleys hoped that ‘those close to the next Americans who are taken hostage are better treated.’

Confirming Mr Kassig’s death on Sunday, US President Barack Obama said IS, which now controls a third of Iraq and Syria, 'revels in the slaughter of innocents, including Muslims, and is bent only on sowing death and destruction.'

It followed an emotional statement from Mr Kassig’'s parents about the fate of their 'treasured' son, who was captured by IS last October.

In the release, Ed and Paula Kassig, from Indianapolis, said they hoped their son would be remembered for his 'important work' and his love for others.

US National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said the country was 'appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American.'

Meanwhile, British Prime Minister David Cameron said he was 'horrified by the cold blooded murder' of Mr Kassig and claimed that IS militants 'have again shown their depravity'.

Mr Kassig was captured in Syria in October last year while providing medical training and humanitarian aid to victims of the country's conflict.
