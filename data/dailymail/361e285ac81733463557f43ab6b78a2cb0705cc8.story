Barack Obama called up some celebrity reinforcement for his last day of campaigning before tomorrow's election as he was joined on stage by rock legend Bruce Springsteen and rapper Jay-Z.

The hip-hop star even changed his lyrics to take a jab at the President's Republican rival Mitt Romney, rapping: 'I got 99 problems but Mitt ain't one.'

He told the crowd in Columbus, Ohio that when Obama asked him to perform at the campaign rally, he replied: 'Michelle is coming?'

Earlier the President appeared with Springsteen in Madison, Wisconsin in a last-minute attempt to shore up his lead in the Midwestern swing state.

However, the pair drew a crowd just a quarter of the size of that drawn by Springsteen and John Kerry in 2004.

Obama and the Boss then travelled on Air Force One together to Ohio and Iowa, with Springsteen playing a short set before Obama delivers his campaign speech.

The two musical legends were joined by nearly 200 other well-known 'surrogates' for Obama lending their voices to the last day of his re-election effort.

The Boss played his hit Land of Hope and Dreams in front of a crowd of 18,000 on Monday morning, before rousing them with a speech in support of the President.

He said that Obama had run on an optimistic message of change in 2008, but now faced 'a world that challenges your hopefulness'.

Springsteen also joked that although he was proud to support the President's re-election, 'that first debate really freaked me out'.

However, while the mood was festive, either Springsteen or Obama appeared to have lost some star power, as the turnout was sharply reduced compared to similar events in the past.

The rocker appeared with Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry in Madison in 2004, and drew a crowd of 80,000.

And in 2008, 50,000 supporters turned out to watch the Boss promote Obama's campaign in Columbus, Ohio.

Today's crowd of 18,000 was even dwarfed by an Obama solo appearance in Madison on Sunday, when 30,000 people gathered to hear him speak at the University of Wisconsin campus.

Luckily for Obama, Springsteen was not the only celebrity pulling for him on the day before the presidential election.

The Hollywood Reporter obtained a list of 181 public figures who had joined the President's campaign and agreed to help sway the few remaining undecided voters.

Anne Hathaway, Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson are all calling in to radio stations to get the message out, while Neil Diamond manned phone banks for Obama on Sunday.

Mariah Carey and Ricky Martin hit the campaign trail in person, joining Michelle Obama at events in Florida.

Other stars associated with the re-election campaign include Stevie Wonder, Katy Perry, Brandon Routh and Sheryl Crow.

Mitt Romney has his own roster of celebrities, including Kid Rock, Meat Loaf and Clint Eastwood.

He has also drawn the apparent support of troubled actress Lindsay Lohan, who is prone to impromptu political rants via Twitter.
