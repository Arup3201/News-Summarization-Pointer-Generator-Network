Britons can still find bargain summer holidays in Europe - because the prices of food, drink and entertainment in some of the most popular resorts have plummeted.

The drop in prices are a result of bars and restaurants competing for custom while holiday budgets shrink.

Despite the pound struggling against the euro, holidaymakers heading off to Crete will find that prices have fallen by almost a fifth.

The price of food, drink and entertainment in Crete, Greece, has fallen by almost a fifth since last year

Sunny Beach in Bulgaria was the cheapest resort in Europe at £76.35 for holiday essentials

Meanwhile, those going to the Costa del Sol will save 15.3 per cent compared with the same time last year.

A
Post Office survey compared the cost of 12 holiday essentials, 
including sun cream, a three-course meal for a family of four, a glass 
of wine and a pedalo ride.

The cheapest resort in Europe was Sunny Beach in Bulgaria, where the items cost £76.35, followed by the Costa del Sol at £77.68 and Mallorca in Spain at £91.02, according to the Post Office Holiday Costs Barometer.

The holiday essentials added up to £96.27 in the Algarve, Portugal, and only 30p more in Marmaris, Turkey.

Britons who opt for somewhere a little closer to home will pay the price, with costs in Bournemouth rising 11.8 per cent to £139.28 since the summer of 2012.

A three-course meal for a family of four cost £30 in Mallorca while the equivalent in Sorrento, Italy, costs about £107.05.

But those heading to Corfu and Cyprus, 
ranked as sixth and seventh in Britons' favoured destinations in the 
report, will find prices have risen by 5.5 per cent and 6.5 per cent 
respectively.

Andrew Brown of Post Office Travel Money
said: 'The good news for families is that there is strong competition 
for business in many resorts – particularly between restaurants and bars
– and this has resulted in lower prices in some holiday hotspots. '

Spain's Costa del Sol is the second cheapest resort in Europe, with prices plunging by 15.3 per cent compared with last year

A Post Office spokesman said: 'Sterling may be worth over nine per cent less than a year 
ago against the euro but price cuts in resorts surveyed in Spain, 
Portugal and Greece as well as in Bulgaria have been big enough to 
counteract the weak pound and mean families will pay less than last year
for typical holiday purchases.'

Travel expert Simon Calder told the Daily Express: 'The crucial thing is to choose 
destinations where the pound will stretch. It is the combination of cost
of the trip and cost on the ground.

'The
best values can be found in Greece and Cyprus where some packages have 
been cut to £300 for a week, and the pound will go further when you are 
there.'
