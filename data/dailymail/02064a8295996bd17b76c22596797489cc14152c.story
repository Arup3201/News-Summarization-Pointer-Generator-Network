A former campaign spokeswoman for John Edwards broke down on the stand today as she described how close friend Elizabeth Edwards told her one of her fears of dying was that there would be no man there who loved her.

Jennifer Palmier, who is now deputy communications director for President Barack Obama, also told the Greensboro court about the time Elizabeth angrily confronted a key donor about his support for the presidential candidate's pregnant mistress in 2007 at a hotel in Iowa.

She said the candidate had called her to
the Davenport, Iowa, hotel room where his wife was arguing 
with campaign finance chairman Fred Baron and his wife about the 
couple's financial help to Rielle Hunter.

Palmieri had become close friends with Elizabeth Edwards, and her husband hoped her presence could help calm the situation.

She said she eventually distanced 
herself from the former candidate after he acknowledged the affair in an
August 2008 television interview because he hadn't been truthful about 
the baby he had with his mistress.

The former aide later began crying 
while discussing her friendship with Elizabeth Edwards who she had grown close to while working with her husband. 

Palmieri was with the Edwards 
family when Elizabeth died in December of 2010 after battling 
cancer.

She broke down in tears describing what Elizabeth said: 'She was concerned that when she died, there would not be a man who 
loved her there,' Palmieri said, though she noted that John Edwards was 
there in the end.

That day in Iowa in October of 2007, 
Palmieri said Baron's wife, Lisa Blue, admitted to Elizabeth Edwards 
that she had flown Hunter to Los Angeles for a shopping trip.

'You've got to hold your friends 
close and your enemies closer,' Palmieri quoted Blue as telling the 
enraged wife. Blue added that Hunter was a 'loose cannon' who could have
exposed the affair to the media, Palmieri said.

At the time, a tabloid was publishing
an article about the affair, and Palmieri said the campaign was 
absorbed with keeping the story from crossing over into the mainstream 
media.

Edwards had told his wife he had a 
brief fling with Hunter, but that he had ended the affair many months 
earlier, according to earlier testimony.

In fact, Edwards had continued the 
affair and Hunter was then pregnant with his child. A close aide to 
Edwards, Andrew Young, had rented the mistress a home a few miles away 
from the Edwards family estate in Chapel Hill.

The candidate had kept the arrangement secret from his wife.

Palmieri said Elizabeth Edwards couldn't comprehend why Baron and Blue would have any contact with Hunter.

'She didn't understand why they were embracing her, spending time with her,' Palmieri said.

Asked what Edwards was doing during the argument, Palmieri said she didn't remember him saying much.

'He was more of a spectator than a participant,' she testified.

How much Edwards knew about the money
spent in the effort to cover up his affair is a critical question at 
his trial. Edwards has pleaded not guilty to six counts for campaign 
finance violations related to about $1 million in secret payments from 
Baron and 101-year-old heiress Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon.

Edwards has denied knowing about the 
money, much of which was used to hide the pregnant mistress as he 
campaigned for the White House.

Baron flew Hunter across the country 
in his private jet, paid for stays in luxury resorts and secured a 
$20,000-a-month rental mansion in California.

Glare of the media: Everyday since the beginning of his trial John Edwards has had his daughter Cate by his side

On Tuesday, campaign speechwriter 
Wendy Button testified that Edwards had later admitted to her he knew 
'all along' that Baron had been supporting his mistress and baby.

The girl was born in February 2008 a 
few weeks after he suspended his presidential campaign after poor 
showings in the early primary states.

That contradicts what Edwards has 
said about his knowledge of the money, most notably in a nationally 
televised network interview in August 2008.

During an initial phone call, she 
said Edwards told her that he had wanted to tell the truth since 
November 2008 but had been hampered by things at home.

'He
acknowledged that Quinn was his daughter and that he'd always known she
was his daughter,' Button testified. 'He said that it was wrong for him
to deny her.'

On Wednesday, Edwards' defense lawyer
Abbe Lowell admitted his client had 'lied quite extensively' in that 
interview, saying he had only a brief sexual relationship with Hunter 
and denying he fathered her baby.

Palmieri said she had advised Edwards
against doing the interview, which came shortly after tabloid reporters
photographed Edwards visiting his mistress and baby at a Beverly Hills 
hotel.

'I said I did not want him doing the 
interview if he was going to lie,' Palmieri recounted. 'Even I didn't 
believe what he was saying.'

But Palmieri said Edwards decided to 
go ahead anyway after his wife pressed him to make a public statement 
denying the baby was his.

Yesterday: Toben testified that he retrieved 
possessions of Rielle Hunter's from a rented house in Chapel Hill that 
included a signed picture of Edwards. The picture was signed: 'I love 
you, John'

Benefactor: Paul and Bunny Mellon seen circa 1987. Bunny is now blind and a recluse

In an attempt to mitigate the damage,
Palmieri said she selected ABC's Nightline as the venue for the 
interview because the news show was going up that night against the 
opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics on rival NBC, which was 
expected to get far bigger ratings.

'If John couldn't do the interview 
and tell the truth, it was a mistake,' Palmieri said. 'I didn't think it
would be great if the whole country watched.'

After the interview, Palmieri said 
she asked a friend of Edwards' to deliver him a message that she didn't 
want him to call her for help any more.

'I believed John was continuing to lie and trying to drag me into it,' Palmieri said.

The government says the money should 
have been reported as political donations because it was meant to keep 
Edwards' image and candidacy intact.

The defense argues the payments were 
from one private third party to another and should not be characterized 
as campaign contributions.

Mellon's money went into the personal
accounts of Young and his wife and was used to help cover Hunter's 
living and medical expenses.

Baron paid for private flights and luxury accommodations as the Youngs and Hunter spent months on the run to keep the media from finding out about Edwards' affair.
