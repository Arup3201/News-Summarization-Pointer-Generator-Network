Ancient warriors were far more adept at making bronze weapons that previously thought, a new analysis of a huge battering ram on a 2,000 year-old warship has found.

Known as the Belgammel Ram, the 20kg artefact was discovered by a group of British divers off the coast of Libya near Tobruk in 1964. 

A British team has now completed the first analysis and 3D scan of the ram - and say it was cast in a single piece using advanced techniques for the time.

Known as the Belgammel Ram, the 20kg artefact was discovered by a group of British divers off the coast of Libya near Tobruk in 1964

The Belgammel Ram was found by a group 
of three British service sports divers off the coast of Libya at the 
mouth of a valley called Waddi Belgammel, near Tobruk.

Using a rubber 
dinghy and rope they dragged it 25 metres to the surface.

It was brought
home to the UK as a souvenir but when the divers discovered that it was
a rare antiquity, the ram was loaned to the Fitzwilliam Museum, 
Cambridge.

Ken Oliver is the only surviving member 
of that group of three and the effective owner.

He decided in 2007 that 
is should be returned to a museum in Libya. With the help of the British
Society for Libyan Studies this was arranged in 2010.

The Libyan uprising of 2011 resulted in 
many battles in the area around the museum, but fortunately the museum 
suffered no damage.

The ram is from a small Greek or Roman warship – a 'tesseraria'. These ships were equipped with massive bronze rams on the bow at the waterline and were used for ramming the side timbers of enemy ships.

At 65cm long, the Belgammel Ram is smaller in size and would have been sited on the upper level on the bow.

This second ram is known as a proembolion, which strengthened the bow and also served to break the oars of an enemy ship. Dr Nic Flemming a visiting fellow of the National Oceanography Centre, co-ordinated a team of specialists from five institutes to analyse the artefact before it was returned to the National Museum in Tripoli in May 2010.

Experts were stunned to find it was made in one piece.

'Casting a large alloy object weighing 
more than 20kg is not easy.

'To find out how it was done we needed 
specialists who could analyse the mix of metals in the alloys; experts 
who could study the internal crystal structure and the distribution of 
gas bubbles; and scholars who could examine the classical literature and
other known examples of bronze castings.

A series of experts analysed the ram.

Dr Chris Hunt and Annita Antoniadou of Queen's University Belfast used radiocarbon dating of burnt wood found inside the ram to date it to between 100 BC to 100 AD.

This date is consistent with the decorative style of the tridents and bird motive on the top of the ram, which were revealed in detail by laser-scanned images taken by archaeologist Dr Jon Adams of the University of Southampton.

The X-ray team produced a 3-D image of the ram's internal structure using a machine capable of generating X-rays of 10 mevs to shine through 15cm of solid bronze.

By rotating the ram on a turntable and making 360 images they created a complete 3-D replica of the ram similar to a medical CT scan.

The revealed it it is possible that during its early 
history the bronze would have been remelted and mixed with other bronze 
on one or more occasions, perhaps when a warship was repaired or maybe 
captured.

Further analysis was carried out by 
geochemists Professor Ian Croudace, Dr Rex Taylor and Dr Richard Pearce 
at the University of Southampton Ocean and Earth Science (based at the 
National Oceanography Centre).

An X-ray image of the ram revealed the 3 fins porosity, allowing researchers to work out how it was made

Micro-drilled samples show that the 
composition of the bronze was 87 per cent copper, 6 per cent tin and 7 
per cent lead.

The concentrations of the different metals vary 
throughout the casting. Scanning Electron.

These results indicate the likelihood 
that the Belgammel Ram was cast in one piece and cooled as a single 
object, the team say.

The thicker parts cooled more slowly than the thin parts so that
the crystal structure and number of bubbles trapped in the metal varies
from place to place.

However, the researchers admit thy still do now know how the ram ended up on the seabed.

'We will never know why the Belgammel 
Ram was on the seabed near Tobruk.

'There may have been a battle in the 
area, a skirmish with pirates. It could be that it was cargo from an 
ancient commercial vessel, about to be sold as salvage.

'The fragments of
wood inside the ram show signs of fire, and we now know that parts of 
the bronze had been heated to a high temperature since it was cast which
caused the crystal structure to change.

'The ship may have caught fire 
and the ram fell into the sea as the flames licked towards it. Some 
things will always remain a mystery.

'But we are pleased that we have 
gleaned so many details from this study that will help future work.'

Their results have been published in the International Journal of Nautical Archaeology.

'Although the Belgammel Ram was probably the first one ever found, other rams have since been found off the coast of Israel and off western Sicily.

'We have built a body of expertise and techniques that will help with future studies of these objects and improve the accuracy of past analysis.'
