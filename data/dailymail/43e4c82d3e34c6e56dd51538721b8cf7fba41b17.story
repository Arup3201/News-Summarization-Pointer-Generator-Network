Ever wondered what you'd look like with Angelina Jolie's lips, the Duchess of Cambridge's nose or Cara Delevingne's brows?

That's the concept photographers Bruno Metra and Laurence Jeanson wanted to explore in their latest project which juxtaposes 'normal' faces with body parts taken from supermodels and celebrities.

Metra explains: 'We started this work after observing the behaviour of people close to us and how they reacted to images.

Transformation: Bruno Metra and Lawrence Jeanson use tears from magazines to create their work

Identity: The duo say that the works are intended to show how much people are influenced by the media

Bizarre: While some subjects are rendered beautiful, others are made strange by the cut out images

'Magazines, cinema and television keep creating and imposing codes that become social references [that dictate] what you must look like, how you must do your make-up, what clothes you should wear, how you should behave and so on.

'We are fascinated by the power of media to influence people's identities.'

To create their wonderfully bizarre photographs, the duo asked people to pose in their studio with eyes, lips and other facial features cut from magazines applied to their faces - an essential part of production, according to Metra.

'We worked directly with material coming from the media and magazines for this series,' he explains.

'We cut into [photographed] faces to tape them onto other faces, creating something strangely beautiful which makes you question your own identity.'

Challenging: The series of photographs makes you reconsider the way you see yourself

For everyone: According to Metra, anyone who wants to can be part of series two of their project

Although the first set of photographs in the series is complete, the duo are currently working on the second set, entitled ID2, and are on the look out for models.

'We don't choose our models,' says Metra. 'Everybody can participate in this experience as far as we are concerned.'
