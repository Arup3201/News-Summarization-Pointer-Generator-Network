Raid: Police have searched the home of Reverend Paul Flowers after he was filmed apparently buying hard drugs

Police have searched the home of disgraced former Co-operative Bank chairman Paul Flowers as they investigate drugs offences.

West
 Yorkshire Police is probing him after he was filmed allegedly buying crystal meth, crack cocaine and ketamine.

The Methodist minister led the bank for three years, which lost £700million while he was apparently taking drugs and setting up sex sessions with rent boys.

In 1981 he was convicted of gross 
indecency after he was caught by police performing a sex act with a 
trucker in a public toilet - but he was forgiven by the church.

He
 also resigned as a Labour councillor in Bradford in 2011 after 
'inappropriate but not illegal adult content' was found on a computer he
 used, the city council said.

Police in Yorkshire have admitted they had raided his home.

'Officers executed a search warrant at an
 address in Great Horton, (Bradford) as part
 of an investigation into alleged drugs offences,'  a spokesman for the force.

Labour leader Ed Miliband is facing growing
 questions over his party's links to the former bank chairman, who has 
also been accused of incompetence.

Co-operative Group chairman Len Wardle has already quit amid the deepening scandal.

Mr Wardle brought forward his plans to retire by six months, acknowledging that he led the board that had appointed Mr Flowers.

Investigation: West Yorkshire Police back at the home of disgraced bank boss Paul Flowers today after more revelations about his life

Tory
 chairman Grant Shapps has now demanded to know when Mr Miliband and 
shadow chancellor Ed Balls were aware that Mr Flowers resigned as a 
councillor in Bradford after adult material was found on his computer.

In
 a letter, Mr Shapps challenged the Labour leader to give details of 
private meetings with Mr Flowers, explain why he had been brought on to 
the party's business advisory group, and return a £50,000 donation to Mr
 Balls' office that he had backed.

'Will you instruct your MPs not to
 accept any more money from the Co-operative Group until the current 
investigation is resolved?' Mr Shapps insisted.

Labour has said Mr 
Flowers was 'neither influential nor important' and the 63-year-old has 
been suspended from the party for bringing it into disrepute.

A 
source said: 'It's true that there was a private meeting with Ed in 
March of this year. There were two informal dinners - three meetings 
that we can find records of in the space of three years.

'This shows that Mr Flowers was neither influential nor important.'

Mr Flowers lives in a modest house in Bradford and shared it with his mother until her death last year aged 85

During
 an appearance before the Commons Treasury committee earlier this month,
 where Mr Flowers stumbled over the basic facts and figures relating to 
the ailing bank, he was pressed on whether he had approved a £50,000 
donation to Mr Balls' from the Co-operative Group in 2011/2012 while a 
member of the board.

Ciaron Dodd said Paul Flowers was debauched and 'showered him with gifts'

'My recollection is that we paid for a 
particular researcher to assist the shadow chancellor in the work that 
he needed to do, and that we believed to be a legitimate and proper use 
of resources,' he replied.

A spokesman for Mr Balls said: 'The Co-op 
Group, not the bank, donated £50,000 to the shadow chancellor's office 
which was declared in the normal way at the time.

'Ed has never 
discussed the donation with Paul Flowers. Ed's been to a few events 
which Rev Flowers has also been at, but he's never had a meeting or 
phone conversation with him.'

Last nigh the humiliation of Paul Flowers worsened when a rent boy claimed the ousted Co-op chief hired him for sex.

Ciaron Dodd, 21, said they met in plush hotel rooms paid for by the struggling bank.

The
 Methodist minister, who was forced to quit his £130,000 role in June, 
showered him with gifts and took him for nights out to the theatre, said
 Mr Dodd.

The explosive allegations came as the Labour Party faced further damaging questions about its links with Flowers.

Pictures
 have emerged of a lavish reception hosted by Ed Miliband and Ed Balls at 10 
Downing Street for Flowers and fellow Co-op grandees while 
Labour was in power.

It also emerged that Labour knew two 
years ago that Flowers had been forced to resign as one of the party’s 
city councillors after gay porn was found on his computer.

But
 it appears the Co-op was not told – allowing him to continue until June
 as its banking chairman, a position from which he helped to approve 
massive donations to Labour and Mr Balls.

Dodd, a £650-a-night escort, has backed up his claim by producing
 damning messages sent by Flowers, 63, from his work email - in 
which he organises drug-fuelled threesomes.

Dodd said: ‘I knew what he did for a living and couldn’t believe how debauched he was. 

‘Every time he saw me he knew he was risking everything – but he just didn’t seem to care.

‘He
 took me to the theatre and gave me presents like chocolate and wine. I 
was old enough to be his grandson but he didn’t seem to think we looked 
like the odd couple.’

Prime Minister David Cameron today joked that a senior Labour MP took 'mind-altering substances' during a night out with a former bank chairman who was filmed allegedly using illegal drugs.

Mr Cameron made the gag at Prime Minister's Questions after former environment minister Michael Meacher claimed inward investment to the United Kingdom was lower than in a number of Third World countries.

The Prime Minister retorted Mr Meacher must have been on a night out with Paul Flowers, a Methodist minister who led the Co-operative Bank for three years, who was filmed allegedly buying and using illegal drugs including crystal meth, crack cocaine and ketamine.

Question: The Prime Minister offended Labour's  Michael Meacher today when he asked about investment and Mr Cameron replied: 'I can only conclude that you too have been on a night out of the town with Reverend Flowers

In a question to Mr Cameron, the MP for Oldham West and Royton said: 'Are you aware that according to the Economist, Britain is now 159th lowest in the world in terms of business investment, just behind Mali, Paraguay and Guatemala.

'Can you tell the House that when, under your esteemed leadership and that of the Chancellor, Britain can expect to catch up with Mali?'

Mr Cameron replied: 'I can only conclude that you too have been on a night out of the town with Reverend Flowers (right) and that mind-altering substances have taken effect.

'The fact is that in the first six months of this year, Britain has received more inward investment than in any other country anywhere in the world.'

The joke angered Mr Meacher, who raised a point of order at the end of Prime Minister's Questions.

Turning to Speaker John Bercow, he said: 'As you would have heard, and as everyone else in the House heard, I raised a perfectly reasonable question, which was based on clear evidence as I indicated.

'Is it parliamentary for the Prime Minister to respond by accusing (me) of sounding as if (I) had been taking mind-altering substances? I want to ask whether it is parliamentary to use such an unjustifiable, rude and offensive phrase?'

Mr Cameron replied: 'I completely respect you and the important question you asked which I tried to answer with the point about inward investment in to Britain.

'I made a light-hearted remark. If it caused any offence, then I will happily withdraw it. I think it is very important that we can have a little bit of light-hearted banter and a sense of humour on all sides.'

Earlier, Mr Cameron said that Chancellor George Osborne is to have talks with financial regulators on a possible inquiry into the troubles of the bank.

Mr Cameron told the House of Commons that there were 'a lot of questions that have to be answered' about the appointment of former bank chairman Mr Flowers.

West Yorkshire Police have searched the home of Mr Flowers, a Methodist minister who led the bank for three years, after he was filmed allegedly buying and using illegal drugs including crystal meth, crack cocaine and ketamine.

Co-operative Group chairman Len Wardle has already quit amid the deepening scandal, which came after the ailing bank had to be bailed out by hedge funds after getting into financial difficulties.

At Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Cameron told MPs: 'The Chancellor will be discussing with the regulators what is the appropriate form of inquiry to get to the bottom of what went wrong here.

'But there are clearly a lot of questions that have to be answered. Why was Rev Flowers judged suitable to be chairman of a bank? Why weren't alarm bells ringing earlier?'
