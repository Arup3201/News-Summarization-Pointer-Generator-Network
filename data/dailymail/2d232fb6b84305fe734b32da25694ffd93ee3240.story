A British man who disappeared on holiday in Laos has been found dead, a friend said today.

John-Paul Conley was swept away by currents while swimming in Don Khone river in the south-east Asian country on Tuesday.

The 35-year-old from Middlesborough was travelling the area during a year out with his partner Kate Downey, 29.

The pair had only been in the country for a few days after visiting China and Cambodia, when tragedy struck

Friends and family raised more than £30,000 to fund helicopters searches and boats in a mission to find  Mr Conley, a docker at Teesside Docks, following his disappearance on Tuesday.

Friend
Patrick Ruddy, who organised online fundraising to pay for the 
searches, wrote on the page: ‘We have had sad news from Laos.

‘Early
on the fourth day of searching, John Paul was found on one of the many 
beaches on the river and recovered by fishing boat.

‘Our brilliant, funny and much-loved friend has gone. Now, John Paul will begin his journey home.’

Ms Downey is taking his body to Bangkok, where she will meet family members, Mr Ruddy said.

‘Kate's good friends Andrew and Phillippa McKeown have also arrived in Laos to support her. She is in very good hands,' he adds.

Mr Ruddy said that there is no knowing how long it will take to bring Mr Conley's back to Britain.
