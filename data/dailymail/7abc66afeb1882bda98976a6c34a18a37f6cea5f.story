Princess Charlene has given her first interview since giving birth last week and has revealed that she was 'overwhelmed with emotion' when the babies were born.

The twins, Princess Gabriella Thérèse Marie and Prince Jacques Honoré Rainier, were born six days ago by caesarean section at the Princess Grace Hospital in Monaco.

A week on, the twins and their mother remain in hospital, with 36-year-old Charlene admitting that there's a possibility that the family won't be able to celebrate their first Christmas at home.
