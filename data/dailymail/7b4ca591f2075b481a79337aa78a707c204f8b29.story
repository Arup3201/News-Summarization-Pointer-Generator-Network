Rickie Lambert is expected to come up against a defender who once cheered him from the stands at Southampton when Liverpool face Bournemouth in the Capital One Cup.

Baily Cargill had a season ticket at St Mary’s and celebrated on the pitch after Lambert helped secure his club promotion to the Premier League with a 4-0 win over Coventry in April 2012.

The 19-year-old, on Southampton’s books between 2006-08, is aiming to inflict misery on his hero at Goldsands Stadium however, in a quarter-final tie that is shaping up to be huge for Brendan Rodgers.

Cargill is yet to feature in the Championship, but has played every minute of Bournemouth’s League Cup run so far and is hoping for the chance to test himself against Lambert and fellow ex-Saint Adam Lallana.

‘When I was a scholar I’d go to every home game and I watched Southampton get promoted to the Premier League. I was on the pitch that day,’ he says. ‘My family are all mad Saints fans too, especially my little brother. They’ll enjoy watching me if I play against the likes of Lambert and Lallana.’

He adds: ‘It’s a big match for them and a big match for us. It’s probably come at a good time because we’re on a good run of form – we haven’t lost in 12 games – and Liverpool obviously aren’t doing as well as they’d like to be doing. Liverpool need the win and we’d obviously like to win too.’

If manager Eddie Howe does select Cargill, it would represent a remarkable personal progression. Little more than a year ago Cargill was facing Braintree during a loan spell at Welling in the Conference.

Rather than stick to Under 21 football, he elected to mature among the gnarled battlegrounds of non-League. ‘Experiencing that side of the game was definitely a massive help in my development,’ he says. ‘It will stand me in good stead for the rest of my career.

‘We played Braintree away in only my second game and they had a striker called Jordan Cox. They played a lot of long balls and in that game I went up for at least 20 headers – that was a tough physical battle. There were a few arms flying about.

‘I’ve come a long way since then and definitely got better as a player. If you had told me when I was playing Braintree away that I’d have a chance of facing Liverpool the following season I’d never have believed you.’

Impressive performances against Exeter, Northampton, and Cardiff – with three clean sheets – preceded a 2-1 victory over West Bromwich Albion in the last round as Victor Anichebe, Brown Ideye and Saido Berahino all failed to score.

That earned Cargill a call-up to Aidy Bothroyd’s England Under 20 side for the match against Canada in November – and he scored a powerful header in the 2-2 draw. Manchester United striker James Wilson featured in that youth international and was selected by Louis Van Gaal to start up front against Liverpool on Sunday.

‘I like seeing other lads my age do well, because it makes you realise as long as you get an opportunity and take it then you should play,’ Cargill says. ‘The gaffer is terrific. The training sessions are always really good and with him being a centre-half he can give me tips. He is really keen on you developing into the best player you can be.'
