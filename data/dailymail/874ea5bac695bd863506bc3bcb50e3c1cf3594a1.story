All proceeds from the fourth one-day international between Pakistan and New Zealand in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday will be donated to those affected by the the Peshawar school massacre, the Pakistan Cricket Board has announced.

The Pakistani Taliban has claimed responsibility for opening fire on the Army Public School in the city on Tuesday, which resulted in the death of at least 130 people, most of them students, and also left scores injured.

'We tried our best to postpone the fourth ODI but were constrained by the broadcasters commitment as well as for cricketing reasons advised by New Zealand management,' said a PCB spokesman.

Pakistan have been playing their 'home' matches in the middle east since the Lahore terrorist attacks of 2009 forced them from their home country.

'We are playing outside Pakistan only because of the threat of terrorism at home,' the spokesman added.

'If we allow terrorists to disrupt our matches abroad, then all will be lost. So we have decided to go ahead with the match and our players will wear black armbands in grief and observe a minute's silence and flags will be lowered.

'The PCB will donate proceeds of the match to the families of the martyred and towards rebuilding the school.'

The PCB has postponed the match between Pakistan A and Kenya which was due to be played on Thursday and the women's Malala Cup final which was due to be played on Wednesday.

'It's sad what's happened in Peshawar,' Pakistan's stand-in skipper Shahid Afridi told the PCB website before the match against New Zealand got under way.

'Our prayers are with the families who have lost their kids. I hope the situation will get better in Pakistan and we live in a secure atmosphere.

'Obviously Pakistan is our country and if any thing happens there it saddens us.

'Whether we are in Pakistan or away, it affects us. Ever since we heard this news we were saying that it should not have happened.

'May Almighty give patience to the parents of these kids who lost their lives, we share their grief and loss.'
