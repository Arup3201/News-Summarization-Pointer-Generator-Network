Just one year ago she was playing the lame boy in her school's production of The Pied Piper of Hamelin.

Now 10-year-old Isabelle Allen from Eastbourne, East Sussex, is being tipped for Hollywood stardom after starring alongside Anne Hathaway, Russell Crowe, Helena Bonham Carter, Hugh Jackman and Sacha Baron Cohen in an upcoming adaptation of the musical Les Miserables.

And Isabelle, who was talent spotted during the school play, has even been chosen as the poster girl for the film, which is expected to be a front-runner for best screenplay at the 2013 Oscars.

Isabelle plays the younger version of Amanda Seyfried's character, Cosette, the illegitimate daughter of Anna Hathatway's character - factory worker-turned-prostitute Fantine.

The schoolgirl was spotted in the Moira House School production of The Pied Piper of Hamelin by Jeremy Taylor from the National Youth Music Theatre.

Mr Taylor was so impressed with her turn as the lame boy that he persuaded talent agents to let her audition for director Tom Hooper's film version of the world's longest running musical.

Parents Elaine and Nigel Allen thought Isabelle might be an extra in the film, but instead she was recommended for the part of Cosette, one of the story's central characters, who is cruelly beaten and abused.

Despite having no professional acting experience, Isabelle ended up beating thousands of children to win the coveted role.

She
said: 'When I found out I’d been picked I was so excited. I was jumping
up and down on my bed. But I was also a little scared and nervous, 
because I didn’t know what to expect.'

Isabelle was quickly expected to stay up shooting scenes as late as 6am, but says that as soon as she got on set the experienced actors quickly went out of their way to make her feel at ease and comfortable.

She said Academy Award-winner Russell Crowe was 'friendly' but also 'focused' and 'serious', while Amanda Seyfried offered words of encouragement and was constantly knitting between takes.

But it was her on-screen father, X-Men star Hugh Jackman, who immediately took her under his wing.

The Australian actor, who has two adopted children, took it upon himself to move rocks away from the set so Isabelle would not step on them, and made sure she was comfortable when not filming.

Isabelle said: 'All the famous people were so nice and really helpful - they made me feel relaxed'

She said: 'He would joke about what my favourite cocktail was and I'd say it was a water cocktail. He was very funny and would talk in these different voices.

'He tried to persuade the director to let me wear shoes while I was filming because it was cold, but we weren't allowed to. He was very kind to me.

'All the famous people were so nice and really helpful. They made me feel relaxed.'

On the back of her film success, Isabelle has landed the same role for the current West End production of Les Miserables.

And the youngster has already received compliments on her performance in the upcoming film from her co-stars, as well as personal emails from Hugh Jackman and Amanda Seyfried.

She will also get the red carpet treatment when she attends the film's World Premiere in Leicester Square on 5 December, and in New York on 10 December.

Offers for new films have already come in, including a Disney role she is not allowed to talk about yet.

But her new-found fame has not stopped her from going to her school lessons and spending time with friends.

Mum Elaine said: 'She’s never changed. She still just the same Izzy. It's been an incredible year and we'll have to wait to see what happens next.'
