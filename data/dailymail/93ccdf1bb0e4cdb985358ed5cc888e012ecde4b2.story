Tamara 
Ecclestone totters past the yachts on her high-heeled Jimmy Choo’s to 
air-kiss Naomi Campbell. The heiress to a £5billion fortune meets the 
supermodel.

In
 the minutes before Sunday's Monaco Grand Prix this thin thread of tarmac
 next to the Med will be the world’s most exclusive catwalk.

A
 horde of photographers will scramble to capture this gaudy parade of 
sashaying stars. Tamara and her husband, Jay Rutland, pop brat Justin 
Bieber, Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch and British singer Pixie Lott
 will be clicked furiously.

Exactly which A-listers hot-foot it over from the Cannes Film Festival to be here is a secret. One who will not be in attendance, however, is Mel Gibson. He asked for a pass, but Tamara’s daddy — Bernie Ecclestone, the sport’s diminutive puppeteer — politely declined.

Bieber, a strangely skinny little chap, was camera-shy. He went in to see Ecclestone in his paddock headquarters. What, one wonders, did the 20-year-old Canadian pop star and the  83-year-old son of a Suffolk trawlerman talk about?

Whatever, Bieber took a ‘selfie’ with Ecclestone before scampering out of the back door and scuttling away in his white beanie and orange shorts without the cadre of photographers spotting him.

party all night: British model Naomi Campbell, here with Flavio Briatore, celebrates her 44th birthday in Monaco

The venue for Campbell’s 44th birthday 
party on Friday was apt —the Billionaire Club, a brassy, swanky joint 
owned by her former boyfriend, the Italian high-roller Flavio Briatore. 
He is the one with his shirt undone to his solar plexus and the swagger 
of a man who has just broken the bank at  Monte Carlo. His boat, Force 
Blue, a floating monument to extravagance, cost him nearly £70million.

That, though, is not the most expensive 
in the harbour. Vijay Mallya, the India drinks mogul and owner of the 
Force India team, has a yacht — the Indian Empress —half as big again. 
He bought it from the Qatari Royal Family for a few million more than 
Briatore spent.

Roman Abramovich’s Eclipse, worth £300m, is not here this year (though many Russians are moving into the area permanently).

Above
 the harbour nestles a range of five-star hotels. The most exclusive is 
the Hotel de Paris on Casino Square. The Churchill Suite there cost 
£90,000 last night. So extensive, and expensive, is the hotel wine 
cellar that during World War II, a brick wall was built around it to 
stop looting.

The other grand hotel is the Hermitage. Caviar, oyster 
sauce, foie gras and a glass of champagne there will set you back £100. 
It is where Ecclestone usually stays. Not this year. He has been invited
 on a boat by Donald Mackenzie, the chairman of CVC, the private equity 
firm that owns Formula One.

The weekend is dotted with glamorous 
social engagements. At Friday’s annual fashion show, Tamara sat next to 
Prince Albert. The Prince last night hosted perhaps the most exclusive 
of all events — the cocktail party in the Grimaldi Palace overlooking 
the harbour. Two hundred or so of the great and the good are invited.

The
 Prince will host the traditional gala dinner tonight. This is still 
black tie. The race winner sits next to the Prince and Princess 
Charlene.

If you look closely at Monte Carlo you can see some frayed 
edges: ugly buildings and facelifts that have fallen flat. As Somerset 
Maugham observed, it can be ‘a sunny place for shady people’.

But, 
still, this is the only venue on the calendar which pays Ecclestone no 
money for the privilege of staging a grand prix. ‘Monaco does more for 
us than we do for it,’ conceded Ecclestone. Who can argue?
