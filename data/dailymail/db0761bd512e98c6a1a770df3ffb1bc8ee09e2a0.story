A skydiver narrowly avoided death after a double parachute malfunction resulted in him plunging to the ground at around 25mph.

The footage captured on the skydiver’s head camera begins with a trio jumping from a plane over Perris, California.

Initially the jump appears to be a success as the skydiver picks up images of the plane, his fellow skydivers dressed in wingsuits and the Californian landscape on his camera.

But suddenly, the bridle, which connects the pilot chute – a small auxiliary parachute used to deploy the main parachute – to the deployment bag containing the parachute, wraps around the pilot chute.

It then appears that the reserve parachute, which is automatically deployed via an RSL (reserve static line) system after cutting away from the main parachute, becomes tangled.

This sends the skydiver spiralling out of control, and he begins a dizzying descent back down to earth from a height of more than 1000ft.

As he finally reaches the ground it appears that he is descending relatively slowly considering he is without a fully working parachute.

But as he slams into the earth with a crunch he groans in pain and shock before attempting to rise to his feet.

The man was later taken to the hospital where, remarkably, he was only treated for mild concussion and bruising.

Writing online after the incident, the skydiver said that he was very lucky to be alive and that some of the people who witnessed the fall expected it to be fatal.
