One Chicago news station experienced technical difficulties on Friday when an audio glitch made all but one news reporter silent, at least verbally.

WGN-Channel 9 was without sound for 19 minutes between 7:03 to 7:22 am. The silence didn't stop news anchors Larry Potash and Robin Baumgarten from holding hand written signs and making jokes, however.

Reporter Nancy Loo was the only newscaster not affected by the loss of sound and explained to viewers that she had the only working microphone, reports Robertfeder.com.

'The computer that controls the audio board locked up and shut down the board,'news director Greg Caputo told Feder.

Larry Potash decided to poke fun at the situation by holding up signs with written messages

Despite the silence, Potash and Baumgarten still had a lot to say.

'Please Help' wrote Larry Potash on a piece of paper.

'I blame Larry,' said Robin Baumgarten with a dry erase board.

'Boss said, Hey Let's get a cheaper audio board. No one will notice,' joked Larry.

'Now's my chance to Dance,' said Baumgarten as she did a little shimmy.

Everybody noticed the silence in the studio

'Still more interesting than channel 7,' said Potash of the Chicago rival.

'Larry has never looked more attractive,' jokes Baumgarten.

Potash then suggested the audio technicians try 'Try Ctrl + Alt + Del'

'Keep talking Nancy,' said Baumgarten who was still trapped in silence.

When the audio was finally back in the studio, 'this tops it all said Baumgarten.'

'We have been silenced. This has never happened to us before,' she continued.

The show called the moment 'The Most Excellent Technical Meltdown in Live Television News History.'
