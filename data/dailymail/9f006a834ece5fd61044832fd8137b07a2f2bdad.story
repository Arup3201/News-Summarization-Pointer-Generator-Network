Usain Bolt has helped Jamaica to win gold in the men's 4x100m relay at the Commonwealth Games.

The world's fastest man ended his controversial stay in Glasgow by powering down the home straight to bring his team home in 37.58 seconds, a Games record. 

England took silver, with quartet of Adam Gemili, Harry Aikines-Aryeetey, Richard Kilty and Danny Talbot holding off Trinidad and Tobago, clocking  a time of 38.02secs.

In characteristic style Bolt danced, posed for selfies and high-fived fans as he took in his lap of honour after the race was over.

The win marks the first Commonwealth gold for Bolt, despite winning fifteen other gold medals in his career at the Beijing and London Olympics, and other world championships.

In another amusing moment he also threw his baton to a marshal just after he crossed the finish line, which the man managed to catch.

The 20-year-old, from Plymouth, triumphed over other international competitors with a score of a staggering 516.55.

It means he has successfully defended his Commonwealth title after scooping two gold medals in Delhi four years ago.

This time around, Daley gave a spectacular performance, securing his win in his fifth dive with a superb back 3.5 somersault.

He was supported by both his mother Debbie and boyfriend Dustin Lance Black, who were pictured holding up an England flag reading 'Daley'.

Earlier today England's Nicola Adams become the first female Commonwealth Games boxing champion two years after winning the inaugural Olympic title.

The 31-year-old beat Northern Ireland's Michaela Walsh in the four-round flyweight contest via a split decision.

'Again I've managed to create history,' Adams said. 'It's on to Rio (2016 Olympics). It's the next step. I've been thinking of this since the London 2012 Olympics.

'To think I've finally got it is unbelievable. It's a massive sigh of relief and now I can relax a bit.'

It was England's 50th gold in Glasgow, where the team is on course to finish top of the medal standings for the first time since 1986 and end Australia's 20-year Commonwealth dominance.

Bolt's win will put to bed comments published in The Times this week in which he allegedly called the Glasgow games 'bulls***' saying that London 2012 was 'better'.
