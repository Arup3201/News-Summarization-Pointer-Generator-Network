North America may be full of bears, but it is rare for people ever to get close enough to observe them in their natural environment.

So this video, filmed by a hidden camera in a Canadian park, is a unique opportunity to see how wildlife behave when they are not in the presence of humans.

And the result may be surprising - because the bears appear to be pole-dancing around a tree in the middle of the woods.

Dance party: A family of bears has been filmed dancing around a tree in a Canadian park

Comfort: The bears were apparently attracted by the chance to scratch their backs on the tree's bark

Pose: The unusual positions taken by the animals are reminiscent of human pole-dancing

The extraordinary video was filmed in Kananaskis Country, a large expanse of national park in the province of Alberta.

Part of it was made with a normal camera, and part with a night-vision lens, so that it captures wildlife at play 24 hours a day.

Over a number of days in May and June this year, a variety of animals including deer and black bears approached the tree which the camera was trained on.

Bounce: Some have compared the bears' antics to the popular dance move twerking

Pioneer: This grizzly was the first bear to discover the therapeutic effects of the tree in Kananaskis Country

Bandwagon: A black bear also joined in the fun by going to scratch its back on the tree

But rangers really hit the jackpot when a family of grizzly bears discovered the tree and adopted it as their latest plaything.

When the first bear arrived, he began scratching his back against the bark.

This apparently produced such a pleasant sensation that he spread the news to other grizzlies, and before long they were all checking out the tree.

Wildlife: This deer was another animal to be caught on the rangers' camera in late May and early June

Night vision: The camera was not only operating in daylight hours but filmed through the night too

At one point, as many as four bears were vying to grab a spot on the tree - and their vigorous motion made it look as though they were pole-dancing.

The video of still images edited together and set to an upbeat soundtrack by Ewan Dobson was uploaded to YouTube by Alberta parks offficials.

It has garnered more than 200,000 views in less than a week as viewers flocked to enjoy the wild antics.
