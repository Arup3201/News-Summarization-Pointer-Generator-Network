Tom Stalker has pulled out of his British title eliminator with Chris Jenkins to instead fight for the WBO European belt.

Former Team GB captain Stalker was due to face Jenkins in Liverpool on October 25 but will now tackle Jack Catterall.

The light-welterweight has won his first nine fights since turning professional.

And he told Sportsmail: 'It's potentially a massive springboard for my career and one that gives me the chance to become one of the top 15 ranked boxers in the world.

'I was originally scheduled to be fighting Chris Jenkins for a British title eliminator and I know he will probably be upset by the disruption this causes to his plans but I believe this could be a more rewarding fight for my career and hopefully he will recognise that.

'Chris would have been training hard and it's still a fight I would like to take should he become British champion. The reality is the fight with him was not a final eliminator and would not guarantee a British title fight even if I had won. I could be waiting around for another six months for the chance.

'At my age, 30, I can't afford to wait and that's why this has to be the right step now.

'I do believe the WBO European can act as a quicker springboard for me to be fighting as a top 10 ranked fighter and it's too good an opportunity to turn down.'
