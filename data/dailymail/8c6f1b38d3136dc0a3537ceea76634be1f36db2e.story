Tracy Leann Bess-Thacker, 29, is charged with theft for allegedly scamming a Utah couple out of $200

An Iowa woman has been arrested after allegedly faking a pregnancy to scam adoptive parents out of money - and it's the second time she has been busted. 

Tracy Leann Bess-Thacker, 29, used a sonogram and other hospital pictures from a previous pregnancy to trick a Utah couple desperate for a baby into sending her $200, according to police.

Authorities say she's up to her old tricks again. In 2011, she was charged with filing a false report and suborning perjury after she used 19 different alias to scam parents from Nebraska, Illinois, Hawaii, Iowa, and Kansas. 

Many of the prospective parents in that case traveled to Iowa to meet Bess-Thacker and gave her $3,000 for food, clothing and baby supplies, according to authorities. 

'Tracy Bess is an internet predator who intentionally inflicts mental anguish and emotional distress on adoptive parents. This is a strong example of an internet bullying case that has not been considered in the law,' Ankeny Police Chief Gary Mikulec told WHO-TV. 

Police say the Utah couple contacted police about Bess-Thacker last July after they discovered stories online about her 2011 arrest.  

At the time, police said there wasn't enough evidence to arrest her. 

Last month, a break in the case came and police took her into custody.  

She is charged with fourth-degree theft. 

Bess-Thacker allegedly created a birth mother registry on for LifeLong Adoptions, which pairs mothers with adoptive parents. She also made posts online and on social media groups where adoptive parents connect with birth mothers, according to police. 

Police say they fear other victims of Bess-Thacker could still be out there. They've asked anyone else who's had contact with her online to call 515-289-5240.
