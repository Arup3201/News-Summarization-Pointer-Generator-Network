Identified: Neighbors identified the most recent gunman as 33-year-old Sonny Archuleta

The second gunman to open fire in Aurora, Colorado in so many months has been identified by neighbors as 33-year-old Sonny Archuleta.

The gunman shot dead three people yesterday at a house near the cinema where another lone shooter gunned down 12 people at a screening of ‘The Dark Knight Rises’ in July.

Archuleta’s MySpace and Twitter pages reveal that he was deeply religious and lost his brother Pat to gun violence only last year.

Police said Archuleta fired shots at officers Saturday from a second-story window before officers killed him. Once inside, they found the bodies of three other adults.

Archuleta, who wasn’t formally named as the suspect by police, held officers at bay for nearly six hours after neighbors reported gunfire at 3 a.m. inside the modest townhome in the Denver suburb of Aurora, said police Sgt. Cassidee Carlson.

It wasn't known if officers shot the suspect or if he shot himself.

A relative told the New York Post that Stacie Phillbrook, her boyfriend, and her stepfather were all killed. Archuleta’s wife, Stephanie, managed to escape the shooting.

Investigators said the two men and one woman appeared to have been killed before officers arrived.

According to Archuleta’s Twitter page, his brother, Patricio, was gunned down near MGM’s Restaurant and Lounge in Denver in September of 2011.

Pat Archuleta, 34, was shot to death that Labor Day weekend. The gunman was identified as 33-year-old Luiz Meza.

Following the shooting, Sonny Archuleta took to Twitter to write: ‘My brother Pat was murdered in Denver, Colorado on Friday September 3 at 1:45am. Pray for my family and that Jehovah well get the glory from this.’

A large front window was missing in the two-story townhome, the window's mini-blinds in disarray. Bullet holes marked two upstairs windows, and neighbors milled about outside.

A fifth person escaped unharmed and called police to report that she saw three people inside the home who 'appeared lifeless,' said Carlson, who declined to elaborate about the woman's escape.

A motive for the killings was unknown, and police had yet to say what weapon or weapons were used. Investigators wearing gloves and carrying evidence bags were going over the crime scene.

Officers evacuated neighbors' homes during the standoff and used a bullhorn to communicate with the gunman, urging him to surrender.

The shootings occurred about four miles southeast of the Aurora Mall, where 12 people were killed and dozens were wounded by a gunman at a midnight showing of 'The Dark Knight Rises' on July 20.

The man charged in that shooting, James Holmes, goes to court Monday for a preliminary hearing in which prosecutors will present their case against him.

The July shootings prompted Gov. John Hickenlooper - just before the Newtown, Conn., massacre - to say it is time to debate gun control. It's expected to be a heated topic at the Colorado Legislature this year.

Aurora, just east of Denver, is one of Colorado's largest and most diverse cities with more than 335,000 residents. It is home to Buckley Air Force Base as well as the sprawling University of Colorado Health Sciences Center campus, where James Holmes studied neuroscience before the movie theater shootings.
