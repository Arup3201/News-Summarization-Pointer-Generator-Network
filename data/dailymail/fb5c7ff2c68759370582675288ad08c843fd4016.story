The Grand Canyon, one of the seven wonders of the natural world, is facing the most serious threats to its existence since it became a US park 95 years ago as nascent developments jostle over its dwindling water supplies.

The menace is two-fold, say National Park Service officials, and both would alter the park's vistas and jeopardize its fragile ecology and water supply. The most immediate comes from the east on the floor of the canyon, where few visitors ever venture.

The Navajo Indian tribe wants to change that by making the area more accessible to tourists. The group has proposed a Grand Canyon Escalade gondola to ferry people from planned hotels and restaurants on its reservation abutting the park along the Little Colorado River to the point where it intersects with the Colorado River.

The Colorado River, seen here winding through the canyon from Navajo Point, is said to be at risk from the planned developments. A proposed gondola ride would ferry tourists from the Navajo Reservation to the east to this area to give tourists rare access to the canyon floor

The Native Americans contend that they have rights to the property above the high-water mark of both rivers, The Los Angeles Times reports. The National Park Service says that the proposal would disrupt the natural beauty of the canyon and creep in on its boundaries.

The other threat comes from the south, where a tiny two-block town recently approved a major housing and commercial development that would put significant pressure on the ecology and water supply of the arid South Rim plateau. Tusayan, population 555, wants to build 2,200 houses and 3 million square feet of commercial space.

They are serious threats to the future of the park,' park Superintendent. Dave Uberuaga told The Times. 'When you have that size and scope of potential development that close to the park, it will impact our visitor experience.'

The Grand Canyon, carved out over the eons by rushing river water, began to form 17 million years ago, making it nearly three times older than previously thought, scientists said in 2008. The canyon is 277 miles long, 18 miles wide and represents two billion years of the Earth's geological history.

Garcia Lopez de Cardenas of Spain was the first European known to have visited the canyon in 1540, and it became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979.

More than five million tourists visit the Grand Canyon every year, making it one of the most popular destinations in the US. Most of them go only so far as the South Rim to take in - and digitally chronicle - the seemingly endless expanse of receding canyons and rock walls that descend down to the Colorado River a mile below.

Only the most tenacious and experienced of hikers ever take the long, meandering path to the canyon floor.

Park managers have struggled to preserve the South Rim natural vista for years, but the developments are testing their limits in their push to give tourists easier access to the rivers and make a bundle of cash in the process.

The Native American tribes around the park have already in recent years been pursuing developments to cash in on more of the canyon's tourism dollars. Grand Canyon West, on land owned by the Hualapai tribe, runs the Skyway attraction, a glass walkway that juts out past the cliff walls.

Since 2007, it has also given helicopter tours that land on tribal property next to the river.

The Navajo's planned gondola would give more visitors that rare opportunity to see the canyon floor, developer R. Lamar Whitmer, who is working with the tribe, told The Times.

The park service offers nothing more than 'a drive-by wilderness experience', Whitmer said. 'The average person can't ride a mule to the bottom of the canyon. We want them to feel the canyon from the bottom.'

But park officials say the Navajo's claims to the land by the river are mistaken. They say the federal government owns all the land a quarter-mile on either side of the Colorado, and development isn't allowed within that area.

The Navajo still must officially approve the plan, and some within the tribe oppose it for spiritual reasons. They believe the two rivers represent male and female, and life begins at their confluence.

The bigger threat is the development planned two miles from the canyon's front entrance because of how it would diminish the small amount of water found naturally on the plateau.

The town of Tusayan has approved a plan that would increase its demand for water fourfold, The Times reported, without detailing where it would all come from.

Arizona is currently suffering its worst drought in at least 110 years, leaving not enough water to support both wildlife and a new development.

'That kind of water just isn't around there,' Uberuaga said. Yet the city continues 'to pursue a full buildout and full development at whatever pace the developer wants.'

Tusayan developer Tom De Paolo and partners in Stilo Development Group, backed by Italian investors, have been trying to build at the Grand Canyon since 1991, when they began systematically acquiring private land within nearby Kaibab National Forest, according to The Times.

The town has the right to extract water from the plateau's aquifer, and its wells have drained water resources by 10 per cent in recent years.

The park service is urging Tusayan to downsize its plans.

As they stand, the developments represent 'profound and enormous threats to the park', said Dave Nimkin of the National Parks Conservation Association. 'It's a grim forecast.'
