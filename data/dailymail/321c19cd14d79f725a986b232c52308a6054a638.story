A NASCAR driver was forced to withdraw from a Sprint Cup series race this weekend after his car was stolen early Friday morning from a hotel parking lot.

Travis Kvapil was supposed to drive the $250,000 Chevrolet race car for the small-budget Team XTREME but had to drop out of the race after missing a mandatory inspection.

The No. 44 car was inside a trailer hitched to a black 2004 Ford pickup truck parked outside the team's hotel in Morrow, Georgia. 

The truck and trailer were driven out of the parking lot around 5:30am, just 15 minutes before the team was scheduled to leave for the Atlanta Motor Speedway, according to police.

A crewman had been outside smoking a cigarette just a few minutes before the theft. 

In addition to the race car, the trailer also contained a spare engine valued at $100,000 and racing equipment valued at $17,500, according to a police report. 

Team Xtreme Racing owner John Cohen estimated the total value to be somewhere between $350,000 and $400,000.

Kvapil said he was crushed that he now wouldn't have the opportunity to race in what would have been his first track appearance of 2015, calling it a 'big setback'. 

'You can handle maybe getting a flat tire, or getting caught up in a wreck, or a blown engine, something that actually happens on the race track,' he said. 

'Or you don't qualify, because you don't have enough speed. But to not even get a chance ... that's pretty disheartening.'

The theft hit the small Team Xtreme Racing even harder, especially after they had wrecked a car in a Daytona 500 qualifying race just last week. 

Not only did the team have to work overtime to get a new car prepared for this weekend's race, the stolen car was Cohen's favorite.

'I just feel bad for my guys, they were really proud of this car,' he told ESPN. 

'I called that car Old Faithful, because you could run that car anywhere and it would do good.'

The car was inside a trailer hitched to a black 2004 Ford pickup truck (pictured) parked outside the team's hotel in Morrow, Georgia. The team's owner estimated it was carrying almost $400,000 worth of equipment

Kvapil tweeted about the theft, asking his followers to 'let me know' if they saw his car around. He also wrote: 'I bet when whoever has it, opens the trailer and is going to be like 'oh snap'

The white trailer had no markings and Kvapil believes the person who stole it probably had no idea what they were really nabbing, he told ESPN. 

'There's a lot of money inside that little trailer right now,' he said. 'For the team's sake and John Cohen's sake, hopefully the parts and pieces can be recovered or it will be a really huge setback.'

He also wrote: 'I bet when whoever has it, opens the trailer and is going to be like 'oh snap''. 

Kvapil doubts the thieves would be able to make any money off of the car.

'There's really no use for it out in the general public. I don't really know what you can do with it.' 

'I hope they realize that and will leave it somewhere where police can find it.'  

But even more than just the money, Kvapil told ESPN missing the race will hurt the team as the Sprint Cup series is determined by points per race.

'The beginning of the year, it's so important to establish yourself in the points, and they did a good job with a decent finish last week,' he said. 

'Missing this race will be a big setback for this little team.'
