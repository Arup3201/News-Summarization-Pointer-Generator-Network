Another week, another bizarre dating trend.

We've had silent speed-dating and dating in the dark but the latest activity for singles in London is possible the quirkiest yet.

It involves participants placing a paper bag over their head, and has been dubbed, 'The thinking person's Tinder,' because decisions are fast but based on personality (and body) alone.

Got a pimple? It doesn't matter with this new type of dating, where participants are required to place a paper bag over their head

Bags of fun: The quirky craze of 'speed-dating with a paper bag over your head' has just been launched in London at the British Science Museum

Quirky: Each participant wrote an amusing comment or personal fact on their bag to act as a conversation starter

The event has just debuted at the British Science Museum and, according to organisers, it's bags of fun.

The trend was the brainchild of the 
London-based 'cupids' at Loveflutter.com who have also created a 
smartphone app with the ethos #SayNoToShallow.

'It was a really good laugh,' said Jacques, 24, a Londoner who attended the event.

'It wasn't as materialistic as normal speed dating and you actually do get to know their personalities.'

Success: Hopeful singletons take part in speed-dating with bags over their heads at the British Science Museum

Each participant wrote an amusing comment or personal fact on their bag to act as a conversation starter.

Examples included 'I have three kidneys' and 'Secretly, I want to be a hand model.'

Said Londoner Ian Maddison, 31: 'It was an interesting balance to Tinder and Grindr, but also quite difficult as it's hard to get to know someone in two minutes.

'Your first impression does include how people look and that was denied.'

The face-free hookup party will also be held in New York City this autumn.
