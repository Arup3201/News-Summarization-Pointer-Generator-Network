A state owned TV channel in Romania has sparked outrage after broadcasting songs by a choir who sang anti-Semitic 'Christmas carols' which celebrate the burning of Jews.

TVR3, which is ran by the Romanian government, broadcast the performance by a folk group from Cluj last week.

As part of their set, they sang a carol which glorified the Holocaust and called for Jewish people to be burned in the chimney.

Generations: Both old and young Romanians are part of the choir who sing the anti-Semitic lyrics

According to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, the broadcast aired on December 5 and reached many rural parts of the Eastern European country.

The song rhymes and uses the word 'jidovi', a word Romanians use to describe Jews, and contains the lyrics 'only in the chimney as smoke, this is what the 'jidov' is good for', according to spiegel.de.

Romania's Foreign Minister Titus Corlatean has publicly criticised the broadcast and has even called on prosecutors to take action against the channel.

The Israeli embassy too has responded, saying they were 'concerned' about the show.

In a statement, TVR said they were not responsible for the songs performed by the choir, insisting a selection was chosen by a local culture committee. Â 

A YouTube video of the performance shows the choir singing the offensive song before taking questions from a female host.

She thanks the singers before asking about their choice of music and why it reflects the traditional Cluj culture in Romania.

Anti-Semitism groups in Romania have condemned the broadcast saying it is unacceptable for the channel to evade responsibility by blaming a local organization.

Backlash: TVR3 have been roundly criticized for allowing the song, which promotes the 'burning' of Jews, to be broadcast on state-run TV. Bosses at the station have since been sacked pending an investigation

According to the Jewish Telegraph Agency, a complaint has been sent to Romanian President Traian Basescu and Prime Minister Victor Ponta which reads: 'It is outrageous that members of the public weren't scandalized by an anti-Semitic song calling for people to burn Jews.'

Bosses at TVR are already in the process of being replaced after previous unacceptable conduct. It's head Claudiu Saftoiu and the rest of the management have been removed from their posts.
