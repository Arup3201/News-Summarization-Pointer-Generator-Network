Four conmen who swindled £600,000 from the life savings of vulnerable and elderly people they built relationships with after approaching them on their doorsteps have been jailed for their ‘heartless’ crimes.

The men, who had worked together for various building companies over the years, conspired to trick their victims into paying for expensive building works they did not need at ‘inflated prices’, Chester Crown Court was told.

The scale of one the frauds, in which they tricked a victim into letting one of the gang buy his house for around £40,000 less than it was worth, was described as ‘breathtaking’ by Judge Nicholas Woodward, who said it was like something ‘glamorised by Hollywood films’.

Mark Dodd, 50, Neil Jones, 38, Kevin Sweeney, 37, and Paul Williams, 50, were jailed for ‘fleecing’ four vulnerable victims out of their life savings by gaining their trust and betraying them in the most cynical way, the court was told.

Beatrice Price, a frail 80-year old when she was targeted, entrusted the defendant Jones with her finances after he tricked his way into her trust, only to have her accounts siphoned of almost £50,000 of savings.

Williams, 50, forged 83-year-old Winifred Owen’s signature in order to write a cheque to his daughter for £14,750 after tricking his way into her home on a bogus visit to check her windows. He also did the same to Mrs Price on a separate occasion.

Another victim - retired GP Dr Peter Grant - was tricked into dropping the price of his sister’s bungalow and their former family home, which he was selling for her because she had learning difficulties.

The property was subsequently bought by Sweeney for a fraction of its true value.

Judge Woodward sentenced Dodd to five years, Sweeney to four-and-a-half years, Jones to four years and Williams to 18 months in jail.

Andrew Thomas, prosecuting, told the court: ‘The defendants fall to be sentenced for their part in an overlapping series of frauds and thefts with a total value in excess of £600,000.

‘Their victims were private householders who were canvassed by them in relation to dubious building works. In each case, the defendants built a relationship of trust with the victim before using it either to commit fraud or theft.’

Dodd, from Liverpool, pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to defraud but was found guilty by a Chester jury on October 1.

The court heard Dodd is involved in the conspiracy in respect of building works for Dr Grant with a total value of £445,000.

Salesman Neil Jones from Wirral, tried to pass himself off as a financial adviser.

He admitted conspiracy to defraud Beatrice Price in respect of building works to the value £49,535.

He has also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud Dr Grant in respect of building works to the value of £445,000 and conspiracy to defraud Dr Grant over the sale of the bungalow to the tune of £40,000. The total value of his fraud amounts to more than £534,535, Mr Thomas said.

Justice: The conmen were handed jail sentences at Chester Crown Court

Paul Williams, 50, from Tranmere, worked for the other defendants as a self-employed salesman, apparently selling door-to-door, the court heard.

Williams pleaded guilty to two offences: theft of £7,840 from Beatrice Price and theft of £14,750 from Winifred Owen.

Married couple Kevin and Nicola Sweeney, 37 and 38 respectively, now live at the property formally owned by their victim Dr Grant.

Fitter Kevin Sweeney, previously from Huyton, Liverpool, pleaded guilty to the same charges as Neil Jones.

Local government worker Nicola Sweeney pleaded guilty to transferring the proceeds of the fraud committed on Dr Grant, worth around £57,000.

Judge Woodward sentenced her to ten months in jail, suspended for two years.

Judge Woodward branded the defendants ‘conmen’ who took advantage of others who were rendered vulnerable, ‘whether by old age or simple naivety’.

'This con was reminiscent of the type of activity that is sometimes glamorised in Hollywood films,' said Judge Woodward.

He said their crimes were ‘calculated, deliberate and sophisticated’, adding: ‘You were ruthless in extracting every single penny you could.’

He said the gang carried on fleecing the victims ‘despite the fact you realised you were cheating people out of their accumulated life savings’.

Judge Woodward added: ‘These were truly heartless offences and they left your victims both emotionally and financially bereft.’

Addressing the specific fraud on Dr Grant, in which the gang ‘played different characters’ in a bid to get him to lower the price of the house he was selling for his sister, Judge Woodward said: ‘Dr Peter Grant is a very decent man who has spent his life working for the community and helping to care for his disadvantaged sister who is the other victim of this charge.

‘The scale of the fraud on those people is simply breathtaking. This con was reminiscent of the type of activity that is sometimes glamorised in Hollywood films.

‘Each of you entered into the scene at different times playing different characters, all of whom appeared to be independent. The reality was, this was a cynical scheme to divest your victims of their life savings.’

He added: ‘This was the unscrupulous targeting of vulnerable victims in an organised and planned way over a long period.’

Dr Peter Grant’s sister, Carol Goldstone, suffers from a learning disability and now lives in supported accommodation, the court heard. Both are in their 60s. The gang carried out unnecessary work not only on the Chester bungalow but also on Dr Grant’s own home in Liverpool.

‘The total loss in respect of the building fraud on Dr Grant is about £445,000,’ Mr Thomas said.
