Manchester United are facing a nightmare repeat of the saga that saw Paul Pogba reject a new deal at the club and go on to join Juventus.

This time, it is 19-year-old attacking midfielder Andreas Pereira who looks set to leave Old Trafford in the summer after rejecting a new contract offered by United.

And, to rub salt in the wounds, Pereira revealed that Pogba himself is urging the youngster to follow his move and join Juve.

Pereira looks ready to leave United once his contract expires at the end of the season after three-and-a-half years at the club.

Pereira is a reported target of Paris Saint- Germain although the Belgium-born player has not ruled out following in the footsteps of Pogba, who left Old Trafford in the summer of 2012 to join the Turin club as a free agent.

'Everyone knows that Juve are a great club,' Pereira told Turin-based sports newspaper Tuttosport. 'I have spoken with Pogba many times, he is a good friend and he told me that I would be well served in moving to Turin, both personally and professionally, two important things for me.

'At this time I'm tied to United. My agent is evaluating the offers that have arrived, including that of Juventus, but it's no secret. Just as it's no secret that I have turned down the offers made by my current club.

'I know the Italian league and I certainly would not be disappointed to play there as it is one of the best leagues. But I have not taken a decision yet.

'Alongside my entourage, I will evaluate all the offers that we have received and will evaluate many things before taking a decision. The financial aspect will be important but not crucial in making my decision.'

Born in Belgium, Pereira has represented Brazil at Under 20 level and plays regularly for the United Under 21 side but has struggled to break into the first team at Old Trafford. 

Pereira made his debut for Louis van Gaal's team as a substitute in their 4-0 Capital One Cup defeat by MK Dons last August.

Pogba was the subject of a bitter wrangle between United and Le Havre when he was lured to Old Trafford as a highly-promising teenager in 2009.

He was tipped to have a big future at United but left for Juventus having made just seven substitute appearances for the Red Devils.

Sir Alex Ferguson tried to tie Pogba down with the offer of a new contract but the Frenchman rejected that after limited first-team opportunities.

He soon became a permanent fixture in Juve's midfield and helped the Old Lady claim Italian title triumphs in 2013 and 2014. Pogba is also firmly established in France's midfield and is one of the hottest properties in world football. 

On Tuesday night the 21-year-old star helped Juventus claim a 2-1 lead over Borussia Dortmund in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie.
