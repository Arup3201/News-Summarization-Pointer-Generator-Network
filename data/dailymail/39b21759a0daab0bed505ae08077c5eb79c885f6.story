Tragedy: Geraldine Jones, 51, had just beaten breast cancer when she died after falling off a horse at a beach in South Wales

It was her dream to ride a galloping horse along a beach with the wind in her hair.

Breast cancer sufferer Geraldine Jones promised herself she would achieve her goal if she survived the disease – and finally got her chance when she was given the all-clear after four years.

But the 51-year-old’s longed-for moment turned into bitter tragedy when she was thrown off her horse and died.

Her friend – an experienced rider – and a passing jogger administered first aid and  a coastguard rescue team was sent to the scene.

But despite their efforts, Mrs Jones was pronounced dead in an air ambulance.

While undergoing treatment for cancer, the mother-of-two is thought to have written a list of things she wanted to do when she beat the illness – a twist on the ‘bucket lists’ prepared by those with a terminal condition.

After learning that she was free of cancer, Mrs Jones started her bid to tick off all the items on her list.

She began by going on holiday to Gower in south Wales last Sunday to visit a friend and ride horses together along the picturesque Llangennith Beach.

Another friend said: ‘Riding on the sand was something Geraldine was really looking forward to. We’ve been told there was a huge smile on her face as she walked down to the beach.’

Mrs Jones’s husband Tim, 53 – with whom she had two sons, Olly, 16, and 12-year-old Henry – was too distraught to speak yesterday at home in Fownhope, Herefordshire.

A neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘He has been inconsolable ever since. She had faced this cancer battle and they had overcome it together … And then this goes and happens. I don’t think I’ve ever heard anything more tragic in my life.

‘She has always wanted to ride a horse on the beach … It was part of her bucket list … Our hearts just go out to her husband and two young boys.’ 

Accident: Mrs Jones was fulfilling her dream of riding down a beach on horseback when she was thrown off, suffering fatal injuries

Scene: The incident took place at Llangennith Beach on the Gower Peninsula, South Wales, last Sunday

Fighter: Mrs Jones, is survived by her husband, Tim, and her two sons Oliver and Henry

The neighbour added: ‘Her experience of cancer, the uncertainty at the time and the news that treatment had been successful, created a heightened appreciation of the smallest things and a greater determination in her that she would live life to the full, be a successful businesswoman and spend quality time with her family.’

Mrs Jones, who had been the head of marketing and communications at St Michael’s Hospice near Hereford, was first diagnosed with cancer in 2010.

She ended her seven years at the hospice to become a freelance communications consultant 12 months ago.

Hospice staff were said to be in tears after the news of her sudden death was announced. Chief executive Nicky West said: ‘Geraldine was a much-loved member of staff at St Michael’s Hospice and her former colleagues have been devastated by the news.

‘Geraldine’s vibrant personality and zest for life made an enormous contribution to St Michael’s. Her exceptional writing skills and empathy for patients and families helped create thought-provoking articles about our work here.

‘Geraldine’s love of life brought joy to the people she spent time with. Her sudden death is a shock, leaving friends and former colleagues saddened and in tears.’

Mrs Jones, who was wearing a helmet at the time of the accident, was an experienced rider but had never galloped on sand before.

Swansea coroner’s office said it would not make a decision on whether to open an inquest until the results of a post-mortem examination were known.

Steve Jones, Swansea coastguard’s manager, added: ‘[The riders] were not doing anything wrong. They were just enjoying the day, as everyone was.’
