'Pathological liar': A coroner said he believed Terry Webb started the fire deliberately so he could rescue his partner's daughters and emerge a hero

A coroner has agreed with a police theory that a 'pathological liar' deliberately started a fire that killed his partner's two year old daughter so he could rescue her and be hailed a hero.

Isobel Dobson was eating her dinner in an adapted Ford Transit minibus with her half-sister Sarah, one, when a blaze broke out in an adjacent barn, spreading to the van and engulfing it in huge flames.

Terry Webb, 39, the partner of Isobel's mother Stacey Catch, 24, managed to pull Sarah from the burning van but couldn't reach little Isobel - known as Izzy - who perished in the blaze West Yorkshire in September 2011.

Mr Webb denied he was responsible for Izzy's death at an inquest at Wakefield Coroners Court today.

But the hearing was told police suspected the 39-year-old - who had previously lied about being an army veteran and invented a story about having a sister who had been brutally murdered - had started the fire himself so that he could rescue the little girls and be feted as a hero and 'the saviour of the day'.

Coroner David Hinchliff, who described Mr Webb as a 'very sad man' who 'wanted to be liked', said: 'I personally have no reason to think that the police's theory is in any way far fetched or unjustified.

'I think the theory is correct.'

Asked by Mr Hinchliff whether he denied the theory offered by police that he had deliberately started the inferno, Webb replied: 'It wasn't me.'

The coroner recorded a narrative verdict, and said: 'The police inquiries were such that they had a reason to be concerned about the activities and possible motive of Stacey's then partner Terry Webb.

Tragic: Isobel Dobson, two, died when the fire spread from a barn to the minibus in which she was eating dinner with her half sister Sarah

Fatal: All experts who reviewed the fire agreed it was started by a naked flame applied to hay in the barn in West Yorkshire, the inquest heard

'It has been apparent that throughout his life that gentleman has perpetrated the most horrendous stories and lies about his previous life - that his own sister was brutally murdered. He invented a total false and spurious military record saying he had served in terrible spots around the world and had suffered psychological damage because of it.

'It was entirely ficticious. He hadn't suffered in any way.

'It was absolute nonsense,' the coroner said.

'It caused the police, not unreasonably in my opinion, a concern that possibly because of this man's flawed personality that he would want to invent stories which would turn him from what was really a very sad man into somebody else. He wanted to be liked. He wanted to be respected and he wanted to be a hero.

'The police theory and I put it no stronger than that, that he might well, in his rather odd psyche, decide to cause a fire to occur, not because he wanted to cause harm to these little girls, but he wanted to rescue them. [Then] he would be regarded as a hero, and the saviour of the day.'

Mr Hinchliff said he believed the theory put forward by police to be correct.

Aftermath: Mr Webb pulled one year old Sarah from the flames engulfing the mini-bus, but was unable to reach Izzy, who died in the blaze at the farm near Pontefract

Mr Webb, wearing a blue, red and white England rugby top with jeans, spoke quietly as he admitted making up a previous career in the army and lying about his non-existent sister being brutally murdered.

Mr Hinchliff, who called him a 'pathological liar', said: 'You have told the most serious of lies. I don't just mean silly tall tales.

'You have made the most horrendous claims about losing your sister and about the military service.

'Can you think what made you say that?' he asked. To which Webb replied simply: 'No.'

Questioned about making up his military career, Webb admitted that he had been in the Cadets when he was younger but failed a medical test when he signed up.

'Mr Webb was a very sad ordinary man who... wanted to ingratiate himself on people by feeding this spurious nonsense'

Coroner David Hinchliff

The coroner pointed out that he not only lied about this to Ms Catch and her family, but also to ambulance staff and police who attended the scene after the horrific fire.

When pressed for a reason why, Webb said: 'To get people to think I was a nice guy.'

'You clearly want to be known as this heroic person, you think that will make people respect you,' Mr Hinchliff said.Mr Hinchliff asked him: "Can you... understand why the police have considered that you were in the vicinity at the time of the fire, you would have had the means of starting the fire as there were firelighters and 2 Stroke [a flammable liquid] in the back of your van.'Mr Webb said: 'I can understand that.'

Mr Hinchliff said: 'The only other person in the vicinity was [witness and passerby] Wendy Russell, she would have no reason. Do you refute the suggestion that you started the fire so that you could rescue the two girls and be seen as a hero?'

Webb replied: 'Yes.'

When Mr Hinchliff asked him to offer an alternative explanation for what happened, Mr Webb said: 'I don't know.'

Coroner Hinchliff also heard from Det Supt Singh, the Chief Investigating Officer in the case, who confirmed that the police had a theory that Webb had started the fire to feed his hero complex.He also said how, through witness statements and a reconstruction, the police estimated there was a time space of approximately four minutes where the fire could have been started.

Discussing the lies that Webb told about his previous career, Mr Singh called it 'complete fabrication', and Mr Hinchliff agreed it was 'absolute nonsense'.

Coroner Hinchliff said: 'I have to be very frank but it occurs to me that Mr Webb was a very sad ordinary man who had risen no higher than a bus driver on the Isle of Wight and wanted to ingratiate himself on people by feeding this spurious nonsense, which he carried through to the very end when he was sitting in an ambulance with all this tragedy around him.'

'Horrific fire': Isobel's mother Stacey Catch, left, said the outcome of the inquest 'hasn't given me any answers', and said she just 'wants to know the truth' about the fire at the farm near Pontefract (right)

'That's true,' Mr Singh agreed, adding that there was 'ample evidence' of Mr Webb's 'dishonesty'.

But Mr Singh said although Mr Webb had been arrested police had been advised by the CPS in March that they should not proceed as there wasn't a reasonable prospect of a conviction on the evidence.

The court also heard from Dr Robert Lewis, who investigated the fire, and found that evidence from witnesses about black smoke which turned to flames could have indicated that a flammable liquid was used as well as a naked flame.

'I just want to know the truth'

Isobel Dobson's mother Stacey Catch

But all experts who reviewed the fire agreed that the fire was started by a naked flame applied to the hay.

The coroner recorded that the cause of Isobel's death was the effects of smoke and fire.

Speaking after the inquest, the little girl's mother said and she and her family believed the police theory and called for justice.

'It hasn't given me any answers,' she said, 'We don't know any more than we did. I just want to know the truth.

'I would like it to go before a jury so that they can decide if he is guilty of murder. Hopefully he will slip up or say something to incriminate himself.

'Me and the whole family believe the police's theory, that he started the fire so he could rescue the girls and look like a hero.'

Senior Investigating Officer Det Supt Singh said after the hearing: 'We note the findings of the coroner today. It is a matter of record that a then 37-year-old man from the local area was arrested in connection with the enquiry. A file was presented to the CPS and it was decided that no further action should be taken.

'This remains an ongoing investigation and we continue to appeal for information from the local community. I continue to urge anyone who has information regarding this case to contact the Homicide and Major Enquiry Team on 101 or CrimeStoppers, which they can do anonymously, on 0800 555 111.'
