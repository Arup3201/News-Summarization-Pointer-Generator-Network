Forget cleavage — the sexiest way to dress is to show off your shoulders.

As actresses Sandra Bullock, Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn showed at this year’s Oscars, a shoulder-less frock is a glamorous look any woman can pull off, whatever her age.

Unlike our busts, arms, bottoms, stomachs — in fact, almost any other area you can think of — shoulders are the one body part that doesn’t sag or wrinkle with age. And dress size isn’t a barrier to the trend.

The Mail’s Fashion Editor ELIZA SCARBOROUGH reveals how to show off your shoulders, whatever your shape or size.

 says: With a straight-up-and-down figure, choosing a dress should be 
about creating curves. An off-the-shoulder style with strap-like sleeves
 that sit in line with your bust makes you wider above the waist. A 
pencil skirt and thicker fabric will create a curvier silhouette. Go for
 different shades on the top and bottom and look for interesting belts. 
This dress has an inverted  V-section, which gives more of a sense of 
hips and a waist than a straight belt would.
