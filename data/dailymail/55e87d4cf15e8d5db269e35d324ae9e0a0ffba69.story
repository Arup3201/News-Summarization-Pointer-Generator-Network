It is a tradition in high schools across the world.

The picture you choose for your yearbook is one which will live with you forever.

And for a group of students in South Korea, they have ensured that in years to come, they will be able to look back with a smile on their faces.

A new craze is sweeping the country, as school leavers go wild competing for the most bizarre final pose.

The phenomenon is not limited to just one school, with pictures from high schools across the country doing the rounds on the internet, Oddity Central reported.

In shots from Jeonju Haesung High School, students are seen posing in costumes to depict their chosen future careers.

A driver, a farmer, a fisherman, an archer and a barber are all among the class of 2013.

The more whacky photos show one student dressed as Ironman, another as The Joker, and a male pupil dressed as a nun.

And another student appears to be aspiring to become a Playboy bunny, while his classmate is dressed as the game character Super Mario jumping high in the air.
