A unique movie film of the 1924 World Series triumph of the Washington Senators over the New York Yankees has just been released by the Library of Congress. 

The 90-year-old film lay undiscovered in the rafters of the garage of a home in Worcester, Massachusetts until an elderly woman died.

The four-minute long video was recorded on highly flammable nitrate film stock and stored in cans in the elderly woman's house. 

The unique footage was captured on highly flammable nitrate stock film which can spontaneously combust

The executor of the woman's estate was the mother of Lynanne Schweighofer, who is a Moving Image Preservation Specialist at the Library of Congress' Packard Campus. 

According to Mike Mashon of the Library of Congress: 'While preparing the neighbor’s house for sale, Lynanne’s father found eight cans of film in the rafters of the detached and not climate-controlled garage, a space we archivists would not normally recommend for long term storage of motion picture film…especially since these reels were labeled as nitrate film stock.

'Now, nitrate film is flammable, creates its own oxygen when it burns, and we have 124 individual vaults at the Packard Campus, each at 39° F / 30% RH, to store the nearly 140 million feet of nitrate we have in our collection. 

'Once it starts to deteriorate, the degradation proceeds rather rapidly and given the temperature fluctuations to which these reels had been subjected for years, we weren’t optimistic about their condition.'

Experts believe the amazing footage was left in the garage and forgotten 

He wrote on his blog: 'So, we contacted Liz Coffey at the Harvard Film Archive, who retrieved the reels on our behalf. She confirmed the film as nitrate and arranged with a certified hazmat shipper at the HFA to send the batch to Culpeper. 

'They were in astonishingly good shape; only a couple evidenced any sign of slight mold or mildew. Many of the reels were printed on Bay State nitrate stock. Bay State was a Kodak competitor back in the day and its nitrate film has proven notoriously unstable, but miraculously not in this instance. The oldest film was from 1919 and the newest from 1926. 

'The house had been sold a couple of times over the years; we expect the first owners placed the film in the garage, although we have no idea why. It seems very likely no one knew they existed until their discovery a few months ago.'

Experts made a digital copy of the film while the original nitrate film stock was photochemically preserved on safety film stock. 

A period appropriate musical score was even added to increase the atmosphere.

The house changed owners several times over the past 90 years but no one had spotted the film cans 

Luckily the person clearing the house was related to an expert in old film stock at the Library of Congress

It is the only known surviving footage of the 1924 World Series climax

The footage was shot on highly volatile nitrate film stock which burns easily

Normally such film has to be stored in a temperature controlled vault

Experts from the Library of Congress managed to salvage the footage

They transferred the moving images into a digital file and added sound
