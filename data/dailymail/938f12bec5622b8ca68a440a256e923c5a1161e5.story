As a fresh-faced Lance Corporal fighting for the British in Borneo, he single-handedly took out dozens of enemy soldiers before hauling two wounded comrades to safety through a hail of machine gun fire.

So it is unlikely that at 74, Captain Rambahadur Limbu, the only surviving Gurkha to win the Victoria Cross, was particularly nervous before addressing Parliament on the issue of the fearsome Nepalese soldiers’ welfare.

Captain Limbu, who was awarded the VC - Britain’s highest military decoration - for storming an enemy position during the Indonesian Confrontation in 1965, addressed the Gurkha Welfare Inquiry into the soldiers’ outstanding grievances.

Wearing his heavy row of medals on his 
left breast and walking with a stick, Limbu posed for pictures outside 
the Houses of Parliament in London.

The cross-party panel of lawmakers is considering the Gurkhas’ appeal for higher pensions and rights for their adult dependents in Nepal to settle in Britain.

The Gurkhas - known for their 
ferocity, loyalty, bravery and razor-sharp kukri fighting knives - first
 served as part of the Indian army in British-run India in 1815.

On November 21, 1965, after weeks of reconnaissance, Lance Corporal Rambahadur Limbu's 16-man squad was ordered to take out a key Indonesian position on the island of Borneo.

Around 150 yards from enemy lines they were spotted by a sentry. A second sentry in a tower opened fire. The Battle of Bau had begun.

Almost immediately one of Lance Corporal Limbu's comrades was shot in the stomach as he cocked his machine gun to return fire. Another Ghurka was then shot in the head.

Corporal Limbu quickly hurled a grenade to take out one of the sentries, but soon found himself the target of a hail of machine gun fire.

But rather than diving for cover he picked up the soldier who had been wounded in the stomach and carried him to safety. Then, as the bullets continued to fly, he went back once more for the soldier who had been shot in the head.

Cut off from the rest of the squad he crawled out of cover to grab a machine gun only to find it was broken. So he picked up a rifle and opened fire on the enemy reenforcements that were begining to arrive, killing several.

The Indonesians went into retreat with the British in pursuit.

At least 24 Indonesians were killed that day while the British lost three men killed and two wounded, one of them seriously.

Around 200,000 fought for Britain in World Wars I and II; some 43,000 were killed or wounded. Around 3,100 currently serve in the British army.

Gurkhas
 should get the same pay, pension and other conditions as their British 
counterparts for doing the same job, said the organisation Gurkha 
Satyagraha.

'The Gurkhas are
 a much valued part of the British army and are held in high self esteem
 and with considerable affection by the British public,' said lawmaker 
Jackie Doyle-Price, who is chairing the inquiry.

'Whilst
 there have been significant developments in recent years in terms of 
the pay and conditions of Gurkha soldiers and the extension of the right
 to settlement there remain some outstanding grievances which the 
Gurkhas are determined to have addressed.

'This
 will give the Gurkhas the opportunity to make their case to a committee
 of parliamentarians and for the Ministry of Defence to publicly address
 the points.'

The public hearings will continue into
 April. The government has pledged all relevant departments will 
cooperate fully with the inquiry.

The extremely rare VC, given for valour in the face of the enemy, takes precedence over all other military honours.

It
 is said they are struck from cannons captured at Sevastopol during the 
1853-1856 Crimean War in which Russia lost to Britain, France and the 
Ottoman Empire.

Besides 
Limbu there are only three other living holders of a British VC, four of
 the Australian VC and one of the New Zealand VC.

Known for their loyalty, courage and fearsome Kukri fighting knives, the Gurkhas are Nepalese soldiers who have fought for Britain for over 200 years.

More than 200,000 fought in the two world wars, and they have served in Kosovo, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Borneo, Cyprus, the Falklands, Burma, Java, Malaya, Egypt, Tunisia, Iran, Libya, Greece Iraq and Afghanistan.

Stories of extraordinary 
gallantry, such as that of Captain Limbu, are far from uncommon among the Gurkhas, and many involve tales of desperate hand to hand fighting involving the iconic kukri knives which every Gurkha carries.

Kukris are the traditional utility knives of the Nepalese people, but they are mainly 
known as the symbolic weapon for Gurkha regiments all over the world.

The kukri signifies courage and valour on the battlefield and is sometimes worn by bridegrooms during their wedding ceremony.

The kukri’s heavy blade inflicts deep wounds, cutting muscle and bone in one stroke. It can also be used in stealth operations to slash an enemy’s throat, killing him silently.

The Gurkhas are currently fighting for the right to claim the same pensions as their British comrades.

Their latest campaign follows the decision in May 2009 to allow all Gurkha soldiers with four or more years of service to settle in the UK with their wives.

Until 2007, Gurkha pensions were far lower than those of British soldiers as they were based on the cost of living in their homeland Nepal.

After widespread criticism, ministers decided that those who retired after 1997, when the Gurkhas were based in the UK instead of Hong Kong, could have a full pension.

Attempts to extend the benefit to all veterans have failed, and the latest bid in the Court of Appeal in October last year failed after the Court disagreed that the Ministry of Defence unlawfully discriminated against them on the grounds of age and race.An estimated 7,000 soldiers who retired before 1997 with service of under 15 years are forced to survive on charity handouts.
