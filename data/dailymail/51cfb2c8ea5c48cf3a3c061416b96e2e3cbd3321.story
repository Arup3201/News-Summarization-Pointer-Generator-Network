Relatives of a ginger Australian jihadist have condemned him for appearing in an Islamic State propaganda video in which he says the terror group will not stop their murderous campaign 'until the black flag is flying high in every single land'. 

In chilling footage published on YouTube, white Sydney-born Muslim convert Abdullah Elmir, 17, calls himself 'Abu Khaled from Australia' and is seen flanked by other militants. 

Speaking directly to the camera, the jihadist tells Western leaders their efforts to defeat ISIS will fail, adding that the terrorists aim to raise their black flag over Buckingham Palace and the White House. 

When he disappeared from his home in Bankstown, west Sydney, in June, Elmir reportedly told his mother he was 'going fishing' but never returned. Now, after seeing him in the video, relatives have branded him a 'stupid idiot', adding that he has been 'brainwashed'.

Sydney teen Abdullah Elmir reportedly told his mother he was 'going fishing' when he disappeared from his home in Bankstown in June

Elmir and his friend Feiz are believed to have made their way to Syria and Iraq after crossing the border from Turkey, where they were last known to have contacted family members. They travelled via Perth, with stops in Malaysia and Thailand.

'What a stupid idiot,' an unnamed relative told the Daily Telegraph.

'We never associated with him, that guy was brainwashed, I don't know what these kids get into.'

'They don't know how to fight... they should be getting an education and building this country up.' 

He begins the video by saying 'this message I deliver to you the people of America, this message I deliver to you the people of Britain and this message I deliver especially to you the people of Australia'. 

Titled 'Message Of The Mujahid 4', the 1.43 minutes long video is full of threats against the west

Titled 
'Message Of The Mujahid 4', the video which is 1.43 minutes long is full
 of threats and taunts to the US-led coalition that recently began air 
strikes on ISIS targets in Syria and Iraq.

'I
 say this about your coalition: you threaten us with your countries, 
bring every nation that you wish to us, bring every nation that you want
 to come and fight us. Whether it's 50 nations or 50 thousand nations it
 means nothing to us,' Elmir says.

Reading
 from a script, a black and white scarf wrapped around his head and an 
assault rifle in his hand, he warns: 'Bring your planes bring everything
 you want to use because it will not harm us because we have Allah which
 is something you do not have.'

A spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Abbott said: 'This video again highlights the threat posed by ISIL.'

'As the Prime Minister has said on many occasions, ISIL is a threat that reaches out to Australia and our allies and partners.'

ISIL is another name for ISIS.

'We know they have the intelligence to pinpoint him.

'The
 concern is that he’s being used as a tracking device to gather further 
intelligence, to see where he's actually going to go.'

Ms Burrows questioned how Elmir  was not stopped by Federal Police, who were thought to be monitoring him.

On
 Sunday, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop announced Australia will send its
 special forces into Iraq to fight against Islamic State. 

Elmir's video was published one day after the announcement.

'Is it not apparent to you how are these victories are possible?,' he asks.

'It comes only from Allah and that is why these small numbers of soldiers that we have we take these massive victories.

'And
 to the leaders, to the Obama, to Tony Abbott, I say to you this: these 
weapons that we have, these soldiers will not stop fighting, we will not
 put down our weapons until we reach your lands, until we take the head 
of every tyrant and until the black flag is flying high in 
every single land.'

On
 October 10, a young Australian named Abu Ousama, working as a combat 
medic for a terror group in Syria, said he is still a 'true blue Aussie'
 despite condoning the brutal beheadings by ISIS

A young convert to Islam who killed a Canadian soldier in a hit-and-run had been on the radar of federal investigators, who feared he had jihadist ambitions and seized his passport when he tried to travel to Turkey, authorities said Tuesday.

Public Safety Minister Steven Blaney said the attack Monday was 'clearly linked to terrorist ideology.' Quebec Police spokesman Guy Lapointe said the act was deliberate and that one of the two soldiers was in uniform.

Police said the suspect, Martin Couture-Rouleau, called 911 to report his hit-and-run as police chased him in the Quebec city of Saint-Jean-Sur-Richelieu.

He later was shot dead by police after his car flipped over into a ditch and he brandished a knife as he exited his car. A second soldier suffered minor injuries in the attack.

 Three teenage girls from suburban Denver may have been trying to join Islamic State militants in Syria after stealing their parents' money and flying to Germany, authorities said Tuesday.

The girls — two sisters, ages 17 and 15, and their 16-year-old friend — were reported missing after they skipped school Friday, but the families had no indication of where they might have gone, said Glenn Thompson, bureau chief of the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Department

Suspicion arose when the sisters' father realized his daughters were gone, along with $2,000 and their passports. 

They were stopped at the Frankfurt, Germany, airport over the weekend by FBI agents and returned to Colorado where they were reunited with their families, an FBI spokeswoman said.

'We will keep on fighting and we will fight you and defeat you,' he states.

As his hate-filled diatribe finishes he begins chanting in Arabic and the fighters around him join in. 

Monash University terror expert Professor Greg Barton said Abu Khaled was an unknown quantity.

'The big thing is this is the third time Australia's been clearly in the frame,' Prof Barton said.

A
 month ago, Islamic State spokesman Abu Mohammad Al-Adnani urged his 
followers to murder people of a number of nationalities, including 
Australians.

'Smash
 his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over 
with your car, or throw him down from a high place, or choke him,' 
Al-Adnani said.

Ten days ago, the Islamic State's official magazine, Dabiq, also singled out Australians.

'At this point of the crusade against the Islamic State, it is very important that attacks take place in every country that has entered into the alliance against the Islamic State, especially the US, UK, France, Australia and Germany,' it said. 

Prime 
Minister Tony Abbott explained on Wednesday that 200 members of the 
Australian special forces had been waiting in the United Arab Emirates 
since mid-September to take on ISIS because Baghdad had not offered them
 formal legal protections.

And
 Australia launched their first air strikes against Islamic State 
targets inside the country earlier this month as part of the U.S.-led 
coalition.

There
 are thought to be over 100 Australians fighting with ISIS in the Middle
 East, including Sydney-born friends Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar.

 militants took over Tabqa air base, in nearby Raqqa city

Sharrouf and Elomar have repeatedly taunted the authorities on social media with photos of alleged beheadings of Syrian soldiers.

And on October 10, a young Australian named Abu Ousama, working as a combat medic for a terror group in Syria, said he is still a 'true blue Aussie' despite condoning the brutal beheadings by ISIS.

Ousama is living among rebel fighters for Jund al-Aqsa. He took part in an interview broadcast on 7News by British photojournalist Tam Hussain who lived with the 1000 strong Islamic battalion group, which is independent of ISIS but supports their ideology.

'ISIS have taken this role of protecting the innocent Muslims of this country, of this land.

'So, they have to do what they need to do to make their state,' he said.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted the Attorney General's office, the Prime Minister and DFAT for comment on the latest video.
