A mother-of-two was today being investigated by police after saying she hoped some of the hundreds of people who drowned off the coast of Italy were Muslims.

Housewife Nicky Hutt was branded a racist after posting the slur on Facebook following the tragedy last Thursday, which saw 232 African immigrants die in a desperate bid to reach Lampedusa, Sicily.

The 35-year-old from Poole, Dorset, said: ‘News night tonight... Top headline. 200 Africans drown in boat disaster. What a shame, hopefully a few of them were Muslims.’

Mrs Hutt - who has two children aged two and seven - said she had been drinking when she posted the comment, and had just watched a documentary on last month’s mall massacre in Nairobi, Kenya.

Her Facebook post sparked outrage among the Muslim community, with leaders branding Mrs Hutt's comments ‘disgusting’ and ‘upsetting’.

Majid Yasin, director of the Bournemouth Islamic Centre and Central Mosque, said: ‘Anyone who makes such comments about the desperate people who had died must have a heart of stone.

‘This is disgusting. If she said it about Jewish people or Christians I would be upset.’

Adnan Chaudry, chief officer for the Dorset Race Equality Council, added: ‘To see those comments is very disturbing.

‘This is a tragedy for which Italy held a national day of mourning, which shows the sympathy and empathy for these people.

‘People have to be really desperate to put their lives in danger as they did in this disaster. I don't know how someone could make those comments.’

Mrs Hutt said: ‘Last Friday I had drunk some alcohol and had just watched a documentary about the Jihadist Kenya massacre. I posted an article on Facebook which regrettably offended some good and decent Muslim friends of mine.

'I genuinely regret the original posting which does not reflect my normal view about my Muslim friends'

‘I would like to make it clear that the post was deleted by me within only one hour of its original posting. I also posted an apology over the weekend. I genuinely regret the original posting which does not reflect my normal view about my Muslim friends.’

Mrs Hutt's hairdresser Esra Turay, herself a Muslim, said: ‘These racist remarks are really upsetting.

‘It's wrong to have these extreme views. 
It just does not add up - she is nice to my face but she obviously hates
 Muslims. This sort of point of view just makes everyone angry.’

In Mrs Hutt's apology she said she 
‘genuinely regretted’ posting her comments, however she then sent a 
crude text message sent to Mrs Turay contradicting herself.

The vile rant, in response to Mrs Turay sharing Mrs Hutt's comments on her own Facebook page, read: ‘How dare you post something from my page. It's called freedom of speech in my country okay.

‘I can post what the f*** I like. I'm sorry it's come to this. And yes, my opinions are extreme. But that's my decision. Not yours to broadcast.

‘That was f***ing out of order. If you were that disgusted you should have just deleted me, not did what you did.'

Mrs Turay, from Bournemouth, said: ‘I'm not trying to start a war at all, I just want peace, but racism like this has to be exposed. She is my client and I didn't want it to come to this but it is offensive to read comments like this.

‘She said publicly she was sorry and that she had been drinking the night she posted the remarks but then she sent me a nasty text message that proved she isn't sorry. Extreme views like this need to be stopped.’

Mrs Hutt told MailOnline she would not comment further.

She is a former employee and 
non-executive director of telecoms firm 4Com, which 
installs and services business phone lines around Britain - although she
 has not been actively involved with the company for three years.

Her
 husband Daron Hutt, 50, is chairman of the Bournemouth-based company, 
which said it came 45th in this year's Sunday Times Top 100 Best Small 
Companies to Work For list.

Mr Hutt said in a company statement: '4Com is very proud of its brilliant record for employing 
and looking after its staff.

'These racist remarks are really upsetting. It's wrong to have these extreme views'

'4Com is also very proud to employ some Muslim staff and also 150 people from a wide variety of backgrounds. Mrs Hutt is a former non-executive director and former employee and takes no part in the running of 4Complc in any way.

'We do not share the views in her post and wish to express our utmost sympathy for all effected by the boat disaster.'

A
 Dorset Police spokesman said: ‘We've had a report of a racist message 
placed on Facebook. It was reported to us by a Poole woman and we are 
investigating.’

Mrs Hutt told MailOnline she would not comment further.
