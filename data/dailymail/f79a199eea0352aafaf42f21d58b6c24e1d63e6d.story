Resigned: Sir Norman Bettison will step down next year

The head of West Yorkshire Police will stand down after being accused of smearing fans in the wake of the Hillsborough tragedy.

Sir Norman Bettison said the move will allow independent officials to fully investigate the devastating allegations about his integrity.

The chief constable said the recent uproar made him 'reflect' on 'what is best for the future of policing' in his force area.

Two weeks ago he was accused of being involved in a South Yorkshire Police 'black propaganda' campaign set up to smear fans in the days after Hillsborough.

The top officer was also forced to issue a humiliating apology after saying Liverpool fans were partly to blame for what happened.

He faced calls to resign from the families of victims for criticising fans' behaviour despite an independent panel clearing them of wrongdoing.

Sir Norman, 56, said he will retire from his £225,000 post on March 31 next year, despite being recently granted an extension to his contract.

It remains to be seen whether he will receive any extra pay off over his gold-plated public sector pension of up to £150,000 a year.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is investigating Sir Norman's conduct in the aftermath of Hillsborough.

The damning report on the Hillsborough disaster laid bare a shocking cover-up which attempted to shift the blame on to its 96 victims.

The inquiry found that 164 police statements were altered, 116 of them to remove or alter 'unfavourable' comments about the policing of the match and the unfolding disaster.

The
watchdog said it is conducting a 'detailed assessment' of a referral 
from West Yorkshire Police Authority. It is also examining his comments 
last month.

Supporters of Sir Norman said he has been the victim of a 'witch-hunt' in the wake of the release of the explosive Hillsborough report.

In a statement released last night, he said: 'Recent weeks have caused me to reflect on what is best for the future of policing in West Yorkshire and I have now decided to set a firm date for my retirement of March 31, 2013.

'Furthermore, I hope it will enable 
the Independent Police Complaints Commission to fully investigate 
allegations that have been raised about my integrity.

'They need to be fairly and fully investigated and I welcome this independent and formal scrutiny.'

Margaret Aspinall, chairwoman of the 
Hillsborough Families Support Group, said: 'Obviously I’m very, very 
pleased. I’m absolutely delighted that he’s going.

'But then he’ll be going on his full 
pension, and I’d like to know the full reasons why he’s choosing to 
retire as soon as this.'

Mrs Aspinall, whose 18-year-old son 
James died in the tragedy, said: 'Why didn’t he stay, then, until the 
IPCC came out with their investigation?

'But he’s decided to leave. I’m not arguing against it, because I’m thrilled that he is going.'

Sir Norman, who began his policing career in South Yorkshire, has denied any wrongdoing in relation to the disaster.

Anne Williams, whose 15-year-old son 
Kevin died on the Leppings Lane terrace, said the findings of the recent
report left Sir Norman with no choice but to retire.

She said: 'I think the whole lot of 
them who have been involved for these 23 years should all go for the 
hurt that they have caused us for 23 years.

'I don’t think he would have retired if it wasn’t for the Hillsborough report.'

Trevor Hicks, who lost his two 
daughters, 19-year-old Sarah and 15-year-old Victoria, told ITV News: 
'I’m glad he’s realised his position 
is untenable, however I’m determined that he does not escape his just 
desserts and I will make sure he’s stripped of his knighthood.

'He should leave with nothing, like he tried to leave the families.'

Questions about Sir Norman’s role in 
the investigation of the tragedy have dogged him as he has risen through
the higher ranks of the police - most notably when there were protests 
from the families of those who died when he became Chief Constable of 
Merseyside in 1998.

Undeterred
by this opposition, Sir Norman stayed on in Liverpool for six years and
was even named an honorary fellow of the city’s John Moores University.

After retiring from the police in 2004 to become the chief executive of Centrex, a firm which offered training to police forces, he was knighted for services to policing in 2006.

Returning to an active role in the police and Yorkshire, Sir Norman became West Yorkshire Police’s chief constable in January 2007 and was designated the officer responsible for overseeing policing of domestic extremism.

Last month he was singled out as the 
most senior serving policeman allegedly involved in a 'black propaganda'
campaign that followed the 1989 stadium disaster.

He was part of a South Yorkshire 
Police unit which tried to ensure the force was exonerated over the 
tragedy and fans were put in the spotlight.

The report revealed that as a chief 
inspector he produced a video for MPs which highlighted how a pitch 
invasion was 'thought' to have happened.

It added that policing a match was 'reliant on some co-operation' from fans.

Liverpool MP Maria Eagle said the unit he was part of was nothing more than a 'black propaganda' campaign.

But Sir Norman insisted he had 'nothing to hide' as a clamour for him to resign intensified but sparked fresh fury by placing some blame on fans.

He stressed he had played no role in changing officers' accounts of what happened, saying: 'I never altered a statement nor asked for one to be altered.'

He pointed out that he had been off-duty and attended the fateful FA Cup semi-final match as a fan, immediately joining the police effort.

In 1998, several police authority members quit when Sir Norman was made chief of Merseyside over his role in preparing the police response to Hillsborough.

In April 2010, Sir Norman raised eyebrows by saying that he was not worth his bumper pay and pension package.

He said huge pay awards were 'untenable' and many employed by the state were following a vocation and would happily do the job for less pay.
