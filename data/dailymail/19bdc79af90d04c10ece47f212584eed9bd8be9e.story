Police are on the hunt for Joseph Kernizan, who they suspect murdered his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend in the parking lot of a Bronx motel early Saturday.

Kernizan, 42, was waiting when Tracy Bennet, 38, and boyfriend Wayne Hamilton, 50 emerged from the 
Holiday Motel around 3:10 a.m, witnesses told police.

The jilted lover then fired more than two dozen 
bullets at the defenseless pair, killing them outside the Holiday Motel at 2291 New England Thruway.

Bennet had time to scream: 'Don't do it! Don't do it!' before Kernizan allegedly pulled the trigger

The
incident took place after Kernizan approached Hamilton, a reggaeton 
singer, outside the motel office at around 3.15am, police said.

Hamilton, who goes by the stage name Captain Barkey, was shot several times in the back of the head as he tried to run away.

Kernizan
then turned his attention to his 38-year-old girlfriend standing near a
parked Toyota Camry with the motor running and shot her in the head as 
well.

Witnesses who 
were celebrating a birthday in a room upstairs said they overheard four 
to five gunshots break out, 1010 WINS reported, before running to see 
what was happening.

'I looked out my window and saw a lady standing there,' party guest Ricky Gugliotta told the New York Daily News.

'She was begging him not to shoot her, but then he shot her twice and she went down.'

Both Bennett and Hamilton were pronounced dead at the scene by EMS.

Kernizan fled the scene in a blue or green sedan, sources told the Daily News.

Motel patron Augustine Mawugbe, 45, told DNAInfo he was asleep in his room when he heard gunshots.

Crime scene: The cold-blooded murders took place in the parking lot of Holiday Motel in The Bronx

Mawugbe said he looked outside and saw a tall man in a brown polo shirt firing a pistol.

‘He
jumped into the car and drove away. He drove fast,’ he added. He said 
the man fired about ten times, and got into a light green Toyota Camry 
or Ford Taurus.

Bennett’s neighbors told the Daily News they often heard her and Kernizan 
screaming at each other and police were regularly called to their tidy 
two-story home.

“We always heard them fighting,” said Carolina Manzano.

While neighbors described Bennett, a mother of three, as a sweet woman who was seen 
leaving her house every morning in nurse scrubs, they said Kernizan stayed out late and often returned in flashy cars.

Hamilton's
friends who stopped by the crime scene Saturday afternoon said he was 
originally from Jamaica but was now living in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

‘I saw him last night at Memories playing dominoes,’ said Oneil Taylor, referring to a Bronx nightclub.

Another
friend, an shuttle driver, said he had picked up Hamilton Friday from 
the airport and brought him to the Fenton Avenue club. 

Tragedy: Guests at the motel saw Hamilton and his girlfriend celebrating with a bottle of Champagne just hours before the murders

The New York Times
said that the victims were staying in a room on the motel’s second 
floor. Other guests reported seeing the slain couple several hours 
before the murders with their arms around one another.

Bennett was spotted by one patron holding a bottle of Champagne in a celebratory manner.
