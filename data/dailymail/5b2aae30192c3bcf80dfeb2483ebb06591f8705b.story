Chico the monkey hasn't needed to use too many French pickup lines on his 12 new female friends since they moved into his home at Sydney's Taronga Zoo.

But as the zoo's only male Squirrel Monkey, Chico has definitely had his work cut out for him since his new companions joined him from a zoo in France earlier this year.

A few of the ladies brought with them babies from their ex-boyfriends in France - forcing Chico to keep an open mind.

'Chico certainly has his hands full with 12 new females,' primate keeper Lisa Ridley said.

Two new-born boys have been spotted clinging to their mothers like tiny, furry backpacks in the recently renovated exhibit.

'Now eight weeks old, the babies are alert and can often be glimpsed on the backs of other females in the group,' Ms Ridley said.

Ms Ridley said it had been a long time since the trees of the Amazonia exhibit had seen such a large group of monkeys.

'They have such high energy, are always on the go and are never boring,' she said.
