A New York man has been arrested after he allegedly groped a sleeping woman aboard a United Airlines flight from Tokyo to New Jersey.

Eun Jong Lee was detained upon arrival Sunday night at Newark Liberty International Airport and was charged with abusive sexual contact, a felony carrying a maximum two-year prison term and a $250,000 fine.

The 47-year-old Ithaca resident made his initial court appearance Monday in U.S. District Court in Newark.

Arrested: New York man Eun Jong Lee has been arrested after he allegedly groped a sleeping woman aboard a United Airlines flight from Tokyo to New Jersey

He was represented by a federal public defender, and federal prosecutors said he did not enter a plea during the session.

Lee faces up to two years in prison if convicted.

Prosecutors said Lee was seated next to a woman he did not know on the 13-hour United Airlines flight 78.Â 

They said while the plane was in the air, the woman, who was traveling alone woke up to find Lee's hand on the front of her shirt, touching her breast through her clothing.

Lee then allegedly touched the skin of her neck and attempted to put his hand down the front of her shirt, prosecutors said.

The woman said she asked Lee to stop touching her.

She then reported the incident to a flight crew member and provided that person with a written statement describing what happened, prosecutors said.

An after-hours message for Lee's public defender was not returned.

In March, 66-year-old California man Hans Loudermilk was arrested for groping a 15-year-old girl on a Delta flight and telling her he could 'teach her things' about sex.

Loudermilk is facing federal charges after he allegedly rubbed the inner thigh of the girl on a 90 minute Delta flight from Los Angeles to Salt Late City, Utah.
