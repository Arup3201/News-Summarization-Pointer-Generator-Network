A seagull calmly bobs on the surface of the sea unaware it is just inches away from the jaws of death.

This remarkable photograph of a beady-eyed great white shark homing in on its unsuspecting prey echoes the iconic poster for Steven Spielberg's 1975 blockbuster Jaws.

But incredibly, despite the ocean beast looking set to devour the seagull in seconds, the shark gave the bird nothing more than a fright.

Jaws of death: Great white shark swims within inches of an unsuspecting seagull on the surface

The picture was taken by marine photographer Erin Quigley on a diving expedition in Isla Guadalupe, Mexico.

Ms Quigley, who took a series photographs from within a shark cage while the animals lurked around her, said: 'I was 16 when Jaws was released, and my siblings and I were obsessed.

'My sister had the poster from the film, showing a hapless swimmer about to be devoured, on her wall, and it was so terrifying that I used to avert my eyes as I passed it on my way to bed at night.

'But this time I was hoping to capture a similar drama on camera. A group of seagulls had landed on the water, attracted by bait we were using to lure the sharks.

'From above the water, the gulls didn't seem afraid or even very concerned about the sharks, just peeved when one took a swipe at them.

'In fact, it was surprising how half-heartedly the sharks pursued the gulls, and how little energy the gulls had to use to get away. But once we got underwater, it revealed an entirely different story.

'Even the slowest approach of the enormous shark towards the tiny, vulnerable feet of the gull created an encounter full of life-and-death suspense.'

Ms Quigley's trip took place after a hurricane and the sea was rougher than usual at the diving site.

The photographer had never even been in a shark cage before and was said she was surprised how hard it was to manage the camera while rattling around in side it.

She added: 'I just got lucky with this photo. This young shark had been toying with the gulls all day, bumping their feet with his nose and then swimming off.

'He finally picked on one that was close enough for me to get a decent shot of. '
