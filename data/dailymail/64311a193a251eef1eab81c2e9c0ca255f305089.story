A newly-revealed video shows the head coach of the Rutgers men's basketball team hitting players with basketballs and gay slurs in what a former team official calls a horrific pattern of abuse.

The clip shows a number of disturbing and violent actions taken by Coach Mike Rice toward his players during team practices.

At one point on the video, obtained and released by ESPN, Rice unloads a homophobic rant against one of his players, saying: 'You f***ing fairy! You’re a f***ing f****t!'

Violence: The video shows several moments when Rice angrily pushed, shoved and grabbed his players during practices

Anger: In this clip, Rice, in white, is seen getting into the face of one of the Rutgers players

Slurs: In one portion of the video, Rice unloads a homophobic rant against one of his players, saying: 'You f***ing fairy! You¿re a f***ing f****t!' 

And his rants were not just limited to the verbal.

The footage shows Rice grabbing, kicking and shoving players - and even hurling basketballs at them.

The video was provided to ESPN by Eric Murdock, a former NBA player who also served as Rutgers' director of player development from 2010-2012.

Murdock, a former college standout 
who played with teams like the Utah Jazz and 
New Jersey (now Brooklyn) Nets, was hired by Rutgers in 2010 as director
of player development.

He told ESPN that it wasn't long before he reported Rice's aggressive behavior to Rutgers athletic director Tim Pernetti.

Complaint: Murdock says that it wasn't long before he reported Rice's aggressive behavior to Rutgers athletic director Tim Pernetti, pictured right with Rice

But Rice was not disciplined until Murdock showed him the footage in November.

A month later, Rice was suspended for three games without pay and fined $50,000 in December for what was described as inappropriate behavior and language.

Rice returned to his duties as head coach in a game on January 2 against Syracuse.

Pernetti said in an interview with 
ESPN on Tuesday that he issued the suspension after he was shown the 
tape and conducted an investigation into the matter.

He said that Rice was penalized appropriately for a 'first offense.'

Pernetti nor director of athletic communications Kevin Lorincz returned messages from MailOnline for comment.

When asked about the suspension at the time, Pernetti said: 'I was made aware of some things within the last couple of weeks. We commenced a thorough, lengthy and fair investigation and this was the result of that investigation.

'There was obviously some things that are not to the Rutgers' standard that we evaluated and decided upon.'

In an interview with WFAN, Pernetti said university president Robert Barchi saw the tape and concurred with his actions against Rice.

ESPN aired the videotape on Tuesday and it has many on social media criticizing Rutgers, including NBA superstar LeBron James.

Murdock stayed with the team for two years until July 2012, when his contract was not renewed.

Murdock claims he was fired after he reported Rice’s antics, a claim Pernetti denies.

His attorney Raj Gadhok told ESPN: 'Mr Murdock was terminated for having complained of and reported illegal conduct by Mike Rice. As a result, his employment was terminated by Rutgers University.

'That’s unlawful in the state of New Jersey and Eric intends to pursue legal action for his wrongful termination, which he university and its representatives had been aware of for some time now.'

Criticism: As the clip has spread, it has drawn a rebuke from many on social media, including NBA superstar LeBron James
