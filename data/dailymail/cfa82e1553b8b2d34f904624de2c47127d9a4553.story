A mother and child were tied up at knifepoint by a masked burglar who carried out a 'horrific sexual assault' during an early-morning raid in a Somerset market town.

The knife-wielding sex attacker broke into the home in Sydenham, Bridgwater, before carrying out the assault while wearing a balaclava-style mask and a high-visibility jacket.

He then threatened the mother and child with a knife, before demanding money and jewellery, but is believed to have fled from the property empty-handed. A knife was later found in a nearby garden.

He said: 'We're treating this as an horrific incident in which a mother and her child were tied up and threatened at knifepoint by an unknown man. This is an upsetting case and all the support that we can provide to the victims is being done.  

'An offence of this gravity will naturally cause concern in the local community and I'd like to reassure people that we've got a team of experienced detectives and officers working on the case that are determined to identify this individual and bring him to justice.

'Incidents like this are rare and isolated. We're looking after the victims who've been through an horrendous ordeal and are giving them all the help and support they need.' 

Police hunting the burglar have carried out 250 house-to-house inquiries and  have received information about the man's sightings and movements after the incident

Officers say they have already received a number of potential sightings and information about the man's movements following the incident.

He added: 'During the course of our inquiry we've carried out house-to-house inquiries at more than 250 properties and are following up on any leads resulting from these visits.

'It's likely there will be an ongoing police presence as we continue making inquiries to piece together what happened.'

He was also wearing a black or dark grey mask with holes for the eye and mouth, as well as a grey hood, dark-coloured tracksuit bottoms and white trainers.

A man matching his description was seen in Dunwear Lane at about 8.12am on the day of the burglary, before being spotted running towards the junction of Westonzoyland Road.

He turned left into Westonzoyland Road and disappeared from sight but was caught on CCTV near St John and St Francis Primary School.

A fence was also broken in St David's Court, possibly about the time the incident happened.

Detectives have already discovered a kitchen knife, matching the description of the weapon used, in a garden in nearby Somerville Way. 

Det Ch Insp  Williams added: 'The offender had his face covered but I'm urging people to look at the following description and think about whether they saw someone matching it on the morning of Wednesday 21 January, or at any point during the day of the incident or the days before.

'Equally if you know someone who wears clothing similar to those worn by the offender was wearing, we'd like to speak to you.'

Anyone with information is asked to contact the force on 101, quoting log number 207 of 05/02, or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
