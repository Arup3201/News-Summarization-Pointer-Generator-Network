Britain’s Armed Forces Minister told MPs not to believe a disabled Afghan war hero’s account of how he was callously bullied by his regimental sergeant major.

Just days after the Ministry of Defence apologised to Corporal Tom Neathway, 30, over his appalling three-year ordeal, it has emerged that the Minister, Anna Soubry, described accounts of his allegations as ‘misleading’ in a private letter to MPs.

Last night Cpl Neathway, who lost both legs and an arm fighting the Taliban, said Ms Soubry had unfairly branded him a liar and demanded her resignation.

Armed Forces Minister Anna Soubry, right, said MPs should not believe that Corporal Tom Neathway, left, who lost three limbs while in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, was also bullied by his Regimental Sergeant Major

He said: ‘I suffered horrendous treatment and the Army has acknowledged that. But she called me a liar and she should go. She’s not right for the Armed Forces job.’

Ms Soubry is leading the Army’s latest anti-bullying drive and is responsible for overhauling the Services’ complaints process.

Last night, members of the House of Commons’ Defence Select Committee said she should be stripped of these roles, describing her as ‘tainted’.

Last week, a military Service Complaint Panel finally acknowledged that Cpl Neathway had suffered a campaign of bullying by his sergeant major, Alistair Hutcheson, who whispered in the triple amputee’s ear that, as a result of his injuries, he ‘wasn’t much of a paratrooper any more’.

Cpl Neathway, who remained hugely proud that he belonged to the Parachute Regiment, described his ordeal for the first time in an interview with this newspaper in February. The following month, The Mail on Sunday revealed that RSM Hutcheson was quitting the Army.

A number of MPs wrote to Ms Soubry in her capacity as Armed Forces Minister following these articles to pass on the concerns of their constituents. In her written response, she cast doubt over Cpl Neathway’s story by telling MPs the stories were ‘inaccurate’ and ‘misleading’.

Army authorities apologised to Cpl Neathway after Sergeant Major Alastair Hutchenson, pictured told him 'he wasn't much of a paratrooper anymore' after he lost three limbs while fighting in Afghanistan 

Ms Soubry wrote to an MP that they should not 'believe everything they read or see' in the media 

She said: ‘While I recognise that members of the public receive much of their information from the media, and this helps to form their views on issues such as this, I would counsel them to not to believe everything they read or see.

‘I would like to assure you and your constituents that all three Services have a zero tolerance of bullying and harassment and all allegations are taken very seriously and are thoroughly investigated, as has happened in this case.’

In fact, in the three years after Cpl Neathway lodged his complaint, a clique of Army officers conspired to block its progress.

The disabled soldier was given an ultimatum: Drop the claim or leave the military base that had been specially adapted to allow him to work there. There were also attempts to discredit Army and civilian personnel who had provided witness statements backing Cpl Neathway’s legal action.

Last week, Ms Soubry, who has been fast-tracked into ministerial office by David Cameron, tried to shift the blame for her letter on to defence officials. When contacted by The Mail on Sunday, she said: ‘I only go, as you know, on what they [officials] tell me. I make sure that my team write letters on the basis of what I am told. It doesn’t mean to say that I personally asserted anything other than what they told me.’

Just minutes later, an official contacted this newspaper and suggested that Ms Soubry had issued a stern rebuke.

Last year, when she was serving as a junior Minister in the Department of Health, she was criticised for suggesting she could tell somebody’s social background by whether or not they were fat.

Yesterday, the MPs Jeffrey Donaldson, Gisela Stuart and Sir Bob Russell, who sit on the Commons’ defence committee, questioned Ms Soubry’s suitability to lead the Army’s anti-bullying drive. Sir Bob said: ‘She is tainted by what she has written and her impartiality has to be questioned.

‘Cpl Neathway’s treatment by some elements of the Army was an absolute disgrace.

‘Ms Soubry’s involvement in this case is such that this part [the anti-bullying drive] of her portfolio should be handled by another Minister. The Ministry of Defence remains the Government’s least open department.’

Ms Soubry issued a statement saying: ‘Bullying and harassment have no place in the Army.

‘Our personnel can have confidence in the complaints system, which we are improving further to add a powerful, independent voice to the process.’

Last night Ms Soubry reacted with ‘surprise’ to calls for her resignation. She said: ‘I am surprised and disappointed as I take these issues very seriously, which is why I’m pleased to be guiding the draft legislation through Parliament.’

Though he has left the Army, RSM Hutcheson still faces disciplinary action.
