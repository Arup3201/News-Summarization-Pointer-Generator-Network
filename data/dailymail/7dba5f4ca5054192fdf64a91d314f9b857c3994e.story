Ask Alex Song who the best player in the world is and his answer is emphatic: 'Lionel Messi. Oh my God.' 

On Wednesday night, the East End welcomes the Barcelona superstar with open arms as the Boleyn Ground plays host to a mouth-watering international between Argentina and Croatia.

Of course, the likelihood is that Messi won't play the full 90 minutes. But who cares? Even a brief glimpse of the great man on the green grass of Upton Park will be an unforgettable treat for the 17,000 fans expected to be in attendance.

Last week, Messi created history by equalling Raul's all-time European goalscoring record with a brace at Ajax.

By doing so, he instantly poured scorn over bizarre comments made by Argentina's national boss Tata Martino.

Martino, who lasted just one year in charge at Barcelona, voiced concern that the 27-year-old 'may never capture his best form again'.

'I don't know if we'll have the chance to see it happen,' Martino told Spanish sports daily, Marca. 'It's like when people compare Barcelona now to what they were like under Guardiola.'

Admittedly, there have been doubts over Messi’s fitness. He’s played every possible minute for Barca in La Liga so far this season.

And naturally, his form took a dip as he strived to get over the agony of Argentina's World Cup final defeat by Germany.

But with his match-winning double in Amsterdam, he proved he is still the menacing Messi of old.

He now sits proudly at the top of the queue to eclipse the Champions League feat of Real Madrid legend Raul - and one ahead of his arch-nemesis, Cristiano Ronaldo.

The two will again go head-to-head at the beginning of December in their battle to land the coveted Ballon d'Or award.

Victory for Messi, who was named the best player at the World Cup last summer despite Argentina's Rio heartache, would surely coronate him as the game's best ever.

But for Song, West Ham's on-loan midfielder from Barcelona, there is no doubt that title already belongs to his mercurial friend.

'Lionel Messi. Oh… I think this guy is fantastic. He’s the best player I have ever seen in my life,' says Song, who spent the past two seasons playing alongside the diminutive genius at the Nou Camp.

'Honestly, I’ve played with a lot of great players in my career. I was very lucky to play with players like Thierry Henry, Robert Pires, Dennis Bergkamp... it was a privilege for me.

'And then I went to Barcelona to play with Andres Iniesta, Xavi… and, of course, Leo Messi. It’s fantastic.'

West Ham’s Under 21 side saw first-hand how brilliant the great man is when Argentina played a practice game against them on Tuesday evening at the club’s Rush Green Academy base.

So what separates Messi from the rest? His incredible hunger and desire, according to Song.

'For me, Leo is one of the players who is just unbelievable,’ he adds.

'I see young players like Neymar who is the future best player in the world like this guy.

'But the level Messi is at is just unbelievable. Messi is up here [Song stretches his arms far and wide]… and everyone else is below. Let’s just say, it’s a very big gap. A big gap.

'The thing I like about Leo is he is so hungry. He wants to win everything. He’s won everything but still wants to win more.

'He’s a great guy. He’s a winner. The way he manages himself to try and improve himself is a great example to other players and young boys.'

Song has been in good form since joining West Ham in the summer from Barcelona on loan

Song's own future is uncertain. He could return to Barcelona next summer but he is happy at West Ham, where he has shone so far this season in Sam Allardyce's side.

Perhaps Song could tempt Messi to prolong his short-stay in the East End and join him in January?

'Ha... why not! It would be good.'

Indeed it would. Hopefully Wednesday won't mark the last time we ever see the masterful Messi grace English soil.
