A sister who lost her brother in the Afghan War is to wed the soldier who battled to save his life.

Rosie-Ann Stone, of Atwick, near Hornsea, East Yorks, was devastated when her sibling, Private Gregg Stone, 20, was shot dead on 3rd June 2012, while on a mission to rescue an Afghan policeman kidnapped by the Taliban.

She found comfort in Liam Fisher, 22, also a private in 3rd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment, who was a friend of her brothers and tried valiantly to save his life.

He was lucky to survive himself after a bullet hit his helmet as he dragged his dying friend into a ditch, before lying on top of him to protect him.

However, Gregg had been hit by a bullet in the neck which severed his main artery and he died of his wounds at the scene.

Describing the moment Gregg was killed, Liam said: 'In training, you're told to win the firefight before you tend to the wounded.

'No - you get to the person first. It was chaos. It was jungle. You couldn't see anything.

'The platoon commander told us to keep 10m apart, but I turned to Gregg and said, "It's 5m for me and you". Then the rounds came flying.'

Rosie-Ann, 22, met Liam at Gregg's inquest, which was held in Hull in May last year.

They stayed in touch by exchanging Facebook messages and soon realised they wanted to be more than just friends. They arranged their first date in the seaside resort Bridlington in August last year.

Rosie-Ann, 22, said: 'When we got together, people were sceptical. People thought, "Is she just looking for comfort?" or "is she just looking for a replacement brother?"

'But our relationship is founded on merit. I love Liam for everything he is. He is genuine.

'People contact you when there is tragedy, saying they'll support you. Liam was different. He just wanted to get to know me. It was really refreshing.'

Now the couple plan to marry in York Minster as the Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, has granted a special marriage licence after hearing of Liam's bravery.

Rosie-Ann said she feels Gregg would have been happy about her tying the knot with his comrade. 

She said: 'Gregg would be giddy. He would be shocked, but he'd be so pleased.

'Mum and Dad say they feel as though Gregg sent Liam to me.'

Liam added: 'I'm sure Gregg would have sat me down and grilled me. He would have told me to look after his little sister, but he would be pleased.'

Gregg's widow, Sam, will be a bridesmaid at the couple's wedding next March, while his daughter, Grace, who was born six months after he died, will be a flower girl.

The couple's engagement has delighted Rosie-Ann’s parents, Bob and Angie.

Bob said: 'I can't put into words, without getting overwhelmed and emotional, how I feel.'

Angie said: 'We feel we have gained a son.'

The wedding will finally give the Stone family a chance to have a happy celebration as in February last year, they were struck by tragedy again when Rosie-Ann's sister, Jennie, 28, was killed in a car crash in Fraisthorpe.

Rosie-Ann was involved in the fatal incident and prosecuted for causing death through careless driving, but was later unanimously acquitted by a jury at Hull Crown Court.

Rosie-Ann said she couldn't have gotten through the ordeal without her fiance's support. 

Happy day: The bride-to-be said her wedding to Liam will be special even though her siblings won't be there

She said: 'A lot of people ran a mile at what was the most difficult period of my life. I told Liam, "You don't have to put up with it." His response, was, "Put up with what?"'

Liam said he is honoured to be joining the Stone family.

'They're amazing and I love them,' he said. 'Nothing can stop them.'

Rosie-Ann said said their wedding day will be a joyous occasion even though her brother and sister will be absent.

She said: 'My dad will be buzzing when he's walking me down that aisle. I'll be wearing high heels, but Dad is quite short. I'll have to bend down so he can lift my veil!

'We're not going to be miserable, because the people who'd kick us the most would be Gregg and Jennie.'
