Dangerous paedophile: Mark Sleman, of Exeter, Devon, was jailed for nine years in 1994 for the kidnap and attempted rape of a ten-year-old girl

A dangerous paedophile who was released from prison early has gone on the run for a second time after absconding from his accommodation.

Mark Sleman, 42, of Exeter, Devon, was sent to prison for nine years in 1994 for the kidnap and attempted rape of a ten-year-old girl.

The English Defence League supporter, who has a personality disorder, was let out of prison early - but sent back to jail after breaching his licence terms by going on the run to visit a nightclub.

Then in 2008 Sleman was jailed for seven years for robbing a homeless man, but he was again released early - and again went on the run.

Now, the mother of the girl attacked by Sleman almost 20 years ago has spoken out to blast the probation service for being ‘not fit for purpose’.

The 52-year-old woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, told The Daily Telegraph: ‘It just beggars belief that Sleman has been allowed to go on the run again.

‘Surely after he breached the terms of his licence the first time he should never have been given another opportunity. (My daughter) is terrified that he is going to come looking for her or that he will attack another little girl.’

Sleman - who has been in prison for almost half of his life - attempted to rape the girl, a vicar’s daughter, after kidnapping her from a vicarage and tying her up in a caravan in 1994.

In 2010, ahead of his most recent release, Sleman claimed in a newspaper article that he reoffended when he was released on licence because he received insufficient support.

Proposal: Justice minister Chris Grayling has suggested a law change that would ensure child rapists must serve their full sentence before getting out of jail

Current rules state anyone serving a quantified sentence of more than a year must be released on licence from jail halfway through, reported The Daily Telegraph.

But justice minister Chris Grayling has suggested a law change that would ensure child rapists must serve their full sentence before leaving prison.

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘Serious offenders on licence who live in Approved Premises are subject to strict licence conditions and are carefully supervised by specially trained staff.

‘They must follow a structured regime, which includes an overnight curfew and can be recalled to prison if they breach them.'
