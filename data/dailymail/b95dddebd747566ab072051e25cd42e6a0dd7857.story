Back in the saddle: A fall from his bike revealed that Keith Ssewamala had a life-threatening condition that required him to have five operations in a year

A teenager who fell off his bike ended up needing five heart operations in a year - after his accident alerted doctors to a life-threatening condition.

Fourteen-year-old Keith Ssewamala,was just like any active teenager when he fell off his bike while playing with friends.

What should have been a routine tumble ended up with with Keith suffering chest pains and the discovery of an aneurysm on his heart.

While the aneurysm was successfully removed from his left ventricle, his health problems continued when he began coughing up blood and losing his eyesight.

Keith, from Brixton, south London, was then rushed to Evelina Children's Hospital after suffering a seizure.

Medics discovered he suffered from Takayashu arteritis - a condition that usually affects middle-aged women. It's so rare in young boys that the chances of getting it are just two million to one.

The condition causes inflammation that primarily damages the aorta and can lead to blockages or narrowed arteries, high blood pressure and eventually to 
heart failure or stroke.

As a result of his condition, Keith had to undergo five open heart surgeries and keyhole procedures in just a year.

He said: 'I wasn't expecting to have five open heart operations in a year - one was bad enough, but I knew I could get through it and they were making me better.

'Going through it all has made me all the more determined to do something with my life.

'They discovered I had the illness when I fell off the bike and say maybe it even triggered it.'

Keith, who lives with his mother Monica, 36, said he had a lot to thank his family and doctors for.

Now recovered, he has set up a foundation to 
help other children with heart problems.

Keith fell from his bike in 2008 and is still receiving treatment with injections every week at Great Ormond Street Hospital.

What should have been a routine tumble ended up with with Keith (with mother Monica) suffering chest pains and the discovery of an aneurysm on his heart. He then began coughing up blood and losing his eyesight

Keith was eventually diagnosed with Takayashu arteritis, which can cause high blood pressure and eventually to heart failure or stroke

He
said: 'I'm blessed to have parents who are so devoted to my happiness. I
realise that not all children have family and relatives like mine and 
I'm so grateful for all their support.

His mother said she was proud of how her son kept smiling throughout all the operations.

She said: 'In hospital, Keith would be getting out of bed and going to see other children - he wanted to see how they were and talk to them.

'He has been so brave since the fall from the bike and I think it was that fall that triggered the heart problem.

'Keith does have to take steroids now but his condition is still improving.

'He is so determined now to help other children so that is why we set up the foundation.'

'Evelina Children's Hospital has been fantastic in helping Keith battle his heart condition. The doctors and nurses are amazing every time we are there.

Consultant
paediatric cardiologist Professor Qureshi, who has been in charge of 
Keith's care, said: 'Keith has been diagnosed with Takayashu arteritis -
a rare form of heart disease that more frequently affects adult women.

As a result, Keith had to undergo five open heart surgeries and keyhole procedures in just a year.

'It involves inflammation in the walls of the largest arteries in the body, the aorta and its main branches.

'It has taken four years to diagnose this rare condition but his condition continues to improve.

Keith is now hoping to tour other schools and hospitals nationally to inspire others as well as pursuing his dream of becoming an actor.

He is now looking for someone to come forward to sponsor him to raise awareness around the country.

'The care I received at Evelina was 
wonderful, the doctors, nurses and play specialists are very funny and 
helpful. I want other children with heart conditions to have the right 
care and support too, which is why I helped set up the foundation.'

In Takayasu's arteritis, the aorta and other major arteries, including 
those leading to your head and kidneys, become inflamed.

Over time, the 
inflammation causes changes in these arteries, including thickening, 
narrowing and scarring.

The result is reduced blood flow to vital 
tissues and organs, which can lead to serious complications and even 
death. Sometimes arteries become abnormally dilated, leading to 
aneurysms that may rupture.

Just what causes the initial inflammation in Takayasu's arteritis isn't 
known. It's likely that Takayasu's arteritis is an autoimmune disease in
which your immune system malfunctions and attacks your own arteries as 
if they were foreign substances. The disease may be triggered by a virus
or other infection. 

The inflammation primarily damages the aorta — the large artery that 
carries blood from your heart to the rest of your body — and the aorta's
main branches.

The disease can lead to blockages or narrowed arteries or 
abnormally dilated arteries (aneurysms). It can also lead to arm or chest pain and high blood pressure and eventually to 
heart failure or stroke.

The goal of treatment is to relieve inflammation in the arteries and 
prevent potential complications.
