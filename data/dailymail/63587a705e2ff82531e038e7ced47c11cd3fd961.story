Dig out those umbrellas because Britain is set for a drenching tomorrow as temperatures in some areas drop to just 6C.

According to forecasters, parts of the country could see half a month's rain could fall in just 24 hours tomorrow.

The Met Office has already issued a yellow weather warning for persistent rain, and says some areas could get up to 60mm of rain.

Given the average rainfall for the whole of May is usually is 58.4mm that's an entire month's rain in one day.

Met Office forecaster Dan Williams said: 'We are expecting persistent rain in the south and west with a range of 20mm to 60mm.'

He added that some areas where the 
rain is at its worst could see 'exceptionally low' temperatures for May 
10C below the average maximum temperature for the month of 16C.

However towards the end of the week 
there will be spells of sunshine and showers, with temperatures climbing
to 15C or 16C in London on Thursday and Friday.

Trouble ahead: The Met Office has issued a warning of heavy rain on Tuesday

The maximum for tomorrow in London will be 12C.

The unseasonal weekend weather took a bizarre turn in Shropshire on Saturday when stunned residents spotted cloud formations that hung like bubbles in the sky above them.

The heavens above Telford filled with dark clouds which hung like they were fit to burst over the town.

Weathermen said the mammatus clouds - that appear as lobe-like clusters packed full of ice and rain - were created by thunderstorms that drenched much of the UK on Saturday.

Phil Spencer, a 39-year-old truck driver from Telford, was left baffled by the sudden change in the weather.

'I went to Morrisons and looked up and noticed all these weird and wonderful shapes in the sky,' he said.

'It was only there for five or 10 minutes and then just literally went as quickly as it came in.'

And as Mr Spencer noticed the strange events unfolding above him, he admitted others thought it may have been something even stranger.

'Quite a few people noticed and started saying 'It's aliens, it aliens' and you know shouting 'take me away', that kind of thing,' he said.

'Lucky for us if it was any visitors, they left without a fuss and took the rain with them.'

Matt Dobson, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, said towards the end of May we would see a return to more 'settled' weather.

He said: 'There is some rain on the way. Tuesday is looking like the wettest day of the week for southern parts of the country.

'There will be lots of rain moving from Devon and Cornwall and the south-west to Wales, with up to an inch or 25mm on Tuesday daytime.

'It's a lot for a day - a typical 
place in southern Britain would see around two inches of rain in a whole
month. Places could see half a month's rain in a day.'

But he said that predictions of a 
summer as wet as last year were premature. Time and time again it's been
shown these kinds of long range forecasts don't work', he said.

'Looking
forward though there are signs of slightly more settled weather towards
the end of May. It's still developmental work trying to predict a few 
months ahead.'

The weather has been so drab this 
year's wisteria flowers, which have heralded the arrival of summer in 
Britain for 150 years by blooming at Cambridge University, have not yet 
blossomed and are a month late.

The eye-catching bright purple climbing plant blooms on the side of the Master's Lodge at Christ College. But experts say it has has so-far failed to blossom because of unusually cold weather at the start of the year.

Be prepared: Carrying an umbrella for the rest of the month is advised, after forecasters release grim predictions for May

Eager college gardeners have 'hopefully' predicted the plant will finally flower this week but already fear the buds will be short-lived with a chilly May forecast.

Head gardener Steve Griffiths, 44, said: 'It is much later than normal. We would normally expect it to go into bloom in April and be in flower now so it is a month late.

'How long the flowers last once they have bloomed depends also depends on the weather. If we have a lot of wind and rain the flowers won't last - it's a bit like a natural barometer for the summer in this country, I suppose.

'The ideal conditions for the wisteria to last would be sunny days and rain in the evening. Because everything is behind this year we are really busy trying to catch up as well as doing everything we should be in this month.'

The wisteria normally blossoms in April and the flowers last for around two to four weeks - depending on conditions.

Weather boffins have dampened expectations by predicting temperatures will linger below average at around 13C for the rest of the month.

Wisteria, which is part of the pea family, thrives in temperatures of more than 20C.
