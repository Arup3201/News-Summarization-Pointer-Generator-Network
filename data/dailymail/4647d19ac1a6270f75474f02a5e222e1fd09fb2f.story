Elderly people may struggle to sleep as well as they did during their youth because they start to lose part of the brain that helps them ‘switch off’, scientists believe.

Researchers have identified a group of cells which blocks off conscious thoughts, allowing us to sleep.

They think these inhibitory neurons are gradually eroded as we age, leading to greater sleep problems in later life.

Falling asleep becomes more difficult with age because we lose the 'switch' that enables us to nod off

The
 scientists, from Harvard Medical School in the US, suggested the same 
process is seen in people with Alzheimer’s disease, who are particularly
 prone to disrupted sleep and night-time confusion.

Professor
 Clifford Saper, who led the research published in the journal Brain, 
said: ‘On average, a person in his 70s has about one hour less sleep per
 night than a person in his 20s.

‘The
 loss of these neurons with ageing and with Alzheimer’s disease may be 
an important reason why older individuals often face sleep disruptions.

‘These results may therefore lead to new methods to diminish sleep problems in the elderly.’

He
 added: ‘Sleep loss and sleep fragmentation is associated with a number 
of health issues, including cognitive dysfunction, increased blood 
pressure and vascular disease, and a tendency to develop type 2 
diabetes.

‘It now appears that loss of these neurons may be contributing to these various disorders as people age.’

Professor
 Saper’s team discovered a group of neurons – the ventrolateral preoptic
 nucleus – was functioning as a sleep switch in rats. They then found 
the same process was happening in humans. The cells turned off the 
brain’s arousal systems to enable the animals to fall asleep.

Professor
 Saper said: ‘Our experiments in animals showed that loss of these 
neurons produced profound insomnia, with animals sleeping only about 50 
per cent as much as normal and their remaining sleep being fragmented 
and disrupted.’ A group of inhibitor cells in the human brain is found 
in a similar location and has the same chemical make-up as that found in
 rats.

The researchers 
analysed data from 45 elderly people who had donated their brains to 
science and had agreed to wear movement sensors to monitor how well they
 slept, from the age of 65 until their death at an average age of 89.

Examining
 the brains, the scientists found people with fewer neurons in the 
‘sleep switch’ area  were more likely to have sleepless nights.

Professor Saper said: ‘The fewer the neurons, the more fragmented the sleep became.’

For those with the fewest inhibitor cells, less than 40 per cent of their time in bed was spent in extended periods of sleep.
