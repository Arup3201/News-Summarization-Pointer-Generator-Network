They have penalised British drivers for not carrying a warning triangle or a fluorescent safety vest.

Now French police have another weapon to wield against holidaymakers – a law insisting all motorists have a breathalyser kit in their cars.

The gadgets, designed so that drivers can test themselves to ensure they are under drink-drive limits, are the latest addition to a list of rules for driving on the other side of the Channel.

Bon voyage: Motorists travelling to France after July will be legally required to carry a breathalyser kit in the car

The measure, which will come into force in July, will apply to anyone travelling through France by car.

Critics however have cast doubt on the accuracy of the kits in being able to tell if a driver is over the limit. Others said it was simply another attempt to make money out of foreign drivers.

Motorists found with between 50mg and 
80mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood can be fined 135 euros (£112) and lose
six out of 12 points on their driving licence. Above that, a driver 
risks a fine of 4,500 euros (£3,744), losing their licence and being 
sent to prison for up to two years.

The French drink-driving limit of 50mg is much lower than in the UK where the limit is 80mg.

Motorists are being urged to carry at least two of the single-use breathalysers so that if they have checked themselves with one they can still show police they have a ready-to-use kit if stopped.

Police, however, will use their own breathalysers to carry out any roadside test.

Those drivers caught without a kit will face a fine of 11 euros (£9) but the French have said there will be a period of grace till November before police start issuing the penalties.

The breathalyser kits cost between around £1 and £2 and will be available at ferry and tunnel terminals for crossings to France, but motoring groups have warned that many drivers will still forget to pack them in their car.

Andrew Howard, the AA’s head of road safety, explained that it takes time for alcohol to be absorbed into the blood, so early readings could be misleading.

He said: ‘After you have had your last swig of alcohol, your reading will continue to rise for the next 40 minutes because it takes time for alcohol to go down into your stomach and be taken into the bloodstream.’

He added: 'Driving requirements in France are now quite complicated and the list of things you need to take is beginning to be quite a substantial extra charge to a holiday.'

Keith Peat of the Association of British Drivers said: ‘Some people will take the chance and not buy them, but many will simply not know about this latest requirement or just forget.

'The whole idea of self-testing sounds like nonsense. It seems like another money spinner for the very profitable road safety industry.'

Police are expected to carry out random checks on drivers crossing into France via Calais to ensure that they understand the latest drink-driving rules.

Anyone driving in France is already required to carry a warning triangle and a fluorescent safety vest to use in an emergency.

Additionally British motorists must display a GB plate and have their headlights adjusted to the right.

But even if drivers have the full list of equipment they can still be caught out by the complexity of the rules.

If a motorist carries the luminous vest in their boot rather than the main section of the car they can still be fined.

Drivers are not obliged to carry a spare set of lights, but if one of their bulbs goes and they do not have a replacement ready they can be fined.

A fire extinguisher and first aid kit could also be required in the case of an emergency so not to fall foul of a law about assisting in the event of an accident.

Last month, the French introduced a new law banning satellite navigation systems that show the location of speed cameras.

Those caught can be fined 1,500 euros even if the device is not in use.
