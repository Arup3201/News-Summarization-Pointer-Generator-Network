Wife of senator Glenn Lazarus, Tess has revealed she was dropped from the Palmer United Party after standing up to Clive Palmer

The wife of senator Glenn Lazarus has revealed she was dropped from the Palmer United Party after standing up to Clive Palmer.

Tess Lazarus, who was sacked as chief of staff for 'failing to comply', said her husband decided to quit because the pair did not tolerate 'bullying behaviour' but the Palmer United Party leader has denied these claims.

'I did make it clear to Clive that I was not happy with being bullied and spoken to using foul language,' she said, according to Sydney Morning Herald.

'I do not think that anyone should have to put up with this behaviour in the workplace. Glenn and I do not agree with bullying behaviour.'

But Mr Palmer has hit back, telling Fairfax Media: 'I've never bullied anyone.'

The claims follow after Mr Palmer slammed Mr Lazarus for being 'unprofessional' when the senator announced his resignation from the Palmer United Party via a text message.

The Queensland senator told Mr Palmer in a text message on Thursday night he was quitting to serve as an independent.

But in response to the departure, the PUP leader replied with one word: 'OK'.

The senator's decision came just hours after his wife Tess was sacked from her party role.

Senator Lazarus said the sacking was 'one of many things' forcing him to call it quits, but the key reason was Mr Palmer's dictatorial style and announcement of policies without consulting him.

'I have a different view of team work,' he said.

It leaves PUP with just one senator - Western Australia's Dio Wang - and means the government now has to negotiate separately with all eight Senate crossbenchers in order to get six of them onside to pass legislation.

Meanwhile, the bitter split by senator Lazarus has raised hopes in the Abbott government of getting it's higher education changes through the Senate next week.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the decision did not remove from the government the need to hold 'good faith' talks with crossbenchers.

Education Minister Christopher Pyne, who wants his university fee deregulation plan passed by the Senate next week, said Senator Wang had publicly indicated his support for the reform.

'So I at least hope, now that Glenn Lazarus is not the leader of the Palmer United Party in the Senate anymore, that Dio Wang might be free to support this bill next week,' Mr Pyne said.

Mr Pyne admitted he had never met Senator Lazarus.

Labor leader Bill Shorten said he respected Senator Lazarus and would work with him as an independent to defeat the university changes and other unpopular budget measures.

Government Senate leader Eric Abetz was due to contact Senators Wang and Lazarus on Friday to talk about their stances.

While not confirming his position, Senator Wang said he and Senator Lazarus had split over policy differences in recent party room meetings.

He said he remained loyal to Mr Palmer and believed the party had a strong future.

Tasmanian independent Jacqui Lambie, who quit PUP in November, said Senator Lazarus would stand up for uni students.

'I have a different view of team work. Given this, I felt it best that I resign from the party and pursue my Senate role as an independent Senator,' the statement read

'Glenn's resignation means that the average workers, the sick, our pensioners, the uni students and disabled will have even more protection in the Senate from this Liberal government, which wants to take away so much,' she said.

The higher education bill deregulates university fees and cuts funding for degrees by an average of 20 per cent.

It was rejected by the Senate in December, but the government has been working on amendments to get it through.

Independent senator Nick Xenophon says the departure of Senator Lazarus will make it more difficult for the government.

'Previously, government ministers could have dinner with Clive at the Wild Duck, or wherever they went, and now it's just that little bit more difficult,' Senator Xenophon said.

Mr Palmer accused Senator Lazarus of 'spitting the dummy', arguing that he had stepped in to help the former rugby league player when 'he was sort of washed up'.

Liberal Democratic Party senator David Leyonhjelm said there was a suspicion Mr Palmer had been taking an interest in Senator Lazarus' seat because he felt powerless in the lower house.

'That's probably not likely to happen now,' Senator Leyonhjelm said.

Senator Lazarus quit the party in a statement released on his Facebook page overnight.

His social media profiles were also updated to reflect his new status and removed any mention of the Palmer United Party

'I have today resigned from the Palmer United Party,' he said.

'This was a difficult decision.

'I have a different view of team work. Given this, I felt it best that I resign from the party and pursue my Senate role as an independent Senator.'

His social media profiles were also updated to remove any mention of the Palmer United Party. 

Mr Lazarus also said he is 'determined to do my best in representing, and being a voice for, the people of Queensland' during his time in the senate.

'I am deeply grateful to Clive Palmer for the opportunity to be involved in the party,' the statement read.

'I sincerely wish Clive and his family all the very best for the future.

'I will miss working with my esteemed colleague Senator Dio Wang.

The resignation is another blow for PUP leader, who has seen his political power diminish since he arrived in Canberra

Mr Lazarus's resignation is another blow for Clive Palmer's party, after Tasmanian Senator Jacqui Lambie quit last November.

It also further weakens the Palmer United Party's voting power, which prior to Ms Lambie's resignation had the power to block legislation on its own.
