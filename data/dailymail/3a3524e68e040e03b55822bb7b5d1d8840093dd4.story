Although George Travis' beloved wife of nearly 50 years passed away last year, she is never far from his side.

Every day, the 88-year-old widower from Shreveport, Louisiana eats his breakfast at the same restaurant and places a photograph of his wife, Billy Mae, on the counter.

'I bring her with me everywhere I go,' he told KSLA. 'I never go anywhere without my precious wife.'

Speaking to the channel after other customers highlighted his story, he said that he was divorced and struggling to maintain a relationship with his two children when he met Billy Mae 50 years ago.

In love: When asked what he misses about Billy Mae, who died last year, Travis said 'everything'

Feeling low about his failed family life, he asked a friend to set him up on a blind date for a Lions Club Convention in Alexandria - and he was taken aback when she walked in.

'How fortunate I was to have a date as beautiful as she was,' he told the channel. 'When I took her to the Lions Club convention that day I felt very important. She made me feel that way.'

The couple later married and spent five happy decades together, he said. 

They worked side-by-side and successfully ran Travis Shoe Stores in Shreveport for many years, according to her obituary. They later expanded business into Texas.

'I don't believe that she ever made me feel like I was not wanted or not needed,' he said. 'I always felt important.'

But in July 2013, he was by her side to watch her take her final breaths and pass away following an illness. She was 83.

'It was the hardest thing that's ever happened to me,' he said.

He said he now looks forward to the time they can be together again.

'I miss being able to put my arms around her,' he told KSLA.

His story was shared by other customers who started noticing him at the counter with his wife's picture each morning. Some have even offered to pay for his meal.

Loved: Travis, who has four great-grandchildren, said she always made him feel important and loved

Missed: He is pictured beside his wife's grave and said he looks forward to being reunited with her one day

The channel reported that Mr Travis suffered a heart attack last week but is doing well and hopes to return to the restaurant with Billy Mae's picture soon. 

His story comes after a photo of another widower dining alone at an In-N-Out Burger in October with just a picture of his late wife was shared across the internet. 

The man, John Silva, told MailOnline that he visits the grave of his wife, Hilda, nearly every day. She passed away in 2009.

'I was a lucky man to marry the girl I loved,' he said.
