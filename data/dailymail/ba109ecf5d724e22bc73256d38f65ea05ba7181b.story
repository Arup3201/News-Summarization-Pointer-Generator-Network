'I'm delighted to have got the win,' Anderson told www.pdc.tv. 'I was looking at a draw going into the final leg but I managed to pinch it and it's a bonus for me.

'Maybe it was a bit of a steal in the end but that wasn't the real Phil tonight and I took advantage. Hopefully I will play better next week but this is a good start.'

Van Gerwen averaged 107.72 and finished off with a 145 checkout against the Belgian, who made his Premier League debut.

'To win 7-3 in my first game of the Premier League is very good and I played quite well,' said van Gerwen. 'I didn't expect to play this well but I'm very happy with my form, and I finished well at the right time,

'It was Kim's debut and it was difficult for him, but when you're on this stage you need to be prepared for everything. He's a good player and he'll be back.

'The crowd were amazing and I had goosebumps. That makes you feel incredible and it means a lot to me, and I think it made me play better.' 

Adrian Lewis thrashed reigning champion Raymond van Berneveld 7-1 on opening night in Leeds

Lewis averaged 113.80 - his highest in a televised game and the fourth highest in the history of the Premier League - on his way to crushing the reigning champion.

When I lost to Raymond in the World Championship I missed too many doubles and let him in, and I've been thinking about that game every day since,' admitted Lewis.

'I knew I was in great form and I've shown it tonight, and a 7-1 win for me is a great start to the season. There was a quality atmosphere from the moment we walked out, and it gave me a great feeling.'

'It feels like a win for me to be honest,' Bunting said after making his Premier League debut. 'James is a fantastic player and I always know I'm in for a tough match when I play him, so I'm happy to get a point on the board.

'The venue was absolutely amazing - the biggest crowd I've ever played in front of before was about 4,000 in Sydney, so it's fantastic to play in front of a crowd like that and I can't wait for the rest of the Premier League now.'
