A Stony Brook  University student says she was forced to personally prosecute the man she claims sexually assaulted her.

Now Sarah Tubbs, 22, is suing the school as well as her alleged attacker for Title XI violations, which prevent discrimination of gender at federally funded schools. 

Stony Brook is part of the State University of New York system. 

Filed last month in White Plains federal court, Tubbs' suit seeks monetary damages and a court order dissolving the school's practice of requiring sexual assault victims to 'prosecute their won cases and to cross-examine and be cross-examined by their assailants.'

Which, as The Journal News reports, is exactly what she Tubbs says happened to her.

Tubbs says the attack happened early on January 26, 2014, after a drinking game at a campus party. 

She went with the unnamed attacker to his dorm with the intention of having sex, but changed her mind.

She tired to physically resist and blacked out from the intoxication.

Her assailant then forced oral sex on her, penetrated her with his digits, and tried to have vaginal intercourse.

As the alleged assailant has not been criminally charged his name has not been released, and he failed to respond to interview request from The Journal News. 

'I froze and there were parts of the night where I couldn't fight because it's not an option,' Tubbs said. 

She reported the assault to campus police two days later. They directed her to have a rape examination at Stony Brooky University Hospital. 

Two weeks later with the exam done, she filed a formal complaint, but the officer told her that her case wasn't viable 'because she did not scream 'No' or violently fight back.'

She did not go to the District Attorney, fearing they'd tell her the same thing. 

But she did go after university disciplinary action only to be told one week before the hearing that she would have to be the one to prosecute her alleged attacker. 

That meant making exhibits, penning and opening statement, and putting together witness testimony.

Tubbs said the school's campus police told her she didn't have a case as she failed to say 'no' or 'violently fight back'

She spent the five-hour hearing separated from her alleged attacker by nothing but a paper screen, without any form of security present. 

'I would say the hardest part was hearing his voice because it's the voice I hear in my flashbacks,' she said. 'One of my biggest concerns ... was that he would get aggressive and retaliate.'

The accused claimed everything was consensual and was found not to be responsible for any wrongdoing. 

She appealed based on the Stony Brook's sexual misconduct policy being clear that a person cannot give consent if impaired by alcohol or unconscious. 

Stony Brook is just one of 94 colleges nationally with pending Title IX investigations regarding sexual violence.

Tubbs has since graduated and now studies for a master's in social work at Hunter College. 

'I don't think it's the rape that makes the person a victim,' she said. 'I think it's the systemic failure that makes someone from a survivor to a victim. ... I can honestly say I won't stop fighting until those systems change.'
