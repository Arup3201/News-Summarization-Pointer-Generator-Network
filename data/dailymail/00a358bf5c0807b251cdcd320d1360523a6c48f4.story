Allowing 16-year-olds to vote on Scottish independence would make a lower voting age ‘inevitable’ across Britain, David Cameron was warned yesterday.

The Prime Minister is poised to extend a referendum on the issue to 16 and 17-year-old Scots as a concession to Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond at a meeting on Monday.

But a former Tory Scottish secretary said the precedent would make it ‘impossible’ to prevent youngsters voting in future general elections, and ‘bring politics into our schools’.

Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, who served in John Major’s government, claimed Mr Salmond was trying to ‘bully’ the Prime Minister into allowing a major constitutional change in a deal sealed ‘over whisky and sandwiches in Edinburgh’.

He said: ‘Once that has happened it will be impossible to argue that 16-year-olds should not have the vote in all elections. You can’t pick and choose.

‘If you are going to make this step, which is a huge step . . . then a Bill should be brought before the House of Commons and people will then have an opportunity to consider the arguments properly and make amendments.’

His intervention came as Labour MP 
Natascha Engel said she hoped lowering the voting age for the referendum
in October 2014 would open the door to extending it.

‘The time has come for it,’ she said. 
‘Attitudes have shifted. We’ve been campaigning for a very long time to 
lower the voting age to 16 and this is a very exciting opportunity 
that’s being presented in Scotland to demonstrate that when you do give 
the vote to 16-year-olds, the sky doesn’t fall in.’

Lord Forsyth said her comments suggested the Scottish referendum was a ‘backdoor way’ of lowering the voting age before the 2015 general election, but she insisted this would not happen as it requires a change in the law.

The idea was last proposed in 1999 and was defeated by a majority of more than 400. However, it is the official policy of the Liberal Democrats and is supported by Labour leader Ed Miliband.

Lord Forsyth said: ‘What is happening here is that Alex Salmond is attempting to bully the Prime Minister into agreeing to having 16-year-olds voting in the Scottish referendum in return for having a single question on independence.

‘The referendum will be towards the end of 2014. Are we going to say to these people on the register, “I know you got to vote six months ago, but you’re not going to be able to vote in the general election?”’

Downing Street sources yesterday played down fears about a change in the voting age in Britain, saying any legislation would apply only to the referendum.
