An American cyclist was knocked to the ground when when a passenger in a taxi ahead of him opens the car door, which he hits  with a thundering bang.

Captured on film by the biker, Dan Connor, the footage shows him narrowly avoiding two pedestrians crossing the road and shouts 'look out!' while cycling towards Union Square, New York.

Unfortunately for the cyclist there is a further obstacle ahead which results in a stomach-churning collision and an injured knee. 

Near miss: Cyclist Dan Connor just about manages to avoid these pedestrians

Crash: Further up the street he is travelling quickly in the bike lane when the taxi door opens

Mr Connor is riding along in the cycling lane when a taxi door opens right in front of him - and he crashes into the car door.

Immediately after the collision a woman can be heard saying: 'Ohh no are you OK?'

Mr Connor, who is groaning and sounds like he is in significant pain then replies from the ground: 'I don't know yet.'

Crash scene: Mr Connor's bike is scattered on the ground after the impact

A passerby then intervenes and asks what's happened.

The cyclist then says: 'She opened the door and hit me in the bike lane. And that's why I don't ride in bike lanes!'

An observer then advises the injured man to 'stay down'  when Mr Connor says that his knee 'feels weird'.

Sore: Mr Connor looks up from the ground as the taxi passengers and passers-by ask him if he is OK

Apology: The girl in the pink top apologises to Mr Connor and says she 'didn't see him coming'

The taxi driver tells the girl off for opening the door in the cab lane but she says that she didn't hear him

Moments later Mr Connor moves himself onto the footpath and he says he feels OK. 

The girl who opened the taxi door apologies and says, 'I'm really sorry I didn't see you coming.' 

The taxi driver claims he warned her about the cyclist and the girl says that she didn't hear him.
