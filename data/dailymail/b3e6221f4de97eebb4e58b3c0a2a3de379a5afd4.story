Fans of the beautiful game paid to watch former stars in the 'Battle of the South Americans' between Brazil and Argentina at the weekend. 

One of the greats on display for the showpiece occasion between the footballing giants was Claudio Caniggia, who won 50 caps for Argentina.

However the Caniggia on show - despite wearing his customary number number 7 shift - was not the skilful winger who netted 16 goals in the famous blue and white shirt. 

In fact, it was fellow Argentine Daniel Cordone, who was once declared the Premier League's worst transfer after an ill-fated spell at Newcastle United. 

The number 7 on show at the 'Masters' match was not Claudio Caniggia but Newcastle flop Daniel Cordone

Caniggia, a close friend of Diego Maradona, won 50 caps for his country and scored 16 goals 

Cordone enjoyed a dismal time at Newcastle, playing only 21 times - he has never represented his country 

After the game, organisers insisted Cordone was Caniggia and the event's promoter Andre de Paula said: 'This is the Caniggia, the real Caniggia. There is no other Caniggia.' 

However, suspicions were raised when Cordone ran straight to the dressing room at the final whistle and refused to speak to the media. 

And his guise was eventually caught out when it emerged the former Newcastle striker has a visible tattoo on his right-arm, unlike Caniggia. 

One fan told local media that he was so angry at the 'fake' Caniggia that he left the stadium early, while another added: 'I am very disappointed. I am an admirer of Argentine football and I wanted to see the match, and get autographs.' 

The match finished 3-3, with Esteban Fuertes and Ruggeri (2) on the scoresheet for Argentina. Petkovic, Beto and Souza netted for Brazil.  

Cordone tried to fool the spectators in to thinking he was the former Argentina player - he is pictured here tackling Brazil's former player Adilio during the match at Dunas stadium in Natal

Cordone even took on free-kick responsibility under the guise of Argentina great Caniggia during the game

The forward began his footballing career at Velez Sarsfield in his home country, which earned him a move to Newcastle United for a fee of £500,000 in 2000. 

However, in a disappointing spell in the North East he played only 21 times and scored three goals against Derby, Tottenham and Bradford in the League Cup. 

His time at Newcastle earned him the unfortunate title of the worst transfer in Premier League history. 

After leaving Newcastle, he played for a string of teams in Argentina. He was never capped by his country.

The skilful winger started his career at River Plate, before moving to European giants Roma and Benfica. 

He then joined River Plate's bitter rivals, Boca Juniors before signing for Dundee and then Rangers in Scotland, where he enjoyed cult-hero status. 

He won 50 caps for Argentina, scoring 16 goals. 

He is a close friend of Argentina's greatest ever-player Diego Maradona and had a reputation for enjoying the high-life. He was banned for 13 months in 1993 after testing positive for cocaine.
