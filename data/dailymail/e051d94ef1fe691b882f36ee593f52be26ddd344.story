Cristiano Ronaldo has posted a picture on social networking site Twitter of him relaxing in a ball-pit with his four-year-old son Cristiano Ronaldo jr. 

The picture, followed by the caption 'Fun time with my kid last night,' showed Ronaldo's lighter side as he laid in the ball pit at the bottom of a play area's slide.

The current holder of the FIFA Ballon d'Or, who helped his Real Madrid side get off to a winning start in La Liga on Monday night against Cordoba, posted the picture to his 29.3 million Twitter followers on Thursday afternoon.

Ronaldo scored a 90th minute goal to secure Madrid's 2-0 win, after Karim Benzema had opening the scoring with a first-half header. 

Madrid travel to Real Sociedad on Sunday evening, attempting to continue their 100% win record at the start of the 2014/15 season.
