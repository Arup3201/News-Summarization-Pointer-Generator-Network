Controversy: Lord Howell of Guildford said fracking could go ahead in the North East because it was inhabitable

A Tory peer provoked a storm of criticism yesterday by suggesting fracking should be concentrated in the North East of England because it is ‘desolate’.

Lord Howell, the father-in-law of Chancellor George Osborne, said ‘beautiful rural areas’ further south should be spared the disruption caused by the controversial method of shale gas extraction.

The peer, who as David Howell was Energy Secretary under Margaret Thatcher and long-serving MP for Guildford in Surrey, claimed that the North East was so sparsely populated that fracking could take place without any impact on the environment or local people.

His comments in the House of Lords drew gasps of astonishment – and immediate condemnation.

Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby tweeted: ‘North east England very beautiful, rugged, welcoming, inspiring, historic, advancing, not “desolate” as was said in House of Lords today.’

Labour accused Lord Howell, 77, whose daughter Frances is married to the Chancellor, of wishing to protect Tory heartlands in the South East while condemning the North to shale gas drilling.

The peer later apologised for ‘any offence caused’ but his comments are embarrassing for the Conservatives, who must gain seats in the North to have any hope of winning the 2015 election.

Last night Tories distanced themselves from Lord Howell, pointing out that he was no longer connected to the Government after stepping down in April as  William Hague’s adviser on energy.

His intervention came as villagers entered the sixth day of protests against fracking in the West Sussex countryside. Some 23 people have so far been arrested in Balcombe, which has been earmarked for exploratory drilling by fracking company Cuadrilla.

Police outnumbered the campaigners 
yesterday morning, with officers forming a human shield to enable 
delivery lorries to enter the site unhindered by a group of 50 
protesters who included Mick Jagger’s ex-wife Bianca Jagger.

Fracking involves pumping liquid at high pressure deep underground to split shale rock and release gas for use as fuel.

Lord Howell told the Lords that it 
would be a ‘mistake to think of and discuss fracking in terms of the 
whole of the United Kingdom in one go’.

‘There obviously are, in beautiful 
rural areas, worries about not just the drilling and the fracking, which
I think are exaggerated, but about the trucks, and the delivery, and 
the roads, and the disturbance,’ he said. ‘And those are quite justified
worries.

‘But there are large and uninhabited 
and desolate areas. Certainly in part of the North East where there’s 
plenty of room for fracking, well away from anybody’s residence, where 
we could conduct without any kind of threat to the rural environment.’

Despite stunned exclamations from 
peers, Lord Howell continued unperturbed, saying that a distinction 
‘should be made between one area and another, rather than lump them all 
together’.

Labour’s Lord Beecham, former leader 
of Newcastle City Council, said: ‘Neville Chamberlain spoke of pre-war 
Czechoslovakia as “a far away country of which we know nothing”. Lord 
Howell clearly has a similar view on the North East and his comments 
once again highlight the Tories’ problem with the North.’

While Northumberland is England’s 
least densely populated county, the North East, far from being desolate,
contains a wealth of spectacular scenery including the north Pennines, 
the Cheviots and a national park, as well as two World Heritage sites: 
Hadrian’s Wall and Durham Cathedral.

David Skelton, director of Renewal, 
which campaigns to broaden the appeal of the Conservative Party, said: 
‘The North East boasts some of the finest landscapes in the country. I’d
be delighted to give Lord Howell a tour.

‘The choice over where fracking should take place should be taken by local communities.’

Jude Leitch, of Northumberland 
Tourism, said: ‘He’s probably never been up here in his life.’ Last 
night Lord Howell was forced into a humiliating climbdown.

In a statement he said: ‘I apologise 
for any offence caused. I certainly did not intend to suggest that the 
North East is desolate.

‘There are parts of the country that 
are less densely inhabited than others. That includes parts of the North
East but also other areas in the South of England as well.’

Lord Howell (pictured right) was born in 1936 and educated at Eton.

From 1954 to 1956 he was in the Armed Forces in the 2nd Battalion Coldstream Guards. He studied Economics at King’s College, Cambridge, graduating in 1959.

His first job was with HM Treasury from 1959-60 as part of the Treasury Economic Section. He then spent four years as a leader writer for the Daily Telegraph until 1964.

Lord Howell has written a number of books, including The Edge of Now, about the challenges of democracy in the digital age, published in 2000.

After an unsuccessful bid for Dudley at the 1964 General Election, he became director of the Conservative Political Centre. Two years later, he eventually won the seat of Guildford, representing the Surrey county town until 1997, when he was made a life peer.

Lord Howell is the former Secretary of State for Energy, and later for Transport in Margaret Thatcher’s first Cabinet (1979-83). He was Minister of State in Northern Ireland (1972-74) and has held several other government posts. He was chairman of the International Energy Agency ministerial meeting in May 1979.

From 1987-97, he was chairman of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee.

From May 2010 to Sept 2012, Lord Howell was appointed Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, with responsibility for international energy policy.

After stepping down from the post in September 2012, he was appointed as personal adviser to Foreign Secretary William Hague on energy and resource security.

According to the Conservative Party website, Lord Howell is credited by several authorities with having invented the idea of privatisation in the late 1960s.

He is also Chairman of the British Institute of Energy Economics, which counts Shell and BP among its members.

Lord Howell is married with two daughters and one son. One of his daughters, Frances, is married to George Osborne, the Chancellor.
