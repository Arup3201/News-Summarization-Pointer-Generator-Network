A couple have told of their shock after their two-year-old daughter, who they thought just had a cold, was diagnosed with leukaemia.

Mandy and Bob Holmes became concerned when Jessica developed a cold which showed no sign of improving after a few days.

Mr Holmes, 43, took her to Royal Lancaster Infirmary's A&E on September 29 to get checked over and was sent home with antibiotics for a chest infection.

Jessica Holmes, two, was diagnosed with leukaemia after she developed a cold which failed to clear up

However, three days later, Jessica still showed no improvement - and deteriorated to a point where she was not eating or drinking and was sleeping 23 hours a day – so she was taken back to hospital.

Doctors carried out chest X-rays and told the family Jessica had pneumonia.

But, after getting the results of blood tests, on October 3 doctors gave Jessica a blood transfusion and rushed her to Royal Manchester Children's Hospital.

Mrs Holmes, 40, said: ‘At this point, we had no idea what was wrong - at worst I thought it would be asthma or diabetes.

‘They put us on a ward where there were all these children with no hair and I thought it was just while they were waiting to put us on a different ward.

‘Then a Macmillan nurse came and introduced herself to us but I could not understand why we needed a Macmillan nurse.’

Jessica was transferred from Royal Lancaster Infirmary to Royal Manchester Children's Hospital where her parents say they were taken to a cancer ward before being told she had leukaemia

A consultant arrived shortly after and asked Mr and Mrs Holmes to come for a private chat in his office.

They were told Jessica has acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, a cancer of the white blood cells.

Mrs Holmes said: ‘It was just awful. It was even more upsetting than when my father died - and that's saying something.

‘But I was so overwhelmed by the shock it felt like I had been switched off - I went completely numb and nothing was registering.

‘The doctor was going on-and-on and I couldn't hear a single word he was saying.

‘I was just looking into this forest landscape painting that was hung on the wall.

‘The doctor could have been repeating “I'm a monkey, I'm a monkey” and I wouldn't have noticed.’

Jessica spent a month in hospital after her diagnosis and had intensive chemotherapy and steroid treatment as well as five blood transfusions.

After returning home briefly, she went back for more chemotherapy and is now going back to hospital twice a week.

Mother-of-five Mrs Holmes said: ‘We just take each day at a time and try not to look too far ahead.’

Mrs Holmes said: 'They put us on a ward where there were all these children with no hair and I thought it was just while they were waiting to put us on a different ward.'

Mr Holmes, an HGV driver, said: ‘Jessica is my first child and when she was born, I was ecstatic as she is all I ever wanted.

‘When we found out she had leukaemia, I went to pieces. But everybody has got behind us and without the support we have had, we would have cracked long ago.’

Jessica is now undergoing intensive treatment which will continue for at least two years and she has already lost her curly hair following chemotherapy.

Mrs Holmes, who has her own business called Mandy's Home Help, said: ‘You never expect something like this to suddenly happen to your child and when it does, it knocks you sideways.

‘When the specialist mentioned the word “leukaemia”, my first terrified thought was that Jessica was going to die.

‘When I was at school, a girl I knew got leukaemia and she died and I instantly thought of that and it frightened me.

‘But luckily, medical advances have been made since then and we have to take each day at a time and hope that Jessica's leukaemia will be cured.’

Mr and Mrs Holmes, who live in Preston, Lancashire, revealed that they couldn't have coped without the support of friends, family and the community who have rallied around and raised funds to help them through the financial difficulties that their situation has suddenly landed them with.

Mrs Holmes, who has children Carlyanne, 21, Sophie, 20, Lauren, 16, and Dylan, 12, from a previous marriage, said: ‘There are lots of extra costs when your child has cancer but people in the community have been so kind and we have set up the Jessica Holmes Family Fund and have had around £400 in donations.

‘The Royal Bank of Scotland branch in Garstang have been fundraising and lots of other people have been so generous by giving us food and money to help us through a difficult time.

‘We cannot claim any financial support as you have to wait for three months after diagnosis. But once we can claim, I am planning to raise to raise money for the Ronald McDonald house where we stayed and for CLIC Sargent, the children's cancer charity.’

A spokesman for Central Manchester University Hospitals said: 'We are sorry to hear that the family have concerns about their transfer to Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital.

'We would urge them to speak to a member of ward staff or contact our PALS department and we would be happy to look into any issues that they may have.'

Leukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells.

Acute leukaemia means it progresses rapidly and aggressively.

Acute leukaemia is classified according to the type of white blood cells that are affected - lymphoblastic leukaemia is cancer of the lymphocytes which are white blood cells used to fight viral infections.

Symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia include pale skin, tiredness, breathlessness and having repeated infections.

About 7,600 people are diagnosed with leukaemia every year in the UK - about 650 of these have acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.

It is the most common type of cancer to affect children and one in every 2,000 will develop it.

In about 85 per cent of cases, it affects children under the age of 15 - the majority of cases develop in two to five-year-olds.

The outlook for children with the disease is usually good - almost all children will achieve a period of remission and 85 per cent will be completely cured.

Only 40 per cent of adults with the condition are completely cured.
