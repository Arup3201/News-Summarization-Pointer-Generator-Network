Dover Athletic vs Crystal Palace, 1pm Sunday (BT Sport)

Accrington or Yeovil vs Manchester United, 3.30 Sunday (BT Sport)

Arsenal vs Hull, 5.30 Sunday (BBC)

Wimbledon vs Liverpool Monday 7.55 (BBC)

Everton vs West Ham, Tuesday 7.45 (BT Sport)

The BBC have chosen the match between AFC Wimbledon and Liverpool for their third round live coverage. 

The other Beeb game will be Arsenal vs Hull, a repeat of last season's FA Cup final.

The BT Sport choices are Dover Athletic vs Crystal Palace, Accrington or Yeovil vs Manchester United and Everton vs West Ham. 

The decisions are set to cause travel chaos for fans. Liverpool's trip to Wimbledon, rearranged for 7.55pm on Monday 5 January, will finish at around 10pm, but the last train from London to Liverpool leaves at 9.10pm.

Accrington Stanley and Yeovil Town will battle it out to see who will meet Manchester United 

Manchester United's trip to Accrington Stanley or Yeovil Town will be shown live on BT Sport.

It will be the 43rd time in a row that United's tie will be shown, a record going back 10 years to a 0-0 draw with Exeter.

Similarly, West Ham fans who travel to Everton for their 7.45pm kick off on Tuesday 6 January would have to leave before half-time to catch the last train back to London, set to depart Liverpool at 8.48pm.

Each club involved in a live game will receive an FA TV fee of £144,000 with the winning club picking up £67,500 from The FA Prize Fund. 

Despite only five matches being shown live on TV, at least half of the 32 games are likely to be moved away from the Saturday, leaving 16 matches or less on the originally scheduled date of 3 January.

With every Premier League team in action on New Years Day, just 48 hours earlier, they have all been given permission to move their FA Cup ties later in the weekend. 

Mark Cole, lead executive of football on BBC Sport, said: ‘Saturday is a chance for any of the 32 teams in action to grab the spotlight on Match of the Day, while we've got six hours of coverage on Sunday to chart the progress of the 14 games.’

Gary Lineker took to Twitter to express his excitement at the selections. 'Looking forward to hosting the Arsenal v Hull & AFC Wimbledon v Liverpool FA Cup 3rd round ties. Great to have it back on the BBC,' he wrote.

Blyth Spartans were one of the stories of the second round, but their tie against Birmingham will not be shown

Dover Athletic are the only non-league club who will feature on live TV over the long weekend of football, with Blyth Spartans' home tie against Championship side Birmingham overlooked, despite a five-division gap between the two sides.

However, that is one more than last year, when not a single club from below the Championship made the selection of televised matches. For the second time in a row, seven of the 10 clubs shown will be from the Premier League, including two all top-flight ties.

And there is more of a chance for the romance of the cup to shine through this time around, with the three remaining teams all from the third tier or below.
