The third stage of the 101st Tour de France began in Cambridge on Monday, with Italian Vincenzo Nibali in the yellow jersey for the final day on UK soil.

The Tour returns to France on Monday evening after two stages in Yorkshire - watched by millions of people; five million was Tour director Christian Prudhomme's estimate - and the 155-kilometre route from Cambridge to central London.

The stage is expected to end in a sprint on The Mall, but without Mark Cavendish after he suffered a shoulder injury on day one in Harrogate and withdrew from the race.

The peloton paraded through Cambridge's tight streets around the university's world-renowned colleges, before heading east into Essex.
