With Fernando Torres now confirmed to be playing his fifth campaign in a Chelsea shirt by Jose Mourinho, the £50million man is battling to finally prove his worth.

Chelsea's No 9 was in competition with Diego Costa as Jose Mourinho's squad enjoyed a light-hearted game of head tennis in training following their 2-1 win over Vitesse on Wednesday night.

New No 19 Costa is expected to be first choice to lead the line at Stamford Bridge this season with Torres not carrying the 'No 1 striker' tag for the first time in his Chelsea career.

And Blues supporters will hope that can give their big money flop a boost, with Chelsea likely to need at least two forwards firing for a title charge.

For now, he has Jose Mourinho to impress - and although it seemed Costa was coming out on top Torres looked comfortable as he and the rest of the squad warm up for the new season.

Eden Hazard was also on show - but with the ball at his feet - as the Belgian playmaker enjoyed his first day back in full training.

And Didier Drogba also enjoyed a kick around as he looks to prove his fitness for the Blues next pre season fixture against Werder Bremen on Sunday.

At the end of the session doping control testers were onsite to make sure everything was as it should in typical tests happening for all football clubs in their preparations for the new campaign.
