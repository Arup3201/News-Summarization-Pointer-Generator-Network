The black designer silk and lace lingerie I bought for my honeymoon four years ago cost almost as much as the wedding.

As far as I’m concerned, it’s worth every penny, because my husband still loves it.

Despite being busy parents of a lively two-year-old boy, my husband, Tom, still fancies the pants off me and, if anything, that side of our relationship is better than before we had our son.

Our secret? I maintain it’s the fact that he wasn’t by my side at our son’s birth.

And so does Tom — whenever he hears about celebrities like Robbie Williams making a song and dance about being at their wives’ side during labour, he declares: ‘That’s it for them. It’s all over for their sex lives. No man should have to watch his wife give birth. It is just plain wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.’

Far from being cross at his somewhat old-fashioned attitude, I agree with him. Not only do I believe men should not be there during the actual birth, I don’t think they should even enter the birthing suite.

Like most modern women, I used to think very differently. I had always assumed that, when I gave birth, my husband would be there at my side. When I discovered I was pregnant in January 2012, I’d already been through two miscarriages. So, for the first couple of months, I was terribly cautious about making any plans for the birth. My fears were only allayed after my 20-week scan, when we were told we were expecting a healthy boy.

I began preparing for the baby’s arrival, but I guess alarm bells should have started ringing when Tom refused to go to our antenatal classes, saying he had no intention of sitting around, listening to a bunch of women talk about cracked nipples. He stuck to his guns, even when I told him how humiliating it was being the only woman there without her other half.

So it was with trepidation that I approached the issue of him being my birthing partner. I explained that I really needed him by my side, that as I loved him more than anyone else, and he was responsible for my pregnant state, he simply had to hold my hand.

I even said he could stay up at the ‘head-end’. He wouldn’t have to cut the cord, or ‘look downstairs’, as it were. But it was to no avail. The answer was the same: a straight, firm, and resolute ‘no’.

The man I’ve loved for 13 years told me again and again there was absolutely no way he was having anything to do with the birth: he’d ‘done his bit’ and, anyway, he couldn’t stand the sight of blood.

Maybe I should have seen it coming. Tom is from Fiji and belongs to a line of traditional, testosterone-fuelled men, who think the act of fertilisation is pretty much the beginning and end of their role when it comes to producing offspring.

He is much older than me — 67 to my 43 — and is very traditional. He does the ‘manly’ things, like fixing our cars and mowing the lawn.

But to him, women’s stuff is women’s stuff. I cried, I screamed and even refused to speak to him for a week. Finally, I sat down and, through sobs, begged him to change his mind.

It was then he revealed the truth. ‘I can’t,’ he said. ‘It’ll put me off sex with you for ever.’ His admission stopped me in my tracks. In that moment, I gave up the fight.

I couldn’t bear for him not to see me in the same way. I didn’t want to become nothing more to him than a saggy-bellied, milk-soaked, mummy-type, who had lost her sex appeal.Despite my disappointment, my mum and best friend Anna, a nurse, kindly stepped in and became my birthing partners.

Rachel says giving birth was an 'absolute nightmare of gore and horror'

With hindsight, it was the best outcome for us all.

The birth, in October 2012, was an absolute nightmare of gore and horror. I have never felt pain like it. Labour lasted 12 hours. I pushed for an hour-and-a-half, before the nurse told me my son’s head was stuck and I was whisked off to theatre for a forceps delivery.

All the while, Tom, who had driven us all to The Great Western Hospital in Wiltshire, at 6am, was sitting patiently outside my hospital room. He had, at least, agreed to stay, rather than go home.

Though that didn’t last — he popped his head around the door as the anaesthetist was preparing my spinal block to announce he was heading off to the pub. ‘Do text if you need me,’ he said. Far from being furious, I was relieved. I felt exposed and vulnerable. Him seeing me like this would have made things even worse.

At one point, I was violently sick all over my best friend; my hair was stuck to my head with sweat; I was angry, in pain, and had my legs stuck in stirrups.

I felt embarrassed. I didn’t want my husband to have the memory of his ‘top totty’ (his nickname for me) behaving like a crazed farmyard animal.

There has to be a reason why, for years, men paced up and down the corridors, smoking cigarettes, outside bedrooms and hospital wards across the country. This was accepted behaviour for a reason — so a man could look at his wife as a mother, but also as the sexual being he fell in love with.

At a recent girly get-together, my friend Samantha confessed that, in the two weeks since she had her second baby, her husband has kept reminding her to do her pelvic floor exercises. Apparently, having seen the head appear, he is fretting sex will never feel the same.

Another friend confided that her husband had found their daughter’s birth traumatising. The first few times they’d attempted to make love, he found it impossible.

A few months ago, I got a call from an old university friend. We used to be really close, so I wasn’t entirely surprised when he asked if he could tell me something he could never tell his wife. He went on to explain that, after watching her give birth, he’d been incapable of forgetting the memory.

He seriously thought that he had PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder).

As he went on, I began to feel really sorry for him and his wife. I knew she would be desperate to feel like a woman again, but he said that he just felt queasy at the thought of them resuming their former marital relationship.

Meanwhile, I know for sure that my husband’s view of me hasn’t changed at all.

Although it took me a while to feel like a woman again, our love life became better than ever, as my husband candidly said he fancied me even more, thanks to all my extra curves.

Every couple’s sex life takes a while to adjust after the birth of a child. But what’s rarely alluded to is that it’s often the husbands who are reluctant to reconnect physically.

They won’t admit they find it impossible to think of their wives sexually after witnessing them give birth, or that they feel they succumbed to peer pressure to stay by her side during labour. A view like mine might be unfashionable, but men being at the birth is a very recent phenomenon.

Gordon Ramsay once said if he watched his wife in labour, his sex life would be damaged by images he’d only ever want to see in a sci-fi movie: ‘It would feel like skinned rabbits and conger eels coming at me from everywhere. I didn’t want that to be in my memory.’

At the time, I felt really sorry for his wife, Tana, forced to live with such a dinosaur. But now, I can’t help but agree.
