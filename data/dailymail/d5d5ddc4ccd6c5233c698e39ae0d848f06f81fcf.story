Royal Marine: Sergeant Alexander Blackman was found guilty of murdering an injured Afghan fighter

A Royal Marine jailed for life for executing a severely wounded Taliban captive ‘lost his head’ amid fears he would be ‘skinned alive’ if caught by insurgents, a court heard.

Sergeant Alexander Blackman, 39, blasted the Afghan prisoner in the chest at close range with his 9mm pistol in a ‘moment of madness’ on the battlefield.

Blackman – known as Marine A at his trial – is serving a minimum of ten years in prison after becoming the first UK serviceman to be found guilty of murder in a warzone since the Second World War.

Yesterday he launched a legal bid for freedom by having his conviction quashed or sentence reduced.

The experienced commando and his men lived in daily fear of being blown up by IEDs or, worse, captured and mutilated by inhumane enemy fighters, senior judges were told.

Anthony Berry QC, representing Blackman, told the Court Martial Appeal Court the Marine had succumbed to ‘extreme stress’ after a gruelling tour of Helmand.

He said: ‘There was a cocktail of circumstances which led this brave and modest man, to whom loyal duty and allegiance to the corps was second to nothing, briefly to lose his head.

‘The task and stress of leadership is considerable when you hear and see your comrades being killed … and how they fear being caught by Taliban insurgents and knowing what they would do, namely skinning them alive, cutting off their testicles and displaying body parts in trees as a warning to other forces.’

Mr Berry said the conviction was ‘inherently unsafe’ because a seven-man military board was permitted to find him guilty on a simple majority.

He said the odds were stacked unfairly against the Marine at the court martial which meant the conviction failed to ‘satisfy the criminal standard of proof’, and argued the sentence was ‘manifestly excessive’.

The judge at his court martial had not
 taken into account his patrol ‘remained in hostile territory and knew 
of further insurgents in the immediate vicinity’.

As
 well as being jailed, Blackman was dismissed with disgrace from the 
Marines after he had served with distinction for 15 years, including 
tours of Iraq, Afghanistan and Northern Ireland.

Urging
 the three judges to reduce the ten-year term, Mr Berry said: ‘His 
career is over.

His reputation and standing is lost and the loss of the 
comradeship is perhaps the most significant punishment for him to bear.

‘He is a normal citizen, tainted only by the impact of war.’

Blackman,
 from Taunton, Somerset, killed the injured insurgent following a fierce
 firefight on September 15, 2011.

The captive had been hurt by cannon 
fire from an Apache helicopter after an attack on a British base in 
Helmand.

Recordings from a 
helmet-mounted camera worn by a comrade captured the moments when 
Blackman shot the prisoner and told him: ‘Shuffle off this mortal coil, 
you ****.’

He then told his comrades: ‘Obviously this doesn’t go anywhere, fellas. I just broke the Geneva Convention.’

In November, he was convicted of 
murder.

Sentencing Blackman, who served with Plymouth-based 42 Commando,
 Judge Advocate General Jeff Blackett said he had ‘tarnished the 
reputation’ of the Armed Forces.

But
 the severity of the sentence sparked a massive wave of support with 
more than 100,000 people, including MPs and senior military figures, 
calling for leniency.

Blackman’s wife Claire, 42, was at the hearing but said she would not comment until after the court gives its decision.

Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, Sir 
Brian Leveson and Lady Justice Hallett are expected to rule after Easter
 on whether or not the conviction can stand.

The footage was captured by a camera mounted on the helmet of a Royal Marine in the aftermath of a helicopter attack in Helmand.

He shot the unknown insurgent in the 
chest but said he believed the man was already dead and he was taking 
out his anger on a corpse.

As
 the fighter lies on the floor convulsing and struggling for breath, Sgt
 Blackman tells him: 'There you are. Shuffle off this mortal coil you 
c***. It’s nothing you wouldn’t do to us.'

He then turned to his comrades and said: 'Obviously this doesn’t go anywhere fellas. I just broke the Geneva Convention.'

Blackman is the first British serviceman to be found guilty of murder during combat since the Second World War.

Blackman completed tours of Iraq, 
Afghanistan and Northern Ireland during his military career, and before a
 video of the murder came to light, he was being considered for 
promotion to Colour Sergeant.
