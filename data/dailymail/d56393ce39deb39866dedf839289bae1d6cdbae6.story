Parliament watchers expressed outrage over the outburst on Twitter.

What do you think Christopher Pyne said in parliament?

'If the number one whinger in Australia was a reality TV show Madame Speaker, there'd be no point in any other contestant entering it because if Bill Shorten entered it he would win it,' Mr Pyne said.

'But his time, on Thursday night the Leader of the Opposition has an opportunity Madame Speaker.'

Ms Bishop cut in to say: 'The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat'.

Mr Pyne then called Mr Shorten a name.
