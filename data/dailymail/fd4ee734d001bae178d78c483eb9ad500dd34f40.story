Adel Taarabt insisted he is fit enough for the rigours of the Barclays Premier League yet Harry Redknapp claimed he is overweight.

But one thing's for sure: the controversial midfielder is in better shape than the QPR chairman.

Tony Fernandes appeared to make light of the row between his club's manager and playmaker by sharing a self-deprecating picture of his naked torso with the message: 'Getting ready for Villa.'

The Air Asia boss is clearly carrying some extra baggage but Fernandes should be applauded for enjoying a laugh at himself during a tough time for his club.

QPR are rock bottom of the Barclays Premier League with just one win from eight games heading into Monday night's clash against Villa at Loftus Road.

The 3-2 home defeat by Liverpool last Sunday was made all the more miserable by conceding two shambolic own goals during that match and then the following fallout between Redknapp and Taarabt.

Harry Redknapp accused the Moroccan playmaker of being 'three stone overweight'

The 67-year-old manager accused his playmaker of being 'three stone overweight', while Taarabt posed for pictures taken by Sportsmail's Andy Hooper showing his flat stomach in an attempt to prove his fitness.

Fernandes called for an end to the row last week, saying: 'Professional players must be fit. If I do a job I'm ready to do the job. Full stop. The bucks stops at you. It's your body and your career.'

Redknapp now insists that the fuss is over and over the course of a week Fernandes's attitude appears to have mellowed to the point where he can laugh at the issue.

Fernandes also resisted some calls for Redknapp to be replaced as QPR boss by saying on Sunday: 'Let's (get) all our players off the injury list... and then judge Harry.'

Rangers currently have seven players on the treatment table: Niko Kranjcar (illness), Rio Ferdinand (groin), Sandro (groin), Nedum Onuoha (hamstring), Jordon Mutch (hamstring), Joey Barton (hamstring) and Alejandro Faurlin (ACL).

Fernandes also added on his own future: 'When QPR fans want me to go due to my poor decision making I will go. Full stop.'
