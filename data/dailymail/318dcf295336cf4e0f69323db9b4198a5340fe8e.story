Wardens will issue on-the-spot fines to holidaymakers caught feeding seagulls with scraps of food in a West Country seaside city from next week.

Plymouth city council is launching a campaign to tackle the problem of the gulls swooping down on tourists in scenes like something out of the Hitchcock horror film The Birds.

It comes after complaints that the seagulls are becoming a growing menace for residents and tourists alike, snatching food out of people's hands.

'Menace': Plymouth is cracking down on tourists who feed seagulls

Posters are beginning to appear around the city centre warning people not to offer food to seagulls.

Cafes and restaurants with outside eating areas are being asked to quickly remove empty plates and consider using screens and umbrellas to stop the birds from hanging around the tables.

Katie Easter, who owns the Real Food Kitchen in the city centre, said the problem stemmed from tourists feeding the birds.

She added: ‘The seagulls remember and then they come back.

‘It would be a huge shame if there were no seagulls, but if they could be a little more civilised that would be great.’

Nigel Eadie, owner of The Original Pasty House, called seagulls are ‘a real menace’.

He added: ‘They are having a very negative affect on our business, and upon many other local eating establishments throughout the city. 

‘It's a real shame because on a fine day the whole ambiance of the city is so adversely influenced by their aggressive behaviour.’

Plymouth council Brian Vincent, cabinet member for the environment, said ‘We've seen a steady rise in the number of gulls and people complaining about their behaviour.

‘These birds should be at sea where they belong and until we remove their breakfast, lunch, tea and snack sources from them they are going to stay here.

‘We are launching this campaign to remind people we all have a part to play in reducing this problem.’

Spot fines: Tourists caught feeding seagulls in Plymouth will be handed penalties

Now other councils across the 'English Riviera' are debating whether to copy Plymouth City Council and crack down on tourists who encourage seagulls to invade resorts by feeding them.

Similar complaints have been made across Devon and Cornwall, including popular summer resorts like Newquay, Truro, Falmouth and St Ives.

The European Herring Gull is the best known type of gull, and can be seen in seaside areas such as Plymouth all year round.

Growing
 up to 66cm in length and weighing just over 1.5kg, they are one of 
largest and noisiest species of gull, with their loud 'laughing' call 
being the most recognisable.

Tony Whitehead, from the RSPB in the South West, said the number of gulls in seaside towns was increasing due to the amount of food waste available to them.

He added: ‘Gulls are expert scavengers.

'Feeding them or discarding food reinforces their belief that all humans provide an easy food source and reduces their natural wariness of humans.’
