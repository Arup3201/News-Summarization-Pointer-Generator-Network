The mysterious benefactor behind the @HiddenCash phenomenon has finally come forward.

Jason Buzi, a real estate investor and entrepreneur from San Francisco, California, revealed himself this week to be the brain behind the @HiddenCash operation, hiding money across California and drawing large crowds seeking to strike it rich.

Buzi started the hunt on May 22 in San Francisco, using the Twitter handle @HiddenCash to announce the money-drop locations.

Jason Buzi, a real estate investor, revealed this week that he was the mastermind behind @HiddenCash, the phenomenon that swept California

Buzi, who revealed his identity to NBC Bay Area as well as Inside Edition this week, had attempted a similar stunt before. In 2008, Buzi had organized 'CashTomato' in New York City, hiding money in containers of tomatoes in Union Square Park. The publicity stunt quickly devolved into a riot.

According to NBC Bay Area, Buzi had told a local newspaper after the disaster that he would 'plan it better next time.'

In an investigation by NBC Bay Area, it was revealed that Buzi was active in real estate in Palo Alto, California, and had also been involved with multiple money-making enterprises in the past.

Most notably, Buzi worked as a real estate investor in Palo Alto, California, offering to purchase homes for cash. This sparked the ire of some residents, who believed that Buzi was attempting to scam them.

'Real-estate agents obviously don't like me buying right from the seller' Buzi told Palo Alto Online in a 2012 article. 

In addition to this business, Buzi is also listed as involved with multiple other enterprises. This includes an entity called the Pantera Group, listed as doing business in Redwood City, California. The business is not accredited by the Better Business Bureau, and results show up for it on sites like RipoffReport.com.

In the late 90s, Buzi pushed a CD called 'How to Make Big Money on the Internet.' Buzi reportedly promoted this through mass emails, in which he said 'If you have internet access, you have a goldmine at your fingertips.'

Buzi also attempted to write a book, posting a story idea on a forum. 

'The book was to be about a stockbroker who's running different scams and
 then commits murder to cover his tracks," he wrote in his post. 'All 
his scams and schemes come from this insecurity. This is based on 
someone I know.' Buzi admitted to NBC Bay Area that he had written this post.

The cash 
prizes for @HiddenCash, which Buzi hid in Angry Birds toys, ranged from 
$40 to more than $100 for the lucky few who found their own red toy.

'I
 was walking kind of halfheartedly and I kept going and I was like, 
‘That feels like something.’ So reached down and I was like "Oh, my 
gosh"' Amy Howard told NBC Los Angeles. 'It was this red thing and I called the girls over, and now they have some cash.'

'I
 love to give back,' Buzi told the Los Angeles Times before revealing 
his identity. 'I would love to have more join me to give back more.'

One family took Buzi's message to heart,
 using their winnings to continue the theme of paying-it-foward, by 
giving the money to the homeless.

Despite his previous business history, Buzi insisted that @HiddenCash is a 'not a business or promotion' and 'not for profit'
