A sandwich firm was ordered to pay almost £5,000 for preparing meals in a factory with food-splattered walls and filthy floors. 

Seasons in Newcastle was found guilty of five breaches of health and safety regulations after inspectors visited its kitchens at Foundry Lane Industrial Estate. 

The business's owner said he 'took his eye off the ball' as workers prepared sandwiches in 'grimy' conditions. 

Seasons was fined thousands after council inspectors visited the site and discovered its filthy conditions 

The company admitted to five different breaches of health and safety regulations including failure to ensure staff maintained a high degree of personal cleanliness 

Dirty: Knives and utensils are stored in a dirty cup at the factory in Newcastle where staff failed to meet several health and safety regulations 

Staff at the firm had extremely poor personal hygiene and failed to store sandwich fillings in the fridge, Newcastle Magistrates Court heard. 

The company admitted failing to ensure food handlers maintained a high degree of cleanliness, storing food ingredients at temperatures that might result in a risk to health, failing to maintain the floor surface and having no hazard control procedure in place. 

It was fined £2,500 and ordered to pay £2,140 costs in addition to a £120 victim surcharge. 

Business owner John Robson said the failings occurred as he 'took his eye off the ball'. 

Paula Davis, food safety team manager, said the company was given a number of chances after officers visited the site in August and September last year before the council decided to press ahead with a prosecution. 

'General cleanliness was poor and everything was just dirty and grimy.

'Door handles and switches were grimy and when you are handling sandwiches, the risk you can pass on bacteria is quite high,' she said. 

John Robson, the owner of Seasons, said standards slipped when he went on holiday and 'took his eye off the ball;

A Newcastle City Council spokesman said conditions in the factory were 'unacceptable' and 'shoddy' 

The factory in Foundry Lane Industrial Estate (pictured) had exposed concrete floors which are difficult to clean, said officials 

'The floors were really rotten; there was exposed concrete which you can't really clean properly.

'The personal cleanliness of food handlers was also poor.'

'The manufacturer pleaded guilty but got a real shock and has since been working really closely with us.

'There is now a decent business there which is far less likely to cause any problems for people.'

Councillor Stephen Powers, cabinet member for community safety and regulation at

Newcastle City Council, said: 'It was simply unacceptable for this company to be preparing food in such dirty and shoddy premises.

'I'm pleased to note that since our successful prosecution Seasons has "upped its game" and has now improved its practices and procedures.'

John Robson, who owns the business, said: 'We have changed everything around now.

'I was on holiday at the time and I took my eye off the ball a little bit.

'Staff were totally unsupervised because I wasn't there at the time.

'Everything has been put right and we are now back on a level footing.'
