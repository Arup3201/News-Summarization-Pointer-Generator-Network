Regret is etched across Samir Nasri’s face when talk turns to last season’s Champions League defeat against Barcelona.

It still rankles. Not only the result, not only Martin Demichelis’s decisive red card in the first leg, but also Manchester City’s approach.

‘Were we naive against Barca? Yes, we were,’ says the Frenchman. ‘It’s still difficult to talk about. We were flying before the Barca matches, but then we had three or four starters who had injuries and it wasn’t the same.

Samir Nasri spoke of his regret as a press conference on Monday whilst reflecting on last year's campaign

‘I just think last year was a little bit too much for the whole club. Manchester City had never played in the last 16 of the Champions League before, so it was too much pressure, too big a game.

‘Against a team like Barca you cannot make the kind of mistakes we did. You have to play your game. We let them play and we didn’t play our own game.

‘Usually we have possession of the ball but against Barca we didn’t, we just defended. We are not a team who knows how to just defend.’

Nasri, alongside manager Manuel Pellegrini, is optimistic the side can topple Barcelona this season

Fast forward 12 months and Nasri believes he will not be haunted by the same regrets after the clubs’ Champions League sequel.

Nasri’s face is now wide-eyed with optimism. He feels Barca are beatable this time. He has spotted chinks in their armour.

He knows exactly how the two-legged tie needs to play out for City to make a statement that reverberates across Europe.

‘I watched both Paris Saint-Germain versus Barcelona matches in the Champions League this season and I think there’s things we can do,’ he said. They still have great players, but Dani Alves is not the Dani Alves of four or five years ago. We can hurt their defence.

‘I just hope we can keep a clean sheet in the first leg and then we will have a good chance to qualify.

‘We conceded two goals at home last year, so it was too hard for us to go to the Nou Camp and qualify.’

Nasri can expect to play a pivotal role for Manuel Pellegrini on Tuesday night . For he is one of the Chilean’s key midfield creators. The Frenchman’s superb goal in the 2-0 win at Roma that clinched qualification to the knockout stages in December is testament to that.

And in Pellegrini, Nasri has a manager he says he has bonded with. Contrast that with his difficult relationship with Pellegrini’s predecessor Roberto Mancini. The Italian spent the summer of 2011 trying to persuade Nasri to leave Arsenal for the Etihad, only for their relationship to deteriorate.

‘Pellegrini gave me back the joy of playing football,’ says Nasri. ‘He is like Arsene Wenger. Someone who likes to joke, someone who likes to talk and take an interest in your life.

‘I love to have this kind of relationship with a manager, when it’s not just about football.’

Similarly, there is no love lost between Nasri and France manager Didier Deschamps. A breakdown in relations between the pair resulted in the City forward missing out on a World Cup place last summer.

Nine months on, does the 27-year-old wish the situation had been handled differently? Absolutely not.

Nasri has scored in his last two matches to help keep up the pressure on Premier League leaders Chelsea

‘Apart from the World Cup, for me club football is bigger,’ he said. ‘The World Cup is the World Cup and I’m sad I won’t play in it, that’s my only regret. But to play a friendly with my national team, I did it many times so it’s not something I’m missing.

‘I suffered more when I was happy with France. I live in England and I don’t really notice what they say about me, but my family will suffer and I don’t want this.’

Nasri will be hoping even more he does not suffer at the hands of Messi & Co again.
