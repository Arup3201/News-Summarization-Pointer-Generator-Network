She may originally hail from the tropical rainforests of Indonesia but that did not stop tigress Daseep getting stuck into a snowball fight.

Instead of waiting for room service in her heated enclosure, the two-year-old Sumatran tiger wanted to explore the first deep snow she had seen.

Keepers at Dudley Zoological Gardens kept her entertained by playing the unusual game of catch.

Stop that! Daseep looks cross as keepers throw snowballs but staff said she loved playing in the white stuff

Jill Hitchman from the zoo in Dudley, West Midlands, said: 'This is 
the first heavy snow Daseep has seen and keepers thought she would stay 
cosy in her heated den, but she couldn't wait to explore.

'Keepers 
built her a snowman which she demolished in minutes then spent the afternoon throwing snowballs which she absolutely loved catching with 
her paws.'

Staff told the Birmingham Mail that the plummeting temperatures meant they had to smash frozen pools in the penguin enclosure and part of the moat that is home to Patagonian sealions also froze over.

But the cold weather was ideal for those animals, while the less hardy creatures such as meerkats and small primates stayed indoors.

Parts of the West Midlands have been hit
by more than three inches of snow in recent days making it difficult 
for zoo staff to travel across the 40-acre site.

Staff had to use sledges to get food to the zoo's 1,300 animals.

Zoo chief executive Peter Suddock told the Birmingham Mail said staff have used manual labour to transport food and bedding in the snow since the zoo opened in 1937.

He said: 'It's a huge hilly site which is difficult to negotiate in icy conditions, but we always manage to get round it all and ensure every animal is fed.

Mr Suddock added: 'Itâ€™s business as usual for us and lots of the animals
love this weather, particularly our young tigers and baby red panda, 
but others are staying holed up and opting for "room service" until the 
weather improves.'
