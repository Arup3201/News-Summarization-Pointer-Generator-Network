A lying Yelp reviewer has been caught out by restaurant owners after they released surveillance footage showing he was in their restaurant for just 22 seconds.

The user, known as Dan. W, posted a scathing, one-star assessment of wonderful in Millbrae near San Francisco, California, claiming staff refused to seat him as he was alone, and even said they turned him down because of what he was wearing.

Owners of the venue saw the negative appraisal and decided to investigate.

After looking over video captured at the restaurant's front door, they discovered that the disgruntled customer didn't speak to a single member of staff and quickly left after looking at the waiting list.

Outed: Owners of Chinese restaurant wonderful in Millbrae, California, uploaded surveillance footage of Dan. W after he wrote a one-star review of the venue. Here he is entering the store at 19:07

In response they uploaded the damning video to their website and barred Dan from returning - saying that he will be 'arrested for trespassing' if he comes back. 

The review was taken down by Yelp following a request by the restaurant, but has since been re-published by San Francisco Eater.

It read: 'My experience was at around 7;30pm on a Wednesday. I was flying solo that night, after a particularly challenging day. The waiter came up and asked how many [sic]. 

'I said one, I had planned to sit at the bar or get the food to go. She said 'one? no, one?' and then ran off. I waited a minute at the door, and then left. They were busy and potentially understaffed. It's not that classy of a place, but they refused to seat me. 

'Sure, I was wearing jeans and a baseball cap with my flannel shift not tucked in. I had no intentions of taking a full table, just any corner I could fit in, or order off the menu to go once the guy next to me was done with it. 

'Oh well, next time I go out in a group of three to six we'll take our business elsewhere. 

Fabrication: He claimed that staff refused to seat him. But the clip shows he doesn't speak to anyone else and only peers into the seating area of the restaurant 

'The key to a good business is to be consistent in the small things. That sucks, I just wanted food and I had cash, just as I sat down two people called me back and my entourage of 6 had an amazing dinner at Thai stick.'

After his lie was uncovered, the restaurant posted a number of videos to their own website under the title: 'No the customer is not always right'.

The accompanying message read: 'In this first video, you can see that you entered at 19:07, which is earlier than you quoted.

'You can also see that you did not wait a minute at the door. You spent a total of 22 seconds in the establishment. 

'This video also clearly shows that there were other patrons waiting. We are sincerely sorry that we forgot to recognize your very, very 'VIP' status at wonderful, a status so special that you don't have to sign the waiting list like everyone else… I've never been to a restaurant where to refuse to seat people because they're wearing what you were wearing… You're dreaming if you think that's why you didn't get service.

'You can clearly see Dan walk into the picture from the outside at 19:07:00, and then he leaves the picture at 19:08:00. He does not communicate with any servers, and servers were cleaning tables to be able to serve the next customers in line on the waiting list posted at the door.

'Dan, we didn't refuse to seat you. You refused to wait in line like everyone else. You thought you were special, so special that you don't have to follow the rules. That's not true, we caught you.

'You are prohibited from returning to wonderful. If we catch you, you will be arrested for trespassing.'

Quick exit: Just 22 seconds after walking into the restaurant, Dan. W is seen leaving. He insists he is not the man in the video and has demanded that the restaurant take it down 

Busy: Another angle shows Dan surveying the seating area before deciding to leave. He claimed he was in the store for a minute 

Dan. W then responded in another Yelp review, claiming the man in the footage was not him and ordered it to be removed as he was being harassed online and it was 'damaging his reputation'

It read: 'Aftermath: the owner put an inflammatory response with video of someone else claiming it was me. I also did not give you permission to put video of me on the internet. 

'After that people start harrasing [sic] me and threatening to tarnish my reputation online if I did not remove this review. 

'I'd love a ceasefire, take down your BS and I'll gladly take down this review (which again is not fake). That response and situation of only further shows you character. Perhaps they cyberbully and threaten anyone who rates less than a 3?'

The restaurant responded again, saying: 'In the interest of being fair to what you said, I am posting video of our service from 18:45 to 19:30 on 18 March 2015. 

'If at any time you see yourself walk in and talk to the server, let me know, and I will gladly post a large banner that says 'I'm sorry Dan for calling you a liar'. 

'Otherwise, you must be hearing voices, because I sure don't see you talking to anyone in the restaurant. '

Response: Management at the venue have barred Dan from returning - saying that he will be 'arrested for trespassing' if he comes back
