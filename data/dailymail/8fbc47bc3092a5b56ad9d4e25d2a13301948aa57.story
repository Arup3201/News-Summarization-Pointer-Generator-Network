Authorities investigating the death 
of a Texas district attorney arrested a former justice of the peace and 
charged him on Saturday with making a 'terroristic threat' after 
searching his home.

Eric Williams, 46, was admitted to the Kaufman County Jail early Saturday morning, jail records show.

Bond was set at $1 million for the terroristic threat charge and at $1 million each for two charges of insufficient bond.

Officials have not named Williams as a
suspect in the March 30 shooting deaths of District Attorney Mike 
McLelland and his wife, Cynthia, or in the late January death of 
assistant DA Mark Hasse, who was fatally shot as he was leaving work in 
Kaufman, about 30 miles southeast of Dallas.

But federal and local authorities searched Williams' home Friday as part of an investigation into the McLellands' deaths.

The district attorney's office 
prosecuted Williams, and he was convicted in March 2012 of burglary of a
building and theft by a public servant.

Williams, who was sentenced to two months of probation, lost his justice of the peace position as a result of the conviction.

Spokesmen for the FBI and the Kaufman
County Sheriff's Office confirmed Friday they were executing a search 
warrant but declined to provide details. The sheriff's office said the 
warrant's underlying affidavit was ordered sealed by a judge.

Williams' attorney, David Sergi, 
released a statement Friday saying his client 'has cooperated with law 
enforcement and vigorously denies any and all allegations.'

'He wishes simply to get on with his life and hopes that the perpetrators are brought to justice,' Sergi said.

Earlier this month, Williams said he 
voluntarily submitted to a gun residue test and turned over his 
cellphone after authorities contacted him while investigating the deaths
of the McLellands.

Authorities have released little 
information about the case except to say they continue to follow leads, 
including possible ties to a white supremacist gang.

One month before Hasse's death, the 
Texas Department of Public Safety issued a warning to authorities 
statewide that the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas could retaliate for an 
October indictment that targeted some of its leaders. McLelland's office
was involved in that investigation.

Newly obtained surveillance footage shows Kaufman County, Texas, district attorney Mike McLelland shopping for guns only hours before he was assassinated. 

The footage was captured by security cameras at a Forney, Texas, gun shop at about 1:30 p.m last Friday.

The next day, both McLelland and his wife Cynthia were found murdered in their house.

McLelland often carried a gun but was interested in weapons for his staff

Store owner O'Neill Kidwill said McLelland often stopped in to chat and look at guns

Store owner O'Neill Kidwill told CBS News McLelland was more worried about his coworker's safety than his own.

'I was showing him one of the revolvers,' Kidwill said. 'I asked him if he was ever in fear of his life, he said no. He was more worried about his coworkers.'

Precautions: Assistant DA Mark Hasse was shot dead on January 31

McLelland asked for recommendations for guns to give his employees, who were terrified by the January murder of assistant district attorney Mark Hasse.

McLelland himself seemed calm.

'He
didn't seem like anything was going to happen to him. He was 
invincible. He was happy,' Kidwill said. 'Everything was good in his 
world.'

The men talked for about 30 minutes as McLelland shopped.

Kidwill said he recommended 38-caliber revolvers and bulletproof vests for his staff. He also recommended that McLelland wear a vest himself. 

However after CBS released its interview, Kidwill took to Facebook to clarify that McLelland was a regular in the gun shop and was not there out of fear.

'Mike came in once or twice a week to be around other gun 
enthusiast/hobbyists because that’s what he was, and to be around good 
friends to swap war stories and just talk,' Kidwill wrote. 'He never talked about what he
knew about his assistants murder. He was confident the killer would 
face justice. And we very much hope they do.I have also been misquoted 
by saying mike took to carrying his 38 after marks murder. Truth is mike
has always carried his gun, it’s his job.'

Kidwill was one of hundreds who attended the McLellands' service, along with dozens of law enforcement officers and 
public officials, including Texas Governor Rick Perry.

According to CNN, an affidavit on Thursday revealed further details of the investigations into the couple's deaths.

Friends
reportedly found the bodies of the DA and his wife after going to their
home on Saturday evening, having not heard from them in almost 24 
hours. They were found with multiple gunshot wounds.

Fears: District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife Cynthia were gunned down at their ranch-style bungalow on Saturday

Police
have requested phone records for the McLellands for the last two months
to see if more can be discovered about the days leading up to the fatal
attack.

At their funeral service on Thursday, Mr and Mrs McLelland shared a single, flag-draped casket inside the suburban church.

McLelland had addressed many of the 
same people two months earlier, after the slaying of Mark Hasse, one of 
his prosecutors. Hasse was gunned down near the Kaufman County 
courthouse while going to work.

The deaths are feared to be planned attacks by violent white supremacist gang, the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas.

McLelland
was pivotal in the prosecution of a senior member of the Aryan 
Brotherhood of Texas last year who received two life terms following a 
shoot out.

No arrests have been made in either case. The reward for information leading to a conviction has been doubled to $200,000.

Days after the bodies were discovered, assistant DA Jay Hileman sent a short email to the defense team today saying that he was stepping down for security reasons.

He is being replaced by another
Department of Justice prosecutor from Washington D.C. who will 
travel to Houston to join the high-profile case.

That individual will join attorney 
David Karpel from the DOJ's gang unit in prosecuting 
the large racketeering case, according to Dallasnews.com.

McLelland told The Associated Press shortly before his death that
he was warning his employees that they needed to be more cautious as 
well.

'The people in my 
line of work are going to have to get better at it,' he said of dealing 
with the danger, 'because they're going to need it more in the future'.

Several people on Thursday remembered that spirit of persistence and defiance.

Standing
in front of the casket, Foreman told the audience they had a 
responsibility not to let fear stop them from fighting to do right 
thing.

She said she 
believed her mother and stepfather had prepared her for this moment, 
when she and her siblings must go on without them.

'The right thing is never easy,' said Christina Foreman, one of the five children the couple shared. 'And he knew that. And he stood up anyway.'
