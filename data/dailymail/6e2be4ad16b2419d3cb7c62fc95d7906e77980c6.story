Among Lucia Terui's first diving experiences was an encounter with Nomura's jellyfish, the graceful giants of the sea that grow up to 6ft 6in in diameter.

Perhaps understandably the sighting inspired an obsession for Terui, 40, to one day photograph the creatures, which are 100 times the size of an average jellyfish and are most commonly found in the waters between China and Japan.

And when the Brazilian photographer achieved her goal on a diving trip into the waters of Echizen, Fukui province, Japan, she said she felt 'pure joy'.

After seeing the giant jellyfish, Lucia says she 'became obsessed with them and getting the perfect shot, and years later I got my moment'

Photographer Lucia Terui encountered the creatures on her diving trip

'On one of my first ever diving trips I had the privilege to dive with this particular jellyfish,' says Lucia, now of Hamamatsu, Japan.

'I was delighted and it was an incredible experience, but on that particular occasion I didn't have the underwater photography equipment to capture the images in the way I wanted.

'From then on I became obsessed with them and getting the perfect shot, and years later I got my moment.'

Lucia was able to photograph the enormous five-foot jellyfish in all its glory.

She spent three days diving with her husband, Alexandre Shimoishi, 40, on the lookout for the incredible creature.

Lucia says: 'I had to dive deep into the open sea to be able to find one, but it was worth it in the end and I felt pure joy when I did.

'It was a dream of mine achieved, the jellyfish are so beautiful and inoffensive, and because of that I wasn't afraid at all.

'A lot of patience was needed, as there were lot of jellyfish in the sea but most of them were hurt or almost dead, I wanted one that was healthy and a beauty to shoot.'

The Nomura's jellyfish is classified in the same category as the lion's mane jellyfish, the largest cnidarian in the world.

The diameter when fully grown is slightly greater than the height of an average man, with the ability to grow up to 6ft 6in.

Although their stings are generally very painful, they are not known for causing any major damage to humans.

Despite their formidable size, Lucia loves photographing nature's gentle giants.

She says: 'It's funny because most of the time my friends call me crazy, but they like and admire my photographs and so that really makes me happy.

'It's important that we respect and protect nature that is all around us, I believe this is our duty to life and the future of our planet.'
