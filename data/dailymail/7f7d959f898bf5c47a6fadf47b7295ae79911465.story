Tottenham are rivalling Arsenal in the bid to sign Toulouse right-back Serge Aurier.

Talks are already underway for Swansea left-back Ben Davies but coach Mauricio Pochettino is also chasing a right-back with Kyle Walker recuperating from a pelvic injury.

Aurier has been one of the few successes for Ivory Coast in a disappointing World Cup campaign.Â

Hopes ended: Tottenham were hopeful of securing a deal to sign Aurier ahead of rivals Arsenal

The 21-year-old has looked exciting going forward and would suit Tottenham's style.

He was clocked running at 33.52km/h during the World Cup group game against Colombia - faster than Arjen Robben - and thankfully in the right direction.

Arsenal have long been considered favourites for his signature while Marseille have also shown an interest but Tottenham hope to steal a march over the coming days.

They are awaiting an improved offer from Hull for defender Michael Dawson who they will sell for the right price.

Hull and Tottenham also had an interest in Hector Moreno of Espanyol but any move for the Mexican is on hold after he broke his leg against Holland on Sunday.
