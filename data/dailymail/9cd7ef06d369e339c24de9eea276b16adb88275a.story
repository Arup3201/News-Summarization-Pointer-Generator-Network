Victim: Spencer Bell, 71, pictured with his wife Wendy, died after getting out to help a man who had jumped off a bridge over the M1

A good Samaritan who was killed when he stopped on a busy motorway to help a man who had leapt from a bridge was named yesterday as great-grandfather Spencer Bell.

The selfless 71-year-old got out of his car on the M1 near Watford to go to the aid of the man, but was hit by another vehicle.

Both men were pronounced dead at the scene of Thursday’s accident.

Mr Bell’s family, from Bushey, Hertfordshire, said: ‘Spencer was the most loving, funny and generous person.

‘Everyone who knew him loved his quick wit and kindness.

‘We cannot imagine life without him, he always had a smile on his face and loved life.

‘Knowing he died in such a selfless way is no comfort. But we would not have expected anything else of him.’

He was married with three children.

The other man who died has been identified as Alan Trethewey, 67, of Watford.

Police said Mr Bell was one of a number of motorists who stopped to help Mr Trethewey as he lay in the middle of the carriageway.

Witnesses at the scene described Mr Bell's heroic actions as the horrifying events unfolded in front of them.

Coach passenger Rebecca Martin, a 
theatre manager from Manchester, said: ‘We came to a screeching halt and
 found out a man  had jumped from the bridge in  front of us.

‘I
 thought it was a car crash at first, but there was no bang. I knew 
something was very wrong straight away.

The man's family said today 'We cannot imagine life without him, he always had a smile on his face'

Scene: Police officers set up a screen on the M1 near Herefordshire after the two men died. The lorry was not thought to be involved in the incident

Recovery operation: A silver Audi was seen being towed away from the area after the incident

'We were just three or four cars 
behind it. A car stopped and a man got out to help and was hit by 
another car.’

‘It’s awful. 
It was bad enough that one person fell off the bridge, but then to find 
out that a guy who stopped to help was killed is just so sad.

'He
 was obviously a very courageous guy – a real hero.’ The 32-year-old 
added: ‘I don’t know what I would have done in that situation.

‘It’s nice to know there are lovely people out there who would do something like that.’

After the crash, Rupert
 Gadd, from the Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire police 
road crash investigation unit, said: ‘A male is known to have jumped 
from the bridge parapet on to the carriageway.

Road closed: Hertfordshire Police and the East of England Ambulance Service were called to the incident on the northbound carriageway near Junction 5, close to the village of Bricket Wood, at about 10.45am

Location: The incident happened near Junction 5 of the M1, close to Bricket Wood in Hertfordshire
