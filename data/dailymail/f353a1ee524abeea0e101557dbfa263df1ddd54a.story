Two children watched in horror as their mother was turned into a human fireball when a barbecue exploded in the sun.

Mother-of-two Hayley Hassard was watching her son play cricket when a gas canister blew up and ignited her thin summer dress last weekend.

Her friend Angie Hall tackled her to the ground and rolled her until the flames were extinguished - leaving the 45-year-old badly burned.

Injured: Mother-of-two Hayley Hassard was left with burns on her leg and back after her dress caught alight when a BBQ gas canister exploded

Ms Hassard has to change the dressings on the burns on her legs and back every two days and is unable to work or even sit properly while her injuries heal.

Ms Hassard, from Hull, East Yorks, said: 'I saw the flames go up on the barbecue and remember thinking it was a bit bright and I moved Angie away.

'The next thing I knew I saw a white flash and someone said it was a canister that had exploded.

'My dress just lit up and caught fire. It was only a thin summer dress. Someone shouted "Hayley is on fire".'

Ms Hassard tried to put the flames out as her sons Jack, 11, and Sam, eight, watched helplessly.

She added: 'The next think I knew, Angie was on top of me and she’d rugby tackled me to the ground.

'She didn’t think of herself. She just did it. I dread to think what would have happened if it wasn’t for her quick actions.

'People were standing there frozen and she just went into action.

Lucky: Ms Hassard with friend Angie Hall who managed to grapple her to the ground and roll her until the flames went out

'My husband was running across the field. I think I would be in a specialist burns unit now, dealing with much more severe injuries, if it wasn’t for her.

'I want to highlight to people to know what to do if something like this happens. Angie’s quick actions are what saved me from much more serious injuries.'

Angie Hall, 53, of Kingswood, said instinct took over when she saw her friend engulfed in flames.

She said: 'Hayley told me to move forward as the flames were high on the barbecue.

The next thing I knew, there was an explosion and everyone screamed and ran. All I heard was someone shout "Hayley is on fire".

'Hayley was spinning around trying to get it out. Instinct kicked in, I pushed her over and started rolling her.

'Everyone has said she was like a fireball. It was a gut reaction for me, I just wanted to get there and knock her over.'

Ms Hassard had been enjoying watching her son Sam play cricket at a sports field in Willerby when the canister exploded.

Her father, Terry Gosnell, who was also there, said: 'There were quite a few people there. If it had not been for Angie, her burns would have been dreadful.

'I can’t bear to think about it. She raced over and rugby tackled her to the floor and rolled her 20 or 30 yards.

'Hayley’s burns would have been far more serious. Instead of her back and tops of her legs, we would have been looking at her whole body. We are so grateful.'
