It may sound like a joke - a robotic stand-up comic winning a science photography prize.

But it's true, in a sense. An image of a robot performing a comedy routine in front of an audience has won the first Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council photographic competition.

The show by RoboThespian was part of a study called Comedy Lab: Human vs Robot, by Toby Harris, a PhD student at Queen Mary University of London.

Competition winner: The picture called Human vs Robot, by Toby Harris, a PhD student at Queen Mary University of London

The performance at London's Barbican Centre alongside comics Tiernan Douieb and Andrew O'Neill won the competition for photographs that demonstrate science in action.

Mr Harris, from QML's cognitive science research group, used the robot alongside live comedians in a series of settings to research performer-audience interaction.

Mr Harris said he was thrilled to have won, and added: 'This ground-breaking research is helping us to understand both what makes for a great performance and what makes for a compelling audience experience.

'We use new technologies to analyse people's moment-by-moment responses, so while teaching a robot stagecraft was fun, it was the ability to read and react to the audience that made it work.'

Microfluidics - huge advances on microscale level, by Ms Elisabeth Kastner, Aston University , which won first place in the Equipment section

RoboThespian is a British-made robot equipped with cameras, depth perception and facial recognition. It is 
capable of reacting to its audience and adapting its script accordingly.

The battery-powered robots are produced in a factory in Penryn, Cornwall, where it takes engineers 
around a week to build one of the human-like machines from scratch.

A single 
robot starts at around £55,000 each.

RoboThespian can also be controlled remotely by people using a tablet in another room, 
while his facial expression can also be changed.

Other winners in the competition included pictures of an apparently levitating maths teacher, a 3-D printer creating objects in bronze and an image of lung cancer cells.
