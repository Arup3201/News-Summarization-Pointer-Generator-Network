A driver has captured the shocking moment a young girl on her bike crashed head-on into their car but got up and walked away.

The car was driving slowly along a one lane road in a caravan park, in Camden in Sydney's south-west, when a little girl dressed in pink came zooming around the corner and slammed into the car's bonnet.

Debris flies off the bike in the hard to watch video, filmed in June with a Dash Cam, and the driver is heard swearing on impact.

Astonishingly the the girl, who was saved by her pink and black helmet, gets up from the floor straight away.

As she grabs her leg and looks at the car a woman who witnessed the crash walks over and asks 'are you okay?'.

Even more witnesses then walk onto the scene and stare at the car before bending down to help the girl.

The footage was published on Dash Com Owners Australia's Facebook page.

The young girl appeared from round the corner on her bike 

The Dash Cam filmed the shocking moment she collided with the car

The child stood up after the crash and looked at the driver but was not hurt 

Witnesses to the crash ran over to ask if she was OK

A caption alongside the video explained: 'You never know whats coming around the corner. This was in popular tourist park in Camden NSW.

'Share to show you don't need to be going fast to be in an accident. The girl and driver were Ok.'

The organisations online forum documents the dangerous things that happen on Australia's road, all filmed on Dash Cams.

Posts on the forum include 'motorcycle riders showing off', a ute reversing up a main road during peak traffic, taxis jumping red lights and p-plater disasters.
