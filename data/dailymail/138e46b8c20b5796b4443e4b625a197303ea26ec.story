Conservative MP Stephen Barclay, who says he has figures showing 39 doctors have removed themselves from the medical register rather than face a disciplinary hearing 

Doctors who are accused of serious malpractice are taking early retirement so they can avoid going to disciplinary hearings, according to an MP.

The claims come from Conservative MP Stephen Barclay, who says figures he has obtained show 39 doctors have removed themselves from the medical register in the past three years rather than face a disciplinary hearing.

Voluntary erasure is usually granted to doctors who don't want to retain their UK registration due to retirement or moving abroad.

However according to the Telegraph, Mr Barclay has figures showing that 39 doctors removed themselves from the register and those who had suffered due to medical incompetence were then suffering further 'injustice'.

All bar seven of the names of the doctors have been released by the General Medical Council.

However chief executive of the GMC Niall Dickson told the newspaper: 'There's no better way to protect the public than stopping them from practising as a doctor.'

'If at any time they then tried to get back on the register the case against them would become active again and where there are serious concerns realistically it is highly unlikely they could ever practise again.'

According to his blog, Mr Barclay says he has been working with the General Medical Council in relation to disciplinary procedures for doctors and raised the issue in parliament.

He wrote: 'I am keen to get this addressed following the death of Nikki Sams, whose case I have raised with the General Medical Council in the past.

'Nikki was just twenty-six when she died of cervical cancer in 2007, which her GP had not diagnosed after failing to spot the symptoms eight times.

'He escaped disciplinary action by retiring, despite having been investigated.'

Earlier this month, the GMC also launched a new consultation which questions whether or not doctors across the UK should be required to say sorry if they have previously failed to do so.

Earlier this month, the GMC also launched a new consultation to question whether doctors should be made to say sorry if they have failed to do so 

Whether or not they have apologised may also be taken into account when a fitness to practice panel is deciding on what sanctions the medic faces, the document states.

Meanwhile, those who fail to blow the whistle if they have concerns about the capability of a colleague could face stricter sanctions under plans outlined in the consultation document.

The doctors' regulator says it has set out the series of proposals to help 'improve patient protection and public confidence in doctors.'
