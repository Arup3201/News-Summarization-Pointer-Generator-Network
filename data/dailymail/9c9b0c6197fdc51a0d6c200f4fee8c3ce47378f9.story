David Cameron today rejected the idea of Britain becoming a second class member of the European Union, insisting he would not give up his place at the Brussels ‘table’.

The Prime Minister gave his biggest hint yet that he will use his imminent speech on Europe to rebuff calls from many in the Tory party for a radical change in the UK’s membership of the EU.

It comes as Virgin boss Sir Richard 
Branson warned an exit from the EU 'would be very bad for British 
business and the economy as a whole' and risked putting up 'the barriers
of isolation and protectionism'.

David Cameron, who is due to give a major speech setting out his Europe policy this month, vowed not to give up Britain's place in setting EU rules

Mr Cameron explicitly rejected the idea of replicating the status of countries like Norway and Switzerland which have refused to join the EU, but are forced to sign up to many of its rules in order to access the single market.

But he pledged voters would get a 'real choice' on Britain's relationship with the EU, including attempting to claw back powers.

However, UKIP Leader Nigel Farage said the British people could not believe what Mr Cameron says.

Mr Farage said: 'He sits there and thinks his great extended tease about this forthcoming Europe speech is entertaining, it is not.

[No matter what he says now, after so many broken promises, so many "cast-iron guarantees", can anybody honestly believe that he will be telling the truth this time? The simple fact is that he wants us to stay in the European Union no matter how it is configured.'

An influential group of European federalists, who want to see Brussels given even greater powers, is suggesting the UK be relegated to ‘associate member’ status.

The move would see Britain remain part of the single market but freed from much of the social legislation and bureaucracy associated with full EU membership.

Under the plan the UK's 73 MEPs in the European Parliament would be scrapped, along with its commissioner and power to veto new rules.

Instead Britain would remain attached to the EU’s single market, but not have influence on how the European bloc develops.

The idea has been hailed as ‘great news’ but senior Euroceptic Tory MPs, who have urged Mr Cameron to set out a radical new European policy in his long-awaited speech this month.

But critics warn it would see London ‘ruled by fax’ from Brussels.

Mr Cameron today again rejected the idea of leaving the EU altogether.

‘I think we are better in. You have to think of our national interest. Britain is a trading nation, we are one of the world's great trading nations, one of the world's great manufacturers, on our doorstep is this enormous single market, the biggest market in the world.

‘It matters to us not just that our goods and services have access to these markets,' he told BBC Radio 5Live.

‘We want to be round the table writing the rules of that market, which is why I don't think it’s right to aim for a status like Norway or Switzerland where basically you have to obey all the rules of the single market but you don't get to say what they are.’

Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson warned Britain had to play an active role in Europe or become 'an island completely adrift in 20 years'

The idea of 'associate membership' is 
being pushed by the Union of European Federalists which views Britain as
a ‘continual impediment’ to the dream of creating a united federal 
Europe.

Lib Dem MEP Andrew Duff, who heads the Union of European Federalists, said the proposal would create a new category of EU membership to stop Britain leaving altogether.

‘If
David Cameron proposes a catalogue of opt-outs, derogations, red lines 
and rebates for Britain to pick and choose, then he will strengthen the 
argument for the creation of a formal association for the UK,’ he said..

‘The priority on the Continent
is to create a federal system which works and Britain is seen at 
present as a continual impediment.

‘The federal movement in the spring is to draft a new treaty that will, I have no doubt, include associate membership.’

The Union of European Federalists is expected to set out the plan in a draft EU treaty in the spring.

Last
week Jacques Delors, the former European Commission president, 
suggested Britain could leave the EU but remain as a ‘partner’.

'If
the British do not follow the tendency towards more integration in the 
European Union, we can anyway stay friends, but in another way,’ he 
said.

However, business leaders have warned against leaving the EU.

Writing on his blog, Virgin Group boss Sir Richard Branson said: 'An exit would be very bad for British business and the economy as a whole.

'The UK has always been a successful trading nation and has built relationships around the world to help its companies prosper. However, today global business relies on large trading agreements created by regions and not by countries.

'The EU is the UK's biggest trading partner. The UK must not become a peripheral country on the edge of Europe. This will be damaging to long-term prospects of British business and also in the country's ability to attract new international companies to set up and employ people in the country.'

Without taking a postieve, constructive approach 'Britain could be an island completely adrift in 20 years,' he warned.
