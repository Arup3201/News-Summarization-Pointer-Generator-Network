A nurse accused of engaging in a sex act with another nurse while caring for a 99-year-old stroke victim has pleaded not guilty to charges of neglect and a lewd act by a caregiver.

Alfredo Ruiz, 42, was held on $200,000 bail at a San Diego court on Monday but his co-accused Russel Torralba remains at large.

Deputy District Attorney Paul Greenwood told the court that a video shows the in-home nurses engaging in a sex act near the bedridden woman they were caring for.

The woman’s daughter suspected that her mother was not being cared for properly and complained to the defendants’ employer.

After numerous complaints yielded no results, family members viewed video from security cameras that had been installed in the woman’s home years earlier.

Mr Greenwood told the court that the video, filmed in March 2011, shows Ruiz and Torralba engaging in a sex act and Ruiz taking the woman’s hand and putting it on his groin area.

Both men are charged with four 
counts of elder neglect by a caregiver and 
one count of lewd act by a caregiver on a dependent adult.

Fellow nurse Russel Torralba has also been charged with neglect by a caregiver and a lewd act by a caregiver but he remains at large

The woman is said to be unable to speak or 
communicate with her hands after suffering a stroke and right-side 
paralysis in 2005, but is fully aware of her surroundings.

Mr Greenwood added that the defendants are also charged with providing inadequate care for six other residents at two board-and-care facilities in Mira Mesa in 2010.

Both Ruiz and Torralba have lost their nursing licenses and face up to 11 years in prison if convicted.

The case was adjourned until January.
