A North Korean official has claimed there is nothing wrong with the country's 'dear leader' Kim Jong Un - dispelling any rumours of failing health or gout.

Kim Yang-Gon, who heads a ruling party department in charge of South Korea-related affairs, was speaking during an extremely rare visit to South Korea.

Following whispers of a debilitating illness or even a coup in Pyongyang, he told South Korea's Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-Jae - 'there is nothing wrong with the health of Secretary Kim'.

The statement was quoted by the South Korean politician on a television talk show today.

North Korean official, Kim Yang-Gon, was visiting the South's western port of Incheon yesterday to attend the closing ceremony of the Asian Games, along with two other high-ranking officials. 

The delegation, led by Pyongyang's second most powerful man, Hwang Pyong-So, flew back to Pyongyang after a series of meetings with Ryoo and other South Korean officials.

The minister said Hwang had asked him to deliver a 'heartfelt greeting' from Kim Jong-Un to South Korean President Park Geun-Hye, but there was no specific message from the leader.

The North's leader has not been seen in public for a month, fuelling rumours about his health and even triggering reports of a coup.

Kim, 31, who is frequently the centrepiece of the isolated country's propaganda, has not been photographed by state media since September 3, fuelling speculation he is unwell. He has also been seen walking with a limp

A rare admission from North Korea nine days ago that he was suffering 'discomfort' triggered frenzied speculation and close scrutiny of any mention of the young leader in state media. 

In recent state TV footage of Kim his weight appears to have ballooned - thanks in part to an addiction to Swiss cheese. 

He has also been seen walking with a limp since an event with key officials in July and in a pre-recorded documentary broadcast by state media on Thursday appeared to have difficulty walking.

And rumours of an illness multiplied after he failed to attend a meeting of the North's rubber-stamp parliament last week.

Kim, 31, took over the reins of power in North Korea following the death of his father Kim Jong-Il in December 2011.

Michael Madden, an expert on the North Korean leadership and contributor to the 38 North website, believes that the leader is suffering from gout. 

He said: 'Based on his gait, it appears he has gout - something (due to) diet and genetic predisposition that has affected other members of the Kim family.'

The North Korean leader got a taste for Swiss cheese while a student in Switzerland - and is understood to love it so much that he imports vast quantities, despite Western sanctions.

A unhealthy appetite for Emmental, also known as Swiss cheese, is believed to be a key factor in Kim's weight ballooning so much in recent months that he now walks with a limp.

Experts believe Kim may be deliberately gaining weight in order to look more like his grandfather Kim Il-sung, who is venerated in North Korea as the nation's founder and even now - exactly 20 years after his death - is still considered the head of state, with the title Eternal President of the Republic.

Kim Jong-un's unhealthy obsession with Emmental has led to him importing vast quantities of the cheese for his own consumption - despite millions of North Koreans struggling to find enough to eat.

Malnutrition is widespread and famines often break out in the country, which is still reliant on foreign food aid as a result of economic mismanagement and the loss of Soviet support in the 1990s.

But despite the suffering of his 25 million citizens, Kim continues to gorge on Swiss cheese in such vast quantities that he is waistline is expanding at a dangerously rapid rate, according to the Mirror.

North Koreans who have managed to flee the country believe the weight gain may be deliberate in order to look more like his corpulent late grandfather Kim Il-sung.

He established an all-pervasive cult of personality around himself after turning North Korea into a oppressive single-party socialist state in the early 1980s.

Defector Cho Myung-Chul, of the Saenuri Party, said: 'North Koreans think being fat is good, unlike South Koreans who want to be skinny.

'There is a high chance Jong-un intentionally gained weight to look like Il-sung.'
