Mourners gathered in Harlem this morning to celebrate the life of famed soul food restaurant owner Sylvia Woods, who was remembered by famous patrons, neighbourhood locals, tourists, and friends as a welcoming trailblazer who turned her small eatery into a New York icon.

Former president Bill Clinton was one of many to pay tribute, saying in a moving eulogy: ‘When people came to see me from all over America and the world and wanted to know what Harlem was like, I sent them to Sylvia's, and they were made to feel welcome and at home.’

Mrs Woods died last week at the age of 86 after battling with Alzheimer’s disease, and ran Sylvia’s until she retired at the age of 80.

Paying tribute: Former President Bill Clinton spoke late in the funeral for Sylvia Woods, saying that he always sent those from out-of-town to Sylvia's Restaurant so they would feel 'welcome and at home'

Spreading Harlem to the world: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg also spoke during a public service for Sylvia Woods, praising her dedication to the Harlem community

New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg also spoke kind words of Mrs Wood, praising her dedication to Harlem as a community, and her charity.

'She brought the world to Harlem, and she made sure that the world took Harlem back home with them,' he said at the public service and wake at Abyssinian Baptist Church.

'That's the Sylvia we'll remember, and though they called her the Queen of Soul Food, it was her warmth, her grace and her generosity that truly made her royalty,' Mr Bloomberg said.

David Dinkins, who served as New York’s mayor in the early 90s, said Sylvia's Restaurant 'is more than a business; it is a testament to our tradition, a comfort zone, a home away from home.' 

He said her customers also were her neighbours 'who needed a place to celebrate special occasions or simply a place to enjoy friends over a great meal.'

He called Mrs Woods 'a friend, a mother, a grandmother, a matriarch of a community. She put her soul in the soul food.'

Institution: Sylvia's became a Harlem institution after opening its doors in 1962, founded by Mrs Sylvia Woods

Mrs Woods once said that her restaurant, with its purple awnings and flashing lights and located at 127th Street and Malcolm X Boulevard, is more than just a place to eat.

‘If you come alone, you’re never going to dine alone,’ she once said.

'She brought the world to Harlem, and she made sure that the world took Harlem back home with them.'

-New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg

The Rev Al Sharpton once said that Sylvia’s was ‘more than a restaurant, it has been a meeting place for black America.’

Food critic Gael Greene, a co-founder of the Citymeals-on-Wheels food delivery service, said that when she first went to Sylvia's in the late 1970s, 'it was not an era when downtowners coolly trekked up to Harlem for fun ... but off we went for glorious ribs and transcendent candied sweets, and there she was, a sweet-faced little woman in a rumpled apron, behind the counter, grinning.'

Mrs Woods and her husband, Herbert, natives of South Carolina who met as children, started Sylvia's in 1962.

The restaurant is a Harlem fixture, with tourists and locals going there for the traditional Southern food staples of cornbread, ribs, collard greens, and fried chicken.

The restaurant is also a magnate for politicians. President Barack Obama made frequent visits to the Harlem institution while on the campaign trail.

Mr Clinton also frequented the restaurant.

On Tuesday, mourners filed past an open casket. Mrs Woods was laid out in a cream-colored brocade suit. The altar was adorned with white flowers: roses, orchids and calla lilies.

A Harlem block was closed by barricades, with police keeping very tight security as a line-up of black limousines arrived for the service. A horse-drawn carriage took her casket in a procession to the restaurant.

Mourners arrived dressed in their Sunday best, many in black.

'She was our shining start,' said Audrey Quintano, who worked for Woods as her executive catering chef in the 1990s and is now preparing to open her own restaurant.

Ms Quintano said that 'Miss Sylvia' was her mentor and that Herbert and Sylvia Woods provided a wonderful example of a happy marriage. 'He would act as if he had just met her and he was 19,' Ms Quintano said. 'They were the perfect couple.'

Preparation: Police barricades are set out in front of Abyssinian Baptist Church ahead of Mrs Woods' funeral; the church is located in Harlem

Yvonne Maddox, a frequent customer and neighbourhood resident, said, 'I've known her 17 years.

'She inspired all of us, especially women. Running a business must not have been easy for a black lady 50 years ago and at the same time raising a beautiful family.'

From its start as a restaurant, Sylvia's has grown to include multiple cookbooks and a nationwide line of food products.

The restaurant marked its 50th anniversary in August. Mrs Woods officially stepped down from running the restaurant when she was 80, leaving it in the hands of her children and grandchildren. Herbert Woods died in 2001.

Another service is scheduled for Wednesday at Grace Baptist Church in Mount Vernon, where Woods lived, just north of New York City.

Saddened: Rev. Al Sharpton, centre, and Woods' family members gathered at a press conference inside Sylvia's on July 20th; he said the restaurant was a 'meeting place for black America'
