Amanda Knox and her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito hugged and kissed during a secret reunion in New York this week, it has emerged.

The former lovers were pictured strolling in New York on Tuesday - just hours after Italian judges ordered them to return to court for a retrial for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher

The tryst has already led to concerns that the couple should not be in contact with each other now they have been recalled for a re-trial.

As reported by the Daily Mirror, the 
pair were pictured hugging closely, with Knox closing her eyes during 
the warm embrace as Sollecito kissed her cheek. The meeting has led 
to rumours that the pair have become romantically involved again. James Terrano, who is reportedly Knox's boyfriend, was nowhere to be seen.

As the pair walked and chatted along a street in New York, Knox's mother walked behind.

One onlooker, speaking to the Daily Mirror, said the pair looked like a couple who had been together for sometime.

He said: 'You only have to look at him to see he still holds a huge torch for Amanda.

'They never once stopped chatting. 
It's astonishing they are allowed to even talk to each other, let along 
see one another, considering they are both suspects in a murder trial.'

Knox declined to comment on the reunion, with Sollecito admitting the pair have much to plan.

Hours before their secret reunion on Tuesday, Italy's high court faulted the acquittal of Knox and Sollecito by the 
appeals court for the murder of Miss Kercher.

The court ruled that the 21-year-old's death was a 'sex 
game gone wrong' and ordered the couple back for trial.

This has resulted in Sollecito launching a desperate $500,000 online appeal for donations to fund his retrial.

The
computer studies graduate said he was hard up and needed the cash for 
'legal expenses' but added anything raised above the target he would 
'donate to a research foundation'.

In an appeal posted on his Facebook page Sollecito wrote: 'Well Guys, the problem for me now is pretty tough.

'I'm deeply concerned not just for the issue I'm facing and most of you already know about, but also because I don't have resources anymore to fight this injustice.

'I badly need to be able to hire experts, when needed, or pay my attorney fees, documents fees, and so on when the new appeal will start.

'I hope to not bother you, but I need your collaboration to face this ordeal. Otherwise I don't want to forced to give up just for financial reason.

'I hope you will understand. I'm just asking if you, buddies, know how to build up a non-profit raising funds foundation. Big Hugs, Raffaele Sollecito.'

Sollecito is thought to have been paid $1 million for American TV news interviews and an advance on his book Honour Bound My Journey to Hell and Back with Amanda Knox, which was published last year.

However a sizeable proportion of that was swallowed up in legal fees to his team of lawyers including Italy's high flying Giulia Bongiorno who is said to have the highest fees in the country.

On his Facebook page he invites potential donors to help him out via a page called Gofundme.com and on it he adds: 'This new Trial will take other 6 or 7 years more with witnesses, transfers, documents, experts and everything will be discussed all over again.

'I'll use and certify all the expenses paid with this funds. If in the future, I will not need this funds anymore for legal expenses, I'll donate the rest of the funds to a research foundation. Please help.'

His urologist father Francesco Sollecito said: 'This is an initiative of Raffaele's but it has my full support. I'm no longer in a position to fund a trial which could last another two years.

'Witnesses will have to be reheard and there is a good chance that new forensic tests will have to be carried out and as such experts and consultants will have to be paid.

'We are both very grateful for the high attention that has been paid to this case by his lawyers Giulia Bongiorno and Luca Maori.'

As of early today, 31 people had donated with the largest amount being $1,000 from an anonymous donor and the total standing at more than $4,000 - at that pace he will have made his target by the time the trial starts.

The site was also subject to fierce criticism with several people posting comments expressing their outrage one woman Silvia Pavan wrote in Italian: 'Why don't you ask Amanda Knox for money ? Or better still why don't you kill yourself ??? Murderer.'

Another called Lucia Rossi said: 'Scandalous. A killer asking for money...where have we ended up.'

The Supreme Court on Tuesday said the ruling was full of 'deficiencies, contradictions and illogical' conclusions and ordered the new appeals court to look at all the evidence to determine whether Knox helped kill the teen.

In March, the Court of Cassation overturned Knox's acquittal in the 2007 murder of flatmate Meredith Kercher and ordered a new trial.

On Tuesday, the high court issued its written reasoning for doing so. Kercher's body was found in November 2007 in her bedroom of the house she shared with Knox in Perugia, a central Italian town popular with foreign exchange students.

Knox, now 25, and her Italian ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, 29, were initially convicted and sentenced to long prison terms, but a Perugia appeals court acquitted them in 2011, criticizing virtually the entire case mounted by prosecutors.

Decision: Italy's judges have ruled that the possibility that Meredith Kercher died during a sex game which went wrong needed to be looked at again

The appellate court noted that the murder weapon was never found, said that DNA tests were faulty and that prosecutors provided no murder motive.

A young man from Ivory Coast, Rudy Guede, was convicted of the slaying in a separate proceeding and is serving a 16-year sentence.

In the 74-page Cassation ruling, the high court judges said they 'had to recognize that he (Guede) was not the sole author' of the crime, Italian news agency LaPresse reported. The judges though said he was the 'main protagonist'.

They said the new appeal process would serve to 'not only demonstrate the presence of the two suspects in the place of the crime, but to possibly outline the subjective position of Guede's accomplices'.

It said hypotheses ran from a simple case of forced sex involving Kercher 'to a group erotic game that blew up and got out of control'.

The high court faulted the Perugia appeals court for 'multiple instances of deficiencies, contradictions and illogical' conclusions.

The new court must conduct a full examination of evidence to resolve the ambiguities, it said.

Knox and Sollecito denied wrongdoing and said they weren't even in the apartment that night, although they acknowledged they had smoked marijuana and their memories were clouded.

Miss Kercher was found semi naked and with her throat cut in the 
bedroom of the house she shared in the Italian hilltop town of Perugia 
with his American former girlfriend.

He
was given a 25 year jail term while Knox was given 26 years but in 2011
the verdicts were overturned and they were released on appeal.

However, three months ago Italy's highest court ruled there should be a fresh trial for both of them.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
