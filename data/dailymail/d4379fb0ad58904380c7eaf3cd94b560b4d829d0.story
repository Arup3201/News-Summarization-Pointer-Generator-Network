Britain’s new man in Brussels is set to be a Tory peer he seems to struggle to get David Cameron to listen to him.

Lord Hill – who once tried, and failed, to resign from the government - has been nominated as the UK's candidate to become European Commissioner.

But just three weeks when asked if he would take the job, he replied: ‘Non, non, non.’

Lord Hill insisted three weeks ago that he did not want the EU Commissioner job, but his name will be put to a summit in Brussels this week

Lord Hill had been Conservative Leader of the House of Lords but at a European Council summit he on Wednesday night his name will be put the EU's 28 national leaders .

The Prime Minister said he had picked the former education minister for his 'excellent combination of political and private sector experience'.

'Half his career has been spent in business, half in government at the highest levels, most recently doing an excellent job as leader of the House of Lords where he has proven a skilled negotiator respected by all parties,' he said.

'And having founded his own company, he also has a strong understanding of the private sector and how the EU can help businesses to generate growth and create jobs.'

However, the appointment attracted ridicule as it emerged Mr Cameron appeared to have ignored Lord Hill’s own misigivings, and not for the first time.

In 2012, he secured a meeting with the PM to tender his resignation. But instead of accepting – or protesting – Lord Hill’s decision, Mr Cameron reportedly told him to carry on his good work, and strode out of the room after being told he was late for a photocall. As a result, Lord Hill remained in post.

Then last month he appeared to rule himself out as a candidate for European Commissioner.

Asked if he wanted to go to Brussels, he told the Conservative Home website: 'Non, non, non.

‘First, I don't believe I'm going to be asked. Secondly, I like it here. I quite like it at home, in the British Isles.'

In a separate interview with PoliticsHome, Lord Hill also confessed: ‘I am not very good at thinking long term.’

Yet his role in Brussels could be key to Mr Cameron’s hopes of securing major reform of the EU, before Britain holds an in-out referendum in 2017.

The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘Sometimes in Brussels not being seen to campaign for jobs is an effective way to go about your business.’

Prime Minister David Cameron said Lord Hill has a strong understanding of the EU

Lord Hill worked in the Conservative Research Unit and as special adviser to Kenneth Clarke in the 1980s and served in the Number 10 Policy Unit 1991-2 and as political secretary to Prime Minister John Major.

The choice of Lord Hill, ahead of widely-mooted contenders including Andrew Lansley, Andrew Mitchell and William Hague, means that Mr Cameron avoids a potentially difficult by-election.

Lord Hill said he believed the UK should play 'a leading role in the EU'.

'The European Union faces two great challenges. First, how to spread growth and jobs across Europe. Second, how to strengthen public support in many countries for the European Union,' he said.

'The European Commission will have a vital role to play in delivering that change.

'So it's a huge responsibility to have the opportunity to play a part in reforming the EU but it is one that I am excited to have been offered. I look forward to working with Jean-Claude Juncker, other member states and the European Parliament to achieve this change.

'I also believe that the UK's interests are best served by playing a leading role in the EU, shaping the organisation as it changes to meet the challenges it now faces.

'In five years' time, when the next European elections take place, I want to be able to say to people across Europe - including Britain - that the European Commission has heeded their concerns and changed the EU for the better.'

A Cambridge history graduate, Jonathan Hill cut his teeth politically in the Conservative Research Department, joining in 1985 - two years before David Cameron trod the same path - having decided that a job in the City was not for him.

A big break came the following year when he landed a plum position as special adviser Ken Clarke, then newly promoted to employment minister in Margaret Thatcher's Cabinet, and going on to follow his new boss to postings at health and trade and industry.

After brief stint in PR, the rsie to power of John Major saw him return to the world of politics in 1991 with a job in the No 10 Policy Unit.

His next big break came on the eve of the 1992 general election when Mr Major chose him for the crucial post of political secretary.

He was at the prime minister's side throughout the campaign, and in the bitter parliamentary battles that followed with the Tory Eurosceptics over the ratification of the Maastricht treaty.

Terry Scuoler, chief executive of manufacturers' organisation EEF and chair of Ceemet, the organisation representing European manufacturing in Brussels, said: 'Lord Hill's nomination is a positive and diplomatic move.

'It is essential that he secures a key economic portfolio on behalf of the UK so that he can bring some rigour to economic reform and industrial revival in Brussels, with a focus on further trade deals and supportive and flexible social policies.’
