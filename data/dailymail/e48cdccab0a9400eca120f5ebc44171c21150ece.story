Louis van Gaal is a very wily man.

As soon as he made the decision to send on Tim Krul, the Costa Rican players would have started to think ‘this is unusual’ and wonder why he did it.

It would have been different had first-choice goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen limped off injured, but to make a change like that would have started to get them thinking Krul must be really good at saving penalties.

They would have begun to consider they need to be really careful when they are taking their spot kicks.

It’s not easy when you’re under pressure, when you’re under stress. And in a World Cup that pressure is intensified.

Partly that is about the billions watching around the world, but for those taking the penalty it is what their country will think - what their relatives and friends will think. They don’t want to let them down, that’s what hits them.

Van Gaal making such a surprising change just before such a high-stress event would have made it much worse for the Costa Ricans. They would have something else to think about. It would play on their minds. It was a clever move.

The Costa Ricans would not have known that Krul had only saved two of his last 20 penalties before the shootout. They would never have seen a substitution like this happen before, so they would be thinking it was because he is there to save penalties.

There is a second element to this, too. Krul wants to shine because he hasn’t played the rest of the tournament. 

For him this is an opportunity. It’s critical, it’s high stress, the world is watching and it was his manager saying: ‘I trust you, this is your moment.’ And he shone.
