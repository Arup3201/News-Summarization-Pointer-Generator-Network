Former New England Patriots player and accused murderer Aaron Hernandez has allegedly attacked a fellow inmate in a Massachusetts jail, according to reports.

Ever since his arrest over the summer, Hernandez has been kept apart from the general population at Bristol County House of Corrections.

But according to TMZ Sports, the former tight end was recently allowed to walk in an isolated hallway, where he encountered another inmate.

Violet skirmish: Former New England Patriots football player Aaron Hernandez allegedly beat up another inmate in a Massachusetts jail

High-profile case: Hernandez (left) is facing murder charges in the 2013 killing of semi-pro football player Odin Lloyd (right)

Hernandez allegedly lunged at the unnamed man and severely beat him up.

Sources told the gossip site that Hernandez's alleged victim had been harassing the former football player, and the two men had been feuding all day prior to the attack.

Hernandez faces murder charges in connection to the 2013 killing of semi-professional football player Odin Llyod.

He was arrested June 26, 2013, and kept in solitary confinement due to the high profile of the case.

Most recently, a Massachusetts judge imposed a formal gag order to protect the ex-New England Patriot's right to a fair trial.

Earlier this month, Hernandez's attorneys had accused the state of allowing leaks and prejudicial out-of-court statements.

They claimed the prosecution orchestrated a ‘publicity stunt’ last year when Miami Dolphin Michael Pouncey was served with a subpoena after a game at Gillette Stadium. Prosecutors denied that and say they have leaked nothing.

Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to the murder of semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd.

The ex-NFL player has pleaded not guilty to murder in the shooting death of Lloyd, a 27-year-old Boston man who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee.

Lloyd was found dead June 17, 2013, near Hernandez's North Attleborough home.

Mr Hernandez is being held without bail at the Dartmouth jail. He is due back in court June 16.
