A cowboy builder has been jailed after scamming an 82-year-old pensioner out of nearly a quarter of a million pounds.

Sam Smith, 31, carried out unnecessary repairs on Leslie Halford's house in Northfield, Birmingham, over a two-year period.

He charged a staggering £225,000 for the work - causing the pensioner to part with his life savings and become dependent on borrowing money.

Meanwhile, his brother Michael, 40, conned another man, Kenneth Cook, into believing his roof was on the verge of collapsing.

Mr Cook, who is believed to be in his 50s, forked out £22,350 for the building work on his house in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands.

Both of the victims lived alone and were cold-called by the younger brother, Birmingham Crown Court heard.

The brothers were caught out after Mr Halford's concerned bank manager contacted Birmingham Trading Standards.

Case: Sam Smith was sentenced to five years and four months in prison after pleading guilty to seven counts of fraud at Birmingham Crown Court (pictured). His older brother was imprisoned for two years and seven months

Sam Smith has now been jailed for five years and four months after pleading guilty to seven counts of fraud, while his brother, Michael, has been sentenced to two years and seven months in prison.

Mark Jackson, prosecuting, said Mr Halford, a bachelor who had lived alone for 40 years, had passed away before his tormenters were brought to justice.

He added that Sam Smith's work on the pensioner's home was 'completely pointless, completely worthless - it’s just a con.'

'For two years he milked Mr Halford for every penny he had in the world,' he said.

'Mr Halford spent his life’s savings effectively paying Sam Smith. He had had to borrow in the end when all his own money ran out.'

Mr Jackson said that if the work had been necessary, Smith’s fee should have been worth little more than £20,000.

Sentencing the pair, Recorder Edward Coke said: 'I can’t describe this as anything other than despicable.'

He told Sam Smith it must have been obvious Mr Halford was in his 80s - adding: 'I’ve come to the conclusion this was planned, systematic befriending of an elderly gentleman, who you knew lived on his own.

'Mr Halford welcomed the attention, welcomed the company and welcomed the persistent kindness he thought he was getting.

'This is the worst sort of deceit in my judgement.'
