Ed Miliband is coming under intense pressure from his MPs to sack Ed Balls to boost Labour’s prospects in next year’s General Election.

The whispering campaign against the Shadow Chancellor has started as Mr Balls fights an increasingly open battle with health spokesman Andy Burnham over their manifesto policies.

The group, who are largely affiliated to the unions, are swinging behind Mr Burnham’s call for the party to back a ring-fenced tax to boost funding for the NHS – a move that Mr Balls categorically ruled out yesterday.

The MPs resent Mr Balls’s refusal to pledge extra money to the NHS in case the Tories cite it as an example of Labour’s profligacy. 

The MPs have grown concerned by the party’s failure to open up a commanding opinion poll lead over the Conservatives, with some recent surveys showing a gap down to just two per cent.

No opposition party in recent political history has won Downing Street from such a weak electoral position.

With just ten months until the Election, most of the MPs accept that a direct challenge to Mr Miliband is now unlikely, and so many have instead started calling for Mr Balls’s head as part of a wider Shadow Cabinet reshuffle which would promote Mr Burnham and see a return for former Chancellor Alistair Darling and ex-Home Secretary Alan Johnson.

The tension between Mr Burnham and Mr Balls erupted yesterday when Mr Balls slapped down the idea of either a 15 per cent ‘death tax’ levy on all estates to pay for social care of the elderly or an extra 1p on National Insurance as an ‘NHS tax’, both of which are understood to have the support of Mr Burnham.

‘People feel they are paying too much tax already,’ said Mr Balls. ‘We have to get the balance right between balancing the budget and making sure the NHS continues to deliver.’

Mr Miliband has promised a ‘summer offensive’ of major speeches by his frontbench team to build momentum into the autumn conference season. 

But many of his MPs were mortified when he used a speech last month to draw attention  to his supposed resemblance to Wallace from the Wallace and Gromit series, saying he was ‘not from central casting’. 

Last night, Labour MP Graham Stringer led calls for a wide-ranging frontbench reshuffle after next month’s Scottish referendum. He told The Mail on Sunday: ‘There needs to be a Shadow Cabinet reshuffle before the Labour party conference. After Scotland votes No to independence he [Miliband] should bring back Alistair Darling, who led the anti-independence campaign, and [former Home Secretary] Alan Johnson. Both of them have bags of experience, which our frontbench lacks. We also need to match the Tories’ new- found focus and drive.’

Mr Stringer added: ‘I cannot bear all this angst about jawlines and Wallace and Gromit. The public don’t want self-absorption. They want a focus on tough, clear policies that are relevant to their lives. 

‘My view that things need to change is shared throughout the party. The only division is between those who think the debate should take place in private and the few of us who want it to take place in public.’

And Grahame Morris, Labour MP for Easington, who is understood to support the sacking of Mr Balls, said: ‘I want to see Labour adopting bold policies to tackle the cost of living crisis, reverse the privatisation of the NHS and be ambitious in building a million affordable homes.’

Asked whether he thought  Mr Balls should be sacked, Mr Morris said: ‘The choice of the Shadow Cabinet is a matter  for the leader.’
