Brockovich, who was famously portrayed by Julia Roberts in a movie about her life, said she is frightened of going to jail over the arrest

'I'm embarrassed, to say the least - humiliated. And not about the photo,' Brockovich said in the interview with Couric. 'I made a bad choice and a mistake and I'm very sorry for it.'

Brockovich, who was famously portrayed by Julia Roberts in a movie about her life, said she is frightened of going to jail over the arrest and that her lawyer thinks she will just have to pay a fine.

On the night of the incident, arresting officer Kasen Haslem reported that she appeared 'highly intoxicated' as she argued with her husband,Â  Eric L. Ellis, aboard a boat docked at the Las Vegas Boat Harbor on Lake Mead. The mother of three later registered a blood alcohol content of .190 - more than twice the legal limit of .08.

Haslem was fueling up his own boat when he spotted the couple around 7:30 p.m.

'I watched as she threw a cell phone form the boat into the water,' he wrote. 'She then walked by her husband and she appeared to slap him.'

Explaining her haggard mugshot, Brockovich said she had recently gotten plastic surgery under her eyes and that the red marks which appear in the photo are a result of the surgery

Explaining the fight with her husband to Couric, Brockovich said she was cleaning up bottles in the cabin under the boat when, unbeknownst to her, her husband fell in the water.

When she came up from the cabin, she said she was surprised to see that he was soaking wet and he was angry she hadn't helped him when he fell in the water.

'Our voices are raised at that point because he was irritated and then I was irritated,' she said. That's when she threw her phone in the water, she added.

'It was a very quick husband-wife, 15-years-being-married kind of [fight] like, "Why are you yelling at me?"' she explained.

Brockovich also explained why her mugshot was so unflattering. She said she had recently gotten plastic surgery under her eyes and that the red marks which appear in the photo are a result of the surgery.

Pressed by Couric, she vehemently denied that she has a drinking problem.

'Oh no, I don't. I absolutely do not,' she said.

In arresting documents, Haslem stated that Brockovich's answers to his questions were 'very slurred.'

'She also kept straying from the conversation and repeating herself,' he wrote in a police report, adding, 'I could also smell an alcoholic beverage on her breath.'

Haslem performed field sobriety tests
 and she failed nearly every one of them, he said. She was later booked 
into jail and released on a $1,000 bail.

Brockovich has since apologized for 
her arrest in a written statement, but her interview with Couric is the first time she has talked about it publicly.

Under Nevada law, a first-time offense of boating while intoxicated is a
 misdemeanor that draws fines from $1,000 to $2,000 but no jail time. 
Authorities were unsure whether it was Brockovich's first arrest on the 
charge.

Brockovich, who married her third 
husband, Eric L. Ellis, in 1999, became a worldwide celebrity after the 
2000 Steven Soderbergh film about her life.

As a legal assistant she helped win a 
record $333 million settlement from a power company after dozens of 
people were poisoned by chemicals released into the water supply in the 
California town of Hinkley.

After suffering an injury in an auto 
accident, Brokovich hired the California law firm Masry and Vititoe to 
represent her in a civil lawsuit against the other driver. While the 
firm won her a small settlement, the single mother needed a job to 
support her family.

The law firm hired Brokovich as a 
file clerk, which is what ultimately launched the former Miss Pacific 
Coast's career in law and public advocacy.

While organizing files for a pro-bono
 real estate case, Brokovich uncovered medical records that would lead 
to the largest settlement ever paid out in a direct action lawsuit in 
U.S. history.

Brokovich's investigation found that 
the Pacific Gas and Electric company had been poisoning Hinkley 
residents for more than 30 years.

Between 1952 and 1966, the company 
used the chemical hexavalent chromium (often referred to as Cr-6) to 
fight corrosion in the cooling tower in the Hinkley compressor, which 
was part of a natural gas pipeline connecting much of northern 
California to the San Francisco Bay area.

The waste water dissolved the Cr-6 and it ended up in unlined ponds near the cooling tower.

The Cr-6 then found its way into the groundwater, contaminating a two-by-one-mile area around the plant.

Because of Brokovich's research, more than 600 Hinklley residents shared the giant $333 million settlement.

For her work, Brokovich was given a $2 million bonus.

Julia Roberts won a Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal of Brockovich in the self-titled movie about the case.

Brokovich and Masry then became the 
face of environmental litigation and went on to file several lawsuits 
against various corporations for pollution issues.

Since the film, Brockovich has become a high profile campaigner and TV star with her own series, 'Final Justice.'

Just last year, Brockovich was back 
on the big screen in the documentary 'Last Call at the Oasis,' which 
explores challenges related to the planet's dwindling and increasingly 
polluted water supply.
