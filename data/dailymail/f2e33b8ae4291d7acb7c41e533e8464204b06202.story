A worker in the Connecticut medical examiner's office is now under investigation after it was revealed that she took her husband to view the body of Sandy Hook school gunman Adam Lanza days after he murdered 27 people before taking his own life.

The woman, a technician at the state medical examiner's office, reportedly allowed her husband to see Lanza's body two days after the horrific school massacre on December 14.

The Hartford Courant identified the woman as Jean Henry.

Killer: Lanza slaughtered 20 children and six adults in one of America's worst ever school shootings just before Christmas

After Lanza's body was removed from the school, it was kept in a refrigerated area at the medical examiner's compound in Farmington where an autopsy was performed.

But before that, Henry allegedly went inside the room - with her husband in tow - unzipped the body bag and allowed him to get a good look.

Sources told the paper that Henry's husband does not work at the state, and her supervisor was aware that he had been there.

Neither Henry - who was placed on administrative leave - nor Chief Medical Examiner H. Wayne Carver III would comment when reached by the Courant.

Lanza
forced his way into the elementary school less than two weeks before Christmas - 
killing 20 first-grade children in their classrooms and six adults. He 
then shot himself in the head.

It
was later found that Lanza's first victim had been his own mother Nancy
Lanza, who was shot multiple times in her home as she laid in bed.

Earlier this week, it was revealed that Lanza's body had been claimed for a private burial by his father, Peter Lanza, who had divorced his mother several years ago and was living with his new wife in Stamford, Connecticut.

Police have not offered a motive for the killings.

Peter Lanza works in financial services with General Electric and has finally claimed the body of his son Adam Lanza who committed the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre on December 14th

Scientists were asked to study Lanza's DNA to see if
has an 'evil' gene that led him to carry out the massacre.

The study,
which will look at any abnormalities or mutations in his individual DNA, is
believed to be the first of its kind ever carried out on a mass murderer.The
massacre prompted President Obama to look into new gun controls and banning
assault rifles such as AR-15 Bushmaster used by Lanza in his rampage.

The study
of the killer's DNA was been ordered by Carver - who carried out the post-mortems on all the victims.

He has
contacted geneticists at University of Connecticut's to conduct the study.

Geneticists
said they are likely looking at Lanza's DNA to detect a mutation or abnormality
that could increase the risk of aggressive or violent behavior.

They could
analyse Lanza's entire genome in great detail and try to find any unexpected
mutations.

Arthur
Beaudet, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine, said the University of
Connecticut geneticists are most likely trying to 'detect clear
abnormalities of what we would call a mutation in a gene'.

He added: 'Or gene abnormalities and there are some abnormalities that are related
to aggressive behavior.

'They
might look for mutations that might be associated with mental illnesses and
ones that might also increase the risk for violence.

Beaudet,
who is also the chairman of Baylor College of Medicine's department of
molecular and human genetics in Houston, Texas said geneticists should be doing
this type of research because there are 'some mutations that are known to
be associated with at least aggressive behavior if not violent behavior.'

'I
don't think any one of these mutations would explain all of (the mass
shooters), but some of them would have mutations that might be causing both
schizophrenia and related schizophrenia violent behavior,' Beaudet said.

'I think we could learn more about it and we should learn more about
it.'

Beaudet,who
is chairman of the Baylor College department of molecular and human genetics,
said studying the genes of murderers is controversial because there is a risk
that those with similar genetic characteristics could possibly be discriminated
against or stigmatized.

But he said
the research into Lanza would be helpful even if only a "fraction"
may have the abnormality or mutation.

'Not
all of these people will have identifiable genetic abnormalities,' Beaudet
told ABC News in America.

'By
studying genetic abnormalities we can learn more about conditions better and
who is at risk and what might be dramatic treatments,' Beaudet said,
adding if the gene abnormality is defined the 'treatment to stop'
other mass shootings or 'decrease the risk is much approved.'

Although
known to be shy and social inept Lanza had not shown any violent streak
although he was known to spend hours in the basement of his home playing
violent video games.
