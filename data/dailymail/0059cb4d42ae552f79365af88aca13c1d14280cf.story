Having wanted a piglet her whole life, Catherine Dawes was thrilled to buy what she thought was a micro-pig for her 50th birthday. 

After paying over £500 for the tiny animal, Ms Dawes from Blantyre, Lanarkshire, never expected to see it grow bigger than a small dog.

But three years later, pet pig Dudley weighs over 20 stone, and measures 5ft 8in from nose to curly tail.

When Mrs Dawes bought Dudley she didn't expect him to grow past two stone

Ms Dawes and her partner, Colin, travelled to Nottingham to pick up Dudley after a breeder had assured them he was what they were looking for. 

'I've loved pigs since I was young and always said I was going to get one. So when I spotted an advert for micro pigs, I thought that would be perfect, he could live with us like a dog,' said Ms Dawes.

Dudley is fully house trained and enjoys cuddling up to watch TV with his owner

Micro pigs are fully grown at two years old and weigh just two stone. So as Dudley continued to get bigger and bigger, it didn't take long for Ms Dawes to realise she'd been duped by the breeder.

'When we picked him up he was about nine weeks old and a bit bigger than I was expecting, but we saw his mother and she was pretty small. Obviously the dad must have been a lot bigger!

Dudley as a piglet: After Ms Dawes bought the pig as a 50th birthday treat, she thought he would remain a small size forever. But as time went on she began to realise he wasn't a micro pig after all

'We thought Dudley had reached full-size when he got level with the coffee table, but he kept getting bigger.

'Now, he comes up to my waist! I'm not sure of his exact weight but he must be at least 20 stone.

'He's certainly heavy. He stood on my toe the other week and it was black and blue!

'At first we were shocked by his growth, but we're used to it now.

"We did contact the breeder when we realised he wasn't 'micro' but we never got a response.

'It's probably just as well because by then we were too attached to part with him.

Dudley, who is fully house trained, stays in the house during the day and sleeps in a coal shed in the garden at night, complete with a straw bed and heat lamp.

Once she realised Dudley wasn't a micro pig after all, Ms Dawes contacted the dishonest breeder but received no response

Dexter, the household dog, has been feeling left out as Dudley attracts so much attention when stood out in the front garden

The pampered pig enjoys 'cuddling in and lying in front of the TV'. His favourite thing to eat are bananas, but he enjoys scoffing all types of fruit and veg.

Dudley has made an unlikely friend in Dexter, the family's bichon frise.

'He's fully house trained, can give you a trotter when you ask and closes doors behind him.

Though Ms Dawes and her Dexter are used to her unusual companion, Dudley still causes quite a stir around town.

'People think we're crazy having a huge pig in the house, but everyone who meets Dudley is smitten.

Despite his surprising growth, Dudley is part of the family says Ms Dawes

'We used to put him out in the front garden, but we'd have lines of school buses stopping outside and cars nearly crashing as the drivers were too busy looking at this huge pig running around,' she laughed.

'Now, he sticks to the back - but we still have people asking if they can meet our pet pig.

'Most have heard he loves bananas and bring a bunch along.

'The only thing we need to be wary of is shoelaces. He likes to chew them so you might end up with him accidentally nibbling your leg.

'But other than that he's a big friendly giant.'
