The last moments of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin on camera were released today, showing the Florida teen wearing a hoodie and purchasing the last snacks he would ever buy.

Surveillance video from the Sanford 7-Eleven shows the teen in a grey hoodie and long khaki trousers, first looking through the aisles and then paying for his bag of Skittles and Arizona iced tea.

The chilling video was taken before Martin returned to the gated community in which Martin’s father lives and was gunned down by George Zimmerman.

The surveillance video is the last bit of evidence that has been released by Special Prosecutor Angela Corey, who has also published a collection of documents and photos of Zimmerman taken the night of the shooting.

Among the massive amounts of evidence are nearly 200 pages of documents, including photos and eyewitness accounts, that show Zimmerman and Martin were in a loud and blood fight in the moments leading up to the shooting, and that Zimmerman appeared to be getting the worst of it, with wounds to both his face and the back of his head.

According to statements made by Martin’s girlfriend, who was on the phone with the teen the night of February 26, his last words were: ‘Get off, get off.’

His cell phone then cut off and Martin was shot, his girlfriend said in the interview with a prosecutor.

But the original lead detective in the case believed Zimmerman caused the fight by getting out of his vehicle to confront Martin, who wasn't doing anything criminal, and then could have defused the situation by telling Martin he was just a concerned citizen and tried to talk to him.

He didn't think Zimmerman could legally invoke Florida's 'stand your ground' law and should be charged with manslaughter.

Under that law, people are given wide latitude to use deadly force rather than retreat in a fight if they believe they are in danger of being killed or seriously injured, they weren't committing a crime themselves and are in a place they have the legal right to be.

The original prosecutor in the case accepted Zimmerman's invocation of the law after the February 26 shooting but a special prosecutor rejected his claim last month and charged Zimmerman with second-degree murder.

The former neighbourhood watch volunteer has pleaded not guilty, has been released on bail and reportedly is in hiding.

He and his attorney will have two more chances to invoke the law. First, they will try to convince a judge during what will be a mini-trial. If the judge agrees, the charges will be dropped although prosecutors could appeal. That is likely months away.

If the judge rejects the claim, Zimmerman could they try to convince the jury and win an acquittal. A trial is unlikely to start before next year. Zimmerman's attorney, Mark O'Mara, didn't return a phone call seeking comment Thursday from The Associated Press.

Speaking Friday on NBC's Today show, Mr O'Mara said he couldn't talk about the individual pieces of evidence in the case. But he said that rather than talking about the 'what-if's' — as in what if Zimmerman had stayed in the car — O'Mara said 'we have to deal with what happened and try to explain that.'

Joelle Moreno, a Florida International University law school professor, said the evidence now released makes it difficult to predict if a 'stand your ground' defence will work. She is a member of a state senator's task force examining the law.

Zimmerman also sent a letter from prison in response to an Ohio man who contacted him about where to donate money.

Zimmerman responded in the letter: ‘The best way to send your support is through prayer!’ he wrote, adding: ‘If you insist on sending funds, the best way is through my website.’

He said that his site, therealgeorgezimmerman.com ‘accepts checks and credit card payments via PayPal.’ 

The overall tone seemed upbeat, as he wrote: ‘This will all work out for me in the future’ and that he had ‘given my burden to the Lord and he has blessed me with tremendous patience.’

Martin, meanwhile, had drugs in his system the night he was shot and killed, a medical report has revealed. The autopsy on the 17-year-old showed traces of THC, which is found in marijuana, in the teenager's blood and urine.

Martin was killed by a single gunshot wound to the chest fired from 'intermediate range'. Self-appointed neighbourhood watchman George Zimmerman is on trial for the teenager's murder in Florida.

New pictures also support the gunman's claim that he was injured in a fight with the teenager, as he is shown with a swollen - possibly broken - nose and bleeding profusely from his head.

An autopsy report seen by NBC News claimed Martin also had broken skin on his left ring ringer below the knuckle. 

The report, prepared by the medical examiner in Volusia County, follows a separate medical examination on Zimmerman which found he had black eyes, a nose fracture and two cuts to the back of his head a day after the fatal shooting on February 26.

The report from Zimmerman's doctor at Altamonte Family Practice bolstered the 28-year-old's claims that he was being punched and pummeled by the unarmed teen when he opened fire in a gated community in Sanford, Florida.

Zimmerman, who is charged with murder in the killing, claims he acted in self-defense and only shot Trayvon when the teen saw the pistol he was carrying and reached for it.

It was then, Zimmerman said, he drew the gun himself and pulled the trigger.

On Tuesday, ABC News obtained a medical report from Zimmerman's family, who examined the neighborhood watch volunteer the day after the shooting. Zimmerman wanted to be checked out so he could be cleared to return to work.

Zimmerman, 28, told his doctor he was troubled by what happened the night before, saying he experienced 'occasional nausea when thinking about the violence.'

The doctor said it was 'imperative' that Zimmerman go to a psychologist he had been seeing to be examined. It's unknown what Zimmerman had sought counseling for in the past.

Before the shooting, Zimmerman had been prescribed Adderall, a common psycho-stimulant used treat ADHD, and Temazepam, a sleeping medication.

Both drugs cause agitation and mood swings as side effects, though they occur in fewer than 10 percent of patients.

Zimmerman claims he followed Trayvon, who was wearing a hoodie, when he saw him walking through the gated community when Zimmerman lives.

Trayvon, who was staying at his father's girlfriend's condo, was returning home after buying at snack.

Zimmerman followed the teen in his car and called 911. He then got out of his car, despite the emergency dispatcher saying he didn't need to continue pursuit.

Zimmerman claims that's when Trayvon approached him and threatened him. He told police the teen started the fight by punching in him the face.

A national uproar resulted in protests across the country after police declined to arrest Zimmerman. Protestors and Trayvon's parents say he was targeted for being black and the Zimmerman went free because he is not black.

Zimmerman was later charged with murder by a special prosecutor who was appointed by Florida Gov Rick Scott.

Zimmerman is currently free after posting $150,000 bail. He is currently in hiding after receiving 'thousands' of death threats.
