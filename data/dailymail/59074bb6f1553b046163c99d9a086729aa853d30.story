It may look a little more modest than some modern-day festive displays, but these black and white photographs give a charming insight into the way Christmas was celebrated in London through the 1950s, 60s and 70s.

This unique collection offers a glimpse into the festive season around Regent Street, St Paul's Cathedral, Trafalgar Square and other areas of the capital.

The shots were taken by freelance photographer Henry Grant over a period of 30 years and bought, alongside around 80,000 others, by the Museum of London in the 1980s.

The photograph shows Regent Street, central London, in 1954, a part of Henry Grant's collection

Not much has changed: Regent Street hasn't transformed itself a great deal in the last 60 years

Trafalgar Square had this Christmas tree, a gift from Norway, situated in front of the National Gallery in 1958

The Trafalgar Square tree, shown here in 1955, has been a gift to London from Oslo, Norway, since 1947

Trafalgar Square has retained its festive look into the 21st century (2005 tree pictured)

The collection, which was released today by the museum, includes a picture of a busy Regent Street at night in 1954, complete with old-fashioned cars and a number of classic Routemaster buses.

There are also two pictures of the Trafalgar Square Christmas tree, one in 1958, the other three years earlier, gifted to London from Oslo, the capital of Norway.

In addition, Mr Grant took pictures of children celebrating Christmas in their schools across the city, and others getting excited about toys inside Hamleys.

Demonstrating just how easy modern-day families have it at Christmas, the collection also includes pictures of flimsy Christmas trees being sold on a market and fully-feathered turkeys on sale at Leadenhall Market in 1957.

This shot shows Regent Street in 1948 looking slightly more modest around Christmas than it would in 2013

They may have been a little cheaper, but these Christmas trees, seen being purchased in 1957, would not satisfy many modern families

Mr Grant also captured a fantastic shot of the interior of St Paul's Cathedral in 1960.

The images have been released to mark
the opening of the Museum of London's Docklands’ Santa Grotto, which 
opened to the public today.

The museum has reconstructed a Victorian version of Wapping and is offering children the opportunity to meet Father Christmas in Sailortown.

The photographer caught this image from the inside of St Paul's Cathedral in December 1960

St Paul's was also decorated with Christmas trees for the festive period in 2012

The set is complete with winding cobbled streets, a lodging house, shops and even a wild animal emporium.

Sharon
Ament, director of the Museum of London, said: ‘The amazing diversity 
of London means that, all year round, the city is celebrating. But at 
Christmas, the capital glows like no other time of year.

‘These photographs remind us that when 25 December approaches, Londoners know how to embrace the festive spirit.’

The photographs were taken by freelance Fleet Street photographer Mr Grant over a period of 30 years.

Born in 1907, he did much of his street photography in between assignments.

The Museum of London bought Mr Grant’s archive, which contains a total of more than 80,000 black and white photographs, in 1986.
