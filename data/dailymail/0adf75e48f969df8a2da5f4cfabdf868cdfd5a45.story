TV news helicopter pilot Zoey Tur has completed her sex change to join Inside Edition as America's first transgender reporter.

Tur, formerly known as Chopper Bob, became famous for filming a mob beating driver Reginald Denny during the LA Riots, and the O.J. Simpson car chase.

Following 14 months of hormone treatment Tur  underwent successful sexual reassignment surgery in June 2014, transitioning from male to female.

Tur is now ready to go back on screen and will be the programme's Special Correspondent for the month of February.

'There's diversity in nature, so why not the media? I want to thank INSIDE EDITION for their support in what's shaping up to be America's last civil rights fight,' says Tur. 

The 54-year-old from Santa Monica, who has two children, decided to begin the change in 2013 and said that once the process was complete 'Bob must die' to make way for Zoey.

She said she was 'done hiding', after starting to push family and friends away and had suffered from body dysmorphic disorder.

Family and friends were supportive of the Tur's decision, although she said that for some it felt like grieving as they prepared to say goodbye to Bob.

'For the most part, people didn't know. They were in a state of shock initially,' she told CBS Los Angeles.

'My kids were in a state of shock. And they have been going through this mourning process. Bob Tur has got to die. And that's going to happen within the next three or four months.'

Going through the transitional period 'has not been easy' Tur said, adding she had been worried how it would affect her children including daughter, Katy, who is a reporter on NBC Nightly News.

Tur, who married fellow reporter Marika Gerrard at age 23 and has dated Carrie Fisher, has more than 10,000 flying hours over war zones and riots.

She said in 2013 the hormone therapy had already affected the way she flew, adding that her thought pattern had become more analytical than instinctive.

She said that she planned to have surgery to make her face more feminine and to have sexual reassignment surgery.

In an interview with TMZ she said: 'Transgender people really are misunderstood. It's not what you think'.

The pilot says she has had a female brain since birth, but struggled to come to terms with who she is.  

'It's a genetic disorder that happens in utero. Nobody knows exactly why, but you're born with a female or feminized brain,' she said.

'If you don't really know who you are. You think you're a woman, but you're a man.' 

Tur helped capture images of truck driver Reginald Denny being beaten during the LA riots

The pilot was also there to get footage of OJ Simpson's car chase in June 1994
