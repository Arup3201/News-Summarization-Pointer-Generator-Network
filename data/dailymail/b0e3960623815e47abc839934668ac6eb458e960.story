The owner of a corgi has captured on camera the friendship between her dog and a tiny baby bunny.

The corgi, Ripley, met the little rabbit one day while she was out walking with her owner, Lareina Tan.

After that, whenever Ripley left the house in West Lafayette, Indiana, for a walk, the bunny would pop up, ready to play.

No fear: The bunny jumped onto Ripley's paw as she lay in the grass

Unlikely friendship: Dog and bunny take a turn together around the residential street where Ripley lives with her owner

'This has happened two days in a row. We'd take the corgi out to potty, and she'd go sniffing around. Bunny pops out, play-date starts,' Tan wrote on Reddit.

'I was lucky enough to have my phone on me the third time this happened.'Â 

Tan was slightly concerned her dog, who is named after Ellen Ripley from the Hollywood movie Alien, might hurt the rabbit, but realized after watching the pair that she had no intention of injuring her new playmate.

'The bunny ran around in circles around us instead of away, and jumped onto Ripley's front paw while she was sitting. I want to believe the bunny chose to hang with her,' wrote Tan.

Instincts: A terrier bred for hunting might have attacked a tiny bunny like this, but Ripley the corgi just wants to play

Thumper: The bunny bounds along happily beside Ripley

Out for a stroll: The cute pair look perfectly at ease in each other's company as they scamper about together

Believe it or not: Ripley was named after Sigourney Weaver's character in the Alien films

Corgis are of Welsh origin, trained to herd animals. They're reportedly one of the few breeds that can herd geese.

Perhaps Ripley's herding instincts were at work as she rounded the bunny up off the road and towards the sidewalk.

Leap of faith: Ripley looks around for the bunny after jumping up onto the curb

Gentle nudge: The corgi seems to be trying to encourage the bunny to jump up onto the sidewalk with her

This cute encounter could have had a different outcome if the tiny bunny had met a different dog.

'Ripley is pretty much one of the least threatening dogs around... it could be because she grew up with a huge bunny and a hamster,' wrote Tan.

The bunny hopped off after Tan called Ripley inside, but she doesn't think that's the last Ripley will see of the rabbit.

Tan hopes that as the rabbit grows older, it will build its nest nearby so that Ripley and her new mate can maintain their friendship - and she can take more cute photos.
