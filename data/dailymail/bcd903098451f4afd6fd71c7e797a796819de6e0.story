In the weeks following Christmas, thousands of children across Britain sat down to write thank you letters to friends and family kind enough to give them a present.

But parents at one primary school were left fuming after they discovered their children had been told to do the complete opposite and complain about the gifts they received.

Children as young as seven were asked by teachers to write a letter of complaint to Father Christmas about their 'rubbish' presents.

Ungrateful: Children at a school in Kent were told to write a letter to Father Christmas, complaining about their presents

Pupils in years three and four at Green Park Community Primary School in Dover, Kent, were told to 'use adjectives' to describe their shoddy gifts and how they felt when they tore off the wrapping paper. 

Children were instructed to use 'metaphors and personification' to get a gold award for their work, while all children were told to tell Father Christmas what they expected him to do about it.

Some, including Charlotte Balfe's nine-year-old daughter Summer, were told do the task as homework. Summer did the homework reluctantly as she was worried she would 'get into trouble' if she did not.

Mrs Balfe said: 'My little girl did this homework as she was worried about getting told off by the school. I think it was wrong they were given it to do though.'  

Other furious parents took to Facebook to vent their anger at the posts.

Headmaster Richard Hawkins did not apologise for the assignment, calling it a 'bit of a misunderstanding'

Tisha Fullbrook said: 'My kids school homework is that this week! Mine ain't doing it!' 

Carolanne Kemp added: 'My son wont be doing this homework, i teach him to be grateful for what he's given not complain about it as other children are not so fortunate.

'Not to mention the fact that his dad worked bloody hard including working overtime to make sure he had a brilliant christmas only for him to be told to write a letter complaining about what he got... i dont think so!!' 

Richard Hawkins, the headteacher of the 265-pupil school rated 'Good' by Ofsted, said the homework was not meant to cause offence.

He said: 'Lots of the children understood what the home work was about - writing a letter of complaint.

'We chose Santa as they are used to writing letters to Santa.'

He added: 'Some parents said they didn't want their child to complain about presents. We took that feedback and reacted quickly to it.

'It led to engaging families and discussions with the parents which is always good.

'It's a little bit of a misunderstanding. We have a fantastic record with homework.'

The task young children were asked to complete was as follows:
