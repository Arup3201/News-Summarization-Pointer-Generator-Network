Buying dancing shoes is, as every woman knows, a very fiddly process. Scientific, almost.

It's about selecting a gorgeous model which allows movement, provides stability, and is forgiving enough for you to still be standing after eight hours beneath a disco ball.

And if anyone is aware of how complex a process this is, it's those Christmas angels at John Lewis Stratford City, who have formulated a 'try before you buy' plan - namely, a changing room in which you can test your party shoe shortlist to music - and named it Boogie Shoes.

'With our Fashion Advisors on hand, 
ladies will find the perfect pair of shoes that allows them to dance the
night away whilst also making a fabulous style statement'

A spokesman said: 'The John Lewis Fashion Advisers will be on hand to ensure each customer has the perfect Cinderella fit and to offer help with finding the right pair of shoes to complement an outfit.

'Customers can then test their choice on an exclusive dance floor in the Fashion Advice Suite. With music to set the mood, customers can have a boogie to ensure feet are prepped for parties while also testing out a selection of fabulous shoes to find the pair that will last the night.'

Thanks to John Lewis' new Boogie Shoes suite, you can shop for your Christmas party clobber, then test the dance durability of the shoes you want to wear before even buying them

Diane Knight, Women's Shoes Buyer, at John Lewis Stratford City said: 'London’s East End has seen the world's biggest party with the Olympics and Paralympics positioned right on its doorstep.

'Looking forward to Christmas, the British public are itching to continue the celebrations. As women get dance floor ready, we thought it would be great to encourage shoppers to join in on the party.

'With our Fashion Advisors on hand, ladies will find the perfect pair of shoes that allows them to dance the night away whilst also making a fabulous style statement.'
