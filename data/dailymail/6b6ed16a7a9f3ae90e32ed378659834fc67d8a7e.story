She went in to remove her wisdom teeth.

But a heavily drugged Jayci Underwood appeared to be an emotional wreck when she apparently realized the operation had not transformed her into Nicki Minaj.

Filmed by her husband Matt, the 23-year-old wailed that she 'paid so much money' but still awoke with the same figure.

Devastated: Jayci Underwood, 23, appeared to be inconsolable when she found she didn't have Nicki Minaj's butt after surgery on her wisdom teeth. Her husband Matt filmed the video in the dentist waiting room 

'I just want her butt,' she moaned as she dabbed her bleeding tongue with a tissue.

'And her face,' she added.

'I just love Nicki Minaj and I wanted to look like her.'

That wasn't Jayci's only disappointment.

'And you know what else? Ellen DeGeneres,' she said, nonsensically referring to the talk show host. 

 

Tearful: Jayci, from Corona, California, wipes away tears as she moans that Nicki Minaj is so pretty 

Emotional wreck? She appears to be crushed and heavily drugged, adding that she also wants Nicki's face

Other dreams: She also wailed that she's still not friends with talk show host Ellen DeGeneres

Matt, by this point, was completely confused: 'You wanted to look like her too?'

She threw a dagger-like stare back at him.

'No! I want to be friends with her!

'I love her.' 

'Ellen DeGeneres is generous. That's literally her name. And I love her!' Jayci said tearfully. 

Matt suggests a friendship could happen one day.

'Doubt it!' Jayci retorts.

The six-minute video continues as Jayci woefully speculates what life would be like  if she looked like Jay Z.

Practical joke: Jayci's husband Matt posted the video on his Facebook with the comment: 'you're welcome'

Viral: The video has gone viral but many have commented to call it a fake in a bid to get on the Ellen show

'Maybe Beyonce would like me. And I could be friends with Ellen DeGeneres.' 

When the nurse returns to ask how Jayci is doing, Matt laughs: 'She's great!'

The video, uploaded to YouTube by Matt, has become an internet sensation.  

However, many have slammed the video suggesting it is a fake in a bid to get on the Ellen show.

'Obviously fake lol but great acting two thumbs up!', one said. 

It comes weeks after a teenager was filmed by his mother in the car after dental surgery wailing that Beyonce had not been there.
