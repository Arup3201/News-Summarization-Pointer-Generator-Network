Family history: Samantha Cameron, wife of the Prime Minister, who researchers have discovered is linked to a 19th Century plantation owner

One of Samantha Cameron's ancestors was a slave owner who received millions from the British government following abolition, researchers have discovered.

The Prime Minister's wife is descended from 19th Century businessman William Jolliffe, from West Sussex, whose company was responsible for building Waterloo Bridge, Dartmoor Prison and the new London Bridge.

He subsequently gave up his commercial interests to become a vicar, but before he embraced the church Jolliffe was among those who received a huge payout after the 1833 Act of Parliament.

The Ballenbouche Estate in St Lucia, which was linked to the prominent businessman, received £4,000 in compensation for 164 slaves, or around £3.25million in today's money.

African slaves were brought to St Lucia in the 1700s and the Ballenbouche Estate, a sugar plantation, was probably established in the 1740s.

Jolliffe's son was the 1st Baronet Hylton, a former home secretary under the Earl of Derby, who married the daughter of the 4th Baronet Sheffield.

Mrs Cameron’s father, Sir Reginald Sheffield, 
is the 8th baronet and has an estimated fortune of £25m.

Her intriguing ancestry was revealed by researchers looking into the records of the Slave Compensation Commission, which was set up to manage the £20m fund.

Their findings appear in a database, the Legacies of British Slave-ownership, which has been compiled by University College London.

Dr Nick Draper, from UCL, was one of several academics who spent three years working on the project.

He said that up to 10% of Britons who died in the 18th century had benefited from slavery and that up to 15% of the British elite were involved.

'The amount of money available to the compensation fund reflects how much influence the elite had on the government.

'But they were not so powerful they could not stop the Abolition of Slavery Bill going through.'

Human trade: African slaves, like those depicted in this file picture, were sent across the world including to St Lucia, where Samantha Cameron's ancestor had a sugar plantation.

Mrs Cameron descends from a long line of aristocrats on both sides of her family.

Her father, who is a direct descendent of Charles II, can trace his bloodline back to the Knights Templar and the Fifth Crusade, and owns 3,000 acres of prime Lincolnshire farmland.

Much of the furniture at his country home once graced Buckingham Palace - which was the family's London pad, before they passed it on to the Queen.

His family's crest is a boar's head framed by two arrows.

He lives in Thealby Hall, north Lincolnshire, and manages the 3,000 acre Normanby estate, near Scunthorpe, which has been in the family since the 16th century.

He also owns Sutton Park, near York.

Mrs Cameron's mother, Annabel Jones, is descended from the 10th Baron Clifford of Chudleigh.

After divorcing Sir Reginald, she married the aristocratic Viscount Astor.

Meanwhile husband David is descended from King William IV and according to Debrett's is the fifth cousin, twice removed, of the Queen.

The Camerons' combined wealth is estimated in excess of £30m.
