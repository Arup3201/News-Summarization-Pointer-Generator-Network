'Time for action': Dr Clifford Mann said the report recommendations must be acted on

Out-of-hours GPs should be installed in every A&E department to help deal with the soaring number of patients, a report by experts has recommended.

They would be given the job of  assessing patients upon arrival to decide in what order they should be treated and deal with any less urgent cases.

Since 2004, family doctors have been allowed to opt out of working evenings and weekends and subcontract the care to private firms, which offer a patchy service.

And last year a total of 21.7million patients attended casualty, a rise of 50 per cent over the past decade.

The increase has been partly blamed on the failings of GPs’ out-of-hours services – a problem which has seen patients turning up at A&E departments when they don’t know where else to go.

Now a joint report from the College of Emergency Medicine – which represents A&E doctors – the Royal College of Physicians, the Royal College of Surgeons and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health has listed a series of recommendations to address the rise in demand.

The report warns that A&E units are becoming steadily more overwhelmed, particularly in winter when there is a surge in very ill patients. It calls for A&E units to be able to draft in doctors from other wards during very busy periods.

Sir Richard Thompson, president of the Royal College of Physicians, said: ‘Over the past few years, services for ill patients have been stretched by the sheer amount of acute and emergency admissions.

‘We have to plan better for the future to protect patient safety. If we do not implement them, then we shall simply walk blindfold into another winter crisis.’

And Dr Clifford Mann, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, said: ‘It would be nothing short of a scandal if these recommendations were not acted on. The time for action is now.’

Stretched: Last year a total of 21.7million patients attended casualty, a rise of 50 per cent over the last decade. The rise has been partly attributed to patients turning up at A&E when they have nowhere else to go

The report sets out 13 recommendations to address the challenges facing urgent and emergency care services across the UK and Ireland.

As well as out-of-hours family doctors, they said there should also be other health and social care workers in emergency departments to bridge the gap between GPs, hospitals and social care services in order to support vulnerable patients.

Aggressive sales reps who pester new mothers into buying their products face being banned from maternity wards.

Parenting
 promotions firm Bounty pays the NHS £2.3million a year to get access to
 maternity wards, where they sell products including high chairs, prams 
and car seats.

The sales reps collect women’s names and addresses and 
often pass them on to other companies.

But now the Care Quality 
Commission (CQC) will check whether Bounty staff are invading women’s 
privacy during hospital inspections.

It will inform hospital bosses of 
any concerns – who could decide to ban the representatives from the 
premises.

Professor Sir Mike Richards, CQC’s Chief Inspector of 
Hospitals, said: ‘Women who have recently given birth have a right to 
privacy and their dignity must be respected.’

They also said that community care and social care should be available seven days a week to support urgent and emergency care services, which would mean that patients could be safely discharged outside of normal working hours.

Dr Stephanie Smith of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said: ‘Emergency departments are being put under increased pressure as staff are faced with a growing number of patients who are either unable to access out-of-hours care or who see the emergency departments as their “go-to” for all health complaints.’

She added: ‘What we need to do now, and as today’s report highlights, is have better access to out-of-hours primary care, provide doctors with appropriate training and access to advice from paediatricians and have more effective and consistent advice and information sharing between healthcare professionals to reduce unnecessary admissions.’

But Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the Council of the British Medical Association, warned that implementing the recommendations would be expensive.

He said: ‘The system needs to be properly funded, fully resourced and adequately staffed.

‘It is crucial that patients are treated in the most appropriate setting, and receive the correct advice and care the first time around.’
