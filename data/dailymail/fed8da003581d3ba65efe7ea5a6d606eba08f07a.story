Stanley Marsh 3, the eccentric Texas millionaire famous for burying 10 vintage Cadillacs nose-down in an Amarillo field, has been charged with 11 felony counts of molesting children.

The decrepit 74-year-old turned himself in at a county jail after an arrest warrant was issued, accusing him of sexually abusing two teenagers in 2010. He was released from Potters County Detention Center on $300,000 bail.

His arrest comes just a week after several lawsuits alleging he paid 10 teens in cars, cash, drugs and alcohol for sex acts were filed against him.

Mr Marsh will likely be called before a before a grand jury in the next few weeks or in the new year.

'This is the beginning of the process,' special prosecutor Matt Powell said. 'This is what we felt like we needed to do.'

The millionaire had the teens engage 
in sexual acts, including masturbation and oral sex, on three days in 
2010, according to criminal complaints filed in Potter County. He was charged with six counts of child sexual assault and five counts of sexual performance by a child.

Mr Marsh's criminal attorneys, Paul 
Nugent and Heather Peterson of Houston, denied the charges, and instead 
accused the teens of waiting until the artist suffered a massive stroke 
last year to enact their plan to 'become multimillionaires.'

'The investigation into the group's claims is far from complete,' the attorneys wrote in their statement. 'There should be no premature rush to
judgment. Stanley Marsh 3 is not guilty of the group's allegations, and
will fight as vigorously as his declining health permits.'

The six lawsuits claim Mr Marsh paid 
the boys, ages 15 and 16, for sexual acts. One claimed that Mr Marsh 
provided him drugs and alcohol, bought him two cars, and paid him at 
several points during a year in sums of as much as $10,000.

Mr Marsh's civil attorney, Kelly Utsinger, has denied those allegations.

The teens' Houston-based civil 
attorney, Anthony Buzbee, said two of the young men went to police in 
late summer before the lawsuits were filed, but two others didn't speak 
with investigators until early November - about the time Mr Marsh's 
offices were searched. One teen's mother sought out a civil attorney 
when she didn't hear back from police, according to the lawsuits.

The lawsuits also claim the 
millionaire's wife, Wendy Marsh, and business partner David Weir, knew 
of the abuse and covered it up.

Mr Weir allegedly went as far as to 
force the boys to sign a waiver regarding his colleague's behaviour 
while they were in the office as employees or guests.

Mr Marsh, who inherited his 
grandfather's oil and gas fortune and previously owned TV station KVII, 
is best known for burying 10 brightly-coloured Cadillacs nose down along
Interstate 40 in the Panhandle in the 1970s.

The cars, ranging from a 1948 club 
coupe to a 1963 sedan and gathered from junkyards, private collectors 
and used car lots, have since become a pop art landmark.

Visitors through the years have 
splattered them with graffiti and in 2005 they were coated in pink to 
honor breast cancer victims, survivors and their families. Mr Marsh also
has painted them black and yellow to honor the passing of longtime 
friends.

The installation put Amarillo on the 
map in the 1970s and the bizarre attraction inspired a Bruce Springsteen
song a decade later which only boosted its popularity.

An Amarillo native and 
philanthropist, Mr Marsh and his wife have donated to local art and 
education causes. After he suffered the massive stroke and a series of 
smaller ones, his wife was appointed his guardian.

But the recent allegations aren't the first he's faced relating to youngsters.

Mr Marsh was indicted on charges of 
indecency with a child in 1996, but the charges were eventually 
dismissed. That same year Mr Marsh acknowledged no wrongdoing in a 
settlement with a youth who claimed Mr Marsh sexually abused him.

In 2001, parties in four lawsuits 
that alleged imprisonment, sexual misconduct and harassment of teens 
were settled. Mr Marsh apologized but no other details were made public.
