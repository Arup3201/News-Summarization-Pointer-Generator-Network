A seven-month-old baby has been killed in Texas after a driver allegedly ran a red light and crushed the stroller being pushed across the road by the boy's father.

Witnesses say that seconds after the crash, which occurred  at a busy intersection in Arlington, the father, Daniel Bingenheimer, picked up his tiny son, David, and screamed out in pain.

A white sedan being driven by a woman is said to have ran the light and collided with a red pickup truck, which then careened into the stroller.

'It was the dad carrying his baby over to (the woman in the sedan) yelling, ''Look at what you’ve done'',’ said Dr. Jerrod Edwards, whose office is nearby and attended the scene, according to The Fort Worth Star-Telegram.

David Bingenheimer was only seven-months-old when he was killed on Thursday

The little boy was pronounced dead at the scene.

Mr Bingenheimer is believed to have just left a convenience store and was waiting to cross the 2800 block of South Cooper Street when the accident occurred around 9.30am.

Police declined to identify the drivers of the two vehicles.

Police spokeswoman Cheryel Carpenter said investigators are trying to determine which vehicle had the green light.

One woman at a nearby bakery grabbed a white blanket and hurriedly covered the body, which was now on the ground.

'I knelt down to check on the baby . . . and took one look and there was no question,' Money said.

The infant was killed in his stroller yesterday when a truck crashed into it while he and his father waited to cross Cooper Street

Money then turned her attention to the woman in the sedan who was “tearing up the inside of her car and frantically screaming.”

Money said she convinced the woman to call her mom to come to the scene and calm her down.

The pickup truck driver was 'rattling off to the dad and kept saying, ''She hit me. She hit me'',’ Money said.

Money said she convinced him to stay by his truck until police arrived, she said.

Mr Bingenheimer, who was trying to reach his wife on his cell phone, appeared to have hurt his leg, Money said.

She said he was dragging it along, 'but was so upset, distraught and shocked'.
