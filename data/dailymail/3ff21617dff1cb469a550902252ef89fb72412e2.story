California users of STD dating site PositiveSingles will receive a total of $16.5 million in damages after the site shared their personal information despite the promise of confidentiality, authorities say.

The verdict was rendered in the amount of approximately $15 million in punitive damages and $1.5 million of compensatory damages to California users of the site under the California Legal Remedies Act, according to a Business Wire.

A lawsuit alleged that the site's registration page states that the site, marketed toward people with sexually transmitted diseases, is '100% confidential' and that it does 'not disclose, sell, or rent any personally identifiable information to any third party organizations.'

However, BBC reports, that PositiveSingles' parent site -- SuccessfulMatch -- runs a series of other dating sites and SuccessfulMatch used the photos and personal information of PositiveSingles users on many of its subsidiary dating sites such as MeetBlackPOZ, ChristianSafeHaven, AidsDate, and HerpesinMouth.

Though the site promised privacy, it turns out PositiveSingles was one of more than a thousand different sites placing user information -- including their STD status -- into a single database making it available to almost anyone.

The suit also stated that '[SuccessfulMatch] fraudulently and deceptively failed to disclose that profiles created through PositiveSingles.com could be viewed on Defendant's affiliate sites.'

Sites: PositiveSingles users had their profile information funneled to sites like HIVDatingOnline, ChristianSafeHaven,  AidsDate, and HerpesinMouth

An investigation into the site's privacy policy and terms of service began in 2011 when three individuals who posted their profiles on PositiveSingles noticed their profiles showed up on more than 50 dating websites without their permission or knowledge, according to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.

Many of the sites featuring the user's profiles were marketed toward different demographics than those mentioned in the user's profiles.

BBC reports that the plaintiff who filed the suit acknowledged that after completing the site's registration page, a link to its terms of service was provided which did state that information about STD statuses may be shared with other sites. 

However, the plaintiff suggested that few members ever read the fine print and Daily News reports that SuccessfulMatch used this loophole to publicize the personal information of users with infections, such as HIV, herpes and syphilis by making them available to almost anyone after funneling the information to SuccessfulMatch.
