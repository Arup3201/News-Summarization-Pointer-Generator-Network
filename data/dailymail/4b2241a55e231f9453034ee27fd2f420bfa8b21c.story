Three high-school friends have died and fourth was injured following a horrific crash in the early hours of Sunday, police said.

The four were traveling in a car which lost control and struck a tree at 2am on a straight stretch of road close to the New Hampshire Turnpike in Unity. The vehicle was cut in half by the force of the collision. 

Brittany Bailey, 18, of Claremont, died at the scene along with two 17-year-old boys, Brandon Rock and Jonathan Varnum. 

Brittany Bailey, 18, died in a car crash in the early hours of Sunday in New Hampshire along with two 17-year-old male friends when their vehicle struck a tree. The other 17-year-old girl survived and is in hospital 

The driver of the car was killed, police said, adding that drugs or alcohol were not involved but speed may have been a factor. 

It is not clear which teen was driving but the person lost control on the southbound side of the road, according to police, and slammed into the tree.

The injured teen, 17-year-old Selena Carrier, was taken to hospital and is in a stable condition. 

The four teenagers were students at Stevens High School, friends and family told ValleyNews.com.

Miss Bailey graduated in June and wanted to be a cosmetologist. Rock and Varnum were due to begin their senior year.

The two boys were described by relatives as fun-loving and people who always looked out for their family and friends.

The crash involving a 1997 model Saab happened in front of the home of Larry and Diana Owen.

Jonathan Varnum, 17, was also killed in the crash with two other friends on a New Hampshire road in the early hours of Sunday

Mr Owen said that the noise of the crash woke him and he believes that if it hadn't been for the oak tree, the car could have plowed into his front bedroom and killed him. The couple were the first to call 911. 

He told ValleyNews that  the force of the horrific accident caused his front windows to break and that the car had been cut in two. He told the newspaper: 'It was not recognizable as a car.' 

Stevens High School is offering counselling to its students today.
