It may not boast the most impressive camera or respond touch ID, but a new smartphone claims to beat the big smartphone brands at being the most ethical in the world.

The Fairphone is built using conflict-free minerals and is assembled in a factory where the welfare of workers is a top priority.

The mobile has been designed for people who care more about their gadgets’ environmental and societal impact than top specifications, but it still hosts an array of apps and looks like any other smartphone.

The Fairphone is available from The Phone Co-op, which claims to be the UK’s most socially-minded mobile provider. 

The Android handset has a quad-core 1.2Ghz processor and 16GB of memory, an eight megapixel rear camera and a 4.3 inch touchscreen – comparing with a mid-range smartphone, rather than the likes of the Galaxy S5 or iPhone 6.

It's cheaper than the two high-end options, costing from £22 a month, or £250 up front with £2 a month line rental, with an additional monthly fee of £5 for 1GB of data. A pay as you go option will be available soon.

In comparison, a 16GB iPhone 6 handset costs £539, or from £38 a month on contract, albeit with twice as much data as the Fairphone.

All of the four billion smartphones now in operation around the world use tiny amounts of more than 30 metals including gold, tantalum and tin, of which production results in enormous environmental damage.

Fairphone works directly with initiatives in the Democratic Republic of Congo to source tin and tantalum in a responsible way.

Many mines in the Republic are controlled by armed rebel groups who extort money from the miners, contributing to political and economic instability. So Fairphone invests in certified conflict-free mines to improve workers’ rights and economic prosperity.

The company also works with a Chinese factory where it has set up a worker welfare fund.

For every phone sold, $5 (£3) is paid into this fund, worth $300,000 (£190,165) to date. The money will be spent on projects that benefit workers, such as wage levels, workplace improvements, skills training and leisure activities.

Large electronics companies have come under fire for working with Foxxconn, in China, which produces around 40 per cent of the world’s consumer electronics.

The company has been accused of underage labour, long shifts, poor conditions and even suicides in the past and there has been demand from consumers for ethical products.

Fairphone’s ethical credentials are accredited by the Ethical Consumer organisation.

Vivian Woodell, Chief Executive of The Phone Co-op, said: ‘Customers who want to buy ethically can get the complete package by getting their Fairphone through The Phone Co-op.

‘We are the only UK telecoms provider owned by our customers. They told us they wanted the choice of a smartphone where every link in the supply chain reflected our values of honesty and fairness. We’ve listened – and that’s why the partnership with Fairphone is such a great fit.’

Tessa Wernink, Director of Communications of Fairphone said: ‘Fairphone is a starting point for positive social change in the electronics industry.'
