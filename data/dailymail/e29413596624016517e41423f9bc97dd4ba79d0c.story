Campaigner: Actress Angelina Jolie

When celebrities lend their names to a good cause, it rarely fails to attract some welcome publicity.

The trouble is, the main beneficiaries are usually the stars themselves, according to a study by British academics.

And while only a cynic would suggest they are motivated by anything more than a selfless desire to help others, their efforts do little to make people remember the charity they are supporting.

Instead, the study found, appearing altruistic makes stars such as Angelina Jolie, Robbie Williams and Emma Watson more popular. 

Two thirds of people could not link any celebrity with a list of seven well-known charities and aid organisations that they supported, the research found.

And most who donate do so because of personal or family connections to the issues, not because of the stars supporting them. 

Many charities and aid groups now rely heavily on celebrities to help promote their cause.

Miss Jolie is the face of the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative, which campaigns to combat rape in conflicts. 

Harry Potter actress Miss Watson was recently appointed a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador and Williams helped launch Soccer Aid, which raises funds for Unicef.

But the research concluded that even though celebrities are doing it for the right reasons, they ‘often do better’ out of the attention than their causes. 

Professor Dan Brockington, of the University of Manchester, and Professor Spencer Henson, of Sussex University, said: ‘Our survey found that while awareness of major NGO brands was high, awareness of celebrity advocates for those brands was low.’

The seven organisations mentioned in the survey of 2,000 people included Christian Aid, Action Aid, Amnesty International and the Red Cross.

Jane Cooper, of Unicef UK, said: ‘Celebrities have a unique ability to reach millions of people, many of whom may not normally be engaged.’

Singer Robbie Williams has several charitable achievements under his belt, including helping launch Soccer Aid which raises funds for Unicef
