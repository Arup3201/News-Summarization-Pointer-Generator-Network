A coroner has criticised the Ministry of Defence for a series of failures which led to the deaths of two soldiers in a fire as they slept at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan.

Privates Dean Hutchinson, 23, and Robert Wood, 28 - plus one survivor - were sleeping in a tented office so they could respond more quickly when vital supplies arrived.

But in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2011 witnesses could smell smoke and went out to see flames engulfing the air-conditioned canvas unit.

Today David Ridley, Wiltshire and Swindon Coroner, condemned a string of 'contributory factors' to the deaths - including a broken fire alarm.

The MoD now has 56 days to reply in writing with details of actions that have been taken to prevent future similar deaths.

Pte Wood, known as Woody, had become a
 father to a boy, Noah, shortly before he died. He was a driver port 
operator, posted to 17 Port and Maritime Regiment, and lived in 
Hampshire.

Pte Hutchinson, from County Durham, was a driver and had seven years’ service with the Army.

The inquest heard that both senior 
commanders and fire safety officers did not know the soldiers were 
sleeping on duty during night shifts at the base in Helmand Province.

Witnesses described struggling to get hold of emergency services when they saw the Transport Troop unit was ablaze.

Private Sikeli Ratu, who was woken by 
the smell of smoke, fled the canvas tent to raise the alarm but soldiers at the scene did not know the emergency 222 number.

He told the court he 
could hear Pte Hutchinson calling his name.

By
 the time firefighters arrived at the scene, the blaze had taken hold of
 the tent, with flames approximately 3ft high and only the metal tent 
poles remaining of the structure.

They had been sleeping in the canvas tent in Camp Bastion (pictured) to be closer to vital supplies being delivered

Fire
 investigators have concluded that the blaze started in the vicinity of 
the electrical appliances - including a 32in flat-screen TV, boiler and fridge, and a nearby air conditioning unit.

The fire quickly spread, igniting combustible 
materials stored nearby, the court heard.

Recording a narrative conclusion, Mr Ridley listed the seven errors that led to the deaths of Pte Hutchinson and Pte Wood:

'The
 systemic failure by the chain of command to communicate the occurrence 
of sleeping on duties at night to key personnel, such as the unit fire 
safety officer, as safety measures associated with this practice to all 
Transport Troop personnel.

'The failure to police the occurrence of sleeping on duties at night through the use of random checks.

'The
 failure to effectively check the working functionality of the nine-volt
 smoke detector located inside the tent where the fire started, 
resulting in it not being in working order at the time of the fire.

'The
 systemic failure to provide effective training, especially to fire 
NCOs, to identify the potential risk of the overloading of sockets and 
extension blocks.

The MoD now has 56 days to make or plan measures to prevent future similar deaths of soldiers

'The 
failure to rectify the error in the December 2010 fire risk assessment, 
when it became known that sleeping was taking place within the tent in 
December 2010.

'The failure to request a fresh fire risk assessment following the structural alterations that took place in January 2011.

'The absence of the Transport Troop tent from the theatre asset register.'

The court heard senior officers were not certain who was responsible for checking the smoke detectors in the Transport Troop tent.

It also emerged senior officers were not certain who was responsible for checking the smoke detectors in the Transport Troop tent.

The rear of the Transport Troop tent was not permanently sealed and could be opened by unzipping the fire retardant inner lining and undoing the toggles to the canvas door.

But the rear door to the adjacent Quartermaster’s tent was tied up tightly and also padlocked, the inquest was told.

Since the tragedy a number of changes have been made by the Ministry of Defence and Army to improve safety for troops using tents.
