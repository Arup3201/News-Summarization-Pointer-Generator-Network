Barcelona coach Luis Enrique said he has received no ultimatum from the club over his future after a defeat by Real Sociedad and a fallout with Lionel Messi left him fighting for his job.

The Barça coach refused to comment on individual stories suggesting he had rowed with Messi and refused to answer a question about how the player took the news that he was to be left out of the first game of the new year last Sunday.

'I have not received any ultimatum, if I had it would have been the first time in my short career, but I have not,' said the coach who also admitted he was 'sad' about the sacking of sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta admitting that it weakened his own position.

Asked about an argument he is alleged to have had with Messi last Friday he repeated: 'I am not here to deny or confirm any of these stories. My job is to coach the first team. We are still in all the competitions and I am optimistic about the rest of the season.'

Amid suggestions he has lost the Barcelona dressing room and has been given two games to save his job he said: 'I have the same relationship with him (Messi) as when I joined the club. And it's the same as with all the players. Coaches always depend on results but I do feel backed by the players and by the board. 

'I have nothing to be sorry for in terms of how I treat the players. I am piloting the ship as I see fit. And I'm not going to comment on all the stories that have come out in the last couple of days.'

Asked if he talks to Messi on a daily basis he said: 'I talk to all the players. He is the best player in the world but I have said that so many times I don't need to repeat it.'
