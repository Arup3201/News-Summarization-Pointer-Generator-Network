Marco Reus may have had a bumpy time of it recently, but the Borussia Dortmund talisman could well and truly live life in the fast lane in the most random of circumstances.

Earlier in the week, the 25-year-old was fined £427,000 for being found guilty of driving without a license by the German authorities.

As a result of his misdemeanours Reus has subsequently been banned from getting behind a wheel - an obvious hindrance to his everyday life.

As a result of his ban, German model Jordan Carver has allegedly offered to be Reus' chaffeur

However, according to Vietnamese website Bondgaplus the mercurial forward has been offered help by a clamour of women to be his chaffeur - including glamourous German model Jordan Carver.

'Marco, my beloved. I am not only willing to be your chaffeur 24/7, but I can help you get your driver's licence back,' Carver reportedly said.

'Just agree to the following conditions: either love me or you have to movre from Dortmund to Bayern. I'm slightly greedy, but both options are awesome!'

Carver's demands in return for her driving included Reus moving to Bayern Munich from Dortmund

The 28-year-old  beauty is a clear fan of Reus but her second demand won't prove popular among the Dortmund faithful who have lost Mario Gotze and Robert Lewandowski to their bitter rivals in successive seasons.

Reus' absence through injury was telling once more for Jurgen Klopp's side as they lost 2-1 at Werder Bremen on Saturday. 

That result means that Dortmund could end the year bottom of the league if Freiburg beat Hannover on Sunday.
