Unwitting: Georgina Baillie was caught up in a prank call to her grandfather Andrew Sachs made by Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross

The family of Andrew Sachs have urged him to mend his relationship with his granddaughter after the ‘Sachsgate’ affair more than five years ago.

Georgina Baillie was unwittingly caught up in a prank call to Mr Sachs made by Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross, in which Brand said on-air that he had slept with her.

The Radio 2 presenters left a series of obscene messages on the Fawlty Towers actor’s answer machine during a late-night show in October 2008.

It later emerged former private school girl Miss Baillie, now 28, was a burlesque dancer in a group called Satanic Sluts.

Sachs, who has hardly spoken to his granddaughter since, said only this week: ‘We don’t talk to Georgina. It was so disgusting what she was doing.’

Her father Charles Baillie has urged Sachs, 83, and his wife Melody, 81, to see their oldest grandchild.

In a letter to The Times, he disputed Sachs’s suggestion – in an interview to promote his autobiography – that she ‘had made no efforts’ to see them.

Mr Baillie, 62, wrote: ‘Georgina has tried regularly to get back in touch over the past six years and her efforts were always rejected – except once, a year ago. We hope that they will remember that she was forgiven, invited back into the fold and was invited to Grandma’s 80th birthday party at The Ivy and then uninvited a few days before the event.

‘All I can pray for is that Granddad and Grandma Sachs will call Georgina, accept her apologies and resume normal relations. They are so loved and missed, and all are poorer for not being in each others’ lives.’

Mr Baillie, a former principal at the National Theatre, is divorced from Sachs’s daughter Kate, 53, but said both he and his ex-wife worry about the effect the prank had on the elderly couple.

Last night, Mrs Sachs said neither she nor her husband had any plan of being reunited with Miss Baillie, and told Mr Baillie, whom they have not seen for a decade, to ‘mind his own business’.

From their five-bedroom Hampstead home, she said: ‘I don’t want to speak to Georgie, I don’t really want to be friendly with Georgie, I don’t want a relationship with Georgie.

Hurt: Andrew and Melody Sachs have hardly spoken to their granddaughter since, and say they have no plans to be reunited with her

‘The only reason Brand knew who her grandfather was is because she told him when they were watching television together and he came on to the screen. If she hadn’t told him this would never have happened.’

She said their relationship was difficult in the year before Sachsgate, but broke down totally afterwards. The couple were upset that Miss Baillie worked with celebrity publicist Max Clifford and sold her story, including details of her sex life with Brand, to a tabloid.

In that piece, Miss Baillie said Brand ‘seemed obsessed by the idea that he was close to Manuel’s granddaughter’ and complained he was ‘a disappointment in the bedroom considering he has had so much practice’.

Outrage: The incident provoked 42,000 complaints and Brand later resigned, while Ross was suspended

Mrs Sachs said: ‘She went to Max Clifford and, then of course, did quite well out of it in magazines and newspapers.

‘She must have made a lot of money out of it. It kept it all going for a long time. It would have been better had she just kept quiet after it.

‘We absolutely adored her. We paid for her to go to the best school [£15,000-a-year Queen’s Gate School, Kensington].’

Asked what changed, she will only say: ‘There is a long history, but I don’t want to make things worse.’

Miss Baillie recently toured as a singer with Eighties pop star Adam Ant, 59, before quitting to study acting.

Speaking out: Sachs, who played Manuel in the BBC sitcom Fawlty Towers with John Cleese (left), has been promoting his autobiography, I Know Nothing

Her grandmother said she was tempted to patch things up in February last year, at her own 80th birthday party, but changed her mind at the last minute.

She said: ‘There was a time when I thought about reconciling with Georgie for her mother’s sake.

‘But then I saw Brand on television [when he appeared on The Jonathan Ross show] and I thought, ‘Oh my God, what am I doing? . . . I don’t want the aggravation, I can’t cope with it.’

Sachs, who played Manuel in the BBC sitcom Fawlty Towers with John Cleese, has been promoting his autobiography, I Know Nothing. Speaking to The Times, he said of his granddaughter: ‘Yes it’s sad. I hate it. I hate it. But she’s made no efforts as far as I know.’

It was this that prompted Mr Baillie to write publicly to Mr Sachs.

In the prank, Ross crudely told Sachs: ‘He f***** your granddaughter’, while Brand responded, ‘I did not do nothing with Georgina – oh no, I’ve revealed I know her name.’ The incident provoked 42,000 complaints and Brand later resigned, while Ross was suspended.
