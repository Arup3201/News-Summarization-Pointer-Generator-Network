A 17-year-old boy has died on the final day of Latitude festival after suffering from an 'isolated medical condition'.

The teenager, who has not been named, was airlifted from the festival at Henham Park, near Southwold in Suffolk, yesterday afternoon.

He died in the early hours of today at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, organisers said.

A statement read: 'The young male suffered from an isolated medical condition. The police are not treating this as suspicious.'

The boy was treated by three air ambulance medics at the scene after becoming seriously ill, the East Anglian Air Ambulance said.

Around 35,000 people have attended the family-friendly arts and music festival since Thursday.

The event was headlined by Lily Allen and former Blur frontman Damon Albarn, with American rock duo The Black Keys set to play a final headline performance tonight.

Over the course of the festival, weather conditions have been varied, with temperatures reaching 28C on the first day.

But over the weekend, there have been spectacular storms and rains, resulting in muddy conditions.

Many festival-goers packed up their tents this morning and some cars were spotted struggling in the mud in the car parks.

Last night, Albarn and Graham Coxon staged a mini-Blur revival as heavy rain began to fall.

Guitarist Coxon joined his former 
bandmate on stage for an encore as thunder rumbled and lightning forked 
across the sky above the main stage.

After a solo rendition of early song End Of A Century, Albarn told the crowd: 'There are some Blur songs I can play on the piano, but this one would be impossible without the man I wrote it with.'

On Friday night, Lily Allen tackled her critics head-on at the festival, headlining the packed main arena in a pair of small denim shorts.

Wearing her red hair tied back, the 
singer took the place of Two Door Cinema Club after they pulled out at 
the last minute due to illness.

Earlier in the day, Allen said she was 'exhausted by nastiness' on Twitter after agreeing to take the Irish indie band's place.

For her second track, she joked: 'Can we do this at such short notice?', before launching into a rendition of the band's hit Something Good Can Work.
