More than 100 Labour Parliamentary candidates are linked to the giant left-wing Unite union prompting new questions about the influence wielded by the union and its leader 'Red' Len McCluskey

More than 100 Labour Parliamentary candidates are linked to the giant left-wing Unite union, it emerged last night.

The total has increased nearly four-fold in just 12 months and nearly one in three prospective MPs now has ties to Unite.

The figures last night prompted new questions about the influence over Labour party policy wielded by the union and its leader ‘Red’ Len McCluskey.

The Tories said they showed Unite was ‘buying up’ Labour candidates and ‘dancing to Len McCluskey’s tune’.

But Labour insisted union support does not lead to ‘undue influence’.

The union, which supported Ed Miliband in his Labour leadership bid, has since donated more than £12million to the party.

Mr McCluskey has also pledged to spend millions more in the run-up to the General Election – while telling Mr Miliband to 'bring home the bacon' for union members.

Unite has also drawn up a list of demands for an incoming Labour government - including higher taxes, huge spending increases, an end to 'austerity' and a ditching of all anti-union laws passed in the 1980s and 1990s.

And one senior Unite figure has revealed the union is demanding Mr Miliband appoint a ‘Secretary of State for Unions’ if he wins next year’s General Election.

The revelations will also resurrect the Falkirk scandal over attempts by the union to ‘fix’ the selection of the Scottish town’s general election candidate.

Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘These astonishing figures lay bare just how deep into Len McCluskey’s clutches Labour have sunk.

‘Ed  Miliband's chief union paymaster installed him as leader and is now buying-up Labour candidates across the country.

‘And we know, just like the Labour leader, they all dance to Len McCluskey's ruinous tune: more spending, more borrowing and more debt than future generations can ever hope to repay.’

The figures, which were uncovered by the Conservatives, showed 101 out of the 301 parliamentary candidates have ties to Unite – or nearly one in three.

That compares to just 27 candidates a year ago. And in around 100 target seats, nearly half of all candidates have a link to Unite.

A total of 190 prospective Labour MPs have links to any trade union.

Among those selected include Christian Matheson, for the City of Chester, who works as an industrial officer for Unite.

Another is Nancy Platts, who is the candidate in Brighton Kempton, who has described the Labour Party as ‘a route into government for the union movement’.

And one candidate, Jo Stevens in Cardiff, is backed by a staggering nine unions.

Unite donations make up 29 per cent of all the money received by Labour since Ed Miliband was elected Labour leader in 2010.

In Falkirk, people were signed up to be Labour members so they could vote for the Unite candidate – at least one without their consent.

One Labour MP, Austin Mitchell, has described how seats are ‘sewn up’ for union candidates or those preferred by party HQ.

He described how the number of candidates is deliberately whittled down, making it easier to ‘indulge in the type of manipulation for union favourites, relatives or partners seen most notoriously in Falkirk.’

A Labour spokesman said: ‘We are proud to have selected a wide range of candidates with varying backgrounds including carers, military personnel and business people.

‘One Nation Labour is a party that stands for the whole country.

‘Our affiliates' support does not get them any undue influence over our candidate selection process.

‘Labour’s individual members give the largest proportion of all our donations, and Labour stands up for the millions David Cameron is asking to pay more, while he is giving 13,000 millionaires an average £100,000 tax cut.’
