Amateur footage purporting to be of Colonel Gaddafi, his son Mutassim and his defence minister Abu Bakr Yunis moments before they were taken away to be buried at a secret location in the Libyan desert has emerged.

The grainy video, shot on a mobile phone, shows three open wooden coffins each containing a body wrapped in a white sheet.

Dubai-based television network Al Alaan claims the footage is of a funeral ceremony near Misrata yesterday.

A cleric performs what appears to be the ritual Islamic funeral prayer of Salat al-Janazah. He is believed to be Khaled Tantoush, Gaddafi's personal cleric who was captured with him last week.

The ceremony is witnessed by a crowd of onlookers, thought to include two of the despot's cousins, Mansour Dhao Ibrahim and Ahmed Ibrahim.

Two members of Libya’s National 
Transitional Council then accompanied the bodies to their final resting 
place.

The men swore on the Koran never to reveal its location.

Libya’s
new leaders fear the site could otherwise be vandalised or turned into a
shrine for the former dictator’s supporters, but they say access will 
be granted to ‘international organisations’ asking to see it.

In other developments, a spokesman for the National Transitional Council (NTC) today claimed that chemical weapons have been found in Libya and have been secured.

Speaking at a meeting between the council and Nato representatives in Qatar, he said: 'They are from the Gaddafi era and are under guard, until they can be handed over.'

Nato, meanwhile, has postponed until 
later this week a meeting expected  to formalise a decision
to end the Libya mission at the end of the month.

The postponement comes after
Libya's interim leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil today said that Nato should stay involved in Libya until the end of this year to help prevent Gaddafi loyalists from leaving the country.

Nato has said it does not intend to keep forces in the Libyan region after concluding its mission and has repeatedly stated that its UN mandate is to protect civilians, not to pursue individuals - although Gaddafi himself was captured after his convoy was hit in a Nato air strike.

Nato
ambassadors had been expected to meet today to formalise a preliminary 
decision taken last week to end the mission on October 31.

Nato spokeswoman Carmen Romero said this meeting had now been postponed. She said: 'The North Atlantic Council will meet with partners on Friday to discuss our Libya mission and take a formal decision.

'As agreed, Nato continues to monitor the situation on the ground, and retains the capability to respond to any threats to civilians. The situation remains calm as the NTC continues to establish its authority.'

Romero said Nato Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen was in consultations with the UN and Libya's National Transitional Council about plans to conclude the mission.

Nato states took their decision last week based on military recommendations. 

The commander of the Libya mission, Lieutenant-General Charles Bouchard, said on Monday that he saw virtually no risk of forces loyal to Gaddafi mounting successful attacks to regain power and Nato believed NTC forces were able to handle security threats.

Nato states have been keen to see a quick conclusion to a costly effort that has involved more than 26,000 air sorties and round-the-clock naval patrols at a time when defence budgets are under severe strain due to the global economic crisis.
