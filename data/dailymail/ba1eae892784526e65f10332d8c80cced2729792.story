As the 89-year-old heir to Brooke Astor's fortune was wheeled out of court to begin his prison term for stealing millions of dollars from his mother's estate, his wife wept and hugged him.

Anthony Marshall was ordered to begin serving his one to three year term after losing a series of requests to avoid prison because of his failing health.

'I take no pleasure in following my duties,' Manhattan's Supreme Court Justice A Kirke Bartley said as he ordered Marshall to serve the minimum sentenced handed down to him in 2009.

Astor had been a fixture of New York society before her death at the age of 105, in 2007.

Her charitable largesse was recognized in 1998 with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's top civilian honor.

Astor inherited the money from her third husband, Vincent Astor, a great-great-grandson of real estate and fur magnate John Jacob Astor, who was one of the first multimillionaires in the U.S.

When Marshall arrived in the courtroom on Friday in a wheelchair, his wife Charlene cried and caressed his shoulder.

He declined to speak during the brief proceeding, looking downward but showing little reaction.

In earlier trials his wife, who one of Marshall's sons blames for the family's troubles, had been accused by prosecutors as being the motive for Marshall taking money from his mother.

Elizabeth Loewy, a prosecutor, has said Marshall defrauded his mother 'because of his “preoccupation for getting money for Charlene', according to the New York Times.

The original trial was also told that Astor disliked her daughter-in-law and one of her nurses referred to Mrs Marshall as 'Miss Piggy'.

Her dislike for Mrs Marshall was allegedly shown in her will, when she left her two second-hand mink coats in a size 6, knowing she would never be able to wear them.

At Marshall's sentencing on Friday, the judge read parts of a letter from one of his twin sons, Alec, urging the court to spare him prison.

'Please consider all the good that my father has done for this country ... My father once said, about the events that happened before the case, that, "you can't change the past," Justice Bartley quoted the letter as saying. He urged Marshall to allow his son to get back in contact with him.

Marshall's twin sons from an earlier marriage, Alec and Phillip, had testified against their father in the 2009 trial.

And it was Philip who brought the original guardianship case against his father in 2006, charging him of misusing Astor's funds, according to Vanity Fair. The civil case was settled but a criminal case quickly followed.

Prosecutors said Marshall, a decorated Second World War veteran and former U.S. ambassador, exploited his mother's failing mind to loot her millions. 

After her Alzheimer's diagnosis, Marshall bought himself lavish gifts, including a $920,000 yacht, with her money.

He also took valuable artwork off her walls and engineered changes to her will that gave him control of most of her estate, including millions previously earmarked for her favorite charities, the Manhattan district attorney's office said.

Astor had devoted her life to 
philanthropy, giving eye-watering sums of money to the St Regis Hotel, 
the New York Public Library and the Metropolitan Art Museum.

However,
the multimillionaire was left to spend her last days in allegedly 
heart-breaking conditions - her dogs messing over her Park Avenue 
apartment while she napped in her own urine with no one to help.

She died in her 64-acre Holly Hill 
estate in New York, in August 2007. The estate, and her Park Avenue home
in Manhattan, were later sold.

When the wranglings over her $100 million estate were settled in March last year, it was reported that Marshall was ordered to pick  $74,680 worth of her possessions.

He chose a mixture of items, from a $30 wall bracket shaped like a tortoise to a $40,000 painting of a donkey by Giovanni Tiepolo, Vanity Fair said.

In the settlement, the Metropolitan Museum agreed to a settlement of $3 million for the Childe Hassam painting Flags Fifth Avenue, 1917, which had been bequeathed to the museum but sold by Mashall for $10 million in 2002.

The Astor family made their money in the fur trade in the 1700s. Marshall's step-grandfather, John Jacob Astor, was the wealthiest passenger to die on the Titantic, where he was last seen smoking a cigarette on the top deck.

Marshall's lawyers said she knowingly changed her will to benefit her only child, and that he had legal authority for the gifts he gave himself from her money.

His lawyers and doctors said a prison term could kill Marshall, who has Parkinson's disease, depends on a wheelchair and cannot get out of bed, go to the bathroom, bathe, or dress himself without help.

After losing a series of appeals, lawyers for Marshall and his co-defendant Francis Morrissey Jr -  a former estates lawyer convicted of forging Astor's signature on a change to her will - filed papers last week seeking a new trial and asking that both remain free.

Justice Bartley rejected that request and sent Morrissey, 72, to prison on Thursday.

Morrissey was convicted of forging Astor's signature on a change to her will. His defense argued that if the signature was phony, he knew nothing of it.

Morrissey's lawyers indicated that 
they would continue an appeal that hinges on a sworn statement from 
juror Judi DeMarco, who said she felt threatened when another juror made
hostile gestures, cursed at her and started toward her during 
deliberations.

Ms DeMarco said she felt 
demoralized when she asked to get off the jury, but Justice Bartley 
instead told the panel to keep deliberating civilly.

'I was tired and beaten and felt totally alone' and finally 'acquiesced in guilty verdicts that I did not in good conscience believe were legitimate,' Ms DeMarco, who is also an attorney, said in the June 8 statement.

Her claims were part of Marshall's and Morrissey's unsuccessful appeals.

The state court's Appellate Division concluded the jury tensions 'appeared to resolve themselves, and there is no reason to believe that the ultimate unanimous verdict, confirmed by polling [asking whether each juror agreed with the verdict], was the result of coercion'.

However, the defense lawyers argued that the new statement merited at least a hearing.
