A grandmother was stabbed and strangled to death in her home by her neighbour for just £30, a jury was told.

Within an hour, Christian Darko had spent £4 on lottery tickets, £6 on cigarettes and £20 on electricity top-ups using the stolen cash, Teesside Crown Court heard.

Jurors were told that Mrs Doughty's granddaughter later found her dead in her Middlesbrough flat the same afternoon.

Christian Darko, 41, is accused of murdering Rose Doughty the day after her 72nd birthday.

Jurors were told Darko accepted responsibility for the unlawful killing after admitting manslaughter, but he denies murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

Opening the murder trial, prosecutor Nick Dry said Darko killed Mrs Doughty for £30 in her flat in Netherfields, Middlesbrough.

'He was her downstairs neighbour and a man to whom she'd only shown kindness,' Mr Dry said, adding that Darko had been asking her for money for his electricity meter.

He said Darko visited her flat, directly above his own, on the morning of November 23 last year.

He was seen going into her home of about 20 years at 10.10am, leaving about a minute later.

Mr Dry told the jury: 'It is likely, say the prosecution, that by that time Rose Doughty was either dead or dying, stabbed and strangled by the defendant who then returned to steal from her.'

He changed his clothes and spent £20 on an electricity top-up, £6 on cigarettes and £4 on lottery tickets, the jury heard.

He then spent hours at another resident's home, saying he was 'in trouble'.

Mrs Doughty's granddaughter found her dead in the flat that afternoon.

As she came downstairs crying and calling for an ambulance, she passed Darko, who asked her whether everything was OK, said Mr Dry.

He said Mrs Doughty died from strangulation, with stab wounds to her face, neck and abdomen which contributed to her death, and bruising consistent with being struck.

The daughter of 72-year-old Rose Doughty has paid tribute to her kind, loving, straight-talking mum.

Teesside Crown Court heard how Mrs Doughty was doted on and visited daily by her children and grandchildren.

Jacqueline Brown said in a statement read out at Teesside Crown Court yesterday: 'I called my mam 'dozy Rosie' because of some of the things she'd come out with.

'She made me cry with laughter. She was so kind-hearted. Everybody loved her. She loved the kids. Their friends would come round and call her nana. She was a lovely woman.'

She said the mother-of-four and grandmother-of-11 left the radio on for the birds when she left her flat in Netherfields.

Her mother spent most of her time in the flat, loved Facebook as it kept her up to date with family and friends, and played games on her laptop.

Ms Brown said at the time of her mother's death, her health and confidence had been improving after she underwent treatment in hospital.

'She seems to have been healthier now than she had been for years,' added Ms Brown.

'She was really enjoying life.'

When police visited him, Darko said another neighbour lent him £10, and he didn't mention his trips to Mrs Doughty's flat.

When
 CCTV revealed his movements he was arrested on suspicion of murder. He 
replied: 'Can I ask the reason why? What have I done?'

He
 told police medical staff he suffered from depression. He said he went 
to Mrs Doughty's flat to borrow a heater with a knife in a bag.

He said he couldn't remember why he had the knife or what exactly he did to her.

A grey hat was found on a bed in her flat carrying Darko's DNA. Her blood was found on the hat and on gloves found in Darko's home.

Mr Dry said the jury would hear from psychiatrists and psychologists about Darko's mental state: 'That will be the ultimate issue for you to decide in this case.'

The defence say he had an 'abnormality of his mental functioning' from depression and a learning disability, added Mr Dry.

He
 said it would be suggested that this 'substantially impaired his 
ability to form a rational judgment at the time he killed Rose Doughty'.

Mr
 Dry said: 'It is the prosecution's case that a clear picture emerges 
from the evidence of a premeditated murder for gain, the defendant 
acting with obvious purpose, taking what he wanted when his repeated 
requests were denied, spending what little Rose Doughty had to take and 
then attempting to cover his tracks.'

The trial continues.
