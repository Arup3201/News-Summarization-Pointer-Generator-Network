A British holidaymaker has died after a drink and drugs binge on the Spanish party island of Ibiza.

John Sharp, 31, was found floating dead in the water off the resort of Playa d'en Bossa near Bora Bora nightclub on Saturday morning.

Police spent days trying to identify him after he was pulled out of the sea in a pair of swimming trunks with no ID on him.

A post-mortem examination revealed he had taken several drugs including cocaine, ecstasy and speed.

Clubbers who partied with Mr Sharp before he was found dead have told investigators he was also drinking heavily.

A source close to the probe, being led by an investigating magistrate, said: 'We believe he had been dead around 24 hours when he was found floating in the sea.

'He went out partying last Thursday night and was last seen alive by witnesses police have spoken to around 8am the day before he was found dead.'

Mr Sharp's parents flew to the island to identify him after being contacted by the Foreign Office.

It is not known where in Britain he is from.

Ibiza's drugs scene has been under the spotlight since the arrests in Peru earlier this month of suspected drugs mules Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum.

They were working in Ibiza over the summer when they claim they were kidnapped by Colombian gunmen and forced to fly to Lima to bring back nearly 12kg of cocaine hidden in their suitcases.

They are currently awaiting trial in a Lima jail after being charged with drugs trafficking.

Spanish police say they have not ruled out arrests in Ibiza in connection with the failed drugs smuggling operation.

Eleven members of a Brit-led drugs trafficking gang arrested in Ibiza in 2009 were sentenced to a total of 32 years in jail in Spain in June after striking a last-minute deal with prosecutors.

Ringleader Shachar Cohen was sentenced to four and a half years in prison.

Mum-of-one Janine Mallett, 31, from Stockton-on-Tees near Middlesborough, drowned in nearby San Antonio at the start of July after binging on a cocktail of drugs.

She was found after becoming separated from a friend she had gone on holiday with during a night out.
