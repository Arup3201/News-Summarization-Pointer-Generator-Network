Facebook's new app Paper has become an instant hit with customers, rocketing up the charts within hours of its release.

The newsreader app replaces many of the parts of its traditional app - and sparked fears it could kill the traditional Facebook app entirely.

Today, it appeared to be a hit with customers - reaching number 4 on the iTunes download store within hours of release.

Facebook Paper, pictured, is the first product to launch from the California firm's Creative Labs project. It's a news curation app that pulls in stories, photos and videos from a user's Facebook news feed. It additionally comes with Facebook's own notification bar and action buttons. The app is set to launch on 3 February

Facebook has a history of developing separate apps for new features, such as the Facebook Messenger and Camera apps. 

Like Paper, these apps linked with the original Facebook app but had their own set of features. Facebook Messenger lets people chat while using other apps, for example.

Paper, on the other hand, includes many of Facebook's existing features.

However, FiftyThree, makers of the iPad drawing app Paper, said it had contacted Facebook about changing the name of its news reading app Paper.

While Facebook apologized for not checking with FiftyThree, it did not change the name.

Facebook 'should stop using our brand name,' FiftyThree said.

Facebook's Paper is a news curation and reader app that pulls in stories, photos, videos and links from the user's Facebook feed - alongside Facebook's own notification bar and action buttons.

All stories are displayed on a customisable picture-led grid, and the app has been designed to make it easier to share content with other people.

Users can also browse content and read stories from partner publications, as well as customise which categories they see.

Paper is set to launch in the U.S. on 3 February.

The app looks similar to news reader rivals Flipboard and Google Currents.

Each section has a main screen with a cover photo at the top, and a row of content along the bottom.

Users can scroll left and right from the main screen through these content cards to see new stories, photos, videos, and so on.

Alternatively, with Paper, users can select a story to see it in fullscreen mode.

The traditional Facebook notification 
bar is shown in the top right-hand corner of the screen - including 
friend requests, messages and other notifications.

When viewing individual stories, Facebook actions buttons are shown in the bottom left-hand corner, including like, comment and share.

Similarly, users can post straight to Facebook from the Paper app - making the original Facebook app, in theory, redundant.

All sections are customisable and users can change the cover photo, as well as the name of sections and the layout.

When viewing content from select publications, users can filter by category and choose their favourite news outlets.

Yet unlike other news reader and RSS apps, Facebook Paper will not let people add their own links.

Paper is the first app to be developed in Facebook's Creative Labs that was set up last year.
