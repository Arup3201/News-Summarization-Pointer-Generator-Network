A tear rolled down George Osborne's cheek during the early stages of the service at St Paul's Cathedral

It was one of the most memorable 
moments of Margaret Thatcher’s funeral, when George Osborne was seen 
with tears rolling down his cheek.

Today Nick Clegg defended the 
Chancellor’s public display of emotion, insisting everyone should have 
‘the liberty to cry if they want to’.

A clearly emotional Mr Osborne was
seen trying to blink away tears before wiping his eyes during the 
moving address by Bishop of London Richard Chartres.

The Chancellor was visibly moved during the early stages of the service paying tribute to Britain's first female Prime Minister.

He later hinted at his dramatic moment of emotion, writing on Twitter that it had been a 'moving, almost overwhelming day'.

Mr Clegg was asked during his weekly LBC 97.3 phone-in if he had also cried.

The Lib Dem leader said: ‘No I didn’t but it was a very powerful occasion and very full of ceremony.’

He went on: ‘You’ve got to give any 
man or indeed woman the liberty to cry if they want to, I don’t think 
you should criticise someone for showing emotion.’

Mr Osborne and Mr Clegg were among 32 
serving members of the Cabinet who joined prime ministers past and 
present, world leaders and some of the key figures who played a role 
Lady Thatcher's downfall more than two decades ago.

Political friends and foes were among 
the 2,300 mourners who came together to mark the passing of the longest 
serving Premier for 150 years.

Nick Clegg, appearing on his LBC 97.3 phone-in, said he did not cry during yesterday's spectacular ceremony but insisted it was wrong to criticise those who did

Last week Mr Osborne hailed Lady Thatcher as 'a great prime minister — probably the greatest in our peacetime history'.

He added: 'We are fortunate to live in a country she did so much to transform.

'I don’t think that we in this 
generation of politicians need to be unsettled by living in her shadow. 
We do live in her shadow and we should just embrace it.

'She was a great prime minister - 
probably the greatest in our peacetime history - and we are fortunate to
live in a country she did so much to transform.'

David Cameron, who gave a reading during the service, was also seen wiping his eyes.

He earlier declared 'we're all Thatcherites now' as he hailed the Iron Lady's legacy as irreversible.

While the last 10 days have been 
dominated by debate over Lady Thatcher’s policies and long-term impact 
on Britain, Mr Cameron said that no one in mainstream politics would 
argue for a return to the 1970s.

‘In a way we are all Thatcherites now 
because one of the things about her legacy is that some of those big 
arguments that she had everyone now accepts,’ he told BBC Radio 4.

‘No one wants to go back to trade 
unions that are undemocratic or one-sided nuclear disarmament or having 
great private sector businesses in the public sector.’

But Mr Clegg insisted he was not a Thatcherite.

‘He’s the leader of the Conservative 
Party he’s perfectly entitled to say that.  I certainly wouldn’t call 
myself a Thatcherite.  I’m a Liberal, I’m a Liberal, she wasn’t a 
Liberal.  I’ve always called myself a Liberal I always will.’

Though only a robot can claim never to cry, no Englishman likes to do so as publicly as an emotional George Osborne did at Lady Thatcher’s funeral yesterday.

We feel a sting of shame – but then catharsis, our emotional gutters having been given a good wash.

The Chancellor was seen to wipe away a tear in St Paul’s Cathedral, visibly moved by proceedings. He later hinted at his dramatic moment of emotion, writing on Twitter that it had been a ‘moving, almost overwhelming day’.

To water up so openly might be thought weak and womanly – histrionic, even, if we contemplate some ululating Latin ever bewailing his lot.

But the rarer the tears, the more potent they can be.

After all, would we really want a Chancellor who was incapable of sorrow? In my view, it can be the making of a man of a certain age to be seen ‘emoting’ in public, when the circumstances call for it.

Recently my wife and I were at a school concert. Without warning our 15 year-old son clambered on stage and sang a solo with his electric guitar. He has been playing the instrument for only a couple of years and we had no idea he was capable of such a performance.

Claud has had a few problems in life – he has autism, which can stifle a child’s social confidence and communicative abilities.

To see our fine boy stand there and belt out KT Tunstall’s Suddenly I See, bending his spine as he reached for artistic expression, was a lip-wobbler for me. Suddenly I saw. I saw him as a success, as a lad with prospects.

Tears dripped off my cheeks, raindrops off a sycamore leaf.

Typical theatre luvvie, you might think. As the Mail’s drama critic I am frequently a bit damp around the optics. All those musicals. I have become as leaky as a punctured garden hose. Or is it age? Parenthood does it to you.

The other Sunday my teenage daughter read the lesson in church – that passage about Doubting Thomas recognising Christ and gasping, ‘my Lord and my God!’ She read it so beautifully, with such grace, I was a-jibber.

At funerals the Prayer Book’s ancient sentences as the priest enters always make the spine tingle but tears prickle when it comes to singing. Such memories can be evoked.

Sunset and Evening Star, to Parry’s tune, is how we saluted my father’s silent coffin. Remembrance Day’s O Valiant Hearts is always a challenge.

We may not know, we cannot tell, why George Osborne wept yesterday. Was it purely for Mrs T or had the majesty of her funeral reactivated some more personal sadness? Perhaps both.

I last had to reach for a discreet hanky when at the superb West End production of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time (which, as it happens, is about autism).

The convenient thing about theatres, like most churches, is that the layout of the seating means only your neighbours can see that your goggles are filling with briny. Social embarrassment averted.

Unless, of course, you are Chancellor and a national TV camera is filming your every moment.
