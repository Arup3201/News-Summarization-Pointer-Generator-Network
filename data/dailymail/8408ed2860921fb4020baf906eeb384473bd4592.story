A pint of beer costs up to 65p more in the south of England than it does in the north.

A survey by the Good Pub Guide showed drinkers in Staffordshire enjoy the cheapest ale at an average of just £2.95 a pint while those in London are forced to fork out £3.60.

Drinkers in Derbyshire, Shropshire, Tyne and Wear, Northumberland and Country Durham can all raise a toast to enjoying prices of little over £3 a pint.

Hard to swallow: Beer drinkers are forking out 65p more for a pint in London than they do in Staffordshire

But boozers in Kent, Buckinghamshire, Surrey and Sussex must drown their sorrows with the knowledge they are being forced to fork out far above the national average of £3.20.

Beer brewed by pubs themselves, on the premises, typically cost 40p a pint less than the local average, the guide found.

Good Pub Guide spokesman Fiona Stapley told the Daily Mirror: 'People in Staffs have an eye for value and some licencees go to great lengths looking for bargains for customers.

Staffordshire, known for its beautiful canals and potteries, sells some of the cheapest beer in Britain with pints costing an average of £2.95

'In the South East, big brewers used to own most pubs, which tended to limit the competition.

'But I think people in the South East are simply less careful with their money.'

The Guide predicts that  around 4,000 
pubs will close in the next year because they are 'stuck in the 1980s', 
offering indifferent drink and food, according to a new guide.

More than 1,000 new pubs are expected to open, often in former hostelries which have been shuttered for years.

Between 2,500 and 4,000 will go out of business, but the guide quotes a successful landlord saying there are too many pubs in the wrong place, chasing the wrong market.

Watering hole: The Olive Branch pub in Clipsham, Rutland, was named Pub of the Year

'The bad pubs are still being culled, just like lions pick off the slowest of the herd. It makes the pub industry more robust and far better placed for the future,' he said.

The guide said standards are improving in pubs, amid increasing vocational training among staff, but it called for pubs to name their chefs on menus as part of moves to close the "absurd status gap" between TV chefs and those working in pubs.

When the guide was launched in 1983 there were a handful of national beer brands, but now more than 7,000 beers are on offer, produced by hundreds of brewers.

The Pub of The Year was named as the Olive Branch in Clipsham, Rutland, with other awards including the best landlord (Tim Gray of the Yew Tree in Lower Wield, Hampshire), brewery (Fuller, Smith & Turner), new pub (Bulls Head, Mottram St Andrew, Cheshire), dining pub (Stagg, Titley, Herefordshire) and whisky pub (Bon Accord, Glasgow).

More than 4,700 pubs are featured in the guide.
