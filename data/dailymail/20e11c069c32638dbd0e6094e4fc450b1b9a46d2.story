Rutgers University Athletic Director Tim Pernetti was pushed out today as he handed in a letter of resignation arguing that he initially wanted to fire the school's basketball coach last year after a video revealed that he was hitting and screaming at his players, but Pernetti claims that university officials convinced him not to oust the coach.

The school's interim vice president was also fired on Friday as the two men were involved in a decision to 'rehabilitate' rather than fire coach Mike Rice whose abusive behavior was captured on a video.

University president Robert Barchi's job appeared to be safe after getting a public nod of support from the school's board of governors.

Fired: The dismissal of Rutgers Athletic Director Tim Pernetti is coming at 1pm on Friday following his decision not to immediately dismiss the basketball coach when he saw the tape

First time out: Basketball coach Mike Rice, seen here on Thursday in the driveway of his home, was fired on Wednesday just days after an old video of him screaming at players was released

Under a microscope: Many have called for University president Robert Barchi, seen here Thursday night, to be fired as well due to his involvement but no announcement has been made regarding his professional future

The day began with a letter of 
resignation sent to Barchi by AD Tim Pernetti, who said he hoped his 
tenure at Rutgers 'will not be judged by this one incident.'

When he first saw the video of coach 
Mike Rice pushing, shoving and throwing balls at players in November, 
Pernetti said he wanted to fire him on the spot.

However, he said the consensus among school officials at the time was that it didn't warrant dismissal.

The video, shown Tuesday on ESPN, prompted outrage not only on the Rutgers campus but nationwide.

It also includes obscenities and 
slurs, which the campus is especially sensitive because of the suicide 
by student Tyler Clementi, who jumped off a bridge days after his 
roommate used a webcam to see him kissing another man.

At a news conference Friday, Barchi 
said he first saw the video this week, but was aware it existed in late 
November. He said Pernetti gave him a summary of what was on it at the 
time.

Pernetti's finest hour may have been when he helped in the school's move to the Big Ten Conference, which means millions in additional revenue by way of television contracts and more national exposure, especially in football.

The move, which becomes official in 2014, should provide a big boost to the program in recruiting and season ticket sales. The Scarlet Knights will continue to play next season in the Big East.

Pernetti's first major move as athletic director came in May 2010, when he hired the volatile Rice away from Robert Morris, which he took to two NCAA tournament appearances.

‘He convinced me he understood his reputation, but he also understood where the line was,’ Pernetti said, referring to Rice. ‘I made clear to him if he crossed the line he would be held accountable.’

Pernetti viewed Rice as the man who could turn the perennially underachieving program around.

It didn't happen. Rice went 44-51 in three years and posted a 16-38 mark in the Big East after going 73-31 in three seasons at Robert Morris.

The Scarlet Knights went 15-16 this season, including 5-13 in the league.

'This was a failure of process. I 
regret that I did not ask to see this video when Tim first told me of 
its existence,' Barchi said.

'I want to apologize to the entire Rutgers community for the negative impact that this situation has had on Rutgers.

'I also apologize to the LGBT 
community and all of us who share their values for the homophobic slurs 
shown on that video. I personally know how hurtful that language can 
be.'

Based on the information he received 
from Pernetti, Barchi said he 'agreed with and supported his 
recommendation to suspend, rather than fire, coach Rice at that time. It
 was not until Tuesday evening of this week, when I watched the video, 
that I had the opportunity to witness personally for the first time what
 Tim had seen last fall.

'I was deeply disturbed by the 
behavior that the video revealed, which was much more abusive and 
pervasive than I had understood it to be. As Tim acknowledged on 
Wednesday, his decision to rehabilitate, rather than fire, coach Rice 
was wrong.'

Pernetti was given the video by a 
former employee, Eric Murdock, and the decision was made in December to 
suspend Rice for three games, fine and dock him pay totaling $75,000 and
 order him to attend anger management classes.

The 42-year-old Pernetti is a Rutgers graduate who played tight end for the Scarlet Knights from 1989-93.

Also resigning Friday was John B. 
Wolf, Rutgers' interim senior vice president and general counsel, who is
 believed to have recommended against firing Rice in December.

On Thursday, assistant coach Jimmy Martelli resigned.

What did they know and when did they know it? 
Teachers, alumni, politicians and gay rights activists demand that 
Rutgers president Robert Barchi, left, and athletic director Tim 
Pernetti join Rice on the unemployment line

Outrage: Garden State Equality organized a demonstration near the school on Wednesday, questioning why Rice wasn't fired sooner

Speaking out: New Jersey Gov Chris Christie said in a series of Twitter posts that he supported Rutgers' decision to remove Rice

Barchi's position appears to be safe.

'At the end of the day, he has to run 
this place, day in and day out,' Ralph Izzo, chairman of the school's 
board of governors, said.

'And I think he is the right person to run this place for many years to come.

'Dr. Barchi was brought on here eight 
months ago with two primary objectives: No. 1 was to build a strategic 
plan for this university for 10 years, going forward, to lead us to 
academic success and academic greatness; and No. 2, an enormous 
challenge of integrating a medical school with this university.

'Being on the job two months, hearing 
from a general counsel and the athletic director that there was a 
serious problem, I think he did the right thing by acquiescing to that 
advice at the time.'

Governor Chris Christie issued a 
statement Friday calling Pernetti's resignation 'appropriate and 
necessary given the events of the past six months.

Axed: Former Rutgers coach Mike Rice was fired on April 3 after a video emerged of him shoving players and berating them with insults and gay slurs

Slurs: In one portion of the video, Rice unloads a homophobic rant against one of his players, saying: 'You f***ing fairy! You're a f***ing f****t!' 

'I commend President Barchi for his 
decisive leadership in coming to an agreement with Mr. Pernetti to have 
the Athletic Department of Rutgers University come under new 
leadership,' he said.

'This entire incident was regrettable 
and while it has damaged the reputation of our state University, we need
 to move forward now on a number of fronts which provide great 
opportunities for Rutgers' future.'

Pernetti said in his resignation 
letter to Barchi that he has 'spent a great deal of time reflecting on 
the events which led to today. As you know, my first instincts when I 
saw the videotape of Coach Rice's behavior was to fire him immediately.'

'However, Rutgers decided to follow a process involving university lawyers, human resources professionals, and outside counsel.

'Following review of the independent 
investigative report, the consensus was that university policy would not
 justify dismissal. I have admitted my role in, and regret for, that 
decision, and wish that I had the opportunity to go back and override it
 for the sake of everyone involved.'
