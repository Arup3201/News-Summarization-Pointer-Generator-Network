A skier nearly lost her hand after she was clipped by a plane making an emergency landing on the French Alps.

The light single-propeller aircraft managed to miss a group of children but caught the unnamed Polish skier around 10am, nearly severing her hand.

The 55-year-old was evacuated to hospital via helicopter. Emergency services said she suffered a 'near amputation'.

It is not known what forced the plane, which had two passengers on board, to try and land. Reports suggested that plane had a taken-off well.

A spokesman for the fire service said: 'We only narrowly avoided a catastrophe.

'The plane passed under the ski lift, just missed the trees and then a group of children before touching down on a blue run on which the woman was skiing.' 

The accident happened at the popular ski resort of Avoriaz close to the border with Switzerland.

In Europe a blue run denotes a moderately hard route. 

A post written before the accident on the Facebook page for Avoriaz read: 'The slopes of Avoriaz are ready! Enjoy the sun!'

The accident comes just two days after two helicopters crashed in Argentina, leaving eight French nationals including three Olympic stars dead.
