He was one-month old when wildlife expert Steve Irwin cradled his son in his arm while dangling a slab of meat over a crocodile waiting to be fed.

But Robert was just three years old when his father was tragically killed after being pierced in the chest by a stingray barb while filming in Australia's Great Barrier Reef in an underwater documentary film titled Ocean’s Deadliest.

Eight years on, Robert, now aged 10, has been following his father’s footsteps and carrying on his animal-loving legacy.

It was set to go off in true khaki style, making it a powerful statement towards making the world a better place by reducing the environmental footprint.

The website for the memorial day says khaki is a symbol of Steve.

'When you see that khaki uniform, it is a sign that somebody is there to get in and get their hands dirty and save an animal or campaign for wildlife conservation.

'You don’t have to be Terri, Bindi or Robert Irwin or a member of the Zoo Crew to be a Wildlife Warrior. Anyone can make a difference. Anyone can KHAKI IT!' 

Steve inspired millions around the world to play a part in conserving  wildlife and wild places and Steve’s legacy lives on through Australia Zoo, Wildlife Warriors and his passionate and dedicated family.
