Florida authorities have confirmed the first two cases of a painful mosquito-borne disease contracted in the United States.

State health officials confirmed a Miami-Dade County female and a male in Palm Beach County have become the first two people to contract chikungya in the United States.

Dozens of infections have previously been reported in Florida alone, according to the Tampa Bay Times, but these are the first two to have been contracted in the States.

Not contagious among humans: Chikungunya is transmitted through mosquito bites

The Miami-Dade woman, 41. started complaining of symptoms June 10, according to the Miami Herald, and the 50-year-old male from Palm Beach County first reported his symptoms on July 1.

Neither had travelled outside the country, sources told the Herald.

The disease is rarely fatal, and is often more of a discomfort. It is transmitted when a mosquito bites an infected person and then bites an uninfected person. It cannot be transmitted directly from human to human.

Symptoms include fever, severe joint pain, swelling, rashes, and a feeling similar to arthritis for years, according to the Herald.

Previous cases of the disease were the result of travelers having been bitten by infected mosquitoes in the Caribbean, where it is highly-prevalent. It was only a matter of time until it made the jump to Florida.

‘We expected this. Now the question is what are the cases to follow and can Mosquito Control itself do something to mitigate whatever those numbers might be?’ Walter Tabachnick, director of the University of Florida's Florida Medical Entomology Laboratory, told the Herald.

‘It’s not clear yet, how many more cases are there to follow in addition to these initial cases,’ he explained

Another official told the paper counties will now be spraying more often for mosquitoes.

‘We’re trying to put in our plan on how to be a little more proactive with our spraying,’ Miami-Dade County’s Road, Bridge, Canal and Mosquito Control Division chief Manuel Garcia said.

‘We don’t want to set a concrete plan; we have to come up with an adjustable plan based on the mosquitoes, and adjust the plan routinely.’

Authorities expect more people who became sick from an infected mosquito to eventually come forward, but do not expect a full-on outbreak or epidemic like it has become in some parts of the Caribbean.

Reports say thousands of cases have been reported in the Dominican Republic. It has been declared an epidemic in Puerto Rico, where 121 cases have been confirmed, according to the Centers for Disease Control.

Property owners in Florida are being encouraged to drain standing water, seal screens and windows, and cover up while outside since the infected insects can bite during both the day and night.

The only treatment for chikungunya is acetaminophen and water. Taking aspirin is specifically discouraged because the disease does not react well to it.
