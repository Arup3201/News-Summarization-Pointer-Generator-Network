There are many things that can leave you feeling humiliated, but bottling up those feelings could be dangerous.

According to retired sociology Professor Thomas Scheff, modern-day society encourages people to be individuals and not let their emotions get in the way.

In the journal Cultural Sociology, Professor Scheff said shame is the 'most obstructed and hidden emotion, and therefore the most destructive,' and may have been one of the underlying causes of the Iraq war, and other forms of aggression.

Professor Scheff said shame is the 'most hidden emotion, and therefore the most destructive.' He added: 'The Bush administration may have been embarrassed by 9/11 and their helplessness to punish the attackers' and the invasion of Iraq 'might have served to hide their shame behind aggression.'

'Emotions are like breathing - they cause trouble only when obstructed,' said the UC Santa Barbara professor emeritus. When hidden, he continued, shame causes serious struggles not only for individuals but also for groups.

Scheff suggested that shame - or the 
reaction to it - can also manifest itself in larger acts of aggression, such 
as wars and other military conflicts.

'Especially for leaders, both shame and anger are carefully hidden behind a veil of rationality,' he said.

‘The
 Bush administration may have been deeply embarrassed by the 9/11 attack
 during their watch and their helplessness to punish the attackers. The 
invasion of Iraq on the basis of false premises might have served to 
hide their shame behind anger and aggression.’

In the article, Scheff examined the ubiquity of hidden shame and suggested it may be one of the keys to understanding contemporary society.

According to Professor Scheff, a society that fosters individualism is a 'ripe breeding ground for the emotion of shame' because people are encouraged to 'go it alone, no matter the cost to relationships. This feature has constructive and creative sides, but it has at least two other implications: alienation and the hiding of shame'

According to Scheff, a society that 
fosters individualism is a 'ripe breeding ground for the emotion of 
shame' because people are encouraged to 'go it alone, no matter the cost
 to relationships.'

'People
 learn to act as if they were complete in themselves and independent of 
others. This feature has constructive and creative sides, but it has at 
least two other implications: alienation and the hiding of shame.'

Scheff
 continued that while shame is no less prevalent now than in previous 
years, decades or generations, it has become more hidden: 'Shame is a 
biological entity like other emotions, but people are more ashamed of it
 than they are of the others' Professor Scheff said.

'The hiding of emotions is more widespread in modern societies than in traditional ones.'

The best way to resolve shame, according to Professor Scheff, pictured, is to 'laugh at yourself or at the universe, but not at other people'

In exploring the connection between shame and aggression, Scheff cited research by sociologist Neil Websdale, author of Familicidal Hearts: The Emotional Styles of 211 Killers.

Familicide - the act of one spouse killing the other as well as their children and often himself or herself - stems from unacknowledged shame, Professor Scheff claimed.

'It's about humiliation and hiding behind aggression or violence,’ he explained. ‘The most interesting thing about the study is there's a group of non-angry people - a minority - who lose their job and feel humiliated. So they pretend they're going to work every day but are really planning the killing. Websdale describes them as 'civic respectable.'

'Our society is civic respectable,' Professor Scheff added. 'You're not to be angry and you're not to be ashamed.'

The problem with that kind of thinking, however, is that shame is, in reality, a very useful emotion.

‘Shame is the basis of morality,’ Scheff said.

‘You can't have a moral society without shame. It provides the weight for morality. There are a hundred things in your head about what you should or shouldn't do, but the one that hits you is the one that has shame behind it.’

While some people are more susceptible to the effects of shame, for others the emotion is more manageable.

‘Those lucky rascals who as children were treated with sympathetic attention from at least one of their caregivers feel more pride - accepted as they are - and, therefore, less shame and rejection,’ Professor Scheff continued.

The best way to resolve shame, according to Professor Scheff is to 'laugh at yourself or at the universe, but not at other people.'

Most of the laughing we do in comedy is good. No matter the actors, we are really laughing at our own selves that we see in their foolishness.'
