Millions of Britons  will spend at least £650million on  Christmas presents online today in a sales extravaganza dubbed 'Cyber Monday' - but experts believe the scramble for bargains will actually peak in a week's time.

Number of online shoppers: Six million 

Average spend:  Around £110 each

Age bracket: Majority are between 25 and 34

Peak times: 7am, Midday and 9pm

Total spend: £650million - £451,000 per min

Retailer website hits: 151million - up 26%

Christmas spending: £4.7billion this year

Shoppers will splurge around £100 each on average  with spending sprees expected to peak at around 7am this morning, at  Midday and finally around 9pm.

Cyber Monday - the first Monday in December - has been the busiest internet shopping day in Britain, with UK consumers expected to spend an astonishing £451,000 a minute on gifts.

But retail experts now believe that next Monday, December 8, will become known as Manic Monday because this is when Christmas shopping will peak online - reaching £675million or £470,000 a minute on the day.

Cyber Monday has traditionally been the most popular day to order presents but the increase in same day delivery and click and collect services mean that people will wait another week before buying because they know they will get it in time for Christmas Day. 

Analysts believe that in total £4.7billion will be spent on online gifts this Christmas in Britain. 

Natalie Berg, Global Research Director at Planet Retail, told MailOnline that the rise of Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Manic Monday could kill off the traditional Boxing Day sales.

Starting again: Customers pushed each other out of the way as the crowd surges towards widescreen televisions at the Asda store in Wembley on Black Friday, but Cyber Monday could be even bigger

She said: 'There will be an impact on Boxing Day sales. While people are always keen to find a bargain there will be an element of sales fatigue because now people are starting to buy their Christmas presents at the end of November.

'Also retailers are creating a rod for their own back. Black Friday has taken off in a big way but while some businesses have been organised others jumped on the bandwagon offering discounts on everything.

Hundreds of shoppers who fought over big screen TVs on Black Friday are now struggling to sell them 

Today, lots of the heavily discounted televisions which sold out within minutes at the supermarkets, have appeared on online auction sites such as eBay

They include the 40 inch Polaroid TV, reduced by £80 at Asda, and 50 inch Blaupunkt HD TV, reduced by £100 to £249 in Tesco stores

But the sellers are struggling to get any interest on the bids

One enterprising punter is even trying to just sell the television box alone, but has attracted no bids so far

'Now it will be very hard to persuade shoppers to pay full-price for anything ahead of Christmas'. 

Today despite huge discounts on offer, there were fears that customers could miss out on the deals if there is a repeat of Black Friday's widespread IT failures. 

Websites for John Lewis, Tesco, PC World, Argos and Boots crashed as they struggled to cope with demand from bargain hunters on a record-breaking day for purchases. Shoppers had to join an online queue for up to an hour to access the website for Currys, while John Lewis had to ask online visitors to order their purchases over the phone instead. And in chaotic scenes, police were called to brawls in some stores as customers wrestled over discounted goods.

But while Cyber Monday consumers can shop from the safety of their own homes, there were fears that high volumes of traffic – particularly around an expected sales peak at midday – could cause retailers' websites to go into meltdown.

Amazon will release new deals every ten minutes while eBay will reveal new deals every hour.

Tesco and Morrisons will also be launching new deals, Marks and Spencer will discount more than 6,000 items and Game said it will cut the price of games consoles including the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Ao.com, which sells televisions, washing machines and dishwashers, predicted it would achieve its highest sales in 14 years.

Derek Eccleston, Commercial Director at eDigitalResearch said that Cyber Monday shoppers are likely to be full time workers who do not have the time to hit the shops.

Their research has revealed typically they are aged between 25 and 34 and are shopping during 'down-time’ morning, lunchtime and evening.   

He said: 'Retailers need to brace themselves and ensure they have the right systems in place so that online shoppers are not left disappointed – error pages, slow to load websites and a lack of stock information will all lead to poor customer experience and missed sales'.

There was chaos in stores across the country on Friday as bargain hunters fought - literally - for the best deals. Pictured, a staff member in Asda was forced to intervene after a customer fell to her knees in a desperate attempt to claim a TV, which was reduced from £219 to £139

In detail: Experts believe sales for Christmas gifts will rocket on several key days, peaking on Manic Monday, December 8 

Scores of shoppers looking at beauty products were shocked when a rat scurried through Debenhams.

The rodent dodged around counters in the beauty section of the department store's branch in Bedford. 

One shopper said: 'The store was packed with Christmas shoppers as it was lunchtime.

'The rat caused absolute pandemonium. Goodness knows where it came from or how it got into the store.'

And an Amazon spokesman said: 'Cyber Monday has been the biggest day of the year for internet retailers but the incredible success of Black Friday means it will have to be a huge day for that to be the case this year.

'We are ready for whatever the day brings with thousands of members of the Amazon team across the UK prepped and ready to pick, pack and deliver the millions of items that will be ordered.'

Black Friday appears to have set shopping records online and people are doing most of their shopping on tablets or phones.

Nick Jones from Experian Marketing Services said: 'It's been busier than ever. As predicted, online visits to retail websites are ahead of last year by a considerable margin. On Black Friday we've recorded a 60 per cent year on year increase in the volume of traffic, there were a staggering 180 million visits to retail websites on Black Friday, even higher than we expected, and the peak days for activity are still yet to come.

'We have identified a number of key demographic types, who are believed to be behind the rise of online sales during the festive period. Online shopping is an important leisure activity for a wide variety of people, from active middle-income families with teenage children to young singles.

'These tech-savvy groups are typically early adopters of new technology trends, prolific online shoppers, and active users of mobile and tablet devices. The widespread use of the internet is certainly a key factor in driving online sales.

'We are approaching full connectivity here in the UK and that's certainly having an impact, with people finding time to take care of their shopping on the go, in their lunch hour, or at a time which is convenient to them via their various mobile devices.'

For shoppers who are feeling charitable, Apple will be donating money to charity RED for every purchase made today to mark World AIDS Day. Meanwhile, the Charities Aid Foundation is launching Giving Tuesday tomorrow, when it will urge shoppers to give something back as an antidote to the retail frenzy.

Stars including Helen Mirren, Michael Palin, Downton actress Joanne Froggatt, supermodel Lily Cole and athlete Dame Kelly Holmes are all backing the campaign.

There are concerns shoppers could miss out on the Cyber Monday deals after IT systems failed on Friday after people logged on in their droves to get a bargain. Currys put in place a queuing system, which left some waiting up to an hour to get on to the website

Tesco Direct was unavailable for most of Friday as hundreds of thousands of people tried to place orders. It's hoped the systems will be ready for what is set to become the busiest online shopping day ever

Argos also suffered technical difficulties on Black Friday after experiencing a large volume of traffic when it reduced several items at 1am

Cyber Monday has surged in popularity in recent years, with many now delaying their online Christmas shopping until the sale begins. 

The event is popular with shoppers as it still allows four weeks for festive purchases to arrive in the post.

Sales volumes are expected to be up by a third on last year as the US event gains momentum in the UK. Both Black Friday and Cyber Monday are American events linked to the Thanksgiving holiday.

Black Friday falls immediately after Thanksgiving and is mainly offered by 'bricks and mortar' shops, while Cyber Monday falls three days later for online customers.

Royal Mail said ten million online shoppers have delayed buying presents until today in the hope of receiving discounts on their purchases. And payments service provider Sage Pay predicted that online retailers will rake in around £600million in 24 hours today.

Darren Williams, of discount site PromotionalCodes.org.uk, said: 'British shoppers have become incredibly smart with their money over recent years and are prepared to hang on to get the best deals.'
