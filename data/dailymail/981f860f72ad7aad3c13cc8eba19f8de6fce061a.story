Lib Dem MP David Ward was slammed last night for claiming he would copy Hamas terrorists and fire rockets at Israel if he lived in Gaza

Nick Clegg was facing an international backlash last night after a Liberal Democrat MP kept his job despite saying he would fire rockets at Israel if he lived in Gaza.

David Ward tweeted on Tuesday night: ‘The big question is – if I lived in Gaza, would I fire a rocket? Probably, yes.’

Continuing his rant, he added: ‘Ich bin ein Palestinian – the West must make up its mind which side it is on.’

Amid a growing storm of controversy, Mr Ward issued a statement which Lib Dem HQ insisted amounted to a 'categorical apology'. 

He said: 'I utterly condemn the violence on both sides in Israel and Gaza.

'I condemn the actions of Hamas, and my comments were not in support of firing rockets into Israel. If they gave the opposite impression, I apologise.'

He added: 'However, while I defend the right of Israel to exist and defend itself, I will continue to speak out for the rights of the Palestinian people who are facing untold suffering. More must be done by the world community to end this humanitarian crisis and protect the families living in Gaza. I can understand their plight and desperation.

'A ceasefire in this conflict is essential. If we are to end the suffering, and establish a safer society for people in Gaza, the first step must be an end to violence on both sides.'

However, Mr Clegg has made no decision on whether to kick Mr Ward out of the party, despite him being carpeted last year for making comments seen as anti-Semitic. 

Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps insisted Mr Ward’s ‘appalling’ comment was ‘essentially an incitement to violence’.

Former defence secretary Liam Fox declared: ‘Firing missiles against a civilian population is unforgivable at best, and a war crime at worst.

'That a party politician and member of Parliament should say something so irresponsible demonstrates why he and his party are unfit for office. This is now a question of ethics for the party leadership.’

Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi has written to Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, urging him to investigate Mr Ward for encouragement of terrorism.

Mr Zahawi wrote in the letter: 'Freedom of speech is an important right but it is not an unqualified one. This is especially true for public figures who have the capacity to influence the actions of others.

'Mr Ward's tweets would appear to be prima facie evidence that he has committed the offence of encouragement of terrorism as defined by Section 1(2) of the Terrorism Act 2006.

'Mr Ward may or may not have intended this statement to encourage others to fire rockets from Gaza into Israel, but regrettably he would appear to at least have been reckless as to whether others would be encouraged to commit such acts.'

His comments came as militants in Gaza fire rockets into Israel as the region again erupts into conflict

Mr Ward’s comments were made late last night.

Earlier in the day, he posted the message: ‘Sick of the mantra (that) 'Israel has the right to defend itself'. Palestinians have same right! Gaza rockets (are fired) because of failure in dealing with Israel.’

Mr Ward has a majority of just 365 in a constituency with a large Muslim population.

Stephen Pollard, editor of the Jewish Chronicle, said: ‘It’s no surprise to see that David Ward would kill Israelis. And no surprise that he still has the Lib Dem whip.'

And Charlotte Henry, a prominent Lib Dem activist and blogger, said his comments were ‘cowardly’, adding: ‘No human cannot be horrified by events in Israel and Gaza. David Ward debases them and shames his party.’

Labour simply described Mr Ward’s comments as ‘vile’. 

Mr Ward’s comments are reminiscent of those made by the former Lib Dem peer Jenny Tonge a decade ago.

Baroness Tonge was forced to resign as the party’s children’s spokesman after saying of Palestinian suicide bombers: ‘If I had to live in that situation – and I say that advisedly – I might just consider becoming one myself.’

Mr Ward's apology was issues after after the Board of Deputies of British Jews called on Mr Clegg to withdraw the party whip from the MP, whose membership was suspended for a period following previous controversial remarks about Israel and the Jews.

The Board of Deputies said he had 'shamed Parliament, the Liberal Democrats and himself'. 

Last year he was disciplined by Nick Clegg for ‘unacceptable’ comments in which he accused ‘the Jews’ of atrocities against Palestinians in a message posted just before Holocaust Memorial Day.

He was suspended from the party for three months last summer following another outburst in which he appeared to question Israel’s right to exist.
