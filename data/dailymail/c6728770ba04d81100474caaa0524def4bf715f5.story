A 32-year-old woman who was raped and killed in Melbourne's Royal Botanic Gardens has been remembered as a 'beautiful friend and colleague'.

Devastated colleagues who worked with pastry chef Renea Lau at a dessert bar in Melbourne's inner-east have told of their grief, The Age reported.

Ms Lau is a Chinese national from Hong Kong and moved to Australia in 2012.

The 32-year-old woman who was killed and sexually assault in a Melbourne park has been identified as Renea Lau - a Chinese national from Hong Kong

Her alleged killer, Scott Allen Miller, is to face expected to Victoria to face court in Melbourne today after being arrested on the NSW South Coast yesterday. He is expected to be charged with her rape and murder.

Ms Lau's naked body was found under a tree by joggers in about 8.30am on Saturday.

The 42-year-old man appeared at Batemans Bay Local Court on the New South Wales south coast on Tuesday morning - where Victorian detectives were successful in their application to extradite him, the ABC reported.

This meant police were able to question him and possibly charge him over Ms Lau's death in the Southbank park.

Ms Lau's colleagues spoke about their grief to The Age.

Colleague Steven Kearney - who looked deeply affected by her death - said the 32-year-old was a 'wonderful person' and worked in the kitchen as part of the pastry team.

'I would just like to state with deep sadness that Renea was an employee,' Mr Kearney told The Age.

'She will be terribly missed here. She was...a beautiful friend and colleague. We offer our heartfelt condolences to her family and friends and all our thoughts are with them.'

Mr Kearney asked the media to respect his and his other colleagues' privacy as they were 'grieving and working through this difficult time'

During Tuesday's court appearance, Miller was handcuffed and wore a green tracksuit, and answered two questions put to him by the magistrate.

The homeless man was identified as the key suspect in the 'extremely violent' assault and murder, and was arrested on the NSW far-south coast on Monday after a national alert was issued by Victorian police. They had been searching for him since Saturday.

He was arrested by an off-duty police officer near Eden, while camping in a small cove area and was later taken to a police station.

Police are yet to officially identify Ms Lau as the alleged victim and some of her relatives in China have been contacted. Her family will arrive in Australia later this week to formally identify the 32-year-old's body.

Homicide Squad Detective Inspector John Potter confirmed on Monday that the woman had been sexually assaulted before she died.

'This is a particularly violent assault on this woman, she has been sexually assaulted and she has been physically assaulted,' Insp Potter said.

Police have not confirmed the cause of death but said the woman died at the scene.

It is believed she was on her way to work at 5.20am on Saturday when she was approached by Miller.

CCTV footage from the morning of the crime shows a woman being chased across St Kilda Road into the Botanic Gardens near the corner of St Kilda Road and Linlithgow Avenue.

Miller had been sleeping rough in the rotunda at the botanic gardens, 200 metres from where the body was found.

Miller was born in the U.S. and once lived in an affluent Perth suburb.

In the 1990s, he was a leading figure in the illegal dance party scene in Perth as director of E-Nerve Pty Ltd a company that organised raves, The Age reported.

On Monday afternoon, Homicide Squad detectives appealed for help to identify a second man who was seen out drinking with Miller on the night of the crime and may be able to assist with the investigation.

Police confirmed on Monday evening that the man seen on CCTV footage walking along Swanston Street with Miller about 1.50am on Saturday had contacted police.

He attended a city police station and made a statement on Monday evening, police say.

Earlier on Monday, Homicide Squad Detective Inspector John Potter urged the man to make contact with police or call Crime Stoppers.

'We do not believe this man was involved in the woman's death, but it's important we speak to him as he may be able to help with regard to Millerâ€™s whereabouts,' Det Insp Potter said.

Miller and the other male were seen entering a licensed premises on Bourke Street between Swanston and Russell streets around 2am, where it's believe they stayed for a number of hours before leaving separately.

Detectives have been told that Miller was asked to leave the establishment around 5am. He is then seen on CCTV shortly after walking south along Swanston Street and across Princes Bridge.

It is believed he approached the victim at 5.20am and chased her into the botanic gardens.

Police say they have connected Miller to several items found at the crime scene.

Miller, who is originally from Western Australia, has been sleeping on the streets of the city for at least six weeks and is known to police in other states, although he does not have a criminal history in Victoria.

While police issued a national alert, they concentrated their search on the Melbourne area. They also engaged transit police and were looking around train stations as Miller is known to travel by train.

Anyone with information about the death is urged to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or visit www.crimestoppersvic.com.au.

Police have not released the woman's name, but say she is a Chinese national who was in her 30s
