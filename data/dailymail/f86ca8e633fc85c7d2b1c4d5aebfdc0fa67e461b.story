A passenger on a British Airways flight lost luggage worth over £2,000.

Nora Low was flying from a two-week 
business tip in Amsterdam to her brother’s birthday celebration in Lake 
Tahoe, California.

She was among thousands of British 
Airways passengers flying out of London Heathrow who discovered that her luggage was missing thanks to a computer 
glitch.

Let down: Nora Low took to Twitter to vent her frustrations about British Airways losing her luggage

'It completely ruined my vacation,' she said. 'I had about $4,000 (£2,000) worth of clothing in it.'

'Not
 only did their customer service stop taking phone calls; their 
voicemail filled up, and they weren’t allowing you to leave a message.'

Like many frustrated travellers looking for answers, Ms Low took to Twitter.

'I
 just started tweeting,' she said. 'That’s when I started to realise 
that there were other people that were tweeting the same. And we formed a
 little army and just kept retweeting.'

British Airways only contacted Ms Low after she informed them news channel ABC had been in touch

On her Twitter page, Ms Low wrote: '@British_Airways I wish I could just be patient but I have medication in my luggage. You shouldn't have taken off.'

'I wish I lived in London so I could go look for my luggage myself. I know it's still there. @British_Airways.'

She also retweeted other passengers in the same position, one of whom stated that British Airways didn't just have their bags, but their also 'well-being', calling the ordeal 'mental torture'.

It was only after ABC News spotted Ms Low’s tweets and she informed British Airways that the news channel were running a story on the lost luggage that the airline got in touch.

'I got a call from British Airways saying they were going to help me with my claim,' explained Ms Low.

In a statement to MailOnline Travel, the carrier said: 'We are very sorry that Ms Low's luggage was misplaced during a time of disruption at Heathrow.

'The airport teams have been working very hard to locate the luggage but on the rare occasion we are unable to find a bag due to a tag falling off, for example, we will make sure a customer is compensated.

'We have been working with Ms Low to make sure she receives payment as quickly as possible.

'We understand we let our customer down on this occasion and are staying in regular contact while the situation is being resolved.'

Nightmare: British Airways misplaced around 40,000 bags thanks to a computer glitch

Ms Low told ABC News that she received a £1,945 cheque for her lost items from British Airways and an additional £300 'good will' payment, but is still short of the £2,385 worth of missing items she says were in her bag.

'Travel nightmare; lesson learned the hard way,' Ms Low said. 'I’m never going to check a bag ever again.'
