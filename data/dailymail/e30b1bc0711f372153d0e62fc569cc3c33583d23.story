Concern: Emergency services rushed to the scene of the crash, but fortunately passengers suffered only minor injuries

Two consecutive days of rain had left the runway at Tribhuwan International Airport in Nepal's capital extremely slippery and there was dense fog at the time.

Following the accident, the craft was stuck in the grass near the runway and there was some damage to the front of the Airbus 330.

The plane, which was on a seven-hour flight from the Turkish capital, was forced to circle for 30 minutes over Nepal before it made a second attempt to land.

Turkish Airlines spokesman Ali Genc said in a statement: 'All of our passengers and crew have been safely evacuated and taken to the terminal. 

'Necessary precautions have been taken for towing the aircraft out of its current place and the relevant work on that issue have started.' 

The only international airport in Nepal remained closed Wednesday morning after the accident.
