A mother has pleaded guilty to being drunk as she lost  control of her van, plunging it into a 30ft-deep reservoir and killing two five-year-old girls, including her daughter.

Arlene Anna Hernandez, 22, pleaded guilty in Chula Vista, California to two 
charges of vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated, causing great 
bodily injury and drunken driving causing injury.

The charges, which stem from the tragic crash on August 5 last year, could send her to prison for 12 years when she is sentenced on May 31.

Hernandez had been at a 'playdate' with her daughter, Lesette Silva, and a friend, Eric Figueroa, and his daughter Guiliana on the day of the deadly crash.

Grief: Arlene Anna Hernandez, pictured in court last August, has pleaded guilty to being intoxicated while driving, leading to a crash that killed her daughter and her friend, both 5

She and Figueroa had allegedly shared a six-pack of beer as they watched the girls play at a park before Hernandez saw some skydivers and said she wanted to take her daughter for a closer look.

The foursome piled into her van and began driving along eastbound Otay Lakes Road when Hernandez lost control of the vehicle, sending it plummeting down an embankment.

The 2005 Kia Sedona overturned, landed on its roof in the water and, while the adults managed to scramble out, they could not reach their daughters who were wearing seatbelts in the back.

U.S. Border Patrol agents and passersby pulled the girls from the submerged van, UT San Diego reported. They were flown to hospital in San Diego by helicopter but were both pronounced dead.

Victims: Guiliana Figueroa (l) and Lesette Silva (r), Hernandez's daughter, drowned in the crash last August

'Drunk': Hernandez, pictured with her daughter, had drunk at least three beers before driving the van

Officers at the scene reported 
smelling alcohol on the adults' breaths, according to 10 News. Her 
blood-alcohol level was at 0.13 per cent - more than 1.5 times the legal
limit.

She told officers she had been 
driving with one hand when she saw a rock in the road and swerved to 
miss it, forcing the van off the road. But investigations found no tire 
marks to confirm this.

Hernandez cried throughout her brief court hearing following the crash last summer.

'Ms. Hernandez is very distraught about 
what happened,' her attorney, Jonathan Jordan, said afterwards.

Scene: The car veered down an embankment, flipped over and landed on its roof in this reservoir

Rescue attempt: Hernandez and Guiliana's father escaped but the girls were trapped inside. They were pulled out by emergency crews and airlifted to hospital, but pronounced dead

'At this point it is very traumatic 
experience, not only for her but a lot of other people involved. Allow 
them to grieve and mourn their children, then we’ll see how this 
case is going to shake out.'

Guiliana's mother, Natasa Sierra, also attended the hearing but stayed silent.

Guiliana,
who used the nickname 'Juju', had just finished preschool, while 
Lesette had just started first grade at Parkview Elementary School in 
Chula Vista.

A candlelight vigil was held for Guiliana shortly after the tragedy, and her father was able to attend.

Vigil: Guiliana was remembered by friends and family as 'loving' at a vigil following the deadly crash

Loss: Guiliana, known as 'Juju', had just finished preschool and was excited about starting a new school year

Struggle: Her mother Natasha Sierra, centre, broke down in tears as she remembered her daughter. The girl's father Eric Figueroa, right, had been in the crash but was unable to save her

'I know Juju is looking from above and 
she appreciates each and everyone of you that has touched her life,' her mother said. 'She 
had a lot of love to give and still had a lot more.'

Friends said the family is not judging Hernandez and offered their family sincere condolences.

'We don't want to get into the position where we have that hate. For us, it’s more of a remembrance of Juju and we want to keep it that way,' family friend Gabriel Lucero said.
