If you received a Starbucks card for Christmas last year, you're not alone. It's apparently the last-minute gift of choice across the U.S. and Canada.

The coffee giant sold over two million gift cards on Christmas Eve alone last year. According to the company, that equates to about 1,500 cards sold every minute. 

'One in every eight American adults received a Starbucks Card last holiday season,' Ryan Records, vice president of cards at Starbucks, told the Chicago Tribune.

'We're well on track for another record performance in Starbucks card sales.'

Starbucks launched its gift card in 2001, and the past 13 years have seen it soar in popularity. This year alone, $4 billion was loaded onto the cards.

The company has even enjoyed success with pricey limited-edition cards. Last year, 1,000 rose gold metal gift cards sold in just six seconds. The $450 cards were loaded with $400 credit and granted the holder with 'gold level' membership which allows free refills on coffee and tea and numerous other freebies and discounts.

This year, Starbucks is selling a $200 sterling silver keychain card, which comes loaded with $50 credit. They appear to be in more plentiful supply as they are still available for sale on the company website.

And Starbucks is not alone in cashing in on gift cards. In a November report, the National Retail Federation predicted that eight in ten of us would resort to a gift card this year.

Spending is up too, from an average spend per card of $45.16 last year to $47.87 this year.

'No longer impersonal or only about convenience, gift cards have become the perfect, practical gift item for millions of holiday shoppers,' said NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay. 

'And, as the most requested gift item for eight years in a row, we're sure there will be plenty of happy individuals this holiday season who can look forward to treating themselves to something shiny and new come January when retailers start to offer promotions on fresh new merchandise.'

And it seems they will be well-received too. An October NRF survey revealed that 62 per cent of shoppers would like to receive a gift card for Christmas, making them the most requested gift item eight years in a row.
