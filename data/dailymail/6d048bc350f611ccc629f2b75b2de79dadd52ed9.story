A former soldier who murdered his ex-girlfriend's stepmother by slashing her throat has been jailed for life.

Barach
Bandavad, 38, cut 58-year-old Judith Ege's throat from ear to ear after
flipping as her and her husband arrived at his house to collect her 
stepdaughter Samantha's belongings following the couple's split.

Bandavad had been polite to special needs teacher Judith and husband Augustine when they firs arrived at his Bristol home.

But
the Ministry of Defence worker turned aggressive warning them he had a 
gun and two knives and chillingly telling them 'there is a need for us 
all to die.'

The couple 
tried to flee the house in the Horfield area of the city but Bandavad 
attacked Judith in the back of the their hired car inflicting 'horrific'
injuries.

Bandavad denied murdering Mrs Ege on June 30 last year, but was found guilty after a two week trial at Bristol Crown Court.

He was ordered to serve a minimum of 22 years behind bars.

Sentencing
Bandavad, Mr Justice Lindblom said: 'What you did to Mrs Ege was the 
terrible outcome of a plan gone wrong. Her injuries were quite 
appalling.

'She was in the back of the car at the time, which by now had little room left on the back seat.

'You forced her in the area between the front and back seat, where you attacked her. There was a large quantity of blood, suggesting you forced her into that part of the car.

'Her injuries were horrific, her throat was cut from side to side.'

The court heard how Mr and Mrs Ege had travelled from Oxfordshire to Bandavad’s home in Bristol to collect Samantha Hines’ possessions after she broke up with him.

Ex-soldier: Barach Bandavad was polite to Judith Ege and her husband at first, but is then said to have 'flipped'

Crime scene: Police officers and forensics at the scene of the murder of Judith Ege in Highbury Road, Bristol in June last year

Brutal: Bandavad is said to have 'flipped', revealing that he had a gun and two knives and demanded they take him for a drive when Mrs Ege and her husband arrived to collect their daughter's possessions

He helped them load a hired Vauxhall Corsa car outside the house but then turned on them.

Evidence showed Bandavad, of Caribbean origin, tried to torch the car after killing Judith.

Speaking outside court, Detective 
Chief Inspector Simon Crisp of Avon and Somerset police thanked 
residents for coming forward with information about the case.

He said: 'The sentence rightly 
reflects the severity of the crime and should serve as a deterrent to 
anyone who might carry a knife as a weapon.

'All of us should be grateful to those
residents of Horfield and the surrounding area who stepped forward to 
give evidence of what they saw.

'Without such people performing this duty, we would be unable to bring offenders like Bandavad to justice.'
