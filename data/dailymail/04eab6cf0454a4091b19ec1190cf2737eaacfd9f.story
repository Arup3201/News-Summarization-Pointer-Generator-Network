A never-before-seen picture has emerged of the cabin where the Costa Concordia captain reportedly held 2am trysts with a Moldovan dancer before crashing the liner into rocks.

Married Francesco Schettino, who is currently on trial for multiple manslaughter and abandoning ship, is said to have entertained Domnica Cemortan on several occasions in his room.

The image, believed to have been taken a few days after the ship capsized, came to light as survivors marked the second anniversary of the disaster which killed 32 people.

The cruise liner was carrying more than 4,000 passengers and crew when it sank off the island of Giglio in January 2012.

Ms
 Cemortan, 26, told how she was taken in by 53-year-old's charm and would 
sneak into his cabin when most of the passengers and crew were asleep.

'I would make my way to his cabin in the middle of the night. It was all very secretive.

'I had to make sure no one saw me,' Ms Cemortan, a single mother of one, told The Sun in November.

She was with Schettino and other officers on the bridge when the crash sirens went off.

Prosecutors claim her presence was a distraction to Schettino, but she says she was more than 150ft away from him at the time of the crash.

She admits they shared a meal and passionately kissed on the night the ship sank, but says they did not have sex.

Miss Cemortan, who worked as a guide and translator for Russian tourists, also denied that their late night trysts made Schettino tired when on shift.

She said: 'He is not stupid. He is a very good captain. I still respect him so much.'

Miss
 Cemortan, who began her relationship with the married captain in 
December 2011, only admitted they had been lovers when she gave evidence
 at his trial in November.

Miss
 Cemortan told how she had first been introduced to Schettino by a 
colleague when she arrived on the cruise liner in December 2011 to work 
as an international hostess, translating for Russians for three weeks.

Survivors of the crash that killed 32 people also laid their own tribute in the shadow of the wreck

She said he began timing his trips to parts of the ship so he could see her. They kissed for the first time after he called her into his office.

She says people were gossiping about their affair but she does not believe anyone saw them together.

The classically-trained ballet dancer told Italian programme Domenica: 'When I see him I see a fashionable man, a smart man… For me he was fascinating because he was the captain.

'For the crew he was the strongest man on the ship. He is a god on the ship.

'In the first week he could not remember my name because it is not an easy name. But later he started to pay more attention to me… He started to speak with me, make jokes.'

Schettino was dubbed Captain Coward after the tragedy but Ms Cemortan said he saved 'many lives' in the way he handled the situation.

She said: 'If he was a coward, why was he not one of the first out?'

Thirty massive tanks filled with air will lift the hulk of the Costa Concordia off the seabed in June so it can be towed away from the Italian island of Giglio

Schettino denies all the charges, saying his actions saved lives. The trial continues.

Former
 passengers of the ship marked the two-year anniversary of the disaster 
by laying two wreaths in the water beside the ship which is still 
stranded off the coast of Giglio island, near Tuscany, before a planned 
candlelight march yesterday evening.

The creaking hulk of the vessel is still stranded off the island of Giglio where it struck rocks and sank.Mattresses can still be seen inside the liner and the ship's furniture is visible through shattered windows still in place.

Officials have confirmed the massive 'parbuckling' operation to try and lift it outside Giglio harbour will begin in June.
