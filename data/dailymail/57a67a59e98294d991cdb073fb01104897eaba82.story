It is one of the downsides of the technological age...the premature wrinkling around the neck suffered by those who constantly look down at their smartphones and tablets.

But beauty experts have come up with the answer to combat the sagging skin and creases of so-called 'Tech Neck' – a £65 cream.

YSL Beaute has created two products that use a special molecule to combat the loss of elasticity in the skin around the body's Y-Zone – the lower face, throat and decolletage.

It claims its Forever Youth Liberator Y.Shape cream impregnates the skin with millions of micro-droplets, creating a cushion that smooths and plumps the skin.

Tech Neck wrinkles are most often found in those aged 18 to 39 who have an average of three digital devices and peer at their screens up to 150 times a day, say experts.

But this speeds up the loss of elasticity that would normally occur at middle age, while a constant downward gaze adds further lines and creases around the chin and neck.

Meanwhile, the company's Y.shape 'concentrate' product apparently restores the skin's elasticity to lift the area, re-plump the skin and boost lost volume.

YSL claims one single application of the £65 product increases skin elasticity by nearly a third and skin firmness by 13 per cent.

Dr Christopher Rowland Payne, consultant dermatologist at The London Clinic, said 'The problem of wrinkles and sagging of the jowls and neck used to begin in late middle age.

Tech Neck wrinkles are most often found in those aged 18 to 39 who have an average of three digital devices and peer at their screens up to 150 times a day, say experts (pic posed by models) 

'But in the last ten years, because of 'Tech Neck', it has become a problem for a generation of younger women.

'Neck skin is exposed to sun every day because of low necklines, especially in women, but people are less inclined to think of protecting their necks than their faces.

'If they do, they often apply insufficient cream on their necks to avoid getting it on their clothes.' 

Meanwhile Dr Thierry Michaud, dermatologist and member of the YSL Skin Science team, added: 'Many women I treat accept their wrinkles and fine lines but what they cannot accept is their new facial expressions.

'Inappropriate expressions are due to a loss of facial volumes - sagging skin, less defined contours, creased neck.

'Restoring the facial dynamic is respecting and correcting the emotional language for open features and a fresher look.'
