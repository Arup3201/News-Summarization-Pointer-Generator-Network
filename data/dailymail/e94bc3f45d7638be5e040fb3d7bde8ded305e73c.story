What starts out as a serene video of the peaceful Utah terrain quickly takes a nose-dive in this hilarious clip.

After taking a brand new Go Pro 4 camera out to film some of the stunning canyons near Price, Utah, the videographer got more than he bargained for.

That helicopter attempted to zoom in on the stunning Pinnacle Peak - only to crash into the side of the rock and plummet to the ground.

What starts as a stunningly serene video of the Utah landscape, quickly takes a dive (literally!)

The amateur helicopter controller and videographer sent his brand new Go Pro 4 up to capture the vistas

'My hometown has been experiencing some awesome sunrises and sunsets the last few weeks and I'd been taking still shots,' says the videographer and helicopter handler.

'On Friday, October 10, I received the Go Pro 4 in the mail and decided to try it out in my helicopter - a DJI F550 with a zenmuse H3-3D gimbal.

'I drove out to Pinnacle Peak, the spire in the shot, and started flying.' 

Soon after, however, the videographer lost sight of - and contact with - the helicopter.

Before disaster happens and the camera collides with the rock

Unfortunately, the controller lost contact with the helicopter when it flew behind a rock

'The helicopter tries to fly back to you if it loses contact - it's a safety feature.

'I flew it behind the rock and lost contact, and when the helicopter tried to fly back to me, it flew directly into the rock.

'I tried to find it that night but it got too dark. I went the next day and couldn't see it at the base of the rock, so I gave up.

'I went up again on Monday and finally found it - clear down the mountain. It rolled quite a way.'

When that happened, the helicopter attempted to circle back to reestablish a connection - and crashed directly into Pinnacle Peak

Several days later, the camera's owner did manage to salvage the footage, though the Go Pro was beyond repair

While the Go Pro obviously still records - even after colliding with a massive rock and tumbling down the mountain - the lens was scratched, the camera cracked, and the USB charging port bent, making it impossible to ever recharge.

The moral of the story, you may ask? 'When you fly these Go Pros with a gimbal, you can't use the protective case,' says the amateur controller. 'And then the camera isn't protected in any way.' 

Proceed with caution.
