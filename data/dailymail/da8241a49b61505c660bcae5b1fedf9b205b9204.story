Samir Nasri has been winding down his stress-free summer with his girlfriend Anara Atanes before he returns for Manchester City training just two days after his country were knocked out of the World Cup.

The 27-year-old playmaker was left out of Didier Deschamps' France squad and it should be City that reap the rewards with Nasri at his freshest ahead of what is likely to be another tough campaign battling on four fronts at home and in Europe.

And Nasri looks well rested in a photo posted by his girlfriend Anara on Instagram.

This is the end: Nasri enjoys the last of his summer break before returning for pre season training with City

The midfielder appears to be chilling out, shirtless, in his car with his model partner by his side.

And Pellegrini will surely be excited at the prospect of having one of last season's City stars back in tip-top condition after a strenuous summer for most of his squad out in Brazil.

Nasri is expected to return to training on Monday alongside City's other holidaying stars including Stevan Jovetic and Alvaro Negredo.
