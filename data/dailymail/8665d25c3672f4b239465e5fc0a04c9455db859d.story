Hull City have splashed over £5million on the double signing of Harry Maguire from Sheffield United and Dundee United's Andy Robertson.

Sheffield United were reluctant to cash in on Maguire, however they chose to accept Hull's offer on Monday after initially refusing to do business with the Premier League outfit.

Scotland left-back Robertson has also agreed a deal to sign for Hull.

Wanted: Sheffield United's Harry Maguire has decided to join Hull

Dundee United accepted Hull's bid for the 20-year-old last week and the player held talks with the Barclays Premier League to see if the move was right for his development.

A deal has now been done to continue Robertson's meteoric rise following his move from amateur side Queen's Park to Tannadice last summer.

United manager Jackie McNamara earlier revealed that the deal, reported to be worth £3million, would see 21-year-old Hull left-back Conor Townsend move to Tannadice on a season-long loan.

In a bizarre chain of events, the Sky Bet League One club released a statement saying they had accepted an offer from their Yorkshire rivals, only for Hull to claim they had withdrawn interest after their final bid was rejected.

A club statement from Hull said: ‘Sheffield United rejected an offer from the Club five days (Wednesday) ago for defender Harry Maguire. This was the Club’s final offer and we have since entered into discussions with other transfer targets.

‘In light 
of Sheffield United’s statement this morning the board will meet with 
manager Steve Bruce this afternoon to determine whether we now wish to 
pursue the transfer after the South Yorkshire club’s apparent U-turn.’

Earlier on
 Monday morning The Blades’ managing director Mal Brannigan told the 
club’s website: ‘We made it clear that we wanted Harry to stay by 
offering him a new contract at the end of last season, unfortunately he 
and his representatives chose a different path.

‘However, 
as he is under contract at Bramall Lane, we exercised our right to set 
our own valuation of him and after numerous bids which did not meet our 
expectations, Hull City increased their offer and we have reluctantly 
accepted.

‘As we 
have previously stated, Sheffield United are not under pressure to sell 
our players but on this occasion it was deemed the best for all parties 
and now we move on with the aim of assisting Nigel Clough to strengthen 
his squad.’
