The higher a country's chocolate consumption, the more Nobel laureates it spawns, new research suggests

Does eating chocolate make you clever? 

It seems that might well be the case after scientists in New York found the higher a country's chocolate consumption, the more Nobel laureates it spawns.

The new research, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, is tongue-in-cheek, admits the lead author Dr. Franz Messerli.

But nonetheless, the results did show a surprisingly powerful scientific correlation between the amount of chocolate consumed in each country and the number of Nobel laureates it produced, he wrote in the journal.

The Swiss, naturally, take the lead, 
with the Swedes and Danes following closely behind. The UK was above 
average in the table (see below).

Dr Messerli, a Swiss doctor now working at Columbia University in New York, told Reuters Health: ‘I started plotting this in a hotel room, because I had nothing else to do, and I could not believe my eyes.

'All the countries lined up neatly on a graph, with higher chocolate intake tied to more laureates.'

It’s thought that eating chocolate might improve our ability to think as it is high in antioxidants known as flavonoids, which are also found in cocoa, green tea, red wine and some fruits.

Studies have suggested that flavonoids may improve thinking and reduce the risk of dementia by increasing the blood flow to the brain.

Dr Messerli wrote in the journal: ‘Since
 chocolate consumption has been documented to improve cognitive 
function, it seems most likely that in a dose-dependent way, chocolate 
intake provides the abundant fertile ground needed for the sprouting of 
Nobel laureates.’

When it comes to chocolate, several 
other researchers have suggested dark varieties might benefit the brain, the 
heart and even help cut excess pounds.

But to produce just one more laureate, the nation would have to up its cocoa intake by a whopping 275 million pounds a year, Dr Messerli added. 

He estimates that every citizen would have to eat 400 grams of chocolate a year to increase the number of Nobel laureates in a given country by one per million inhabitants, if the correlation holds true. 

And in the 'conflict of interest section' of his article, Dr Messerli does admit to daily chocolate consumption. Despite the tongue-in-cheek tone of the research, he added that he does believe chocolate has real health effects, although he warns people to stay away from the sweeter varieties and opt for dark.
