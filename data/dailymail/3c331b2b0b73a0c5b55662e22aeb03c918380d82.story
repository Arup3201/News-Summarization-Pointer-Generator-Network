WHSmith is to sell a range of  eReaders as it battles to counter the shift away from real books.

The chain has signed a deal to stock two eReaders made by Canadian tech firm Kobo, with a starting price of £89.

The deal will give users access to the largest eBook catalogue in the UK, with more than 2.2million titles and one million free books.

The growth of Kindle and iPad poses a huge threat to traditional book sales, which at WHSmith are down by around 4 per cent on last year.

Kobo's eReader - available through WHSmith stores from next week - is £110, offers 2.2 million books and is the first widely available touchscreen wi-fi reader in the UK. A non-touch version is available for £89

Bosses have apparently taken the view 
that the only way to counter the threat is to move into the business of 
virtual books themselves.

Chief executive Kate Swann said the 
move would complement the chain’s existing real book sales rather than 
just encouraging shoppers to swap formats.

‘If e-books are ultimately 
successful they will be incremental for us given our physical-books 
customer base tend to be lighter book readers,’ she said.

At £89, the Kobo eReader is the same 
price as the latest basic Kindle.

It weighs 221g and can store up to 
10,000 eBooks.

There is a touchscreen version at £109.99.

The readers will be available via WH Smith's 750 outlets. British book chain Waterstones has also said it plans to launch its own eBook reader

Books can be 
transferred between devices, such as smartphones and tablets.

Despite the fall in book sales, WHSmith reported a 4 per cent rise in profits to £93million in the year to August 31.

The eBook launch comes as part of a revamp at 
the chain and follows a strategy of cutting out products with low margins,
such as CDs and DVDs, to focus on core areas of news, magazines, books 
and stationery, a move that impacted sales but boosted profits.

Kobo already has five million customers worldwide and is the biggest eBook company in both Canada and Australia.

Profits from stores at airports and stations rose by eight per cent to a record £57million, though like-for-like sales fell as passenger numbers were hit by the tough economic climate.

In the United States, retailers such as Barnes and Nobles already sell successful eBook readers.
