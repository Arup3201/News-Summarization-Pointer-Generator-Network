She had appeared in just a few films when these stunning pictures were taken of her in 1952.

But Marilyn Monroe already oozed the glamour and sex appeal of a huge Hollywood icon.

Now these unseen images - taken by an amateur photographer at a party for legendary crooner Ray Anthony - are set to fetch up to £60,000 at auction.

Amazingly, the colour pictures, which show a 25-year-old Marilyn living the high life as she steps out of a helicopter, were shot in 3D, meaning when seen through a special viewer they leap out of the page.

They were taken by Lani Carlson, who was working as a sound engineer at the launch party for the hit song 'Marilyn', written by Ervin Drake and Jimmy Shirl.

In one shot Marilyn can be seen posing for admirers under the hot San Diego sun, wearing a vibrant pink cocktail dress and standing in front of a giant sheet of music.

Another shows her receiving a playful welcome from Mr Anthony.

Catherine Williamson, director of entertainment at Bonhams, said: 'They are, simply put, quality images that have never been seen before of one of the world's most recognisable and glamorous movie stars.

'They were taken at an early stage of her career. She had appeared in a couple of films but it was before some of the bigger breakout movies that really made her name like The Seven Year Itch.

'What is really special about these is the stunning colours they have retained and that they are 3D.

'When viewed under the correct viewer you can see Marilyn in glorious three-dimension.'

Mr Carlson said he decided to sell the images, which measure 1.5 inches by four inches, so that they could be enjoyed by Marilyn fans the world over. He is also selling the copyright to them.

Miss Williamson added: 'It wasn't this guy's profession but he was a great amateur photographer.

'He was just the sound man at this huge celeb party, but because of the great access that afforded him, he simply took advantage and went roaming with his new camera.

'He is still alive but has decided that he has had enough enjoyment from them and has decided to share them with other people.

'Understandably, this is something that many film fanatics and fans of Marilyn will be interested in owning.'

She estimates that the collection will sell for between $70,000 (£45,000)  and $90,000 (£57,000).

The 3D images will go under the hammer alongside the copyright to all ten stills on December 14 at Bonhams' Entertainment Memorabilia auction in Los Angeles.
