In the same week supporters cheated death when a rally car flipped during a race in Italy,  footage has emerged of another horrific crash that saw a Mitsubishi Lancer Evo X somersault in Poland.

Wojciech Szulc, driving in the 2014 Magura Malastowska rally, was fortunate to walk away with just bruises to show after his Evo struck a road sign at high speed on the bend before being sent flying.

The footage of the crash in Poland comes in the same week supporters cheated death in North West Italy

More footage shows a safety crew reacting  to help Szulc after his car appears to complete two spins before landing on its roof as it made the wide turn. 

They flip the Evo back on to its wheels with three still attached, and immediately check its engine.

Up to nine fans at the Jolly Rally Valle D'Aosta in North West Italy were inches away from being killed when a Renault Clio Super 1600 flew towards them days ago.

Both driver Pietro Scavone and his navigator Diego D’Herin came away from the crash unscathed, and  were released from hospital after precautionary tests. 

Thankfully in Poland, no supporters were involved.

The spectators realised there was a problem as the car misjudged the corner and mounted a grass verge
