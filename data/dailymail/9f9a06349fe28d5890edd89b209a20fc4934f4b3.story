No charges: George Zimmerman (pictured in his latest mug shot) will not face formal charges stemming from his January 9 arrest 

George Zimmerman won't face criminal charges after he was arrested earlier this month for allegedly throwing a wine bottle at his girlfriend. 

Prosecutors say that after accusing Zimmerman of domestic violence on January 9, the woman hired a lawyer and recanted her story.

State Attorney Phil Archer told the Orlando Sentinel that he had no choice but to close his criminal investigation against Zimmerman without filing charges. 

He was arrested at his home  in Lake Mary, Florida, and spent 14 hours in jail before posting $5,000 bail. 

This is the third time that Zimmerman has been cuffed by police since he was acquitted of the February 2012 murder of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin.

All three times, prosecutors declined to press charges because his alleged victims, all current or former lovers, withdrew their stories.

The Seminole County Sheriff's Office says the 31-year-old Zimmerman was arrested for aggravated assault three weeks ago after his girlfriend told police that he threw a wine bottle at her during an argument.

The woman didn't call 911 - but was instead pulled over during a routine traffic stop about 11pm on January 9 and told police about the alleged attack. 

Officers went to Zimmerman's house, which is owned by his parents, and arrested him on felony aggravated assault charges. 

The state attorney on Friday said police had probable cause to arrest Zimmerman at the time, even prosecutors they did not have evidence to pursue charges.

Following Zimmerman's arrest, the alleged victim refused to meet with prosecutors and 'made it clear she did not want to proceed,' the Sentinel reports. 

The woman's name was not released. 

 Following his initial court hearing, Zimmerman was ordered to surrender all of his firearms and stay out of Volusia County, where the woman lives. 

A judge also ordered him to hand over anything that the woman had left at his house so it could be returned to her. 

Zimmerman made national headlines when he shot dead 17-year-old Trayvon while working as a neighborhood watch volunteer. He claimed he shot the unarmed black teen in self defense after he was attacked. 

The initial decision by police not to arrest Zimmerman caused fury in the black community and led to protests across the country.

Zimmerman was infamously acquitted in 2013 of a second-degree murder charge for the fatal shooting of unarmed teenager, Trayvon Martin

Zimmerman was eventually charged with second-degree murder and went into hiding. He was acquitted of all charges in July 2013 following a lengthy trial. 

In November 2013, Zimmerman was arrested following a fight at estranged wife Shellie Zimmerman's home in which she claimed that he threatened her and her father with a gun, punched her father in the face and then smashed the iPad she used to record the incident.

Zimmerman was handcuffed, detained and questioned by police by not arrested. 

Shellie Zimmerman, who has since divorced George, later withdrew her story. When video of the alleged attack could not be recovered from the broken iPad, prosecutors declined to press charges. 

Then in September 2013, he was arrested after his girlfriend Samantha Scheibe accused him of pointing a gun at her face and smashing a table at the home they shared. She later recanted the allegations and asked a court to lift the protective order so that they two could be together again. 

 Last September, he was also accused of a road rage attack in which he allegedly told another driver: 'Do you know who I am? I'll f***ing kill you!' The driver declined to press charges.
