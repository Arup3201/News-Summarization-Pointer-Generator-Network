A travel company in North Korea is looking to recruit English-speakers to provide training for the country’s tour guides.

The project is being launched by Juche Travel Services (JTS), and who are offering specialists the chance to spend four weeks teaching at Pyongyang Tourism College.

The company say they are looking for foreigners with a Tefl (teaching English as a foreign language) qualification, or English speakers with experience in tourism management.

JTS believes that the programme will be able to ‘contribute positively to growing the country’s tourism industry’.

The company want to take five volunteers on trips  scheduled for May and November.

The scheme will cost €1,000 Euros - or £765 ($1,160) - for each person, with the fee covering travel expenses and accommodation.

JTS says it is operating on a not-for-profit basis, with any excess funds to be spent on the tourism library at the college.

North Korea has begun investing in tourism, with Masikryong ski resort and the city of Wonsan becoming one of the Communist state’s most popular destinations.

Western interest in North Korea has risen significantly over the past five years, with an estimated 6,000 tourists annually visiting the country through accredited travel agencies.

‘The country has made it clear that it’s looking to grow its tourism sector in the coming years,’ David Thompson from JTS told the Guardian. ‘To do so will require both international tourism expertise and foreign language skills.’

According to Thompson, volunteers will face the same restrictions as other tourists in North Korea.

Foreigners arriving to the country are usually closely monitored by the secret services, and are only allowed to interact only with specially selected members of North Korean society.

Mr Thompson said that he understood foreign visitors would not be able to wander freely in the country.

UK student, Ben Griffin, one of the first to take part in the program, said he was surprised to find his students ‘were just real people’, with the same worries and interests as young men and women their age anywhere in the world.

Griffin added that he showed his class the British sitcom Only Fools and Horses, and the movie adaptation of The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, both of which went down well with the audience.

It is a big advance for a country that has been accused of grave human rights abuses against its people.

Foreigners are often escorted around the country and closely monitored by security services.

Mr Thompson stressed that JTS maintains ‘tourism has a positive impact’ on North Korea and its relations with the outside world.

‘By building bridges and engaging with the country, you are helping to break down mistrust and preconceptions that have persisted for the past 60-odd years. That can only be a good thing,’ he said.

Although Mr Griffin says he was not allowed freedom of movement around the country, he told The Guardian that he did not feel uncomfortable with the situation.
