Watching television could stunt a child’s emotional development, researchers have warned.

Sets in children’s bedrooms or left on as background noise could be particularly damaging.

Researchers believe the viewing of one-dimensional programmes on a screen and a lack of interaction with people means children take longer to develop an understanding of others’ thoughts and emotions.

This can make it harder for children to interact with other youngsters and raise the odds of them getting into fights and scrapes.

Researchers put more than 100 boys and girls aged between three and six through a battery of tests designed to assess how well they understood other’s intentions and feelings.

This ability, known as the ‘theory of mind’, develops rapidly between the ages of three and five and allows a child to realise that others have had different experiences and hold different views to their own.

Leaving a television on in the background can be a distraction and lead to fewer conversations, the researchers found.

This, and whether the child had a TV in their bedroom, were both strongly linked with a weaker theory of mind, according to the report published in the Journal of Communication.

Long-term effects: Researchers from Ohio University said viewing one-dimensional programmes can mean children take longer to understand thoughts and emotions

Ohio State University researchers said this may be because parents who rely on television to educate their children spend less time interacting with them.

However, the US-based research team did find that children benefited if their parents talked to them about the programmes they were watching.

In their report, the researchers concluded: ‘Television may have a direct effect on theory of mind development by presenting the child with uni-dimensional portraits of characters and situations that only require superficial processing to understand.’

Dr Amy Nathanson, of Ohio State University, said: ‘When children achieve a theory of mind, they have reached a very important milestone in their social and cognitive development.

Children with more developed theories of mind are better able to participate in social relationships.

‘These children can engage in more sensitive, co-operative interactions with other children and are less likely to resort to aggression as a means of achieving goals.’
