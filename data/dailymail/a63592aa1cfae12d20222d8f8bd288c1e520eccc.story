Donald Trump's youngest son Barron made a rare public outing with his famous father over the weekend, proving that his uncanny resemblance to the billionaire is still just as strong as ever. 

The lookalike pair attended the annual Trump Invitational Grand Prix on Sunday, alongside Barron's mother - and Donald's third wife - Melania.

Eight-year-old Barron, who is Donald's fifth child, but his first with 44-year-old Melania, showcased a sophisticated style, wearing a crisp white polo shirt, navy blue shorts and suede loafers, while his father opted for his trademark navy suit, which he paired with a bright yellow tie.

Flashing the same wide smile at the cameras, the duo happily posed alongside each other for the waiting photographers, who were no doubt overjoyed to see young Barron making an appearance at the event. 

Clearly Barron is a big fan of the annual event; it is thought that it was at last year's Trump Invitational, which takes place every year at the businessman's luxury Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, that he was last photographed. 

In April 2013, proud mother Melania, who was born in Slovenia, revealed that her young son is not your average 'sweatpants child' and prefers instead to stick with the same smart style favored by his father.

'He's not a sweatpants child,' she told ABC News. 

'He doesn't mind putting on [a suit] - but not every day - and he likes to dress up in a tie sometimes like Daddy.'

But when it comes to his grooming regime, Barron appears to have inherited his mother's fondness for more pricey skincare products. 

According to the former model turned beauty guru, the youngster enjoys using the $100 Caviar Complex C6 moisturizer from his mother's own skincare range, after his nightly bath.

'It smells very, very fresh,' the businesswoman explained. 'I put it on him from head to toe. He likes it!'

The family's attendance at the sporting event, which sees 35 of the world’s top riders compete in an FEI world ranking competition in the hopes of winning the $125,000 prize, came just a few hours before the premiere of season seven of Donald's reality series Celebrity Apprentice. 

In the episode, which also saw Donald's daughter Ivanka seated with her father at the judging table, alongside guest judge Piers Morgan (Daily Mail Online's Editor-at-Large and the 2008 Celebrity Apprentice champion), the contestants were create a sell a selection of pies.

The first casualty of the season was actress Keshia Knight Pulliam, former star of The Cosby Show, who was criticized by the judges for failing to contact her former co-star Bill Cosby to ask him for a donation to their cause.  

While firing her from the show, Donald told Keshia: 'You are an amazing person, but you were the project manager. 

'You didn’t make one call that I really believe that if you’d called that gentleman he would have helped you, even if you hadn’t spoken to him in years.' 

Immediately after the show's premiere episode aired, Trump was quick to point out that it had been filmed before any women came forward with rape allegations against Cosby.
