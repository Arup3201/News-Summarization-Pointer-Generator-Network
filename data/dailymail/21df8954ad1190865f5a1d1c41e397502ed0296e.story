While Tony Abbott is in New Zealand spruiking his national security plans, it looks like the security of his job as Prime Minister is, for the second time this month, in question.

As he remains 'undistracted and undeterred by the hyperventilating which seems to be taking place at least amongst the media', Liberal backbenchers have reportedly given Mr Turnbull the go ahead saying he has the numbers for a successful spill. 

But they've said the move would have to be initiated by senior ministers from the Cabinet. 

Since these reported emerged on Saturday, supporters of Ms Bishop have claimed the Foreign Affairs Minister is against the move however she would stand against Mr Turnbull if the spill were to eventuate.

Speculation has been rife about a second leadership challenge - less than three weeks since Mr Abbott (front) survived a spill motion - as Mr Turnbull (right) has reportedly been told by MPs that he has the numbers to beat the Prime Minister. However it is believed Ms Bishop (left) is against another spill motion but will stand against Mr Turnbull if it goes ahead

Ms Bishop publically backed Mr Abbott on Saturday saying she supported the 'the leader that the party has elected'. 

'I am not aware of any attempt to bring a spill motion to challenge the leadership.' 

Ms Bishop isn't alone with rumours that Trade Minister, Andrew Robb, is vying for the role, however, Mr Robb has also publically backed Abbott, saying he had earned the right to contest the next election.

Senior cabinet ministers claim Mr Robb has labelled the Communications Minister as 'not conservative enough' to lead the party, reports the Daily Telegraph.

Reports say although a significant group of frontbenchers are publicly loyal to the Prime Minister, many admit behind closed doors, he will not make the next election.

They argue that party polling suggests the Prime Minister is 'toxic' and will drag Mr Baird's vote in NSW by up to seven per cent in some key seats.

With a state election looming and the party rife with the same instability that was Labor's undoing, some ministers are claiming the Prime Minister is 'toxic' and will drag Mike Baird's vote in NSW by up to seven per cent in some key seats.

Mr Turnbull has chosen to stay tight lipped about the speculation, instead focusing his and the media's attention on the upcoming election. 

'The question the people of New South Wales have is do they want to put back into power the party of Eddie Obeid,' said Mr Turnbull.

Federal MP Bob Katter chimed in, likening the Liberal Party to a 'pit of snakes'.

'If you've got no belief system and what you've got is a pit of snakes, that's all you've got,' he told the Nine Network. 'Everyone wants to be leader, everyone wants to be in the ministry.

'It would be really nice if the LNP put some people in government who are interested in governing the country, instead of being interested in getting promoted into a ministry or from the ministry into leadership positions.' 

Speculation is rife in Canberra about what could be a second spill in a month as more Liberal MPs are believed to have joined the 39 out of 102 who supported a spill motion on February 9.
