Police want to speak to this man about the theft

A 'lanky'thief intent on bulking up his physique' for free by stealing muscle building powder is being hunted by police.

Essex Police said the man took the Â£50 tub of formula from a Boots store in Westcliff, Essex.

CCTV footage released today shows a man strolling through the store with the tub crudely hidden in a plastic bag.

The powder was dropped in the empty EE bag before the man left the store without paying.

A force spokeswoman said: 'This thief appears to have been intent on
bulking up his physique and was prepared to resort to stealing a tub of
muscle powder to do so.'

The theft took place at about 11am on Tuesday, August 6.

In the footage the man is seen wearing dark shorts, a dark jumper with a white t-shirt underneath.

He has short hair and appears to have a receding hairline.

Anyone with information should contact PC William Chung at Southend police station on 101.
