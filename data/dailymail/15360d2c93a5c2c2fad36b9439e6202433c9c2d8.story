Last week the beauty industry was sure that singer Rihanna had bagged the enviable position of the face of Chanel beauty when she posted a photograph of herself on Instagram decked out in logo'd Chanel jewellery, bright red lips and a towel, alongside a cryptic description.

But the 'top secret' shoot must have been for a different brand because today Chanel announced supermodel Gisele Bundchen as the face of its new beauty campaign.

New face: Gisele Bundchen has been announced today by Chanel as the new face of their Les Beiges beauty range

The 32-year-old is the fresh new face of the luxury brand's Les Beiges make-up range.

The Brazilian beauty reportedly shot the campaign last spring with Mario Testino for the range, which is designed to give a radiant, natural, healthy look and enhance the complexion.

So who better to promote it than flawless Gisele? This campaign is the latest addition to an already impressive CV.

The former Victoria's Secret 'angel' is
already the world's top-earning supermodel thanks to property 
investments and a number of lucrative licensing deals as well as advertising campaigns and glossy magazine editorial shoots, in fact financial experts believe the mother-of-two is well on her way to becoming
the modelling world's first billionaire.

Rumours: After posting a cryptic photo on Instagram adorned in Chanel jewellery, the rumour mill went into overdrive about the possibility of Rihanna being the new face of Chanel

Top earner: Gisele's flawless looks have made her the world's top-earning supermodel

Chanel Les Beiges will land in stores on 15th March 2013.
