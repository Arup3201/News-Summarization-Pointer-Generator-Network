China's Ministry of defence today warned the U.S. to be 'careful in its words and actions' as it made moves to strengthen its military bases across Asia.

In a statement, ministry spokesman Geng Yansheng announced China's response to the U.S.'s new military strategy developed under the Obama administration.

'We have noted that the United States issued this guide to its defence strategy, and we will closely observe the impact that U.S. military strategic adjustment has on the Asia-Pacific region and on global security developments,' Geng said in a statement issued on the ministry's website.

'The accusations leveled at China by the U.S. side in this document are totally baseless'.

'We hope that the United States will flow with the tide of the era, and deal with China and the Chinese military in an objective and rational way, will be careful in its words and actions, and do more that is beneficial to the development of relations between the two countries and their militaries.'

President Barack Obama vowed last week to look beyond the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that he inherited to focus on Asian security risks — like China and North Korea.

'The tide of war is receding but the question that this strategy answers is what kind of military will we need long after the wars of the last decade are over,' he told a Pentagon news conference last week.

There has been growing concern in the U.S. and Asia about China's military developments in recent years.

Under its new strategy, the U.S. will maintain large bases in Japan and South Korea and deploy Marines, navy ships and aircraft to Australia's Northern Territory.

The plans outline ways to counter potential attempts by China and Iran to block access for the U.S. from entering areas like the South China Sea and Strait of Hormuz.

However, counter-insurgency operations which have been robust since 2007 when a surge of extra troops were sent to Iraq could be far more limited.

China has so far aimed to maintain an amicable relationship with the U.S. despite it being a time its ruling Communist Party prepares for a change in leadership.

Chinese President Hu Jintao has made clear he wants to avoid repeating rifts that have have previously soured ties with Washington in the first half of 2011.

Hu retires from power late in 2012 and his almost-certain successor, Vice President Xi Jinping, is likely to visit the U.s. in coming months.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry  Liu Weimin today claimed the U.S. is wrong to think that Beijing posed a threat to America's security.

He said: 'The accusation targeting China in the (U.S.'s strategy) document has no basis, and is fundamentally unrealistic.

'China adheres to the path of peaceful development, an independent and peaceful foreign policy and a defensive national defence policy.'

China has been expanding its naval force with submarines and a maiden aircraft carrier, and has also increased its missile and surveillance capabilities.

One of the biggest security threats in Asia is the ownership of oil-rich reefs and islands in the South China Sea, through which $5 trillion dollars in trade passes through every year.
