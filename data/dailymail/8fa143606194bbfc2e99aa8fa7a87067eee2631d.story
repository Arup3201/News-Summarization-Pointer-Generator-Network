A 42-year-old middle school teacher is facing charges for giving one of her students a birthday lap dance during class.

Felicia A. Smith allegedly performed a 'full-contact' lap dance for the boy as he sat in a chair in the front of the classroom at Stovall Middle School in February.

Smith ended the dance by hugging the boy and saying, 'I love you baby, happy birthday,' according to court documents.

Court records show that Smith admitted to police that she gave the student a lap dance on his birthday after the class 'convinced her to do it.'

KHOU reports that the student told police that at the beginning of his third-period class, Smith placed a chair in front of the room and music began playing.

The class began yelling for the boy to sit down, and when he did, Smith began dancing for the boy.

He said he became aroused as Smith fondled him and rubbed her hands and buttocks on his body and allowed him to slap her buttocks.

Smith told police she remembered 'circling the student while he was sitting in the chair and losing her balance a few times which made the students laugh,' reports KHOU.

The dance lasted almost four minutes and was reportedly captured on video.

Smith was charged with having an improper relationship with a student on Thursday.

'The teacher was removed from the campus during the investigation and has not returned. The district takes this allegation seriously and is fully cooperating with prosecutors. The safety and security of our students will continue to be a top priority in Aldine ISD,' the Aldine Independent School District said in a statement.

Bail has been set at $30,000.
