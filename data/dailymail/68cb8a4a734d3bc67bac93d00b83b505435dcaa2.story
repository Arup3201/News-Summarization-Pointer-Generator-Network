Javier Ballesteros, the eldest son of the late former Open champion Seve, has decided to turn professional.

The 24-year-old Spaniard accepted he would face a challenge to emulate the achievements of his father, who died following brain cancer aged 54 in May 2011.

'I have taken the decision of turning professional. This is something I have always wanted. Whether I will succeed or not, time will tell. However, I do not want to regret not having tried my best, and must give it a go,' he said in a statement.

The 24-year-old insisted he did not want to live with the regret of not giving it a go

'I know it will not be easy and I am aware of the hard work required, but I must try.

'My father had a long and difficult start in golf. Mine is a bit easier, although I have a disadvantage in that sense - everyone will always compare us and will expect from me, not what my dad achieved, but half of it, which is already a lot.

'I have set myself no goals. I will go step by step, and will start at the Alps Tour's Qualifying School. As we say in golf: one shot at a time and living the present.

The legendary Spaniard also led the European team to victory at the 1997 Ryder Cup in Valderrama

'I am very motivated and convinced that I have taken the right decision. I have a lot of self-confidence.

'Today, my dad comes specially to my mind. He taught me everything or almost everything I know about golf and I would have loved him see me turning pro. I am sure he would be very proud and happy'.

As well as wining The Open three times, in 1979, 1984 and 1988, Seve Ballesteros claimed the US Masters title twice and captained Europe to Ryder Cup victory at Valderrama in 1997.
