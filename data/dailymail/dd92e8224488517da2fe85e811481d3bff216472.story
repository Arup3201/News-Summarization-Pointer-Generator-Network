A Canadian police dog is a being hailed as a hero for finding an escaped convict hiding inside a couch.

Police in Vancouver, British Columbia, were hunting a fugitive from Alberta and had almost given up their search when their service dog found the man's hiding place.

Officers arrived at the house in East Vancouver with a search warrant following a tip off that the wanted man, Adam Harlock of Alberta, was living there.

They found no sign of him.

Police dog Lupo began to focus on the living room couch, so officers lifted the heavy piece of furniture and removed the fabric bottom.

Inside they found 36-year-old Harlock nestled in a cavity, and police say they have their four-legged colleague to thank for a job well done.

Harlock was on the run after he was sentenced to three and half years in jail for drug related offences in relation to a Calgary Police Service investigation.

'In my 24 years of police service, I have never in my career seen a suspect hide inside the body of the sofa,' said VPD Inspector Ian Upton.

Harlock is now being returned to Alberta to complete his sentence.

Officers say that his new accommodations might not include a sofa as comfortable as the one he was found hiding in.

Lupo is based out of East Vancouver and was photographed by Derek Cain for the VPD 2015 Dog Squad calendar.
