Under pressure: Education Secretary Nicky Morgan could approve plans for the first new grammar school in 50 years within weeks

Education Secretary Nicky Morgan is under pressure to approve plans for the first new grammar school in 50 years within weeks.

Senior Cabinet colleagues want her to sign off a selective satellite school in Kent before the general election.

And sources believe Mrs Morgan is on the verge of agreeing the move, which was rejected by her predecessor Michael Gove.

She is understood to be sympathetic to the argument that existing grammars should be allowed to expand by opening satellite schools. If approved, the application could open the floodgates for similar schemes elsewhere.

It is another departure in style for the minister dubbed ‘Ms U-turn’ for her less radical approach than Mr Gove, who shunned the expansion of selective education in favour of free schools and academies.

Tory support for grammars is growing, and 60 MPs have now backed a campaign to persuade David Cameron to clear the way for a new generation of such schools.

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon and Home Secretary Theresa May are also strong supporters of plans for new grammars in their constituencies.

The proposals at the centre of the move are by the Weald of Kent girls’ grammar school in Tonbridge, which wants to open a new campus nine miles away in Sevenoaks. Mrs Morgan and schools minister Lord Nash met last week with officials from Kent County Council and school trustees.

‘We want to give them [those proposing the new school] every opportunity to get this right,’ said an ally of the Education Secretary.Mr Fallon, the MP for Sevenoaks, is understood to expect Mrs Morgan to approve the plans before May’s general election.

The new school – which already has planning permission and a £16million building fund – would admit 90 pupils a year from 2016.

County officials say it complies with current law, which says any new grammar must be a satellite to an existing institution.

Another proposal for a satellite grammar in Maidenhead, Berkshire, is backed by Mrs May, the area’s MP. Research for the grassroots party campaign group Conservative Voice has found that 84 per cent of people think grammars are a valuable asset.

Supporting move: Among the Tory MPs to back a campaign for more grammars are former defence secretary Liam Fox (left), and former leadership contender David Davis (right).

Two thirds of parents say they would enter their child for an 11-plus exam and send them to a grammar school if they passed. As education secretary in the 1970s, Margaret Thatcher allowed councils to decide whether their schools should remain selective, and there are now around 160 left in England, mostly in the home counties.

Among the Tory MPs to back a campaign for more grammars are former defence secretary Liam Fox, and former leadership contender David Davis.

Dr Fox said diversity in education should be ‘extended wherever possible’, while Mr Davis said the grammar system was ‘one of the most transformative’ policies’.

Esher and Walton MP Dominic Raab, a member of the Commons education select committee, said: ‘Grammar schools (were) creating a ladder of opportunity for talented and hard-working youngsters from council estates and rural backwaters.’
