Former South Carolina Governor and current congressional candidate Mark Sanford must appear in court to answer a complaint that he trespassed at his ex-wife's home, according to court documents.

The complaint says Jenny Sanford confronted Sanford leaving her Sullivans Island home on February 3 by a rear door, using his cell phone for a flashlight.

Today he explained that he visited his ex-wife's home while she was out of town because he didn't want his 14-year-old son to watch the Super Bowl alone.

The latest legal drama came with more backlash for the adulterous politician as the National Republican Congressional Committee announced that they would be stepping away from his campaign in light of the new revelations.

Ex-couples court: Former governor Mark Sanford (left, now running for the state's open congressional seat) is accused of trespassing on his ex-wife's

Trespassing: Jenny Sanford's lawyer filed court documents stating that her ex-husband Mark repeatedly entered her Sullivans Island home (pictured) without permission

Sneaky: According to the complaint, Mark Sanford used his cell phone as a flashlight as he entered in and out of the home's rear entrance

Their decision to step back from the 
campaign could serve as a fatal blow for the former Governor, as they 
were reportedly debating whether or not they should spend millions to 
help him beat his Democratic challenger, Elizabeth Colbert Busch.

'Mark Sanford has proven he knows 
what it takes to win elections. At this time, the NRCC will not be 
engaged in this special election,' the NRCC said in a statement.

According to Politico, the NRCC 
hadn't spent significant funds on the race up till this point, paying 
only for some polling. But their injection of millions would have 
certainly came as a strong show of party support for the returning 
politician.

The news of the court case, stemming 
from a February 3 incident where Sanford reportedly was seen sneaking 
out of his ex-wife's house on Sullivans Island, was validated after he 
put out a statement attempting to explain the situation.

'It’s an unfortunate reality that 
divorced couples sometimes have disagreements that spill over into 
family court,' Sanford said on Wednesday.

'I did indeed watch the second half 
of the Super Bowl at the beach house with our 14 year old son because as
a father I didn’t think he should watch it alone.

'Given she was out of town I tried to
reach her beforehand to tell her of the situation that had arisen, and 
met her at the back steps under the light of my cell phone when she 
returned and told her what had happened.'

Before ending the statement, he added a slight, hinting that darker forces may be in play.

'There is always another side to 
every story, and while I am particularly curious how records that were 
sealed to avoid the boys dealing with embarrassment are now somehow 
exposed less than three weeks before this election, I agree with Jenny 
that the media is no place to debate what is ultimately a family court 
matter, and out of respect for Jenny and the boys, I’m not going to have
any further comment at this time,' he said.

Picturesque: The Sanfords used their first Sullivan Island home as his gubernatorial campaign headquarters, but they sold it and Jenny bought this other Sullivans Island home (pictured) for $1.5million in August last year

Jenny Sanford says the visit violated
their divorce settlement, and Mark Sanford must appear before a family 
court judge next month. The couple's divorce settlement 
says neither may enter the other's home without permission. Mark Sanford
lives about a 20-minute drive away in downtown Charleston.

Her attorney filed the complaint the next day and Jenny Sanford confirmed Tuesday the documents are authentic.

The complaint filed by Jenny 
Sanford's lawyer, Deena Smith McRackan, said that Mark Sanford has 
'entered into a pattern of entering onto plaintiff's property.'

'Plaintiff has informed defendant on a
number of occasions that this behavior is in violation of the court's 
order and has demanded that it not occur again,' it read.

On the trial: Jenny said that she is 
purposefully trying to avoid weighing in on her husband's ongoing 
congressional campaign, saying he should 'sink or swim' on his own 
merits

In February of 2011, McRackan sent a 
letter to Mark Sanford telling him not to trespass on Jenny Sanford's 
property. A copy of that letter was also sent to the local police, 
according to court filings.

Jenny Sanford confirmed Tuesday that she has custody of the couple's four boys.

She said the complaint has nothing to do with her former husband's efforts to rebuild his career in politics.

She said it was filed with the court 
the day after the incident and when a family court judge last month set 
the case for the docket, it happened to be two days after the election.

'I am doing my best not to get in the way of his race,' Jenny Sanford told the AP.

'I want him to sink or swim on his 
own. For the sake of my children I'm trying my best not to get in the 
way, but he makes things difficult for me when he does things like 
trespassing.'

Divorced: Sanford is pictured in 2009 with his then-wife, Jenny Sanford. Their marriage ended in divorce after he admitted to cheat on her with Chapur

Called to court: Former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, pictured with fiancee Maria Belen Chapur, must appear in court after he was caught trespassing at his ex-wife's house

He faces Democrat Elizabeth Colbert 
Busch on May 7 as he tries to regain the 1st District congressional seat
he held for three terms in the 1990s.

Spokesman Joel Sawyer said the Sanford campaign had no immediate comment on the court documents.

Sanford is trying to make a comeback after his political career was sidelined in 2009 after confessing an extramarital affair.

As
a sitting governor, he disappeared from the state for five days only to
return and confess to an affair with an Argentine woman, Maria Chapur.

He
and Jenny Sanford soon divorced and he is now engaged to Chapur who 
lives in Argentina, though she has been seen on the campaign trail with 
Sanford as he vies for the state's open congressional seat.

Sanford
and Chapur shared their first public kiss on the night that he won the 
Republican nomination in the race earlier this month.

Family home: Jenny moved out of her husband's house following the revelation of his affair

Space: Jenny confirmed that she has custody of the couple's four sons

A spokesman for Colbert Busch said that the campaign had no comment on the dispute between the Sanfords.

This is not the first legal dispute between the Sanfords since their acrimonious break up in 2009.

Campaigning: Sanford asked his ex-wife to be his campaign manager since they made such a good pair in the past. She declined

In December of 2011, there was 
another complaint against Mark Sanford brought by Jenny Sanford saying 
he had not made the $5,000 yearly contribution for one of their son's 
college education.

Jenny Sanford said Tuesday that the matter has been resolved but would not comment further.

Following their break up, Mr Sanford 
took some time out of the public eye after his affair coincided with the
end of his second term as South Carolina governor.

After serving in Congress from 1995 to 2001, he ran and won his first gubernatorial bid in 2002 with his then-wife Jenny at his side as campaign manager. She served as an integral advisor in all of his political campaigns.

As such, her name was floated as a possible contender in the race, using her popularity and political prowess as key factors if she wanted to run as a congressional candidate in her own right.

She told her husband that she was not going to run, and it came as a surprise to many that he then asked her if she would join his campaign.

She declined. Even after he offered to 'pay you this time'.

'Jenny was an instrumental member of every campaign, and she did a fabulous job. She'll be missed,' he said to The Wall Street Journal in February.

Now the woman at his side is 43-year-old Ms Chapur, a divorced mother of two sons who worked as a journalist in Buenos Aires.
