Aston Villa’s teenage winger Jack Grealish is set to go out on loan this month to gain experience in the Championship.

Ipswich, Brentford, Nottingham Forest and Wolves have registered an interest, with Paul Lambert keen to see the 19-year-old to get regular football having been unable to find space for him in recent squads.

Grealish is likely to stay with Villa for the FA Cup fourth round tie against Bournemouth on Sunday, before agreeing a temporary spell at one of the the second-tier’s upwardly mobile teams.

Villa manager Paul Lambert has not selected Grealish in the squad for the last two Premier League games

He spent last season on loan at League One Notts County, scoring five times in 38 games in all competitions, and began this campaign with hopes of cracking into Lambert’s first team – penning a new four-year contract in October.

Grealish has made 11 appearances for Villa this season, mainly from the bench, starting both cup games.

He has not been picked in Lambert’s 18-man matchday squad for the Premier League games against Leicester or Liverpool.
