The husband of a mother-of-two, who was been killed when she was apparently electrocuted by a faulty $4.99 charger, has spoken out about his heartbreak.

The woman who died in her North Gosford home at 4pm on April 23 has been identified as Sheryl Aldeguer, 28, a nurse who moved to Australia from the Philippines for work.

It is believed she was talking on her phone while it was plugged into the charger. Luigi Aldeguer told The Daily Telegraph his wife was speaking to a friend who was in Dubai when the incident happened.

Authorities have issued a warning to consumers about knock-off USB-style chargers and are investigating distributors of the USB chargers after the woman's death.

Mr Aldeguer has remembered his wife as considerate and was dedicated to her beliefs.

'She was the best mum and equally the best wife one could have,' he told The Daily Telegraph.

'Very sacrificial and the most understanding person in the world.'

Mrs Aldeguer had just become an Australian citizen and was about to start work at Gosford Hospital. She hoped her husband and two young children would join her in the country soon, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

Mrs Aldeguer was talking on her phone, which was plugged into a charger, when she died. The charger, which did not meet Australian safety regulations, had inadequate shielding causing 240 volts to 'arc' and pass from the charger through the phone into her body.

It is believed that Mrs Aldeguer died instantly and her body, which had burns to the chest and ears, was found the following day by friends and her landlord.

People have taken to Facebook to express condolences to Mr Aldeguer who lives in California.

'With all our love and our tears of sadness at losing her mixed with tears of happiness at having known her,' wrote Luis Chato Maneru the day after Mrs Aleguer died.

Ella Aldeguer Favis wrote: 'Hold on to the two beautiful gifts Sheryl Aldeguer gave you. Living proof of the love and commitment you shared. Haven't stopped praying for you Luigi Aldeguer.'

Police closed down a stall in Campsie in Sydney's southwest last week after a friend of Mrs Aldeguer told police that the faulty charger had been bought there.

Police seized a large amount of stock, including phone chargers, power boards and travel adaptors, which were found not to meet Australian safety requirements.

NSW Fair Trading Commisioner Rod Stowe said the rip-off, cheap chargers seized by the commission were low quality plastic that could melt and did not have insulation on pins or approval marks.

The accessory stall in Campsie faces fines of up to $87,500 and/or two years' imprisonment and Mr Stowe said it was very likely the commission would pursue prosecution.

This is the only know fatality to date that seems to be connected to the devices, but Mr Stowe said the public needed to be informed immediately to avoid further deaths.

'It's a wake-up call to people who buy cheap electronic products without realising potential hazards,' said NSW Fair Trading Commissioner Rod Stowe. 'If the deal's too good to be true, it usually is and it can prove fatal.'

Fair Trading Electrical Product Safety Expert Lynelle Collins said it had been five years since a similar death caused by a faulty electronic device but there was a serious risk of further deaths.

'Particularly with the Internet, people can buy stuff directly from overseas wholesalers that may not meet Australian safety standards,' she said.

The fatality is the first known death that seems to be linked to the knock-off charger devices, which do not meet Australian safety standards

Police initially suspected Mrs Aldeguer was killed by her laptop, which she was also using at the time of her death.

As well as talking on the phone, Mrs Aldeguer was wearing headphones, which were plugged into her laptop. The laptop was also plugged into a charger.

It is believed the voltage completed its circuit by travelling from the faulty charger into the phone, into her body, then through her headphones into her laptop and then through the computer charger back into the wall.

Ms Collins said that even without the laptop the incident could have proved fatal.

Police in the Brisbane Waters Local Area command are investigating the woman's death and did not want to release more information about the death.

Consumers who have already bought non-approved USB-style chargers for phones or tablets are advised to bend the pins on the chargers and throw them away immediately.

People are also warned not to use devices while they are charging or plugged in.

Anyone with more information about the dodgy chargers should contact Fair Trading on 13 32 20.
