It's unacceptable to turn children of suspected illegal immigrants away from public schools, period, the Departments of Justice and Education said today.

The federal government have been telling schools this since 2011, but the Obama administration was forced to revisit the issue this week after they received more than a dozen complaints from across the country that public schools were acting unlawfully.

'Public school districts have an obligation to enroll students 
regardless of immigration status and without discrimination on the basis
 of race, color or national origin,' Attorney General Eric Holder reiterated in a statement on Thursday.

Education Secretary Arne Duncan, right, and Attorney General Eric Holder, left, pictured here in March at an elementary school in Washington, D.C., issued a letter today reminding school districts that raising barriers to enrollment for children brought into the U.S. illegally violates federal discrimination laws

Schools can require parents to provide proof of residency within a specific school district. They cannot require them to provide Social Security Numbers or Birth Certificates, the departments told school districts in a joint letter.

Furthermore, if a student's parent provides a foreign birth certificate, it cannot be used against the student. And if a school does ask for Social Security Numbers for other reasons, it must tell guardians that the information is voluntary.

Not only are such enrollment practices a violation of federal law, they could 'chill or discourage the participation, or lead to the exclusion, of students based on their or their parents’ or guardians’ actual or perceived citizenship or immigration status,' it says.

Besides, homeless children often do not have federal documentation proving their citizenry, either, the letter points out.

The letter goes on to remind education employees of the restrictions on discrimination laid out in the Civil Rights Act and Phyler v. Doe, a 1982 Supreme Court case that found it was unconstitutional that found that it was unfair to 'innocent children' to deny them the right to a primary and secondary education.

Education Secretary Arne Duncan told reporters that the departments decided to remind educators of enrollment procedures after 17 instances of abuse of the law were reported to the Office of Civil Rights.

'We want to be sure every school leader understands the legal 
requirements under the Constitution and federal laws, and it is our hope
 that this update will address some of the misperceptions out there,' Duncan said in a statement.

Immigrant reduction organization NumbersUSA criticized the Obama administration for encouraging people to violate federal immigration laws and protecting people living in the country illegally.

'It just seems to send a message to the world,''We are here to protect 
those who break immigration laws and we're going to do almost nothing to
 enforce it," ' the group's president, Roy Beck, told USA Today.
