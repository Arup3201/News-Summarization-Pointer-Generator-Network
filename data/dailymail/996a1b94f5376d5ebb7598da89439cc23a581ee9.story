The man shot dead by Gold Coast police has been named and is alleged to have attacked his own mother who made a desperate call for help before the incident, police say.

Officers were called to Nakina St, Southport after 7pm on Monday when police allege that Troy Foster ran at the officers with a 'large knife'.

The 60-year-old woman rang Triple 000 to report that the 32-year-old man, believed to be her son, had assaulted her, The Courier Mail reported.

It is the third shooting, and the second fatal shooting, by police officers in the southeast Queensland region in the past seven days.

Troy Foster was shot dead by police in southeast Queensland in the third police shooting in the region in a week

Police allege Foster ran at the officers with a 'large knife' when they arrived at the Nakina Street unit

Foster suffered a cardiac arrest and officers performed CPR on him until paramedics arrived and declared him dead.

It is understood Foster was wanted for questioning about the armed robbery at a service station on Sunday night in Labrador - another suburb in the Gold Coast.

Queensland police commissioner Ian Stewart  shut down claims that officers were 'trigger happy' but said he would investigate the shootings to limit such incidents occurring again, The Courier Mail said.

The Queensland Police ethical standards command will investigate the shooting. 

Monday's shooting comes after a man was shot dead on the Sunshine Coast on Sunday. 

A first-year constable and a 10-year veteran senior constable were called to the Tewantin home after residents reported a domestic disturbance.

The Queensland Police Union said officers were immediately confronted by a violent man, who allegedly came at them with an unspecified weapon as they arrived in their patrol car. 

The officer shot the 51-year-old man in the chest.

Acting Superintendent John Bosnjak told a media conference on Sunday evening that the man shot dead was not from Queensland. 

'It's a traumatic time for the family and police, you don't come to work to be involved in matters like this.' he said.

Last Tuesday a 33-year-old man was shot by police at Kippa-Ring, north of Brisbane.

Queensland Police were called to reports of a 'disturbance' and officers later shot a 51-year-old man dead 

Sunday's shooting happened in Tewantin on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland

Speaking to the ABC earlier on Monday, Civil Liberties Council vice-president Terry O'Gorman said there needed to be a review of all of the shootings.

'It cannot be left to guess work, it must be a subject of a serious and immediate review,' Mr O'Gorman said.

'The number of shootings is a problem. It is concerning.

'Clearly there is an issue in the number of police shootings in recent times.'
