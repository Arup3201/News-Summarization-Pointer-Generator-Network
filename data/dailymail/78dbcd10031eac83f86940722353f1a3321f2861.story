A mother who knocked down and killed a cyclist while she was fiddling with her satnav has been jailed for 18 months.

Victoria McClure, 38, was driving at 40 to 50mph on her way to a friend’s baby shower when she spent up to 20 seconds using the zoom function on her navigation system.

During this time, her Honda Accord hit cyclist Anthony Hilson, 46, causing him severe head and chest injuries.

Paramedics pronounced the married father-of-two dead at the scene.

Lethal: Victoria McClure was found guilty of causing the death of Anthony Hilson by dangerous driving

Police arrested podiatrist McClure and she was later charged with causing death by dangerous driving.

At her trial, she admitted causing death by careless driving but denied the more serious charge.

However,
she was convicted by a unanimous jury verdict in just over three hours 
after a four-day trial at Reading Crown Court last month.

Judge Nicholas
Wood said: ‘You could and should have seen him. The jury was sure that 
your driving fell far below what would be expected of a competent 
driver.

‘He lost his life, a
wife lost a husband, the children lost a father. They will have to live
with your actions for the rest of their lives, as will you.

‘This
case is a tragic loss of life and shows the potential dangers of 
looking at a satnav while driving, even at an average speed.

‘No
sentence I pass will equate or make up for the loss of life – the loss 
of Mr Hilson’s life. No sentence I pass will put an end to their grief 
or to your grief or remorse.’

Sentence: Victoria McClure leaving Reading Crown Court, where she was convicted of causing death by dangerous driving

McClure,
a mother of two, will serve half of her 18-month sentence and is banned
from getting behind the wheel for two-and-a-half years, after which she
must pass an extended driving test before her licence is returned.

Alistair MacDonald, defending, said his client was of good character and
had given evidence in ‘pained anguish and distress’.

‘She
never disputed her driving caused the death nor did she say that she 
was not at fault for the death of Mr Hilson,’ he said, adding that 
excessive speed had not played a part in the crash.

Character witnesses had testified that they would trust their children with her in a car.

McClure,
of Charvil, Berkshire, appeared emotionless during the hearing. On 
learning her sentence, she looked stunned and glanced towards her 
husband in the public gallery before being taken from the dock to the 
cells.

Judge Wood said she 
had accepted responsibility for her actions, telling officers at the 
crash scene that it was ‘absolutely [her] fault’.

When
she realised what had happened in the crash on the A4 near Reading last
September she ran from her car to try to help Mr Hilson.

The judge told her: ‘Witnesses said you were in shock and very distressed and crying.

Scene: The A4 Bath Road near Twyford, where the crash took place

‘Your
mitigation reduces the sentence below the sentencing range but it 
cannot enable me to suspend the sentence. Your driving created a serious
risk of danger.

‘You drove while avoidably distracted by a satnav and failed to have a proper regard to a cyclist – a vulnerable road user.’

After
the hearing, Sergeant Jim Lovell of the Thames Valley Police road death
team made a statement on behalf of the force and Mr Hilson’s family.

He said: ‘This has been a tragic and emotional case.

‘All of us should reflect upon the devastation this has had upon the Hilson family.

‘They have shown great strength and respect throughout, as I know how much of an impact on their lives this has had.

‘Regardless
of the sentence today, the family are relieved it is now over. They can
concentrate on trying to move forward and rebuilding their lives.

‘It is worth reminding every motorist again to pay extra attention to all vulnerable road users.’
