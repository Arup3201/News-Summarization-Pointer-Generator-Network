A Down's Syndrome man who suffocated to death 
while being arrested by police for refusing to leave a movie theater idolized law enforcement, it was revealed today.

Robert Ethan Saylor, 26, was an avid follower of TV show NCIS and was so interested in the police that he would regularly call 911 so they would come to the house so he could to talk to them.

But on January 12, he died following a confrontation with the very people he idolized, after he asphyxiated as three police officers tried to restrain him at a theater in Frederick, Maryland.

Loss: Robert Ethan Saylor, who died in police custody, was said to be obsessed with law enforcement

Saylor had been watching Zero Dark Thirty at the cinema with a health aide and when it finished, he wanted to watch it again and refused to leave.

A cinema employee called three off-duty sheriff's deputies - Lt. Scott Jewell, Sgt. Rich Rochford and Deputy 1st Class James Harris - who were working a security job at a nearby shopping center.

When the officers, who were not wearing police uniforms, approached Saylor and tried to arrest him, he began lashing out.

They handcuffed him and allegedly his face was put to the ground as he was being apprehended, ABC News reported. The officers then realised he was suffering a 'medical emergency'.

The officers removed the handcuffs, administered first aid and took him to Frederick Memorial Hospital where he later died.

'Ethan
 was developmentally disabled, not a criminal,' Joseph Espo, a lawyer 
representing Saylor's parents, Patti and Ron Saylor, told the Washington
 Post.

'He was 
entranced by police and police departments and liked communicating with 
them to the extent that, if there was ever a complaint, it was that he'd
 call so they could come to the house so he could talk to them.'

Saylor's
 mother took cookies to the sheriff’s office last year to thank the 
deputies for all the trips they made to the house, Espo told the Post.

The
 three deputies have all been placed on administrative leave and have 
exercised their right as law enforcement officers not to give statements
 to investigators.

Tragic: Saylor was taken to Frederick Memorial
 Hospital by officers and later died from his injuries

Saylor's mother, Patti Saylor, told the ABC her son should never have been arrested.

'He has never had anyone put their hands on him in their life,' says Patti Saylor. 'He would not have been doing anything threatening to anybody.'

Authorities say they are investigating the incident.

Saylor, often known by his middle name Ethan, was said to be a 'cherished member of Damascus Road Community Church' where he was a popular member of the men's choir.
