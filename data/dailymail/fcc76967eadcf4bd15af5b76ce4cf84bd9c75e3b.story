A drunken passenger managed to sneak on to an empty plane unnoticed before being found in the toilet by cleaners, and claiming to be the co-pilot.

The
 shocking breach of security happened at Birmingham Airport after the 
man entered the airfield at around 1am last Thursday.

Lee Jezard, 22, from Evesham, Worcester, arrived at
 Birmingham Airport too late to catch his 7.30pm flight to Ibiza for a 
lads holiday with five of his friends.

Rule-breaker: Twenty-two year old Lee Jezard said he wanted to expose a lapse in airport security

He was re-booked on the first flight out the next morning but didn't have enough money to stay in a hotel so got drunk in an airport bar.

He then decided to go downstairs and crawled along the conveyor behind the check-in desks until he ended up on the airfield.

Yesterday, Lee, who is a duty manager at The Wood Norton Hotel, said: 'I turned up late so I missed my flight to Ibiza but my bags were already on it because my mates had checked them in.

'They gave me a flight the next morning and I went to the bar and got absolutely slaughtered to be honest. I had one too many.

'I went downstairs and it was quite empty with just a few cleaners around and I thought "this doesn't look very secure".

'I wondered if I could expose a lapse in their security and got on the conveyor belt behind the check-in desks.

'I made it through and it looks like a factory back there, it is absolutely massive.

'I got on to the airfield and there was a plane there with steps going up to it and I went up and there was a cleaner in there.

Lee Jezard, centre, pictured with friends, said he tried to convince a cleaner on board the aircraft that he was the co-pilot

'I was trying to convince him I was the co-pilot. He believed it for a minute but then he called police and they arrested me.

'My response after being arrested was I just did it to prove how bad airport security is.

'It's a good job I am not a terrorist. It's funny to my mates but I suppose it isn't funny for the airport.

'I couldn't believe how easily I got through, no-one stopped me or confronted me once between the check-in desk and the airfield.

'They said they would have to shut down the airport and search everywhere.

'The police who arrested me didn't even know what to arrest me on, they had to go and print something off.'

A source at the airport said it was one of the most dramatic security breaches they had ever witnessed

Lee was unable to join his pals in Ibiza and is now on a no-fly list until he appears at Birmingham Magistrates Court next month.

Speaking about what he found behind the scenes at the airport, he added: 'After you go through the shutters you go up and it is massive.

'There is loads of conveyor belts going off in all different directions but I just went straight.

'It goes up and down and then there was a ladder I got off on and the shutters were all open and I found myself on the airfield.

'I couldn't quite believe what I was doing.'

Lee managed to avoid security by climbing though the conveyor belt used for luggage behind the closed check-in desks

Yesterday West Midlands Police confirmed a 22-year-old was arrested at the scene.

He has been charged with entering a 
security restricted area of an aerodrome without the permission of the 
manager and boarding an aircraft without permission.

A
 source at the airport, who exposed the security breach
blasted bosses and said: 'It is such an incredible breach of security, one of the biggest I have ever heard of at a British airport.

'He could have been a terrorist, he could have been anybody at all. It is scary that this was allowed to happen.

'He could have done anything to that plane or another plane, they must have had to do a lot of checks afterwards.

'The check-in desks would have been closed by that time but the baggage flaps should be locked and secured.

'It is unthinkable that someone managed to climb through there without being spotted on the CCTV cameras.

'You
 have seen things abroad where a person has made it on to the airfield 
but I have never heard of it happening in Britain. It is terrifying 
really.'

A spokeswoman for West Midlands Police said Mr Jezard was arrested at around 1.10am last Thursday at the airport.

She said: 'He was charged later that day with the offence of entering a security restricted area of an aerodrome without the permission of the manager and a separate offence of boarding an aircraft without permission.

'He was released on bail, with conditions not to attend any airport in the UK, and is due to appear before Birmingham Magistrates on 20 August.'

A spokesperson for Birmingham Airport, added: 'We can confirm that a man was arrested by West Midlands Police at Birmingham Airport during the early hours of Thursday 17th July and was later charged.'

Birmingham Airport had been celebrating on Tuesday morning when the first jet arriving from China touched down following the opening of the airport's Â£40million runway extension.

The 248-seat Airbus A330-200 arrived from Beijing and was the first jet to land on the new lengthened runway.

It then took off again a few hours later on the inaugural Birmingham to Beijing flight - becoming the only direct air link between China and a UK destination outside London.
