This is the terrifying moment a gunman casually strolled down a road carrying a pistol which he had threatened to shoot two officers with.

Armed police swooped on the man in Much Wenlock, Shropshire, after he was seen 'calmly' walking down a road smoking a cigarette as he held the weapon.

He then attempted to force his way into 
what is believed to be a serving policeman's former home before 
trained marksmen fired a shot in his direction - which missed.

A police dog was then released which tackled the gunman so that officers could make an arrest.

The man, in his 50s, was then taken into 
custody at Malinsgate Police Station, Telford, Shropshire, following the incident on Easter Sunday.

He has since been detained under the Mental Health Act.

The weapon was a handgun and police forensic experts are carrying out tests to establish whether it was working.

Terrified parent Jane Shepherd, 37, captured the gunman on camera as he walked past her house.

The mother-of-three said her eight-year-old son William, had been playing outside with his friends building snowmen when the man walked past holding the weapon.

She said: 'Police officers ran up to them and screamed at them to get indoors.

'My son ran in and said "mum there's a man with a gun outside" and I obviously didn't believe him - I thought April Fool's Day had come early.

'But then I looked outside and I saw a man at the foot of my front garden holding a pistol and smoking a cigarette.

'He was as cool as a cucumber. At one point the police were hiding behind my car.

Chase: Police marksmen who were 'on the scene in seconds' after the gunman was seen strolling down the road

'They shot at him after he raised the pistol.

'I couldn't believe it when I just watched him mooch past the door holding a gun like he had no care in the world.

'Armed police were there in seconds, they shot but missed him and then they set the dog on him. It's a miracle nobody was hurt - because he was waving the weapon around like it was a plaything.'

Mrs Shepherd who runs a construction company and has three children Katie, 10, William, eight, and George, five, added: 'I worked in London and I'm from Essex but I came up here because it is quiet and peaceful.

'Nothing like that has happened here before, it's usual so rural and tranquil and everybody is deeply shocked.'

West Mercia Police have now referred the case to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

A force spokesman said: 'A shot was fired by an armed officer but no one was injured in the incident.

'Armed
officers and dog units were called in and at 4.25pm, the man was 
approached as he attempted to enter a property in Stretton Road.

'Again, he appeared to threaten them with a handgun and a shot was fired by an armed officer.

'The round did not hit the man and he was arrested shortly after being tackled by a police dog.

'As in all such firearms incidents, the matter has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.'

The
spokesman added that the handgun was being examined by their Forensic 
Science Firearms Laboratory team to 'establish what it was capable of'.
