The images of Germany celebrating their fourth World Cup triumph in the Maracana Stadium on Sunday evening will live long in the memory.

Sadly, so too will the pictures of Joe Hart and Jack Wilshere tearing it up in Las Vegas after England’s latest tournament humiliation.

Naturally these alarming pictures are amplified by the joyous scenes in Rio de Janeiro. Those German boys are entitled to celebrate.

They are World Cup winners, footballing gods after reaching their tournament target.

What
 of Wilshere and Hart then? In one image, reminiscent of Paul 
Gascoigne’s infamous experience in the Dentist’s Chair at the China Jump
 Club in Hong Kong back in 1996, a friend pours what looks like 
champagne down Wilshere’s throat.

The
 two players have been in Las Vegas partying with friends before they 
return to Manchester City and Arsenal for pre-season training. It is not
 becoming of England internationals.

In
 other pictures, Wilshere is holding a cigarette and a cigar in the 
pool, puffing away without a care in the world. His career is 
threatening to go up in smoke.

As
 Joachim Low explained after Mario Gotze’s stunning 113th-minute winner 
against Argentina, this victory has been in production for more than 10 
years. Germany’s coach stitched it all together.

England’s team is falling apart at the seams, underscored by their lamentable performances at this World Cup.

Let
 us not forget that they were out of this tournament before 12 teams had
 even played their second group game. Why couldn’t they have kept a low 
profile now?

The FA continue
 to maintain that this is all part of a special plan, that this group of
 players are on the verge of something special. No, they are not.

They
 are young men, many of whom are ill-disciplined and ill-advised, no 
better illustrated than by the latest round of party pictures.

If
 we are to believe these England players want success at World Cups or 
European Championships as much as they tell us, then they have to change
 their refuelling habits.

CRIME SHEET

AUGUST 2010Involved in a fracas outside a London nightclub, which left a woman with a broken arm. Wilshere was arrested and bailed but faced no charges. He received a caution for common assault, though a spokesman insisted he acted as peacemaker.

MARCH 2011Wilshere received a police warning for trying to spit on a cab driver wearing a Spurs hat. The midfielder, who was drunk, later apologised.

JULY 2012Wilshere was warned by UEFA after tweeting about betting during an Arsenal Champions League game. UEFA regulations state players cannot bet on games involving their own teams.

INJURY LIST

JULY 2011 Limped out of a pre-season friendly with a stress fracture on his right ankle.

FEBRUARY 2012 Suffered a second stress fracture to the heel of same foot.

MAY 2012 Knee injury slowed his rehabilitation and eventually he required surgery, which kept him out for four more months.

MARCH 2013 Inflamed left ankle saw him miss a Champions League game and two World Cup qualifiers. 

MAY 2013 Had surgery to remove a pin in his right ankle and missed two England’s friendlies.

MARCH 2014 Hairline fracture in his left foot ruled him out for six weeks.

Top-class athletes cannot sustain these lifestyles and they should not seek them out either.

It
 was only a year ago that England’s captain Steven Gerrard claimed 
Wilshere was a ‘world-class talent’ and even went on to say that the 
Arsenal midfielder could succeed him as skipper.

With
 a ball at his feet, no-one doubts that Wilshere is a gifted individual,
 but boozing it up in bars and smoking like a trooper is no way to 
fulfil that talent.

Last 
October, Wilshere, who earns around £50,000 a week, assured Arsene 
Wenger, his manager at Arsenal, that it was a ‘one off’ when he was 
pictured smoking on a night out in London.

‘I
 made a mistake. Players make mistakes. I’m not a smoker,’ he told 
Arsenal’s official website. ‘I spoke to the boss and he asked me what 
happened. I explained it to him and we sorted it out. He put me in the 
team and hopefully I repaid him.’

Don’t
 forget, in the hours that  followed Arsenal’s FA Cup victory, he was 
caught on camera responding to supporters singing ‘What do we think of 
Tottenham’ by shouting ‘****!’.

Caught: Jack was photographed smoking a cigarette outside Dstrkt nightclub in October last year

No biggie, but Wilshere needs to straighten himself out if he is to go on to have a first-class playing career. He is 22 now.

When
 Arsenal play their opening  fixture against Crystal Palace in the 
Barclays Premier League on August 16, Wilshere will be fighting for his 
place — and it is getting congested in there.

Mesut
 Ozil, a World Cup winner now, new signing Alexis Sanchez, Aaron Ramsey,
 Mikel Arteta, Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain are all battling
 it out. Wilshere has a big  season ahead and this gem of a player is no
 longer guaranteed a start in a mediocre England squad.

He
 is not alone. It was only a couple of weeks ago that Sunderland 
striker  Connor Wickham was pictured with his pals in Puerta Banus, 
Marbella, with the receipt for a £17,500, 15-litre bottle of Armand de 
Brignac champagne.

Anger: His Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was furious with the England midfielder for smoking in October

If he 
wanted it badly enough, Wickham — who has represented England at Under 
16, 17, 19 and 21 levels — would be a full international. He has the  
talent, but not the aptitude. At this rate, there is not a chance that 
he will be considered for the England squad.

Back
 to Hart. At the Lions and Roses charity dinner on May 18, England’s 
head coach Roy Hodgson allowed his players to have a couple of drinks.

On
 one table, Gerrard and Lampard had half a glass of red wine poured for 
them and did not touch a drop. On another, far more  boisterous table, 
Hart drank bottle after bottle of beer at a remarkable rate.

Sitting
 on the same table was Luke Shaw, a young man who cannot even drive yet,
 at his first official England function. At the time he was 18. What 
an  example to set a kid,

Trouble brewing? Jack assured Arsene Wenger (left) his last smoking episode was a 'one off'

Disappointing: Jack had a frustrating World Cup as England crashed out in the group stage

Hart’s
 boozing was Shaw’s introduction to what it means to be part of an 
England squad preparing for the World Cup. It felt, and looked,  like 
the keeper’s last big blow-out before the tournament.

The next day England’s first-choice goalkeeper trained with the rest of his team-mates. Some preparation that is.

Can
 you imagine Manuel Neuer slugging back a few beers before the World Cup
 in the same way with the Germany national team? Not on your life.

Neuer
 and his team-mates have  committed their lives to being the best they 
can be. And they have made the necessary sacrifices to achieve their 
ambitions on the field.

As ever with England, they are  pouring it all away.
