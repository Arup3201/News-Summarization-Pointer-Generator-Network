A couple have been convicted of stealing the life savings of an 
elderly dementia sufferer to buy themselves a new car, a home gym and wet room in a two-year spending spree.

Lesley Reeve, 56, and husband Andrew, 55, spent all but £3,000 of her godmother Joan Killen’s £130,000 savings after the pensioner was moved into care and allowed him to become a signatory on her bank accounts.

The couple cleared debts, bought a car and spent thousands on electrical goods and presents for themselves, Teesside Crown Court has heard.

They also spent some of the cash on converting the garage of their home in Chichester Close, Hartlepool, into a wet room and gym.

But the couple were caught out when police launched an investigation after Miss Skillen's care home realised the pensioner was always short of money.

When 
the couple were arrested last year, they claimed the garage conversion on their 
four-bedroom property had been carried out so that the pensioner, who had been placed in care in 2009, could 
move in with them when she recovered.

But a planning application submitted to the council detailed installing a gym and a wet room – and made no mention of a bedroom.

The pair maintained throughout their trial that Miss Killen was 'ecstatic' when they asked her to move 
in -  claiming she had told them to spend her money how they liked.

That story was rejected by a jury, 
who convicted them of stealing £95,000 in savings as well as the theft of rent 
money they made from getting a tenant to move into Miss Killen's property when she
went into a care home after a fall.

An unemployed oil company receptionist Mrs Reeve, who collapsed in the dock, was convicted of stealing £2,940 in pension payments.The couple were cleared of stealing a winter fuel payment of £150.

While
they were spending up to £2,500 of the godmother’s savings a week at 
one point in 2009, the Reeves, who have sons aged 27 and 24, were 
sending her a weekly allowance of just £9.13 when she was in the care 
home, the court heard.

Their sons sobbed in the public gallery when the guilty verdicts were returned.

The court heard how the pair, from Hartlepool, took over Mrs Killen’s finances when the spinster was taken into a care home in 2009 with dementia.

Prosecutor
Matthew Bean told the jury how Mrs Killen was left without pocket 
money while her goddaughter and her husband spent her savings 
within just two years.

More 
than £11,000 went on paying off Mrs Reeve’s credit card bill while the 
couple also bought a car, revamped their £220,000 detached home and 
added new furniture.

The court was told how the couple spent money at Next, Marks and Spencer and Argos.

Opening
the case, barrister Mr Bean told the jury: ‘The prosecution say that 
this money was taken from her account in order for them to spend it on 
themselves.

'The 
prosecution say the money was used to pay for the conversion at their 
house... and also used by the defendants to buy a car, furnishings 
and electrical equipment.

‘We ask you to look at this woman’s mental health.

‘It shows she was vulnerable and suffering from a gradual deterioration in her capacity due to the onset of dementia.

deteriorate

‘The
prosecution say both defendants must have been well aware of this and 
decided to take advantage of her vulnerability by taking and spending 
her life savings.’

The 
court heard that Mrs Killen had ‘substantial’ savings of more than 
£130,000 in January 2009, but within two years there was just over 
£3,000 left in her accounts.

Hartlepool council
officials launched an investigation after realising the care home 
resident was often left without pocket money and did not have enough to 
meet her bills.

Mr Reeve 
twice ignored letters to provide detailed bank statements, said Mr Bean,
because he knew there was little left and the discovery of that could 
lead to police involvement.

Soon
after, small amounts of money were transferred back into the 
pensioner’s accounts in a cynical attempt to hide the thefts, the 
prosecutor said.

Leaving court: The couple were released on bail until their sentencing hearing

After their arrests, the couple denied
acting dishonestly and claimed they had been given permission by the 
woman to spend the money.

Mr
Bean said their victim had no close relatives visiting her and although
her goddaughter was not a blood relative, she and her husband were in 
line to inherit almost all of her possessions anyway.

But
he told the jury it was ‘no coincidence’ that transfers back into the 
godmother’s account began only after the Reeves were told of the council
investigation.

The court 
also heard that within weeks of the woman being taken into temporary 
care, her home was stripped of a stairlift and warden alarms despite Mr 
Reeve being told she may return.

The
house was then let by the couple who had the rent and payment for 
utility bills paid directly into their accounts along with the elderly 
woman’s pension and winter fuel allowance.

The 
Recorder of Middlesbrough Judge Simon Bourne-Arton granted the couple 
bail to allow reports to be prepared ahead of sentencing.

After the case, Detective Inspector Dave Turnbull from the Cleveland Police Economic Crime Unit said: 'Today's result has brought a satisfactory conclusion to the first stage of what has proven to be a very difficult investigation.

'As the victim was unable to give evidence, it had to be proved by other means and credit for this must go to the investigating officer, Detective Constable Rachel Graham.

'Mr and Mrs Reeve took full advantage of a vulnerable lady and have spent her money entirely for their own benefit, which has left the victim with little left.

'We will now commence an investigation to recover the proceeds of the crime.'

A council spokesman said: 'Hartlepool Council is committed to protecting vulnerable people in the local community, and this includes the identification of financial and property abuse.

'Our staff have worked extremely hard on this case and welcome today's verdict.'
