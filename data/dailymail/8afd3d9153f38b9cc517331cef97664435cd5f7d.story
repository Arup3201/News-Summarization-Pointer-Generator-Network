As far as adrenaline kicks go, you might have thought paragliding up to 2,500ft before plunging through the air at 125mph would be enough for even the most adventurous thrill-seeker.

But not for daredevil Sebastian Alvarez who decided to up the ante by using his wingsuit to fly between two residential tower-blocks in Chile which are just 40ft apart.

Despite completing 800 jumps in the past, even adrenaline junkie Alvarez admitted he was nervous before his latest stunt.

Daredevil Sebastian Alvarez has filmed himself flying between two tower blocks in his hometown in Chile

The adrenaline junkie paraglided up to 2,500ft before plunging between the buildings at more than 125mph

The residential flat blocks are located in Alvarez' home town of Renaca, a city in central Chile

'I'm always fearful but I don't let that emotion overwhelm me,' Alvarez said. 'I felt focused in the air, not distracted by anything else.

'I felt a huge sense of accomplishment and relief after the jump. I was just so happy it all went as planned and grateful for everyone's help.'

After passing between the building in his hometown of Renaca, Chile, Alvarez deployed a parachute on the back of his Vampire 2 Wingsuit before floating down to Earth.

Alvarez has developed a reputation for Wingsuit proximity flying - essentially travelling through small gaps while flying at tremendous speed using one of the suits.

In another of his videos on YouTube, Alvarez captured the moment he flew down a narrow cliff trench in Walenstadt, Switzerland.

His motto, posted on his Facebook page, is: 'Push it hard, know your limits, be crazy as hell, respect experience, 
enjoy your friends, fall in love, keep nature and FLYFAST!!'

Alvarez then shot between the buildings, which are just 40ft apart, at almost 125miles an hour (pictrued: the view from the back of Alvarez' helmet)
