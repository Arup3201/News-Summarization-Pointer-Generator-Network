Long battle: Former school dinner lady Carol Hill has won the right to compensation two years after winning a claim for wrongful dismissal

A school dinner lady who was sacked after telling a seven-year-old girl's parents about a 'brutal' bullying incident has won her two-year battle to get compensation for wrongful dismissal.

Carol Hill, 61, was devastated when she was suspended from Great Tey Primary School in Colchester, Essex, after she inadvertently told a pupil's parents about the bullying in June 2009.

Mrs Hill spoke to the press about her shock at her suspension and was then sacked in September 2009 by the headteacher for 'breach of confidentiality'.

Mrs Hill then began her campaign for justice.

As the Mail reported at the time, Mrs Hill - who supervised pupils' games at lunchtime - had gone to the aid of a seven-year-old girl who had been tied to a fence and whipped with a skipping rope by four children.

When Mrs Hill later bumped into the schoolgirl’s parents at a Beaver Scouts meeting, she assumed they had been told and asked how she was – only to discover they had been informed she had suffered a ‘minor accident’.

The girl — who had rope burns on her wrist and red welts on her thigh — had been sent home with a note for her parents stating only that she had been hurt in a 'skipping rope incident'.

An employment tribunal in January 2011 found Mrs Hill had been unfairly dismissed but her compensation was cut at a second hearing because she had spoken to the press about her ordeal.

However, an employment appeal tribunal has found the decision was wrong. She will get at least £600, but could get more pending a further hearing.

Mrs Hill, from Great Tey, said: 'It has been a horrible ordeal but I feel a step closer to justice.

'I was never doing it for the money, I was doing it because I believe what I did was right.

'I was getting blamed for doing something I truly believed was right.

'It the principle I was fighting for, it was never about the money, although I am happy about the outcome now.'

Mrs Hill now works as a cleaner around the village but misses dealing with children.

She said: 'I loved that job, I would definitely still be doing it if this has not happened.

'It is a real rollercoaster ride, one minute you're up and the next you're down.

'I am delighted with the outcome.'

Mrs Hill was initially suspended by Debbie Crabb, headteacher at the primary school in July 2009, and was fired in September after speaking to the press about her ordeal.

A statement from Great Tey Primary School, in Chrismund Way, said: 'The employment appeal tribunal upheld Mrs Hill's appeal into her compensation payout following dismissal from Great Tey Primary School.

'It does not change the outcome of the overall case but there may need to be a further liabilities hearing at an employment tribunal to reassess the amount originally awarded.'

Speaking after she first won her case for unfair dismissal in 2011, Mrs Hill told of her distress over the ordeal.

She said: 'I lost weight and my hair thinned because of the stress.

'The worst part was not being at the school any more. Not because of the money – but because of the job itself. I love kids and to be taken away from them like I was some sort of criminal was heartbreaking.

'I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t sleep, I lost weight, I snapped at people, I suffered high blood pressure, but now I feel vindicated and can hold my head up high again.

'I know I couldn’t have lived with myself having seen what I saw and keeping quiet. 

Another hurdle: Mrs Hill won her employment tribunal for wrongful dismissal in 2011 but had her compensation cut for speaking to the press about her ordeal

'It was important for me to fight for my job, even though I earned only £125 a month, because I thought I was right.

'What mother wouldn’t want to know that their child had been tied up and whipped with a skipping rope?’

Dave Prentis, general secretary of public sector Unison, said: 'Carol has been put through a terrible ordeal by the school and lost a job she truly loved.

'The value of someone being free to speak out against injustice must be upheld and this decision by the employment appeal tribunal strengthens and clarifies this important principle.'
