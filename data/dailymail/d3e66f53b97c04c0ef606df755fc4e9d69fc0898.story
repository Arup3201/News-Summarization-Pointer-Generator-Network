A slimmer who piled on the pounds yo-yo dieting after a schoolyard crush called her fat has shed nine stone after ditching food and living on a diet of juice.

Emma Tolliday, 37, began dieting at the age of just 13 when she received the cruel jibe.

Despite Emma trying every regime she could, nothing helped her lose weight permanently and she reached 21 stone at her heaviest.

Emma Tolliday became a lifelong yo-yo dieter at the age of just 13 when a schoolyard crush branded her fat - she has now lost nine stone on a juice diet

Struggling with anxiety and pre-diabetes, size 26 Emma booked a seven-day detox retreat with a friend to cleanse the fat and sugar from her system in July 2012.

Ditching her diet of pizzas and crisps, Emma, from Kent, lived on pure juice and dropped a stone in a week; the experience spurred her to adopt the diet permanently.

She spent the next nine months cutting out sugar, caffeine and dairy, sticking to two juices a day and managed to drop nine stone.

Emma, head of retail for cosmetic firm Models Own, said: 'Ever since I was a teenager I was always podgy.

'I started dieting at just 13 years old when I asked my mate to ask the boy I liked at school what he thought of me. He answered with one word - "fat."

'I was devastated and cried all night. The next day I went on a diet, and over the years I tried everything from slimming groups to shake replacements.

'Nothing worked for long and I eventually put the weight back on with more added on.

'I struggled with severe anxiety and during one of my GP visits the doctor told me my blood sugar was very high and diabetes was imminent. I was scared and desperate.

'The next day I was reading a magazine that talked about celebrities like Kim Kardashian using juice detoxes to lose weight.

'I thought that’s something I haven’t tried and decided to research more about it. I found a company called Obsidian that offered health retreats with juice detoxes.

'I got a mate of mine to join me for a week-long break in Spain. We thought if we made it more of a holiday it would motivate us. It was affordable so we signed up.'

During the retreat, which cost £500 all-inclusive for seven days, Emma stuck to three juices a day, exercise and relaxing by the pool.

'The only way I can describe it is like fat people rehab,' she said. 'I went into it thinking I would be starving. But after the first day I woke up feeling incredible.

'I had all this energy and felt better than I had in years. And the best bit was the juices were so filling I wasn’t hungry at all. When I lost a whole stone by the end of the week I knew that it actually worked.

'I got home and threw out all the junk food around the house and stocked my fridge full of fruit and veg. I bought a juicer and started juicing for meals.

'Eventually, a few weeks later, I started adding a healthy dinner like steamed chicken and vegetables into the mix but I kept to juicing all day. Within a year I had lost almost nine stone and fit into a size 12.'

Emma’s husband Ben, 30, was so inspired by her weight loss he decided to try the juice diet. The engineer managed to lose four-and-a-half stone alongside his wife.

At Emma’s next GP visit she was stunned to learn her body was in tip top shape; she no longer had to worry about diabetes and her anxiety had disappeared.

The newfound confidence triggered by her weight loss helped Emma land her dream job as a retail executive for a global cosmetic firm.

'Before I started juicing I never would have had the confidence to go for my job,' she said.

'The Obsidian retreat started a change that has improved my life immeasurably. I’ve even had friends start juicing because they are so impressed by the results.

'There’s a reason why so many celebrities pay big money for juice detoxes and diets. It’s because they work.'
