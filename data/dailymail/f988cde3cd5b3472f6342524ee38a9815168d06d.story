New role: Dan Stevens is to play a Guardian journalist in an upcoming film

The death of dashing Matthew Crawley broke the hearts of millions of Downton Abbey fans on Christmas Day.

But Dan Stevens, the actor who played him, already has  his next job lined up – playing a Guardian journalist in a new Hollywood film about WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.

He will appear alongside his friend Benedict Cumberbatch, of Sherlock fame, who has landed the lead role of the controversial whistleblower.

Stevens, who is currently on Broadway in the play The Heiress, told The Mail on Sunday in New York that ‘we’re in negotiations’ about the movie.

Assange had a turbulent relationship with The Guardian when they collaborated over the release of 250,000 secret US diplomatic cables last year.

Stevens’s character, who is called Ian, is based on Guardian deputy editor Ian Katz.

Steven Spielberg’s Dreamworks Studio, which is making the film, has struck a rights deal with The Guardian, although a spokesman insisted that neither Katz nor editor Alan Rusbridger had personally benefited from the arrangement.

Filming will take place next year – at the same time as the fourth series of Downton is shot, which may explain why Stevens had to quit the ITV period drama. He has previously said:  ‘There are some very exciting opportunities. Downton was a very monopolising job. I haven’t done as many films as I would have liked.’

Swedish beauty Alicia Vikander, 24, has also signed up for the film, which may be called The Man Who Sold The World.

It is not being made with the blessing of WikiLeaks.

But the studio has bought up the rights to two biographies of Assange – one by former WikiLeaks spokesman Daniel Domscheit-Berg and another by Guardian journalists David Leigh and Luke Harding.

All of the authors have fallen out with Assange, who is currently holed up in Ecuadorian Embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden to face sexual assault charges.

WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said: ‘If the film reflects what is written in those books, it will provide a negative view of WikiLeaks with limited impartiality. Hollywood is not exactly the best reflection of contemporary history.

‘I don’t believe WikiLeaks or Julian has been contacted by Dreamworks, but I don’t expect any courtesy from any organisation within Hollywood.’

Last year, at least five film versions of the WikiLeaks story were said to be in development.

In the Downton Christmas episode she played Edna, a flirtatious housemaid whose clumsy attempt to seduce a topless Tom Branson, the former chauffeur who has married into the Crawley family, led to her being dismissed from service. 

But such antics are tame compared with what MyAnna Buring gets up to in BBC1 crime drama Ripper Street, which begins tonight.

Set in 1889 in the aftermath of the Jack the Ripper murders, it stars the Swedish-born actress, 28 – who played a vampire in two of the Twilight films – as Long Susan, a feisty brothel-keeper who is on the run from the law in America.

Susan and her ex-lover Homer Jackson, a renegade former US Army surgeon (Adam Rothenberg), have  a tempestuous relationship  and are forever arguing.

The situation isn’t helped by the fact that Jackson,  a drunk and a gambler, is now sleeping with Rose,  a prostitute played by Charlene McKenna.

Viewers first see Buring’s character as she watches through a peephole as Jackson makes love to Rose. 

In another risque storyline, Jackson discovers Susan has hired out Rose to a man who may be a murderer.

Downton Abbey will thrive despite the controversial death of Matthew Crawley, the show’s writer Julian Fellowes has insisted.

Lord Fellowes said the character’s demise shortly after he had become a father would mean a pivotal role for his widow Lady Mary in the fourth series of the ITV drama next year.

‘Mary is back on her own, establishing her rights as the guardian of her baby son, fighting to get the estate through the dark days of the Twenties, struggling to re-find her own life,’ said Lord Fellowes.
