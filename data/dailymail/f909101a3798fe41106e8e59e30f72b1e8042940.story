Ever fancied having some of history's most famous world leaders over for tea?

Jug enthusiasts have shelled out a staggering £21,000 to do just that - snapping up an extremely rare collection of 'Toby' jugs depicting a range of dictators, politicians and military leaders at auction.

Among the rarest items that went under the hammer was a caricature of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, one of only three ever produced, that fetched a cool £8,280 - a record for a Royal Doulton character jug.

A collection of 30 rare 'Toby' jugs depicting world leaders past and present, including Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, left, and former US President John F Kennedy fetched £21,000 at auction

All 30 character jugs were made by the prestigious collectables manufacturer in limited edition runs.

An unnamed collector spent 20 years assembling the wares and proudly displayed them at his home in Plymouth, Devon.

But after having two young children, he became so nervous of the porcelain pieces being damaged he decided to sell them.

Other pieces that were listed included infamous Russian dictator Joseph Stalin, 'Desert Fox' Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, American World War II General Douglas MacArthur, ex-US president Ronald Regan and Mongol empire founder Genghis Khan.

China versions of former US President John F Kennedy, FD Roosevelt and Lord Kitchener were also up for sale.

Auctioneer Paul Keen, from the Plymouth Auction Rooms where the items sold, said: 'The owner has been a collector of Doulton character jugs for many years but he could no longer really enjoy them.

'He had to keep them locked behind a glass panel because he has two children and he was fearful they were a bit of a liability as far as the jugs were concerned.'

'Royal Doulton produced many of these jugs as limited editions and because of that some of them, like Fidel Castro, are scarce.

'I think the combination of their rarity and the subject matter helped generate the amount of interest we had.

'The Castro jug sold to an Australian buyer over the internet.

'The seller was in the room and had a beaming smile at the end of the sale because the overall price for the collection was well above the estimate.'
