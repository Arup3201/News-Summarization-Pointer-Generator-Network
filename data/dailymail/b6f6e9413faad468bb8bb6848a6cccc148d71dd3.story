Workers on the £15billion Crossrail project have made their latest breakthrough after tunnelling under the City of London with a 1,000 tonne drill.

The colossal machine, named Elizabeth after the Queen, has broke into the eastern end of Liverpool Street Crossrail station. 

The breakthrough - 40 metres below the financial district - symbolises light at the end of the tunnel for the project which is around 60 per cent complete.

Elizabeth now has 750m to bore to reach the end of the line as part of Crossrail's longest tunnelling drive of 8.3km from Limmo Peninsula, near Canning Town, to Farringdon and is expected to be finished in the spring.

Workers on the £15billion Crossrail project made their latest breakthrough by tunnelling under the City of London this morning

Andrew Wolstenholme, Crossrail's chief executive, said: 'We are now on the final countdown to the big east/west breakthrough at Farringdon, which will link all of Crossrail's tunnels for the first time.

'This is a phenomenal feat of civil engineering that London can be justifiably proud of. The next challenge is to implement railway systems across the route, keeping the project on time and within budget.'

Upon the breakthrough, a worker poked his head through the narrow gap and waved to colleagues in celebration.

So far more than 60 per cent of the overall work has been completed for the project which will see, by 2018, high-speed trains running from as far west as Reading in Berkshire, through central London to Abbey Wood in south London and as far east as Shenfield in Essex.

A sister machine, named Victoria, will reach Farringdon several weeks after Elizabeth.

Last week it was reported that Crossrail was facing major signal problems which could prevent any trains from being allowed to run when the line's due to open in 2018 - and engineers admitted the complex signal issues may not be resolved in the next three years.

A source inside the project claimed it was still likely that Crossrail would open, with reduced services, but suggested said it was also possible that no trains would be running at all in 2018.

More than 10,000 people are currently working on the project, including 400 apprentices, with the project at peak rate of construction.Tunnel machines Elizabeth and Victoria each weigh 1,000 tonnes, are 150 metres long and more than seven metres in diameter

The walls slowly begins to crumble as the gigantic drill bores through. Crossrail, Europe's biggest construction project, is initially scheduled to run 24 trains per hour during peak periods, and it is hoped this will increase to 30

Elizabeth and Victoria each weigh 1,000 tonnes, are 150m long and over seven metres in diameter. They are the last of eight Crossrail tunnel machines to have carved a route beneath London linking the West End, the City, Canary Wharf and southeast London

Crossrail adopts both traditional metro signalling and modern high-tech systems to connect trains on the 26 miles of new tracks underneath London to existing major cross-country rail lines.

As it stands, engineers are struggling to create 'interfaces' - meaning the trains are unable to shift smoothly from the orthodox Metro system to the state of the art sytsem used once outside central London.

Crossrail's chairman, Terry Morgan, conceded that a 'mitigation plan' was being put in place, The Independent reported. 

By the end of May this year rail services between Liverpool Street and Shenfield will join the TfL transport network. This will be the first phase of the introduction of Crossrail, which will be fully integrated with TfL services.

Joint Venture Dragados Sisk is constructing the eastern tunnels between Pudding Mill Lane and Stepney Green, Limmo Peninsula and Farringdon, and Victoria Dock Portal and Limmo.

The station tunnels at Liverpool Street have been built by a joint venture comprising Balfour Beatty, BeMo Tunnelling, Morgan Sindall and Vinci Construction. 

The Crossrail route will pass through 40 stations and run more than 100km from Reading and Heathrow in the west, through new twin-bore 21km (13-mile) tunnels below central London to Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east

On completion of the project, some 4.5 million tonnes of excavated material from the tunnels will be shipped to Wallasea Island in Essex where it will be used to create a new 1,500 acre RSPB nature reserve

£14.8bn: Total funding available to deliver the project isCrossrail construction began at Canary Wharf on May 15 2009. Tunnelling began in May 2012.

40km out of 42km: Length of Crossrail train tunnels are now constructed and the programme is more than 60% complete. 

10,000: Number of people currently working on the project, including 400 apprentices, with the project at peak rate of construction.

1,000 tonnes: The weight of tunnel machines Elizabeth and Victoria each. They are 150 metres long and more than seven metres in diameter.

They are the last of eight Crossrail tunnel machines to have carved a route beneath London linking the West End, the City, Canary Wharf and south-east London.

10 %: The percentage that Crossrail will boost the capital's rail capacity by, bringing an additional 1.5 million people within 45 minutes' commute of central London.

Liverpool Street is one of 10 new Crossrail stations being built in central and south-east London.

The first Crossrail services through central London will start in late 2018 - an estimated 200 million annual passengers will use the new scheme.

Some 4.5 million tonnes of excavated material from the tunnels will be shipped to Wallasea Island in Essex where it will be used to create a new 1,500 acre RSPB nature reserve.
