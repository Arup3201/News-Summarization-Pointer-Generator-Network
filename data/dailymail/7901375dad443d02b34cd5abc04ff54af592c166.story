A mother has finally given birth to a healthy son after losing six babies.

Harley McLean was born to Rachel Hales after she experienced the trauma of losing two premature babies and having four miscarriages.

But even his pregnancy did not run smoothly and Harley was born two months early and put on life support. He also contracted several infections.

Rachel Hales, 25, had Harley McLean, now eight-months-old, after losing two premature babies and suffering four miscarriages. Harley was born two months prematurely and spent three months in hospital

But, after three months at Tameside Hospital, in Ashton Under Lyne, Lancashire, Harley recovered and now, at eight-months, is thriving.

Ms Hales and her partner Andrew McLean, both 25 and from Ashton, have called their son a ‘little miracle’.

They also hailed his consultant ‘their guardian angel’.

Ms Hales, who already had a seven-year-old son, Leighton, had a difficult pregnancy leading to fears she could miscarry again at any time.

She was rushed into Tameside Hospital after collapsing on the bathroom floor and going into labour at just 28 weeks.

She said: ‘It was like something from a horror film. My little boy was crying and saying his brother and mum were going to die.’

Harley (pictured shortly after his birth) had to be delivered by C-section when Ms Hales went into labour and suffered a haemorrhage. He had to be placed on a life support machine

Ms Hales had haemorrhaged and baby Harley was delivered by emergency Caesarean section, before being admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit.

Ms Hales said: ‘Harley is our little miracle and my consultant Dr Beth Hammersley is our guardian angel.

‘I put all the faith I had in Beth because there was nothing else I could do.

‘I would walk over hot coals for her. I truly believe if it wasn’t for her and her actions that we wouldn’t be here now.’

Ms Hales’ pregnancy with her second son, Dylan, turned to tragedy when he was born at 26 weeks.

She had to make the heartbreaking decision, with her then partner, to turn off his life support after eight days.

Ms Hales, and her partner Andrew McLean, have described Harley as a 'miracle baby' and say that his consultant, Dr Beth Hammersley, at Tameside Hospital, is their 'guardian angel'

She then became pregnant with little girl, Kacey, who was born at 22 weeks but lived for just four hours.

She then went on to have four miscarriages.

When Ms Hales became pregnant again last year she felt ill immediately.

She suffered repeated problems and feared the worst when she went into labour early again.

She said: ‘I feel so lucky to have him - he’s our golden boy.

‘The care we have received from Tameside Hospital, all the medical team, the midwives and everyone in the unit has been amazing.’

Dr Hammersley added: ‘I met Rachel and Andrew for the first time in this pregnancy and we have been through something of a rollercoaster ride together.’
