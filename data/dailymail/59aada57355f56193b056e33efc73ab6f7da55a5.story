A Government minister has spoken out against the 'disgraceful' treatment of Nigella Lawson during the recent fraud trial of two of her assistants.

The celebrity chef has not been charged with any crime, but she was repeatedly accused of using illegal drugs in an attempt by lawyers for Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo to discredit her evidence.

Her brother Dominic has written of his anger at how she was treated on the stand, and now a leading Conservative MP has joined the chorus of criticism.

Defence minister Anna Soubry told the BBC: 'It is almost like a traditional feeding frenzy and I just find it utterly appalling and I think that everybody should just shut up and leave them to it.'

The trial, which concluded at Isleworth Crown Court last week with the acquittal of the Grillo sisters, has featured a string of lurid allegations about Ms Lawson's life with ex-husband Charles Saatchi.

The defence barristers argued that the chef allowed her aides to spend thousands of pounds on her credit card in an attempt to buy their silence about her drug abuse.

Ms Lawson admitted smoking cannabis and taking cocaine a handful of times, but denied being a regular or long-term user of illegal drugs.

'We are beginning to lose the plot in this country,' Ms Soubry said yesterday. 'It started with a photograph of her being assaulted by her husband.

'Out in public was played what should have been a very private and very distressing moment.

'These criminal proceeding had already begun in 2012, and now we have had this playing out of this court case where Nigella Lawson quite properly complains that she feels she is on trial.'

Ms Soubry is not the first politician to express support for Ms Lawson - the Grillos' trial nearly collapsed after David Cameron said he was on 'team Nigella', describing her as 'very funny and warm'.

The minister's feelings were echoed by Dominic Lawson, the brother of the TV star and a Daily Mail columnist.

He wrote today that his sister was wrongly portrayed as 'permanently drug-dazed' and 'addled by narcotics', and was not given an opportunity to defend herself against the allegations.

Mr Lawson, son of the former Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel, warned that the aggressive treatment meted out to his sister might dissuade others from coming forward as witnesses in future criminal trials.

Ms Lawson was first accused of drug-taking by her ex-husband Mr Saatchi in an email read out in court which he later disavowed.

The couple divorced earlier this year after the advertising mogul and art collector was pictured apparently throttling his wife during dinner at Scott's restaurant in Mayfair.
