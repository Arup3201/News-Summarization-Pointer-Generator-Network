With all the glitz and glamour of being an international football icon, you may have thought comes a wealth of beautiful women. But former Brazil superstar Ronaldo would have you believe otherwise.

Speaking with Sports Illustrated, the new part-owner of National American Soccer League side Fort Lauderdale Strikers reflected on a glittering career that saw him win two World Cups and three World Player of the Year awards.

Revealing that his best friend while playing was compatriot and former Real Madrid team-mate Roberto Carlos, the 38-year-old didn't hold back on all the nitty-gritty.

'My best teammate was Roberto Carlos. I slept more in the same room with Roberto Carlos in training camps than with all the women I’ve been with in my life!'

'I spent all my life with Roberto Carlos for 20 years: with the national team, with Real Madrid, with Corinthians,' he added.

Ronaldo, who was the World Cup's highest ever goalscorer until he was overtaken by Germany's Miroslav Klose in last summer's tournament, was also asked who he thought was today's most dangerous marksman.

Ronaldo scored a total of 62 goals in 98 appearances for his country, and won the World Cup twice

The 38-year-old said that Paris Saint Germain attacker Zlatan Ibrahimovic was the current best No 9 

'I think it’s Ibrahimovic. He wears No. 10, but he plays like a No. 9. 

'I’ve been last year a couple times to Paris to watch his matches. His movement! He’s very, very good, the best at the moment.' 

Dubbed 'The Phenomenon' in his playing days, Ronaldo never fell short of a plaudit or two - and was duly crowned the world's best player in 1996, 1997 and 2002 for his efforts - but it was without hesitation that he named the best player he'd ever played against. 

'Zinedine Zidane. I had the pleasure to train with him. People saw a lot of things in matches, but I saw him every day in training, in games. Every time it was amazing to watch him.'
