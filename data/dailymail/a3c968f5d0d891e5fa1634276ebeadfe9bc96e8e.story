Appearance: Fred Talbot, 63, is seen in public today for the first time since his arrest as he leaves his home in Bowden, Cheshire

TV weatherman Fred Talbot steps out in public today - for the first time since his arrest on suspicion of sexually abusing four schoolboys.

Wrapped up in warm winter clothing, the 63-year-old presenter was seen leaving his house after being arrested on suspicion of indecent assault and inciting a child to commit acts of gross indecency.

The allegations relate to former pupils at Altrincham Grammar School, Greater Manchester, between the early 1970s and early 1980s.

Talbot was a biology teacher at the school before he became a television weatherman in 1984,

Today the weatherman dressed in a woolly hat, puffa jacket and grey trousers made a bid not to be seen leaving his Â£500,000 semi detached cottage in Bowdon, Cheshire where he had been holed up since his arrest.

After checking the coast was clear out of the window, the former ITV's This Morning presenter tentatively peeked round his front door before emerging on foot for a walk.

Sources close to Talbot said he was 'devastated' by his arrest on Tuesday.

One friend said: 'This investigation has hit Fred very hard and he just wants to clear his name. He denies any wrong-doing and he simply cannot understand why this is happening to him.

'Fred's a very popular down to earth figure in the area is a regular at local pubs and he is mortified that people will talking about this investigation.'

The inquiry into Talbot was sparked after publicity about a separate investigation into allegations of historic sexual abuse of pupils at a nearby Catholic boys school.

The presenter who became famous for his 'floating map' reports in Liverpool's Albert Dock for Richard and Judy's This Morning show on ITV, was on a cruise in the Caribbean when his 18th century cottage was raided by police December 11 last year.

Officers broke in through the front door and searched the property for clues but spent a further four months investigating before arresting him. He has now been bail until August.

Detectives said they were appealing for more information to help with their investigation. They said the alleged offences did not take place within school grounds.

Talbot has not taken 'off air' at ITV's Granada Reports North West news programme although he was not formally suspended.

Today his agent Dave Warwick said: 'He has not been charged with anything so there is nothing to formally deny. There is nothing further to say.'

In a recent interview Talbot said he had been 'left in limbo' following the police raid.

Brought up in Altrincham, Talbot was a pupil at North Cestrian Grammar School and in 1964 was a founding member of the Altrincham and District Astronomical Society.

He co-discovered a meteor shower, the June Lyrids, in June 1966.

During one famous incident whilst presenting the weather on This Morning at Albert Dock in Liverpool, a streaker swam naked up to the map and jumped on.

In 1998, Talbot was named 'Weatherman of the year' at the Annual International Weather Festival in Paris and also acted as a weather forecaster on ITV Breakfast programme Daybreak.

In 2007 Talbot was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Science by Manchester Metropolitan University in recognition of bringing to a mass audience, 'a better understanding of scientific and environmental issues.'
