Hwang Kum-ja, a former 'comfort woman' forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese during World War II, died at age 90.

The total number of living South Korean victims of the practice during Japan's colonial rule of Korea is now 55.

Her death comes as the head of Japan's public broadcaster expressed regret on Monday for his comments on the use of military brothels in World War Two.

Momii gave a press conference over 
the weekend where he claimed military brothels occurred at the time in 
all countries at war. He acknowledged, however, that the practice was 
bad 'by today's morals'.

Political parties in South Korea, the country most indignant about the wartime practice, demanded Momii's resignation.

Momii,
 a former vice president at one of Japan's largest trading houses, 
claimed that his weekend comments on the 'comfort women' were his 
personal views and he shouldn't have mentioned them.

'Even
 as a personal opinion I shouldn't have said it. It was extremely 
inappropriate,' he said according to the Mainichi Shimbun daily. 'I had 
never been (speaking) in such a place before, it is my fault for not 
grasping the rules.'

It comes as Hwang's death prompted fresh scrutiny over Japan's failure to offer any compensation to 'comfort women'.

Hwang was born in 1924, forced into a glass factory at age 13 and later sent to China for sexual slavery at 16, according to Yonhap. After the war, she returned to Korea and lived alone for the rest of her life.

Japan's top government spokesman Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga defended Momii for his remarks that the use of women as military prostitutes was common worldwide during World War II

Hwang earned money by collecting garbage and receiving various government subsidies, Yonhap reported.

However, the news agency notes that she made three donations to a scholarship fund that totaled US$92,635. She received an award for her generosity in 2011.

Hwang's dying wish as that her remaining money be left to charity, it said.

An estimated 200,000 women, mainly Korean, were forced into sexual slavery during Japan's colonial rule, Yonhap said. Most surviving victims are over 80 years old.

Though Japan has apologized on several occasions for the comfort women and helped to establish to the Asian Women's Fund in 1995, it has so far not made direct payments to victims, CNN reported.

The channel adds that in 2013, the mayor of Osaka, Toru Hashimoto, caused controversy for saying use of comfort women was 'necessary' for soldiers who needed a 'rest.'

South Korea, Yonhap reports, has urged Japan to offer grievances to victims, since many are elderly and may die before they can receive compensation. Japan has claimed that compensations were resolved in a 1965 package.
