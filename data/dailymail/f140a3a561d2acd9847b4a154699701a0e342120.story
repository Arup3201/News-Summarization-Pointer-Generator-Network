Aston Villa have fended off interest from Bayern Munich and Liverpool to secure Easah Suliman.

The 16-year-old signed scholarship forms with Villa in the summer but has still been courted by bigger clubs as they looked to tempt the England Under 17 defender away from Villa Park. Bayern were particularly keen.

Suliman has captained England at Under 17 level and impressed Bayern's scouts playing in the FA Youth Cup.

Suliman, who is from Hall Green in Birmingham, has been with Villa since he was eight years old and was spotted playing in a tournament at Butlins.

However, despite overtures from Bayern, he will sign a two-and-a-half-year professional contract on Friday ahead of his 17th birthday next week.
