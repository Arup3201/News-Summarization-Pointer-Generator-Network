Few road vehicles could hope to outrun an aeroplane.

But thanks to a 12,000 horsepower engine and a top speed of almost 400mph, this rocket-propelled Chevy can do just that.

The vehicle known as the 'Flash Fire Chevy' is the brainchild of retired businessman Neal Darnell of Springfield, Missouri - who built it after he retired.

The Flash Fire Chevy built by retired American businessman Neal Darnell which is able to reach speeds of almost 400mph 

Together with his son Chris, Mr Darnell took a engine from a US Navy fighter jet and built the vehicle around it, meaning it can go from 0-60 in one and a half seconds 

The vehicle is so fast that Mr Darnell races it against aeroplanes and he can often outrun them thanks to the car's 12,000 horsepower engine 

Together with his son Chris, the pair took a Pratt and Whitney engine from a US Navy trainer jet called the T-2 Buckeye and built the vehicle around it.

With the additional rocket power, the Chevy is able to accelerate from 0-60 in 1.5 seconds - exerting up to G-Force 6 on the driver.

It can easily hit 350mph and has reached a top recorded speed of 375mph at airshows, where it impresses the crowds by catching up with light aeroplanes flying a few metres above.

Mr Darnell, 65, said: 'The truck is a Chevy S-10 replica. The body mould actually came from a real Chevy S-10.

'Basically to build one of these things you set the engine in the shop and then you build the truck around it.

'The frame is all chrome alloy steel and it was formed around the engine and made to fit the body. It's basically a two-year project and a lot of money.'

Mr Darnell races the car at airshows in the U.S. where he impresses the crowds by catching up and outrunning light aeroplanes flying above

The truck is a Chevy S-10 replica, which has been built around the two fighter jet engine with the frame made from chrome alloy steel 

Mr Darnell, who also races Shockwave, the World's Fastest Jet-Powered Truck, had worked in motor sports show production for 20 years before retiring - and then decided to put himself in the front seat.

He added: 'Prior to my airshow career we promoted monster-truck races, truck and tractor pulls and motocross events, that kind of thing, so it was kind of a natural progression.

'I have always raced something on the side. I have raced motorcycles, sand dragsters, funny cars and so when I retired I wanted to get into something that was fun and exciting.

He added: 'Everybody loves speed. I will always love speed. And this vehicle is definitely the ultimate speedster.'
