First came Santa hats, then it was Christmas jumpers.

Now, there’s a new festive novelty in town for pets…baubles.

The must-have fashion accessory of the season is wearable baubles, and so far they’ve been a hit with not only humans but pooches too.

Dog owners around the world are decking their pooches out in the must-have fashion accessory of the Christmas season - wearable baubles

Stella the dog, from New York, was photographed sporting dozens of limited edition Beard Baubles. The packet was auctioned off, with all proceeds of the in the sale going to charity to help the fight against skin cancer. Beard Baubles have now sold out due to popular demand

Beard Baubles, an idea by creative agency Grey London, is part of a drive to raise the profile of Beard Season – an initiative which encourages men to grow a beard for December to raise awareness of skin cancer.

While men around the world have been sporting the tiny festive ornaments in their facial hair - including one who wore his to the World Darts Championship in Alexandra Palace, north London, last night - dogs are also getting in on the action.

From the UK to America, pets have been dolled up with Christmas baubles before posing for a photograph.

Much like Movember, when men are encouraged to grow a moustache while raising money for prostate cancer, testicular cancer and mental health issues, Beard Season aims to raise awareness of melanoma.

Although the multi-coloured festive baubles are intended to be used on facial hair, people around the world have been snapping up the Yuletide accessory – which costs £5 for a pack of 14 – and attaching them to their beloved dogs.

Ollie Dearn, who works at Grey London, said: 'The product has been particularly popular with Brits.

'We've sold more than we ever expected.

'But Aussie, American, Kiwis, German and French customers have been purchasing Beard Baubles too.

'We've heard about hairy dogs wearing Beard Baubles too.’ 

Beard Baubles - the must-have accessory for bearded men - have been snapped up by dog owners too. Many dog lovers are recreating their own take on Beard Baubles, including this image of a bulldog decked out in festive attire with a clip-on fake beard and oversized baubles

One pooch, called Stella, was photographed covered in the baubles - which happened to be limited edition Beard Baubles, snapped up on eBay for hundreds of pounds.

The limited edition packet of the accessory, branded 'the only one in the world', was auctioned off online and won by a bidder in New York who used them to accessorise her dog. 

All profits of the sale went to charity to help raise awareness and treat skin cancer.

Pauline Ashford, one of the creatives at Grey London, said Beard Baubles had now sold out due to popular demand.

She said: 'The interest has been huge, it seems bearded men (and dogs) all over the world have been neglected at Christmas time up until now.

'We physically couldn't make enough Beard Baubles to satisfy the demand and post them all out in time for Christmas. But we'll be ready next year.

'Because there was still massive interest after we sold out of Original Beard Baubles, ​we decided that we would create some Limited Edition packs, to raise even more money for melanoma research, and to stretch the skin cancer awareness campaign longer over the festive period, especially in Australia where it is summer.

'The Limited Edition packs went up for auction on eBay and one of the winning bidders was the owner of a Labradoodle in NYC. 

'He put the Beard Baubles on his dog, called Stella, who was more than happy to pose for a photograph.

'We also got three artists involved to make their own hand-drawn versions and put them up for auction.'

The multi-coloured Beard Baubles, which attach gently to facial hair, are popping up on beards all over the world, including Callum Storey, 22, from Sevenoaks, Kent, who wore them at the William Hill World Darts Championship at Alexandra Palace in north London last night (above)

For every bag of baubles sold, the money will go to Beard Season - a charity which encourages men to grow a beard for December. Men (and dog owners) are urged to upload photos to Twitter using #BeardBaubles

Video from Beard Baubles:

Each pack of Beard Baubles contains 14 multi-coloured baubles, including 10 large balls and four small ones.

All proceeds from the baubles go to Beard Season, a non-profit Australian-based charity which works to raise awareness of melanoma.

The outfit has been running its December-themed initiative in Australia for the last two years, but has become more well-known in the UK since it teamed up with Grey London's Beard Baubles.
