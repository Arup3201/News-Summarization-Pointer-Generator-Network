Tragic: The body of Jennifer Huston, 38, pictured, has finally been discovered

Missing Oregon mother Jennifer Huston was found dead Tuesday morning near her SUV on a rural, remote road about 24 miles from her Dundee home, police said.

A landowner discovered her dark green Lexus on his property in Yamhill County near Sheridan around 10.30 a.m. and notified authorities.

Detectives who responded to the scene on Southeast Gopher Valley Road, just off Highway 18, discovered her body nearby, Newberg-Dundee Police Department Captain Chris Bolek told NBC News.

Bolek said there were no signs of foul play and no evidence to suggest that the public was in any danger, though he gave no indication of how she died.

The grim discovery comes a day after San Juan County, Washington, sheriff's office said it had been unable to confirm a report that the Dundee woman might be in the San Juan Islands of northwest Washington.

KPTV reports that the sheriff's office said Monday it had received 'no information confirming the presence of Jennifer Huston in the San Juan Islands.'

Investigators were checking out a report that the missing woman was spotted late last week on the ferry out of Anacortes to Friday Harbor in the San Juans.

A couple who notified deputies told KPTV that they saw a woman matching Huston's description driving a car that matched Huston's car on July 31.

The 38-year-old woman was last seen July 24 running errands at around 6pm. A search was conducted in Oregon.

Huston's family says she spent time in the San Juans in the past.

A couple say they saw a blonde female in her 30s on the 9am ferry to Friday Harbor in a car that matched the make and model of Huston's green Lexus, including a crack in the windshield.

Mr Huston has said that his wife complained of headaches three days before disappearing, but she hadn't seen a doctor. At a press conference on Monday, he said he feared she'd crashed her car

However the ferry system in the area is connected to 20 terminals, including Seattle, which made the search to find Huston on surveillance footage near impossible.

'If that was her on the ferry, she could be on Orcas Island right now, she could be on Lopez, she could be on Shaw, she could be anywhere using the ferry systems,' San Juan County Under sheriff Bruce Distler told KPTV last week.

Huston, from Dundee, Oregon, was last seen taking cash out at a bank, filling up her car with gas and then buying snacks and non-lethal sleeping pills at a Rite Aid in nearby Newberg around 6.22pm on July 24.

She also withdrew a 'small sum' of money from an ATM, but it is not known how much.

Her cell phone stopped working minutes after she was seen at the gas station, but police said it was not due to a dead battery, according to Fox News, and she has not used her credit cards since.

She told her husband, Kallen Huston, she had some errands to run, but then never returned home.

At a press conference this week, Mr Huston - who has passed a polygraph test - said he believed that finding his wife's 99 Lexus would be the key to finding her.

He also pleaded directly with his wife for her safe return.

Clue: If the new sighting of Jennifer Huston is confirmed, she was last seen 300 miles - or a six hour drive - from her Oregon home in Anacortes, Washington

'Jennifer, if you could see this or hear this, I love you,' Mr Huston said.

'You have a ton of support from the community. If you can come home, please do. The boys need you. I need you. I love you.

He added: 'We'll never stop looking for you.'

Local police called off their search on Friday with one final aerial search across rural roads in the area.

They also visited the San Juan Islands where the family used to visit but made no progress.

'After
 [Friday's] flight, the Yamhill County Sheriff's Office will have 
covered all rural areas of Yamhill County and no further search efforts 
are planned for Yamhill County,' a spokesperson for the sheriff's office
 said.

'If additional information arises, search efforts will be resumed as necessary.'

A clearly emotional Mr Huston, flanked by fellow members of her family, said he keeps calling his wife's cell phone even though it's been turned off on the hope someone might finally answer, KOIN reported.

stills of Mrs Huston's car at a gas station just minutes before she vanished last Thursday. Her cell phone stopped working shortly after

As to questions surrounding her final 
known purchases, a Gatorade, trail mix, and sleeping aids, her husband 
said they were not a cause for alarm - the sports drink was because it 
was a hot day, the trail mix was something they had in the house often, 
and the pills could be attributed to a headache she'd been suffering 
from for three days.

He went on to call the disappearance 'completely out of character for her. She loves me, She loves the boys.'

Captain
 Jeff Kosmicki of the Newberg-Dundee Police Department said her car, a 
1999 dark green Lexus LX 470 SUV, would be able to travel 300 to 350 
miles after she filled up the tank.

Mr
 Huston, who has passed a polygraph test, told investigators his wife 
had left to run errands and had been complaining of a headache for 
several days before she went out but said nothing else was out of the 
ordinary.

Mrs Huston was a stay-at-home mother 
to her two sons, aged two and six.

Her husband previously said he'd told
 them she was on vacation because he couldn't bear to tell them the 
truth.

He also expressed
 his fears that she might be 'in a ditch somewhere' after driving her 
car off the road and urged motorists to look out for his wife.

'I ask that anybody helping us, 
regardless of the area they are in, look off to the left and off to the 
side of the highways,' he said.

'This is totally unlike her. She's a 
devoted mother. Sheâ€™s just a very good person, and for her to do 
something like this is completely out of the norm.'

Mrs Huston's family had created a Facebook page to share photographs and information about her
