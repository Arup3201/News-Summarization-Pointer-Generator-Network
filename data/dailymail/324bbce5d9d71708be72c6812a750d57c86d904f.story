He was drunk, obsessed with murder and seething at life in the Royal Navy, but Able Seaman Ryan Donovan was still handed a loaded machine gun and allowed to guard a nuclear submarine.

Donovan then murdered a senior officer and attempted to kill three other shipmates in April this year.

Last night he was beginning a 25-year sentence for murder after a court heard how he had repeatedly promised to unleash a massacre.

The attack finally came after a row with two officers over poorly performed cleaning duties. Despite the row, he was allowed two days of shore leave – which ended at 3:30am on the fateful day when he was put to bed extremely drunk.

At noon that day – having told colleagues he was going to kill someone – he began a guard duty stint and was handed an automatic rifle. Moment afterwards weapons engineer Lieutenant Commander Ian Molyneux, 36, was shot in the head at point blank range.

The submariner – obsessed with gangster rap and violent computer games – admitted committing murder during a goodwill visit to Southampton by his submarine, the £1.2billion HMS Astute.

It emerged that the Navy missed a string of warnings about his behaviour.

They knew he had a police caution for assault, had been arrested for drunkenness and referred to doctors for alleged misuse of drugs.

One former submarine commander said: ‘That he could be given a firearm after a heavy drinking sessions is astonishing.

‘If this had happened at sea the Royal Navy could have had a catastrophe on its hands.’

Donovan fired seven shots in 13 seconds in
 the confines of the vessel before being wrestled to the ground by 
visiting dignitaries. Another officer was hit in the abdomen as others 
dived for cover.

Last night top brass were facing 
urgent questions about why he was given an SA80 automatic rifle and 30 
rounds of live ammunition and put on guard duty.

Because  life on submarines can be so cramped and claustrophobic the selection process for the ‘silent service’ is supposed to be more intensive than for other parts of the Armed Forces.

Submariners can be away from families for at least six months  at a time.

But, despite them having to pass an aptitude test, there is no formal psychological test.

Instead, senior officers believe the rigorous training which can last up to two years will weed out unsuitable recruits.

Before they begin training, personal qualities and life experiences are assessed.

Candidates must also pass a a medical and security checks.

Over the following weeks and months they will complete courses and exercises to judge whether they have physical and mental fortitude to operate in a confined environment for long periods and interact with a small crew.

The final section is the ‘Part 3’ training course where recruits put to sea in a sub.

Those who become submariners are supposed to continually assessed to make sure they remain fit for the job.

A year before the shooting Donovan had 
told fellow seaman Andrew Love that he was thinking about the best way to ‘start a
 massacre’ in the control room.

He said he wanted to stage a ‘kill 
frenzy’ from computer game Grand Theft Auto.

Prosecutor Nigel Lickley QC told Winchester Crown Court: ‘The defendant just giggled and said he was thinking how to start a massacre.

‘He started talking about Grand Theft Auto, where you start a massacre and rack up points by killing.

The prosecutor added: ‘Witnesses said Donovan had wild eyes and the look on his face was of somebody who was in another place – like they were in a dream and they were doing this like in a video game.’

Mr Justice Field yesterday branded the shootings a ‘murderous onslaught’. He said it was a miracle that Donovan  had not killed two other officers.

As Lr Cdr Molyneux’s widow Gillian sobbed in court, he said that the loss for her and their four young children will be ‘crushingly hard to bear’.

The judge added: ‘In killing that officer, you robbed him of a bright future within a loving family and with a promising career as a naval officer.’

The court heard that the seaman had faced up to a month in a naval prison after refusing to get up and help reclean a floor.

He was nevertheless granted two days’ shore leave during the five-day stop in Southampton as children and VIPs toured the submarine.

He spent the time drinking and visiting strip bars before volunteering for the first available guard duty on April 8.

On that day, as he travelled back to the submarine, he told fellow seaman Colin Banks: ‘I’m going to kill somebody’ adding, ‘I’m not kidding, watch the news.’

Donovan told another sailor before going on duty: ‘One day I will be famous.’ Asked why, he replied: ‘You will see.’

Despite being helped into bed while 
drunk at 3.30am, Donovan was handed the gun at noon after an officer 
sniffed his breath and checked his eyes to see if he was sober.

As
 he walked away Donovan suddenly swung around and began firing at Petty 
Officer Chris Brown, 36, and Chief Petty Officer David McCoy, 37, from 
less than 10ft. Four bullets missed the men.

Donovan then walked towards the control room where he was met by Lt Cdr Molyneux who shouted: ‘What have you done?’

He shot the officer in the head 
before stepping over his body and wounding Lieutenant Commander Chris 
Hodge, 45.

The gunman was then tackled by Southampton council leader 
Royston Smith and chief executive Alistair Neill.

Describing Lt Cdr Molyneaux’s 
actions, prosecutor Nigel Lickley QC said: ‘It was a totally heroic 
attempt to stop an armed man in his tracks.’ Mr Lickley added that Mr 
Smith and Mr Neill displayed ‘remarkable courage’.

The
 court heard details of how Donovan had been arrested in Canada in 2008 
for being drunk and had a police caution for assault in 2007.

In 2009 he was referred to a Navy doctor because of fears he may have been taking drugs but no evidence was found.

Donovan’s barrister Christopher Porter, QC, described his client as feckless and grossly immature and said he had intended to kill himself at the end of the shooting.

The widow of Lieutenant Commander Ian Molyneux said nothing could ever replace her ‘soulmate’.

Gillian Molyneux yesterday sobbed and prayed in court as her husband’s brave last moments were relived through the words of witnesses.

Weapons engineer Lt Cdr Molyneux, 36, did not work with Ryan Donovan and the killer had no argument with him, but mercilessly gunned him down anyway.

Mrs Molyneux said outside Winchester Crown Court: ‘Nothing can ever replace Ian – my husband and soulmate and the father of our four beautiful children.

‘There is no pleasure or relief for me today – only the ongoing, heartbreaking sadness for the loss of Ian.

‘I find huge comfort in the abundance of love and support I have received from my family, many friends, Ian’s colleagues in the Royal Navy.

‘I will now try to rebuild my life with my gorgeous children and the eternal memory of Ian, my hero and true love.’

Addressing the children directly, she added: ‘To Jamie, Arron, Bethany and Charlie – your Daddy and I love you very much and our future will always be guided by him.’

Colleagues of Lt Cdr Molyneux described him as a devoted family man who was proud to serve in the Royal Navy.

Known to comrades as Molly, he lived with his wife and children, aged between three and 13, in Standish, Wigan.

HMS Astute’s commanding officer commander Iain Breckenridge described the dead man as a ‘gentle giant’ with a ‘mischievous twinkle in his eyes’.

He said: ‘I know that every man in Astute considered Molly as a true shipmate and held him in the highest regard.’
