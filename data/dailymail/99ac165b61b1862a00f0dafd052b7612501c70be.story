In a stunning clash of two branches of the U.S. federal government, a Texas congressman told Attorney General Eric Holder on Tuesday that he should be 'in jail' instead of answering questions in a Capitol Hill hearing.

Republican Rep. Blake Farenthold refused to ask Holder – the hearing's sole witness – any questions, instead slamming him for defying congressional document subpoenas and ignoring a criminal contempt citation the House of Representatives lodged against him nearly two years ago.

'I'm committed to maintaining the constitutional balance of power and the authority that this legislative branch has,' Farenthold said, 'and I just don’t think it’s appropriate that Mr. Holder be here.'

'If an American citizen had not complied with one of the Justice Department’s subpoenas, they would be in jail and not sitting here in front of me testifying.'

Texas Republican Rep. Blake Farenthold refused to ask Holder any questions, suggesting that the Attorney General should be 'in jail' for contempt of Congress

Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was killed in 2010 with a gun that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and explosives -- a DOJ agency -- sent across the Mexican border in a flawed scheme to track drug kingpins

His point made, Farenthold gave the balance of his allotted five minutes to South Carolina GOp Rep. Trey Gowdy.

The House voted in 2012 to hold Holder in civil and criminal contempt following the Justice Department's longstanding refusal to turn over documents related to Operation Fast and Furious.

That program was a scandal-plagued gun-running exercise that put illicit weapons in the hands of hundreds of Mexican nationals tied to drug cartels, beginning in 2009. The government has said it intended to track the guns, but it couldnt recover more than 1,300 of them.

Brian Terry, a U.S. Border Patrol agent, was killed in December 2010 with one of those weapons. Other Fast and Furious guns have been tied to the deaths of about 200 Mexican citizens.

Earlier in Tuesday's House Judiciary Committee hearing, Holder snapped at another Texas congressman, Louie Gohmert, who upbraided him over his failure to produce everything Congress had subpoenaed.

'Sir, I've read you what your 
department promised, and it is inadequate,' Gohmert lectured. 'And I 
realize that contempt is not a big deal to our attorney general, but it 
is important that we have proper oversight.'

'You don’t want to go there, buddy,' Holder warned the congressman. 'You don’t want to go there, okay?'

Hours earlier Texas GOP Rep. Louis Gohmert slammed Holder, saying a congressional vote of contempt is apparently 'not a big deal to our attorney general'

When Gohmert brought up the 2012 congressional criminal contempt citation against Holder, the attorney general snapped: 'You don't want to go there, buddy!'

Most of the guns trafficked into Mexico in the flawed 'Fast and Furious' program wound up in the hands of drug lords and their henchmen, and some were used to commit murders -- on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border

Gohmert, a former Texas district court judge, fired back.

'Sir, we’ve been trying to get to the bottom of Fast and Furious where people died, where at least a couple hundred Mexicans died,' he said.

'And we can’t get the information to get to the bottom of that, so I don’t need lectures from you about contempt, because it is very difficult to deal with asking questions.'

'And I don’t need lectures from you either,' Holder sniped.

Holder spent more than two hours defending his record as attorney general amid a sustained grilling from Republicans.

'I'll put my record up against any other attorney general,' he insisted.

'Any hint that we have engaged in anything partisan in nature … I one-thousand-percent reject.'
