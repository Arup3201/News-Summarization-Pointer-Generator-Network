With pained expressions on their faces, these brave runners take on the world's toughest foot race.

In searing 130F heat, they run 135 miles through three mountain ranges in some of the harshest terrain on the planet.

The Badwater Ultramarathon started yesterday, with competitors racing from Death Valley to Mount Whitney in California.

Hard: Competitors run in the Badwater Ultramarathon in Death Valley National Park, California, which is billed as the world's toughest foot race

Exhausting: The terrain makes the race extremely difficult for the runners, with miles of road visible ahead of the competitors

Red hot: With long, flat, open roads, there is nowhere for these runners to escape from the scorching conditions

Hot: Oswaldo Lopez, 41, from Mexico is doused with water as he races from Death Valley to Mount Whitney, California

Runners battle through the sweltering conditions, on long roads which stretch out for miles ahead.

Competitors often pass signs which read 'Caution! Extreme heat danger'.

Many runners, who travel to the event from all over the world, try to lighten the strain by dressing in fancy dress.

The Badwater Ultramarathon is not for the faint-hearted.

Competitors train all year around for the event, knowing that they will running in some of the planet's toughest conditions.

To deal with the searing 55C heat, racers often prepare by sitting in saunas for up to an hour.

This helps acclimatise the body to the extreme desert heat which they will experience during the race.

With no shade along the route, runners cover themselves with long sleeved shirts and sun hats.

However, one of the most important thing for racers to protect themselves against is dehydration.

Every few miles, racers take on water from the support teams. They often weigh themselves throughout the race to judge how much water they have lost while racing.

One man was pictured at the event yesterday dressed in a tutu while another could be seen in a funny hat and shorts.

However, the clothing worn by the 
runners show just how careful they have to be, with sun stroke and dehydration a very real possibility.

Runners wear caps to protect themselves 
from the blazing sun, while others cover up in trousers.

Others have teams with them, providing much-needed water and encouragement.

One thing which cannot be in any 
doubt is the bravery of the runners.

This is highlighted by Britain's 
Chris Moon, 51, who despite wearing a prosthetic leg took part in the 
race.

He lost his right arm and leg in a 
devastating explosion while supervising mine clearance in Mozambique in 
1995.

He has completed the race before, becoming the first amputee ever
to attempt the race.

Speaking last year, Mr Moon, who was born in Wiltshire, but lives in Strathaven in Lanarkshire, said: ‘I want to challenge the concept of limitation.

'I want to overcome physical challenges and show that I have not been weakened by the unfortunate things that sometimes happen.

'I run further now than I ever did before I was blown up.

‘I have worked very hard and I want to keep going until I am in my 70s.

‘I am driven by all sorts of things.

'What is life without aspirations?’

Tired: Shannon Farar-Griefer, 52, of Hidden Hills, California lies down as her team help to rehydrate her

Covering up: Throughout the race, the competitors have to wear a number of different outfits to protect them from the conditions and seating heat. This picture shows Britain's Mr Moon with a protective cap on

Tough: Glen Redpath of Canada, 47, ploughs on despite the often searing 55C heat

Dangerous: Despite the warning signs, these racers continue running through the extreme heat

Many competitors wear head lamps to help with visibility as the sun sets .

The race takes place in July of every year.

Up to 100 athletes including runners, triathletes, adventure racers, and mountaineers take part.

Scenic: Despite the tough conditions, the runners can take in some breathtaking scenery along the route

Lethal: Runners need to wear caps to protect themselves from the heat, with sun stroke and dehydration a very real possibility

Global appeal: Competitors enter the race from all over the world. This is Ben Gaetos, 56, from the Philippines

Determined: Shannon Farar-Griefer, 52, of Hidden Hills, California, begins to race again after stopping to drink water

This years was the 36th event, with 
organisers saying it is the 'most demanding and extreme running race 
offered anywhere on the planet'.

The start line is at Badwater, Death 
Valley, which is 85m below sea level - the lowest elevation in the 
Western Hemisphere. The race ends at the Mount Whitney Portals at nearly
2530m.

The course covers three mountain ranges, covering a 3962m vertical ascent.
