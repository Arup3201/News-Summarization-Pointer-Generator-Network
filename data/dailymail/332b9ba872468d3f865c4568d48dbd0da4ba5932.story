A burglar is back behind bars just six months after he vowed to end his 30-year life of crime.

Martin Gilbert, 48, blamed drugs and alcohol for his past when he made a public apology last June to a victim whose house he had raided twice.

But his promises came to nothing. Just before Christmas he stole jewellery and valuables from five houses and a church in his home city of Newcastle - and some victims were in their 80s.

Gilbert said he was 'totally ashamed' as he pleaded guilty this week to six counts of burglary at Newcastle Crown Court, where he was told a jail term is inevitable.

He admitted breaking into a home and two sheltered flats on November 29 before raiding the Presbyterian St Anthony's Church on December 2 and two more homes on December 11. 

Kevin Wardlaw, prosecuting, said: 'Some of the complainants in these cases are elderly, some in their 80s.'

Jamie Adams, defending, told the judge Gilbert wished to be sentenced as soon as possible.

'He is a certified burglar,' he said. 'He knows what to expect.'

Recorder Andrew Dallas told Gilbert, who appeared via a video link from prison, he would be sentenced in three weeks and warned more time behind bars inevitable.

'This is someone who has re-offended in six months,' the judge said. 'It's just a question of fixing the length of the sentence.'

As he did so the burglar repeatedly said: 'I'm very sorry and I'm totally ashamed of what I have done. I'm very sorry.'

Evidence: CCTV had previously caught Gilbert, whose criminal career has lasted 30 years, in the act

Gilbert stole jewellery and cash worth almost £30,000 and covered his hands with socks from a clothes line

Gilbert, from Walker, Newcastle, vowed to turn his back on crime in June after meeting one of his victims and seeing how much misery he had caused, posing with her for pictures in the press.

He had fed a drugs habit by stealing cash and valuables from the homes of others during a crime career spanning 30 years.

Gilbert, whose son was murdered in 2008, was jailed for three and a half years in 2011 for a burglary spree during which he raided 18 homes, stealing cash and jewellery worth almost £30,000.

Most of the thefts were from elderly people's bungalows and during broad daylight.

He was eventually caught on CCTV using residents' own tools to smash his way into their homes. At one he even took socks off the washing line to cover his hands. 

He was released from prison on licence in July 2013 after serving 21 months.

As part of his rehabilitation he was offered the chance to take part in a 'restorative justice' programme, which gives criminals the opportunity to meet their victims and see the impact their crimes have had.

Reconciliation: Christine Bell (right), from whom Gilbert stole previously, said she was disappointed

So in June last year Gilbert, who has two daughters and is a grandfather, was introduced to Christine Bell, whose home he burgled twice.

Mrs Bell, who works as a court usher, had told him how his raid left her feeling nervous entering her own home. Today she said she was disappointed.

'If I'm ever tempted again I will think of her,' Gilbert said last year. 'I just want to say sorry to everyone I have burgled.

'At the time I didn't think about the victims at all, I was so off my head on drugs and alcohol. I was in a bad state and was just doing it for money to feed my habit.

'I just needed money. But I've realised now and I'm just really really sorry for all the pain and hurt I have caused.

'I have been in and out of prison most of my life, but this time I just thought; "I don't want to end up back here. I need to change my ways."'

Gilbert will be sentenced later this month.
