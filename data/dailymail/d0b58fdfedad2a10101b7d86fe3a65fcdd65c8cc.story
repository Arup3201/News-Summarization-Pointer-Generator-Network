Sir David King, the former Chief Scientific Advisor to the Government, has issued a warning about the future of fracking

Britain would have to drill up to 2,000 shale wells a year to achieve a substantial drop in energy costs, according to experts.

Sir David King, the government's former chief scientist, suggested cost benefits from fracking may only be achieved with major disruption to the landscape.

He expressed support for firms drilling to explore the size of the UK's reserves which could reduce reliance on imported gas from Russia and Qatar.

But he warned those expecting gas 
prices to plummet as in the United States, that the far higher 
concentration of people and resulting planning issues in Britain would 
make it very difficult to do it 'on anything like the same scale' and 
raise problems with 'social acceptance.'

David
 Cameron has embraced fracking - horizontal drilling to extract natural 
gas from shale rocks thousands of feet underground.

The
 prime minister said last year: 'I think we would be making a big 
mistake as a nation if we did not think hard about how to encourage 
fracking and cheaper prices right here in the UK.

'If
 you look at what's happening in America with the advent of shale gas 
and fracking, their energy costs in business and their gas prices are 
half the level of ours'

But
 Sir David, who is William Hague's special representative on climate 
change, said: 'If we were looking at an expectancy of a thousand or two 
thousand wells a year - which would have an impact on our economics - it
 would be very difficult to foresee how that could happen in Britain.'

He added: 'I'm all for exploring shale gas in the UK, I think there is a potential there.

'I see it as a relatively medium term 
potential, I don't think it's going to continue well into the future - 
but I think there is an economic advantage from being able to produce a 
primary energy source within the British Isles, obviating the need to 
import.

'But I would 
caution the extent to which this can have a dent on our economics, 
simply because I don't think that we can frack on anything like the 
scale that is taking place in the United States.'

He
 told a House of Lords committee that in the US, where up to 30,000 
wells are drilled per year 'there has been quite an outcry among the 
population' in built-up areas. In Balcombe in Sussex, drilling by the 
firm Cuadrilla was ground to a halt by protestors last year.

German-owned energy giant Npower has snubbed a Government call to give a £50 price cut to all customers.

Five
 weeks ago, the Chancellor announced a change in Green and Eco levies 
that were designed to cut the bills of all families struggling to pay 
for heat and light by £50.

However,
 Npower, which is Britain's most expensive energy firm, said 
yesterday(thrs) that some 500,000 customers on fixed rate deals will 
only get a reduction of £12.

At
 the same time, 54,000 households who only get their gas for central 
heating and hot water from Npower will not get any reduction at all.

The
 full £50 reduction is being reserved for dual fuel customers on a 
variable tariff who suffered an average price rise of 10.4per cent in 
December.

The two biggest 
suppliers, British Gas and SSE, are giving a £50 cut to all customers, 
however, EDF, Eon, Scottish Power and now Npower, say they will not.

Each well requires tons of sand and water delivered in lorries used to crack open the rocks, he said, which causes damage to roads and problems with 'social acceptance'.

And the gas produced from each well drops by around 70pc after the first year, he said. 'If you want to keep up production you need to keep up fracking.'

Professor David MacKay, Chief Scientific Officer at the Department of Energy and Climate Change, told peers that the UK's shale gas reserves are estimated to be around a third of the size of those in the North Sea.

But he said how much could be extracted, and the impact on energy prices, would remain 'extremely uncertain' until the first 20 to 40 wells are drilled in the coming years.

The UK will remain heavily dependent on gas, which currently produces around a third of our energy, 'for many decades' for industry and heating systems'.

Hence, he said: 'We must have an energy policy that adds up...it seems a reasonable thing to do to try and source our gas domestically. The alternative will be an increasing dependence on other countries such as Qatar and Norway and Russia for gas.'

Both experts played down concerns that fracking could lead to water contamination or earthquakes saying UK regulations were strong enough to guard against it.

Green groups are against fracking, saying it will make it difficult to meet the legally binding target to cut carbon emissions by 80pc by 2050 - and urge investment in wind and solar farms instead.

But the government's independent climate advisor, former Tory minister Lord Deben, said campaigners with a 'theological objection' to fracking are 'just factually wrong'. He told MPs at another energy committee yesterday that gas has a valuable part to play in the economy.
