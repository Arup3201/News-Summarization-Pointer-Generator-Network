Dead: Police are investigating the mysterious death of Jay Harper, pictured, whose body was discovered on Deerfield Beach on Wednesday morning

Police are investigating the mysterious death of a Connecticut executive whose body was found washed up on a Florida beach on Wednesday.

Jay Harper, 47, of Southbury, disappeared on Tuesday night, during a corporate conference at the Embassy Suites hotel in Deerfield Beach.

The father-of-three's body was discovered at around 4am on Wednesday on the stretch of beach directly in front of the hotel, but police have not revealed whether they suspect foul play.

Colleagues at Coverall Health-based Cleaning System, where Mr Harper was a regional vice-president, are shocked at the man's tragic death.

Mark Searcy, who worked with Mr Harper at the cleaning company, which is head-quartered in Deerfield Beach, dubbed it an 'apparent accident'.

'Please pray for family of Jay 
Harper, a colleague who died tragically in Dearfield Beach (sic) FL 
early this morning in an apparent accident while attending a company 
planning meeting,' he wrote on Facebook.

Mr Seary added that his boss had had a 'good day' at the work event on Tuesday and enjoyed a team dinner the night he went missing.

'We all had dinner together last night,' he wrote. 'Woke up to the news that he was found washed up on the beach. He was 47. Left behind a wife and 3 children. He had a good day yesterday before tragedy.

'No one is guaranteed tomorrow, hug your loved ones a little closer tonight. Tell them that you love them daily.'

Another colleague, Richard Levinson, commented: 'Well said mark. RIP. Jay a good man a good boss. You will be missed.'

According to Broward County Sheriff's Office, Mr Harper's body washed ashore in the oceanside community and was found about 4am on Wednesday by a deputy patrolling the beach on an ATV.

The body was found just south of the city's International Fishing Pier and was taken to the Broward County Medical Examiner's office for an autopsy. Its findings have not yet been released.

The sheriff's office has confirmed Mr Harper's identity but has not shed any light on the mysterious circumstances surrounding his death.
