The key to any good flashmob is the element of surprise, but for these tricksters the surprise was on them when police turned up and began arresting everyone.

Prank group Improv Everywhere ran into trouble while pretending to be shop mannequins in a Manhattan branch of Gap after an employee called police.

Around 40 people went into the shop dressed in Gap clothing with white bodysuits underneath, before zipping the suits up at a predetermined time and posing next to genuine mannequins.

Members of a flashmob posing as shop mannequins in a Gap store in Manhattan were handcuffed by police after a member of staff called the authorities

The stunt involved around 40 people who were all asked to go to the store wearing gap clothes and bodysuits

The participants all went into the store separately before zipping the suits up at a predetermined time

While members of the public and some Gap staff were filmed finding the stunt amusing, it wasn't long before one shop assistant called 911.

Concerned by a spate of burglaries disguised as flashmobs at other nearby stores, officers promptly cuffed around 20 of the human mannequins before laying them out on the floor.

'We were very surprised at the response,' Improv Everywhere founder Charlie Todd told Mashable. 'It was distressing to see these people who were just helping me out down on the floor in handcuffs.'

However, when cops realised people were just part of an innocent stunt, they decided to let them go.

The store manager said he considered banning the participants for life, but had decided against it.

They then posed next to genuine mannequins dotted around the store (the fake mannequin is on the right)

Initially members of the public and staff were filmed laughing at the trick (fake mannequin is on the far right)

At a glance the intruders are almost indistinguishable from the real thing (fakes are left, in glasses, and right)

By strange coincidence, it turned out that one policeman recognised some of the group's organisers, because he had taken part in one of their flashmobs last summer.

On that occasion 7,000 people dressed up like tourists and went to New York's South Street Seaport as part of an MP3 experiment.

They were asked to download a track on to their MP3 player, then press play at a predetermined time and follow the instructions they were given.

Improv Everywhere has carried out roughly 20 pranks in stores including Staples, Macy's and Starbucks, all of which passed off without much of a fuss.

While some people remained oblivious to what was going on, it wasn't long before one staff member called police

By coincidence it turned out that there had been a spate of robberies nearby disguised as flashmobs, so when cops arrived they placed around 20 of the mannequins in handcuffs and laid them on the floor

However, after establishing it was just a harmless prank, officers let the participants go. By coincidence, it turned out that one policeman had actually taken part in another of the group's flashmobs last summer

The last time police were called in was during a prank at Best Buy eight years ago when participants dressed up like employees and stood around the store helping members of the public out.

While nobody was handcuffed on that occasion, they were all forced to leave the store after staff became concerned.
