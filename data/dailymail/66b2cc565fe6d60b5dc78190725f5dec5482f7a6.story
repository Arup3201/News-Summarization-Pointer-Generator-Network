A maths teacher accused of sex offences involving a schoolgirl was allegedly caught by her mother who found him under the bed.

Andrew Welsh, 35, was arrested after he was discovered at the schoolgirl's home.

Welsh appeared today before magistrates in Bolton charged with six counts of sexual activity with a girl aged 13 to 17 and abuse of a position of trust.

He was reportedly caught hiding under the girl's bed by her mother

The offences are said to have taken place between May and July last year.

The court heard legal arguments about whether the girl was still registered as a pupil at the school when some of the offences allegedly took place.

Peter Hayes, defending, told the court that the 'majority' of the alleged sexual activity took place after the girl was no longer enrolled at the school.

Therefore, he claimed, any sexual activities that happened after the 28 June were 'not criminal offences'.

Welsh, who has a partner, did not enter any pleas and the case was adjourned until January 29 when he will appear before magistrates again.

He was granted bail on condition that he lives at his home address, surrenders his passport, attends a police station twice a week and has no unsupervised contact with a child under 16.

Police said they were called an address in the Bolton area on July 19 following concerns for the welfare of a 16-year-old girl after a man was discovered in her bedroom.

It is understood the man was allegedly spotted hiding under the girl's bed by her mother who became suspicious after returning home and finding her daughter not in school.

Police were contacted and Welsh was arrested later the same day.

Welsh, of Atherton, Greater Manchester, has been suspended by his school, which cannot be named for legal reasons.
