A syringe-wielding robber who was chased off by a shopkeeper holding a bottle of toilet duck bleach has been jailed for three years.

Nicholas Smith, 34, stormed into Poole Convenience Store, in Dorset, and demanded money from the till.

He threatened shop assistant Kili Moorthy, 24, with a syringe he said was infected with Aids.

A court heard that he held up the needle and said to Mr Moorthy: 'I've got Aids, do you want it?' during the early morning attack.

Smith forced Mr Moorthy behind the counter but the quick-thinking worker grabbed a bottle of Duck toilet cleaner from a shelf and pointed it at him.

He chased Smith outside after scaring him with the domestic liquid and picked up an advertising board to shield himself from the offender.

Attack: He can be seen approaching shopkeeper Kili Moorthy brandishing a needle

Weapon: Mr Moorthy used Toilet Duck to defend himself from the would-be robber

Smith fled the scene but was traced by DNA found on the needle.

He pleaded guilty to attempted robbery and was sentenced at Bournemouth Crown Court.

Anita Gibson-Lee, prosecuting, said Mr Moorthy had been alone in the shop and sorting out the newspapers, when balaclava-clad Smith entered and demanded the takings.

She said: 'Mr Smith had a syringe in his hand and pointed it towards his victim, saying, 'I've got Aids, do you want it?'

'He was very scared because he thought he was going to be attacked by the needle.'

During interview Mr Moorthy said: 'I've never experienced anything like this before, I don't want to go back to the shop.'

Smith said he couldn't remember where he had been on the day of the incident, which happened at 7am on October 29 last year.

The court heard that he had been 'absolutely mortified' by the offence and had 'lost three days' after taking a cocktail of prescription drugs, heroin and alcohol.

The father-of-one from Weymouth begged Judge John Harrow to allow him to continue receiving help for his habit.

He said: 'I've had this awful affliction for 14 years, this recent brush with the law is the catalyst for change.

'Although the punishment for the crime is custodial, I don't think it is the answer.'

Judge Harrow sentenced Smith to three years in prison.

He said he was convinced the robbery would have been carried out if it hadn't been for the 'courageous response' of Mr Moorthy.

He added: 'Shopkeepers are vulnerable, that is why people like you pick on them.'

Speaking after the ordeal, Moorthy said: 'There was no money in the till, it was empty.

'It's not my job, I was just there to cover for my cousin, so I won't be going back there for a while.'
