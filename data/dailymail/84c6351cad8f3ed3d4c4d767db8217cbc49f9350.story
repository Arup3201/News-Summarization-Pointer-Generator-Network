The Air Force is using a secret network of informants to crack down on drug-taking and sexual offences, claims one former cadet who says he was recruited to spy on colleagues before being unfairly expelled when an operation went wrong.

Eric Thomas, 24, says that during his time as a snitch at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, he provided information which resulted in 15 drug convictions and two sexual assault convictions.

But he says his handlers hung him out to dry after he got into a fight with a cadet he had been tasked with tailing and was expelled just a few months before his graduation.

Spies in their midst: The Air Force has a secret network of informants 
among cadets at their California Springs Academy to crack down on drug 
use and sexual assaults

Thomas claims he was recruited by the Air Force's Office of Special investigations (OSI), which uses FBI-style tactics to operate dozens of informants among the academy's 4,400 cadets.

He told the Colorado Springs Gazette: 'It was like a spy movie. I worked on dozens of cases, did a lot of good, and when it all hit the fan, they didn’t know me anymore.'

The newspaper conducted a lengthy investigation and has produced an in-depth report about the alleged use of informants at the base.

They tracked down four cadets, claiming to have been informants, of which three agreed to speak. All of them said they had been told by the OSI that they were the only informant on campus.

The Air Force academy is notorious for its strict system of rules and discipline which aims to strip incoming cadets of any sense of individuality and replace it with a collective Air Force identity.

In the first months they are required to quick march around base and sit at attention during meals setting their forks down while they chew each mouthful a regulation seven times.

Although strictly forbidden, parties do take place, often at houses rented specifically for the purpose by third parties.

Drinking is said to be common place as is the smoking of marijuana and a synthetic marijuana known as Spice.

Thomas claims he was instructed to infiltrate these parties and report to his handlers about who was supplying and taking the drugs.

He said in one incident he was called to a meeting by a handler known as 'Briana', actually a burly man with a beard and glasses named Special Agent Brandon Enos.

He claims Enos produced a pack of cheap cigars and taught him how to roll a blunt - a marijuana joint which uses the skin of a cigar - and how to appear to smoke it without actually inhaling.

Thomas, who said he came from a strict home and had never used drugs before recalled: 'The whole time I was like, "OK, I’m getting told how to roll a blunt by a federal agent; this is a different cadet experience that is not in the brochure"'.

In one oeration, the OSI told Thomas they wanted him to get close to a cadet naed Stephan Claxton, who had been reported sexually assaulted four female cadets but who couldn't be prosecuted because the cadets had reported him confidentially.

Thomas went out drinking with Claxton and other cadets including a civilian woman who was engaged to a cadet at the academy.

Although Thomas had not been given permission to leave the base that weekend, the OSI told him to break the rules.

The subsequent court martial heard how the woman ended up getting drunk and passing out and the cadets took her back to the academy to find her fiancé.

Claxton and Thomas took her to any empty dorm room where Claxton remained with her while others went to find her fiance.

Thomas later discovered Claxton inisde the room with her shirt up and pants undone at which point a fight between him and Claxton and Thomas broke out.

Claxton was charged with sexual misconduct and sentenced to six months behind bars. Thomas and five other cadets were punished for sneaking off base and having a female in the dorm.

Thomas thought he would be protected by the OSI but he was stripped of his rank and restricted to base.

Despite this the OSI continued to direct him to follow targets and buy drugs even if it meant breaking the rules and leaving the base.

After the academy found out he was leaving despite his restrictions, commanders were outraged at his contempt for the rules.

Just six weeks before he was due to graduate, having been accepted into pilot school, he was expelled.

He has now moved back with his family in South Dakota and has launched an appeal for wrongful dismissal for which he is waiting for a response.
