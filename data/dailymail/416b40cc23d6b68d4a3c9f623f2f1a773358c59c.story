The body of a woman who vanished nine weeks ago without shoes, money or her phone has been found in a Utah river five miles from her home.

Kayelyn Louder, 30, had not been seen since September 27, when she was captured on surveillance camera leaving her Murray condo barefoot in the heavy rain.

On Monday, workers inspecting drainage pipes in the Jordan River in West Valley City found her decomposed body partially submerged. She was identified by dental records on Tuesday.

Her cause of death is still undetermined and authorities are not sure how she ended up in the river, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. A creek that leads to the river runs behind Louder's home but investigators believe the it was too shallow to carry her body five miles away, Fox13 reported.

Tragic: Kayelyn Louder, 30, (pictured left and right) vanished from her home in Murray, Utah in September and her body has now been found in a river five miles away. Authorities do not yet know how it got there

In the hours before she went missing, Louder had contacted 911 to report a fight at a wedding and then an intruder in her apartment - although police found no evidence of either.

She did not have any history of mental health issues although her father said she had experienced 'a little bit of depression' due to her recent employment status.

'She's been in and out of jobs for the last year,' Jesse Louder told KSL after her disappearance.

Investigators have said that the surveillance footage shows her talking excitedly. It appears that her black Chinese pug Phyllis is in the video with her, but the dog was later found unharmed.

After stepping out of the final frame of the footage, she was not seen again.

Heartbreaking: The discovery on Monday brings some closure to her family after nine weeks of searches

'We don't know what happened,' Allen Robins, a private investigator for the Louder family, told Fox. 'No one else saw her. No one has any other details as to what had happened from when she left that frame until [Monday].' 

A roommate alerted authorities after she realized she had not heard from Louder, known as 'Kiki' to her friends, in a while.

Following her disappearance, friends and family launched a massive search for the woman through social media and raised more than $8,000 online to help the efforts.

Shortly after news that her body had been found, her family released a statement.

'We are broken hearted with the news of Kayelyn's body being found, but are also grateful to know where she is,' it said. 

Last sighting: She was captured on surveillance footage on September 27 but has not been seen since

Loved: She had no history of mental illness but it emerged that she called 911 multiple times about non-existent crimes in the hours before she vanished. Her father said she had been low about her job

'This has been an extremely difficult 9+ weeks for all involved. We hope that through all of our efforts that she has been able to see how much she is loved and cared for. 

'We are forever grateful to the volunteers who have helped us in countless ways over the past 9 weeks. We are amazed at your love and dedication to our family.

'While finding her brings some closure we still have many unanswered questions and will not rest until we are able to fully understand what happened.' 

A candlelight vigil will be held in remembrance of Kayelyn in Murray Park at 5.15pm on Thursday.
