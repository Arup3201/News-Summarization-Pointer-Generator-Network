For decades they have been the shoe of choice for the rebel, rocker, punk and goth, but Doc Martens may soon be losing their alternative edge.

The family-run company behind the iconic boots was sold for an incredible £300 million to Permira this week, a decidedly straight-laced private equity firm that also owns New Look, Hugo Boss and over-50's company Saga.

Fans of the anti-establishment shoes, which have graced the feet of some of the most famous and controversial celebrities over the brand's 66-year history, will likely be worried that the change in ownership will mean the end of the traditional Doc Marten.

Doc Martens have managed to become mainstream and a celebrity favourite- with names such as Katy Perry and Agyness Deyn spotted in the boots- whilst maintaining their unmistakable cool.

The company, which has been run by the Griggs family since its beginnings, has spoken out to reassure fans that the sub-culture institution will not change.

Chief executive David Suddens says: 'I thought private equity (firms) were supposed to be the skinheads of the financial community. There's  no way we're going to lose the company's culture or ethos.

'They'll leave the management to carry on doing what the management does.'

The family, from Northamptonshire, have also reassured their 350 British, and 350 global staff that there will be no large changes to the company.

Doc Martens began when Klaus Märtens teamed up with his university  friend Dr. Herbert Funck to help sell the air cushioned boots Märtens  had designed after injuring his foot while skiing.

In 1959 British shoe manufacturer R. 
Griggs Group Ltd brought the rights to sell the boots in the UK and the 
legendary brand began.

The 
first ever style of shoe Doc Martens brought out, known as style 1460, 
was first sold in 1960 and is still being produced today.

The company went from strength to strength and now sells across the globe, recently opening stores in China, making profits of £22.9 million last year alone.

Under the new terms the Griggs family, along with Dr Martens' management, will keep a 20 per cent share in the company, while Märtens and Dr Funck will continue to get royalties.
