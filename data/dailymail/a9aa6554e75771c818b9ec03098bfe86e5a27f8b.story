The Tory party under David Cameron is now more divided than when John Major was leader, a devastating new opinion poll reveals today.

Mr Cameron’s grip on his party has been weakened in recent weeks after public splits over Europe, gay marriage and public spending.

Divided parties rarely prosper in elections and two thirds of voters now believe the Prime Minister lacks the skills needed to win in 2015.

Split: David Cameron is on holiday in Ibiza but back home voters think the Tory party is now more divided thasn when John Major was Prime Minister in the 1990s

Poll: Labour's lead has been slashed to just four points in the latest ComRes poll, which puts UKIP on a record high of 17 points

Mr Cameron remains on holiday in Ibiza this week, but when MPs return from their latest recess Tory unrest is expected to re-emerge.

More than half of voters (56 per cent) now believe that Conservative divisions run deeper than when John Major saw his party disintegrate in the mid-1990s.

Worryingly for Mr Cameron, the splits which undermined Sir John’s government were fuelled by disagreement over Europe.

Voters believe Mr Cameron lacks leadership skills needed to win the 2015 while the Tory party is split

The Prime Minister sought to quell mutiny in Tory ranks with the promise of an in-out Europe referendum, after negotiating a  ‘fresh settlement’ with Brussels.

But 114 Tory MPs voted to express ‘regret’ that the referendum was not included in the Queen’s Speech.

In an unprecedented move, the Prime Minister has told his MPs they must scrap constituency meetings to vote through a Bill being launched by backbench Tory MP James Wharton.

Mr Wharton has adopted a private members’ bill that has been drawn up by Tory high command because the Lib Dems refused to allow it to be presented as a government Bill.

It promises a referendum by the end of 2017 following a renegotiation of Britain’s role in Brussels.

The tougher stance on Europe comes as Tories scrabble to deal with the threat posed by the UK Independence Party.

In the latest opinion poll by ComRes for The Independent, support for UKIP has climbed to a record high of 17 per cent, up four points on last month.

The Tories are on 30 per cent, just four points behind Labour on 34 per cent. The Lib Dems are on 10 per cent.

Worryingly for Mr Cameron, 72 per cent of UKIP voters believe the Tory party is more split now than under John Major, along with 59 per cent of Conservative voters.

Almost two thirds of voters (61 per cent) do not think that Mr Cameron ‘has the leadership qualities required to win a majority at the next general election in 2015’.

It includes 30 per cent of Conservative voters and 86 per cent of UKIP supporters.

ComRes interviewed 1,000 GB adults by telephone between 24 and 26 May.
