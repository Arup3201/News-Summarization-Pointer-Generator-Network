If you have ever wanted to pout like Kim Kardashian or to make a speech in the style of Barack Obama, a new app lets you try on their faces so you can do a convincing impression.

An open-source Javascript project lets people sitting in front of a webcam 're-skin' their face as someone more famous, including Audrey Hepburn and Queen Elizabeth II.

Users can pull faces in front of a camera and see themselves react as their favourite celebrity in an effect that is almost like digital plastic surgery.

famous, including Kim Kardashian (pictured right)

Norwegian computer scientist Audun Øygard created CLMtrackr so that a webcam can map 70 distinct points on a person’s face and then put someone else’s facial features on top of them in a web browser.

The technology works in realtime so that the celebrity mask mirrors a user’s facial expressions.

Mr Øygard told Co.Design: ‘It's a really eerie effect to “wear” someone else's face when you're mostly used to seeing your own face in the mirror.

‘I noticed that I subconsciously changed my facial expressions depending on which face I was “wearing,” which was kind of funny.’

Mr Øygard was inspired to create his software, having seen the work of Kyle McDonalds, who also made an app to enable 'facial substitution'. Here, a user pouts as Paris Hilton

Kyle McDonalds also made an app to enable 'facial substitution' where he  shows how a user can pull faces as Marilyn Monroe, Steve Jobs and Salvador Dali (pictured)

While it is reported that the software can struggle to keep a mask in place if a user moves their head too suddenly, it does skew a person’s sense of self.

‘I think a lot of things are coming together right now that makes it possible to change or augment your perception of reality,’ Mr Øygard said.

‘Face substitution is one of the things which probably will get much better over time and we'll see it pop up more places.’

Mr Øygard was inspired to create his software, having seen the work of Kyle McDonalds, who also made an app to enable 'facial substitution' where he shows how a user can pull faces as Marilyn Monroe, Salvador Dali, Steve Jobs, Michael Jackson and Paris Hilton, to name but a few celebrities featured in a demonstration video.

While the technology currently allows users to have fun virtually dressing up as celebrities, including Marilyn Monroe, it could pave the way for advanced video chatting services and facial recognition apps

Users report that the software skews their sense
 of self and they tend to adopt similar facial expressiosn to those 
regularly shown by the celebrity whose face they are trying on. Left, is

He explained in a blog post that fitting a facial model is useful for pinpointing facial features for detecting an emotion or identifying someone.

The app is based on an algorithm used to fit a facial model to a real face in a video and consists of 70 points or ‘classifiers’.

Given an approximate position, the classifiers search a small region around each facial point to get the best fit for the mask.

Face substitution will get much better over time and will be used in more situations than simply trying on celebrities' features for fun. Here, a software demo shows a young man with the Queen's features superimposed on his face. Queen Elizabeth II is pictured right

Mr Øygard said there is room for improvement, as the app does not fit 'postures' that deviate from the average very well.

He said a 3D model instead of a 2D one could help to make the software more accurate, but building a 3D model is more difficult.

If the concept is made to look more realistic, it could perhaps be used as an alternative to real plastic surgery in the future, as people could create their ideal appearance to use online.
