The mystery of what happened to a historic Stradivarius violin stolen in a stun gun attack has been revealed as Milwaukee police recovered the instrument this week.

The violin, built in 1715 by Antonio Stradivari and valued at $5 million, was found hidden in a suitcase in the attic of a man who had no idea the instrument was there, police say.

The heist has been blamed in part on an art thief who once tried to sell a statue back to the gallery he had stolen it from.

Three people have been arrested in the case, and Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn said there was no evidence of other 'shadowy' figures from the art world being behind the theft.

'It appears we had a local criminal who had an interest in art theft and was smart enough to develop a plan for a robbery,' Flynn said. 'Beyond that, we don't know what his motive was.'

The violin, which police said appeared to be in good condition, was stolen last week from concert violinist Frank Almond, who was shocked with a stun gun. His attacker grabbed the violin and hopped into a waiting vehicle.

Police traced the stun gun to Universal Knowledge Allah, a 36-year-old barber. A citizen's tip led police to Salah Jones, the 41-year-old convicted of stealing a $25,000 statue from a gallery at Milwaukee's Pfister Hotel in 1995.

Officers had the men under surveillance before arresting them Monday, along with a 32-year-old woman who was later released from custody.

Police also have not said what role each suspect had in the heist.

Milwaukee District Attorney John Chisholm said Thursday that he expected to charge at least one of the suspects Friday.

He said charges were delayed while prosecutors negotiated with one suspect for the return of the violin.

On Wednesday night the suspect led police to the home of an acquaintance, who had allowed the suspect to store a suitcase in his attic.

Concertmaster Almond thanked police for finding the violin so quickly, and expressed gratitude at the emotional support he had received from the community.

'It was truly heartening during what was obviously a very difficult time. I could not have imagined a better outcome for this particular chapter in the violin's life and look forward to having it in my hands as soon as possible,' he told the Chicago Tribune.

It is not clear what the suspects planned to do with the violin. Such high-value instruments are almost always well-documented with photographs and easily identified, David Bonsey, a New York-based violin maker and appraiser who appears on Antiques Roadshow, said.

'There's virtually no place that a violin like this can be taken and fenced,' Bonsey said. 'You can't take it to a pawn shop.'

Some art collectors will buy stolen objects that they keep hidden for their own enjoyment, Bonsey said. But Police Chief Flynn said there was no indication in this case of 'shadowy figures in the art world that were trying to purchase this' violin.

The violin, known in musical circles as the Lipinski Stradivarius because it was once played by Polish violinist Karol Lipinski, has been appraised for insurance purposes at $5 million.

It has value as a musical instrument and as a work of art, Bonsey said.

The violin is 'part of a body of work from someone whose work just cannot be imitated,' he said. 'A lot of people do sculptures, but there's only one Michelangelo.'

Experts estimate 600 to 650 Stradivarius instruments remain - about half of what the master produced.

One of the most famous is the Gibson Strad, owned by virtuoso Joshua Bell. It was stolen from Carnegie Hall in 1936 and not found until the violinist who stole it died in the 1980s.

FBI special agent David Bass, an expert in art crime, said Stradivarius thefts are reported every few years but most instruments are found.

A Stradivarius stolen from a South Korean musician in 2010 while she ate at a London sandwich shop was found about three years later at a property in central England. Three people were convicted in that theft.

Attack: The violin was stolen from outside Wisconsin Lutheran College, where Frank Almond had been playing

The Lipinski Stradivarius was taken from Almond, concertmaster for the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra, as he walked to his car after a January 27 performance at Wisconsin Lutheran College.

Mark Niehaus, the orchestra's president and executive director, said the instrument appeared in good shape, but Almond, who also teaches music at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois has not yet seen it and had time to inspect it.

The Lipinski Stradivarius was crafted in 1715 by Antonio Stradiveri.

An early owner was composer Guiseppe Tartini, who gave it to his student, Salvini.

Salvini passed ownership to Polish violinist Karol Lipinski. After Lipinski played for him, Salvini is said to have smashed the musician's violin, before handing him the Stradivarius and saying, 'Try this instrument'.

After Lipinski's death in 1861 the violin was acquired by Engelbert Röntgen, and it stayed with his family for three generations.

In the 1940s the violin was sent to Cuba, where it was owned by a supporter of the Havana Symphony. But after fleeing the revolution, the violinist was forced to sell the instrument so he could start a new life in the U.S.

It was bought in New York in 1962 by Evi Liivak, an Estonian who played secret concerts to keep spirits raised during the Nazi occupation.

In 2008, Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra's  Frank Almond was given the violin on permanent loan.

The violin was on loan to Almond by 
its owner. Such arrangements are common in classical music in part 
because most artists can't afford instruments worth millions of dollars.

The owners benefit as well because use keeps the instruments in good 
shape and can add to their value.

'When
 famous people play these instruments it builds what we call the 
instrument's provenance,' Bonsey said. 'It adds to the value of the 
instrument down the road.'

The violin had been previously owned by a string of high-profile musicians, including Devil's Trill composer Giuseppe Tartini, and Polish violinist Karol Lipinski.

It had survived the Cuban revolution,
 during which its sale helped a Havana musician escape to the U.S., and 
was used in concerts across Europe by a woman who escaped the Nazis.

Almond was offered the use of the violin in 2008, when a family 
clearing the estate of a dead relative contacted the concertmaster to 
ask his opinion of an instrument they had found. 

In an interview with The Violinist last
 year, Almond recalled how he had at first been skeptical, saying 
that he is regularly contacted by people who believe they have found a 
rare instrument.

After
 meeting the owners, who showed him paperwork and old concert programs, 
Mr Almond was led to a bank vault where the precious violin had been 
stored for 20 years.

'It
 turned out that they had put it in a bank vault - a regular bank vault 
at M & I Bank, which happened to be about, I'd say, 100 yards from 
the concert hall,' Almond said. 

'It was ironic - I'd been playing all the time in this hall, and there was a 1715 Strad, down the street in a bank vault.'

The
 violin had an impressive pedigree, and allowed Mr Almond to perform on 
an instrument once used by 'godfather of modern violin playing' Tartini, and Lipinski.

'If
 you start thinking about everything behind that instrument, it's easy 
to feel quite tiny,' Mr Almond said in a previous interview. 'Sure, it 
was creepy to play the Devil's Trill sonata for the first couple times. 
But that's what the violin is for: playing.

'It's going to be here a lot longer than I am, and every day that I'm able to play on it, to me, it's amazing.'

Its last owner had been a child prodigy from Estonia, whose music studies in Budapest were cut short when her father was killed by the Gestapo.

Evi Liivak was known for playing secret concerts in bunkers to raise the spirits of those living under Nazi oppression.

She took possession of the violin in New York in 1962, when her husband, a Milwaukee pianist, bought it for $19,000 from a Cuban who was forced to sell it after escaping Havana.

Its enticing history led Mr Almond to record A Violin's Life in tribute to it. The CD features him playing pieces that had been composed or were associated with its various owners in the past 300 years.
