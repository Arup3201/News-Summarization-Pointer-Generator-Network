The haggard-looking woman in this mugshot will hope this horribly unflattering photo disappears very quickly.

The picture is of Emmerli Wilcoxson - who stole a cop car and led police on a 130mph chase before screaming into their radio as she crashed the vehicle and caused a pile-up.

The 40-year-old was stopped while high on synthetic marijuana on a street in Atlanta, Georgia, after police claimed she matched the description of a woman reportedly armed in the area. 

Not a pretty picture: Emmerli Wilcoxson's haggard and bruised mugshot after she was arrested following high-speed crash on Sunday 

Amazingly, she managed to steal the police's patrol during the incident in Cobb County on Sunday. 

After jumping into the vehicle, she sped away towards Interstate 75 at more than 130mph before slamming into the rear end of a Chevy Cavalier - causing serious injuries to the other driver's lower body.

The two cars collided with two more vehicles before crashing into a concrete partition, the New York Daily News reports. 

Emergency workers transported Wilcoxson to a local hospital after the crash on Sunday.

She was treated for head trauma before being taken to the Cobb County Jail the following day.

Looking utterly dejected and bruised after the reckless car theft - Wilcoxson will not be savouring the photo taken by police.

A witness to the crime, William Michael Jones, said: 'We saw two police cars coming. They were going at a high rate of speed. We tried to get out of the way'

'I told my wife, 'They're going to wreck — they're going too fast.' 

It is not yet known what charges she faces.
