She was offered the chance to exact retribution on the man who blinded her with acid in the same horrific manner.

But, at the last minute, Ameneh Bahrami, 34, refused, preferring her attacker, a former university classmate, to be spared.

What happened next, though, has enraged her.

For Iranian authorities have declared Ms Bahrami no longer has a right to the compensation Majid Movahedi was ordered to pay by the courts. She needs the money to pay for more plastic surgery to her disfigured face and body.

Movahedi: After being pardoned, his sentence was reduced to 10 years in prison

She now says she was cheated, and is now suing Iran's judiciary, the Independent reports.

Ms Bahrami, suffered severe injuries 
to her eyes, face and hands when Movahedi threw acid in her face in 2004
after she spurned his hand in marriage.

In November 2008, a criminal court in
Tehran ordered Movahedi to be blinded in both eyes under the country's 
application of the sharia code of 'qisas', which allows retribution for 
violent crimes.

But in July, he was given an eleventh hour reprieve when Ms Bahrami exercised her right to pardon him.

Prison officials had been preparing to drop acid into his eyes when the pardon was delivered.

Miss Bahrami said the international 
interest in the case was one reason for deciding to drop her demand for 
the sentence to be carried out: 'It seemed like the 
entire world was waiting to see what we did.'

The case attracted international 
media attention, and the human rights group Amnesty International urged 
Iran not to inflict the retributive form of punishment.

After being pardoned, Movahedi's 
sentence was reduced to 10 years in prison. It is as a result of this new sentence that judiciary 
figures now say he no longer has to pay compensation.

'Even though I agreed to pardon Mr 
Movahedi, I didn't think I was surrendering my right to compensation,' 
Ms Bahrami told the Independent.

She said her request for compensation was recognised at the time as legal by judiciary officials.

'But then the deputy prosecutor said 
he had made a mistake and that my request for compensation had no legal 
grounds,' she added.

Ms Bahrami says she needs the money 
to pay for further surgery. She has already spent more than £150,000 – 
partly funded by the Iranian state – on treatment but more is needed.

After being told she was no longer 
entitled to compensation, Ms Bahrami says she was persuaded by Tehran's 
deputy prosecutor to sign a document limiting her claim to injuries to 
her hands and face.

Now she has been told by a lawyer that the prosecutor's ruling is in fact unlawful.

She has responded by opening legal 
proceedings against the deputy prosecutor for abuse of trust and 
depriving her of her legal rights.

'If Majid Movahedi walks out of 
prison without paying the compensation money for my eyes, it means I 
have been subjected to injustice,' she said.
