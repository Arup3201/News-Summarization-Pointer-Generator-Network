Warning: US Vice President Joe Biden will warn David Cameron about leaving the EU when he visits Downing Street on Tuesday

The US is to warn David Cameron not to pull out of the EU, as new polling shows the Prime Minister received minimal benefit from his offer of an in/out referendum.

Vice-President Joe Biden will fire a fresh shot across Mr Cameron’s bows when he visits Downing Street on Tuesday – following talks with French and German leaders.

A senior adviser to Mr Biden said: ‘With respect to Prime Minister Cameron’s speech, we obviously support his comments about the important role of the UK in the EU.’

A second aide added: ‘It’s in our interest for there to be a strong UK in a strong EU.’

Mr Biden will hold talks with Nick Clegg in Downing Street before holding a ‘working lunch’ with Mr Cameron and attending a meeting of the National Security Council.

The fresh pressure on Mr Cameron comes as a poll commissioned by Tory peer Lord Ashcroft found that his Europe speech has not shifted attitudes to the Conservative Party or changed the proportion of people who want to see a Tory government after the next election.

Labour’s lead has shrunk to five points – with the Tories on 33 per cent to Labour’s 38 per cent – but the change largely resulted from Conservative voters at the last election becoming more likely to vote Tory again and some existing supporters saying they were more likely to turn out.

Lord Ashcroft said: ‘The speech, and more importantly the policy it articulated, has made Tories feel better about being Tories.

‘This is not to be sneezed at – but 
let’s not confuse it with having changed anybody’s mind. Back in 
December less than three in five of 2010 Tory voters said they would 
vote Conservative in an election tomorrow; after the speech that number 
had risen to two in three.’

While Tories have warmed to the Prime Minister, he has a battle on his hands to persuade allies and party grandees.

Former Tory Chancellor Geoffrey Howe yesterday accused him of making his speech to silence Tory critics rather than out of principle.

Lord Howe, who helped bring down Margaret Thatcher because he regarded her as too Eurosceptic, told a Lords debate: ‘I would like to think I was wrong in suspecting that the Prime Minister’s sudden conversion to the merits of a referendum is less about occupying the moral high ground of democratic consent than the search for a means to overcome the problems of internal party management.’

Meanwhile, Europhile minister Ken 
Clarke was slapped down yesterday for undermining the Government’s first
attempt to repatriate powers from Brussels.

No change: A poll commissioned by Tory peer Lord Ashcroft found that his Europe speech has not shifted attitudes to the Conservative Party

Home Secretary Theresa May last year announced that she planned to opt out of 140 European Union rules related to crime and justice, including extradition and the European Arrest Warrant.

Yesterday Mr Clarke claimed ministers were ready to hand 30 criminal justice powers back to the European Union, but was accused by senior government sources of ‘getting ahead of himself’.

The Home Office insisted no decision had yet been made. A spokesman said: ‘We have made a commitment to a vote in both Houses of Parliament before we take a final decision. That vote will take place in good time before 2014.’

A senior Lib Dem source said: ‘There’s a lot of common ground between Ken Clarke and the Liberal Democrats on Europe but he’s getting ahead of himself'.
