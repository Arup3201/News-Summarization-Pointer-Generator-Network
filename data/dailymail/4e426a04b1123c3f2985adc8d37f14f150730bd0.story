Designing a clothing range, working on her solo pop career and fronting beauty campaigns - is Nicole Scherzinger the hardest working girl in showbiz?

Judging by her latest gig, it would seem so. The former Pussycat Doll is again the face of Herbal Essences' new range and looks every inch the Moroccan goddess in the campaign imagery.

Nicole, who has been the brand's ambassador since last year, has unveiled the latest collection, Moroccan My Shine.

Speaking about the product range, she said: 'I love the Shampoo and Conditioner, it keeps my hair super shiny and also smells 
amazing.

'It’s a little bit of gorge-wah magic in a bottle and after 
shampooing and conditioning, my hair is restored to touchable best.'

Aside from her duties with the haircare giant, the former X Factor judge, 35, has been busy creating a new clothing line for Missguided, which went on sale earlier this month.

The debut 30-piece collection aims to
 take influence directly from Nicole’s statement style, uniting her 
favourite signature looks with the season's most coveted trends.

'It's
 inspired by the catwalk mixed with my personal style. I would describe 
it as clean, sexy, strong,' she told MailOnline at the time.

Hawaiian-born Nicole, who was ranked 
VH1's Sexiest Artist of All Time this year, also opened up her beauty bag for FEMAIL- 
and fans will be pleased to hear that she loves a good budget buy.

'I
 love Dr Murad toner and I really like the Bliss Triple Oxygen Instant 
Energising Eye Masks, they're really tingly and I use them every other 
day,' she said.

'I love the SK-II Facial Treatment Mask too, it is yummy!

'I love my creme blushes, illuminator,
 and moisturiser is everything to me because it keeps your skin fresh 
and dewy and not too cakey.'

Sharing her budget beauty tips, she said: 'My family makes coconut oil so I get that for free!

'It's so healthy for the skin, it's anti-bacterial, it is everything. You can use it for your hair and skin.

'Whatever
 lip gloss you have, use it on your cheeks too, I do that a lot. I also 
love the Boots eye make-up remover pads and No. 7 has good face wash.'

In the past few weeks, Nicole has been spending a lot of time in the studio working on her solo music career.

She said: 'I am so excited for my fans to hear this. I look forward to them welcoming me back into the music world.'

Fishnet fan: Nicole said she is a
 huge fan of the fishnet pieces, which she designed them to look edgy 
but still be classy, she says
