An 81-year-old Florida woman is behind bars for repeatedly feeding black bears at home after being warned to stop by a judge multiple times.

Mary Musselman from Sebring is now facing charges ranging from violating probation to battery on a law enforcement officer.

Mrs Musselman, a retired gym teacher who worked at the local middle school, is described her as gentle hearted, sweet and someone who is harmless. She is also an animal love, but therein lies her downfall.

Jailed: 81-year-old Mary Musselman, a retired gym teacher from central Florida is behind bars after feeding bears bowls of dog food despite being told not to on several occasions

Ignored: Florida resident Mary Musselman didn't listen, officials said. The authorities had warned her multiple times not to feed the black bears coming onto her property

No sign of stopping: Mrs Musselman would feed the bears 17 to 18 bowls of dog food at a time. The bears loved it and kept coming back. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission hated it and kept coming back, too

Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission officials told ABC Action News the trouble with Mrs Musselman began last year when they had to euthanize a black bear she kept feeding.

'Feeding bears results in bears losing their fear of people,' explained Gary Morse from Florida Wildlife Commission spokesperson.

Once bears learn a particular behavior, they cannot be relocated because the animal's natural instincts are disrupted.

Wildlife Officers even spent time to educate Mrs Musselman about the dangers of feeding wildlife showing her educational videos and leaving her with information  pamphlets.

'She told us she wasn't going to stop,' Mr Morse recalled.

After several more warnings in November, FWC officers went back to her property after hearing she had been feeding two more bears.

Risky: They went to great lengths to explain to her why she shouldn't give the wild animals food, said FWC spokesman Gary Morse. They brought her informational videos and pamphlets, had conversations with her

Problem: Feeding bears results in bears losing their fear of people. After they get used to living around humans and getting food from them, relocating them does not solve the problem

Officers came back with more educational videos and told her that she would be visited weekly.

After being summoned to appear in court in December, a judge ordered her Mrs Musselman to stop feeding all wild animals, however just before Christmas, at least three bears were being given large amount of food with up to 18 bowls of dog food being left out for them.

A judge found her guilty of two counts of feeding wildlife and she was placed on probation for one year.

Just before New Years Eve, Mrs Musselmen was once again found to be feeding bears and she was arrested.

'Unfortunately, she didn't heed the warnings,' Mr Morse said.

When FWC officers arrested Mrs Musselman, she threatened to them.

'Feeding wildlife puts the community at risk from property destruction to possible danger of life and limb,' Mr Morse explained.

Mrs Musselman reportedly told officers she had to feed the bears or they would starve to death.

'She didn't want to accept that fact that they'd be fine without her...they hibernate when there is no food,' Mr Morse added.

Some of Mrs Musselman's former students over the the past forty years gathered outside her home and prayed for her.

They have tried to bail her out but she is being held without bond.

Many say her behavior is out of character. They want to get her back home as soon as possible because her husband is dying of cancer.

Mrs Musselmen is not slated to appear in court until March 3rd.
