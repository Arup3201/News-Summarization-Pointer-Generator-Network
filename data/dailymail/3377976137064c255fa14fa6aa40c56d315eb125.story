The Ohio teacher whose skull was crushed by a five-pound rock dropped through her car windscreen from a Pennsylvania overpass is recovering from her sixth surgery - and celebrated with a birthday party.

Sharon Budd turned 53 at home on Thanksgiving Day after what doctors branded a 'miracle' recovery.

Incredibly, the mother-of-four was walking, talking and in good spirits despite enduring a sixth operation just a week earlier to remove contaminated parts of her plastic skull reconstruction.

Celebration: Sharon Budd rings a ceremonial victory bell outside Geisinger HealthSouth Rehabilitation Hospital in Danville, Pennsylvania on Tuesday - signaling that she is ready to return home after three months

Her husband told The Repository in Canton she was out of her hospital bed within days. 

Mrs Budd, a middle school teacher and breast cancer survivor, had five surgical procedures in three months to after four teenage boys allegedly threw a rock at her family car during a road trip to New York. 

Doctors were forced to remove a portion of her facial bones to ease the brain swelling.

But despite suffering brain damage, a crushed skull and losing an eye, Geisinger HealthSouth Rehabilitation Hospital in Danville, Pennsylvania, gushed about Mrs Budd's upbeat survivor's spirit left a huge impression on caregivers.

'She’s just improved by leaps and bounds. She’s walking all over the facility. She walks in and lights up every room. She has such a great personality and is such a pleasure to work with,' Sharon’s physical therapist Chelsea Matukaitis told WNEP. 

For her part, though, Sharon remained modest even as medical staff and relatives gushed about her recovery outside the health center, where the 52-year-old mother rang a ceremonial bell, as is tradition for patients who've fought long battles there. 

'Just unbelievable that that many people know who I am and know the story and things,' but, she said, she's 'very excited about going home.'

Her husband, too, marveled at Sharon's recovery. 

On the road to recovery: Mrs Budd has been recovering for three months after a rock was thrown from an Interstate 80 overpass in Pennsylvania and shattered her skull. She lost her right eye in the incident

'She’s so strong and I don’t know how she did it. To be able to walk out there and answer these questions out here in front of everyone is a miracle,' Randy Budd said.

Helped by two staff members, she grinned as she rang the ceremonial victory bell.

The couple planned to return home to Uniontown, Ohio on Wednesday.

When previously asked what was the first thing she wanted when she got home, she told PennLive: 'A loaf of bread and an entire package of English muffins. I'll stand by the toaster for an hour and a half.'  

She was the front-seat passenger of her family's car as it drove through Danville on July 10 with her husband and daughter, when the rock crashed through the front window and struck her head. 

Budd, who had just finished speaking to her son before he was deployed to Afghanistan, suffered a crushed skull and brain damage. She also lost her right eye.

She has  - but has suffered setbacks with seizures.

Excitement: Randy Budd speaks to his wife on Tuesday as she prepares to head back home to Ohio

Strength-to-strength: Mrs Budd suffered brain damage but is able to manage simple math, her husband said

Her husband said on Tuesday that her sense of humor has returned, she is able to walk and she has regained limited vision in her left eye. Her long-term prognosis remains uncertain.

'They told us to look at this a year from now to give a measurement of how Sharon's going to be, who is Sharon going to be,' Randy Budd said. 

She can perform simple math and knows who the president is and that it's 2014, Randy Budd said. But she can be confused about how many children she has or how she got hurt, he said.

'Some basics, she doesn't have,' Randy Budd said. 'That's to be expected. The brain has to reconnect itself.' 

But there are encouraging signs so far, he said: 'She could have come back bitter, violent, aggressive, but she came back as kind of her sweet self.'

'This word gets thrown around a lot, but I really believe the angels came down to help her,' he said. 

Four young men face charges in the attack.

One of them testified at a preliminary hearing in August that they set out to do damage that day, starting with shoplifting and driving through a corn field and ending up on the Interstate 80 overpass shortly before midnight.

Keefer McGee, 18, testified under a deal with prosecutors that they laughed as they drove away from the scene after hearing the noise of the rock hitting the Budd family's vehicle.

'They weren't looking for a car to hit in particular,' said McGee, who told the judge he had been involved in unspecified earlier rock-throwing incidents. 'Like, they weren't waiting for one. They hit one as they saw it.' 

He drove them back to the Lahr home, where they began to watch a movie before deciding to return to the scene to see what happened — twice. During one of those trips, an alert police officer noted their license plate, leading investigators to the four.

Budd's husband Randy recalled the horror of that evening during the hearing. 

'It felt like an explosion,' he testified, calling his wife's injuries the 'most gruesome thing that I've ever seen.'

'I'm pretty sure I was looking at brains and skull and she, remarkably, kind of came to but wasn't saying anything,' he said. 'She was just jerking, grabbing her head, so we were holding her hands down.'  

Accused: Brett Lahr, 18, left, and his brother, 17-year-old Dylan Lahr, and two others have been charged with aggravated assault and conspiracy charges in the shocking incident three months ago

One of the four told police that the oblong-shaped rock was dropped by Dylan Lahr, 17.

The lawyer for the only defendant who did not waive his preliminary hearing, Brett Lahr, 19, said this week he was glad to hear Sharon Budd was being released but maintains criminal charges should not have been filed against him.

'Just because you're riding along with people who do some stuff, and even alleged to have laughed if it happened, which we dispute, does not mean you should be even tried for a crime,' said the defense attorney, Brian Manchester. 'You have to have some active involvement.'
