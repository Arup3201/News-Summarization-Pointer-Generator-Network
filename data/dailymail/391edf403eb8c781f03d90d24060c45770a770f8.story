A Serious Case Review following the death of a teenager who was tied to a tree, tortured, sexually assaulted and killed has recommended 111 separate changes in procedure to the agencies that dealt with her.

It found the extent of her vulnerabilities 'was not understood by professionals working with her' and a found a wealth of ways agencies care of her was 'weak'.

Hannah Windsor, 17, suffered an horrific death last May at the hands of her sadistic boyfriend Adam Lewis, who pleaded guilty to murder, two charges of assault, burglary, and arson at his trial last year and denied two charges of rape.

He was ordered to serve a minimum of 22 years in jail when he appeared at Liverpool Crown Court.

Mr Justice Holroyde had told Lewis: 'This was a prolonged, merciless and terrible attack which must have been agonisingly painful for Hannah Windsor before she died.'

The case review was ordered immediately following the hearing.

The report, which is anonymised - referring to Hannah as 'Child G' - contains 111 separate recommendations for changes to procedures, training and issuing extra guidance to staff.

It found that although her murder at the hands of Lewis could not reasonably have been forseen, service provision by the professional agencies that were supposed to look after her was 'diffuse and lacked co-ordination'.

In the days before Hannah’s death, Lewis had been sleeping rough hiding out on Bidston Hill after a warrant was issued for his arrest for burglary and arson.

The report describes how Hannah was helping police find him but had been warned about approaching the killer by a policewoman. However she ignored the advice.

CCTV pictures released after the trial showed the teenager walking along a leafy pathway at the hill as she went to meet him. She was dead a matter of hours later and her body discovered under twigs and leaves.

The review charts how Hannah had a difficult childhood and discloses that over the years, the youngster had contact with a large number of agencies and organisations.

Representative of health, education, social care, police, youth offending and housing services were all involved.

But no multi-agency 'holistic' assessment of her needs, characteristics and behaviour took place.

The review found:

In February 2012, she was provided with accommodation as a homeless young person.

An assessment should have taken place at this point to consider whether she was 'in need' and required local authority accommodation.

The report found that although Hannah was found to have been neglected, there was almost no challenge to those responsible about the care they provided for her.

The report says a such a plan is the basic requirement of child protection work and each member of the core group had individual, as well as collective, responsibility to Hannah to ensure that this requirement was met.

Local Safeguarding Children’s Board procedures and good practice guides were not systematically consulted and were not always applied as they were intended to be.

A press release from Wirral Council states: 'The review found that agencies working with [Hannah] could not have foreseen what happened to her.'

It continues: 'The overview report makes recommendations, all of which are now part of an action plan which will be reviewed and updated regularly by the Local Safeguarding Children’s Board.

Dennis Charlton, independent chairman of the board, said: 'I would like, on behalf of all members of the LSCB, to extend our deepest condolences to Child G’s family and anyone who knew her.

'I know that a number of people who work for agencies associated with Child G’s care knew her personally, and were greatly affected and saddened by her death.

'The board have accepted the findings and recommendations of the Review which was commissioned by the LSCB following Child G’s death.

'We are already working on a number of areas which have been identified, where assessments, multi-agency work and information sharing were not of a sufficient standard to provide a framework for co-ordinated actions and interventions.'

Progress on these recommendations will be monitored and updated regularly by the LSCB, and the results will contribute to child protection practice in Wirral and will be used to inform further action and training.

The review found Hannah 'was not adequately diverted from harmful activities.'

@highlight

The local authority 'did not adequately consider its responsibilities under the Children Act to provide accommodation to her.'
