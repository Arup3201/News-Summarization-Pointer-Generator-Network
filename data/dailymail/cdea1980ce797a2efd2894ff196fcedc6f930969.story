A soldier watched in horror as his father and sister were killed when the family’s private plane crashed yards from their country landing strip.

Jack Newton, 23, sprinted to the wreckage to find businessman David, 56, and university student Rebecca, 21, had been horrifically maimed in the light aircraft crash.

After begging local farmers for help, paramedics were called to the site in Wymeswold, Leicestershire, but the father and daughter were pronounced dead at the scene.

As emotional tributes were paid to Mr and Miss Newton, investigators are now trying to work out what caused the tragic accident.

Mr Newton, an experienced pilot nicknamed ‘Dangerous Dave’, is understood to have lost control of the two-seater plane just 300 yards away from the runway.

It is thought that moments after taking off at just before 8pm on Wednesday evening, the Europa XS aircraft, which Mr Newton had owned since 2009, suddenly came down, crashing into farmland with such force that the nose and tail of the plane broke off on impact.

Eye-witnesses said Jack, who had been 
watching his family fly from nearby, ran over to the wreckage before seeking help from farmers.

Billy
Dunne, 53, whose Common Farm home overlooks the crash site about 200 
yards away, said: ‘A young lad came running across the field. [At first]
he couldn’t speak. He said a plane had crashed and was shouting about 
getting the ambulance and the police.

‘I
ran across to try and help, but when I got there I saw there was 
nothing anyone could do, it was too late. He wanted to get his sister 
out, but I had to pull him back.

Tragedy: David Newton, 56, left, and his 23-year-old daughter Rebecca, right, were killed when the light aircraft they were flying in smashed into farmland in Wymeswold, at around 7.55pm on Wednesday

‘The
young lad was in a state of shock. He said it was his dad and his 
sister. I took his keys off him so he couldn’t drive and kept his car 
here for him. I think the police took him home.’

The farmer said no one could have survived the crash.

‘I was quite shocked when I went over 
to it. You couldn’t tell it was an aircraft, the cockpit had gone and 
the back of the plane had broken off. It was totally smashed, shattered 
to pieces. It was a mess,’ he added.

Mr Newton, who flew three times a week, was a director of a company specialising in air conditioning instillations.

He
lived with his children in a £250,000 house the village of Cropwell 
Bishop, Nottinghamshire, after becoming estranged from their mother, 
Sylvia.

Keen pilot: David Newton was a keen pilot who is pictured here in his light aircraft at an air show in Wickenby, Lincoln, in 2011

The businessman was a regular visitor to air shows and he was pictured landing his Europa XS in Wickenby, Lincoln, in 2011.

Paul Wheaton, who worked with him, wrote online: ‘Raising a glass in town to a good friend and work colleague who died unexpectedly on Wednesday.

‘I will miss the chats, your sense of humour and the pints in the Grinder.

‘Rest in peace and God Bless you Dangerous Dave.’

Rebecca, who was due to start her final year at Brunel University, lived in Southampton but had been visiting her family during the summer holiday.

The keen skier, who had worked as a volunteer for St John’s Ambulance for three years, is believed to have been in the passenger seat when the plane crashed.

Mr Newton’s son Jack is believed to have been in the Armed Forces since 2009, serving in Afghanistan until two years ago as a Guardsman in the Grenadier Guards’ 1st Battalion Inkerman Company.

A spokesman for Leicestershire Police said: ‘The two people who died in the light aircraft crash in Wymeswold earlier this week were father and daughter.

‘Formal identification of the deceased has not yet taken place and may not be done for some time.

‘Officers are working in conjunction with the Air Accident Investigations Branch to investigate the cause of the crash. It is believed the flight was taking off from the Wymeswold area.’
