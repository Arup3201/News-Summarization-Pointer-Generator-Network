Hit-and-run: Callum Hilton, 16, died after being knocked down as he crossed the road in Radcliffe, Bury, at around 6.30pm yesterday

The 16-year-old Manchester United fan was rushed to hospital after being knocked down by a silver Peugeot on the busy main road, where he later died from his injuries.

The driver sped from the scene at Stand 
Lane in Radcliffe, Bury, after the crash on Saturday evening.

A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said a man was arrested in Radcliffe shortly after 1.30pm today on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.

Callum's 'distraught' mother Tricia Hilton wrote on a Facebook tribute page set up in memory of the teenager: 'im not going to wake up from a nightmare, my son on the news hit and run... it shouldn't be happenin but now its all becoming real for me.'

The 16-year-old was raised by his mother and his grandfather, who have been left 'absolutely distraught' by the tragedy, Greater Manchester Police said.

A man who lives nearby and witnessed the 'heartbreaking' scene described how a neighbour, a nurse, and a passerby battled to save the boy as he lay in the road.

He said: 'As I was coming back home, the boy was already on the floor and there were two people offering first aid.

'One was a neighbour, a nurse who lives further up the hill and one was a guy who was driving past.

'With the boy were three friends, one was apparently his cousin but I don’t know any of them.

'It was heartbreaking to watch. The lad was in a very, very bad way.

'The frustration of standing there as two people try to save a young kid’s life was heartbreaking.'

He said cars were 'always' speeding up and down the road despite a number of signs warning drivers of the 30mph speed limit.

'There was a dog run over about 100 yards up the hill about 10 minutes before this boy was run over last night,' the man said.

'Last week a lady who lives down the road had her car struck.

'So just within this stretch of 200 yards there has been three accidents in a week. It’s very unfortunate.'

A bunch of flowers had been left in memory of the teenager at the scene today. The attached card read simply: 'Callum xxx'.

Nikki Jewell Howarth wrote on Facebook: 'Thinking of you tricia and family at this 
sad time, callum was a lovely lad and always had a smile on hes face 
much love nikki, kyle brandon, kiah, taylor and daisy may xx.'

Greater Manchester Police have appealed for any witnesses to come forward.

Detective Inspector Amber Waywell 
said: 'Callum's mum and grandad, who raised him, are absolutely 
distraught.

'They have suffered a terrible tragedy and have lost a son 
and a grandson in devastating circumstances.

'Our thoughts and sympathies are with them at this time and we have a 
specially-trained Family Liaison Officer who is supporting Callum's mum 
and grandad as they try to come to terms with what has happened.

'We have made an arrest but I would continue to appeal to anyone who witnessed the incident to come forward,' Det. Insp. Waywell added.

She added: 'Callum's family have suffered an unimaginable loss. He was 
just on his way to a party with friends and sadly will never be coming 
home to his family.

'They deserve to know exactly what happened so I 
would urge anyone who either witnessed what happened or has information 
about the movements of the silver Peugeot 206 to come forward.'

Shortly after the crash police recovered an abandoned silver Peugeot close to Bury town centre, but the vehicle has now been ruled out of the inquiry.

'It is now believed another silver Peugeot 206 was the vehicle involved,' a GMP spokesman said.

Anyone with information should call GMP on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
