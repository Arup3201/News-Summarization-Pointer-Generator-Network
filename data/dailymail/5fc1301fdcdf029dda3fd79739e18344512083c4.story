Culture lovers can now make instant donations to their favourite galleries, museums and theatres on their mobile phones thanks to a scheme launched today to protect the arts from the recession.  

The Donate project allows visitors to give money in seconds if they are feeling inspired to support a show or exhibition.

Loss of government grants in the current 
austerity measures mean that cultural institutions like the
Science Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London are now anxious to find other forms of 
public funding.

National treasure: Sir Arthur Stockdale Cope's Naval Officers of World War I from 1921 which is in need of costly restoration so that a new generation of art lovers can see it

Donations go directly 
to specific art works and projects, such as the National Portrait Gallery's
Naval Officers of World War I by Sir Arthur Stockdale Cope.

The 17-foot wide painting has not been shown in public since the 1960s because it is in such need of expensive cleaning and repair work.

The gallery is hoping to show the portrait in time for the 100th anniversary of the start of the First World War. 

Paul Moorhouse, the gallery's 20th 
Century Curator explained: 'Sadly, it has not been seen in decades.

'With
the necessary funds for conservation, the return of this great work in 
2014 would be very appropriate and hugely significant.'

Seeking help: The Victoria and Albert Museum, which is currently hosting a David Bowie exhibition, is one of the museums hoping for donations from the public

The painting was one of three commissioned by financier Sir Abraham Bailey to commemorate the end of the war. 

The other two, Sir James Guthrie’s Statesmen of World War I and John Singer Sargent’s General Officers of World War I, are currently on display without the third in the set.  

Eleven cultural organisations have signed up for the fundraising drive, including the Octagon theatre in Bolton, the Almeida Theatre in London and the Baltic in Gateshead, for a six month pilot.

London's Southbank Centre has chosen its appeal to be the £2.3 million restoration of the pipe organ at the Royal Festival Hall.

Research commissioned by the scheme found that people are most likely to
donate money when they are at an exhibition or performance.

Comedian Griff Rhys-Jones, who is enthusiastic about getting the public more engaged with the arts, said: 'The idea that you are standing in front of something and 
can just step forward and donate is really important.'

Culturally significant: Ronni Ancona as Beline and Henry Goodman as Argan in Moliere's The Hypochondriac at the Almeida Theatre, which is one of the 11 organisations signed up for the pilot

Expensive restoration: The Royal Festival Hall is hoping to inspire the public to give generously for refurbishment to its pipe organ

Robert
Dufton, interim chairman of the National Funding Scheme, said the 
scheme was to 'engage supporters at the point of emotional engagement 
and encourage giving.'

Mr Dufton explained: 'Many arts institutions are struggling. They are not recession proof - our research has showed that 36 per cent don’t have enough funding to meet their main objectives.

Culture Secretary Maria Miller last year told arts organisations that they needed to 'get better at asking, not just receiving'.

The scheme will be rolled out to all arts and heritage charities nationwide by the end of the year.
