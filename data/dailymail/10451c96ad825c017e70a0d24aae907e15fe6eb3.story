Held: Neville Thurlbeck, pictured arriving at the Leveson Inquiry in December, had been arrested on suspicion of witness intimidation

Former News of the World chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck will not be prosecuted over allegations of intimidating a witness in Scotland Yard's phone-hacking inquiry.

Thurlbeck, 50, will not be charged after four files relating to the investigation were handed over by detectives.

Allegations of harassment and witness intimidation related to a blog posted by Mr Thurlbeck, who remains on bail in relation to voicemail interception allegations.

He said today: 'I am pleased that the CPS has advised the police that no further action should be taken with regard to an allegation concerning one of my blog postings on nevillethurlbeck.com.

'I would like to thank my family, friends and colleagues in the industry for their unswerving loyalty, support and continued belief in me.

'And my lawyer Henri Brandman for his wise counsel. I am fortunate to retain the services of one of London's finest lawyers.'

Mr Thurlbeck wrote the blog on March 7, criticising executive Will Lewis, who is on News Corporation's Management and Standards Committee, and giving Mr Lewis' address in North London and naming the security firm protecting his home.

The road name - which can be found on the publicly available electoral roll - was subsequently removed from the post.

Alison Levitt QC, the top legal adviser to the Director of Public Prosecutions, said the Crown Prosecution Service confirmed one of the four files referred to Mr Thurlbeck.

She said: 'Having applied the full test set out in the code for Crown prosecutors the CPS has concluded that no prosecution should take place.

'Given that the journalist in question remains on bail for further offences we do not intend to give any further information at this point.

'Mr Thurlbeck remains on police bail on suspicion of offences under Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000.'

Lawyers for Mr Lewis had threatened an injunction, accusing Thurlbeck of carrying out surveillance on his home, invading his privacy and publishing libels about him.

His lawyers also claimed the reporter had libelled News Corporation's Management and Standards Committee, formed to clean up the company – which published the now defunct Sunday tabloid – following the hacking revelations.

As a key member of the MSC, Mr Lewis has become a central figure in a civil war in Rupert Murdoch's empire.

The committee's co-operation with 
Scotland Yard has caused fury among journalists after internal emails 
and details of suspected illegal activity were handed to detectives, 
which resulted in the arrests of several reporters and senior executives
from The Sun.

Thurlbeck was one of the first suspects questioned by detectives from the Yard's hacking probe, Operation Weeting, last April.

Last month he was arrested by police 
on suspicion of witness intimidation after turning up for a pre-arranged
appointment at a central London police station.

Writing after he was bailed, Thurlbeck said the events 'really didn't feel like England'.

He wrote: 'Clearly, my blog has upset someone.

'So much so, one minute I was sitting 
penning a new post. The next, I was in the police station, having DNA 
mouth swabs and my fingerprints and police mugshot taken.

'A complaint had been made and acted upon very swiftly indeed.

'It really didn't feel like England today.'

After thanking his lawyer, family and friends, he said he vigorously denied the allegations of any wrongdoing.

Mr Thurlbeck was arrested the day 
after former Sun editor Rebekah Brooks, her husband Charlie, and four 
other suspects were arrested over allegations of cover-ups surrounding 
the phone-hacking inquiry.

Thurlbeck has said detectives asked him to become a prosecution witness after seizing documents from his home.

Evidence taken from his property after
his first arrest last April indicated that he warned senior colleagues 
two years ago about hacking, he said.

Thurlbeck said detectives hoped he would become a key witness in return for potential immunity from prosecution.

But he said he had turned down the offer.

He said in November: 'I have informed 
Scotland Yard that while I fully understand and respect the reason for 
their request of me to give evidence for the Crown in any prosecution 
arising from Operation Weeting, it is my opinion that a detailed and 
forensic inquiry into my working methods by what is a highly 
professional police unit will fully exonerate me.

'So, on that basis, I have declined their offer.'

Sunderland-born Mr Thurlbeck was 
behind stories including disclosures about ex-Formula 1 boss Max 
Mosley's sex life and allegations that David Beckham had an affair. He 
has previously lodged a claim for unfair dismissal against News 
International.
