Victims: Brooklyn Beatty, left, and Ryeley Beatty, right, died over the weekend after a dresser reportedly fell on top of themÂ 

Deadly: Authorities were seen removing the dresser at the scene

Ryeley Beatty was taken there Friday after the dresser fell on her and her 2-year-old sister, Brooklyn, at their Aliquippa home in western Pennsylvania.

'The girls appeared to have been playing in or around the bottom drawer of the dresser,' causing it to fall onto them, the paper reported.

Joseph Sheppard, who lives in the same neighborhood as the victims, told CBSPittsburgh their father 'said he was running bath water and he heard a boom. And he ran in there and I guess he lifted [the dresser up and brought the girls] outside.'

'I heard their father screaming, yelling,' the girls' next-door aunt Rebecca Beatty told WPXI. 'I rushed over and because I'm a nurse, and I started CPR on them right away [...] so it's terrible.'

Authorities were seen lifting the dresser out of the family's home.

Prosecutors say  Brooklyn and Ryeley Beatty died after a dresser fell on top of them

Brooklyn was pronounced dead Friday at a Brighton hospital.

Brooklyn died of asphyxiation due to compression of her chest.

An autopsy on Ryeley is planned.

'Everybody who worked that scene... we were trying to console each other and the mom and dad,' Aliquippa Mayor Dwan Walker told the Tribune-Review. 'I talked to [the girls' grandfather]...to tell him the whole city was with him.'

A vigil is expected to take place for the girls, Walker said.

A GoFundMe page has been set up to help cover the Beatty family's expenses.
