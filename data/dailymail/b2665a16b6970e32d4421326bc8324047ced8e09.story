With £6million in his back pocket, you'd think Stephen Hester would be able to afford the finest home furnishings money can buy.

So it's a bit of a surprise that the 52-year-old former chief executive of RBS has been making trips to budget furniture store Ikea.

The banker has been spotted carrying his belongings
 in one of the chain's distinctive bright blue bags while on holiday in 
the south of France with his wife Suzy Neubert.

He received the seven-figure sum - 
enough to buy a million £6 Lack tables from the popular Swedish store - 
as a golden goodbye from the bank, which is 81 per cent owned by the 
taxpayer after a £45billion bailout.

The keen huntsman is on a golfing holiday at the £1,000-a-night Royal Mougins resort near Cannes after leaving the bank last week.

This cost-conscious choice of shop is especially surprising considering he enjoyed an annual salary of about £1.2million while heading the bank, as well as long-term incentives linked to shares.

He owns a 350-acre estate in Oxfordshire and a ski chalet in Verbier, Switzerland - hardly the ideal setting for a £20 MDF side table.

He was brought in to run the bank after the Treasury was forced to bail out RBS during the financial crisis five years ago, but Chancellor George Osborne believes he is not the right person to guide the bank through privatisation.

Speculation has been rife that Mr Hester’s departure from RBS reflected a split with Mr Osbourne over 
the timing or structure of privatisation or perhaps a concern that the 
Government was about to revive plans to break up RBS into a 'good' bank 
and a 'bad' bank.

However, he insists there has 
been no falling out and claimed he did not feel any anger over the manner of his departure, adding: ‘I don’t want to show frustration, I don’t want to punch someone in the eye.

‘I haven’t hidden from anyone that I am torn a bit at this juncture.

‘Part of me did want to see the job fully through, did want the champagne and roses of a successful privatisation. Another part of me thought, “Goodness me, this job drives me nuts from time to time and how long do I want to do it for?”.'

He added: 'I genuinely mean I am comfortable 
with what has happened. RBS is in much better shape than we had any 
right to think it could be. I want the company to have a good future and
 I want to pass the baton on smoothly and without rancour or difficulty.
 I am happy with this result.’

More than £1billion was wiped off the
 value of the Government's stake in Royal Bank of Scotland in the wake 
of the dramatic departure last week.

Replacing him is expected to 
take at least six months, with Mr Osborne reportedly sharing the RBS 
board’s view that the next chief executive must be prepared to stay on 
for at least five years.

Mr Hester split from his first wife in 2010 and is now married to Mrs Neubert, a wealth manager.

Cannes, on the French Riviera, appears to be a popular location for former RBS chiefs.

despite the bank's failures, has a villa in the prosperous French city.

Stephen Hester was named the new chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland in October 2008 as Sir Fred Goodwin was ousted and the Labour Government made the first of two massive capital injections that eventually totalled £45billion to shore up the collapsing bank.

Hester joined RBS from property giant British Land where he had been chief executive, but he was a banker through and through.

A comprehensive education in Yorkshire took him to Oxford where he took a first in Philosophy, Politics and Economics.

He then began a career in investment banking at Credit Suisse. It was here, between 1982 and 2001, that he laid the foundations of his personal wealth and met his first wife, Canadian-born Barbara Abt.

Hester came to prominence in British retail banking from 2002 when he joined Abbey National, first as finance director and later as chief operating officer working alongside chief executive Luqman Arnold.

Abbey had run into difficulties because of an expansion into wholesale banking which had backfired and lumbered the bank with toxic assets and spiralling losses. Arnold and Hester stabilised the bank and in 2004 sold it to Spanish giant Santander.

After taking over at RBS, Hester oversaw a major shrinking of the bank’s assets, tackled the Libor scandal and suffered repeated public and political attacks over his bonuses, most of which he has been forced to waive.
