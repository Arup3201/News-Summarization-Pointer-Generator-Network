Brazil star Neymar put his World Cup injury nightmare behind him by appearing to accept an apology from Colombia's Juan Zuniga - the man who played a part in his premature end to the tournament.

Neymar, who captained Brazil for the first time since being handed the captain's armband by national team boss Dunga, embraced Zuniga before his side's 1-0 win over Colombia at the Sun Life Stadium in Miami.

The Barcelona ace was ruled out of the remaining games of the World Cup - held in his native Brazil - following a clash with Napoli defender Zuniga during the quarter-final stage.

Injury nightmare: Neymar was carried off on a stretcher during Brazil's narrow World Cup win over Colombia

Neymar had to be carried off on a stretcher after Zuniga's reckless challenge left the 22-year-old with a fractured vertebrae.

Brazil eliminated their fellow South Americans from the prestigious tournament but were then thrashed 7-1 by eventual winners Germany.

The outcome of Brazil's tournament could have been remarkably different if Neymar had managed to stay fit for the remainder of the tournament, however the former Santos forward has refused to hold a grudge against Zuniga.
