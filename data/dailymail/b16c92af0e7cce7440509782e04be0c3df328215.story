A new treatment could bring hope to thousands of shingles sufferers with long-term pain.

Trials of the experimental drug EMA401 found it cut pain levels by at least 30 per cent for more than half of sufferers - some of whom had been in agony for years.

Pain relief was experienced after just four weeks of taking two pills a day, according to a study published in The Lancet medical journal.

British researchers behind the study hope the breakthrough will benefit patients with post-shingles pain, and many more with other intractable pain conditions.

Because the drug works in a different way to conventional painkillers, it may be able to treat chronic nerve pain from diabetes, HIV, nerve injury and cancer chemotherapy.

Shingles is caused by reactivation of the virus that causes chickenpox and affects 190,000 Britons each year, most of them aged over 50.

After a case of chickenpox the virus is not eliminated but retreats to clusters of sensory nerve cells, usually near the spinal cord, where it remains in a dormant state.

But, as immunity weakens with age or as a result of stress, the virus can reactivate, leading to a painful rash.

For one in 10 patients, the permanent nerve damage caused by the virus results in post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), the medical term for post-shingles pain.

This can be severely debilitating, causing burning, throbbing and stabbing pain which is difficult to treat.

Conventional painkilling agents often fail to work, and can have unpleasant or disabling side effects.

The study involved 183 patients aged 22-89 years in six countries who had had PHN for at least six months.

The study compared EMA401 with a placebo or dummy treatment, with participants taking two pills a day for four weeks.

Altogether 58 per cent of participants taking the drug found it effective, reducing pain by at least 30 per cent by blocking pain pathways in a novel way.

It did not cause any serious side effects.

Study leader Professor Andrew Rice, from the Department of Surgery and Cancer at Imperial College London, said ‘Conventional painkillers don’t tend to help people with severe chronic neuropathic pain and most available treatments have modest efficacy and/or are limited by side effects.

‘We are therefore keen to find new ways of providing these people with some relief.

‘A positive trial like this in such a challenging condition as post-herpetic neuralgia, for a drug that acts in a new way, is unusual and very exciting.

‘We hope that the new drug will ultimately offer hope for patients who aren’t helped by current treatments.’ 

Prof Rice said neuropathic was caused by hyper-excitability of the nerves.

He said ‘The drug is probably blocking the hyper-excitability associated with nerve damage.’ He said it would be taken long-term by patients, in the same way that arthritis patients need regular medication. 

Marian Nicholson from the Shingles Support Society said ‘This is a positive development and we very much welcome it. Research carried out so far seems to indicate that the treatment is safe, so we hope that new trials with higher doses can make it even more effective.’

She added ‘Shingles pain, or PHN mainly affects the elderly. It can render a patient’s final years an unendurable misery. Prompt treatment may help to prevent this, so we urge anyone who thinks they may have shingles to go to the doctor immediately.’

Spinifex Pharmaceuticals, the Australian based company which owns the drug, now plans a larger trial testing higher doses of the drug for longer periods of time.

Prof Rice said ‘We are looking forward to seeing how EMA401 performs in a larger trial in people with post-herpetic neuralgia, where we will explore higher doses, and in trials where we will analyse its efficacy in other chronic pain conditions.‘Identifying the characteristics of the patients who do get good pain relief from EMA401 will also be an important avenue for research.’

Tom McCarthy, CEO of Spinifex Pharmaceuticals, said ‘There is a clear need for new treatments that bring patients pain relief with fewer side effects.

‘In addition to post-herpetic neuralgia, we see broad potential for EMA401 to treat a range of chronic painful conditions such as pain due to osteoarthritis and diabetes.’

Since September certain older people qualify for one-off vaccination against shingles on the NHS - those aged 70 or 79.

Research last month found having shingles puts you at higher risk of having a stroke or heart attack years later, particularly when the attack occurs before the age of 40.
