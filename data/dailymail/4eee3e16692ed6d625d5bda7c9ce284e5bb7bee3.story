There have been numerous drinking games invented over the years - but drinking a pint of beer through the ear has got to be one of the most challenging.

But a young female drinker has apparently achieved the astonishing feat in this video posted on the Czech Beer Festival's Facebook page.

The woman, wearing a green cardigan with matching scarf, can be seen placing a bendy straw into her left ear as her friends gather around her.

Ready for the challenge: A Czech girl attempts to down a beer through her ear in this video posted on the Czech Beer Festival's Facebook page

Quite a drinker: The video shows the young woman apparently sucking up the beer through her ear

Ouch: The mystery woman's expressions suggest that ear drinking isn't a pleasant experience

But deciding she may have better luck with her right ear, she removes her earring before placing the straw in that ear instead.

The end of the straw is placed in a pint of beer and the drinker appears to suck the booze through her ear in this bizarre video which lasts just one minute and 53 seconds.

A helping hand: A friend holds the pint glass as the female starts to struggle with the challenge

Her friends appear to be torn between amazement and disgust as the beer level starts to lower

Moral support: But her friends start to cheer her on as she nearly finishes the complete pint of beer

And judging from her facial expressions, it apparently isn't a very pleasant experience.

The pint of beer gradually empties until it is finally all gone and the young female is greeted with a round of applause.

It is thought the video is a fake, especially as the beer can't be seen in certain camera shots, but it is still unclear how the ruse of the emptying beer glass was created.Â

Quite a stunt: The Czech girl happily accepts applause for the unusual feat at the end of the video

In theory, as the ears' Eustachian tubes connects them to the throat, it could be possible to consume liquid into the stomach through the ear.

But the Eustachian tube is incredibly narrow which makes it highly unlikely that an entire pint of liquid could get down it.

A high amount of pressure would be required to push all the beer through the Eustachian tube.

An expert, who didn't wish to be named, also said anyone who managed to do this would have to have a hole in their ear drum or no ear drum at all.

Trying this stunt at home is not advisable as fluid trapped in the Eaustachian tubes can lead to ear infections and the potential damage to ear drums could cause a loss of hearing.
