During the group stages of this year’s World Cup, a record 136 goals were scored – leading to more than one billion Facebook posts and comments. 

Data scientists from the social network analysed these posts to study the use of the word ‘goal’, and to see how people were stretching out the term, such as ‘gooooal’.

They discovered that users in Venezuela were the most vocal, with an average 21 characters per goal post, but among teams in the competition, Mexico fans have added the most letters with 12.8.

Facebook studied the use of the word 'goal' on the site. Users in Venezuela top the list with an average of 21 characters, but among teams that have played in this year's tournament, Mexico fans (pictured) have been the most enthusiastic including, on average, 12.8 characters in their 'goal' posts

Users in Venezuela have been the most 
vocal throughout the competition, with an average 21 characters.

But, among teams in the 
competition:

1. Mexico: Fans add an extra 6.63 characters on average, per post.

2. Algeria: 6.01

3. Uruguay: 5.77

4. Brazil: 5.43

5. Colombia: 5.3

6. Ecuador: 5.27

7. France: 4.81

8. Honduras: 3.88

9. Costa Rica: 3.87

10: Argentina: 3.84

Meanwhile Iran and Nigeria were at the
 bottom of the list adding only 0.18 and 0.39 extra letters 
respectively.

Unsurprisingly, the fans of teams that scored more goals were more vocal, and it may be that Iranian fans had little to shout about.

The longest exuberant mention of the word ‘goal,’ in any language, came from Argentina in celebration of Lionel Messi’s free-kick goal against Nigeria on June 25. 

That particular mention of ‘gol’ contained 20,400 letter ‘o’s. 

Facebook’s data team explained that if someone was to hold down the ‘o’ key on a keyboard for that amount of characters, it would take roughly 12 minutes to type. 

Due to the language differences, the researchers compared the relative number of extra characters within each version of the word goal, including ‘gol’ and ‘tor’. 

They found that only in Spanish, Portuguese, English, and German do people significantly use redundant characters in exuberant posts.

That mention of 'gol' contained 20,400 occurrences of the letter 'o', which would have taken approximately 12 minutes to type

1. Iran: 0.18 extra characters

2. Nigeria: 0.39

3. UK: 0.42

4. Croatia: 0.53

5. Australia: 0.63

6. Portugal: 0.75

7. Cameroon: 0.8

8. Italy: 0.88

9. Bosnia and Herzegovina: 0.95

10. South Korea: 1.2

The top five countries were Venezuela (21.2 characters), Gabon (18.4), Tunisia (13.4), Mexico (12.8) and Montenegro (12.8).

However, if the data is only taken for teams in the competition, Algeria was second with 6.01 extra letters, Uruguay was third with 5.77 and Brazil was fourth with 5.43. 

The top five most prevalent translations and spellings in posts and comments about goals included 'gol', in Spanish, Brazilian and Portuguese, 'goal' in English, 'ประตู' in Thai, 'tor' in German and 'ゴール' in Japanese.

People on Facebook tended to post these exuberant mentions right after key moments in matches. 

In particular, goals scored by Neymar Jr. from Brazil consistently garner a high number of exuberant mentions.

The
 top group stage goal on Facebook was when Javier ‘Chicharito’ Hernández
 secured Mexico's win over Croatia with a goal to make it 3-0 on 23 
June.

Facebook has also created a map showing how popular the tournament's top players are, around the world. This image shows Messi's popularity. The darker the green, the higher the mentions and popularity. Other players include England's Wayne Rooney and Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo
