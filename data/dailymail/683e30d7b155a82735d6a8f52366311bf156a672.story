They're already deemed to be among the most famous, respected and talented celebrities of today.

And now, David Beckham, Rita Ora, Pharrell Williams and Damian Lillard have officially been recognised as the world's biggest superstars after being snapped up to front adidas' latest footwear campaign.

To relaunch the brand's Superstar shoe, adidas Originals launched a global campaign questioning what it means to be a superstar in 2015 and  hand-picked the lucky foursome.  

David Beckham joins Rita Ora, Damian Lillard and Pharrell to re-launch Adidas' superstar show. The foursome were hand-picked as the world's biggest superstars, say the brand

The footballer, singer, music mogul and basketball legend star in a 90-second film, directed by Karum Huu Do, and each reveal what they deem to be 'a superstar'. 

The video opens with Rita Ora taking to the stage at her concert. She says: 'If you think a superstar is standing on stage, filling up stadiums and selling out concert halls...'

The film then switches to Damian, 39, being photographed by the paparazzi and playing basketball and saying: 'If you think a superstar is about being spoken about, staying relevant...'

Next, David appears and adds: 'If you think a superstar is keeping fans happy...'

Rita, 23, who is known for her party lifestyle and regularly appears on best - and worst - dressed lists, goes on: 'If you think a superstar is people wanting to know where you are, who you're with, reading about what you had for breakfast, or caring about what you wear at what event...'

To relaunch the brand's Superstar shoe, adidas Originals launched a global campaign starring the likes of David Beckham

They then all chime in together and say: 'If you think a superstar is having a stylist, security, being unpredictable, being the face, the name, the signature with people on the street, people in other countries, people you'll never meet, telling you that you're special...'

Before Pharrell closes the video and concludes: 'If you think that's what makes a superstar, then I am not a superstar.'

The brand are keen to go big with their A-list campaign; the film will be accompanied by six shorter edits, including a 30-second version to launch Pharrell’s forthcoming Supercolor collection. 

Takeovers in Times Square and Madison Square Garden in New York,  and product drops, including further collaborations with Pharrell and Rita Ora, will follow.
