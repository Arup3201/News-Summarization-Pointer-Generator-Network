The future of the BBC licence fee has been thrown into doubt as it emerged that less than half of Britons think that it is good value for money.

New figures reveal that just 44 per cent of viewers think that the £145.50 annual charge is the best way to fund the public broadcaster, with others supporting advertising or voluntary subscriptions. 

The findings come after it was found that a dwindling number of television sets in Britain and a growing number of online-TV viewers could also threatening the future of the licence fee.

The latest poll, conducted by YouGov for the Times, found that there had been a 4 per cent drop in the number of viewers who thought the licence fee was good value for money. 

Though the licence fee is the favoured single method as a means to support the Corporation, 45 per cent would prefer an alternative means of funding.

Of those, 25 per cent would support the introduction of advertising as a form of revenue, while 13 per cent thought voluntary subscriptions would be effective. 

A combination of the two alternative methods garnered just 7 per cent of the votes. And 11 per cent of respondents said that they did not know how the Corporation should be funded. 

It comes after it emerged last month that children watch half the amount of TV as their parents.

Youngsters between the age of 11 and 15 spend six times longer watching internet video clips as older viewers, but spend much less time in front of traditional sets, an Ofcom survey found.

Because the licence fee only applies to those who watch or record TV and not to those who watch up catch-up shows or other internet content, many future adults may be exempt. 

The problem is compounded by the fact that there are also fewer television sets in the UK for the first time ever.

In the report published this month, Ofcom highlighted BBC figures revealing that in July this year, 47 per cent of people accessing iPlayer were doing so through tablets or mobiles, an increase from just 25 per cent in October 2012.

The report said there are now approximately 900,000 households with access to the internet but no television set and so rely on internet services to watch programmes. On average, people in the UK watch four hours of television a day, with ‘linear viewing’ – meaning watching show at the time when it is broadcast – still being the most popular way of consuming television. 

Although the level of television viewing dropped by 4 per cent in 2013, Ofcom has said it is ‘not yet clear whether this was the beginning of a longer-term trend or merely a temporary variation.’  

The BBC told MailOnline: 'At just £2.80 a week per household the BBC provides excellent value for money. It means that programmes like EastEnders, Strictly, Sherlock, Doctor Who and Match of the Day can be watched by everyone, not a select few, along with our radio stations, news, iPlayer and our website.

'Public support for the licence fee has risen since 2004 and remains the most popular way of funding the BBC - indeed, another YouGov poll for The Times earlier in December showed 51% support for the licence fee.'
