Charged: Katrina Marie Culberson, 20, was charged with kidnapping and aggravated arson in the death of Celeste Fronsman, 29

A 20-year-old woman was today charged with the kidnapping, arson, and gruesome death of a 29-year-old woman who police said lived only five miles apart.

In addition to aggravated murder, 20-year-old Katrina Marie Culberson of Canton, Ohio was charged with kidnapping and aggravated arson in the death of 29-year-old Celeste Fronsman, according to the Muskingum County Sheriff's Office.

Fronsman was found by a truck driver on a remote strip of a central Ohio road, naked and screaming in horror that someone was trying to kill her. There was also a strap around her neck.

The sheriff acknowledged the two women were connected, but would not elaborate.

After the driver called 911, she was flown by emergency helicopter to Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus, but died two days later.

Dr Jan Gorniak, the Franklin County coroner, ruled the death a homicide but said it will take four to six weeks before the exact cause of death can be determined because of extensive second-, third- and fourth-degree burns.

Horrific end: Celeste Fronsman, pictured after two separate arrests, was found by an unnamed truck driver naked and covered in burns

The burns covered more than 80 per cent of her body, the coroner said.

Muskingum
County Sheriff Matt Lutz told the Associated Press that Culberson was 
arrested Wednesday and that detectives have interviewed her, although he
declined to discuss the contents of their talk.

Criminal record: Fronsman had more than 20 previous arrests, many of them for prostitution and cocaine charges

Lutz also declined to say what 
detectives believe was the motive or whether anyone else participated in
the killing, saying only that 'there are other people of interest that 
investigators are trying to contact.'

'We're going to do everything we can do to prosecute all the people involved in it,' said Lutz, who has called Fronsman's killing 'one of the most gruesome things I've ever seen in 23 1/2 years in law enforcement.'

He also has said investigators believe that whoever killed Fronsman knew her. 'This was not a random thing,' he said.

Culberson has been arrested at least six times in the last two years on charges that include soliciting for prostitution, theft and burglary, court records show.

In the prostitution case, Culberson pleaded no contest and was sentenced to two months in jail.

She was found guilty on the burglary charge, while the theft charge against her is pending.

Online records show that Culberson lived about five miles away from Fronsman in Canton. No phone number was listed for her.

Court records also show that Fronsman was involved in prostitution and was living a dangerous life, having had dozens of brushes with the law since 2003.

In less than 10 years, Fronsman was arrested more than 20 times on charges mostly involving domestic violence, cocaine possession and prostitution, records in Canton and Stark County courts show.

In all, Fronsman was arrested and convicted of soliciting for prostitution six times since 2005, most recently in March.

Her most recent arrest occurred on May 28 for having drug paraphernalia.

Her sister, Sarah Gulosh, told the Zanesville Times Recorder that despite her trouble with the law, Fronsman was a loving mother and a good sister and never failed to tell her grandparents how much she loved them.

'This is one of the most gruesome things I've ever seen in 23 1/2 years in law enforcement. This was not a random thing.'

'She was a good person,' she said, adding that Fronsman had a heart of gold.

Gulosh said her sister was left tortured by the death of her 2-year-old daughter, Jordyn, in 2005, and the death of her mother in 2009.

'We always told her she needed to stop what she was doing and ask God for forgiveness,' Gulosh said. 'But she loved God, and she told us she had asked him for forgiveness.'

Her father told the Columbus Dispatch that he last saw his daughter when she and a friend borrowed his truck, promising to return shortly.

The father, whose name has not been released, said that he contacted authorities that morning.

'This is a vicious animal,' he said of the murderer at large, adding: 'They ought to be taken off the street and put away.'

Evidence: Empty gasoline containers were removed from the scene by investigators

Not a random act: Sheriff Matt Lutz said the crime was the most gruesome he had seen in his career, and that the two women knew each other

The sheriff agreed, and the investigation continues as crime scene examiners were seen removing empty gas containers from the dumpsite.

'This is one of the most gruesome things I have ever seen in 23 and a half years in law enforcement,' Mr Lutz said.

'I can't imagine the pain that this lady went through.'
