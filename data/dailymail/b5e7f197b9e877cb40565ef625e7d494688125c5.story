Waiting lists for potentially tests which can detect cancer have doubled in a year and are at a six year high, new figures show.

Crucial procedures such as colonoscopy - used to detect bowel and stomach cancers - and MRI and CT scans used to find tumours, are supposed to be undertaken within six weeks of a GP referral. 

But the latest figures show in May this year alone more than 18,000 patients waited longer than that - more than double the number at this point last year.

It is five times higher than the number of patients forced to wait longer than six weeks back in 2010.

Experts said the delays - which are partly blamed on rising number of patients and the ageing population - would alarm those potentially at risk.   Yesterday Mark Flannagan, Chief Executive of the charity Beating Bowel Cancer, said the delays were ‘unacceptable’ given the huge risks of late diagnosis. 

He said: ‘When cancers are diagnosed early they are treatable and outcomes improve significantly. With bowel cancer more than 90pc of people diagnosed at an early stage survive for at least five years compared to less than 7pc of those diagnosed at a late stage.

‘The period between being told you may have cancer and finding out whether you have or not is an extraordinarily worrying time for patients. To wait any time for a diagnosis is hard enough but to wait for more than 6 weeks is not something anyone should be expected to go through.

'These waiting times must be improved in order to ensure that patients’ health and well-being is paramount.’

The figures from NHS England show 18,664 people waited longer than six weeks for diagnostic tests in May 2014, compared with 6,899 in May 2013, and 3,495 in May 2010.

These tests can detect life-threatening illnesses such as cancer and heart disease at an early stage and save lives.

In just one month 3,870 patients waited over six weeks for tests for bowel and stomach cancers such as colonoscopy, cystoscopy – a telescope into the bladder - and gastroscopy, 1,611 waited too long for a CT scan, 6,839 for an ultrasound not related to pregnancy, up from just 1,181 last year, and 1,960 saw delays for an MRI scan.

Andy Burnham MP, Labour’s Shadow Health Secretary (pls keep) who unearthed the figures, said: ‘Patients are waiting longer for crucial tests – causing stress and real anguish for worried families. 

‘Last month, the NHS missed the cancer treatment target for the first time ever and these delays have clearly played a part in that. All the progress made on cancer care in the last decade is now at risk.’ 

Duleep Allirajah, of Macmillan Cancer Support, said it was ‘alarming’ that the proportion of people who face delays in receiving vital tests which can diagnose cancer has doubled since this time last year.

He said: ‘The NHS is under strain and cancer risks being overlooked and not given the focus it needs.  Each individual hospital has a responsibility to meet these targets, or they risk putting a patient’s best chance of survival at risk.’

The Department of Health say only 2.3pc of people wait more than six weeks. The NHS is carrying out an extra 10,000 diagnostic tests a day – or 350,000 a month -  compared with 2010.

It is understood five trusts are responsible for 25pc of all the overlong waiting times – Royal Berkshire Foundation Trust, Croydon Health Services NHS Trust, North Cumbria University Hospitals, Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust and Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust.

A spokesperson said: ‘We know parts of the NHS are under pressure because of unprecedented demand – the service is performing nearly 10,000 extra tests every day compared to 2009/10, and there are recovery plans in place to deal with any local dips in performance.

‘We’re also providing extra support for more operations, doctors, nurses and beds, and  investing £750 million to support early diagnosis of cancer and better access to treatment.’
