You've witnessed the Duchess effect, we've all seen the Cara effect, now it's time for the Yotam Ottolenghi effect.

The Israeli-born chef, restauranteur and cookery writer has been hailed as one of the reasons Middle Eastern food is having such a popularity boom in the UK, with sales of many ingredients previously thought of as 'exotic' now stacked high on local supermarket shelves around the country.

Dips such as homous and baba ganoush, herbs, spices and flavourings like sumac and harissa, and even preserved lemons have become shopping trolley staples, according to figures from supermarket giant Waitrose.

Preserved lemons, used in many Middle Eastern dishes has seen a rise in sales of 72 per cent since this time last year, and sales of harissa, the spicy sauce, have boomed by 62 per cent. Even Tahini, a key ingredient for making your own houmous, has risen by nearly 40 per cent

Sumac, a traditional spice with a tart flavour, has been on Waitrose shelves for 11 years, but over the last year, sales have grown 23 per cent.

Ottolenghi: 'I knew something was achieved when I recently spotted sumac in the spice section of my local Waitrose.'

Houmous is now so popular there are more than 10 own label variants in and it is one of the best sellers in the delicatessen department. Even sales of tahini sesame paste, a key ingredient for making your own houmous, has risen by nearly 40 per cent.

Preserved lemons, often added to Middle Eastern dishes, have seen a 72 per cent rise in sales since this time last year, and sales of other Arabian spices have been booming

Waitrose now stock 10 varieties of own-label homous, plus myriad other brands of the crushed chickpea dip

Similarly, recent sales figures saw fresh appetisers up 30 per cent and fresh dips up 23 per cent.

According to Victoria Mason from Waitrose: 'We're seeing a big trend in Middle Eastern foods as chefs like Ottolenghi are helping to drive this with his books, restaurants and TV programmes.

'Middle Eastern cuisine like Mediterranean food is a healthy yet tasty option which is attractive to mums trying to tantalise the taste buds of the family while giving them something that's good for them too.'
