As a young boy he watched as his mother  scoured newspapers for coupons to buy milk and bread to feed her family.

But now, as one of the richest people in Britain and worth an estimated £60m, Mark Pearson said his poor upbringing inspired his success.

Mr Pearson said watching his mother Julie cut out coupons as she struggled to pay for her young family inspired him to set up a discount site My Voucher Codes. 

He has been able to use his success to buy his mother a house, and now owns property in the Caribbean and a fleet of luxury cars.  

The entrepreneur was inspired by his upbringing, where his mother (pictured) collected vouchers to feed them

He describes his upbringing in Liverpool as a difficult one.

On Christmas Day in 1992, when he was just nine, his mother took he and his younger sister to a women's refuge after a violent encounter with the man in her life.

Mr Pearson's mother was left working several jobs to pay for her young family - a world away from his life now which he splits between properties in Britain and the Caribbean, complete with a fleet of luxury cars,

'Growing up in Huyton in Liverpool, I had a challenging upbringing,' said the 34-year-old. 

Eight years after launching his voucher discount company Mark Pearson is a millionaire worth around £60m 

'Times were very tight.

'My mum was juggling single parenthood with working several, low-paid jobs.

'I remember we had to stay with my nan often because my mum worked a lot of jobs to make ends meet, including working nights in a petrol station.

'My mum had trouble making ends meet.

'It was hard for her financially, emotionally and socially. My nan saved vouchers on her fridge and watched every penny.

'I remember watching my mum scour the papers looking for coupons to cut out so we she could buy us milk and bread.' 

Mr Pearson said that after him and his mother ended up in the refuge he felt he should become a breadwinner, which drove him to achieve his success. 

He added: 'I felt that I was now the only man in the family, and that drove me.

'At nine or 10 I couldn't do anything, but over time I kept thinking, 'how could I be the breadwinner?'

'It all ignited a spark in me to do something, to be the breadwinner.'

 When he was 18, Mr Pearson moved to London to pursue a career as a chef and worked under Gordon Ramsay after being taken on as an apprentice at Claridges.

After working in various restaurants in London and setting up a floristry business he launched the My Voucher Codes in November 2006 aged 27 after paying just £300 for the website.

He started his business in humble surroundings - from a laptop in a one-bedroom flat in Croydon in 2006. 

He spent hours scouring news websites and magazines for vouchers from companies which he posted on his website.

Soon he was able to secure payment from the companies using 'affiliate marketing' whereby he would receive a commission fee each time someone downloaded the voucher.

In the first 12 months of trading he saw the website turnover £300,000.

Incredibly, in just four years the business earned an astonishing £10million and in 2011 he received the Ernst and Young 'Emerging Entrepreneur of the Year'.

Eight years on from the launch he is a millionaire.

The site, which receives more than a million hits each week, was so successful InterFlora and Flowers Direct, asked if he could advertise their vouchers.

My VoucherCodes is a website which offers people deals on restaurants, bars, clothes and gifts 

It works by allowing customers to select offers advertised on the site 

They are then given a code, which can be used at online checkouts for specific stores so they can claim offers 

The former chef is now a multi-millionaire

In eight years it has grown to be used by millions of people

Monetise bought the company for £55m in June - eight years after it was launched 

He said: 'I was thinking this is a neat business model.

'Unlike roses, I was suddenly selling something that didn't cost me anything to buy..

When he made his first million, Mr Pearson bought mum Julie her own house in Liverpool and one for himself and his partner, Arron Harpin, 25, and their two surrogate twin boys.

He added: 'One of the things I was most proud of was my agenda – to give something back to my mum.

'One of my biggest purchases was to give my mum a house. The look on her face was indescribable. I think at that point I felt I had made it.

'I bought a place in Barbados three years ago.

'I just thought 'imagine you are running your business on a Caribbean beach in the sun' but I have only been twice. I've just been too busy to go back.

'But mum now gets to spend six months of the year in Liverpool, and six in Barbados.

'In Christmas 2006 I went home and I remember my step-dad, who is a great guy but always quite conservative, said to me 'well, enjoy while it lasts because it won't last' when I was showing him my charts and graphs.

In June Mr Pearson pocketed tens of millions of pounds after Markco Media, the parent company of My Voucher Codes, was acquired by Monitise plc for £55million.

He is now executive vice president of the company.
