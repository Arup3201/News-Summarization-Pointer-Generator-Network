They say the customer is always right.

Well, that is unless you're a dissatisfied guest of the Georgian House in Glasgow.

After a string of critical comments were made on Trip Advisor about 'grubby rooms' and 'nasty breakfasts', a former manager of the hotel began to respond to guests - telling them that they could hardly expect better given the cheap price of the hotel.

Writing under the name of 'georgianhouse1000, Owner at The Georgian House', the unapologetic member of staff, named as Virginia Giovanni, hurled back retorts to the disgruntled customers.

A string of critical comments were made on Trip Advisor about 'grubby rooms' and 'nasty breakfasts' at the hotel

Telling them that they 'pay little, they get little' and refusing to apologise for their bad experiences, the staff member then told them to 'go the Hilton' if they wanted better food.

It is now understood that the manager has left the hotel, which charges from £29.99 a night, after being dismissed by owner Elizabeth Morris, the Daily Record reported.

One unhappy guest summarised their experience as nasty breakfast, grubby room', as they complained: 'The room, which was very small and cramped, and shower room were not cleaned during our 4 night stay, bins not emptied, glasses not washed, one towel each, not changed, no hand towels, no shampoo and the very cheapest hand wash and shower gel.

'We had to go looking for a replacement toilet roll one night as there was none in our shower room!

'The breakfast was terrible. A continental breakfast was (laughingly!!) served.'

They signed off with the comment: 'Altogether this was very disappointing, it was possibly the worst B and B accommodation I have ever stayed in. My advice would be to go elsewhere!'

The customer is not always right: The criticisms were met with withering disdain from the staff member

You pay little you get cheap: Under the owner's name, a staff member began criticising the reviewers

But Giovanni fought back with: 'If you want a good breakfast go to the hilton and pay £100.00 a night. You pay little you get little.'

One guest from Amsterdam wrote: 'Apart from the location, there is absolutely no positive remark we can make about The Georgian House.

'We do not recommend anybody to stay at The Georgian House.

'There are many other great hotels in the surroundings of The Georgian House that are better (and mostly cheaper as well)!'

But the former manager retorted: 'With only one person to look after the place what do you expect. Think about what you paid. '

One reviewer took to Trip Advisor to write: 'Nice location,with clean fresh beds (which creaked terribly if you moved) but lacking in everything else.

'Staff were not friendly, in fact we hardly saw them apart from when they showed us to our room.'

The staff member refused to accept responsibility for the complaints that guests had

Instead of apologising, the staff member retorted to criticism with asking customers not to demand so much

To which the former manager responded: 'We are a cheap hotel so what do you expect.

The current manager told Mail Online: 'That person has now left and there is a new manager. I don't know anything else about it.'

The hotel boasts that it offers a 'lovingly restored' building in an excellent location.

It says: 'If you are looking for a cheap hotel in the very best location in Glasgow you have found it!

'The building is a lovingly restored Victorian townhouse with single, double, twin and family en-suite rooms retaining many of the original architectural features.

'This welcoming hotel gives you traditional, relaxed, informal comfort in the heart of Glasgow's West End. We have 11 well presented rooms and a dining breakfast room.

'We offer first rate accomodation (sic) at excellent prices, we feel giving the best value in town in the best location in Glasgow.'
