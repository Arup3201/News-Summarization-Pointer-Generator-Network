For almost a year after Lindsey Stone was fired, she refused to leave the house. 

Her former employer, Life (Living Independently Forever) dismissed her in 2012 over a picture that a coworker had taken of her giving the finger at Arlington National Cemetery.

The firing of both women came after an ardent online campaign that had flooded Life, which works with 'pretty high-functioning people with learning difficulties,' according to Stone, with emails. 

In addition to the firing, it left a digital trail of bitter anger against Stone, including a now-unavailable Facebook page 'Fire Lindsey Stone,' which had than 19,000 Likes at one point.

Shocking: Lindsey Stone flashed the obscene gesture at Arlington National Cemetery, next to a sign that asked for respect

'I really became obsessed with reading everything about myself,' Stone told Jon Ronson for the Guardian about tracking online reactions in the days after the photo was discovered.  

Stone's coworker, who snapped the photo, didn't do anything to restrict the privacy settings on the Facebook folder it was posted in.

The photo went viral, and became a lightning rod of angry comments over the disrespect to fallen veterans that the photo represented. 

'Lindsey Stone hates the military and hates soldiers who have died in foreign wars', read one comment.

'You should rot in hell,' read another. 'Just pure Evil,' said yet another, in addition to rape and death threats, and demands that she be sent to prison.  

After the incident, Stone's father called his daughter's behavior 'disgraceful' and said the picture was a 'total lapse of judgment.'

Peter Stone insisted his daughter 'apologize to everybody' for the obscene gesture, which the 30-year-old made at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in October, next to a sign at the 
military cemetery that asked for 'Silence and Respect.'

'It was just a spur of 
the moment, total lapse of judgment,' Peter Stone told WCVB-TV. 'She wasn't reacting to the place; 
she was reacting to the sign and she apologizes to everybody.'

Stone was among eight staff members 
that traveled with the group of 40 residents to the nation's capital. 

Photos from the organization's Facebook page showed residents 
touring the White House and the Washington Monument on October 20. 

An unknown Facebook user, who claimed to be an Iraq War veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, created a page on the social networking site, 'Fire Lindsey Stone.'

The page, which was started on Monday, had the stated intent to 'only accept termination.'

Punishment: A Facebook page entitled 'Fire Lindsey Stone' has garnered over 6,000 Likes and Stone's employer said that Stone (right, in an undated photo in Times Square) has been placed on unpaid leave

As part of an experiment in reputation management services, Ronson set up Stone with the company reputation.com to rehabilitate Stone's online image.

'They call me every week, week after week,' according to Stone, and submit social media posts for her approval intended to improve the neutral pages that show up under her Google searches.

After almost a year of sending resumes to employers and receiving no response for employment, Stone says she was hired to work with autistic children. 

'But I'm terrified' of her employers finding the photo, Stone said, and feels trapped because she can't simply ask whether they've seen it and simply don't care.

'I love this job so much. I love these kids,' she told the Guardian. 'One of the parents paid me a really high compliment the other day.' 

'I’ve only been working with her son for a month and she was like, "The moment I met you, seeing the way you are with my son, and the way you treat people, you were meant to work in this field."’ 

'But what if she found out?' Stone worries. 'Would she feel the same way?'

It has affected Stone in profound ways, as the fear of being discovered worked its way into aspects of her social life.

'Since it happened, I haven’t tried to date anybody. How much do you let a new person into your life? Do they already know?' 

Justified? Stone (pictured left: with her co-worker Jamie Schuh in April) said in a statement that she posed for the picture for her own amusement (pictured right: at a work holiday party in December 2011)

Apologies: The woman's father, Peter Stone, insisted that his daughter meant no disrespect

Jim Godsil, CFO of LIFE, had called Stone's behavior 'despicable.'

'We have codes of conduct in terms of
 how we expect our employees to act, and this could potentially be in 
violation of that,' he said. 

'We never meant
 to cause any harm or disrespect to anyone, particularly our men and 
women in uniform. We realize it was in incredibly poor taste, and are 
deeply sorry for the offense we have caused.'

But after almost a year of hiding out online, Stone finally Googled herself and found the results relieving.

She said she'd once done so during Veterans Day, and found ex-military members 'wondering where I was, and not in a good way.'

Instead of the endless pages directing hatred at her, this time Stone only found a scattering of what there had been.

Instead, there were unoffensive photos of Stone, along with other Lindsey Stones, such as a Lindsey Stone who had recently won New York State's 500-yard freestyle championship.

'This is monumental,' Stone said.
