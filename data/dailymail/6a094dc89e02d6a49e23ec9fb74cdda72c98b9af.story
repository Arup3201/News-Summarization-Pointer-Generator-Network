A young pilot and his father had a lucky escape when they were forced to crash land in a wheat field in East Yorkshire.

The 18-year-old man encountered low-lying cloud after taking off from Beverly Airfield and made a ‘precautionary landing’ in the wheat.

The pilot, who had recently qualified, and his father, both jumped out of the Cessna A150 unharmed after the landing.

A local resident who was first on the scene said: ‘We came round the corner and we rushed into the field.

‘Already the pilot was out and on the phone and he gave us a thumbs up to say he was OK.’

The Cessna A150 was forced to make the ‘precautionary landing’ as low-lying cloud closed in near Keyingham, East Yorkshire.

Peter
 Spencer, company secretary of Hull Aero Club Ltd, where the aircraft is
 based, said: ‘The pilot had elected to do a precautionary landing after
 encountering adverse weather conditions.

'During the landing the 
nosewheel caught on the uneven field, tipping the aircraft forwards.

‘He
 did what he considered appropriate and the testimony of that was that 
they both walked away. He took a considered judgement to prevent a 
further predicament.

‘Both 
the pilot and his father were wearing harnesses and were uninjured. The 
aeroplane lost its nose wheel, but is repairable.’

Mr Spencer said the club has an ‘enviable’ safety record with few incidents during its 85-year history.

Both the Air Accident Investigation Branch and the Civil Aviation Authority have been informed.

Last
 October a passenger who had never flown a plane before landed a light 
aircraft in the dark at Humberside Airport after the pilot fell ill.

John Wildey, of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, was described as 'nothing short of a hero’ after pulling off the miraculous feat.
