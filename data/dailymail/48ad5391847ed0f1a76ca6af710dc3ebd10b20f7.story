A pilot killed as he reportedly attempted a mid-air somersault in a light aircraft was named today as a British Airways officer.

Andrew Sully, 50, a serving senior first officer with British Airways, died with passenger Simon Chamberlain, 29, when their Yak 52 plane crashed in a field in Crooksmill Green, Essex, on Saturday afternoon.

Witnesses described seeing the plane attempt a 'loop the loop' 100ft in the air before it nosedived into the ground shortly before 3pm.

Fuselage: Wreckage of the crashed Yak 52 was being removed from the airfield near Writtle, Essex

Debris: The plane had taken off from the nearby North Weald airfield before getting into trouble, police said

Two teenage army cadets ran to the burning wreckage in a brave attempt to rescue the two men but were beaten back the flames.

Fire crews arrived shortly after and doused the burning aircraft
 with foam, but the two men inside were killed

Essex Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray today named the pilot as Mr Sully, from Writtle, Essex, and confirmed the identity of the passenger as Mr. Chamberlain, a father-of-one, who had been at nearby North Weald airfield with his family.

Scene: Forensic experts were pictured examining the site of the incident which killed two people

As a senior first officer, Mr Sully would be the second pilot on a British Airways flight. When a person becomes a pilot for the company they start off as a first officer and then have the chance of promotion to the rank of senior first officer and then eventually captain.

A spokesman for British Airways said: 'Andrew was a highly respected and popular member of our pilot team. Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this sad time.'

Mr. Chamberlain, who was a regular at the airfield and a flying enthusiast, was not intending to fly that day and only went up after accepting an impromptu invitation from Mr. Sully.

His family released a statement saying they loved him 'more than anything in the world'.

It read: 'Lizzie, his wife, has lost her best friend and soul mate. His son, Charlie, who will be two years old in August, has lost his father.

'And his parents, Paul and Steph, have lost a loving son. We love him more than anything the world.

'Our hearts also go out to the other person involved in this tragedy.

The aircraft's tail can be seen at the crash scene. Fire crews said it was fully alight when they arrived

A team from the Department of Transport's Air Accidents Investigation Branch are now at the scene

'We know that you will respect the fact that we now need time to grieve and give us the space to heal.'

Alan Crouchman, from the Squadron flight club, based at North Weald airfield, said: 'We are all deeply saddened and shocked at the loss of the two very close friends of ours.

'The thoughts and condolences of everyone at the Airfield go out to their families at this very difficult time.'

Tristram Taylor, 27, saw the crash while driving and stopped to call 999.

Fire crews, who were called from three nearby fire stations to the crash scene, later covered the wreckage, which will now be examined by investigators

He
 said: 'We saw it dip behind a hedge and usually they come up, we see 
stunt planes carrying out moves around here quite a lot, but this time 
it didn't.

'We went a bit further down the road and I could then see the tail end of the plane on the ground and a lot of smoke.

'I
 got out and ran towards it with a couple of Army cadets that were in 
the car behind. They were probably only about 15 or 16 years old.

'There
 were flames coming from the cockpit, they must have been about 10ft 
high. The wind was very strong in the field. I could feel the heat of 
the flames just a few feet away.

'It
 was horrific. The plane was popping and spitting where the fuel was 
catching fire. I don't think anything could have been done.'

Another eyewitness Lee Sifford, 42, said: 'I was driving home when I noticed a plane in the sky.

'It went right up in the air like it was doing a stunt then it just turned sharply and nose dived straight down. A couple of seconds later it was on fire in the field.

Fire crews, who were called from three nearby fire stations to the crash scene, later covered the wreckage, which will now be examined by investigators

'I thought it was a model plane at first because it was climbing so quickly. Then it came down so fast that it couldn’t have turned. I didn’t know if I was dreaming it or not. I just kept thinking "maybe it wasn’t a real plane".

'There wasn’t a lot left of it. I could just see the tail of the plane and the rest of it was on fire. I just thought to myself there’s no chance that anyone is coming out of that alive.'

Police closed part of the A414, which 
runs from Chelmsford to Harlow, in both directions while they dealt with
 the incident, but reopened it shortly before 6pm.

A
 spokesman for the East of England Ambulance Service said: 'The 
ambulance service was called at 2.55pm, dispatching an ambulance, three 
paramedic officers, the hazardous area response team (HART) and Magpas 
helimedics.

'Despite the 
best efforts of crews the casualties were sadly pronounced dead at the 
scene. Ambulance resources have now been stood down.'

Two
 men, instructor Simon Hulme, 33, and his student Spencer Bennett, 43, 
were killed in a similar accident in 2011 when another Yak 52 crashed 
into a lake near Maldon, Essex.

Mr Bennett was on a three-day flying course when the plane he was being trained in came down.

In that incident, the plane was being used as an aerobatics trainer and also took off from the North Weald airfield.

In July 2006, two people died when a Yak 52 crashed and burst into flames as it came in to land at Bournemouth Airport.

And
 in January 2003, Falklands veteran Anthony Hunt, 48, died along with 
his brother Ian, 45, when their aircraft crashed in a field on the 
Easton Neston estate, near Towcester, Northamptonshire, while practising
 aerobatic manoeuvres.

His 
family were awarded £270,000 damages by the High Court in 2006 after an 
investigation found that during maintenance a short screwdriver had 
become wedged into the wires that operated the rear elevators of the 
plane.

Two people also died when a Yak 52 crashed in the Kaluga region, south of Moscow in Russia, in August 2009.

The Yakovlev Yak 52 is a two-seater propeller aircraft first built in the Soviet Union in the 1970s.

The former Soviet Air Force training aircraft is now a popular plane for aerobatic flying around the world.

It
 has a reported top speed of 223mph and a service life of 30 years. It 
is not known how old the aircraft which crashed today was.

An inquest is expected to be opened into the deaths this afternoon.

The Air Accident Investigation Branch is investigating the incident.
