After global success on Twitter Pope Francis is spreading his social media net even wider, by setting up an Instagram account.

The Pope has racked up more than 3milion followers on Twitter, and now hopes to offer inspiration to even more people on his Pope Francis profile.

Since news of Pope Francis' profile hit the headlines his number of Instagram followers has shot up, and currently stands at 5417.

Pope-ular: Pope Francis' Instagram page already has over 5,400 followers and features photographs of His Holiness greeting children and intimate prayer shots

The Vatican itself is also on the Instagram site and its @newsva feed has around 1,700 followers. Posts on the feed include shots of the Vatican itself, and crowds waiting to see the Pope.

But although some may be looking forward to some Rhianna -style 'selfies' the Pope is said to want to offer 'inspiration rather than revelation'.

The news comes as the pontiff visited the Italian hillside town of Assisi to pray at the shrine of Saint Francis, whose name he took when he was elected to be Pope.

As he visited his namesake's hometown, he urged the faithful to follow the example of the 13th-century sait, who renounced a wealthy, dissolute lifestyle to embrace a life of poverty and service to the poor.

Pope Francis' first stop in Assisi was to an institute that cares for gravely disabled children, where he took the time to kiss each child, saying their ‘scars need to be recognized and listened to.’

His
visit showed further proof of the changes he has brought to the 
Catholic Church, including his comment on same-sex relationships saying 
‘who am I to judge?’ when speaking of the gay community.

Francis
continued to spread a message of love and joy when he visited the 
cloistered Sisters of St. Clare, an order founded by one of St. Francis'
followers.  In the Basilica of St. Clare, Pope Francis told the nuns 
that they must be mothers to the church and be joyful.

‘It
makes me sad when I find sisters who aren't joyful,’ he lamented. ‘They
might smile, but with just a smile they could be flight attendants!’

He
showed that same sense of humor later when he told a story about a 
mother who lamented that her 30-year-old son still hadn't gotten married
- a reference to a generation of Italian men who seem unwilling to move
out: ‘Signora,’ Francis recalled telling her. ‘Stop ironing his 
shirts!’

Holding Mass 
at the Sacro Convento and Saint Francis Basilica in Assisi he preached 
the message of St Francis, to ‘love one another as I have loved you,’ 
calling for an end to all the wars in the Middle East.

The
pope has been steadfast in his call for peace in Syria, inspiring 
hundreds of thousands of people around the world to hold a day of 
fasting and prayer when it appeared military strikes against the 
Damascus regime were imminent.

Speaking at the place where it is believed Saint Francis threw off his robes to show his humility, the Pope encouraged people shake of their worldliness as it 'kills souls'.

He also called for people to 'work together' to prevent tragedies such as the Lampedusa boat sinking which claimed 150 lives when it caught 
fire and capsized. Hundreds more are still unaccounted for.

The Pope called for people to 'pray together for those who have lost thei lives. Men, women, children, for their families and for all refugees.'
