The number of deliberately staged 'crash for cash' incidents are at an all time high due to scams carried out by organised gangs.

Insurance companies have seen a 21 per cent increase in fraud claims so far this year compared with 2013 - and Birmingham and Greater London are the worst affected areas.

Bogus claims have added £400million to motorists' insurance premiums - or about £14 for each driver, according to Britain's biggest insurer.

Aviva warns more than half of its motor injury claims fraud is now organised, while it currently has more than 6,500 suspicious injury claims linked to known fraud rings. 

Fraudsters set up an 'accident' by deliberately crashing two of their cars into each other in private or by braking in front of an innocent motorist, causing them to go into the back of their car.

Sometimes the criminals will remove their brake lights to give the unsuspecting victim no warning that they need to stop in time.

Over the years methods have become increasingly sophisticated, involving more than one participant, decoy vehicles and fake witnesses.

Crimestoppers claims that the proceeds of organised insurance fraud is used to finance other crimes, including drug dealing, supply of illegal firearms, money laundering and people trafficking.

The charity explains that a 'supply chain' exists within the gangs including drivers and middlemen to stage crashes, claimants to submit claims and professional who can be duped into helping present what looking like a genuine claim.

Fraudsters either drive in front of each other and stage a crash privately or brake in front of an innocent driver

'Criminal gangs rely upon key individuals and organisations such as recovery and storage companies, motor engineers, car repair body shops, hire car companies, doctors and solicitors – so-called ‘professional enablers',' it added. 

Aviva also revealed other blackspots for so-called 'accidents' include Luton, Manchester, Leeds, Bradford and Slough in Berkshire.

The most notorious areas in Greater London include north and north-west London such as Uxbridge and Harrow, while fraudulent claims in Birmingham totalled more than £4.7million in August alone.

Manchester had been the city with the most claims but the figure has been reduced due to the number of successful operations and prosecutions.  

Tom Gardiner, head of claims fraud for Aviva's UK and Ireland general insurance business, said: 'Crash for cash is not just a financial problem - it's a serious social problem. No other form of insurance fraud puts the public at risk of serious injury.

'Imagine you're driving the kids to school when the car in front slams on their brakes without warning, leaving you no chance of avoiding a crash. 

'These deliberate accidents are on the increase, putting innocent motorists at risk simply so the driver in front can get cash compensation.  

He added: 'We are asking the Government to consider compensating short-term whiplash with rehabilitation, instead of cash.

'Would crash for cash exist if there was no money in it? We don't think so.'

Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: 'It’s worrying that these scams are now attracting the criminal equivalent of big business.

'Industry figures show some kind of fraudulent car insurance claim is made every nine minutes. Worryingly, cash for crash swindles don’t just have a financial cost but also risk life and limb.' 

In August, a 'crash for cash' leader was given a four-year prison sentence for his involvement in seven collisions across the Thames Valley and Metropolitan Police areas.

Nasir Mahmood, 32,along with accomplices Aniela Chaudhry, 39, and Bernie Bautista, 43 - all from Reading - would drive two vehicles in convoy.

The first vehicle would make an erratic manoeuvre, causing the second vehicle to brake suddenly and an innocent driver collide with the rear of it.

Officers discovered paperwork that suggested the organisation of a further 76 collisions.

Investigating officer, Det Con Russell Prentice of the Thames Valley Police Economic Crime Unit said: 'Crash for cash fraud has an impact on the safety of everyday road users when fraudsters chose to deliberately cause traffic collisions for their own financial gain.'
