A Missouri family is celebrating giving birth to rare identical triplets, bringing their family to seven.

But two weeks after the arrival of their daughters - Sonja, Sylvia and Scarlett - on March 19,  Laura and Brad Partridge are still unable to tell the girls apart, so they have devised a nifty plan.

'Everyone has a signature colour,' Laura, from Des Peres, told MailOnline. 'Pink for Scarlett, purple for Sylvia and yellow for Sonja, and they have corresponding outfits.

'A 
friend is even getting me non-toxic nail polish for their toenails so that 
way we know for sure who's who in the middle of the night or during a 
bath.'

Bundles of joy: Laura and Brad Partridge show off their identical triplets, Scarlett, Sylvia and Sonja

Who's who? Scarlett wears pink, Sylvia purple and Sonja yellow as the parents struggle to tell them apart

The babies will remain in intensive care at Mercy Children's Hospital
until they have reached certain feeding and weight goals, which doctors
believe will be around their original due date of May 10.

Despite being born seven weeks early, they all weighed three pounds and are doing well.

'We are doing excellently,' said 34-year-old Laura, who left hospital a week ago. 'We are overjoyed that every one is so well.'

The
Partridges, who also have a three-year-old son, Stephen, and a 
17-month-old daughter, Stella, had feared that the story would not be 
such a happy one.

Peaceful: Scarlett Partridge rests at Mercy St. Louis Hospital on Tuesday alongside her sisters

Nap time: Like her sisters, Sylvia Partridge weighed over three pounds when she was born 7 weeks early

Baby steps: Sonja and her sisters will be able to leave the hospital in several weeks once their weight is up

Laura found out that she was pregnant with triplets during her eight-week scan. She and her husband conceived the babies without the use of fertility treatments.

'The doctor said, "There's one... There's 
two..." I was like, "What!",' she said. 'I honestly don't even remember her telling 
me about the third. They were sharing one placenta so we knew they would
be identical.'

The only multiple births on either side of the family are Brad's grandmother's twin sisters.

After their initial shock subsided, the Partridges grew concerned about the dangers.

'They told us the scary statistics,' she said. 
'We weren't able to celebrate like we were with our other two children. I think it
really wasn't until they were actually born that I could relax.'

Growing: Laura and Brad already have a three-year-old son, Stephen, and a 17-month-old daughter, Stella. Laura was on bed rest in hospital for three weeks before they welcomed their little sisters

Brotherly love: Stephen was originally overwhelmed by the hospital but can't wait to see his sisters again

The family is now overjoyed at getting to know the new additions; Laura said that as well as being identical, they're even alike in personality and take it in turns to have a 'feisty' day.

The couple introduced their other children to the 
babies on Easter Sunday; the siblings are only allowed to the intensive care unit of the
hospital once due to their own young ages.

'It was a bit overwhelming for my 
son,' Laura said of Stephen. 'He covered his eyes when he saw the babies because 
there were machines and tubes around.

'But he thought it was neat that they weren't crying and always talks about going to visit them at the hospital again.'

The likelihood of having identical triplets is unknown, but some estimates range from one in 60,000 births to one in 200 million.

Delicate: Laura has returned home but the girls will remain in intensive care for several more weeks

Colour code: The family plans on painting the babies' toenails in the colours to make bath time easier

Support: The Partridges said family, friends and neighbors have rallied around to help out

Obstetrician Dr. Gilbert Webb said the Partridge trio are only the third set of triplets he has seen in his 27-year career.

'It is extremely rare to have three babies share the same placentas,' he said. 'I'm so happy for Laura and Brad that their beautiful new babies are doing well.'

Laura said relatives, neighbours and church friends are waiting at home, keen to help with the babies. Many have prepared them meals for when they return from long days at the hospital.

'Everyone has been wonderful,' she said - and the love is paying off.

'They are all doing very well,' Brad added of his baby girls. 'They are our one in 200 million babies.'
