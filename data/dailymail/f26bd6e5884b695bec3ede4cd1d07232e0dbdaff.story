England saw their Champions Trophy title hopes extinguished by Germany after suffering a 2-0 quarter-final defeat at the tournament in India.

Olympic gold medallists Germany scored late in the second and fourth quarters, through Moritz Furste and Christopher Ruhr, to set up a semi-final against Australia in Bhubaneswar on Saturday.

Bobby Crutchley's England side had decent second-half chances to get back on level terms, but an equaliser was beyond them, and Ruhr killed off the match with a 57th-minute close-range finish.

Germany took the lead on the stroke of half-time when Furste struck home into the top right of the net from a penalty corner.

They had an opportunity to double their advantage midway through the third quarter but Pilt Arnold's driven cross from the left sped across goal, with Mats Grambusch unable to cash in.

England looked like levelling in the 49th minute but amid a scramble somehow Germany kept the ball from crossing the line, with goalkeeper Nicolas Jacobi saving from Barry Middleton and Adam Dixon also lurking.

Ashley Jackson could not drill in from England's first penalty corner, with Jacobi making a solid save, which he repeated later on in the match.

England were pressing Germany hard but in the 58th minute their hopes were finally dashed. A sharp turn from Grambusch bought him space to send in a cross that Ruhr converted, skilfully lifting the ball high into the net.
