Brides seeking a showstopping dress to ensure all eyes are on them for their big day need look no further.

This incredible silk and tulle concoction, designed by Gianni Molaro, boasts a record-breaking train measuring almost two miles in length.

It was modelled today on the steps of Rome's Trinita dei Monti in Italy to celebrate the opening of Molaro's new workshop, the sheer white material rippling out over the Renaissance stonework to complete the fairytale effect.

Tourists snapped away as three spectacular looking brides posed on the Spanish Steps in front of the Fountain of Four Rivers.

The incredible cream veil was worn by Elena De Angelis for her wedding in the Naples village of Casal di Princice last September.

Her train - which was around 28 times the length of Manchester United's Old Trafford pitch - was carried by an army of volunteers as Miss De Angelis was driven through the streets in a vintage car.

Around 20,000 people attended her wedding to Ferdinand Pucci last year to see the outfit that took dozens of seamstresses months to make.

Made from 1.86-mile (three kilometres) of tulle bordered by six miles of silk, the endless train is apparently tied for the title of world's longest with a design by Andree Salon for this year's Wedding Fair in Bucharest.

A model wearing the silk and lace gown took to the sky in a hot-air balloon in March, allowing the gargantuan train to billow out over the Romanian capital.

Mr Molaro said of his creation last year: 'I was really grateful to be asked to design this veil. I met tens of thousands of people on the way to the church who complimented my idea.

'I wanted this veil to symbolise peace and hope and I think we have achieved this.

'This has been one of the biggest moments in my career as a designer.'

There would be no making a dash for it at the altar in this supersized outfit.

Experts estimate it would take Usain Bolt almost five minutes to run its full length, running at blistering world recording pace.
