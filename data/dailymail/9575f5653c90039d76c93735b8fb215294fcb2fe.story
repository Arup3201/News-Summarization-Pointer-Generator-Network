Roy Hodgson will give Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain until the last possible moment to prove his fitness for the World Cup.

Oxlade-Chamberlain, who was injured in the 2-2 draw with Ecuador, watched England train from the sidelines today. England have until 24 hours before their first game against Italy to name a replacement for the Arsenal midfielder.

'He’s working with physios. We’ll keep our fingers crossed,' Hodgson said.' We won’t make a decision before we go to Brazil. It will be at the very last moment 24 hours before our first game.'

Keeping cool: Raheem Sterling is sprayed down with water at training

Hodgson added: 'We’re working very hard and he’s working hard. Let’s see and hope it’s not too serious.

'He’s a positive character. It was a major blow. He’s had a long period of inactivity and seeing him play well excited us all. So you can imagine how sad he is now he’s on the sidelines but his mood is good.'

Hodgson is banking on the midfielder being fit, stating it will be 'difficult' finding a replacement if he is unable to prove his fitness.

'We’ve spent so much time discussing this squad over the last two months it won’t be difficult to find the right solution if it comes to that.'

Out to impress: Sterling was looking sharp in training despite not being allowed to play against Honduras

Cool customer: Jack Wilshere puts a towel over his face to keep cool during training

The draw with Ecuador featured stand-out performances from Oxlade-Chamberlain and another young charge, Ross Barkley. There has been a growing voice to include Barkley against Honduras on Saturday and again for the opener in Manaus.

The England manager added: 'People are trying to second guess every team and the formation. I reserve the right to put the team out and play the way I want to play for this game. I’m not trying to fool anybody.

'The seven who were rested will play. I’m not here to disguise that. But some of those who played on Wednesday will also take part in this game.

'Raheem Sterling if you saw training you will have seen some outstanding moments from him and other young players. We saw Oxlade-Chamberlain play so well the other day.

'What makes me happy is that it justifies my selection. I was bold to take young players but so far they’ve stepped up to the plate. I hope they’ll continue to grow.'

Hitting the deck: Frank Lampard goes down under the challenge of Jack Wilshere

Sterling was harshly sent off in Wednesday's draw, but Hodgson said he has trained extremely well since.

'his reaction has been excellent. He was unstoppable at times during training. He's not going to lose anything in terms of fitness.

There are more than 11 players who are capable of starting against Italy. I don't need to see him play tomorrow to know how good he is.'

But for all the young players' bravado, question marks still remain over Wayne Rooney. Despite being England's most talented player, the striker has not scored in his previous two World Cups and pressure is mounting.

He was played as a second striker in the win over Peru and shunted out to the left against Ecuador as Hodgson tries to give him game time to find fitness and form.

'We’ve always known he can play 
several positions,' said Hodgson. 'The left-side role, there’s no reason
 to doubt he could play there. But he did well and was important to 
score. His record is quite incredible and we hope he continues that.'

England
 skipper Steven Gerrard, one of the elder statesmen of Hodgson's squad, 
has been impressed with what he's seen by the young members of the 
squad.

'They’re growing day by day,' he said. 'Everyone’s capable of playing in the starting 11. That’s healthy and good.

'One of my roles as captain is to be there for any young lads. I’ll look out for them. Not only Raheem because he’s from Liverpool. I spoke to Alex as well. It’s not about 11 its about 23.

'Alex was man of the match against Ecuador but there were a lot of positives. Ross showed flashes as well. I’m really happy with where we are at the moment with 10 days to go to Italy.'
