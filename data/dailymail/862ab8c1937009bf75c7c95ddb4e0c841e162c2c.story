Jose Mourinho and his Chelsea squad looked in a relaxed mood as the Blues took a stroll around the streets of Velden, Austria ahead of their third pre-season match of the summer.

Chelsea will take on RZ Pellets at the Worthersee Stadion where new signings Cesc Fabregas, Diego Costa and Filipe Luis are likely to play a part.

Former Atletico Madrid left-back Luis looks to be settling in well as he walked alongside Chelsea veteran Petr Cech as the pair got to know each other.

Close to 20,000 tickets have already been
 sold for the pre-season friendly as Mourinho's side look to take 
advantage a pre-season tour in Europe rather than clocking up air miles and jet lag by travelling to Asia or 
the USA.

The west London club have won both of their pre-season games so far with a 5-0 win against Wycombe before coming from two goals down to defeat AFC Wimbledon.

Chelsea skipper John Terry look to have benefited from his summer off, scoring three goals in two games, while Blues youngster Lewis Baker impressed with three assists against AFC Wimbledon on Saturday.
