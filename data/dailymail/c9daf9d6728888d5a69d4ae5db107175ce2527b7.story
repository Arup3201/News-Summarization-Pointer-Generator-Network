Wales rugby union coach Warren Gatland and Winter Olympic gold medallist Lizzy Yarnold have revealed their pride at being recognised in the Queen's Birthday Honours List.

Gatland said he felt 'proud and humbled' to receive an OBE while Yarnold said she hoped her MBE would encourage more young people across Britain to take up winter sports.

Paralympic champions Kelly Gallagher and her guide Charlotte Evans also each received the MBE, while the nation's most successful female golfer Laura Davies is made a Dame.

Three cheers: Warren Gatland has been honoured for leading the British and Irish Lions to victory in Australia

Golden girl: Lizzy Yarnold has been awarded an MBE after winning gold at the Winter Olympics

There is a 
CBE for England women's cricket captain Charlotte Edwards who led her 
team to back-to-back Ashes series wins against Australia, and an MBE for
 her vice-captain Jenny Gunn.

Four-time
 London 2012 Paralympic gold medallist David Weir paid a rich tribute to
 his lifelong coach Jenny Archer, who receives the MBE, while Leeds 
Rhinos captain Kevin Sinfield and motor racing star Dario Franchitti 
also receive MBEs.

Gatland,
 currently in South Africa where he is preparing his side to take on the
 Springboks this weekend, described his award for services to rugby as 
'a massive honour'.

He added: 'I'm absolutely over the moon to be asked to receive that. It's great and I'm very proud and sort of humbled.

'It's
 been a bit of an emotional rollercoaster. As a Kiwi I know they did 
their queen's birthday honours list a couple of weeks ago and that has a
 real New Zealand flavour. To receive something in the UK as a Kiwi is 
pretty special.'

Honour: Laura Davies has been made a Dame for her services to golf

Honoured: Leeds skipper Kevin Sinfield has been made an MBE

Yarnold's
 MBE caps a stellar season for the Kent 25-year-old in which she was 
crowned overall World Cup champion before blitzing her rivals by almost a
 second to win Olympic women's skeleton gold in Sochi.

'My hands started shaking as soon as I saw the envelope was from the Palace,' said Yarnold.

'Getting
 an MBE feels so different to the awards you achieve as an athlete 
because those are the ones you have been working towards day after day 
in training.

'My gold medal has helped give winter sports in Britain more exposure and hopefully this will continue with this latest honour.'

Gallagher
 and Evans combined to win Great Britain's first gold medal on snow at 
an Olympic or Paralympic Games when they triumphed in the women's 
visually-impaired Super-G in Sochi.

Gallagher
 said: 'Without sounding arrogant, I know how much work we put into this
 and it is really nice to be recognised by people from outside our 
sport.'

Weir,
 himself awarded the CBE in 2013 in the wake of his quadruple London 
triumph, said he owed all his success to Archer, whose MBE is for her 
services to disabled sport.

He
 said: 'It is about time and I am delighted for her and I am sure she 
will relish the day. I wouldn't have won any of my medals without 
Jenny.'

In
 addition, Swansea City director Gwilyn Joseph receives the MBE while 
there are OBEs for Malcolm Morley, the former chairman of the British 
Wrestling Association, and Barbara Slater, director of BBC Sport, for 
services to sports broadcasting.
