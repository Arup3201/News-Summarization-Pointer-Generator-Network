Keith Crisco, an Asheboro, North Carolina businessman who was running neck-and-neck with former American Idol runner up Clay Aiken for a Democratic congressional nomination, died suddenly Monday afternoon.

According to the Asheboro Courier-Tribune, the 71-year-old died of injuries sustained in a fall at his home.

Aiken was leading Crisco by just 369 votes in the primary race, and it was considered too close to call.

Incumbent Rep. Renee Ellmers, a Republican, will now likely take on Aiken in November.

Rest in peace: Congressional candidate Keith Crisco died at his home in Asheboro, N.C. on Monday, putting singer Clay Aiken in the November congressional race against Renee Ellmers

Clay Aiken (R) was officially leading Crisco by 369 votes before outstanding absentee and provisional ballots were counted, and now seems to be the Democrats' definite November candidate

'I am deeply saddened by this sudden and painful tragedy and wish God's blessings for Keith's family through the coming days,' Ellmers said Monday.

'His kindness and dedication to his principles were models we should all strive toward, and he will be dearly missed.'

Aiken, 35, issued a statement shortly after the news was confirmed by Crisco's textile company, Asheboro Elastics.

'I am stunned and deeply saddened by Keith Crisco's death,' the entertained said. 'Keith came from humble beginnings. No matter how high he rose – to Harvard, to the White House and to the Governor's Cabinet – he never forgot where he came from.'

'He was a gentleman, a good and honorable man and an extraordinary public servant. I was honored to know him. I am suspending all campaign activities as we pray for his family and friends.'

The North Carolina Republican Party also issued a statement of sympathy.

'We are incredibly shocked and saddened to hear about Keith Crisco’s sudden passing,' the state party said.

'Keith was an accomplished businessman and public servant with a sterling reputation and a tremendous amount of respect from North Carolinians across the partisan spectrum.'

Crisco served as secretary of commerce for North Carolina from 2009 to 2013.

In that role he was one of the state's
 most prolific recruiters of businesses from other states, serving in 
the administration of then-Gov. Bev Perdue.

Aiken has cast himself as a centrist, and will have to overcome his district's strong bloc of evangelical Christian voters who tend to vote Republican. 

Has has said previously that he doesn't believe the fact he is gay will affect whether people vote for him.

Aiken had been carefully watching the vote-total numbers, spokeswoman Tucker Middleton told the Associated Press.

'It's close, but we're confident,' she said last week.

Both candidates were waiting for an official result before deciding whether to request a recount. There weren't enough uncounted ballots to swing the election, but the margin could have narrowed enough to permit a recount request.

Crisco had released a statement last Wednesday calling the contest 'still very tight.'

'I want the elections officials to have an opportunity to tally the votes and provide a report on their canvass activities to allow all the campaigns a chance to see the final numbers,' he insisted then.

Crisco was a former North Carolina secretary of commerce known for recruiting businesses to the Tarheel State from other U.S. regions

Now the nearly 400 outstanding absentee ballots won't likely matter.

The state board of elections also issued a statement of condolence.

'A native of North Carolina, we are grateful for Mr. Crisco’s service to our state and his community through the years,' the statement read. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with the Crisco family during this difficult time.'

An board employee in Raleigh told MailOnline that it's still possible Crisco could emerge as the official Democratic primary winner.

If that should happen, the employee said, it would be up to the state Democratic Party to determine how to proceed with its congressional nomination.

But the News and Observer newspaper reported Monday afternoon that Crisco had met with a campaign adviser just hours before his death to discuss conceding the race.

Crisco was married for 49 years, and had three children and six grandchildren.
