A rogue builder has been fined more than £30,000 for forcing a bricklayer to balance in the bucket of a digger before hoisting him 20ft up in the air to avoid having to pay out for proper scaffolding.

Residents on a new housing estate watched in horror as unfortunate brickie Paul Holder, 48, was ordered to climb into the bucket and fit window sills by the firm he was working for, Paddle Ltd.

The company's then owner Derek Barnes, 75, has been ordered by the courts to pay £32,000 and Paddle has been slapped with an additional fine of £56,000 after admitting a breach of Work at Height Regulations.

Precarious: Paddle flouted health and safety when bricklayer Paul Holder was hoisted in the air to fit window sills from the bucket of a digger

Defending Barnes and Paddle at a hearing at Swansea Crown Court earlier today,  Rebecca Hirst said he had been 'tired and frustrated' on the day in question, and denied accusations of a 'wholescale disregard for safety'.

But the court heard Health and Safety chiefs were tipped off and caught the rogue building firm in the act.

Prosecutor Robin Havard said: 
'Residents watched as Mr Holder perched himself on the bucket of the 
digger and was raised to the top floor of the house.

'He worked in that precarious position because the company decided to use the digger rather than set up scaffolding.'

Since 2000 the Paddle has been issued with 25 different prohibition or improvement notices by the Health and Safety Executive.

The court heard how another of Paddle's workers suffered a hairline fracture of the spine when scaffolding he was working from gave way.

Bricklayer Daniel King, 22, plummeted 12ft when scaffolding collapsed because it had not been fixed to the ground properly.

The court was told the firm's owner Derek Barnes, 75, didn't ask Mr King about his injuries and told him to carry on working.

Mr King told the court: 'I can't believe how negligent, ignorant and incompetent their attitude was towards me.'

Sentencing Barnes, the judge said he and Paddle had 'driven a coach and horses through safety regulations', and banned him from being a company director for three years as well as fining him.
