England are the embarrassment of the World Cup after a third humiliating defeat in three matches against Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka.

Sportsmail's panel of experts — Nasser Hussain, David Lloyd, cricket correspondent Paul Newman and cricket writer and Wisden editor Lawrence Booth — discuss the big questions arising from another World Cup failure.

Is there any hope left for England at this World Cup?

Nasser Hussain: If there is, it's because of the ridiculous format of this tournament. They should beat Bangladesh and Afghanistan, but the best we can hope for is some one-off brilliance in the quarter-final.

Paul Newman: You would think not and yet the flawed format still gives them every chance of facing India, a team they have beaten in their past two meetings, in a quarter-final in Melbourne. That should not be possible after the way England have stunk the tournament out.

Lawrence Booth: The bare minimum for them was a quarter-final. Now, if either Bangladesh or Afghanistan have a good day, they may not even make that. They've had four years to prepare, yet look further off the pace than ever.

David Lloyd: Realistically, no. It's sad to see so much effort going into plans and strategy that just do not fit in modern international cricket. I've never seen a team leave the ball so much in the one-day game. If there's any width other teams just whack it.

Can anything be done in the short-term?

Hussain: They need variety in their bowling, and a more attacking No 3. If they get through to a quarter-final on a drop-in wicket against India or South Africa, four 85mph right-arm seamers aren't going to surprise anyone. Ravi Bopara offers something different, and Tredwell is England's best off-spinner. And I'd get Hales in for Ballance.

Newman: They must play Alex Hales. Why not? Gary Ballance should not be learning the ropes in the biggest limited-overs tournament of all. England just do not seem to rate Hales and if that is the case what is he doing here? If he does not play in Adelaide on Monday they might as well send him home. And get Jos Buttler in earlier. Leaving him just 19 balls against Sri Lanka was criminal.

Booth: They've got to stop going on about stats, which mean little in the new era of fielding restrictions, and go for broke with players who scare the opposition. Hales springs to mind. They should also pick their best spinner, James Tredwell, because four right-arm seamers aren't doing the job.

Lloyd: Hales can be brought in but don't expect him to start blasting it. If he was a success from the word go it would be a bonus. So many people in the game say he should have been in the 50-over team for the past 18 months!

And what about the long-term?

Hussain: There's no easy fix. But I wish selectors would show faith in their one-day players like in Test cricket: look at how they backed Joe Root. Give Hales 20 one- dayers to see what he's made of.

Newman: Rip it up and start again. England need to work towards as separate a one-day team as possible, leaving Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad, to name two, to focus on Tests. Bring in the likes of Sam Billings, Jason Roy and Ben Stokes and keep them together, ideally under a different coach working on modern limited-overs skills.

Perhaps Paul Farbrace, who won the Asia Cup and World T20 with Sri Lanka, could step up while Peter Moores concentrates on Tests. I know split coaches didn't work last time but England prioritised Test cricket then. They have to give equal billing to 50 and 20-over cricket from now.

Booth: England have to accept, finally, that the game has changed, and back more youngsters — the likes of Roy and James Vince. But the problem runs deeper: England is inherently a Test nation. Until they take 50-over cricket seriously, they'll always flop at World Cups.

Lloyd: England need to show imagination in selection. Think about the words 'dynamic' and 'power' and pick the team accordingly. I'll throw in three names: Stokes, Roy and Adil Rashid. I'd implore England to look at how other teams are doing it — people like Aussie Glenn Maxwell, Corey Anderson of New Zealand and the dynamic Australian duo of David Warner and Aaron Finch. They show absolutely no fear at all.

What do you think of Eoin Morgan as captain?

Hussain: I've been disappointed with the way he's become infected with management-speak. Here's a player whose flair and inventiveness made him what he is. Instead, he's talking about statistics. But you do need a plan, and a captain's only as good as his bowling attack.

Newman: Disappointing so far. Still looks out of form with the bat, hasn't been the pro-active, imaginative leader we hoped and seems to be in denial. He should be criticised for playing in the IPL rather than leading England against Ireland in May. If he doesn't want the captaincy, give it to Root.

Booth: He has a bit more about him tactically than Alastair Cook. Morgan was given just the tri-series in Australia to prepare. What did the ECB expect?

Lloyd: I like Morgan immensely but I shudder at the interviews he's giving. He's just talking statistics all the time! Forget stats — if we've got the players to make an impact, let them play in a different style, on instinct. He must also show more imagination in the field.

Does Moores still have much to prove as coach?

Hussain: Yes, lots. He's partly a victim of England's one-day struggles, but it's a worry to see some players going backwards. Turning round the Test series against India was to his credit, but he'll be judged on the rest of this World Cup and the Ashes later this year.

Newman: I so want him to succeed, but there are worrying signs he looks out of his depth at international level. The players seem to like and respect him but he does not seem to be inspiring them.

Booth: He has everything to prove. He was lucky to be re-appointed and results have mainly been poor. He inherited a shambles but at some point that stops being relevant.

Lloyd: Peter is ageing by the day. I hope he is looking at what other coaches like Darren Lehmann and Mike Hesson are doing with Australia and New Zealand. Don't have any regard for reputations — swing from the hip.

Can Kevin Pietersen really play for England again?

Hussain: I've always believed in picking the best side, then man-managing it. But I feel there's too much baggage with KP now. Also, he's not the player he once was. If he was 24, rather than 34, you might give him another go. But the focus should be on England's one-day team, not Pietersen.

Newman: Well, what a can of worms incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves opened. The suggestion is that nothing has changed regarding Pietersen but Graves' clumsy words undermined the management while the ECB's attempt to distance themselves from his comments by talking about 'positive influences' just made it worse.

Booth: Would he really have saved England at the World Cup? He played nine ODIs in 2013 and averaged 28. And he'll be 35 soon. I loved watching him, but let's not pretend he's a panacea.

Lloyd: If it is going to happen Kevin must be playing county cricket — red-ball and white-ball. If he commits to the English game and scores heavily then he should be back in the mix.

Whether or not Kevin Pietersen should return to the England set-up remains a hotly contested debate

Sportsmail experts are skeptical that 34-year-old Pietersen's return would necessarily improve England
