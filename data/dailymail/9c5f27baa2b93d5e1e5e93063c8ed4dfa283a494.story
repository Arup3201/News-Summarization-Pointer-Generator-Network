A senator's town hall meeting in Portland, Oregon was called off early on Saturday after anti-police and minimum-wage-hike protesters shouted down a 100-year-old U.S. Navy veteran's medal ceremony,

Shouting 'Hands up, don't shoot' and 'I can't breathe,' more than 100 mostly African-American activists jousted verbally with hecklers from the audience who were assembled for a dialog with Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden – and to honor Dario Raschio.

When the ensuing chaos reached a fever pitch, the centenarian Raschio took the microphone to scold the protesters.

'Give me a chance,' the soft-spoken vet said. 'Let's show a little respect for this occasion.'

HANDS UP, DON'T SHOOT: Protesters stormed into Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden's town hall meeting Saturday in Portland, refusing to leave and eventually shutting the event down

Wyden planned to honor 100-year-old Dario Raschio and tweeted that he was pleased 'to present my neighbor with long-overdue medals he earned in WWII'

'I'LL BUST YOUR JAW, OLD MAN!': One activist (right) threatened to harm a campus public safety officer if protesters weren't allowed inside

'God bless America. And you people who are here for a cause, whatever it might be – show respect to Senator Wyden,' he urged, bringing an eruption of applause from the audience.

But the boisterous chants grew so loud – including shouts for a $15 minimum wage and the end of U.S. military intervention in the Middle East – that the meeting was disbanded 45 minutes after it was scheduled to begin.

Raschio's medal presentation was the only part of the day's agenda that actually happened.

The senator awarded him the U.S. Naval Aviator Badge, the American Campaign Medal, the Asiatic Pacific Campaign Medal, the World War II Victory medal, the American Defense Service Medal, the "Ruptured Duck" award and the U.S. Navy Honorable discharge pin.

He also received a flag that was flown over the U.S Capitol in Washington, D.C.

Wyden never got a chance to conduct his planned question-and-answer session with the public. 

NOT AMUSED: The audience sat and watched the drama unfold but never got to ask the senator any questions after the meeting was hijacked

But the liberal stalwart seemed unperturbed, telling The Oregonian that 'the symbolism of having a veteran, 100 years old, who fought so gallantly so that those who disagree with government policies and want to exercise their First Amendment rights could be heard – that's what made today so poignant.'

Wyden is a far-left politician who has leveraged organized protesters in the past to help him pass legislation.

Following the downfall of the 'Stop Online Piracy Act' in 2012, Wyden cited 'massive protests' and a 'grassroots victory for the history books' as the main reason for his success in blocking the bill.

Activists in every U.S. state have shouted 'Hands up, don't shoot' during demonstrations opposing the fatal shooting of black 18-year-old Michael Brown by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri in August.

'I can't breathe,' another rallying cry,' were the last words uttered by Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died in July at the hands of a New York City police officer trying to subdue him.

Campus public safety officers attempted to keep some of the protesters outside the building at Portland Community College, drawing threats from one of them.

'I'll bust your jaw, old man!' he shouted in an exchange caught on video. 

BEFUDDLED: An annoyed Sen. Wyden stood and watched as his event disintegrated at the hands of protesters whose politics he shares

'MIC CHECK!' This protest leader organized her followers with chants drawn from the infamous 'Occupy Wall Street' encampments

Another argued with security, who asked if there was 'a possible way that we could get on with the meeting.'

'No,' she said. 'We're taking over the town hall. This is our town hall now. ... it belongs to the black people.'

On Saturday, two protesters never made it to the event. Katharine Moore, 36, and Malcolm Chaddock, 51, were cuffed and booked after they refused to obey police commands to stop blocking traffic while protesting outside.

They were charged with second-degree disorderly conduct.

Wyden, Oregon's senior senator, has said he wants to hold a town hall meeting in every one of Oregon's 36 counties – this year, and every year.

OPB News reports that he has convened more than 700 such meetings so far.
