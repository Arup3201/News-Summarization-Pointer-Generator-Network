Thousands of children aged 10 and younger are so depressed, anxious and stressed out that they require medical treatment, it has emerged.

Up to 10 per cent of schoolchildren are believed to be affected by some form of mental illness, according to campaigners.

And it has now been revealed that worrying numbers of young people are being treated for serious mental issues in hospitals and other NHS centres.

Experts blame the 'toxic climate' of the bullying culture on websites popular among the young, as well as other pressures of modern life, for fuelling the spate of anxiety.

Fears: A worrying number of children aged 10 or under are suffering from mental health problems, new findings have revealed (picture posed by model)

Despite the epidemic of mental health problems among children and young people, two thirds of councils have cut spending on services intended to tackle the issue.

A total of 4,391 children aged 10 or below have been treated for depression, anxiety or stress in the past five years at two of Britain's biggest NHS mental health trusts.

The figures from South London and Maudsley trust and South Essex Partnership University trust were revealed following a Freedom of Information request from the Daily Mirror.

They cover just two out of 60 mental health trusts in England alone - meaning that the true number of children affected is undoubtedly much higher.

Tragic: 15-year-old Tallulah Wilson killed herself after visiting self-harm websites

Children's mental health charity YoungMinds estimates that 96,000 children aged between five and 10 suffer from an anxiety disorder, while 8,700 are seriously depressed.

Overall, more than half a million children and young people up to the age of 16 are affected by a diagnosable mental health disorder, according to the charity.

The problems are significantly worse for children in care, three quarters of whom suffer from behavioural or emotional issues.

YoungMinds has previously forecast that by 2020, 100,000 children could be hospitalised every year due to self-harming.

'An increase in under-11s needing mental health services is a sad and very worrying indictment of the society we live in and the pressures children face,' the charity's Lucie Russell told the Mirror.

'Every day we hear about the unprecedented toxic climate young people face in a 24/7 online culture where they can never switch off, where they experience constant assessments at school, bullying, sexualisation, consumerism and pressure to have the perfect body at a young age.'

A survey by YoungMinds revealed that 34 out of 51 local councils had cut spending on mental health services for children and teenagers since 2010.

Former Health Secretary Alan Johnson called for an investigation into the new findings, describing the number of children requiring treatment as 'shocking'.

He told the Mirror: 'It is clear children are increasingly having to receive NHS care because of cuts to child and adolescent mental health budgets.'

Health minister Norman Lamb said: 'Children's mental health is a priority for this Government and we are investing Â£54million over this Parliament into improving access to therapeutic treatments for children.

'I have always been clear that mental health must be treated with equal importance as physical health and it is totally unacceptable to disadvantage mental health when allocating local funds.'

A number of tragic suicides among children have recently been linked to online bullying as well as websites which are accused of glamourising self-harm.

The mother of 15-year-old Tallulah Wilson, who threw herself under a train 16 months ago, blamed her daughter's death on 'a toxic digital world'.
