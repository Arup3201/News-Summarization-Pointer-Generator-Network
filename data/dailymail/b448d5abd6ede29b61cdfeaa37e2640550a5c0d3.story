A record-breaking woman who has trekked on horseback from the Beijing Olympics to the 2012 Games in London is on the home straight - after a staggering four year journey.

Megan Lewis, a 63-year-old mother of three, has let nothing distract her from reaching the finish line - coping with broken ribs and a punctured lung, sleeping inches from scorpions, and even the breakdown of her marriage during the gruelling trek.

Megan said her separation from her husband was a 'desperately sad time', and admitted that falling from her horse and breaking her ribs just ten days into her epic trek 'wasn't the best of starts', but she added: 'Apart from that it has all been pretty easy'.

The former geography teacher, from Pumpsaint in Carmarthenshire, Wales, started in October 2008 on the outskirts of Beijing - host to the last Olympic Games - and is now galloping through Surrey towards the London venue.

She has used seven horses and travelled nine countries on the trek - dubbed the Long Horse Ride - which took her along the Great Wall of China, through the Gobi desert, across the desert flats of Kazakhstan and on through mainland Europe.

The 63-year-old has spent between six and eight hours each day in the saddle over the past four years, as she trekked through China, Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine, Hungary, Austria, Germany, France, and finally the UK.

It hasn't been an entirely smooth ride for Megan and her faithful steeds; the former teacher was hospitalised when she fell off her horse just ten days into her journey.

'I fell off 10 days after leaving Beijing and broke six ribs and punctured a lung,' she said.

'The horse got spooked and shot forwards. I wasn't paying attention and fell off the back landing on my head.

'I ended up having to go to hospital and it set me back three months.'

Megan and her back-up team also spent three weeks stuck on the border of Ukraine and Hungary because of a problem with her EU paperwork.

'We were in no-man's land waiting for all the correct documents. It was all very frustrating,' she said.

Megan's marriage also suffered as a result of the huge undertaking, and she and her husband have split up since she set off from Beijing four years ago.

'My husband was very supportive, especially as I'm raising money for his charity,' she said.

'But
during the journey our relationship deteriorated. The stress of it all 
and the distance took their toll and we ended up separating.

'It was a desperately sad time, but I persevered.'

In fact the 63-year-old remained undeterred by any of the challenges she faced during the 8,000 mile trek.

'If you can cross China then the rest becomes child's play in comparison,' she said.

Megan spent many nights sleeping camped out under the stars or in the back of her horse trailer - often going weeks without a shower.

'It hasn't been comfortable,' said Megan, speaking while en route.

'I
used to wash in a small plastic bowl, but because of the scarcity of 
water we would go weeks without a wash - it would get to the point where
a wash was a treat.'

Throughout the journey Megan has ridden seven horses - named Baiju, Shan Dan, Little Bolasak, Big Bolasak and three named Zorbee.

Well earned rest: Megan slept in her horse box for much of the Europe leg of the trip, before which she and her team stayed in small hotels, houses, truck stops, or simply camped out under the stars

She used local guides to help her
navigate tricky terrain and negotiate strict border controls as she passed
through various countries.

Megan said the hospitality shown to her and her team by locals across Asia and Europe was one of the highlights of her adventure.

'Being invited into people's homes and having banquets laid on for us has been touching,' she said.

'I've even had locals run up to us and hand over gifts - anything from apples to onions.'

'My children think I am completely mad, but are not surprised,' said lifelong horse-rider Megan, who added that a lengthy trek had always been an ambition.

'I think I've had a leaning towards Asia because I was brought up in the Far East,' she said.

'And then with the Olympics being handed over from Beijing to London, and my children having all flown the nest - it was all perfect timing.'
