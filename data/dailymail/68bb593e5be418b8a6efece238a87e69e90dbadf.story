Alan Pardew has told Arsenal fans to lay off Arsene Wenger and believes they should be grateful for all he has done at the club.

The Newcastle boss insists that only Sir Alex Ferguson has achieved more in the Premier League era because Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho ‘hasn’t done enough yet’.

Pardew goes so far as to say that the Emirates Stadium should be renamed in honour of Wenger.

Arsene Wenger has been in charge of Arsenal since 1996, leading the club to multiple trophies and titles

The Arsenal boss is under increasing pressure after he was abused by his own supporters at a railway station following last weekend’s 3-2 defeat at Stoke, a result that left Arsenal sixth in the table and 13 points behind leaders Chelsea. 

But Pardew, who faces Wenger in Saturdays tea-time kick-off, said: ‘The incident at the train station was totally disrespectful. I think 99 per cent of Arsenal fans would have been ashamed of that and we could get the backlash of it. They will want to show how much they love him.

‘That stadium should be named after him. The job he did in that move across (from Highbury), when they had all that debt and he had to be very careful with the transfer budget — it was a miracle that he kept them in the Champions League.

‘I think everyone at Arsenal knows he’s done a magnificent job. For me, he’s the second best manager in Premier League history (behind Sir Alex Ferguson). Jose (Mourinho) hasn’t done enough yet.’

Wenger has found an unlikely ally in Pardew, the man he once shoved in a heated touchline fracas. 

They clashed at Upton Park in 2006 when Pardew’s West Ham scored a late winner against the Gunners, but the pair are now the longest-serving bosses in the top flight. 

And Pardew added: ‘I’ve had one run-in with Arsene, but otherwise he’s been fantastic. I have nothing but respect for him and I’ve always enjoyed watching his teams.’

Arsenal and Newcastle are only separated by goal difference and an away victory would intensify the scrutiny on Wenger and his position, despite them making it through to the Champions League knockout stages for the 15th consecutive season after Tuesday’s 4-1 win at Galatasaray.

But Pardew, who survived calls for his own sacking earlier in the season, admitted: ‘Arsene knows that instant results are massive, even for someone who has been in the position as long as he has. All of us managers are on a six-game, seven-game period with the media and social media. We have to accept that.’

Pardew, though, hopes Wenger was cheered by Newcastle’s 2-1 victory over Mourinho’s Chelsea, meaning Arsenal’s unbeaten ‘Invincibles’ tag from the 2003-2004 campaign remains intact at least for another season. ‘I imagine Arsene might have had a glass of wine after that game,’ said Pardew. ‘When you have that tag you don’t want to lose it to anyone.

‘But we can only worry about us, it was a tremendous performance against Chelsea and the players can be proud.

‘We’re on a good run but this is a difficult one because Arsenal away has not been a happy hunting ground for us. They have given us a thumping and on one occasion it was an embarrassing scoreline (7-3, in 2012).

‘The games at our place have been a lot closer and we hope this one is a lot tighter as well.’
