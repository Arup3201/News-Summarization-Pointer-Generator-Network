Remarkable factory The Algha Works has been making spectacles on Fish Island in east London since 1932 and remains almost entirely unchanged.

In 1932, entrepreneur Max Wiseman imported into the UK an entire factory of spectacle frame-making machinery and staff from Germany.

Wiseman asked his sons to set up a factory in England to manufacture Rolled Gold frames and together the established the business with 10 German technicians.

The gamble paid off and the factory fast became a famous manufacturer, including the 'round-eye' - a design classic.

Business really started booming when the company was required to make glasses for the NHS, until the 1980s when prescription glasses were deregulated.

After a difficult time for the company, they are stocked all over the world now from Brazil to Belgium.

Retro shapes remain the foundation of their Savile Row collection, and are still popular after John Lennon made the round-eye famous in the sixties, as well as the timeless 'panto' style worn by Eric Clapton.

The work takes of hours of precise concentration and they offer a bespoke service in which customers can adapt every aspect of the glasses to their specifications

Now it is the only frame maker left in 
Britain, the factory is still in business today producing glasses under 
the Savile Row brand - and mainly exports its products.

The original machines are still used to hand-craft the spectacles, which have been worn recently by the likes of Harry Potter, Denzel Washington and Johnny Depp.

It takes around two years from new members of staff to learn all the quirks of the antique machinery inside out.

Famous fans include Ralph Lauren who wears the Panto 47 with silver skull temples, Robin Williams who has worn the Beaufort Panto with a chestnut front, Sean Connery in the Diaflex High Mount Gold and the Queen who has been spotted wearing the Half Moon style.

Using antique tools and machines, the craftsmen can even make entirely bespoke frames for which customers can specify eyeshape, type of bridge, type of temple, temple tip colour, frame metal colour, rim colour and lens type.
