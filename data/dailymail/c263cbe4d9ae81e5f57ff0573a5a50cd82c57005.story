A blanket of early-morning fog and mist cleared to make way for beautiful scenes across the UK today, as a giant weather front which is stretching across the entire Atlantic was poised to bring more heavy showers and gusty winds over the weekend.

The effects of the low pressure system, which is currently sitting to the west of Britain in the middle of the Atlantic, will load the UK with unsettled weather for the next five days, including thundery showers, strong winds - and unseasonably warm temperatures. 

Forecasters have also warned that Hurricane Gonzalo - the strongest Atlantic storm in three years which is due to hit Bermuda on Friday - could potentially pummel across to the UK on Monday night, bringing 50mph gales and heavy downpours.

Despite calm scenes at sunset, forecasters warn the effects of a low pressure system, currently sitting to the west of Britain in the middle of the Atlantic, will load the UK with thundery showers and strong winds

But there will be unseasonably warm temperatures, some six degrees above average for this time of year. This morning, these dog walkers made the most of the balmy weather as they strolled through Greenwich Park, London

The beautiful scenes were a far cry from some of the most severe weather which has been battering Britain over the past few days 

These horse riders in Somerset made the most of the calm weather, before Hurricane Gonzalo - the strongest Atlantic storm in three years which is due to hit Bermuda on Friday - could potentially move across to the UK

A bird perched itself on ruins in Somerset, as it watched over the low mist clouds moving across the countryside  

But temperatures will still continue to soar, with the mercury expected to reach 21C in parts of the UK on Saturday and Sunday  - some six degrees above average for this time of year.

Gonzalo has already battered islands across the West Indies, with images revealing destroyed boats, down trees and debris strewn across beaches in Guadeloupe, Saint Barthelemy and Saint-Martin on Tuesday.

The storm, which was yesterday upgraded to a category four hurricane as its winds reached 125mph, is poised to hit Bermuda on Friday and then move onto Canada on Sunday.

A spokesman for the Met Office said Gonzalo could hit the UK by early next week, bringing 50mph winds and heavy rain - but she said Britain should be braced for those conditions anyway, regardless of Gonzalo's movement.

She said: 'Gonzalo could hit us by Monday - but it could not. It could swoop northwards and miss us completely - the path is still largely unknown. If it does hit us, it won't be a hurricane by the time it does and the effects of it will be no different to the usual autumnal weather we have seen lately. 

'But, if it does arrive, there could be winds of 50mph and heavy rain.'

Until then, the existing low pressure system sweeping across the Atlantic - separate to Gonzalo - will leave Britain at its mercy. 

Despite stunning scenes showing mist and cloud calmly clearing at sunrise this morning, a band of rain caused by the system will move across  the UK this afternoon, bringing thundery showers to Wales, the south west and north west England. 

The early-morning mist was also seen gliding over London this morning, making way for a day of sunshine and warm temperatures

Keswick, in the Lake District, looked stunning in the early-morning sunshine today. But an existing low pressure system sweeping across the Atlantic - separate to Gonzalo - is expected to leave Britain at its mercy

Two paddleboarders made their way across Derwent Water near Keswick, Cumbria, as they made the most of the dry weather 

A canoe was also spotted out on the water this morning, as fog and mist cleared to make way for beautiful sunshine 

But that stormy weather should fade by this evening, making way for calmer scenes tomorrow, as sunshine spreads across many parts of the country.

By Saturday, temperatures could reach 21C in parts of the south east, while central and eastern parts will also bask in glorious sunshine. 

But this will be interrupted with periods of heavy rain  in western areas, Wales, the north west and Scotland. A band of rain will also linger over parts of Kent and the far south east coast.

Forecasters say the warm weather will continue through Sunday, although the blustery and breezy winds caused by the Atlantic front means it will not feel particularly warm. Bouts of rain will also continue to hang around the south east, while showers will be seen across western parts and the Midlands. 

But storm clouds were also seen gathering across the City of London later on, as Britain prepares itself for days of unsettled weather

Ferocious waves crashed into the Torry Battery lighthouse in Aberdeen this morning, as wintry, wet conditions hit Scotland 

Fierce gusts whipped up the water up into a frenzy. Parts of Scotland will be drenched in heavy showers over the weekend 

Grey clouds moved overhead as the lighthouse took a battering - a sign of the unpredictable weather to come over the next few days

Commuters heading into Leeds battled through the fog and mist on the M621 this morning

A Meteogroup spokesman said: 'Tomorrow, a band of cloud and increasingly light and patchy rain in northern Scotland will become confined to the Northern Isles.

'Many other parts of the UK will have a dry morning with sunny spells, although isolated showers may affect southern and western areas. Through the afternoon, winds will freshen as an area of rain edges in from the south-west, reaching all areas during the evening. 

'On Saturday, rain may persist for a time across some southern counties of England while the rest of the UK will have variable cloud and blustery showers, these potentially heavy and thundery.

'On Sunday, it looks set to remain fairly windy and unsettled with sunny spells and heavy showers, these most frequent in the north and west.' 

The huge pressure system is just one of three huge depressions filing the Atlantic Ocean at the moment, with Hurricane Fay also barrelling towards Bermuda, along with Hurricane Gonzalo.

They are the latest weather systems to move in from the US and play havoc with Britain's climate.

In August this year, five flood warnings and 33 flood alerts were brought in when the remnants of Hurricane Bertha moved up from the Caribbean and swept across Britain.

That hurricane formed in the warm waters of the Caribbean first lashed the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands with winds of up to 90mph.

Bertha then travelled north, veering away from the US and Canadian coast before heading across the Atlantic and being downgraded to an 'Atlantic storm', which dropped 20mm of rain an hour on some parts of the UK.

But hurricanes emanating from the region are not always bad news for Britain. Hurricane Cristobal, which ravaged parts of the Caribbean, brought warm weather to the UK later in August this year by dragging an area of high pressure up from Europe.
