Police were called to the school but confirmed the death is not being treated as suspicious.

It is unclear what the girl was doing at the time of her death and her name has not yet been revealed.

It is understood the girl did not have any underlying health problems and the coroner has been informed.

Spokesman for the school Simon Mayes 
said: 'This has been a complete shock as she was only 17 and we are 
currently talking with her parents.'

St Swithun’s School, whose 
headmistress is Jane Gandee, charges £9,070 a term for boarders and 
educates girls aged 11 to 18 on a boarding and day basis.

It has about 440 pupils of whom about 200 are boarders. It also runs a co-educational prep school.

The school puts strong emphasis on sport and was national lacrosse champions in 2008.

Girls at the schools are given the option of trying a wide range of sports including athletics, badminton, basketball, cricket, lacrosse and netball.

It has not been revealed whether the dead girl was playing sport at the time she was taken ill.

The school's headmistress, Jane Gandee said 'our pupils and staff are deeply shocked by this incident [and] our thoughts and prayers are with the girl’s family at this time.'
