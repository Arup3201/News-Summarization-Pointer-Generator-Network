A royal fan‎ was stopped by secret service officers after she went to the home where the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry are staying.

Beverly McPhail traveled from Florida to see the royals as they attend the wedding of one of their best friends in Memphis.

On Friday, the 29-year-old who is 15-weeks-pregnant went ‎to the private house where William and Harry have been while in Tennessee.

When she was later seen by protection officers outside the venue for the rehearsal dinner she was questioned.

Local TV news reporter Katie Rufener‎, who witnessed the incident, said: 'Security is crazy tight. Secret service are questioning a lady who was taking pictures outside the estate where the royals are staying.

'The woman says the secret service and CIA wanted to make sure she wasn't a threat, because she came from Florida to see the royals.‎'

Mrs McPhail, who made the 750 mile journey from her home in Orlando, Florida, earlier said she had been planning to follow the princes in a bid to meet them.

But she insisted she was 'not a stalker', adding: 'I would call myself a royal watcher.

Last night she said that she had decided to stop following the royals around Memphis after she was asked by officers what she had been doing.

She told MailOnline: 'I'm just going to stay away. They were very nice but they've made me nervous.

'I didn't do anything ‎wrong. I didn't go onto the property where they are staying, I was just outside. They wanted to know what I was doing as I have come all the way from Florida.

'‎I'm still glad I came to Memphis to see the royals. I booked to come after first hearing about the wedding six months ago. I went to London for the royal wedding, so this was not that far to go.

'I just want to see them. We’re not used to royalty. I’ve liked the royal family since Princess Diana.’

Mrs McPhail, who is expecting her first child, came to Memphis with her mother-in-law Sheryl, 58.

She was standing outside the Memphis Country Club, the venue for Guy Pelly and Lizzy Wilson's rehearsal dinner when she was spoken to by officers.

Becky Heinecky, who was also there, told local station WREG: 'It was kind of scary. It was intimidating to see someone pulled out and specifically targeted.'

Security surrounding the princes has been tight since they arrived in the U.S.

When they visited Graceland, Elvis Presley's mansion, on Friday there was a ten vehicle motorcade just for the princes.

Questions have been asked about the cost to British taxpayers of keeping the princes safe while in Memphis, which is thought to be $84,000.

Although the cost of the trip itself is being met privately by the princes, they are accompanied round-the-clock by a team of around four taxpayer-funded officers from Scotland Yard’s Royalty Protection Squad.

Some of those will have traveled to Memphis in advance to ‘recce’ the private residence where they are staying and the wedding venue. Others traveled with the brothers personally.

One senior industry source estimated the cost of guarding the princes during their five-day trip would be in the region of $84,000, including business class flights and hotels for all of the officers.

But retired chief superintendent Dai Davies, former Head of Royal Protection, said: ‘William is a future king and his brother is fourth in line to the throne and serving member of the military which does, unfortunately, make them a major security risk.

'If we accept that we need to protect them 24 hours a day then that protection will, by necessity, extend to trips such as this.’
