The Duke of Edinburgh today joined the rest of the royal family for the New Year's Day church service.

Arriving on foot, Prince Philip smiled at well-wishers who applauded outside the Church of St. Mary Magdalene on the Royal estate at Sandringham at 11am.

About 300 members of the public watched as the Queen arrived in a Bentley but the Duke made the 400 metre walk from Sandringham house.

Home: The Duke was the first to leave the church and exchanged a few short New Year greetings with the public before walking back to the house alone, ahead of the rest of the royal party

There had been doubts whether the Duke would attend following his health scare which forced him to miss Christmas at Sandringham

Wearing a camel coat, the 90-year-old walked briskly as the royals entered the church.

There had been doubts whether the 
Duke would attend following his health scare which forced him to miss 
Christmas at Sandringham.

The Queen gave a reading during the 45-minute service.

Her reading was followed by hymns and prayers which were played over a public address system to the crowd outside.

Royal family: Sophie, Countess of Wessex and the Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex both attended the service

Safety: The public who turned up to catch a glimpse of the royal family were searched by police officers before entering the Sandringham estate

The Duke was the first to leave the church and exchanged a few short New Year greetings with the public before walking back to the house alone, ahead of the rest of the royal party.

The Queen collected flowers from about 40 children while the Earl and Countess of Wessex chatted to the crowd.

The Duke missed Christmas Day at Sandringham and the traditional Boxing Day shoot, which he normally leads.

He was admitted to Papworth Hospital, Cambridgeshire, on December 23 where doctors discovered a blocked artery.

On returning to Sandringham after a four night hospital stay, the Sunday Mirror reported the Duke was told to he must 
'take things easy.'

The newspaper reported that staff were informed that the Duke now exclusive use of a £1million lift at Sandringham so he can avoid climbing the steep staircases.

It was installed last year after the 
Queen found the stairs difficult due to knee pain, but it was mainly by 
servants to move luggage up to the bedrooms of the 270 room mansion.

A courtier told the newspaper: 'It’s only been working for a few weeks and this is the first Christmas it’s been available.

Back to the staircase: Staff at Sandringham were reportedly informed that the Duke now exclusive use of a £1million lift at Sandringham so he can avoid climbing the steep staircases

'The Queen made it clear that as she and the Duke got older, she did not want to be ferried around on a stairlift, which she considered to be undignified. 

'There was a small luggage lift at Sandringham, which was used by the staff to take bags up to rooms, but it could carry only one person at a time. The shaft was widened and the new lift can now carry eight people.'

'It cost around £1million but the royals consider it money well spent,' said the courtier.

'The only down side is that there is a sign in it saying ‘not for staff’ so the poor old porters now have to lug everything up the stairs.'

Prince Philip spent four nights in hospital after he was airlifted to Papworth Hospital from Sandringham complaining of chest pains. 

Following tests, doctors discovered a blocked artery and inserted a small surgical stent to open it up and restore the blood flow to his heart.

Although the procedure is relatively common and considered ‘minimally invasive’, doctors were taking no chances given his age and kept the prince in hospital for four nights – much to the notoriously grumpy royal’s displeasure.

The incident is the most serious health scare suffered by the duke since he was hospitalised with a serious chest infection in 2008.

On 27 December he was discharged from Papworth Hospital in Cambridgeshire shortly before 9.30am in a chauffeur-driven Range Rover and was driven back to Sandringham.

The Queen and Prince Philip normally stay at Sandringham until after 6 February each year – the anniversary of the death of the Queen's father, George VI, who died there in 1952 at the age of 56 after a day's shooting on the estate.

It is not clear yet whether any decisions had been made about his future engagements in what will be a busy year as the Queen celebrates her diamond jubilee with events across Britain during the spring and summer.
