If you had to choose, who would you least want to travel with?

According to a new survey, Britons have selected their in-laws as the worst possible holiday companion... with bosses and ex-partners not far behind.

And when it comes to the type of holiday they'd most like to avoid, many were quick to state that a cruise would be the absolute worst.

According to Britons polled by sunshine.co.uk, a cruise with in-laws would be their least desirable holiday

In the survey, conducted by sunshine.co.uk, camping and cottage or villa-style breaks were also listed as the worst type of holiday to go on if accompanied by their least favourite holidaymaker.

The online travel agency also found that two-thirds of those who said their in-laws were the worst possible holiday companion had, perhaps unsurprisingly, been on holiday with them before.

The poll was conducted as part of an ongoing study into the holiday habits of those around the UK.

Sunshine.co.uk polled 1,668 Britons, all of whom were aged 18 and over.

Is this you? Not likely! 54% of respondents replied that in-laws would make the worst holiday companions

1. In-laws - 54%

2. Bosses - 38%

3. Ex-Partners - 37%

4. Parents - 25%

5. Children - 19%  

Initially, all respondents were asked to provide details of their worst possible companion to travel with and those polled could select all answers that they felt were applicable. 

Those who selected in-laws were then asked to provide reasons for their choice.

The majority (45 per cent) said that they did not 'see eye-to-eye' with them, while 31 per cent noted that their 'preferred holiday activities would differ.'

Coming in close behind, those polled agreed that taking an ex-partner on holiday would be terrible as well

Twenty one per cent confessed that they simply 'would not be able to relax' if accompanied by their in-laws on holiday.

The survey then asked exactly what type of holiday would the absolute worst to go on with such an undesirable companion.

Fifty six per cent of respondents stated that a cruise would be the worst, while 27 per cent admitted that they'd least like to go camping.

Seventeen per cent agreed that a cottage or villa break together would be most unpleasant.

Another less than desirable travel partner? Your boss, according to 38 per cent of those surveyed

Chris Clark, Managing Director of sunshine.co.uk, said: 'We all know what it might be like to go on holiday with people who we think could be annoying; after all, there is little opportunity to escape.'

'The results do make for tough reading for those with sons or daughters in-law, as it appears that the old-fashioned jokes about the in-laws still ring true today.

'It's not surprising that holidays spent in close confinement are the least favoured, so there is still hope for having a holiday with the in-laws and enjoying it, so long as you each have your own space.

'As with anything, if you're planning a holiday with others, make sure you take into account everyone's tastes so no one feels they've missed out on having a great holiday.'
