Seized: Police said investigators found a Batman mask similar to this one inside the apartment of James Holmes

Police have seized a Batman mask, other Batman paraphernalia and a computer from the apartment of a man suspected of opening fire at a midnight premiere of The Dark Knight Rises in Colorado.

According to an official, a Batman poster was also hanging on a wall in James Holmes’ 850-square-foot apartment in Aurora.

The discoveries were made after authorities finished clearing the 24-year-old’s home of booby traps and ammunition which he had allegedly left inside with the suspected intent to kill.

It has been reported that Holmes told police he was the Joker, referring to the character played by Heath Ledger in the 2008 hit film The Dark Knight. 

The official said a computer that was  confiscated from the apartment could aid the effort to determine how long Holmes had been planning the attack and other details of the massacre.

Holmes was arrested early Friday morning after authorities said he set off gas canisters inside a packed theater and shot unsuspecting movie-goers in an attack that killed 12 people and injured 58 others.

A law enforcement source said when the killer rushed into the theater and opened fire, he encountered a technical glitch. Police said the alleged gunman came in armed with three weapons: a Remington shotgun, a Smith & Wesson M&P assault rifle and a Glock .40-caliber handgun.

The assault rifle, which is similar to an AR-15 and is a civilian version of the military’s M-16, could fire 50 to 60 rounds per minute and is designed to hold large ammunition magazines. The source said that Holmes allegedly had obtained a 100-round drum magazine that attached to the weapon but that such large magazines are notorious for jamming, according to the Washington Post.

The law enforcement official said 
authorities think the gunman first used the shotgun — some victims have 
buckshot wounds — and then began using the assault rifle, which jammed. 
Then he resorted to the handgun.

Aurora
 Police Chief Dan Oates, interviewed on 'Fox News Sunday,' did not 
confirm or deny that the gun jammed but said police found a 100-round 
magazine on the theater floor. He said he did not know whether it was 
empty.

Some of the wounded victims interviewed by the press also said that the suspect's weapon jammed.

Law enforcement officials revealed 
that Holmes has not been cooperating with them and that it could take 
months to learn what prompted the attack.

Holmes was being held in solitary 
confinement at a Denver-area county detention facility, Aurora Police 
Chief Dan Oates said, and is ‘lawyered up.’

‘He's
 not talking to us,’ the chief said. He is scheduled for an initial 
hearing Monday, and has been assigned a public defender.

Meanwhile, University of Colorado 
officials were looking on Sunday into whether Holmes used his position 
in a graduate program to collect hazardous materials, but school 
officials did not say whether they knew the suspect in a movie 
theater massacre was anything more than a hard-working student.

While the University of Colorado disclosed that it was cooperating with police in the case, that disclosure was one of the few the university has made three days after the massacre.

It remained unclear whether Holmes' professors and other students at his 35-student PhD program noticed anything unusual about his behavior.

His reasons for quitting the program in June, just a year into the five- to seven-year program, also remained a mystery.

Holmes recently took an intense, three-part oral exam that marks the end of the first year. Those who do well continue with their studies and shift to full-time research, while those who don't do well meet with advisers and discuss their options, including retaking the exam.

University officials would not say if he passed, citing privacy concerns.

The university declined to release any details of his academic record, citing privacy concerns, and at least two dozen professors and other staff declined to speak.

Risky: Although police had cleared Holmes' apartment of booby traps and have finished collecting evidence, residents are still not allowed back into the building because of chemical hazards

Some said they were instructed not to talk publicly about Holmes in a blanket email sent to university employees.

Jacque Montgomery, a spokeswoman for the University of Colorado medical school, said that police have told the school to not talk about Holmes. The university also took down the website for its graduate neuroscience program on Saturday.

Police have finished collecting evidence from the apartment where the Colorado shooting suspect lived, but residents are still not allowed back into the building because of chemical hazards.

Aurora police said Sunday residents can retrieve personal items, but the building remains closed.
