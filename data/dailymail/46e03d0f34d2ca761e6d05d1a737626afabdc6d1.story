Lewis Hamilton and Arsene Wenger joined forces on Tuesday night at a glitzy gala in Geneva.

Hamilton, the reigning Formula One champion, and Wenger, the Arsenal manager who oversaw his side’s 2-0 victory at Manchester City on Sunday, posed together at the 75th anniversary of the Swiss watch manufacturer IWC Shaffhausen.

Arsenal-supporting Hamilton, boasting a new hair-do, and Wenger, were joined by a host of celebrities from the world of showbiz and sport.

Also among the famous faces gathered at the Swiss gala were actress Emily Blunt, Czech model and former Victoria's Secret Angel Karolina Kurkova.

Hamilton’s Mercedes team-mate and rival for last year’s title Nico Rosberg was also among the high-profile attendees at the Geneva event.

Hamilton and Rosberg went toe-to-toe for the F1 championship in 2014 last year, with the Briton coming up trumps in the season decider at Abu Dhabi.

The pair are expected to renew their rivalry in 2015 and will take the wraps off their Mercedes W06 challenger on the morning of the first pre-season test in Jerez on February 1.

Both drivers appeared in relaxed mood at the IWC party; the Swiss watch manufacturer an official partner of the Mercedes F1 team.

Arsenal boss Wenger will have been buoyed by his side’s strong display at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday and his side will be looking to build on that performance when they host Brighton this weekend.

Czech model Karolina Kurkova, best known for her time as a Victoria's Secret Angel was also at the gala
