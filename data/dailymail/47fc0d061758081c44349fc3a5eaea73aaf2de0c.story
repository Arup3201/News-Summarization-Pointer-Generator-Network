An advertising campaign by Puma has run into embarrassing difficulties after social media pranksters made it look as if a number of world famous sports stars had written crude personalised messages.

As part of the sportswear brand's latest promotional campaign, Twitter users were encouraged to tweet the hashtag #ForeverFaster, which would then automatically generate a 'personalised message' signed by one of Puma's famous brand ambassadors.

But as soon as Twitter wags realised the messages were based on their profile details, they began making subtle alterations to make it look as if superstars such as Usain Bolt, Radamel Falcao and Cesc Fabregas had written offensive messages.

Not what they want to read: Radamel Falcao's 'personalised message' said that 'Liverpool are w***'

Bad taste: Cesc Fabregas's 'personalised' photograph was changed to read a crude message

Among the famous names embarrassed by pranksters was Monaco's Colombian striker Falcao.

With the footballer apparently just days away from sealing a mega-money move to Liverpool, one Arsenal fan did his best to sour any future relationship with fans of the Anfield club.

Simply by changing his Twitter profile name, the unidentified user was automatically sent a signed photograph that read: 'Liverpool are w****. Never stop believing, Falcao.'

Another footballer made to look highly offensive by Twitter users was Cesc Fabregas, whose 'personalized' photograph was changed to read: 'I spread Ebola. Appreciate your support, Cesc.' 

Immature: The prank was not just reserved for high-profile footballers - even Usain Bolt was caught out

Wrong: Borussia Dortmund's Marco Reus had his 'personalised' Puma message altered too

The prank was not just reserved for high-profile footballers, however - even the fastest man in the world was caught out by the hijinks. 

A photograph that appeared to be signed by Usain Bolt was changed to read: 'I'm erect. Forget the pack, follow your instincts.'

Despite inadvertently offending their fans around the world, Liverpool are understood to remain keen on signing Falcao - although they are expected to face tough competition from Juventus.

The Italians are apparently in favour of a loan deal and are considering the sale of Fernando Llorente to Valencia - although the Spaniard is not overly keen.

Real Madrid also maintain an interest in Falcao but would need to sell another non-EU player before being allowed to sign the Colombian.
