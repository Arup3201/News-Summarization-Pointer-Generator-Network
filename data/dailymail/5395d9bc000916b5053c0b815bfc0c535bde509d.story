Alan Pardew will start work at Crystal Palace without his right-hand man Andy Woodman after it emerged he is still at Newcastle United.

Pardew wants Woodman, a former Palace youth-team keeper, with him at Selhurst Park as part of his technical team but Newcastle want to keep the respected goalkeeping coach.

Palace still claim to be working on the final details of Pardew's appointment as manager and he has been discussing potential new arrivals with chairman Steve Parish.

Age: 43 (DOB: 11/08/71)

Position: Goalkeeping coach (Newcastle United, 2010-)

Previous jobs with Pardew: West Ham United (2006-07), Charlton Athletic (2007-10) 

Clubs played for: Crystal Palace (1989-94), Exeter City (1994-95), Northampton Town (1995-99), Brentford (1999, loan), Brentford (1999-2001), Peterborough United (2000, loan), Southend United (2000, loan), Colchester United (2000, loan), Colchester United (2001-02), Oxford United (2002, loan), Oxford United (2002-04), Stevenage Borough (2004-05), Redbridge (2005), Thurrock (2005), Rushden & Diamonds (2005-06)

Woodman has worked with Pardew at three different clubs - Newcastle, West Ham United (2006-07) and Charlton Athletic (2007) - and is regarded as one of the ex-Southampton boss' most-trusted lieutenants.

Although Sportsmail initially understood the compensation figure for Pardew was £2million, sources at Newcastle claim it is £4m.

Pardew is believed to have already met the existing coaching staff, Keith Millen and Ben Garner, on Wednesday night as they prepared Palace for the trip to face Aston Villa on Thursday.

His initial plan was to be in the dugout but the delay in formally announcing him as the new Palace manager means he is more likely to watch the game from the stands.

Newcastle goalkeeping coach Woodman is the father of Freddie Woodman, the club's 17-year-old stopper, and that could be a factor in determining whether or not he wishes to relocate back to his home area - just as Pardew has done.
