Her lengthy CV lists countless qualifications, civic achievements, books and publications – but Raquel Rolnik makes no mention of dabbling in witchcraft.

Yet the architect and urban planner appears to be an avid follower of Candomble, an African-Brazilian religion that originated during the slave trade.

The academic, brought up a Marxist, actually offered an animal sacrifice to Karl Marx when she was studying for her Masters degree in architecture so ‘he would leave her alone’ to study in peace.

According to her elder sister Suely, a well-known Brazilian psychoanalyst and intellectual, Raquel had become ‘contaminated’ by other philosophies and offered the sacrifice to appease the German revolutionary socialist.

The UN special rapporteur’s fascination with Candomble rekindled memories of another controversial figure’s links with the religion that worships African gods.

In 2001, Peter Mandelson was ridiculed when reports emerged that his Brazilian partner, Reinaldo Avila da Silva, had engaged a Candomble witch doctor to put a hex on political enemies in a ceremony involving the slaughter of a chicken. 

It was claimed that the Labour spin doctor – now a peer – held a live chicken by the neck while a priest in Rio de Janeiro cut off its head, splashing Mr Mandelson with blood.

Mother-of-two Mrs Rolnik lives in Sao Paulo, Brazil’s biggest city, and is a professor at the city university’s faculty of Architecture and Urbanism.

Her Polish grandfather died in the Holocaust and her parents emigrated to Brazil. She has held various government positions, speaks six languages, and was appointed to her UN post in 2008.

In an interview, her sister Suely gave more clues about Raquel’s upbringing and background. She said: ‘My little sister –  who is much younger than me – and I have always felt the same.

MPs pointed out that in Brazil tens of millions of people are condemned to living in shanty towns, or favelas

'I was born in Belenzinho [a poor area of Sao Paulo], my parents are immigrants and we never tried to hide this, we do not feel well in high class, bourgeois places.

‘She was always brilliant academically. So she wanted to show that these forms of housing, including tenement houses, favela housing etc, aren’t the only solutions to poverty. She wanted to show that there were other alternatives.

‘She lived in communes at the time, she went to Africa, the Caribbean, Colombia, she went to the houses of African witch doctors to find out what was the memory of housing in Africa, during slavery. But the university didn’t accept her thesis.

‘I greatly admire her work, her courage, the work she is doing with the UN is fantastic, she is very precocious.’ 

Suely said Raquel came to live with her in Paris in the 1970s and became interested in French philosophers.

‘When she went to do her Masters, she offered an ebo – an animal sacrifice – to Marx, so he would leave her in peace.

‘Because, as well as having a Marxist formation at the university, when we were small our parents put us in the Leftist Zionist movement.

‘Raquel had a really solid Marxist formation. So she had to give an ebo to Marx in Candomble so he would leave her alone.’
