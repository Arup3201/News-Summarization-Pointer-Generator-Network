More than 300,000 of the poorest people in Britain have no free-use cash machines within 1km from their homes, it was revealed today.

There are 269 low-income areas with no free ATMs inside a 1km (0.6-mile) radius – with half of the most excluded people living in South Wales and the North.

Labour MP Frank Field, who advises the Government on combating poverty, said the charges - which  range from 75p to £10 - are ‘a rip-off that makes [payday lender] Wonga look like Santa Claus’.

‘Getting the poor to pay for the privilege of taking out their own money is a grotesque practice,’ he told The Guardian, which obtained the figures from the Link network, behind Britain's ATMs.

Mr Field added that the people who relied on cash machines charging a flat fee were often poor - meaning they were disproportionately affected for taking out small amounts of cash.

More than 7million people now rely only on cash for all regular payments - a figure up 500,000 on 2011 - and there are now more than 66,000 cash machines in the UK, reported The Guardian.

Britons used cash machines 2.9billion times in 2011 to withdraw a total of more than £190billion.

Supermarkets and new companies now process more than half of cash machine transactions - a vastly different picture to the situation a decade ago when banks provided nearly all ATM services.

A spokesman for Link said 900 ATMs had been installed since 2006, when 1,700 low-income areas had no free-use machines within them or within 1km of their centre.

The body’s chief executive John Howells told The Guardian:  ‘If lower-income people were forced to use surcharging machines then this would be a clear hardship and not tenable.

‘However, Link's evidence is that this is not the case and most people can access cash on a free basis.’
