Indonesian authorities have vowed to scrap virginity tests for female civil servants following international outrage that the country's police force is continuing to use the 'outdated and degrading' practice.

Human Rights Watch (HRW) last month launched a scathing attack on the country's lawmakers after it interviewed multiple women within the police force who were subjected to the examination.

While the country's police force is yet to relent on its use of the test, Home Affairs Minister Tjahjo Kumolo has announced aspiring civil servants and public administrators will no longer be required to undergo it.

The minister announced the practice would stop at the Institute of Public Administration - a leading school for civil servants - saying it was a 'pity' that a woman could fail the test despite being competent for the job, The Bangkok Post reported, based on a report by the Kompas Daily.

His announcement is a minor victory for those hoping to see the practice outlawed following last month's HRW report on its use by the Indonesian police force.

In order to become a policewoman, a candidate must be aged 17.5 to 22 years, follow a religion, be at least 5ft, 5in, not need glasses and be a virgin.

However, according to a report by HRW, a number of applicants were only told of the test moments before it was about to take place.

'I felt embarrassed, nervous, but I couldn't refuse, ' an applicant told the HRW according to GlobalPost. 'If I had refused, I couldn't have become a policewoman.'

According to another female applicant, the tests have seen the aspiring police officers undress in front of 20 other candidates before being led into a room without a door, in pairs.

There, in the company of the other applicants, the women were subjected to internal examinations to determine if they were virgins.

'The Indonesian National Police's use of virginity tests is a discriminatory practice that harms and humiliates women,' said Nisha Varia, associate women's rights director at HRW.

Human Rights Watch said the practice was 'degrading' and 'discriminatory' and called for it to be banned from use. File image used

'Applicants who failed the test were not necessarily expelled from the force, but women described the test as painful and traumatic.'

The practice, which is supposed to determine if the candidate's hymen is intact, has been widely discredited as unscientific and degrading.

A spokesman for the national police confirmed virginity tests still happened but that there was no requirement for female candidates to be virgins.

'There is a complete health test for both female and male candidates including checking reproductive organs and the virginity test for women will be a part of that routine.

'But there has never has been a rule that requires policewomen to be virgins, so there is no discrimination.'

Authorities claim the virginity test allows them to check candidates are healthy and free of diseases such as cervical cancer.
