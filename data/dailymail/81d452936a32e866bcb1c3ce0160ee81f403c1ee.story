With the Clasico debut of Luis Suarez now less than a month away the operation to get him fully fit to start against Real Madrid is well underway. Unfortunately, so too is the campaign to undermine him.

A Madrid-based television channel called him ‘overweight’ and accused the Uruguayan of looking like an ‘ex-footballer’ in its lunchtime bulletin on Thursday. The Catalan press hit back on Friday morning saying: 'He scores two goals in a friendly and already they are scared of him.'

Suarez’s double against an Indonesian Under-19 XI on Wednesday was the highlight of his first competitive 90 minutes since the World Cup. He now has 29 days to get ready for what could be one of the most spectacular Barcelona debuts in history – few players get to play their first games for the club against the old enemy at the Santiago Bernabeu.

Luis Suarez has been labelled 'overweight' by the Madrid press as he draws near the end of his suspension. His first match back will be Barcelona's Clasico clash with Real at the Bernabeu on October 24

Under the watchful eye of fitness coach Juanjo Brau Suarez, Suarez has been building his fitness since July but was forced to do so far from the club’s Joan Gamper training complex.

Now with the ban lifted the clandestine gym and road work have been replaced by the arduous training sessions of coach Luis Enrique – himself a triathlon nut determined to make this Barca as fit as the team coached to 14 trophies in four years by Pep Guardiola.

Luis Enrique said in his press conference: 'Suarez, fat? He is a naturally stocky player. He is at his ideal weight and he is ready to compete. If you want we'll give him liposuction but I don't think he needs it.' 

Suarez has worked tirelessly on his musculature – a process that started when he had to build strength around his injured left knee to make it to the Brazil World Cup. Now he needs to add that lightness of turn and burst of pace that only full matches can bring.

Suarez was unveiled as a Barcelona player back in August but is suspended until late October

Following Wednesday’s friendly he will now play two more games ahead of the trip to Madrid on October 24.

Uruguay play against Saudi Arabia and Oman on October 10 and 13 respectively, with Suarez expected to play the 90 minutes in both games. That will benefit him hugely before his big kick-off and the Uruguayan FA. who will earn over a million euros from the games, twice what they would have earned without the former Liverpool striker in the team.

The 5-0 win over Indonesia showed what Barcelona – who later on Wednesday failed to register a single shot on target in a 0-0 draw with Malaga – are missing. And despite the ‘ex-footballer’ jibe that came his way the following day most Barcelona fans were sufficiently impressed with his workout and two goals.

The car is out of the garage and the engine is running – now it's time for the fine tuning to make sure he starts on the grid against Pepe, Sergio Ramos and company in four weeks time.
