A Washington cold case of a missing boy has been all but solved, police announced Tuesday, now that a man already in prison for stabbing to death his wife, has confessed to killing his toddler son in 1983.

Stanley Guidroz told police from a Louisiana prison that he 'just lost it' on his fussing son Wallace all those years ago. He says he smacked the 3-year-old to the ground, where he hit his head and died.

Guidroz confessed he then buried the toddler in a shallow waterside grave in Tacoma before calling police to say the boy had gone missing.

Cold case solved: Stanley Guidroz says he got away with the murder of his 3-year-old son Wallace for 31 years. The 57-year-old was charged with the 1983 slaying on Tuesday after Guidroz finally confessed

Shallow grave: Here, Tacoma Police detective Brian Vold starts a second hole during the search for the remains of Wallace Guidroz   in Washington in 2011 after Guidroz drove his Mustang, along with the body of the wife he stabbed, to a Louisiana police station and confessed. The confession suggested to police that Guidroz may have also killed his son who went missing in 1983, but his confession wouldn't come for 3 years

It was a family the father and son had met while fishing that January day, Guildroz told police, who he believed kidnapped the boy.

Police never found a family matching the description Guildroz gave, and he remained a suspect himself, but a body was never found and Guildroz would quietly slip out of Washington by the following year.

His shadow would never again darken the Evergreen State and nearly 30 years would pass before police got a break in the heartbreaking case.

Fast-forward to 2011, and a glimmer of that break would finally come as Detective Gene Miller of the Tacoma Police Department's Cold Case Unit reviewed the case.

Miller chose to reopen the case when he found inconsistencies in Guidroz's statements to police, according to a Pierce County Prosecutor's Office release.

Miller tracked Guidroz to Louisiana, where he was in prison for manslaughter after stabbing to death his wife--not Wallace's mother--and driving around with her body in the car until confessing in a nearby police station.

'Child killer': Police reopened Wallace's case after Guidroz stabbed to death his wife Pepettra (left) then drove around with her body in the back of his '99 Mustang for hours before confessing at a Louisiana police station. He eventually confessed that he killed Wallace, but covered up that crime for fear of being labeled a 'child killer' in prison

31-year-old cold case: It was eventually Guidroz's confession from a Louisiana prison, where he's serving time for murdering his wife--who was not Wallace's mother--and not a discovery of a body that led authorities to finally charge Guidroz. Wallace's remains were never found

The 2011 murder of Pepettra Guidroz is likely what spurred Washington police to reopen Wallace's ice cold case.

Miller would hear several more versions of Guidroz's story before hearing the jarring truth, according to WWL.

Guidroz said he simply 'lost it' while feeding his fussy son in a high chair and a backhanded slap was all it took to leave Wallace lifeless on the floor.

So why didn't Guidroz's guilt get the best of him then, as it did when he'd later kill his wife?

He told police he was more afraid of being labeled in prison as a 'child killer.'

Soon, though, he'll likely be labeled that in spite of himself.

'This is another success for the Cold Case Unit,' said Prosecutor Mark Lindquist. 'Justice matters, no matter how long it takes.' 

A warrant has been issued for his  return to Washington state, where he'll answer to a manslaughter charge in the first degree for taking the life of his own son. 

Truth emerging: Back in 1983, Guidroz told police that a family he'd met while fishing with Wallace here at Point Defiance Park were likely the missing boys kidnappers. In fact, Guidroz now says he'd killed the boy and buried him here in a shallow grave
