Main Sequence, who failed to land a race in nine British starts after finishing second to Camelot in the 2012 Derby, narrowly denied Europe a first win at the Breeders’ Cup at Santa Anita on Saturday as he held off France’s Flintshire in the $3million Turf.

It was a fourth grade one win since crossing the Atlantic for the Niarchos family-owned chestnut, whose lack of success in Britain led to him being gelded before leaving Lambourn trainer David Lanigan to join English-based US trainer Graham Motion.

Motion said: ‘The race set up beautifully. This horse is a machine. He’s really suited to American racing and he just gets better and better. He’s a very impressive horse.

Andre Fabre’s Arc runner-up Flintshire briefly looked like he had made a winning move until cut down in the final strides and lose out by half a length.

Fourth, beaten just over two lengths, was Sir Michael Stoute’s Telescope, the colt part-owned by Sir Alex Ferguson.

He was a place in front of Aidan O’Brien’s Chicquita while Michael Owen-owned, Tom Dascombe-trained Brown Panther faded after racing prominently to finish 11th of the 12 starters.

Stoute said of Telescope, who will stay in training next year, said: ‘He’s run a good race, but the race wasn’t really run to suit him. He needs to be able to do it one long progression. He’s a long striding horse for a track like this.’

With only two races remaining, the best Europe had managed at the 31st Breeders’ Cup was the third of Richard Hannon’s Osaila in Friday’s Juvenile Filly Turf and the third of Charlie Hills-trained Just The Judge in yesterday’s Filly & Mare Turf behind all-the-way Chad Brown-trained winner Daysatthespa.

Stoute’s defending champion Dank, the 7-4 favourite, now heads into retirement after finishing fourth in that race.

Stoute a felt the race had not unfolded right for her.

He said: ‘They didn’t go fast enough in the middle part of the race for her.’

Aidan O’Brien’s The Great War was unplaced behind wide-margin winner Texas Red in the Juvenile while David Simcock’s Caspar Netscher failed to land a blow on Bobby’s Kitten in the Turf Sprint.

The second Brown-trained winner of day two of the meeting, who narrowly denied Frankie Dettori’s mount No Nay Never, could be heading to Royal Ascot next year.

Dettori had won his 11th Breeders’ Cup race on US-trained Hootenanny in Friday’s Juvenile Turf.
