Arrested: James Allen, 36, vanished after Colin Dunford, 81, and Julie Davison, 50, were found battered to death in their homes in Middlesbrough and Whitby last week

A fugitive who apparently went missing following the discovery of two bodies 30 miles apart has been charged with double murder.

James Allen vanished after Colin Dunford, 81, and Julie Davison, 50, were found battered to death in their homes in Middlesbrough and Whitby last week.

Detectives launched a three-day nationwide manhunt, that ended in his arrest in Leeds on Sunday.

He has now been charged with two counts of murder, rape, false imprisonment, assault and witness intimidation.

He appeared at Teesside Magistrates' Court this morning, where a judge remanded him in custody until tomorrow when he will appear at crown court.

Mr Dunford, who was last seen alive at
around 5pm last Sunday, was found dead with serious head injuries at 
his terraced house in Leven Street, Middlesbrough, on Monday after he 
failed to appear at Samuelsons Working Man's Club, where he was a daily 
visitor.

Detectives said there was no sign of forced entry at the house.

Ms Davison, who lived alone, was found
dead by her sister at her rented flat in Church Square on Wednesday. She had also suffered serious head injuries, police said.

It was not until the following Sunday that he 36-year-old suspect was recognised in the centre of Leeds at 7.20am by a policeman driving to work to start his shift.

He
immediately called for back-up and continued to watch Allen from his 
car. A small team of officers arrived ‘within minutes’ and they moved in
to make the arrest.

Detective
Chief Superintendent Gordon Lang, of Cleveland Police, said there was a
short chase on foot before Allen was held, handcuffed and taken for 
questioning.

Mr Lang expressed concern on Sunday about the suspect’s movements over the past few days.

‘It’s very important to fill in the details of where he has been and who he has come across,’ the police chief said.

‘If
you haven’t seen or heard from your neighbour lately or you notice 
anything unusual about their house, please pay them a visit to check up 
on them.’
