Gunmen have shot dead a female member of an anti-polio vaccination team in Pakistan and left another worker critically injured.

The team were working in Kaga Wala village in Badbher area in the suburbs of Peshawar.

It has been reported that two people on a motorbike opened fire on the team as it was administering polio drops.

It is the latest in a spate of attacks on vaccination workers.

American agents who tracked and killed Osama Bin Laden last year used a polio vaccination campaign as cover while they carried out their mission.

It has since given the Taliban reason to distrust anyone linked to the anti-polio campaigns.

While no group has yet said it carried out the Peshawar killing, in the 
past the Pakistan Taliban has accused vaccination teams of being 
American spies and of sterilising children with the vaccine.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has announced temporary suspension of anti-polio activities after the latest incident, Dawn.com reports.

Peshawar Habibullah Arif,  WHO assistant Commissioner, said that a complete halt of the campaign had not yet been ordered. He said it would be continuing in other areas of Peshawar. 

The Polio vaccinators were on duty when they were attacked by the unidentified gunmen, who killed one of them and injured the other.

Dr Raheem Khatta, in charge of the vaccination programme, told the site the Deputy Commissoner of Peshawar would decide what to do now.

It is believed the polio team was without the security guards at the time.

The women were taken to Lady Reading Hospital in Peshawar. One of the women died from her injuries, while the second is in a critical condition. 

It is believed the attackers escaped on foot. Security forces cordoned off the site of attack as an investigation was launched.

At least eight people who were working with polio vaccination teams were shot dead in Karachi and the north-west in December, the BBC reports.

In January, February and April three police officers accompanying vaccine workers were killed in similar attacks.

Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria are the only countries where polio is endemic.
