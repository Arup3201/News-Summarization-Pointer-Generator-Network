Hobart 'Hobie' Alter, who helped popularize surfing and sailing with the development of the foam surfboard and the 'Hobie Cat' sailboat, has died aged 80.

Alter passed away on Saturday at his Palm Desert home, according to a statement on the Hobie sporting goods website. A cause of death was not disclosed.

The Orange County Register said he had been battling cancer, which he was diagnosed with about five years ago.

'He wanted to make a living without having to wear hard-soled shoes or work east of California's Pacific Coast Highway,' the statement said.

'By 'making people a toy and giving 
them a game to play with it' he was able to realize this dream. And in 
the process, he introduced the world to an outdoor lifestyle and 
collection of products that made things just a bit more fun for all of 
us.'

A true ocean lover, Alter was a champion surfer who conquered the Makaha International Surf Contest in 1958 and 1959, and won a trio of tandem surfing championships from 1961-’63.

But Alter’s legacy will always be as surfboard and sailboat production pioneer.

He was dubbed 'the Henry Ford of the surfboard industry' by Steve Pezman for his contribution to the large-scale manufacture of surfboards.

The self-taught innovator and surfer 
had his start in the early 1950s carving wooden surfboards in the garage
 of his family's Laguna Beach home.

When
 the balsa wood used for the boards became scarce, he and his friend 
Gordon 'Grubby' Clark created surfboards out of polyurethane foam.

The
 boards were durable, but had better flexibility and were less expensive
 than wooden boards. The invention revolutionized surfing, and Hobie 
became a top surfboard brand.

Clark went on to launch Clark Foam, which
 had a virtual monopoly on the unshaped foam blocks that were used for 
custom-made boards.

In the late 60s, Alter turned his focus to sailing and designed a lightweight sailboat inspired by the twin-hulled Polynesian catamaran.

The more affordable Hobie Cat, which could be launched from the beach, is credited with bringing high-performance sailing to the masses.

For his contribution to the sport, Alter was inducted into the National Sailing Hall of Fame in 2011.

He was survived by his wife, Susan, a daughter and two sons.
