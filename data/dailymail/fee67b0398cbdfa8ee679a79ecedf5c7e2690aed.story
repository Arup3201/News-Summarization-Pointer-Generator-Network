Digital currencies like Bitcoin are fast becoming the weapon of choice for divorcing spouses trying to hide wealth from partners during court battles, it has emerged.

A number of forums devoted to Bitcoin have been filled with husbands discussing the option of using digital currencies, a London divorce lawyer has claimed. 

It comes as courts are facing more legal 
battles from divorcing spouses who claim the other side has tried to 
conceal their wealth.

It is feared that spouses 
could use Bitcoin to hide wealth by transferring the currency between online 
wallets, to friends, or to areas outside of legal jurisdiction.

New weapon: Digital currencies such as Bitcoin are fast becoming the weapon of choice for divorcing spouses trying to hide currency from their partners

Ayesha
 Vardag said that more divorce lawyers could start including digital 
currency in financial disclosure orders if there is evidence they have 
been used.

She told the Financial Times: 'They
 can be used to run a parallel economy.

'People will go to 
immense lengths... as a spousal claim is more damaging than tax 
because it is half your wealth.'

Frank Arndt, head of international 
family law at Stowe Family Law, also told the paper that Bitcoins may need to be disclosed as an asset in divorce cases.

He said: 'Husbands are 
becoming more and more creative in terms of what they do to reduce their
 wealth and the courts are struggling to catch up. It’s just like when 
the internet started and it was difficult for courts to catch up.'

Bitcoin is an entirely virtual currency that works without the need for a central bank, and can be sent over the internet.

Coins
 are transferred directly from person to person and are kept in a 
digital wallet that can be accessed on a computer or mobile device.

Creating 
new coins is done through a process called 'mining' where users are 
rewarded with new coins for verifying transactions that take place.

The
 process is open source and can therefore be used by anyone, with more 
and more mainstream businesses now accepting the currency as a form of 
payment.

Courts in California are already beginning to 
issue search and discovery orders of assets - including digital 
currencies such as Bitcoin.

What is a bitcoin?

Bitcoins are just lines of computer code that are digitally signed each time they travel from one owner to the next. They are the basic unit of a new online economy which runs independently of any company, bank, or government. Because
 Bitcoins allow people to trade money without a third party getting 
involved, they have become popular with libertarians as well as 
technophiles, speculators — and criminals.

Who's behind the currency?

It's
 a mystery. Bitcoin was launched in 2009 by a person or group of people 
operating under the name Satoshi Nakamoto and then adopted by a small 
clutch of enthusiasts. Nakamoto
 dropped off the map as Bitcoin began to attract widespread attention, 
but proponents say that doesn't matter; the currency obeys its own, 
internal logic.What's a bitcoin worth?Like
 any other currency, Bitcoins are only worth as much as you and your 
counterpart want them to be. In its early days, boosters swapped Bitcoins back and forth for minor favors or just as a game. One website 
even gave them away for free. As the market matured, the value of each Bitcoin grew. At its height three months ago, a single Bitcoin was 
valued at $1,200. On Tuesday, it was around $500.Is the currency widely used?That's
 debatable. Businesses ranging from blogging platform Wordpress to 
retailer Overstock have jumped on the Bitcoin bandwagon amid a flurry of
 media coverage, but it's not clear whether the currency has really 
taken off. On the one 
hand, leading Bitcoin payment processor BitPay works with more than 
20,000 businesses — roughly five times more than it did last year. On
 the other, the total number of Bitcoin transactions has stayed roughly 
constant at between 60,000 and 70,000 per day over the same period, 
according to Bitcoin wallet site blockchain.info.Is Bitcoin particularly vulnerable to counterfeiting?The Bitcoin network works by harnessing individuals' greed for the collective good. A
 network of tech-savvy users called miners keep the system honest by 
pouring their computing power into a blockchain, a global running tally 
of every bitcoin transaction. The
 blockchain prevents rogues from spending the same bitcoin twice, and 
the miners are rewarded for their efforts by being gifted with the 
occasional Bitcoin. As long as miners keep the blockchain secure, counterfeiting shouldn't be an issue.
