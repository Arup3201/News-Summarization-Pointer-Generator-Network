An independent audio expert believes that George Zimmerman is most likely the harrowing voice screaming for help in the crucial 911 call made seconds before Trayvon Martin was shot dead.

As attorney's convene back in court in Florida today to continue a hearing to determine whether jurors will even listen to the phone call - this new revelation significantly bolsters Zimmerman's claim of self-defense.

ABC News exclusively obtained a sample of the distressing emergency call - which could prove pivotal once the trial of 29-year-old Zimmerman begins - and sent it to Kent Gibson of Forensic Audio.

In his expert opinion, a comparison of Martin's voice, Zimmerman's voice and the screaming on the 911 call indicate that the voice is 'more likely to be Zimmerman than Martin by a significant margin.'

ABC News explained they were able to finally make their startling but qualified judgement on the identity of the voice after they exclusively obtained a recording of Trayvon Martin's voice.

To ID any audio, forensic experts need samples of both Zimmerman and Martin's voice - and ABC provided their expert with a cellphone recording of Martin laughing and talking about two men arguing over a bike.

However, he adds the disclaimer that there is so much howling and pleading on the tape that only two seconds are usable in his opinion - therefore he says, there is no definitive identification of 'the screamer'.

In court this morning, the first witness, Tom Owen, a New Jersey based voice expert who listened to the recording for the Orlando Sentinel last year, ruled out Zimmerman as the voice.

He told the hearing that in 300 court appearances before today, he had never failed to qualify his opinion as expert.

Concurring with ABC News' expert, Owen played the court the 'usable' footage and then played publicly available samples of Zimmerman's voice.

'The screams don't match Zimmerman at all,' said Owen.

However, defense attorney Don West attacked Owen's credentials, asking why he claimed to have been an audio expert for 50 years, when that would mean he began his career as a teenager.

Owen replied that he produced weddings from the age of 15 and began work in voice identification in the early 1980s.

The FBI's forensic audio expert told the hearing on Thursday that he found it 'disturbing' that the court would want to admit evidence where no one can positively determine who is screaming.

Indeed, almost to prove this point, he pointed to one expert whose testimony was submitted as evidence in which he says he can hear Martin saying 'I'm begging you' moments before he is shot.

One other witness claims he can hear the screams come from Martin, while another says Zimmerman.

Today's final hearing before the trial begins next week argues that the science involved in picking out certain parts of audio is inadmissible.

However, the state, who contend the voice is of Trayvon Martin believe their audio experts prove the audio is credible evidence.

Shawn Vincent, spokesman for Zimmerman's lawyer Mark O'Mara, told ABC News, "That 911 call will get played in court. It is an important piece of evidence that will be played for the jury to make up their mind."

'The 911 call is probably the best evidence of what happened that night besides George Zimmerman's testimony and Trayvon's,' said legal analyst Bill Schaefer to ABC News, who noted Martin wouldn't be able to testify explaining his version of what happened.

Yesterday, George Zimmerman revealed his dramatic weight gain during his latest court appearance today as a judge denied his attorney's request to let some witnesses testify in private.

Photographs taken inside the courtroom show the former neighborhood watch officer is drastically heavier than he was in mugshots taken after he gunned down Trayvon Martin last year.

Zimmerman, who has been in hiding since his arrest, appeared in court on Thursday as his lawyer asked the judge for some witnesses to give their testimony out of the public eye.

Defense attorney Mark O'Mara said the witnesses have concerns for their safety about testifying at Zimmerman's trial, which starts next week.

O'Mara said that the seven witnesses he wanted to keep hidden include one eyewitness to the altercation between Zimmerman and Martin on the night of February 26, 2012.

He said their testimony could impact the jury's decision, but prosecutors and attorneys for media groups objected to the request.

Prosecutor John Guy had opposed the request, explaining it might be 'alarming and confusing to a juror and might otherwise highlight their testimony when it shouldn’t be highlighted'.

O'Mara also called Ben Kruidbos, a former IT director in the state prosecutor's office, to the stand.

The defense claims Kruidbos is a whistleblower who revealed deleted texts, photographs, and video found on the teenager's phone which prosecutors failed to disclose to the defense.

The information includes Martin possibly holding a gun and smoking marijuana.

With the photos and text messages, Zimmerman's attorneys hope to show 
that Martin wasn't the 'angel' he's been made out to be by his family, 
attorneys, and the media, but rather an experienced fighter who used 
drugs.

O'Mara also told the judge that Martin's marijuana use and past fighting
was central to the argument that Zimmerman used self-defense when he 
confronted Martin last year at a gated community in Sanford, Florida.

'We have a lot of evidence that marijuana use had something to do with 
the event,' O'Mara said. 'It could have affected his behavior.'

But the judge ruled that the photos, 
messages and social media records cannot be mentioned in Zimmerman's 
opening statement, although they could be looked at later in the trial.

An
attorney for Martin's family, Benjamin Crump, said the teen's parents 
were pleased with the judge's rulings. 'Trayvon Martin is not on trial,'
Crump said.

Circuit Judge Debra Nelson also refused to allow jurors to travel to the
shooting scene during trial, and rejected a defense request to delay 
the trial set to begin June 10.

The judge called the request to let jurors see the crime scene 'a logistical nightmare.'

Killed: Trayvon Martin, 17, was unarmed when he was shot dead as he walked home in February 2012

Zimmerman, 29, is pleading not guilty, claiming he shot the unarmed teenager in February 2012 in self-defense when the boy fought with him and went to grab his gun, he said.

A delay in Zimmerman's arrest led to protests nationwide. Martin was black. Zimmerman's father is white, and his mother is Hispanic.

Jury selection begins on Monday. The trial is expected to last more than a month.
