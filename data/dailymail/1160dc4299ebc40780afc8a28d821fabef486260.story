The owner and the manager of a nursing home were criticised by a judge yesterday for their heartless neglect of elderly residents.

Philip Bentley, 65, was told he had put cost-cutting before welfare while Faheza Simpson, 49, was condemned as a liar and a bully.

Jailing them for 12 months, Judge Jonathan Rose highlighted fundamental failures of care at Elm View nursing home in Halifax.

Neglect: Philip Bentley, 65 (left), the owner of Elm View care home in West Yorks, was found guilty of neglect along with manager and nurse Faheza Simpson, 49 (right), and the pair were sentenced to 12 months in jail

Problems included poor pressure sore 
management, insufficient toilet trips for at-risk residents, lack of 
cleaning materials and inadequate record keeping.

Simpson, who was described by the Judge as 'a liar and a bully' was found guilty of abusing the same patients, and another 68-year-old Alzheimer's sufferer who was hospitalised with a bedsore after only a week in the home.

After that patient was taken away, Bentley had tried to cover up the neglect by hiding the patient's file, asking a nurse to lie on her report, and giving a dishonest statement himself.

During the trial the court heard that in 2011 visiting nurses had found a patient lying in her own urine, that due to a lack of wipes patients were cleaned using their own underwear, and that one woman was left wearing the same incontinence pad for 13 hours.

Sentencing the pair at Bradford Crown Court, Judge Jonathan Rose said there were not enough cleaning materials at the home, records were poorly kept and that patients were not turned or taken to the toilet often enough.

He also highlighted a lack of staff, saying that Simpson's bullying manner drove employees away while Bentley failed to recruit more in the mistaken belief that his head nurse could cope.

He added that while Bentley had bought the home in good faith in 1990, by 2011 when the investigation started he seemed to have lost interest in.

The victims included two Alzheimer's patients, two people who could not move, and one 68-year-old man who was hospitalised after only a week in the home (file picture)

Judge Rose said his actions were 'simply unforgivable' and told him: 'You put the saving of money, perhaps your profit, over the welfare of elderly and vulnerable patients.

'A home is not like stocks and shares. It cannot be bought and used only as a means of collecting dividends and profits to be cashed in when the profit will be at its greatest. It is a gathering of humans.'

Today, Elizabeth Wright, from CPS Yorkshire and Humberside, said: 'This was a very distressing case involving the wilful neglect of vulnerable, elderly residents at Elm View care home in Halifax.

'Through not taking appropriate action, many residents developed pressure sores, or experienced rapid worsening of existing sores.

'These were not treated properly, and the worst cases were not reported, as they should have been, for specialised external nursing treatment.

'As a result these elderly people were left in conditions of unrelieved discomfort and some must have been suffering considerable pain.'
