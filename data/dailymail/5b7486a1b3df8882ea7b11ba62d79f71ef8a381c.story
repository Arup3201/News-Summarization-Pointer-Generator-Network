Genevieve Sabourin, the actress who claims she spent the night with Alec Baldwin and is accused of then turning stalker, has turned down a jail-free plea deal.

Prosecutors offered Sabourin an eventual dismissal if she does 18 months of counselling and agrees to stay at least ten blocks away from the Baldwin main residence, the yoga studios where his pregnant wife Hilaria works, and NBC studios.

Sabourin would also be banned from going to Amagansett, the East Hampton town where the couple own their second home.

No worries: Alec Baldwin's accused stalker Genevieve Sabourin leaves New York Criminal Court after her latest hearing on Thursday, she's turned down a no jail plea deal

'It's a very small town,' Manhattan Criminal Court Judge Ann Scherzer noted during talks at the bench with the attorneys.

The deal would include final orders of protection, barring her from contact with the couple for good.

Canadian Sabourin was arrested in April 2012 after allegedly following the actor and sending him disturbing emails.

Her attorney said they hope to be ready to accept a plea by her next appearance.

'Unfortunately didn't have enough time. We were hoping we could (resolve it) but we didn't,' said Sabourin's attorney Rick Pasacreta.

Sabourin, wearing a slim-fitting red dress for the holiday, got a strict warning to leave the couple alone.

'You cannot send them a message on Facebook or any other form of social network,' Scherzer told her. 'I'm talking any kind of communication device that exists on this planet,' to which Sabourin agreed.

Sabourin spent the night in jail in November for tweeting aggressively at Thomas,

She is due back in court on April 8, exactly one year to the day from her arrest in New York.

After confirming their happy news yesterday, Alec Baldwin and his pregnant wife Hilaria Thomas stepped out in New York on Wednesday.

And it seems there was more joy to come for the yoga instructor - as she indulged herself in a spot of retail therapy.

The happy couple were spotted leaving their NYC apartment before hitting the shops.

Hilaria looked lovely in jeans, 
platform boots and a padded jacket while 30 Rock star Alec was wearing a
long navy-coloured coat and clutching onto a suit bag.

Baldwin's
wife of eight months confirmed her pregnancy on Tuesday, saying it came
as 'a wonderful surprise' and they feel very 'lucky'.

Hilaria,
28, revealed the news during an appearance on Extra, for which she acts as a 
part-time correspondent, saying: 'We've having a baby. (It) was a 
surprise, a wonderful surprise.'

Alec, 54, has a 17-year-old daughter Ireland with ex-wife Kim Basinger.

He revealed he was unaware that his wife 
was even taking a pregnancy test at their country home and was amazed to
discover the news when he heard her screaming in the bathroom.

He said: 'There's a scream I heard, 
which is a scream normally reserved [for] if there's a spider in the 
house. It really is the most amazing thing. I'm lucky.'

Hilaria has already noticed a change in her body and she can't wait to start preparing their home for the new arrival.

She said: 'I'm showing. This is actually gonna happen, now we can start the nursery, the everything, the dreaming!'

Alec previously revealed that he hoped to become a stay at home father if Hilaria ever got pregnant.

He joked: 'I want her to get rich because I want to retire. She teaches yoga.

at the SAG Awards in Hollywood last month

'I
want her to become the world's first billionaire yoga teacher. I know 
it is a long shot, but that's the plan I'm sticking with right now.

'I want to have a baby and stay home and make the pancakes before I send my wife out to work every day to pay the bills.'

The couple were recently denied reports they were having a baby because they weren't ready to announce the news.

Hilaria
first sparked speculation she was expecting late last month when she 
showed off what looked like a baby bump while filming a segment for 
Extra that saw her pull off some impromptu dance moves.

Meanwhile a Canadian actress accused of stalking Baldwin is considering a plea deal, it was reported on Wednesday.

Genevieve
Sabourin appeared in a Manhattan court, with the case being adjourned 
until Thursday as she and prosecutors tried to hammer out a deal.

Sabourin lives in Quebec and has acted in television and film.

She
and Baldwin met on the set of the 2002 sci-fi comedy The Adventures of 
Pluto Nash. He had a cameo and she was a publicist. Baldwin says they 
had dinner together in 2010.

Police
originally arrested Sabourin after authorities said she had implored 
Baldwin to see and to marry her in emails sent only days after he became
engaged to Hilaria.
