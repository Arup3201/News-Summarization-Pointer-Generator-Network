When it comes to drinking champagne, Marie Antoinette has a lot to answer for.

It’s said that the first champagne glasses, produced in the 18th century, were modelled on the French queen’s breasts.

Well, all I can say is that she must have had very small breasts — the flat, bowl-shaped glasses that resulted are terrible for drinking champagne.

Experts say that we are using the wrong champagne glasses as traditional flutes let out bubbles and aroma

The same goes for the glasses recently created which were based on the model Kate Moss’s left breast as a stunt for a Mayfair restaurant.

The problem with these shallow coupes is that they don’t retain the bubbles or the aroma.

The unique selling point of champagne is a perfect wine that is laboriously and expensively made sparkling — so it’s crazy to let the fizz escape.

The swizzle-sticks popular in the Twenties presented the same problem. These little instruments — like a tiny chimney sweep’s brush with a silver handle — were used to dissipate the bubbles. What lunacy! They were just silly fashion accessories.

What you want to do to enjoy champagne at its best is to maintain its ‘mousse’ — or sparkle — and you want it to be fine, delicate and persistent.

But if you allow all the bubbles to leap out of the glass as soon as the champagne is poured, you’re losing this effervescence much too quickly.

That’s why shallow open glasses have, over time, given way to the taller, narrower flute in which the drink is now commonly served.

But now some experts are suggesting than champagne drinkers should ditch flutes in favour of nothing more special than an ordinary wine glass.

Frederico Lleonart, global wine ambassador for drinks giant Pernod Ricard, says a plain wine glass emphasises the bubbles and aroma in more complex champagnes

Their reasoning is that higher-end brands taste better in a broader glass.

Frederico Lleonart, global wine ambassador for drinks giant Pernod Ricard, says a plain wine glass emphasises the bubbles and aroma in more complex champagnes.

However, he does say simpler sparkling wines (such as prosecco or cava) should be served in flutes to keep the drink colder for longer and to show off the bubbles better.

I understand why Monsieur Lleonart recommends a white wine glass. It has a larger bowl narrowing to a smaller rim, so hangs on to the bubbles and captures the aroma at the top of the glass — right under the drinker’s nose.

However, I believe the perfect glasses are those produced by the champagne houses themselves, such as Krug.

Tall but generously-rounded before tapering to the lip, these are great at holding on to the liquid’s fizz and aroma. (In the champagne houses, they will also only serve a little bit of their precious champagne at a time in a glass — so you appreciate the drink properly.)

Simpler sparkling wines (such as prosecco or cava) should be served in flutes to keep the drink colder for longer and to show off the bubbles better

Still, there’s no reason to throw out your flutes. Indeed, they are much favoured. Part of the point of champagne for many people is the luxury aspect — and a flute signals luxury to anyone looking on. People enjoy the theatre of it all. But the fact is that they are often straight-sided rather than tapering, which means the sparkle escapes more easily and the aroma doesn’t collect. Ideally, the sides of the glass should turn in at the top in a tulip shape.

Even so, flutes are a lot better than anything inspired by Marie Antoinette, and preferable to the ice cream cornet-style ones, too. Fortunately, they went out of fashion in the Eighties when it was thought chic to mix champagne with orange juice to make Buck’s Fizz.

They were a nightmare to clean because the citrus ‘bits’ got stuck at the bottom of the cone.

I’m not against these new-design glasses, where a little scuff at the bottom makes the bubbles shoot up like a geyser inside the glass. Very dramatic! But Y-shaped cocktail glasses are a total no-no — they certainly let the bubbles out too fast.

If you have some very special champagne, try one of the grander glasses — narrow at the top, with a wide bowl below.

Give it a try and you’ll start to taste champagne differently.

Of course, the enjoyment of champagne is really down to the choice of bottle — not the glass.

A key to great champagne is maturity. I find Pol Roger consistently delicious, but if you want to buy a cheaper champagne and still enjoy the mature, fuller-bodied, smoother flavour, then buy it and keep it (on its side) for a year or more and it’ll improve enormously. I’ve done that to special offer Heidsieck (£15 a bottle). Works a treat!

Regardless of what you choose, you will need glass that is sparkling clean because bubbles will attach themselves to any whisper of fluff.

And it’s crucial, too, to rinse properly as a remnant of detergent will kill off the fizz.

Temperature is also important. A study by the University of Reims (in the middle of France’s champagne region) suggested the local drink should be served at room temperature — 18c — because it produces more bubbles.

But if you open yours at that temperature, watch out for the cork. The pressure in a bottle of champagne is the same as in a London bus tyre.

Let it warm and the additional force could have your eye out.

Also, you’re likely to lose half the contents of the bottle.

I keep my champagne in a wine fridge at 8c. I open it at a 45-degree angle, which allows the pressure to escape without blowing out the liquid.

Then, holding the cork, twist the bottle slowly to ease it out — the noise should be like a duchess passing wind! Don’t let it go off like you’ve won a Grand Prix.

Pour into a glass — also held at 45 degrees so the liquid doesn’t foam out — sit down and enjoy one of the most delicious drinks in the world.
