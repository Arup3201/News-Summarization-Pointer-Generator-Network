Controversial post: Richard Kopf is a senior U.S. district judge in Nebraska

A top judge has told the U.S. Supreme Court to 'stfu' in a blog post.

Richard Kopf, the senior district judge in Nebraska delivered the profanity-filled blast to justices for taking what he sees as a too active role in controversial cases.

He said: 'Next term is the time for the Supreme Court to go quiescent–this term and several past terms have proven that the Court is now causing more harm (division) to our democracy than good by deciding hot button cases that the Court has the power to avoid.

'As the kids say, it is time for the Court to stfu.'

The acronym stfu is used for the phrase 'shut the f*** up'.

It is the latest in a series of blog-related controversies Judge Kopf has been involved in.

In March, he wrote a post titled 'On being a dirty old man and how young women lawyers dress'  that recommended some female lawyers should dress more conservatively.

In October, Judge Kopf declared Congress should 'go to hell'.

In his latest post, Judge Kopf posted up a letter from an anonymous lawyer begging him to stop blogging because it distracts the public from the fundamental role of a judge.

The lawyer wrote: 'There is little surprise in the level of attention drawn by, or the inevitable public reaction to, a federal trial judge, in a public forum, repeatedly using vulgarity including serial exercise of the f-word, apparently disclosing a fondness for looking up the skirts and down the blouses of female attorneys who appear before him, telling Congress to "go to hell", and urging the SCOTUS to "stfu,".

'How does such attention and reaction create an appearance that assists the public's acceptance of the law, help people trust judges, foster faith in our system, and advance the cause of the delivery of justice?'

The judge said he was thinking about following the lawyer's advice.

'I am going to give this letter serious consideration. It comes from someone I respect and whose judgment I trust. It also reminds me that, as a physician might say, I should always strive "first to do no harm." Blogging will be light while I figure this out,' he Kopf.
