A Chinese policeman and father-to-be has been killed by a driver who sped off claiming he was being picked on.

Video footage shows traffic officer Mao Shenquan, 32, being dragged along the road by the red BMW after he stopped the driver for trying to turn left in the wrong lane.

The SUV had illegally driven onto a zebra crossing and was told to reverse backwards by the police officer who was on duty in the Minhang District of Shanghai.

Driver Sun Haojie, also 32, ignored the officer and started performing the illegal manoeuvre when Mao made a grab for him, the People's Daily Online reports. The car drove away, pulling the officer at speed for 10 metres until he fell and hit the ground.

Witness Liu Zhengjin, who was in another car when the incident happened, said Sun did not stop.

'In that moment I saw the car make a sudden left turn and the police officer reached out to grab the door but the speed of the car was very scary and did not stop,' she said.

Shanghai police spokesman Liang Pai said the young officer suffered massive head injuries after either striking his head on the ground or getting hit by the wheels of the car.

He said: 'The CCTV cameras as well as Mr Sun's own dashboard camera revealed that he was twice told not to turn left at different points on the road, and at the second point he ignores the advice causing the accident.'  

Driver Sun told officers he had always made the illegal turn on the road without incident so he felt that he was being targeted by police when he was stopped and stepped on the accelerator. 

He said it was only after he sped off, that he saw lots of people behind him and realised that it was serious.

Stop: Suspecting the driver is about to do the illegal turn anyway, Mao goes back to chat to the driver

Dragged: Officer Mao gets caught and can be seen trying to keep up with the car as it drives away

Left for dead: The driver continues, dragging the officer for 10 metres before he falls off and suffers fatal injuries

Tragic: The officer lies dying in the street as the red BMW is driven off. Mao Shenquan could not be saved and the driver was later arrested

'At that moment my mind went blank,' he said.

Sun drove off leaving the officer lying motionless on the ground but later returned to the scene and handed himself in to officers.

The level-three superintendent was taken to hospital but died from his injuries. His heavily-pregnant wife had to be hospitalised with shock.

Colleagues paid tribute to Mao who had told them that being a police officer was 'a great honour'.

But they noted concerns that this tragedy was not the first incident of its kind.

'Another colleague sustained head injuries in a car accident in front of me and I took him to Changning District Central Hospital and he was fortunate enough to survive. 

'Today I was hoping for the same good luck but he wasn't saved.' 

China's public security authorities have vowed to crack down on lawless drivers following the fatality.
