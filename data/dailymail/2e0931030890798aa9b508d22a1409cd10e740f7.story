Parents with students at one California high school recently learned that two Planned Parenthood employees who taught their impressionable children sex education also held down some controversial side jobs.

One of the sex-ed instructors at Acalanes Union High School in Lafayette also taught a class on sex toys at a nearby shop while the other identified herself as a 'pleasure activist' on her now-deleted Twitter profile.

The job history of the two teachers was revealed after parents learned about the school's partnership with Planned Parenthood and demanded the curriculum be changed.

Some of the parents felt that Planned Parenthood, an organization that provides complimentary reproductive and women's health services, was actually encouraging their children to start having sex. 

Two Planned Parenthood workers who taught sex-education at Acalanes High School in Lafayette, California are being criticized for their controversial side jobs. Neither are employed by the school anymore

'Planned Parenthood is a business. It's a business that sells sex. It's a way to get clientele and to sexualize young people and turn them into lifelong clients,' parent Camille Giglio told CBS San Francisco in November.

The unhappy parents then partnered with conservative legal group the Pacific Justice Institute to petition for a new sex-ed curriculum. 

In the course of their fight with the school, the career histories of the Planned Parenthood instructors were revealed and two of the teachers raised even more concerns to parents. 

One of the instructors teaches a 'pleasure' workshop at a store called Good Vibrations in nearby Berkeley, which sells sex toys. 

Meanwhile, one of the other instructors had described herself as a 'pleasure activist' on Twitter, and mentioned attending CatalystCon, a sexuality conference. 

'These are two representatives (who) happen to have a truly questionable background,' Brad Dacus of the Pacific Justice Institute, which made the initial inquiry with concerned parents, told FoxNews.com. 'There has been outcry from the parents. This school district doesn't seem to get it when it comes to the proper protection for the students.'

Dacus says the two instructors are no longer teaching at the high school, but it's unclear who will replace them. 

'They announced that they would not be continuing, but they haven't said who would be teaching the students in the future,' he said. 'This school has continually displayed a lack of accountability.

'The two other schools in the district have chosen not to use Planned Parenthood and they are not having any problems.'

The school previously released a statement defending their use of Planned Parenthood, a group they have worked with for more than a decade. 

'The instruction is age-appropriate using objective and medically accurate information. The value of abstinence is emphasized as it is identified as the only certain way to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infection. We believe the instruction builds student skills for making and implementing responsible decisions about sexuality…Parents are given prior notification of the presentation, the topics to be covered, and informed that a Planned Parenthood educator will be presenting to the students. Parents are able to opt their students out from the instruction.'
