Poaching them on a stick is certainly an novel way of cooking your eggs, but at least it appears to come without all the mess.

A machine promises to end the laborious process of frying, poaching or scrambling eggs - and invites users to simply crack an egg into its upright cylinder and select a desired cooking time.

The Rollie Eggmaster from US company Kalorik uses ‘vertical cooking technology which combines a cylindrical non-stick cooking surface surrounded by a revolutionary heating element’.

Three steps: A machine promises to end the laborious, messy process of frying, poaching or scrambling eggs

Happy cooking: The product invites users to simply crack an egg into its upright cylinder and select a time

Possibilities: The firm said users can create 'perfect pizza rollies or cinnamon rollies for a delectable dessert'

The firm, based in Miami Gardens, Florida, said the device - delivered for $40 (£25) - can also help you make ‘tasty rollie burritos, perfect pizza rollies or cinnamon rollies for a delectable dessert’.

However, reviews on the product's Amazon page have been very mixed - with some customers giving it top marks, but others claiming it stopped working after just a few uses.

John Willis said: ‘I was excited to buy this, but after four uses it died on me. It just stopped working. When I plug it in, nothing happens. I've followed the manual.

‘It died mid-cooking the fourth time I used it. Disappointment. I guess I should have expected that though. I liked using it the three times it worked. It's a shame it didn't last.’ 

In we go: The company advises customers to use 'no more than two large eggs at one time' in the system

Here's the result: The Florida firm insists that users should 'not mix the egg yolk with the egg white'

All smiles: Reviews on the device's Amazon page have been very mixed - with some customers disappointed

But Taher Alnajjar said: ‘Amazing product and can do my lovely eggs within five minutes... it's better than running somewhere to find food.’

John Willis, customer

However, other users - whose purchases have been verified by Amazon - including Abo Abdallah, 'Scallywag' and 'jthomas', all said that their Rollie Eggmasters had stopped working.

The company said on its website that the device comes with a one-year warranty against 'defects in material and workmanship', and it will issue a replacement if the product is proven to be ‘defective’.

It advises customers to use ‘no more than two large eggs at one time’ in the system, ‘use regular or large eggs’ and insists that users should ‘not mix the egg yolk with the egg white’.
