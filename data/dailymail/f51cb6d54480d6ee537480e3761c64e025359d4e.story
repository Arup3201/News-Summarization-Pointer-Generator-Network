A neighbour of the mother arrested on
suspicion of murdering her two young children after suffering from post
natal depression asked today: 'Why did no-one spot it?'

Felicia Boots, 34, is being held by 
police after her devastated husband Jeff returned home from work to 
discover the lifeless bodies of his ten-week-old son Tej and 
14-month-old daughter Lily Skye.

The children had been smothered to death and his wife had apparently tried to slit her wrists.

The couple had moved into their five-bedroom house in Wandsworth just two weeks ago.

Jewellery designer Mrs Boots is understood to have been suffering from post-natal depression.

Today a neighbour was seen sobbing as she left a bunch of flowers in front of the house.

Barely able to speak and declining to give her name, she said: 'Why did no one spot it? It’s just so awful.

'We all have children around here and
it’s hit us all. I can’t imagine what she must have been going through,
why didn’t she get help? My friend used to walk the dog with her and 
she’s in pieces. I can’t say any more, it’s too much.'

The note she left on the flowers 
read: 'Hello, you don’t know me but I just wanted to say we are sorry 
for your loss. You and your wife are in our thoughts and I hope you find
the strength to get through this. We hope you find peace back in your 
lives one day. A neighbour a few roads away. God bless.'

Neighbours heard investment banker 
Jeff Boots, 34, cry, ‘Oh my God, oh my God’ as he desperately tried to 
save his babies.

He was later heard wailing: ‘My lovely son, my beautiful daughter. They've gone. Help me, help me, help me.’

Other flower tributes and a teddy 
bear were also left at the scene, which remains cordoned off with a 
police officer standing guard.

Another woman added: 'We all have 
children in this area. My friend lost her daughter a few weeks ago and 
she would have been the same age. I didn’t know them but it’s so 
upsetting.'

The children were pronounced dead at the scene when emergency services arrived at the £1.2million semi-detached house in an affluent part of Wandsworth, south London.

Mrs Boots was arrested at the family home. She had apparently tried to harm herself but did not need hospital treatment.

The jewellery designer, who runs a website called Pink Tangerine, was being questioned by detectives from Child Abuse Investigation Command yesterday.

The couple, originally from Canada, had just moved into the three-storey house near Wandsworth Common, in a part of south London nicknamed ‘nappy valley’ because of its popularity with rich young professionals starting families.

One neighbour described them as appearing to be ‘a typical middle class couple’.

Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, said she heard Mr Boots’s reaction when he came home on Wednesday evening.

She said: ‘I could hear a man screaming: “Oh my God, oh my God”. He then shouted: “I loved my son and I loved my daughter!”

‘His voice was wailing: “My lovely son, my beautiful daughter. They've gone”. Then he said: “Help me, help me, help me”.

‘I thought his wife should come and help him, but I heard nothing from his wife.

‘Then he shouted: “I love my family. I love my children”.

‘It was like a mantra which went on for a while. It was shocking when the police arrived and we realised how serious it was.’

Neither of the children had any visible injuries and it is believed they may have been smothered.

Oliver Jones, 27, a business consultant who lives opposite, said: ‘I arrived home when the first police car arrived and he was in floods of tears. The police were here from about 7.30 to about 9.30. The wife was led out to the police car. She seemed very calm and placid.’

Mr and Mrs Boots had previously spent five years renting a £2,100-a-month penthouse in an apartment block nearby.

Mrs Boots worked as a hair stylist in 
Canada but turned to creating her own jewellery from her home-based 
studio under the name Pink Tangerine after moving to London.

On her website it says: ‘A Canadian-born stylist is pursuing a dream.’

Her Facebook page has pictures of her on holiday with her husband. She comments on one picture of herself: ‘New doggy, yoga every day and 11-week-old Lily in my belly – a trip Boots and I won’t forget.’

Police said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths.
