Guilty: Christopher Haughton tried to kill two police officers with a meat cleaver

A knifeman who tried to kill two police officers with a meat cleaver after storming into a butchers and demanding ‘Give me a chopper!’ faces being sent indefinitely to Broadmoor.

Christopher Haughton lashed out with a knife at policemen who cornered him in the shop and continued to injure the officers after they tried to restrain him.

Haughton, 33, of Wembley, north London, was convicted at the Old Bailey of the attempted murders of PCs Alistair Hinchliff and Thomas Harding.

He was also found guilty of assaulting six other officers.

Judge Peter Beaumont, the Recorder of London, said Haughton would be ordered to remain at Broadmoor hospital without limit of time, later this week.

Haughton, who suffers from paranoid schizophrenia, injured three officers during an incident in October, last year.

He was allowed bail but in November, he caused chaos when he launched his knife attack at a halal butcher’s in Kingsbury, north London, the following month.

He was heard chanting ‘God help me to kill my enemies’ moments before the attack.

The police were called and when two officers tried to speak to him, the 33-year-old, who was armed with a ten-inch butcher’s knife, refused to calm down and bit one of them on the arm before throwing bricks at him injuring his hand.

As back-up arrived, Haughton made his way towards the butcher’s shop but stopped to throw a breeze block at the patrol car’s windscreen and tins of baked beans grabbed from a shop at pursuing officers.

He then stormed into a Halal butchers screaming 'Give me a chopper! Give me a chopper!' before he grabbed the knife and turned on officers who feared he may attack innocent workers or shoppers.

Attacked: Pictured left to right are Alastair Hinchliff, Andrew Robb, John Charlton, Tom Harding and Sham Haque who were involved in the incident in a butcher's

One officer, PC Thomas Harding, tried to
pin him down with a riot shield but Haughton managed to straddle him 
and repeatedly stabbed the officer who wore a stab proof vest until one 
blow pierced below the protection into his bowel.

As another officer, PC Alastair 
Hinchliff, pushed Haughton off PC Harding, he too fell to the floor and 
Haughton slashed him across the left side of his face from temple to ear
with the knife penetrating his cheek into the mouth.

He then stabbed PC Hinchliff in the 
upper and lower arm exposing the muscle and tendons of the arm as other 
officers struck him with their batons with no effect.

Haughton then lashed out twice cutting across PC Andre Robb’s knee.

'Despite
his continued violence' officers managed to pin him against the meat 
counter but as they tried to cuff him, Haughton attempted to stab PC 
Shaun Haque in the neck but an officer managed to grab his wrists.

Incident: Police cordoned off the scene after the stabbings in Kingsbury, north west London. Medical supplies can be seen strewn across the road

Evidence: PC Stephen Barker, seen arriving at the Old Bailey, said Christopher Haughton bit him and tore his sleeve off with his teeth

Prosecutor Ed Brown QC said: 'The 
scene was a dreadful one - officers very badly injured, some critically 
so and blood everywhere from their injuries, with police and ambulance 
personnel doing what they could to give first aid to the officers before
they were rushed to hospital'

Uninjured officers succeeded in handcuffing the defendant, placing him in leg restraints and he was taken to a police van.

As he was bundled into it he shouted 
'Kill me, kill me, I want to die. I want to come back as Freddie Kruger 
and added 'F*****g pigs, I hope you all die, and all your children die.'

After he was finally subdued by 
officers with riot shields, Haughton spat mouthfuls of blood at them and
said he was HIV positive, boasting: ‘I love giving women AIDS.’

Edward Brown, QC, prosecuting, told 
the court that some of the officers now found it difficult to attend 
incidents where a knife might be involved.

Previous attack: Haughton allegedly bit WPC Vicky Vincent in her thigh drawing blood and spat blood into WPC Alison Spruce’s face when they visited his home following a noise complaint

PC Harding had 9inches of intestine removed after he was stabbed in the stomach through a shield.

He suffered 'unspeakable pain' and thought he was going to die.

PC Hinchliff, who was stabbed in the 
face and arm when he went to help his colleague, said he had been left 
with scars on his face.

Mr Brown said: 'He tends to shy away from incidents when mention is made of someone carrying a knife.'

Mr Brown told the trial: 'Some of the 
officers suffered very significant injuries indeed, all the result of 
this defendant’s violence.

'It was perhaps only a matter of very good fortune that some of the police officers escaped with their lives.'

The Police Federation said the case highlighted the need to speed up the roll-out of Taser stun guns to frontline officers.

Currently only officers with specialist firearms training can use the weapons in the Met.

As police tried to put Haughton into handcuffs he attempted to stab another officer in the neck

Paul Davis, secretary of the 
organisation operational policing sub-committee, said: ‘We believe that 
all frontline officers should have access to Tasers while on duty and 
have requested that the number available be trebled from 12,000 to 
36,000.

‘The reduction of police officer 
numbers has meant officers are less likely to have backup, making them 
more vulnerable to attack.

‘It is therefore imperative they have the equipment needed to protect themselves and the public.’

Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe said 
he wanted to see the 50,000 volt weapons carried in day-to-day response 
cars following Haughton’s attack.

In pre-trial legal hearings Haughton 
claimed he was Jesus Christ and police were trying to stop him in his 
work of urging gang members to lay down their arms.

Haughton claimed he was insane and had acted in the way he did because police were trying to kill him.

Haughton was also convicted of ABH on 
WPC Vicky Vincent and common assault on WPC Alison Spruce just a month 
before in October 2011.

Police had been called to Haughton’s 
bedsit in Streatham, south London, as he played loud music, brandished a
samurai sword and threatened other residents forcing them to flee.

When one resident complained about the 
music, Haughton pushed him down the stairs and then tried to kick in all
the bedsit doors, causing £2,500 of damage.

When officers arrived he charged at 
them armed with a broom and in the violent struggle officers had to use 
CS spray to subdue him.

Before launching his attack, Haughton went into a butcher's shop where he took a ten-inch knife, it was claimed in court

However, he still managed to bite WPC 
Vincent in her thigh drawing blood and only let go when another officer 
whacked him on his shoulders with a baton.

He then spat blood into WPC Alison Spruce’s face.

Psychiatrist Dr Philip Joseph said 
Haughton had been suffering from mental illness, but he would have been 
aware what he was doing was wrong and was in control of his actions.

Haughton denied assaulting PC Alison 
Spruce and causing actual bodily harm to PC Vicky Vincent during the 
arrest in Streatham on October 9 and was convicted by unanimous 
verdicts.

He was also convicted of the attempted murder of PCs Harding and Hinchliff by a majority verdict of 11-1.

He was further convicted of wounding 
PC Robb with intent and attempting to wound PC Haque with intent, also 
by majority verdicts of 11-1.

Haughton was cleared of alternative charges of attempted murder in respect of PCs Robb and Haque.

He was cleared of causing grievous 
bodily harm to Sgt Weir, but convicted of causing actual bodily harm to 
PCs Charlton and Barker.

He further denied causing actual 
bodily harm to PCs Charlton and Barker and attempting to cause grievous 
bodily harm to Sgt Weir.

He denied all the charges against him.

Lawyers on both sides agree it will 
be in everyone’s interest for Haughton to be detained under section 37 
of the Mental Health Act, twinned with a restriction order without limit
of time.

Haughton is to be sentenced on Thursday.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
