Accused: Anthony McGraw, 40, allegedly poured a large amount of hot grease over his girlfriend

A woman has been left permanently disfigured after her boyfriend allegedly poured boiling fat on her face while she slept.

Anthony McGraw, 40, fled the couple's home in Tuscaloosa, Alabama after pouring a large amount of hot grease over his girlfriend, 39, while upset over the state of their relationship, according to police.

He was later found hiding in a nearby abandoned building, and now faces a charge of first-degree domestic violence assault, while the unidentified victim is thought likely to require cosmetic surgery.

The incident happened at the couple's home in west of the city at around 4am on Sunday.

McGraw had apparently been cooking before deciding to use the oil as a weapon, according to Tuscaloosa County Metro Homicide Unit's Lieutenant Kip Hart.

'He was cooking a meal and she was asleep on the couch when he came across some information that made him upset enough to do this... Based on what we know, we donâ€™t think it was premeditated,' he told Tuscaloosa News.

It is believed the victim had two children at the property at the time of the attack, including a teenager to which McGraw is the father.

The victim was transported to UAB Hospital in Birmingham, where she is being treated for severe but non life-threatening burns to her face and arms.

'My understanding is her injuries are quite severe as far as she'll probably need cosmetic surgery,' Lieutenant Hart said.

According to a police report, the victim claims she awoke to see McGraw standing over her pouring the boiling fat onto her face.

McGraw had left the scene by the time police arrived, but he was later found cowering in a nearby abandoned building at around 7pm the following evening.

He has been charged with first degree assault - a crime described as an attack 'with intent to disfigure another person seriously and permanently' - and is held on a $60,000 bond.

A judge 
revoked his probation on a 2009 felony marijuana possession charge and a
 2006 drug distribution charge. He is being held with no bond set in 
those cases.

The couple's relationship problems are thought to date back at least until last August when the victim told police that McGraw had threatened her.

A subsequent restraining order against McGraw was dismissed a month later.
