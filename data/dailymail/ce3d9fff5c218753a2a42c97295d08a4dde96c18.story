A prominent GOP fundraiser and her family accused of setting their mansion alight in a $20 million fraud scheme have headed to court - just three weeks after her husband took his life.

The week-long preliminary hearing underway in Bucks County, Pennsylvania will determine whether Claire Risoldi, her two adult children, her daughter-in-law and two others will face trial.

Risoldi's husband, Thomas French, was also charged with his relatives in January but he took his life in February and left behind a note saying he couldn't handle the stress of being falsely accused.

An investigation into the family's claims began after a 2013 fire at the stately home in Doylestown. It was the third blaze in five years at the property, which the Risoldis dubbed Clairemont.

After the fires, the family allegedly lived large on trumped-up insurance claims and attempted to intimidate witnesses when they learned that investigations into the payouts were underway.

On Tuesday, friend Tina Mazaheri, a lawyer, told the court that Risoldi visited her to ask what she would tell a grand jury if she was questioned about the fires, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported.

When Mazaheri said lying would violate her professional duty, Risoldi erupted in anger and shouted at the woman, Mazaheri told the court.

Also on Tuesday, a jewelry expert was called to testify against the family as prosecutors intended to show Risoldi claimed losses for jewelry that later turned up in her bank deposit box.

Risoldi had falsely accused volunteer firefighters of stealing 55 pieces of jewelry worth more than $10 million while battling the flames, according to a grand jury presentment earlier this year.

Family ties: Risoldi's son, Carl A. Risoldi, 43, a public relations and marketing specialist, and his wife, Sheila M. Risoldi, have been charged with multiple offenses, including theft by deception

Accused: Clarie's daughter Carla Risoldi, a former Bucks County prosecutor and now a private attorney, and private investigator Mark Goldman, 54, have also been charged on multiple counts

The collection had included two items valued at $106,000 only four months earlier, officials said.

Authorities said they  uncovered a decades-long pattern of questionable insurance claims by Risoldi.

She still possessed jewelry she reported stolen in 1993, according to investigators, and had reported another jewelry theft from a different home in 1984 and a house fire in 1977. 

The family appeared in court sitting behind their lawyers on Tuesday but declined to comment.

Risoldi's son, Carl A. Risoldi, 43, and his wife, Sheila M. Risoldi, 43, are also charged as well as private investigator Mark Goldman, 54, and fabric vendor Richard Holston, 51.

Defense attorneys said they do not expect the family to testify in this hearing.

Their defense lawyers said the causes of the fires were 'undetermined' and not classified as arson. They also pointed that the payouts were made after insurers' investigators looked into the claims.

Officials previously said that large amounts of highly flammable material had been placed near the origin of each blaze.  

After the preliminary hearing, the judge will decide if there's enough evidence against each defendant to bring charges. 

The Philadelphia Inquirer previously reported that Risoldi has donated tens of thousands of dollars to the county's Republican Party, state lawmakers and a county judge.

She also has organized political fund-raisers for local candidates, that were held at her New Hope mansion.

As a result of the investigation, authorities seized about $7 million in family assets, including $3 million in bank accounts, $1.2 million in jewelry, six Ferraris and two Rolls-Royces.
