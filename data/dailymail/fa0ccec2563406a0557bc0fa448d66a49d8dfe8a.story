The family of a five-year-old who died of a rare blood disorder just weeks after suffering flu-like symptoms are today urging other parents to learn more about the condition.

Violet Mornington first fell ill on her fifth birthday. Within weeks she died, after doctors diagnosed the extremely rare Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), which leads to too many white blood cells attacking the body.

Doctors prescribed her antibiotics fearing she had tonsillitis, but were left baffled when her condition continued to deteriorate.

By the time medics discovered Violet was suffering from the rare condition, it was too late.

Violet Mornington first began suffering from symptoms on her fifth birthday. Just weeks later, she had died from a rare blood disorder called Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)

Kerry Mornington and her husband Ivan have urged other parents to be aware of the signs and symptoms of the rare blood condition that claimed their daughter's life

Today her parents Kerry, 47, and 
Ivan, 37, have urged other parents to learn more about the disorder 
which claimed their young daughter's life.

Mrs Mornington, from Fradley, Staffordshire, described the all-consuming grief after losing Violet.

She said the family have established a charity in her daughter's name to help others facing similar bereavement.

Violets
 in Bloom, which Mrs Mornington says has given her 'something to live 
for', aims to help other parents who have lost children, raise awareness
 of blood disorders and encourage more standard testing.

'When
 a child dies there are no positives to come from it,' said Mrs 
Mornington. 'There is no reasoning ‘why?’ - it shouldn’t happen. 'It is 
against the natural order of things.

'It is not like any other grief. It is like being lost at sea and the waves keep smashing you against rocks.'

She added: 'She’d always been a fighter and had a strong and determined personality.

Violet's parents Kerry and Ivan said they assumed she was simply suffering from a cold. She was later diagnosed with tonsillitis but her symptoms continued to deteriorate

Mr and Mrs Mornington described their daughter as a' fighter' with a 'strong and determined personality'

'She was a real tomboy, too, and when she passed away at the hospital we dressed her in her favourite Spiderman pyjamas.

'She refused to wear dresses from the
 age of three and she loved unusual music - we played Depeche Mode’s 
Just Can’t Get Enough at her funeral as it was one of her favourite 
songs.'

Violet's parents, who both work as benefits officers, first became worried about the youngster on the day she turned five.

The rare disorder baffled doctors, who diagnosed tonsillitis and suspected leukaemia.

Her father recalled: 'It was a Monday
 and Violet went to school as normal but when she came home, she said 
she didn’t feel too well.

'We went for a quiet meal but throughout she looked pale. We thought she was exhausted from celebrating her birthday at school.

'But over the next couple of days you could tell she wasn’t herself. She was still pale, tired and had a temperature. We put it down to a cold.

'We had a party planned for her on the Saturday. It was the first time we’d decided to throw a big do and had booked the local village hall, with a DJ and bouncy castle.

'We were debating whether to cancel it, but by the Friday, she had picked up so decided to go ahead.

'For the first half of it she was 
really energetic and jumping on the bouncy castle. But then she got all 
shivery and we gave her some Calpol. She did pick up a little bit later 
on.'

After repeated GP visits, Violet's desperate parents took her to A&E, where doctors suspected she had leukaemia. She was transferred to Birmingham Children's Hospital

Mrs Mornington said her family are determined to do something positive to celebrate Violet's memory, revealed they have started a charity, Violet in Bloom, to help other families facing similar bereavement

That day, Violet's father took her to see the nurse at their GP practice as she was too unwell for school.

He
 was told she had tonsillitis and Violet was given antibiotics. But 
instead of improving, she got worse and later that week she saw the 
doctor. Again, her parents were told it would probably clear up.

The family went back and forth to see their GP over the next three weeks, but still there was no diagnosis.

In desperation, the couple took her to A&E. More tests and scans were carried out and the next day the couple were told the youngster had suspected leukaemia.

She was transferred to Birmingham Children’s Hospital where a bone marrow biopsy was done.

'Violet
 was becoming more and more distressed because of all the tests being 
done,' said Mrs Mornington. 'She was very upset and it was heartbreaking
 to see her like that.

'She
 would suffer from raging temperatures which was one of the symptoms of 
HLH, but of course we didn’t know at that point it was the disorder.'

Eventually
 doctors ruled out leukaemia, and finally, tests found that she had the 
Epstein-Barr Virus, which had led to Hodgkins Lymphoma.

Mr Mornington, who has a daughter Beth, 19, from another relationship, said that Violet was given steroids - but her condition deteriorated.

Hemophagocytic 
Lymphohistiocytosis was finally diagnosed but, although Violet started showing some signs of improvement after going through three lots of chemotherapy, it was short-lived as she started suffering from serious respiratory problems.

Doctors were then forced to put her into an induced coma. 'It was like a whirlwind,' added Mrs Mornington, who has twins Molly and Caitlin, aged 16, and Matt, 26, from her first marriage.

On July 20 last year the couple were told to get some rest and were staying in the hospital’s nearby facility for relatives.

But they were woken at 5.55am the next day by a call telling them Violet had deteriorated.

Mrs Mornington added: 'We rushed to 
the hospital and saw Violet hooked up to so many machines. Doctors told 
us that she was very poorly and didn’t think she would get through it.

'Later
 that day, we were told she wouldn’t pull through and that they could 
take away all the machines so that we could spend some time with her to 
say goodbye.

'At this point
 she wasn’t suffering, but it was heartbreaking to watch her go through 
this.

'We decided to spend time with her, and we had 30 precious minutes 
giving her cuddles and telling her we loved her before she slipped 
away.'

Violet, here with father Ivan,
was finally diagnosed with HLH, and underwent three rounds of chemotherapy. But she began to suffer from serious respiratory problems and doctors were forced to put her into an induced coma

Since Violet’s death the couple, along with their other children, have been trying to raise more awareness about the condition.

Her father explained: 'We want people
 out there to know about HLH and what it can do and how quickly it can 
strike. GPs don’t seem to be aware, and if it is something they are 
taught about then it can only help other sufferers.

'I’ve
 read up on the condition and if it’s treated within four weeks of being
 detected, then you can save the person’s life. When we first took 
Violet to the doctors, she probably had it then. But because they didn’t
 know about the disorder it went undetected.'

In April they came up with the idea to create a memorial garden, under the banner of their Violets in Bloom charity.

The initial project will cost up to £15,000 and will allow families who have lost their children to use the garden to remember them with their own space or plaque.

'This is trying to find something positive from what has happened,' Mrs Mornington said. 'We want a lasting memorial to her legacy - something that will be there forever.

'In the beginning it was soul-destroying trying to find the perfect place for her.

Violet's mother said: 'Before she died, we had 30 precious minutes giving her cuddles and telling her we loved her before she slipped away.' The family are now trying to raise more awareness about Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)

'And then we thought if we are going through this then there are other bereaved parents in North Birmingham and around Lichfield going through the same.

'We didn’t want it in a church yard, as we didn’t want it to feel like a grave. And we didn’t want religion coming into it - we just wanted it to be about kids and parents.'

Having faced losing their treasured daughter, Mrs Mornington says she hopes her experience will help others.

She said: 'In the first few weeks after Violet passed away we were literally on our own.

'I am sure it is the same for other parents. In the hospital you are surrounded by a network - people looking after your children, psychiatrists, MacMillan Cancer Nurses, all kinds of support.

'Then you get home and you’re all alone. That feeling is so frightening. The counselling starts a few weeks later, but suddenly you have to cope.

'Even things like finding money for a funeral. A lot of ours was paid for and we had some savings for the rest, but what if you don’t have savings?

'Those are the kind of people we want to be able to help, and we have lots of ideas about how we can.'

Mrs Mornington added:
 'There isn’t a minute that goes by where we don’t think about her. Her 
legacy for us is to help others and stop this happening again. We want 
to do this to keep her memory alive. It was too late for us but 
hopefully it won’t be for other families.'
