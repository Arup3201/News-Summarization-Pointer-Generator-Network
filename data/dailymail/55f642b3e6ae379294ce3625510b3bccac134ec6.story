Mitt Romney’s campaign has said he will stop talking about his meeting with a former Navy SEAL killed in last month’s terror attack on the
U.S. consulate in Libya after the victim’s mother protested his use of her
son’s death.

Barbara Doherty, the mother of 42-year-old Glen Doherty, who was killed alongside the U.S. ambassador Chris Stevens and three others last month, said: 'I don’t trust Romney. He shouldn’t make my son’s death part of his political agenda.’

‘It’s wrong to use these brave young men, who wanted freedom for all, to degrade Obama,' she added.

Respect: The mother of slain ex-Navy SEAL Glen Doherty has 
asked Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney to stop talking about 
her son on the campaign trail

After Mrs Doherty's complaint was broadcast on  WHDH-TV in Boston, Romney's campaign said the election hopeful will no longer mention Doherty’s name in public.

‘Gov. Romney was inspired by the memory 
of meeting Glen Doherty and shared his story and that memory, but we 
respect the wishes of Mrs Doherty,’ said Romney campaign spokeswoman 
Amanda Henneberg.

Until this week, Romney hadn't mentioned Doherty's name on the campaign trail. 

But in recent days, Romney revealed on several occasions while campaigning that he had met Doherty several years ago near his home in La Jolla, California.

Killed: Doherty was one of four Americans killed in last month's attacks against the U.S. consulate in Benghazi

'He came from Massachusetts, where I’d been governor, had family there,' Romney told factory workers in Mount Vernon, Ohio. 'He also had skied in some of the places that I had found during the Winter Olympics in Utah. And we had a nice chat together.'

He told the crowd that Doherty was working in Benghazi as a private security contractor when he was killed.

'And you can imagine how shocked I was to learn that he was one of the two Navy — former Navy SEALs killed in Benghazi, just a couple of weeks ago,' Romney said. 'And I read on CNN International that when the report came that our consulate had been attacked, that he and the other SEAL that was killed with him, that they were in a different place, they were about a mile away, an annex somewhere else in the city. 

'And when they heard that the consulate was under attack, they went to the attack. They didn’t hunker down and hide themselves. No, they went there. That’s what Americans do. When there’s a challenge, when there’s a threat, we go there. When things are tough, we don’t give up, we keep fighting. There’s a saying that I’ve found pretty compelling. Clear eyes, full heart, can’t lose.'

Wreckage: Doherty exemplified the unwavering courage of American troops when he rushed to the site of the attack in Benghazi, Romney says

One of Glen Doherty's best friends says the former Navy SEAL remembered his meeting with Romney much differently than the way Romney described.

Elf Ellefsen, who said he has been friends with Doherty for more than two decades, told MyNorthwest.com that Romney unknowingly reintroduced himself to his friend several times throughout the evening.

'He said it was very comical,' Ellefsen said. 'Mitt Romney approached him ultimately four times, using this private gathering as a political venture to further his image. He kept introducing himself as Mitt Romney, a political figure. The same introduction, the same opening line. Glen believed it to be very insincere and stale.'
