Southampton midfielder Victor Wanyama has revealed he was worried as the club saw a number of important first-team names leave during the summer transfer window.

Having been tipped for a season of struggle by fans and pundits, the Saints have started the season impressively and sit second behind Premier League leaders Chelsea following Saturday's 2-0 victory over Leicester on Saturday.

However,  Wanyama admits he was worried when a number of high-profile names moved on in the summer and told Sky Sports' Goals on Sunday: 'A lot of important first team players left the club and I was a bit worried. I was thinking: "What's going on?" I've never been into a club where things happen like this. It was a bit worrying.'

While the likes of Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw and Dejan Lovren left St Mary's, as well as manager Mauricio Pochettino, who departed for Tottenham, Wanyama insists Southampton had reason to be confident following the arrival of new boss Ronald Koeman.

'We had all pre-season to gel together with the new signings and we knew we were going to get somehting with new players coming in.'

Dutchman Koeman signed striker Graziano Pelle, wideman Dusan Tadic and Shane Long - who scored twice in the win over the Foxes - and has guided Southampton to eight victories in their opening 11 matches.

Wanyama, who joined the Saints from Celtic in 2013, 'I dont think we're overpeforming, were working hard. If you work hard you're going to get results. We always go out and enjoy football and we get good results.'
