On his arrival at Luton airport on Wednesday, Romanian migrant  Victor Spirescu was warmly greeted by Labour MP Keith Vaz amid a fanfare of publicity.

Mr Spirescu, 30, insisted he was in Britain ‘to work and not to steal’ and yesterday he was true to his word, arriving at an Aldi supermarket in Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, at 8am to clean cars until 6pm.

Asked by the Daily Mail how he was enjoying his first week in the UK, he said: ‘Like I said at the airport, I have come here to work. I stay in the town with other workers and all is good at the moment.’

Britain through Luton airport

But as Mr Spirescu starts his new life, his 19-year-old fiancée is fending for herself on the small, rundown holding they own in a  village in Transylvania.

Each day, Catalina Curcean chops enough wood to burn so she can stay warm in temperatures as low as minus 25c. She then has to clean out a sty where a pig is being reared. It will be killed to eat next Christmas.

The slightly built teenager also feeds her six chickens three times a day, in the hope they will regularly lay eggs.

There is no running water in the crumbling one-bedroom house she bought with Mr Spirescu for £2,000 two years ago in the  village of Pelisor, which is 200 miles north of the capital Bucharest.

But let me tell you it's better than digging a ditch:  Mr Spirescu with his fiancée Catalina 
Curcean, who he has left fending for herself on the rundown holding they
 own in a village in Transylvania

Miss Curcean has to repeatedly lower a bucket on a winch down a well on the mud lane outside her home for cooking, cleaning and drinking. There is an outside toilet which consists of a hole in the ground covered by a wooden hut.

Her only luxuries are a TV and a laptop.

Two dogs and a couple of scrawny cats play among the wood chippings and rubbish on their small plot of land. Only a handful of the villagers have cars – the rest travel on horse-drawn carts or bicycles.

Like many of her neighbours, Miss 
Curcean does not work because she cannot find a job. Instead, she hopes 
her fiancé will earn enough at the car wash in the market town of 
Biggleswade to support her.

Miss Curcean is hoping to follow Mr Spirescu to the UK once she has saved up enough money for a bus or plane ticket.

Speaking
 to the Daily Mail yesterday, she said: ‘I was really shocked when I 
turned on the TV and saw Victor on the news. I couldn’t believe it.

‘There
 was my fiancé looking like a star. He only found out he had the job two
 days before he left so there was no time to plan. I don’t even know 
where he is living. All I know is that it’s with Romanian friends.

‘He
 told me that he will stay in Britain as long as possible and earn as 
much as possible so that we can afford to renovate our house.

‘I would love to go to Britain and I would do any job I am offered. I’m not fussy. I just want to earn a proper wage.’

There's no telling who you might meet: There is
 no running water in the crumbling one-bedroom house she bought with Mr 
Spirescu for £2,000 two years ago in the village of Pelisor, 200 miles 
north of Bucharest

Miss Curcean met Mr Spirescu two years ago when he moved from Bucharest to the Transylvanian village of Barghis to renovate a monastery. After a whirlwind romance they decided to buy a house in Pelisor using savings and contributions from their parents.

During good weeks, Mr Spirescu was able to earn £30 a week, largely through construction work. But the offers of work were sporadic and each job usually did not last beyond a week.

The couple managed to save up enough money to fix some of the leaks in their roof and insulate the walls from the bitter cold. Mr Spirescu also built a wood burner in a corner of the living room.

The village is home to about 250 people, many of whom are elderly. There used to be more than 700 people living there, but many have moved to Western Europe in search of work.

Miss Curcean added: ‘In Britain, Victor will be able to earn in a day what he used to earn in a week here. There are no jobs here.

‘I will miss him but I’m just so happy he has got a job in the UK. I know that there are more important things to do than car washing but it’s a start.

‘He’s hoping to find work in construction because that’s what he is good at.’

 first day that Romanians and Bulgarians were allowed to move to the UK and take up work

Car washers are thought to earn about £25 to £30 a day and have accommodation provided.

Mr Spirescu is hoping to earn more than £150 a week while in Britain.

A family of one worker with a dependant wife and two children would get £70 a week, on the minimum wage in Romania.

As if to stress his commitment to his new career, Mr Spirescu told the Mail: ‘I must go now – I have more work to do. Cars are coming in here all the time.’
