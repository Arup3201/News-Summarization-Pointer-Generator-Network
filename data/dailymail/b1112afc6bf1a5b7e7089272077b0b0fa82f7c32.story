IN YOUR PRIME, OLDER, WISER, HAPPIER by India Knight (Fig Tree £16.99)

India Knight confronts the grim choice between the bonkers Botox look of startled fixity or the equally unappealing wrinkly alternative

The question of what it means to get older is endlessly discussed in the media, yet it remains strangely uncharted territory.

There are plenty of novels on the subject — mostly rather autumnal in tone — and a plethora of off-putting books on the menopause. But when it comes to ideas on how to make the best of the second bit of life, there is a curious dearth of inspiration.

How to escape the curse of the elasticated waistband, not to mention the grim choice between the bonkers Botox look of startled fixity or the equally unappealing wrinkly alternative?

What are the rules of dating at 50? And how do you keep your sanity when you are menopausal, your teenage children have taken up shoplifting and/or underage drinking and your parents are losing their marbles?

Having written books on dieting, shopping and thrift, the columnist India Knight has decided to explore what she encouragingly calls the prime of life.

‘This is a book designed to function as a sort of manual,’ she writes. It’s got advice about bras and Botox and advice about ailing parents, care homes and dementia. It tells you what make-up to buy and how to be a better step-parent.

She covers middle-aged sex and dating and lots of other topics, too, in similar forthright fashion — from what to wear (navy, apparently. And leopard print. And trainers. Though possibly not all at the same time) to surviving the menopause, and how to be a good friend to someone who is ill (alas, the prime of life is also the moment when what a friend of mine calls The Organ Recital starts tuning up with a vengeance). She begins with Beauty and Maintenance or, as the sub-heading cheerily has it, ‘navigating the passage from nymph to nana’. This is an excellent place to start, because the great conundrum of middle age (as of that other transitional stage, adolescence), is that suddenly you don’t know who you are.

Your previous certainties are thrown into confusion as the clothes, make-up and hair styles that have helped you present a confident face to the world for the past three decades now look bizarrely wrong.

Knight tackles this intractable problem with an engaging mixture of ribaldry and sage advice — urging the supreme importance of taking good care of one’s teeth, hair and feet as one advances towards old age.

£18k is the average amount a woman spends on her face in a lifetime

This is not, it must be said, a book for those trying to keep their end up on a budget. The pages are filled with variations on the theme of ‘prices are, as you’d expect, not cheap’. But even if you can’t afford the John Frieda haircut, the £250 dental bleaching treatment or the Creme de la Mer moisturiser, it’s worth reading on.

For a writer so exhilaratingly worldly, Knight has an unexpectedly bracing streak of common sense and an even more surprising emphasis on kindness. The more ghastly the situation, the more strongly she insists on good behaviour.

‘Let it go. Let it gooooo,’ she urges in her section on divorce. ‘All the bad/mad/annoying things are in the past. The only person you’re harming by harping on about them is you — and, if you do it within their earshot, your children.’

Author India Knight 

She has a fund of equally sensible advice on dealing with teenage children, stepchildren and frail parents. (Though given her Twitter bust-up with her former chum, Liz Jones of this parish, it is predictable that her views should be considerably tougher when it comes to culling friends whose sell-by date is past.)

‘Some people mature like wine... and some turn to vinegar, I’m afraid, causing you to want to spit them out,’ she writes.

K night is tremendously opinionated, but there is something strangely comforting about her robust certainty. Reading her book is like having a conversation with a fearfully bossy but beloved old chum.

You may disagree with her views on the wrongness of Pointlessly Long Hair, or feel irritated by her relentless plugging of unfeasibly expensive Vi-Spring beds.

But just as you’re about to lose patience, she comes out with something so funny or endearing or just plain right (‘the supreme importance of an excellent funeral’, for example), that you can’t help but forgive her.

And when it comes to living well, taking care of your teeth, being kind to your loved ones and wearing leopard skin in moderation is pretty good advice at any age.
