Kenneth Hicks has been forced from his home by an EU law which protects endangered birds

Having lovingly worked the land on their farm for more than 30 years, Kenneth Hicks was looking forward to passing the estate to his sons when the time came for him to retire.

But the former Army officer told last night how that dream has been shattered after he was forced from his home by EU laws that put the ‘rights of birds above humans’.

Mr Hicks, 79, said he and his wife  Deidre, 78, had to leave their farm of 30 years with ‘a gun to their heads’ because of European regulations that allow the RSPB to flood the land to encourage breeding of endangered birds.

He said they were ‘devastated’ at having to leave 60-acre Harbour Farm in Bembridge, on the Isle of Wight, and being denied the chance to pass it on to their three sons.

Taxpayers are also understood to have been left with a seven-figure bill as part of a deal to rehome the couple.

‘We didn’t want to go but we had no hope of defeating European law. Neither did the British government,’ Mr Hicks said.

‘I am not a political person, but this is a worrying example of how European law affects ordinary people.’

Under the plan, raised water levels will flood the farm and surrounding land to create breeding grounds for wildfowl including brent geese, widgeons, shovellers, lapwings and redshanks.

‘It has forced us out of our home because it effectively values the rights of birds above the rights of human beings,’ Mr Hicks said. ‘We are broken-hearted.’ 

The couple’s ordeal began when the RSPB asked the Environment Agency (EA), which manages Britain’s waterways, to allow increased flooding from the nearby Eastern Yar river to encourage more breeding sites for rare species.

Mr Hicks worked the land at Harbour Farm on the Isle of Wight for more than 30 years. He was looking forward to handing it down to his sons but told how his dreams have been shattered

Mr Hicks said that would have rendered his land unusable but, because the land is within an EU Special Protection Area, he was told that if he fought the decision the RSPB could take him to the European courts.

The EU has strict legislation aimed at protecting wild birds and attempting to halt their decline.

As part of this, it designates  Special Protection Areas (SPAs) around Europe to encourage endangered species.

Harbour Farm on the Isle of Wight became part of an SPA that incorporates the Solent and Southampton Water in 1998.

SPAs
are covered by the EU’s Habitats Directive, which aims to provide ‘a 
strict system of species protection’ for birds. This includes 
regulations that nations must ‘maintain or restore natural habitats of 
Community interest’.

The RSPB
had already bought 420 acres from Harbour Farm – which is on land 
reclaimed from the sea – and allowed it to flood to create habitats for 
wildfowl. But the  charity now wants to raise water levels further, 
which will affect the adjacent farm.

Mr
Hicks was given legal advice that he would have no chance of 
overturning the decision because of the strict EU laws covering SPAs.

He was left to reluctantly accept what he called a ‘fair offer’ for the land from the EA.

He said: ‘We do not blame the Environment Agency. Their hands were also tied by Brussels and they have done everything they can for us in the circumstances. 

‘But it is a very sad situation. We have been forced into this agreement with a gun to our heads because it was made abundantly clear to us that under European law there was no other option.

‘It was excellent land which we used to grow hay for our horses and for around 100 sheep to graze.

‘When the river level rises the land is expected to be at the very least waterlogged and unusable.’

But he said the their ‘greatest 
sadness’ was not being able to pass on the estate to their three sons, 
who work as a psychologist, a doctor and a lawyer. ‘That has always been
the plan,’ he said. 

Mr 
Hicks, whose grandfather was born nearby, bought the farm after a 
27-year Army career during which he served in the Suez crisis.

At
the time it was within a Site of Special Scientific Interest – which is
designated by Natural England – and Mr Hicks said there was no 
suggestion water levels would be raised to protect birds.

An EU regulation means the farm can be flooded by the RSPB to encourage breeding for endangered birds. Mr Hicks said the law puts the 'rights of birds above humans'

But in October 1998 the land was designated part of an EU Special Protection Area. Soon afterwards the family sold 420 acres of the farm to the RSPB to help comply with EU regulations, so Mr Hicks was surprised about the new plan that will flood their remaining land.

The RSPB said the SPA was operating ‘far below optimum’ and raising water levels on its land – thereby flooding the adjacent farm – was the ‘final piece in the jigsaw’.

A spokesman for the charity denied there had been any threat of legal action, saying: ‘The RSPB’s role is the management and restoration of our own part of this potentially exceptional wildlife site.’
