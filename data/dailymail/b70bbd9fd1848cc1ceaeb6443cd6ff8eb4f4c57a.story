An Islamist fanatic will be freed from anti-terror controls within days despite being ‘determined’ to carry out a Mumbai-style attack in Britain.

The extremist attended a terror training camp in Cumbria with four of the five attempted suicide bombers involved in the London attacks of July 21, 2005.

He repeatedly tried to buy guns in what was suspected as a plot to carry out a mass-casualty attack in the UK, and has also travelled to Syria for ‘training’.

The plotter, known only as ‘CD’, was put under a Terrorism Prevention Investigation Measure (T-PIM) – including a tag and strict curfew – to protect the public in January 2012.

Security services believe the unnamed Islamic fanatic will revive his plans to carry out an attack in the UK similar to the one in the Chatrapathi Sivaji railway station in Mumbai in 2012

The Security Service say that without the T-PIM there is ‘a real risk CD will seek to revive his plans to undertake attacks in the UK’.

He has a number of associates in London ‘in connection with the attempted purchase of firearms’ and officials say that he would be able to quickly buy weapons.

But the order will be lifted on Sunday under rules introduced to protect the ‘human rights’ of terror suspects.

This is despite a judge ruling that the man has been trained in terrorism and that his ‘views and determination are unchanged’.

CD is one of six fanatics who are due to be released from their T-PIMS by the end of this month.

They also include a would-be suicide bomber involved in the liquid bomb plot to murder thousands by blowing up seven transatlantic planes. Experts estimate the total bill for MI5 and the police to keep tabs on the six suspects once their T-PIM restrictions are lifted could reach £20million a year.

The cases will be raised in the Commons today by Labour’s shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper.

She has attacked her Tory counterpart, Theresa May, for axing Labour’s control order regime and replacing it with the weaker T-PIMS.

Miss Cooper said: ‘Her decision to weaken terror controls means suspects described by the courts as highly dangerous only a year ago will now face no restrictions.’

Home Office officials insist that, to comply with Labour’s Human Rights Act, there was no option but to weaken the rules.

Under the old control order regime, there was no fixed time limit on how long a suspect could be monitored.

But the orders were repeatedly challenged in the courts under the Human Rights Act, with terror suspects claiming their right to liberty, a fair trial and a family life had been infringed. These cases led to the introduction of T-PIMS, which have a two-year time limit.

Believing that a terror suspect remains determined to carry out an attack in the UK is not sufficient for an order to be renewed after two years. There must be new evidence.

Labour, which has obtained new court papers relating to the threat posed by CD and his fellow fanatics, said the T-PIMS regime had left ministers with their hands tied.

The court papers on CD, who is guaranteed lifelong anonymity to protect his rights, show he was identified by the Security Service as a leading figure in a network of Islamist extremists based in London.

In 2004, he attended meetings organised by the jailed fanatic Mohammed Hamid and has attended at least one of Hamid’s terrorist training camps in Cumbria.

In 2006, he had extremist training in Syria before returning to London in 2009, where he was ‘involved in planning a terrorist attack on the UK, probably involving firearms’.

When his T-PIM was renewed a year ago, the judge said: ‘There remains a network. His views and determination are unchanged.’ In November 2008, Islamic terrorists killed 164 people in 12 co-ordinated shooting and bombing attacks across Mumbai, India’s biggest city.

Last night, Security Minister James Brokenshire said: ‘The police and Security Service have been working for some time to put tailored plans in place to manage the risk posed by these individuals once their T-PIM restrictions are removed.’
