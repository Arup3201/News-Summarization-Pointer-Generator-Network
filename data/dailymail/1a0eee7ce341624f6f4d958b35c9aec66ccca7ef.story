It sounds like a zany plot from one of his lower-end action movies but  Steven Seagal has been accused of killing a puppy.

Jesus Sanchez Llovera claimed his dog died during an early morning raid on his home by self-styled 'Sheriff' Seagal who was filming his reality show 'Steven Seagal: Lawman'.

Mr Llovera's home in Arizona was set upon by volunteer officer Seagal and a local police chief as they believed he was running an illegal cockfighting ring.

During the episode, Seagal and a heavily-armed unit drove a tank through the gates of the property before booting in the front door of the family home. 

Mr Llovera says his house suffered 'substantial damage'. He now wants £60,000 compensation plus a written apology from the veteran actor for his children 'for the death of their 11-month-old puppy, a beloved family pet'.

The Hispanic man also denied there was an illegal cockfighting ring at his home, accusing Seagal and his colleagues of killing 100 prize chickens that were being bred for 'show'.

Martial arts expert Seagal, 59, has responded by saying that talk of animal cruelty was 'beyond the pale'.

At the time of the alleged puppy shooting in March, Seagal added: 'Animal cruelty is one of my pet peeves.'

Mr Llovera's claims have also been disputed by Maricopa County Sherrif's Department who were part of the raid as they said the dog didn't die.

Officer David Trombi told ABC 15 said: 'That's a fabrication. That is just a bunch of c**p.'

Seagal has teamed up with Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpacio the controversial right-wing police chief who has dedicated much time to rounding up illegal immigrants in the state.

When not making movies, Seagal has become renowned for his more off-piste ventures.

He is an expert in the martial art of aikido and became the first foreigner to open a training gym for the technique in Japan.

His company, Seagal Enterprises, markets an energy drink known as Steven Seagal's Lightning Bolt which he endorses with the words: 'I have traveled the world creating this drink; there is none better that I know.'

He also has his own aftershave called Scent of Action.
