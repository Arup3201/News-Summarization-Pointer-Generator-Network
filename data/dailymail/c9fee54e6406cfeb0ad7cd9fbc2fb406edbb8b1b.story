Healthy food is three times more expensive than less nutritious alternatives, a study has found.

And the cost of eating well is rising much faster than that of eating poorly.

Researchers found that in 2012, the average price for 1,000 calories of healthy food was £7.49. This compared to £5.65 in 2002.

However, the same amount of unhealthy food was just £2.50 in 2012, compared to £1.77 a decade earlier.

The ‘cost per calorie’ of 94 key foods and drinks was tracked by a team from Cambridge University, who used government criteria to define what was ‘healthy’.

They suggested that more could be done to take into account the cost of living well when making decisions about public health.

Dr Pablo Monsivais, from the university’s Centre for Diet and Activity Research, said: ‘To help achieve long-term improvements in eating habits, we need to address the high and rising prices of healthier foods.

‘This is likely to be influenced by a number of factors including agricultural policy, food distribution and retail pricing strategies.

‘Additionally, there is growing evidence that targeted subsidies can promote healthy eating for people on low incomes.’

Diet-related illness costs the NHS an estimated £5.8billion annually, the researchers said. A quarter of adults and a fifth of children are obese, with the rate almost doubling over the last 20 years.

Researchers discovered that unhealthy, fatty food was far cheaper than the healthy alternative 

The chief executive of the NHS Simon Stevens warned last month ‘obesity is the new smoking’ in terms of avoidable illness. He said: ‘If, as a nation, we keep piling on the pounds around the waistline, we’ll be piling on the pounds in terms of taxes needed just to keep the NHS afloat.’

He is expected to unveil a five-year plan for the NHS this month including proposals on how to tackle the country’s obesity epidemic.

The warning came after England’s chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies told MPs in March that a ‘sugar tax’ may be necessary to curb expanding waistlines.

A report from Public Health England also suggested that putting a 20 per cent tax on fizzy drinks would cut the number of overweight Britons by quarter of a million.

The document was released earlier this year, and identifies six possible ways of reducing sugar intake: higher tax, foods being reformulated, tighter advertising rules, warnings on packaging and encouraging farmers to grow healthier produce.

Lead author of the latest Cambridge research, Nicholas Jones, agreed that people need to be encouraged to eat the right things.

‘Food poverty and the rise of food banks have recently been an issue of public concern in the UK,’ he said. ‘But as well as making sure people don’t go hungry it is also important that a healthy diet is affordable.’

He added: ‘The increase in the price difference between more and less healthy foods is a factor that may contribute towards growing food insecurity, increasing health inequalities, and a deterioration in the health of the population.’

In 2013 a survey revealed that price was the most important factor to UK consumers when buying food. More than a third said it was the most important factor and 91 per cent said it was one of their top five.

By contrast, just 9 per cent of UK consumers considered nutritional value to be the most important factor when buying food, and only 49 per cent placed it among their top five criteria.
