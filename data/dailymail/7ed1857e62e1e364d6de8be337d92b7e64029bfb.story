Everyone who meets Brian Maixner is greeted with a huge laugh and an even bigger smile.

Only the waiter and single dad from Wichita, Kansas, has struggled with dental issues since he was a child, after chipping one of his front teeth lead to a series of infections that he has never been able to get on top of.

It was something that struck Fred Boettcher, an attorney from Oklahoma, who was in town catching up with his daughter at the Doo-Dah Diner, where Maixner works. 

'I took one look at this young man and knew he was something special,' Boettcher told KWCH 12.

'He carried himself with such kindness and confidence with a mouth that looked painful. I was struck by that.'

Problem: Waiter Brian Maixner has suffered severe dental decay across his mouth since he was a child, but could not afford to have it fixed

Ongoing issues: Maixner, a single father, said his dental problems started when he chipped a front tooth at a child, leading to a variety of other issues he hasn't been able to afford to get fixed

Boettcher decided he wanted to help Maixner, who was until that point a complete stranger.

He went over and spoke to Maixner's manager, and told her he was leaving behind a $25,000 tip to help him get a new set of teeth.

'This man doesn't know me and this is something I could never afford to do for myself,' Maixner said, admitting he burst into tears when his manager told him the news.

'It touched me so much that he cared.'

The grand gesture came at no surprise to Boettcher's daughter.

'Dad gives so much, I remember him buying groceries for people in need when we were growing up,' Meredith Boettcher Young said.

New reason to smile: Last week Maixner underwent a number of procedures and now has a whole new set of teeth, thanks to the generosity of a random customer

Overjoyed: 'This has been a complete life changer,' Brian Maixner said of his new chompers

Kind-hearted: Fred Boettcher was visiting his daughter Meredith (pictured together) in Wichita when he noticed Maixner and decided he wanted to help

Before: Brian Maixner had always been self-concious of his smile, growing up with teeth problems that had lasted well into adulthood, but that has changed thanks to customer Fred Boettcher (left)

New man: After years of painful dental problems, Brian Maixner got thousands of dollars of work done on his teeth—all without paying a penny, thanks to a generous diner who wanted to help

Maixner has since undergone a number of procedures and now has a complete new set of top front teeth.

The dental work has changed his life, he says, with friends, family and regular customers shocked at the difference it has made.

However no one seems happier about what happened than the person responsible, Boettcher.

No matter what religion you might be or whether you even believe in an after life the way to be satisfied in your life is to be kind to everybody and be as generous as you possibly can be," Boettcher said. 

'As happy as that fella may be it feels so much better to be able to put a smile on his face.'
