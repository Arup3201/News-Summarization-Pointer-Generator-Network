Cassie McCord died after she was hit by a car being driven by Colin Horsfall

A teenage girl was mown down by an elderly motorist days after he refused to surrender his driving licence to police despite failing an eyesight test.

Cassie McCord, 16, was on her way to college when 87-year-old Colin Horsfall’s car ploughed into her.

CCTV images showed how Horsfall’s red Vauxhall Astra veered on to the pavement and narrowly missed two pedestrians before regaining the road, then mounting the pavement again a few yards further on, hitting Cassie.

She died from severe head injuries the next day and Horsfall, a bachelor, died three months later, having never recovered from injuries he sustained in the crash.

The tragedy happened in Colchester three days after the pensioner drove into trees when he missed the entrance to a petrol station.

Police discovered he could not read a car registration from 20 metres – the  legal minimum.

They advised him not to drive while his details were sent to the DVLA but were not able to seize his licence.

A coroner yesterday recorded that Cassie was unlawfully killed and Horsfall’s death was an accident.

The hearing in Chelmsford was told that police were called to a Tesco petrol station in Highwoods, Colchester, on February 4 last year after Horsfall’s first accident.PC Daniel Bellingham did an on-the-spot eye test which revealed he could see only 16.2 metres – about 53ft.

The 87-year-old narrowly avoided hitting pedestrians as he mounted the pavement. Moments later he knocked down Cassie

The officer drove him home to nearby Rowhedge and spent two hours trying to convince him not to drive again while he submitted details to the DVLA. He said: ‘Mr Horsfall asked if he was permitted to drive. I told him he would be better off not doing so but he asked me again directly if he was allowed.’

Horsfall drove into Colchester town centre on a shopping trip on the morning of February 7.

Witness Adam Hart, who works in a bookshop, was being dropped off by his wife. He said: ‘A red Vauxhall Astra mounted the pavement. It went back on to the road then went back on to the pavement and collided with two girls.’

Mr Hart said his wife had thought it must
have been a fugitive being pursued.

‘The car seemed to be going 
incredibly fast, especially considering it was on the pavement. I didn’t
see any brake lights.’

   Cassie’s family have urged the public to support a campaign set up in her memory.Her mother, Jackie, has launched a petition calling for a change in the law in the wake of the death of her daughter (pictured).

Mrs McCord says no-one else should go through a tragic loss as a result of a legal loophole.

Cassie's Law is campaiging for the Government to give police new powers to seize a driving licence if they consider the driver unfit.

It would then be down to the DVLA to decide whether the licence is returned or revoked.

Mrs McCord said: ‘I feel as frustrated as the police that they were not able to hold on to Colin Horsfall's licence.

'If they had been able to do so my daughter would have been alive today.

I urge everybody to support Cassie's Law and we will carry on until there is a change in the law.'

So far about 10,000 people have signed the petition and Mrs McCord hopes to lobby the Government later this year to change the law.

Cassie, who was studying five AS 
levels at Colchester Sixth Form College and hoped to become a lawyer, 
was pinned against a shop front.

The teenager, who lived with her 
mother Jackie and brother Sam, 20, was taken to hospital where her 
life-support machine was switched off the next day.

Horsfall, a retired shipwright, died 
on May 13, having never recovered from the injuries he sustained in the 
crash, which a police investigator put down to ‘unintended 
acceleration’.

Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray  said: ‘The manner of his driving was extremely reckless.’

Horsfall had no family members at the inquest and his brother Terry, 74, declined to comment.

Mrs McCord, a job centre manager, said
the family were still trying to come to terms with their loss, adding: 
‘Cassie was a much-loved, vibrant, bubbly girl.’

She used the hearing to call for 
support for a campaign she has launched, supported by police and her 
local MP, for the law to be changed so that police can seize the car of 
someone unfit to drive. She has already collected 10,000 signatures.

‘Colin Horsfall was a selfish man,’ 
she said. ‘He knew he was unfit to drive but that didn’t stop him. I 
feel as frustrated as the police that they were not able to hold on to 
his licence.

If they had been able to, Cassie would be alive today.’

Sergeant Kevin May, of Essex Police’s 
serious collision investigation unit, added: ‘I totally support Cassie’s
Law.

We can seize the car if there’s someone driving without insurance.
Why can’t we do so for someone who is unfit to drive?’

Road Safety Minister Mike  Penning 
said police already have the power to arrest any driver  who poses a 
threat to himself or others and cases can be fast-tracked to courts 
which can withdraw licences.

But he admitted: ‘There is scope for the existing legislation and systems to offer more protection.’
