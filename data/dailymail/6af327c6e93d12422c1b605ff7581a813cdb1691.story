A mother and her former partner have appeared in court over the death of a toddler who suffered horrific injuries just before her second birthday.

Cara Lee-Fanus was rushed to St Peter's Hospital in Chertsey, Surrey, but died from a head injury the next day despite the best effort of medical teams.

Magistrates heard how doctors treating the little girl discovered bruises all over her body as well as burn marks on her head.
