Two of Europe's top clubs are in crisis as Real Madrid fell to a 1-0 loss at Athletic Bilbao and AC Milan could only manage a 2-2 draw with Verona.

The results leave Carlo Ancelotti's men top, but just two points ahead of a Barcelona side who have a game in hand, while Filippo Inzaghi's Milan are 10th in Serie A with just eight wins in their 26 league matches.

The Sunday papers in Spain and Italy have not held back in their criticism of the teams, with Corriere dello Sport's headline reading: 'No future for Inzaghi'. In Spain, 'Freefall' is the headline in Marca.

'No future for Inzaghi' reads the headline in Sunday's Corriere dello Sport after AC Milan drew 2-2 with Verona

AC Milan have struggled for the entirety of this season, and Inzaghi himself was coy about his future after the match.

Corriere carry a quote from the former Milan player: 'Will I stay? I'm not the one to ask,' while Gazzetta Sportiva quote Pippo as saying: 'We gave away a goal like fools. I go forward with my head held high.'

Nico Lopez was the scorer of Verona's all-important equaliser, in the 95th minute of the match. As Sportiva point out, he was the man who scored the goal against Inter Milan that led to the sacking of Walter Mazzarri in 2014.

Over in Spain, Marca claim Madrid lacked ideas and character as they collapsed at San Mames. Despite being top of the league, there are high expectations from fans of Los Blancos, and the 1-0 loss to Bilbao was far from good enough.

Aritz Aduriz scored the only goal of the game to 'turn La Liga upside down', and Ancelotti said post-match, 'it's quite confusing what we are doing in attack.'

'There it goes!' reads the headline in Sunday's AS, and they claim Barcelona will 'go out like a motorbike against Rayo', whom they play on Sunday lunchtime.

Barcelona can go top of La Liga if they win their game in hand against Rayo Vallecano on Sunday lunchtime

Barcelona can go top of La Liga for the first time in 16 games with a win, and should that happen Ancelotti will have a real problem on his hands. 

Mundo Deportivo carry a quote from Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi, who left a message for his fans on his Facebook page on Saturday night.

If they weren't already aware of the magnitude of their game, Messi's message 'We can't fail' will have certainly left no doubt in their minds.
