Who needs a shotgun when you have a four-iron?

Clay pigeon (skeet) shooting is all 'too easy' for American golfer Brandt Snedeker with a gun. And on this evidence, it's equally light work for the 33-year-old with his everyday weapon of choice.

The 2012 FedEx Cup champion shared a video on his Twitter account on Monday, showing him sensationally smashing golf balls through a parade of moving aerial targets.

Snedeker celebrates his stunning shot which he insists was real and not a stunt

The video post has since gone viral, amassing over 84,000 views on YouTube alone, as the former world No 4 shows off his sublime skill at a woodland area in his native Tennessee.

Snedeker, who is coached by Butch Harmon, wrote: 'Shooting skeet was getting to [sic] easy with a gun. So I stepped it up a notch'.

Some fans were sceptical of the stunt, however, suggesting the one-time Ryder Cup player had duped them.

But the world No 39 Snedeker insisted it was indeed genuine and wrote: 'And for all the people thinking I faked that shot.. I am too lazy and stupid to figure out how to do it.. It's real!!!'

Snedeker will be hoping to transfer his talent to the course this Thursday, when he begins his challenge for the Frys.com Open in California's Napa Valley.
