TV beauty Liza Irizarry is suing Selita Ebanks over claims the Victoria's Secret supermodel broke her nose in a catfight at a Miami nightclub.

Telemundo model Irizarry, 34, says she was punched in the face after greeting Ebanks' boyfriend, former BET host Terence J, with a kiss on the cheek.

She claims a drunken Ebanks told her 'don't be kissing my man' and struck her on the nose.

'I went to swing back — that's when all her friends jumped in. I felt hair pulling and fists coming at me,' Irizarry said in an interview in her lawyer's Manhattan office.

The fight, which broke out at 5am in Miami’s Dream nightclub last November, was broken up by one of Irizarry's male friends.

It was only the following morning when she realised the extent of her injuries.

'I was in so much pain,' Irizarry, of the Bronx, told the New York Daily News. 'My pillow was covered in blood.' Days later, she had surgery for a complex nasal fracture.

She said: 'I'm so angry, because she thinks she can get away with anything. Me saying hello to someone doesn’t give you the right to hit me.'

Irizarry will be filing for assault and battery in Hudson Superior Court and is seeking damages for pain, suffering and medical bills.

According to her lawyer Edward Steinberg, Miami police have not arrested Ebanks even though Irizarry filed a report and sent officers her medical records.

Ebanks’ lawyer, Paul Rothenberg, says his client said the 'claims are baseless'.

In an interview earlier this month, Ebanks told how she was head over heels in love with actor Terence J, who this year has starred in Think Like A Man and Sparkle as well as taking up a new position at E! News.

'We’re just happy to be in love and be a part of each others lives,' she said.

The Cayman-born model, who played a phoenix in Kanye West’s 2010 video, has worked for high fashion brands Neiman Marcus and Ralph Lauren, and appeared in magazines such as the Sports Illustrated and Vogue.

She is best known for her work as one of Victoria Secret's 'Angels' from 2005 to 2009.
