One astronomer in Denver captured footage of magnificent clouds at sunset yesterday.

Astronomer Phil Plait was in Denver, Colorado working on a documentary when he happened to look up at the sky and noticed rare and majestic clouds formations called iridescent clouds and lenticular clouds. He grabbed his film crew and had them film the rare colorful swirls and one massive cloud ridge.

Phil explained that iridescent clouds are characterized by striking colors like pink and green and are caused by sunlight reflecting off of tiny raindrops of ice crystals. The sunlight is broken up and the waves interfere with each other like 'waves in a bathtub.'

Lenticular clouds or 'lens shaped clouds'Â  are heavy cloud formations that occur in moist air and wind. The spot in the cloud where moisture condenses is stationary and appears concave as the wind flows around it and gives it shape.

Some of the clouds in the giant cloud ridge were beautifully shaded with two different colors as the setting sun hit the top of the clouds but not the bottom.

Phil Plait writes for Slate's Bad Astronomy blog and says if he's learned any lesson from his studies it's 'Look up. If you do it enough, the sky will deliver.'

Iridescent clouds: These clouds are characterized by vibrant colors that form as the sunlight reflects off raindrops and ice crystals

Lenticular Clouds: These clouds develop in moist air as the wet part of the cloud stays stationary and the wind whips around the rest of the cloud to give it shape

Double shaded cloud ridge: The top of the cloud is lit strongly by the setting sun while the bottom of the cloud is already dark

All in the mix: dark lenticular clouds hover over the building as the sunlit cloud ridge rolls on by
