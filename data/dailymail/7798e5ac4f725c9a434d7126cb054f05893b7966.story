Mark Zuckerberg and new wife Priscilla Chan were spotted brushing up on some Italian architecture as they toured the Sistine Chapel during their honeymoon in Rome.

Snapped by a fellow culture-vulture, the Facebook CEO wandered around the chapel in the Vatican with a priest and tour guide, occasionally placing an affectionate hand on his new bride's back.

The photo of Mr and Mrs Zuckerberg taking in Michelangelo's frescoes was just one many sightings across the Italian capital of the notoriously private social network founder.

Polish tourist Darek Rusajczyk posted the image to Twitter after spotting the social network billionaire and his wife, who is training to become a doctor.

The couple were dressed casually, with Zuckerberg in his typical jeans and t-shirt (but missing a hoodie) while Priscilla wore bright red skinny jeans and wraparound cardigan.

They were snapped listening intently to a guide explaining the marvels of the stunning 500-year-old paintings that adorn the walls and ceilings.

The couple were also seen at the Colosseum and the Spanish Steps. Zuckerberg took his new wife for dinner at Pierluigi restaurant which has been an institution in the Eternal City since 1938.

However the billionaire, 28, had come under fire for spending just 32 Euro on a lunch with 27-year-old Priscilla. The pair were spotted eating a Kosher restaurant called Nonna Betta in Roma's Jewish Ghetto where they were snapped by fellow diners.

They tucked into a bargain meal of Roman-style artichokes, ravioli in an artichoke sauce and fried pumpkin flowers but they had no alcohol choosing instead water and tea.

Within minutes of leaving the restaurant, the owner Umberto Pavoncello had confirmed the couple had paid a visit - while word also quickly spread via Twitter.

The couple's 32 Euro bill - equivalent to $40 - was also posted on the internet by Italian news websites and Mr Pavoncello said: 'They seemed like two lovebirds. They shared a plate of artichoke ravioli in the centre of the table. It was a very romantic scene.'

With Facebook's value plummeting just days and billions being wiped off its share value after it was launched, perhaps Zuckerberg was looking after his holiday cash during his break in the Italian capital.

Later the couple were spotted in Pierluigi's restaurant where staff revealed they dined out on a supper of prawns Catalan style, oysters and fish carpaccio, followed by lobster pasta and flame grilled fish washed down with a bottle of Chardonnay Gaia e Rei.

Unlike Nonna Betta, staff at Pierluigi were rather more reluctant to reveal the cost of their dinner but it was thought to be in excess of £120 - service not included - with a waiter saying: 'It was just the two of them.

'They were happy and content. They had an intimate and romantic dinner.'

Besides the Vatican were also spotted at the ancient Colosseum, as well as taking in the sights, sounds and colours of the Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps taking photographs every few minutes.

The couple are thought to have arrived in Rome by private jet and stayed at the luxury five star Portrait suites hotel close to the Spanish Steps which is owned by the family of fashion designer Salvatore Ferragamo with prices starting at 800 Euro a night.

Zuckerberg and his new bride had a sumptuous suite overlooking the Trinita dei Monti, the church at the top of the Spanish Steps and enjoyed breakfast in their room every morning before being taken around the city in a chauffeur-driven limousine.

On its website the hotel writes: 'Delight in the ‘Dolce Vita’ at the breathtaking Portrait Suites in Rome in the heart of Via Condotti, a stone throw away from the Spanish Steps.'
