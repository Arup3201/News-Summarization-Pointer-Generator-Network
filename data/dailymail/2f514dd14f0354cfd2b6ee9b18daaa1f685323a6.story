Britain has long enjoyed a love affair with all things French, from wine to high fashion. Now cosmetic surgery is being transformed by the introduction  of the ‘haute couture’ boob job from France.

It means every enhancement can be unique instead of simply  a choice of cup size.

A new range of implants with 600 possible variations gives women a bewildering choice  of gels, shapes, textures and volumes from the very large  to the conical.

Like all implants, they are each hand-made by a small team of highly skilled workers.

And instead of the trend to just make breasts bigger, the effects of surgery can be far more subtle. The range capitalises on a new desire for more discrete surgery, exemplified by the ‘has-she-or-hasn’t-she’ looks of Victoria Beckham and Catherine Zeta-Jones.

And for the first time the implants are being marketed directly to women, rather than just surgeons, as consumers have become more clued up following the PIP scandal.

Plastic surgeons say the choice reassures those left anxious after up to 47,000 women in Britain were fitted with defective implants made from industrial-grade silicone. Women can have much more control over their operations, and the implants come with a lifetime guarantee.

Consultant plastic surgeon Jonathan Staiano, of Staiano Plastic Surgery, said: ‘There  is now a matrix of implants,  in lots of different widths, profiles and shapes.

'You get a result that is tailored to your body. And the internet is changing everything. Women know exactly what they want and can get it.

'It’s the end of the days  of walking into the surgeon saying “I want a boob job” and them replying, “Yeah OK, sign this illegible consent form and we’ll sort you out.” No two boob jobs will be alike.’

The new Eurosilicone range  has been introduced by GC Aesthetics, which already owns  UK-manufactured implant Nagor.

It has a ‘Matrix’ line which offers nine types of implants that generate 102 possible variations, and another ‘Round Collection’ that has a further 219 variations. The Nagor range offers another  270 different possibilities.

Boob jobs are the most popular form of plastic surgery, and the number of UK operations rose by 13 per cent in the past year.

Consultant reconstructive surgeon Ali Juma, of Breast Augment Limited, said: ‘A few years ago the implant choice was around a finite number of volumes and a single shape. Now I have a 20- to 30-page manual full of choices.’

Mr Juma said there is now  a generational divide with younger women wanting bigger breasts but older women on their second or third boob jobs seeking a more natural look.

Lara Chandler, 31, a fitness instructor from Ashford in Kent, had her first augmentation ten years ago.

She said: ‘I just walked into the clinic and said, “I want to be bigger, give me massive boobs”– as you  do when you’re young. I went from a B cup to a D. I loved it, but then I grew up and they started to really get in the way. Now I’m going for something much more natural.’

Ayse Kocak, chief executive of GC Aesthetics, said: ‘A woman should be able to work with her surgeon to select  the shape, volume and projection that most suits her individual wishes.’
