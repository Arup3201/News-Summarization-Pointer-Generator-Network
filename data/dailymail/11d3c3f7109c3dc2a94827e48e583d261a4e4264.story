Kathleen McKechnie Skifjell, 53, had stopped to buy a bottle of water when a man

A mother told how her car was stolen from a petrol station as her eight-year-old son was sound asleep in the back seat.

Kathleen McKechnie Skifjell, 53, had stopped to buy a bottle of water and didn't see a man loitering around the site waiting for his chance.

The mother-of-four left the car unlocked, and he jumped in and sped off.

The incident happened in Norway, where Ms McKechnie Skifjell and her family, originally from Stirling, Scotland, now live.

The cook, only became aware her Daewoo had vanished when she emerged from the filling station shop.

Terrified, she called the police and spent the next hour - which she described as 'the longest of her life' before discovering her son, Scott, had been found safe.

She later learned the thief had woken up Scott before dropping him off at a remote house and telling him his mother was waiting there for him.

But when Scott knocked on the door, he discovered it was the home of a family who had no idea who he was.

The couple then called the police.

Ms McKechnie Skifjell said: 'We're just lucky this thief had a conscience.

'He was obviously an opportunist who just wanted my car and must have got the shock of his life when he found Scott sleeping in the back.

'Scott doesn't remember much until he was woken by the man after he pulled up outside the house. It was about 8pm and getting dark. Scott rang the doorbell and told the couple that a man had taken his mother's car.'

The man who took the car dropped Scott off nearby. Ms McKechnie Skifjell said: 'We're just lucky this thief had a conscience'

She added: 'The couple quickly realised what was happening and called the police.

'It was the best news I've ever had. I was in shock. I was still down at the petrol station and they brought him there.

'He came out of the police car as if nothing had happened. I gave him the biggest hug ever. I couldn't believe I had him back.'

Police later found the car abandoned and undamaged.

Her purse had been emptied and her mobile phone SIM card taken. Scott's schoolbag was also stolen.

Ms McKechnie Skifjell moved to Norway 23 years ago after she met her former husband while working as a chef on the North Sea oil rigs.

She and her children Johann, 22, Anne, 19, Marie, 16 and Scott moved back to Scotland several years ago to live in Blair Drummond, near Stirling, for two years before moving back to Revetal, 55 miles south of Oslo.

Police said they had now arrested a man in connection with the incident.

A spokesman said he had told them it was not his intention to kidnap a child, but just to steal a car.
