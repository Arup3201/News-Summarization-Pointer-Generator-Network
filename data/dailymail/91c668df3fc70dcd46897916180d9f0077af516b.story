Steven Finn had the perfect word to describe himself after his mauling by Brendon McCullum when England were last here in the New Zealand capital. Finn, after disappearing for 49 in two overs, said he felt like a 'wally.'

Yet the fast bowler who has battled his way back to this World Cup after being described as 'unselectable' just over a year ago got straight back on the horse against Scotland and actually bowled as well as he has done in two years.

Now Finn, who was so good on tour in New Zealand two years ago that he was almost unplayable in the one-day internationals, feels he is back to his best after a year in which he could easily have fallen away from international cricket.

'Look, in that situation against New Zealand, McCullum was always going to come hard and it seemed that everything I tried didn't quite work,' said Finn. 'It was one of those days but I've bowled well throughout this trip and have taken wickets so I don't feel too downhearted by it.

'When you're bowling and it's disappearing over your head for six it's not a nice feeling. You feel like a wally when you're out there, but it happened and it's in the past. It's never happened to me before like that and I've got him out before.

'Usually if I try something it works but it didn't that day. It was one of those days and I'm very disappointed, gutted and embarrassed by it. Someone will come that hard at us again but we'll have to find a way of dealing with it.'

England actually deserve credit for sticking with Finn, who can be fragile in adversity, against Scotland because they could easily have replaced him with either Chris Jordan, who has impressed in practice, or James Tredwell.

Finn responded by taking three wickets to follow his hat-trick and five-wicket haul against Australia and while that in itself against Scotland was not earth shattering the way he bowled was encouraging.

'I feel normal,' he said. 'The amount of wickets I've taken over here have helped get that confidence back. And just playing international cricket and being in the set-up and round the guys day in and day out helps that confidence too. So I'm just a normal cricketer playing cricket now. That's all it is.'

And back to the old Steven Finn, one of most promising fast bowlers in world cricket? 'Yes I'd say so. Everything feels fine. It feels as though everything is going the way it was for me a couple of years ago and that's good.'

Not that his hat-trick against Australia was a typical fast bowler's one to be proud of, coming as it did to three catches in the deep off the last three balls of the innings. 'In 10 years time I'll tell people it was a classic hat-trick,' he smiled.

'I'll tell them it was three in-swinging yorkers! I was pleased to get a hat-trick and pleased to do it for England in a World Cup. But I was disappointed to do it off the last three balls of the innings. If it had happened earlier then brilliant I'd have been very happy about it.'

England looked relaxed as they returned to work at picturesque Karori Park just outside Wellington on Wednesday, where they engaged in middle practice, recreating match scenarios, rather than the net practice of the Basin Reserve.

At one point bowling coach David Saker pulled off a diving catch on the boundary to 'dismiss' Jos Buttler, causing assistant coach Paul Farbrace to shout out 'there's just been a minor earthquake.'

The more serious business came when England practiced the death bowling that came in for so much criticism against Australia, notably their apparent inability to think on their feet and repeatedly bowl too short.

'We're always looking at it and trying to improve,' said Finn. 'It's been a running theme that teams 'get met' a little bit over here at the end and we have to buck that trend. We sit down and look at it and build plans and days like today, practicing scenarios in the middle, are good. When we come to the death overs we'll have clear plans and we'll a hundred per cent try to stick to them.'

But do they stick too rigidly to them? 'Instinct is one of the most important things in cricket,' insisted Finn. 'I hate it when things are preconceived because it becomes too predictable and too obvious.

'You have to think on your feet, the best bowlers in the world do that, and find a delivery that's working on that wicket against that batsmen. That's a skill in itself and it's something we have to get better at.'

England know that a win against Sri Lanka here in a match that starts on Saturday night UK time would all but take them to the quarter-finals. 'Every game is significant for us but especially this game on Sunday because of the manner in which we got beaten in the first two games,' said Finn.

'We were expected to put in a performance against Scotland but we got beat by Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka so it's important we go out there and try to stamp our authority in conditions that should favour us.'

A win here at the Westpac Stadium where they were humiliated by New Zealand would certainly put their World Cup back on track.
