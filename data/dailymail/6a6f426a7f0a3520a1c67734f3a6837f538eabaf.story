An undiscovered part of the Staffordshire Hoard could be buried under the M6 toll road, according to the farmer whose land hid the famous treasure for centuries.

Fred Johnson, 69, became an overnight millionaire after the valuable haul of Saxon gold was unearthed on his farm in 2009.

And today he revealed soil from the fields which contained the Â£3.3 million treasure trove had been shovelled onto the site of the M6 toll road before the amazing discovery.

Mr Johnson said he had sold two acres of his land under a compulsory purchase order ahead of the motorway's 2003 opening.

His comments sparked hope of more gold existing - after 90 new pieces of gold and silver from the hoard were found just last year.

Mr Johnson split the windfall with treasure hunter Terry Herbert, 58, whose metal detector led to one of the biggest historical discoveries this century.

The pair's famously bitter relationship reached a head when Mr Johnson banned jobless Mr Herbert from his farm.

Mr Johnson said he wished the 7th century pieces had never been found - and resented the attention they had brought him.

He said: 'I wish it had been someone working who found it, I've got to be honest about that. It's a windfall but I've tried not to let it change my life.

Experts said they would be surprised if any further discoveries were made, but did not discount the prospect of more gold turning up

New finds: A selection of around 90 new pieces of gold and silver were unearthed last year in the field where the Staffordshire Hoard of Anglo-Saxon treasure was found three years ago

'I would have liked to be anonymous. I said to Terry: "Keep your head down", but he had done some interviews.

'I didn't know how to handle it. I was worried about how my friends would take it, but almost everyone has said good luck. I'm grateful for that.

'Someone asked me what it was like to suddenly become a millionaire,' he said. 'I told him I probably already was one.

'It would take more than a million for a woman to take me on.'

Experts said they would be surprised if any further discoveries were made, but did not discount the prospect of more gold turning up.

Bill Mayo, boss of nearby Brownhills Local History Society said: 'I would have thought they would have found something, but you never know.

'We never knew, when we walked the field as kids, that we were standing on millions of pounds.'
