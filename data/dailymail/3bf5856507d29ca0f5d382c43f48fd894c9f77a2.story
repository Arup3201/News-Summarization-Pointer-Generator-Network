Playing football is one of the staples of childhood in Britain.

But a top neuro-science expert has now said youngsters should be banned from heading the ball because it is too dangerous.

Dr Michael Grey, a motor neuro-science expert at the University of Birmingham, says the impact of the brain against the skull causes damage.

Children’s neck muscles are not developed enough to handle the shock of impact, he said.

Several high profile doctors have warned about children heading footballs after scans have shown apparent damage to the brains of professional players.

However research and animal experiments have resulted in mixed findings.

Dr Grey told Sky News: ‘I do not think that children should stop sport, the obesity epidemic means we need to encourage them.

‘But we do need to look at rule changes and the way we train children.

‘Children should not be heading the ball. We don’t know at what age children’s necks become strong enough to withstand the movement of the head when the head is struck by the ball.

‘Some of my colleagues have suggested 14 but I really think it is individual. In addition the brain starts to shake and rotates when the head is struck by the ball.

‘The brain bounces back and forth and it is the impact of the brain against the inside of the skull causes additional damage.’

His comments come as the Football Association issue new guidelines on concussion and head injuries.

The new rules stipulate that if a player loses consciousness they must be immediately taken off the pitch and not allowed to return to play.

But if there is not a loss of consciousness, it is up to the team doctor to decide when a player should carry on if they can should come off the field after a blow to the head.

Some schools in the US have already banned children from heading the ball during games.

An inquest into the death in 2002 of England and West Bromwich Albion footballer Jeff Astle ruled that he died from an ‘industrial disease’ – brain damage linked to heading a heavy ball throughout his career.

The new FA rules have angered the family of Astle as they have no specific guidance to heading the ball and the effect it can have.

Dawn Astle, his daughter, said: ‘We know what killed dad, the coroner’s court said it was industrial disease: heading footballs killed dad and the Football Association just don’t acknowledge it.

‘Twelve-and-a-half years on, they still haven’t acknowledged what killed him.

‘We have real worries, not just for current footballers, and of course not just professionals - we’re talking about amateurs as well - but about football’s future, about the children in the game.

‘They need to know the risks, then they can make informed choices.’

The Astle family and one of the world’s leading neuro-surgeons, Dr Willie Stewart, are meeting FA representatives including chairman Greg Dyke to persuade them of their case.

A report by MP, Chris Bryant and paralympic gold medalist and member of the House of Lords, Baroness Grey-Thompson, entitled ‘Concussion can kill’ called for a parliamentary investigation into head injuries in sport.

Published in June, the report asks if steps can be taken to limit the number of times players head the ball in football, particularly young players.

It said there should be a set of consistent guidelines across all sports to ensure concussion is diagnosed promptly and the player appropriately treated.

Dr Grey said there is new evidence coming to light showing the need to be concerned but it is a ‘difficult issue’.

Dr Grey added: ‘Our challenge is that because it is such a difficult issue. We know some people are very susceptible to getting head injuries in these situations and some are quite resilient and we don’t know why yet.’

He said parents and coaches need to be educated about secondary concussion syndrome and guidelines need to be followed.

He added: ‘In essence we need to protect players from themselves.’
