It has all come together in a few days for Danny Welbeck. At the start of last week, he was unwanted by Louis van Gaal and well down the pecking order as a centre forward for Manchester United.

A few days later, by which time he had moved to Arsenal for £16million and completed an excellent 20 minutes as a substitute with England, the outlook suddenly seemed considerably brighter.

With Olivier Giroud injured and Alexis Sanchez just as likely to play wide, he has every chance of starting down the middle against Manchester City next Saturday. And Daniel Sturridge’s injury means a similar scenario is unfolding for Monday night in England’s Euro 2016 qualifier, where he is likely to start up front with former United team-mate Wayne Rooney.

Frontman: Danny Welbeck leads the way during an England training session

The fact he has diligently performed as a wide-left midfielder probably counted against him in the past, in that he has scored only every three games when he has started in the league. But in his mind Welbeck is a centre-forward.

‘I prefer to play there, yeah,’ he said. ‘It’s up to the manager, I don’t pick the team. I can’t say I want to play here or there.’ The fact that he was answering the question sat next to the England manager is an indication of his self-confidence.

For Welbeck, 24, this does seem to be a watershed moment. Certainly for his club, and perhaps for his country, he will get his wish to carry the goal-scoring burden. As such, perhaps he can take encouragement from Sturridge, the man whose place he takes on Monday.

At Manchester City and Chelsea, Sturridge looked to be a wide player who could fill in as a centre-forward. Only when Brendan Rodgers started playing him consistently in the central role at Liverpool did he add the prolific goalscoring. Welbeck can only hope the same proves to be the case at Arsenal.

All change: Outlook suddenly seems considerably brighter for Welbeck

He said: ‘We’ll see when I get my opportunity to do that. I’ve never had the opportunity to get a run of games as a No 9 but I have faith in my ability. If I get the opportunity to do what I know I can do, then things might change. But until then I’ll work hard wherever I play.’

The stats back him up. When he has started as a centre forward for United, his goal average is 0.43 per game as opposed to 0.30.

There has always been a feeling that much of Welbeck’s best football has been in an England shirt, though he does not agree. ‘Maybe when I have been away with England and been a bit further up the pitch, it has been better for me,’ he said. ‘But I wouldn’t say typically I’ve played better for England.’

Now he is part of a generation called on to revitalise interest in the national team, a responsibility he seems keen to embrace, well aware of the negativity surrounding England since the World Cup.

Responsibility: Welbeck’s best football has been in an England shirt

‘When we get together as a group we can clarify what we think went wrong,’ he said. ‘We can speak about where we can improve and analyse how things went. We’ll all have our opinions and talk it over.

‘There are a lot of younger players than me in the squad. It’s good to see that youngsters are being given the opportunity to play in the national side. Coming to this stage of my career, I really want to push on now and be the best I can be.’

He was an integral part of England’s best period in a dismal World Cup. In the opening 35 minutes against Italy, England looked like a team who might take on the world, with Welbeck linking superbly with Sturridge and Raheem Sterling. 

Threat: Welbeck is likely to link up with Raheem Sterling and Wayne Rooney

‘I don’t think we got bullied or obliterated at the World Cup. The results didn’t go our way and it was very disappointing for us as a nation. The players really felt it. After the Uruguay game in the dressing-room it’s one of those moments you will remember and keep with you.

‘I have had plenty of those moments in my career and it has only driven me on to do better things. When we lost the league on the last day of the season [at Sunderland in 2012] with Man United and the manager [Sir Alex Ferguson] told us never to forget that moment. The next season we won the league and it’s something that is always in you, that you know what that feeling is like and you don’t want to feel it again.’

The first chance to remedy that disappointment comes in Basel. And Welbeck can expect to be central to the manager’s plans.
