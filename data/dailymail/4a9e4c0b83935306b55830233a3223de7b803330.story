On May 17, Hofstra University student Andrea Rebello, 21, was shot and killed by a Nassau County police officer during a hostage standoff with an intruder at her shared rental house in Uniondale, New York.

According to court papers submitted by the county on Thursday, the investigation into Rebello's death is 'only in it's infancy.'

Andrea Rebello's family, including her twin sister Jessica Rebello, asked for records related to the police investigation of her death and were troubled by the police department's response. 

Sisters: Jessica(left) and Andrea Rebello(right), pictured, remained in the home while another girl was allowed out to collect money from an ATM. The girl called police immediately and they arrived minutes later

'I was shocked and surprised to hear that they consider this investigation is in its infancy,' said Rebello family lawyer David Roth.

Police are refusing both records and crime scene photos.

Public officials blame numerous record requests for causing, 'confusion with the county agencies that got them.'

Newsday reports that The Rebello family already announced that they plan to sue the county for killing their daughter in the shooting that also killed the home-intruder, Dalton Smith.

Police say that Smith held Rebello in
 a headlock and pointed a gun to her head. Officer Nikolas Budimlic 
approached Smith who then allegedly pointed a gun at the officer. Budimlic fired killing Smith with seven bullets and killing Rebello with one.

Dalton Smith, 30, who had a history of criminal behavior, also died in the shooting

Carnell Foskey, a Nassau County Attorney, said that officials did their best to comply with the Robello family's record requests but that some records were exempt.

The Robello family's attorney David Roth said that Jessica, who was inside the house at the time of the shooting, spoke with police on the day of the incident but hasn't since, 'essentially because of the way they treated her.'

Rebello
was in the two-story home with her twin sister Jessica, another woman 
and another man when Smith, wearing a ski mask, walked into the
house through an open front door,  Lt. John Azzata said.

The intruder allowed the
third unidentified woman to leave and collect money from an ATM, and 
she called 911.

Police announced that Dalton Smith, 30, was wanted on a parole 
violation related to a first-degree robbery conviction and had an arrest
history dating back nearly 15 years.

Two police officers arriving at the home encountered Smith holding onto Rebello.

Smith, 30, of Hempstead, had a warrant put out for his arrest on April 25.

He had been found guilty of robbery 
in the 1st degree and had an extensive criminal background going back to
1999 with multiple convictions for theft and assault.He also spent time in prison and was convicted again for handling contraband goods while behind bars.

He
 was shot by police on May 17 after what appears to be an attempted 
robbery on Rebello, her twin and their friends. Earlier reports said 
that the man shot Andrea Rebello as she pleaded for her life.

The 30-year-old followed the sisters, Jessica and Andrea, Jessica's boyfriend John Kourtessiss and another student called Shannon Thomas back to the girls' California Avenue sorority house from the popular student bar, McHebes, according to The New York Post.

The gunman reportedly targeted the students after seeing them spending large amounts of money in the drinking spot to celebrate the end of the school term.

Around
 2:20am he allegedly peered through the window in his ski mask and 
knocked on the door before forcing himself in and taking the group 
hostage.

Raiding the 
home he shouted: 'I saw you at the bar drinking. I know you have more 
money than this!', according to police sources quoted in the Post 
report.

He made the twins remain but told 
Thomas to leave and withdraw money from an ATM machine - warning her he 
would shoot her friends if she tried anything. 

While away from the home she called 911. 

As police arrived neighbors said they heard blood-curdling screams and what sounded like a woman pleading for her life.

Victoria Dehel, who lives four doors down told the New York Times that she heard shouting.

At first is sounded like 'a bunch of drunk college students,' she told the Times.

'And then the screaming just got worse and worse and worse. And then we heard thuds, like five bangs,' she said.

Dehel
said she and her boyfriend stepped onto their porch and they could hear
what sounded like a woman pleading for her life, just as police cars 
raced down the street.

'I turned to my boyfriend and I said, 'I think someone just got murdered'. It was awful,' she said.

'[Police] drew their weapons and went inside,' neighbor Frank Pugliese, 19 told the Post.

'She was pleading for her life. You could tell she was scared. It
was a surreal moment . . . She was pleading — her voice was trembling 
and she yelled, ‘No, no!’ '

Smith is believed to have held them on the second floor.

Thomas told the 911 dispatcher that he had a silver handgun pointed 
at her friend's head in a bedroom, NBC reported.

Break in: Police said that the masked, armed intruder knocked on the front door before forcing his way inside the home and holding the friends, including Andrea (left), hostage

The dispatcher passed the information to police and less than a minute later, Nassau
County police officers reached the home. 

When they arrived, shots went off. A law enforcement source told the New York Post it appeared the suspect killed Rebello and the police then killed him but this timetable of events was still being verified.

'We
don't know [the suspect's] motive at this time but it appears to be a 
robbery,' Chief Rick Capece said in a press conference shortly after the incident.

Anthony Kourtessiss said his son was being questioned by police after the shooting and Jessica was 'inconsolable'.

'It’s a terrible situation,' he told the newspaper. '[Jessica] was very upset, inconsolable right now.'

Rebello was a member of the Beta Sigma Phi 
sorority and lived with six of her sorority sisters at the home, including her sister.

Students
flocked to Twitter to express their grief at the killing, with many 
writing 'R.I.P' messages to Andrea and sending her twin sister their 
best wishes and prayers

A private vigil was held at the 
Hofstra Student Center and her funeral took place the next Wednesday.

Rebello's
father, Fernando, was too distraught to discuss the incident outside 
the family's home in Tarrytown, New York, yesterday.

'It's my daughter, my baby daughter,' the landscaping company chief told the Journal News outside the home he shares with wife Nella. 

'She was so beautiful. I'm so confused. 'I don't know what to do,' he added.

Her godmother told the newspaper: 'It's just too tragic'.

Andrea was
a junior at Hofstra studying Public Relations and Sociology and had attended Sleepy Hollow High School alongside her sister.

'I'm 100% Portuguese and have an identical twin sister so I guess that makes me kind of unique?' she wrote on her blog.

Principal Carol Conklin-Spillane
said the girls were 'a set' and Andrea was devoted to her family who 
are close to other members of the Portuguese community in the area. 

'She had a devotion to family and sense of purpose and of opportunity,' she said.

Friends and family attended her funeral on May 22 and deeply mourned her loss

Photographs
on her Facebook page show the girl as a popular student who enjoyed 
hanging out with friends and her twin sister, while her blog documents 
her cooking hobby.

Neighbors said their house had a vegetable garden and the twins would sometimes drop off the produce.

'They brought me some vegetables from their garden. They’re very nice people. They’d do anything for you,' Harris Bank told the New York Post.

Family members of slain Hofstra coed gave their final goodbyes at an
emotional funeral service at New York's St. Teresa of Avila Church church on May 22 .

The victim’s distraught twin
sister who is unable to eat and keeps keeps asking how she could have prevented
the tragedy.

'During this 
tragedy a question comes to mind - why?' Reverand Osvaldo Franklin said.
'Why Andrea, in the flower of her youth, she left us?'

As the crowd sobbed, lohud.com reports, Franklin tried to offer comfort, if not an answer.

'She has left us to join our father in heaven,' Franklin said. 'We are here to pray for the family that she left behind.'

The New York police union has defended Budimlic by  saying the only person responsible for the woman's death was the gunman who held her hostage.

'There
is some second guessing by people who think we should have stayed 
outside the house, but our job is to get inside and make sure we can 
protect as many people as we can,' said James Carver.

But Andrea's grandfather questioned the protocol the officer was following.

'I think the police is not very professional,' Santos said. 'If he's professional, he should have tried negotiation.'

The Nassau County Police Department refused to comment when the Mail Online asked whether or not Nikolas Budimlic was on leave or still currently employed.
