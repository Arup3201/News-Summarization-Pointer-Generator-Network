Murdered Crimewatch presenter Jill Dando tried to get BBC bosses to investigate an alleged paedophile ring in the corporation, it has today been claimed.

A former friend and retired BBC worker has claimed that the television host was told that 'big name stars' and BBC staff were involved in abuse.

But when she tried to get her superiors to investigate, and handed a file to senior management, no action was taken, the source claims.

Murdered Crimewatch presenter Jill Dando tried to get BBC bosses to investigate an alleged paedophile ring in the corporation, it has today been claimed

The former staff member, who asked to remain anonymous, told the Daily Star Sunday that she raised the claims with management in the mid 1990s.

The source said that the names were 'surprisingly big'.

She said: 'I think she was quite shocked when told about images of children and that information on how to join this horrible paedophile ring was freely available.'

They added that Ms Dando had also been told that female work colleagues told her they had been groped or assaulted, and that nothing had been done.

'She compiled a file of complaints but she was not really an investigative journalist, just a presenter.

'She passed the information to someone else and they gave it back. No one wanted to know.'

The BBC said it had not seen anything to substantiate the claims.

Miss Dando, 37, was gunned down outside her home in Fulham, west London, on April 26, 1999, moments after stepping out of her car.

Dando was killed with a single muffled bullet to the skull and neighbours found her in a pool of blood on her doorstep in a crime that shocked Britain.

Part-time stuntman Barry George was jailed for the killing in 2001, but his conviction was overturned in August 2008 following the emergence of fresh evidence.

Her killer has never been found.Â
