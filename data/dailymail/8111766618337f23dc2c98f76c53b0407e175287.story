In recent weeks, Mitt Romney’s campaign has had to do significant damage control following the release of a leaked video.

Now, a video from 2005, surfaced by Buzzfeed, shows another apparent gaffe from the then governor of Massachusetts.

In the closing remarks while at the St. Patrick’s Day breakfast, the GOP hopeful said, ‘When I was a boy, I used to think that becoming rich and becoming famous would make me happy. Boy, was I right.’

Conclusion: At the end, Mr Romney remarked: 'When I was a boy, I used to think that becoming rich and becoming famous would make me happy. Boy, was I right'

Leaked: The video comes after Mother Jones leaked footage from an anonymous person who attended a fundraiser in Florida where Mr Romney said 47 per cent of Americans believed themselves to be 'entitled'

The video was from a comedy breakfast on St. Patrick’s Day in 2005, showing a less-grey Romney, wearing a green tie and an Irish-themed boutonniere. 

According to a 2005 article from the Boston Globe, Mr Romney had joked with local politicians at the light-hearted breakfast, the Boston equivalent of the White House Correspondent’s Dinner.

When Mr Romney said, ‘I’ll be here until you get funny,’ then-speaker and Democrat Salvatore DiMasi quipped back: ‘You being president of the United States. That’s a joke.’

While this clip is innocuous enough when viewed on its own, it adds to the pressure Mr Romney’s already facing over his newly-released 2011 tax returns, as well as the now-infamous leaked tape in which he said that 47 per cent was ‘dependent’ on the government and didn’t pay federal taxes.

Mr Romney, flanked by vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan, are campaigning in the crucial swing state of Ohio, where they are hoping to gain the necessary electoral college votes to secure the seat of the White House.

Quiet time: Romney took a moment Tuesday on his campaign bus to sit in silence

According to Politico, new polling shows that President Obama is quickly gaining ground in the state, leading by eight per cent.

On Wednesday, Mr Obama will visit the college towns of Kent and Bowling Green, and Romney's bus tour will stop in the Columbus, Cleveland and Toledo areas.

Still, the Fox News poll suggests there's room for Romney to advance. Nearly one in three Ohio voters said they are 'not at all satisfied' with the way things are going in the country, and an additional 26 per cent are 'not very satisfied.' 

Only seven per cent are 'very satisfied,' and 34 per cent are 'somewhat satisfied.'

Mr Romney is trying to tap that discontent. But he's having mixed success with his chief target: white, working-class voters who are socially conservative and often have union backgrounds. A generation ago they were called 'Reagan Democrats.'

The Washington Post poll showed that 36 per cent of all Ohio voters said they had been contacted by the Obama campaign, and 29 per cent said they had heard from Romney's camp.

Romney campaign political director Rich Beeson told reporters Tuesday that Romney's campaign has 40 offices in Ohio to Obama's 100, but he said Republicans are keeping pace.

'We have an equal number of contacts on the ground,' Mr Beeson said. He urged reporters and others to 'take into account the quality of the contacts, the number of contacts, not just the staff and offices.'

Mr Beeson said Romney has one pitch for all of Ohio's voters: America can't afford four more years of Obama. 'We don't have to go in and package a message to different groups,' Mr Beeson said.

Pro-Romney TV ads, however, target voters in the coal-rich eastern part of the state with spots criticizing Obama's environmental regulations affecting coal-fired power plants. 

And other Ohio working-class voters are courted in GOP ads saying Obama hasn't been tough enough on China's protection of its exporters.
