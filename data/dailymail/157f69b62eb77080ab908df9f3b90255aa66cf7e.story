A mother whose son was taken to hospital after having his chest stamped on by bullies has been hit with an electronic tag and curfew for removing him from the school.

Yasmin Dad, 46, says her son Rahim, 13, experienced a series of violent attacks at the hands of his tormentors over more than a year at the school in Bristol.

On one occasion the police had to be called in and she claims the teenager was subjected to racist abuse and threatening text messages. She says that another time she found her son cowering in an alleyway after being set upon.

But after Mrs Dad removed Rahim from school to protect him from the bullies, she was hauled before the courts for allowing him to be truant.

'Protective': Yasmin Dad with her son Rahim, 13. She has been tagged and hit with a curfew after keeping him home from school because he was being bullied

She was warned she could go to jail 
and has been given a three months deferred sentence, forced to wear a 
tag and must not go out after 7pm.

Mrs Dad now says she has been 'unfairly punished' for being a 'good parent'.

She said: 'The way I have been punished for protecting my own child is appalling.

'However the tagged curfew doesn’t 
just punish me, it also punishes my kids because I can’t take them out 
without being worried that I must be back by 7pm.

'I don’t know why they are punishing 
me for raising the issue of bullying. By punishing me they have solved 
nothing. I did the right thing by protecting my son.

'It was not that I did not know where he was or that he was going out committing crime.

Traumatic: Henbury school in Bristol, where Rahim was a pupil before his mother withdrew him after he endured bullying

Tormentors: Yasmin Dad claims her son was repeatedly bullied while he attended school, and was attacked on four different occasions (file picture posed by models)

'I should not have been punished for being a good mother.'

Mrs Dad repeatedly took Rahim out of 
Henbury School where she had claimed he was subjected to a catalogue of 
physical and verbal attacks.

In
May, Yasmin told a court that over 15 months 
Rahim was attacked four times - once so badly he was left in hospital 
and on another occasion so badly that the school’s police officer was 
called in.

He was also sent threatening text messages, which included racial abuse against Pakistanis.

At the time Henbury School’s head 
teacher Clare Bradford acknowledged there had been issues with Rahim but
that strenuous efforts had been made to work with his family to both 
resolve those issues and his poor attendance.

Since June 11 Rahim has been at Oasis 
Academy Brightstowe in Shirehampton where she says he has had no 
problems with bullies and has a 100 per cent attendance record.

Treatment: Mrs Dad said that Rahim was taken to hospital after bullies stamped on his chest in an attack at Blaise Castle in Bristol

At the case earlier this year, Bristol Magistrates’ Court 
heard that Mrs Dad had repeatedly failed to ensure Rahim went to school, and 
that he only attended on 42 out of 224 occasions between October 13, 
2010 and December 9, 2011.

Prosecuting, Ashley Clark told the court stringent measures were in place to prevent further bullying.

She said attempts had been made to 
contact Ms Dad to get Rahim into a different school, but she hadn’t 
responded and failed to attend meetings.

Defending, Ruth Tily said Rahim was 
removed from the school in October 2010 after his chest was stamped on, 
leaving him in hospital. In April 2011 he was removed for six months 
when his mother found him cowering in an alleyway in tears after he was 
attacked by bullies at Blaise Castle.

Punishment: An electronic police tag similar to the one Mrs Day has had to wear for keeping her bullied son from school

Mrs Dad was warned in December about 
his attendance, so sent him back to school in January, but took him out 
again after he was beaten up twice in just a week.

The mother pleaded guilty to failing to ensure his attendance at school for a total period of 360 days. Her sentence was deferred for three months.

Mrs Dad was sentenced earlier this month, and after being warned she could have gone to jail, was handed an eight-week tagged curfew from 7pm to 6am and must pay £85 court costs.

Yasmin said she now hopes to set up a group where other parents who feel they have been wrongly punished by the courts over truancy can share their experiences.

She said: 'I have a conviction for protecting my child and I am sure I’m not the only one.

'I am sure many parents are punished for doing exactly the same thing and trying to ensure their child is safe and gets a decent education.

'There are thousands of children who are still not attending school so how are these prosecutions even working?

'People who are being bullied are told not to suffer in silence but when I decided to do something about it I found myself facing a prison sentence and now have a conviction.

'I think the council prosecute and pat themselves on the back instead of actually addressing the underlying problems. The law treats me and many other parents like we don’t care about our children. Cases should be considered on merit.'
