Two mysterious safes that have lain unopened in a municipal building for at least a generation will be unlocked this month.

The safes are in an old Jersey City vault that has 
been turned into a storage and file room.

City officials say they were probably installed in the middle part of the last century, but 
they have no idea exactly when, or which mayor ordered their 
installation - or what is in them.

Two mysterious safes in an old Jersey City vault that has been turned into a storage and file room are to be opened

And when newly-elected Mayor Steve Fulop found them he was intrigued, and ordered them to be opened, NJ.com reported.

Fulop said he has spoken to former Mayors Gerry McCann and Jerry Healy, who each said they knew nothing about the history of the safe and never tried to open it.

'We don't know when the safes were installed or what they were used for but they are quite old,' Fulop said.

'None of the living mayors we spoke to recall them ever being opened or used. We thought it would be interesting to find out what may be inside and will have a professional open the safes.

'Jersey City's political history makes you wonder why a safe - much less two - was installed in the mayor's office.'

Among the colourful former mayors of Jersey City are Frank Hague, who was known as 'the granddaddy of New Jersey Bosses' and served from 1917 to 1947, and Bernard Berry, who served from 1953 to 1957 and tried to ban rock and roll music from within the city limits.

Former city employees say the safes always had rumours around them, one being that Hague used them to store kickbacks received from city workers.

Healy, who preceded Fulop as mayor and served two terms, said he never gave the safes much thought and never tried to open them.  As far as he knows, none of his predecessors did either.

'I've never been in the safe and I have no idea how far back it goes,' Healy said.  'I don't think anybody's been in it in years.  That was from the good old days or 'bad' old days when there was more money floating around city hall.'

Former Mayor Gerry McCann, who served two non-consecutive terms in office first in the early 1980s and later in the early 1990s said he remembers the safes but has no idea what might be in them.

He's not sure if he opened either of them during his tenure, but if he did, it didn't leave an impression.

'I don't know if we opened them, I don't remember.  If we did, I don't remember anything in it,' McCann said.

He said the safes were much like Hague's desk, which still sits in city hall.  The desk, which has a two way drawer that opens outward to anyone facing its occupant – rumored to be Hague's preferred way to collect cash payouts – has been in use in the municipal building for the better part of a century.

'Everybody thought Hague's desk was a big deal, but I didn't want it, it was a ratty old desk,' he said.

Healy said, while definitely intriguing it's probably not wise to go all Geraldo Rivera over them.

'They're probably empty,' he said.  'That's my guess.'

Fulop said the city will contract a locksmith to open them sometime next month.
