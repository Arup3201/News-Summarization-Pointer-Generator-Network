He had spent three months locked up with ‘murderers, drug dealers and rapists’ as a result of a bitter £400million divorce wrangle.

So Scot Young, who claims to have lost more than a stone in weight while inside, was clearly keen to make up for lost time.

The day after he left Pentonville Prison, cigarette in hand and Louis Vuitton designer bag slung over his shoulder, the former property tycoon was back on the society party circuit with girlfriend Noelle Reno.

Young, 51, who served three months of a six-month sentence for failing to reveal his financial secrets to his ex-wife, was sporting newly cropped hair – and the same battered leather jacket – as he attended an art exhibition in Soho with the 29-year-old model.

A former fixer to the super-rich, he has been locked in a bitter legal battle with his ex-wife Michelle over her divorce settlement following their separation in 2006.

Mrs Young, 48, a former model, insists her ex-husband is still worth up to £400million but has hidden his fortune to avoid his ‘obligations’ to her and their two children.

He is adamant that he was left penniless by a disastrous Moscow property deal, but was jailed in January after a High Court judge ruled he had refused to reveal how £400million had apparently vanished overnight.

Mr Justice Moor jailed him for ‘flagrant and deliberate’ contempt of court. His release on Monday infuriated his ex-wife, who insisted he should have been kept in jail.

Mrs Young told the Daily Mail: ‘He’s still in contempt of court. How can the justice system let him take one step out of prison without him disclosing the whereabouts of the £400million?

He should have stayed in there until he purged his contempt. It’s outrageous that he’s out celebrating.’

She has accused her ex-husband of continuing to enjoy a lavish lifestyle while owing more than £1million in maintenance for her and their daughters Scarlet, 20, and Sasha, 18.

Mrs Young’s lawyers allege a forensic accountant has found ‘significant evidence’ to show Young was not insolvent, as he has claimed.

They are studying documents that reportedly claim he constructed a secret network of offshore companies to hold his assets.

Mrs Young obtained a High Court order in 2007 which forbids him from selling or moving any disputed assets.

She alleges that associates including the late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky, found hanged at his Ascot mansion last month, helped him to hide the money.

Young has accused her of pursuing him in court out of spite, and described the decision to jail him as ‘ridiculous’.

Speaking earlier this year, he said: ‘I can’t believe I’m locked up with murderers, drug dealers and rapists for 22 hours a day over a matrimonial matter.’

The couple married in 1995 and lived in a £14million Oxfordshire mansion. Young once bought her a Range Rover filled with couture dresses and gave her £1million in Graff diamond jewellery for her 40th birthday.

Their legal battle will resume later this year, with Young facing possible further action for contempt if he fails to reveal details of his finances.
