The transgender woman held as a sex slave in rural Louisiana for two years had been branded by her captors with a bar code tattoo and registered on a website as their property, investigators have revealed.

The woman, who hasn’t been named, was found with a logging chain wrapped around her on the side of a highway in Natchitoches Parish last week.

According to authorities, the Minnesota woman had been branded on the back of her neck by her captors - David Rodriguez Jr., 37, and his wife Christina Harper, 39 - not long after she had moved in with them.

Greg Dunn, chief investigator for the Natchitoches Parish Sheriff’s Office said the tattoo was the couple's way of staking the victim as their property.

‘Then with your iPhone, you scan the bar code and it shows on the website that [the woman] is registered with Rodriguez and Harper,' Dunn told the Star Tribune.

Also arrested was Ambre Tubbs Lomas, 39, of Shreveport, suspected joining in with Rodriguez and Harper of abusing the woman.

The defendants 'actually believe that their lifestyle is normal, just like our lifestyle is normal,' Dunn added.

'They see no remorse… and they believe we don’t understand them. They are very comfortable and confident that they are doing the right thing.'

Rodriguez and Harper have each been charged with human trafficking, aggravated second-degree battery, second-degree kidnapping/false imprisonment and offenses against computer users.

They and Lomas remained jailed on Monday. Bond was set for Rodriguez and Harper at $635,000 each. Lomas was charged with second-degree kidnapping/false imprisonment and aggravated second-degree battery. Her bond was set at $525,000.

Rodriguez has a criminal history, Dunn said, but ‘not anything like these charges.’ He said there’s no criminal history discovered for Harper or Lomas.

The woman met her captors on a BDSM website and decided to move from her home in Minnesota to live with them.

Though Rodriguez allegedly helped her move in, she told police she was forced to give him her money and her Harley Davidson motorcycle.

Authorities say she was forced to sleep in a 3-by-5 wooden box.

'In this particular case, the victim probably had some depression, going through the sex change, being disowned by her family,' said Natchitoches Parish Sheriff's Office criminal investigator Carey Etheredge.

'Suspects prey on people in this situation. They know how to talk to them, what to say to them to make them feel comfortable and make them think they’re coming to live a different life.'

The woman was forced to perform sex acts, along with serving food and beverages, completing yardwork and working on a swimming pool, she told police.

If she refused, Rodriguez, Harper and Lomas allegedly beat her and carved markings into her body, police said. The trio also allegedly tazed her and threw urine on her.

Evidence: Authorities recovered multiple firearms and digital equipment when they executed a search warrant on the couple's home

Police have said that the relationship was consensual at one point, but they do not know which acts the victim was forced into.

When the woman said she wanted to leave, 'they chained her outside for two days and nights, nude, in the woods - no food, no water,' detective Tim Key said. 'And then she was put in a storage building in the yard.'

She escaped and drove one of the suspects' cars before she approached the assistant town marshal.

The victim remains in protective custody at an undisclosed location in Louisiana, and 'we are providing services to assist her,' Dunn added.

'She will be taken care of, with psychological help as well as other needs to get her back on her feet.'

Deputies recovered 15 guns, a stun gun, and digital equipment when they searched the home on Wednesday.

Two teenage children, aged 15 and 16, were also removed from the home and placed in child protective services. They are Harper’s children from a relationship before Rodriguez.

Harper's Facebook page has several Bit Strip animated memes that appear to show her and Lomas abusing their victim.

One shows Harper whipping the victim and comes with the tag that the victim 'thinks Christina is a real slave driver.'

Harper and Lomas' social media profiles include jokey Bitstrips memes with the women as cartoon characters, and include references to beatings, whippings and death.

Multiple images, some of which were uploaded by their alleged victim, show the woman as the recipient of abuse.

Macabre: Another meme appeared online showing Lomas apparently trying to hide Harper's dead body in a wooden box...not unlike the 3-by-5-foot box their alleged victim slept in

Harper is referred to as 'a real slave-driver' as she whips the woman in a cartoon while dressed as an Egyptian pharaoh. Another image shows her stuck in a fiery pit as Satan looks on.

Other memes show Lomas and Harper apparently abusing one another.

One image shows Lomas as a circus master getting ready to whip Harper, as if she is an animal performing. The caption reads 'Ambre ties to tame the wild Christina.'

A different meme shows Lomas trying to stuff an apparently dead Harper into a trunk.

Lomas' Facebook page also shows an interest in Gothic music and rock. She uploaded photos of herself dressed as a nun with heavy eyeliner when she reportedly attended a concert for Gothic metal band Ghost last month.
