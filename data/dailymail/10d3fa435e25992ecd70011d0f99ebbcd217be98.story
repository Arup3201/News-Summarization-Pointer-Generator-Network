This is the jaw-some moment a lucky seal manages to overturn the odds and escape from a Great White - after balancing on its nose.

Photographer David 'Baz' Jenkins, 41, spotted the near-death battle while on board a Great White shark tour boat off the coast of Cape Town, South Africa.

As these amazing photographs show one seal escaped the jaws of death after balancing on the massive sharks nose just inches from rows and rows of razor sharp teeth.

Jaws-dropping moment: The seal leans on the tip of the nose of a great white shark, off the coast of South Africa

The chase is on: The seal narrowly evades being crushed by the jaws of the shark

Making waves: The seal desperately jumps away from the fearsome predator as the tour group look on

Heavy-going: Great White sharks can tip the scales at 5,000Ibs

Return journey: Photographer David Jenkins said the seals were making their way back to Seal Island after feeding when the Great White pounced

Size matters: Great White sharks can reach 20ft in length

Brush with death: The seal must use all its skill if it wants to live

Make it snappy: The fearsome shark leaps out of the water in a bid to snare its prey

David, 41, from Dublin, Ireland, said ‘The seals were making their way back to Seal Island after feeding out at sea and the sharks travel below them.

‘The sharks are really well camouflaged due to their dark backs and when the seal looks down it is hard to make out the shark in the dark below.

‘When the shark picks its time to attack, it can accelerate at around 25mph upwards which can send both the shark and the seal flying up out of the water.

Looking sharp: The shark bears its huge teeth as it chases the petrified seal

Fin-tastically fast: Great White sharks can reach speeds of 25mph as they breach the surface while hunting

Gape Town: The Great White opens wide - but the seal is still outwitting it

Hunger games: The shark comes within a whisker of its lunch yet again

Seal the deal? Not quite, with the shark failing yet again to secure a meal

Sea-ing is believing: The seal seems destined to be swallowing whole

Great escape: But then the seal leans on the tip of the nose of the shark before making its bid for freedom

‘I have seen a shark lose a tooth on a decoy breach before but never when attacking and killing a real seal.

‘The breaching sharks are amazing, the speed and agility just takes your breath away as they can explode from below without warning.

‘This seal was one lucky pup.’

The Great White shark is the world's largest predatory fish - measuring up to 20 foot in length and weighing around 5,000lbs - and can leave the water completely when attacking prey.
