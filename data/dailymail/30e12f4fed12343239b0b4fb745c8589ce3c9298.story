A pensioner has been killed after he was trapped between a static caravan and a 4x4 at a campsite.

The 65-year-old man was injured when he was standing outside the caravan and was hit by the silver Daihatsu Terios on Sunday night.

Fire crews tried to free the man from the accident at the East Balthangie campsite in Aberdeenshire, but died of his injuries at the scene.

Smash: The pensioner was trapped between a Daihatsu Terios and a static caravan

Police cordoned off the area as investigators worked to establish the cause of the crash and interviewed other holidaymakers who may have witnessed the incident.

The widow of the unnamed pensioner is believed to have remained at the caravan site, and relatives are travelling there to comfort her.

The damaged 4x4 was left resting against the side of the caravan today, but the camping ground remained open while police investigated.

A spokesman for Police Scotland said: 'About 2035 hours on Sunday 21 July 2013, Police Scotland, Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and the Ambulance Service were called to a caravan and camp site at East Balthangie, Cuminestown, Turriff where a 65-year-old male pedestrian had been struck by a car.

'The pedestrian died from his injuries at the scene. Police Scotland are making enquiry into the circumstances.'

Investigation: The area has been sealed off while police work to establish the cause of the accident

Horror: The victim's wife has remained at the campsite in the aftermath of the accident

The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said fire crews had battled to save the pensioner as with paramedics rushed to the scene.

An SFRS spokesman said: 'Firefighters were quickly on scene and immediately worked on stabilising the vehicle which had collided with a static caravan.

'Working closely with colleagues from the Police and Ambulance Service, firefighters used airbags to lift the vehicle and release the trapped man.

Efforts: The emergency services were unable to save the man's life after arriving on the scene

'However, despite the quick actions and best efforts of all the emergency service personnel involved, the man died from his injuries at the scene.'

Local station manager Paul Geddes added: 'Our firefighters worked in a very professional manner under difficult circumstances and worked closely with our colleagues from the ambulance service to release the man quickly.

'Our thoughts are with the family of the gentleman who lost his life.'
