Authorities in Florida are taking special measures in the release Casey Anthony in the wake of growing fears for her safety.

In a statement, Orange County authorities said that due to the 'emotional interest by the public' they will be taking extra care when they release Anthony next Sunday.

The news comes as the 25-year-old – who just days ago was facing the death penalty - will be released after being stunningly acquitted of the murder of her two-year-old daughter Caylee.

But as the young Florida woman finally walks free after what will have been 1,043 days in prison, the public outrage at the verdict in one of the country's most high profile trials ever means she will face constant security fears.

All smiles: Casey Anthony looked relaxed as she learnt that she will be released, but there are concerns for her safety

In a statement Orange County Corrections Department said:  'Due to the high profile nature of this case and intense, emotional interest by the public, appropriate measures will be taken to release the individual into the community in such a manner so as to preserve the safety of the individual and the public.'

Anthony smiled and winked to lawyers at her sentencing yesterday as she was told that despite being given a four-year jail term, she would be released in just days, because of time already served and good behaviour.

Wearing her hair down and looking more relaxed than she did while sat in the same Orlando court room during her sensational six-week trial, Anthony seemed like she was a woman preparing for release.

Jailhouse letters reveal that Anthony has been dreaming of this moment for years, planning holidays on the beach, salon days to have her nails painted and just routine trips to the supermarket.

'Girl, I could use a day at Target myself,' she wrote to one fellow inmate. 'Just to walk around the store, to be a part of society. I want to go grocery shopping.'

'Color on my toesies and acrylic nails - yes please,' she added. 'I want to embrace the many joys of being a lady.'

Shock: Disbelief can be seen on the faces of people in the crowd outside the Orange County Courthouse. One spectator held up a sign calling Casey a 'Baby Killer'

When Casey Anthony is released on Sunday she will be bound by the rules of her probation for one year, for a cheque-fraud charge she pleaded guilty to in 2010.

Court documents reveal that the she must:

But the reality is that Anthony has 
become the most vilified woman in America, condemned as a compulsive 
liar and a heartless mother who partied and paraded herself in a 'hot 
body' competition in the days after her daughter's death.

She will never be able to live an anonymous life as a regular member of society again. Her defence team admitted they have fears for her safety and are considering hiring round-the-clock bodyguards.

Outside the Orange County Courthouse yesterday as the date of Anthony's release was announced, the public's anger and disbelief was evident as protesters gathered to express their fury.

The baying mob carried placards marked 'Why does Casey get to have a life?' and 'The jury got it wrong'. They repeated chants of 'Justice for Caylee, Justice for Caylee.'

'I feel she got away with murder and it really irritates me,' said Donna Marini, who has attended most of the trial proceedings.

Public outrage has been building since Anthony was acquitted in one of the most controversial verdicts since the OJ Simpson case.

Judge Belvin Perry pointed to the risk of reprisals for people involved in the contentious case this afternoon when he extended a ban on the identifying on jurors.

He said: 'Our landscape in this country has changed. People have no reservation…about walking up to an individual, pulling a gun or knife….and because they disagree with them, hurt them or kill them.'

Inside prison, Anthony spent nearly three years locked up 23 hours a day in protective custody, to prevent her being attacked.

But outside, officials have refused to confirm how Anthony will be kept safe.

Dreams of freedom: Casey Anthony wrote from jail that she is looking forward to re-joining society

Anthony's lawyer Jose Baez, who was at the centre of her shocking court victory, last night admitted he was scared for his client's safety.

'I am afraid for her,' he told Barbara Walters. 'And I don't think it's fair.'

The real risk of retribution against the national hate figure means her defence team are looking at the possibility of getting her constant protection and a team of bodyguards.

It is not clear where Anthony will go when she steps out of jail. Her parents, with whom she lived before her arrest, yesterday said they have still not decided if they will ever welcome her back.

It seems impossible that she could 
return to her parents' Florida home, after the trial ripped the family 
apart with allegations of rape, incest and adultery.

Tragedy: Many are angry that Casey Anthony has been cleared of the murder of her daughter

Anthony's parents have themselves become the subject of death threats since the jury read out its not guilty verdict.

George and Cindy Anthony, who were the first to leave the courtroom on Tuesday, looking stony-faced, still have not had contact with their daughter since the decision.

'It's still sinking in,' their lawyer Mark Lippman told the Today Show this morning, adding that his clients had been through 'three years of a living hell'.

The couple stood by their daughter from the day of her arrest in 2008 to the start of her trial. But on the opening day, Anthony's defence team told the court how George Anthony had molested his daughter as a child and forced her into covering up the death of two-year-old Caylee.

The Anthonys said that their reputations have been 'destroyed' by the claims. 'Their lives will never be the same. This case has destroyed everybody's reputations,' said Mr Lippman.

In Casey's handwritten jailhouse letters, she revealed that she had been thinking about creating a new identity.

'If you could change your name to any name, what would it be?' she wrote in one letter. 'I've been thinking about that a lot lately.'

But whatever steps Anthony takes to try to protect her safety, as she prepares for her release, she knows she will never have the freedom she dreamed of.
