A girl with a food phobia has lived off a diet of chips and cheese for five years - because she claims anything else makes her feel sick.

Jennifer Radigan, 17, eats mostly oven chips and is so repulsed by the thought of eating meat and vegetables she apparently heaves at the sight of them.

The teenager, from Galston, in East Ayrshire, Scotland, claims she hasn't been able to finish a proper meal in years - and can only extend her diet to the occasional bowl of pasta or boiled potatoes.

Phobia: Jennifer Radigan, 17, eats mostly oven chips because she finds the thought of eating meat and vegetables 'repulsive'

Worrying: Jennifer's eating habits, thought to be one the main reasons she regularly faints in public, have caused her weight to plummet to just 6st 10lbs

Jennifer, who started refusing food from a very early age, said she used to be so ashamed of her phobia she would starve herself at school, then later lie to her parents that she had eaten.

The college student is thought to suffer from a condition known as Selective Eating Disorder.

This causes sufferers to be anxious or nauseous when they're presented with new or feared food, leaving them at greater risk of extreme weight loss and malnutrition.

Jennifer's eating habits, thought to be one the main reasons she regularly faints in public, have caused her weight to plummet to just 6st 10lbs.

At just 5ft tall, this means her BMI of 18.4. is below the healthy range.

The teenager said: 'I used to live off mostly chicken, but now the smell makes me sick.

'It feels like the older I get, the fewer foods I can actually stomach, but I can't go wrong with chips and cheese.

'But they have to be McCain oven chips. 

'It affects my everyday life, not so much the eating around people or out, but the symptoms that come with the health issues it has caused.

'I can't go one day without feeling completely exhausted or ill at at-least one point. It's like a never ending cycle of hell.'

Although Jennifer was a fussy eater throughout her childhood, it wasn't until she turned 16 that she realised her eating habits had spiralled out of control.

But it was only when she smashed her head on a concrete floor after fainting on her first day of work experience that she decided to go to the doctors for help.

Tests revealed she was deficient in iron and vitamin B12. 

Doctors then suggested Jennifer's food phobia could be Selective Eating Disorder and have referred her to a specialist for formal diagnosis.

Fussy: Jennifer will usually skip breakfast, have a plate of chips and cheese for lunch at college and pick at whatever her mother Karen, 41 (pictured) makes her for dinner 

She said: 'I've fainted a total of five times now, and each time was different.

'One time I was shaking and when I came round I was still shaking - it was terrifying.

'I find myself getting very easily upset by it. I'll look in the mirror and think "I'm nothing but skin and bones" and "is this how people see me?"'

Jennifer will usually skip breakfast, have a plate of chips and cheese for lunch at college and pick at whatever her mother Karen, 41, puts in front of her at dinner.

The British Journal of Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry has described Selective Eating Disorder (SED) as: ‘A little-studied phenomenon of eating a highly limited range of foods, associated with an unwillingness to try new foods.

'When this happens social avoidance, anxiety and conflict can result.’

Pilot studies in America have found many thousands of people who seem to fit the criteria for the disorder. 

But SED should not be confused with normal childhood fussiness.

According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, about 12 per cent of three-year-olds suffer from persistent selective eating — extremely faddy about their food — but fewer than one per cent carry it into adulthood. 

She said: 'There is nothing worse than having a beautiful meal put down to you and going to take the first bite and thinking I can't put this in my mouth.

'No matter how much I want to eat it, I can't.

'I've always had major issues with meats. The fat on it is just sickening.

'On school days I wouldn't eat breakfast or lunch - instead, I'd live off a KitKat and a small part of my dinner at night, no breakfast or anything. 

Her mother added: 'Jennifer's eating habits really scare me. She seems to go through stages where she improves slightly but they never last very long.

'To be honest, her food phobia started at primary school, with her mainly avoiding red meat.

'But it has spiralled and can result in her eating virtually nothing in a day.

'I have let Jen make a shopping list and buy the foods she wants, but even this can fail.

'She will often come shopping with me and I let her get what she wants - but this mainly consists of junk food.

'I support Jen, as does the rest of the family, I attend doctor's appointments and dietitian appointments with her and will support her to overcome this disorder.'

Jennifer, who hopes to start university in September, is terrified her phobia of food will only get worse when she moves away from home.

But having been recently referred to a specialist by her GP, she is finally hoping to be diagnosed with SED so she can get the therapy she needs.

Support: Mrs Radigan said her daughter's eating habits terrify her. 'She seems to go through stages where she improves slightly, but they never last very long'

'I'm quite fearful about going to university, I've got used to eating around people I know but being around people I don't will be scary.

'I feel I will have to explain my situation in case I faint or don't eat in front of people.

'The foods I know I can't eat make me nervous as I know I need to eat them for the nutrients and that makes me upset.

'I can still get nervous when eating out but I've learned to brush it off. The only thing that scares me most is what could come from my eating or lack of eating.

'What if I fainted and no one was around to help me and I never woke up? 

I've worked hard myself to get to the stage that I'm at but I feel it slipping away as more foods are added to my "can't to eat list".

'Hopefully a proper diagnosis will help me get the therapy I need.'
