The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry attended a society wedding in Switzerland today.

The young Royals looked relaxed and happy as they watched the ceremony in the upmarket resort of Arosa.

They have been enjoying a mini-break at the resort as guests at the wedding of their polo-playing friend Mark Tomlinson to Olympic dressage gold medalist Laura Bechtolsheimer.

The trio all seemed to be enjoying the wedding as they chatted to guests. As the newly-married couple walked past them, an evidently delighted Kate threw a handful of confetti into the air.

The Duchess of Cambridge, who beamed as she watched the newlyweds emerging into the bright Swiss sunshine after the ceremony, was elegant in a cream woollen coat over a floral dress, teamed with a chocolate brown pillbox hat and fur scarf.

The Duchess had previously been pictured on the 
slopes of the resort.

Holding a wooden sledge and wearing sunglasses, the 31-year-old Duchess wore a brown snug jacket and warm looking boots. She was pictured next to a male friend looking relaxed and happy.

The chocolate-box Alpine resort is known for being small and compact, with stunning views of the surrounding mountains.

It is less well-known for its nightlife, being home to just a single 
long-established disco bar - which may come as a disappointment to 
party-loving Prince Harry.

With the world eagerly awaiting the arrival of the Royal baby, Kate has been getting plenty of opportunity to relax recently.

Last month, Prince William and Kate enjoyed a break in a sumptuous villa on one of the most exclusive paradise islands in the world.

The happy couple took a ‘babymoon’ break in a luxury £5 million house on Mustique.

Nestled amid lush tropical gardens, 
with dramatic views of the aquamarine Caribbean waters lapping a 
tranquil white-sand beach, the five-bedroom house would normally have 
cost about £19,000 a week to rent.

It was not known whether the 
multi-millionaire owners, who are close friends of both the Royal couple
 and the wider Middleton family, charged them for the stay.

The
 dream home was furnished with Oriental antiques and came with a staff 
of six servants, who oversee such amenities as a private cinema, gazebo 
and 64 ft infinity pool.

During the lavish trip, the Duchess was seen every day at the tennis courts on the privately owned island.

However, she was cheering from the sidelines rather than playing, as she has done on previous trips.

Arosa is known as being a small, smart resort with spectacular views of the surrounding mountains.

The town is situated just two hours south of Zurich in the Graubünden mountains. It is set high above the treeline in a natural bowl and is both a summer and winter tourist resort.Despite the Royal trio all being advanced skiers, the remote Swiss town is known for suiting skiers of all abilities. It boasts more than 37 miles of slopes. Prince Harry may have been disappointed to learn that the resort is not big for its nightlife, although it does contain one long-established disco bar.Two lakes are also situated in the centre of the resort.

‘They’re having a very quiet, peaceful holiday, which is just what Kate needed,’ a long-time island resident said.

‘I’d heard they were planning to 
leave on Thursday but that they are enjoying themselves so much, they 
may stay until after Valentine’s Day.’

The
 couple were joined by the Duchess’s sister Pippa, brother James and 
parents, Carole and Michael.

The Middletons rented accommodation nearby 
to give the couple some privacy.

Royal
 links to Mustique go back to 1960, when Princess Margaret was given a 
ten-acre estate there. The Queen and Prince Philip have also made 
several visits to the island.

An unprecedented veil of secrecy was drawn over William and Kate’s visit.

One American businesswoman, who is a regular visitor to the island, said: ‘The owners are an absolutely lovely pair and their villa is stunning.

‘It is perfect for William and Kate because it is luxurious and secluded. It is just what they need before the fervour of a newborn baby.

'I imagine they are on their guard after Kate was photographed topless in France, but there is no chance of that happening in Mustique.’

The expectant couple's trip to Mustique earlier this year was their seventh visit to the paradise island.

With its long stretches of white sand, palm trees and balmy temperatures, it is a world away from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's current location in a Swiss ski resort nestled in the snowy Graubünden mountains.

But with Kate snug in a cream woollen coat and a smart chocolate brown hat, and husband William decked out in tails, the pair looked more than happy to be in attendance at their friends' nuptials, in spite of the the brisk temperatures.

Focus of attention: Normally all eyes would be on the Duke and Duchess, but they were happy to stay in the background at their friends' wedding
