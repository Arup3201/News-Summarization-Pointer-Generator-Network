Married couples are happier than single people, especially those who say they married their best friend, says a new study. 

Married couples enjoyed both a honeymoon period of the first year or two after the wedding as well as being supported against stress from work pressure and looking after children or aging parents. 

The National Bureau of Economic Research in Canada used data for the report from the British Household Panel Survey, the United Kingdom's Annual Population, and the Gallup World Poll.

Married couples are happier than single people, especially those who say they married their best friend, says a new study.

'There's a lot of stress going on in middle age,' said Department of Finance Canada a researcher Shawn Grover in an interview with The Huffington Post. 'Having someone to talk that out with and having someone to support you in those difficult times can help explain why it's a bit harder for people without a partner.'

Those who saw their partner as their 'best friend' reported the highest happiness levels. 

Researches note that that fell in line with thinking that close relationships were necessary for long term well being.

Dr. Bella DePaulo said long-term platonic friendships can offer their own form of happiness and said such studies often don't take divorces into account. 

'Plus, the people who got married chose to marry,' DePaulo said about the new findings in an email to The Huffington Post. 'For people like me who are single at heart, getting married may not have the same implications as it does for the kinds of people who want to marry and choose to do so.' 

The findings use aggregated data meaning they don't necessarily apply to everyone but are a good guide of the average person's experience

Long-term partners who co-habitated were about as happy as the ones who were legally married.

'We do think it's more about that social relationship than the legal status,' Grover said. 'Marriage, in a sense, is a super friendship.'

The findings use aggregated data meaning they don't necessarily apply to everyone but are a good guide of the average person's experience.
