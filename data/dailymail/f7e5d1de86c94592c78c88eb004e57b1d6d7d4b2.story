The first pictures of a Spanish student who was decapitated in a frenzied attack have emerged, showing the young man smiling for the camera as he holds a glass of beer.

Sergio Retamar Marquez had told friends shortly before his brutal death that he was living in fear and was frightened by a person who would say 'very strange things' to him.

The 23-year-old English language student was hacked to death at his two-bedroom flat above a wine bar in Bournemouth, Dorset.

Mr Marquez's body was found after armed police swooped on the flat about 5pm on Tuesday.

Neighbours reported hearing screaming before the grim discovery.

Horrified friends who found his headless body were seen running out of the property screaming and looking gaunt.

A trail of blood was found leading away from an alleyway alongside the three-storey building.

A blood-covered man was arrested by police outside a private hospital a short distance away 30 minutes later.

Officers dressed him in a white forensic suit to preserve any evidence before he was driven to a police station.

Police taped off the building and officers with sniffer dogs were seen searching an area to the rear of the property, possibly looking for a murder weapon.

The dead man's uncle, Miguel Marquez Torres, flew to Britain on Wednesday to seek more information about his nephew's murder and begin the process of identifying and repatriating his body.

A post mortem examination revealed he died from multiple stab wounds to the chest.

Another relative of Mr Marquez, an only child, said: 'We have been told very little about what’s happened.

'It’s destroyed us, especially his mum who he was very close to.'

He moved to Britain last August to learn English and is believed to have started in a new job at a hotel shortly before his death.

He had briefly returned to his home town of Coin near Malaga to recover from a road accident and do a cookery course.

Jeanne Rimes, the deputy manager at the Savoy Hotel, Bournemouth, where Mr Marquez worked part time as a waiter, said: 'He was just a lovely boy.

'People who worked with him will be so distressed to know what happened.

'He was very popular with the guests, he was quite a quiet, shy guy but with the guests he was chatty and lovely all the time, always very polite.

'He was just genuine, reliable, trustworthy and a very helpful man.'

Police have arrested a 29-year-old Bournemouth man in connection with the killing. He has been detained at a secure mental health unit, while police have confirmed they are not looking for anybody else in connection with Mr Marquez's death.
