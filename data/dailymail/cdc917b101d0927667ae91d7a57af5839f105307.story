There was no time to wallow in a disappointing defeat to Real Sociedad for the Barcelona squad, as they visited sick children in eight separate hospitals on Monday afternoon.

Every year, Barcelona treat injured and sick children to a visit from their star players for the 'Dream for a Gift' campaign, created by the FC Barcelona Foundation.

Players including Neymar and Javier Mascherano were pictured signing autographs and posing with the kids, as management staff, directors and board members all got involved in cheering up the children.

Lionel Messi was not present, after missing training on Monday morning, while Rafinha was also absent with an ear infection. 

On Monday morning, the Barcelona players overcame their defeat at Anoeta Stadium by first taking part in an open training session at the Miniestadi, attended by 11,134 fans.

They then headed out across the city to bring 'a little sunshine and smiles' to the children at various hospitals and facilities, gifting them signed club merchandise and photographs with their heroes.

The celebrations took place on the day before 'King's Day', a national holiday in Spain, for which the players will be granted a day off.
