Francis Benali's incredible journey of 1,178,937 steps ended in emotional fashion at St Mary's.

And in fitting fashion, it was the Southampton faithful who cheered him on as he completed his 1,000 mile run.

In three weeks, the 45-year-old stopped off at all 20 Barclays Premier League grounds in his bid to raise money for Cancer Research.

'Every step has been worth it to come home. This is home,' Benali said at half-time during Southampton's 4-0 romp against Newcastle.

'The pain and discomfort I've experienced on this challenge has been quite often and quite difficult and tough, but I've had my wife and children and my support team have been absolutely increible. They've kept me going.

'The pain that I've experienced is nothing 9compared to) anyone goes through to see a loved one either suffering from cancer or dying from cancer, so I want to help try and help bring an end to cancer.

'Football has been my life but there is life after football. This has been an incredible experience. And I hope to spend some time and look back on it and reflect upon it one day. And I'm sure I'll look back on it with great affection.'

Matthew Le Tissier was among the former team-mates who welcomed Benali to St Mary's, with Lawrie McMenemy also in attendance.
