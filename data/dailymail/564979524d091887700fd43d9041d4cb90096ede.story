Rafael Nadal put his recent woes behind him as he eased to victory in his first-round match at the Australian Open on Monday.

Nadal's 2014 season had ended with defeat by 17-year-old Borna Coric in Basle and this year on tour began with a shock loss to world No 127 Michael Berrer in Doha.

But the Spanish world No 3 was in fine form in his opener at the first Grand Slam of the year in Melbourne as he took just one hour and 50 minutes to beat Mikhail Youzhny 6-3, 6-2, 6-2.

Nadal said: 'It was a very positive result for me. I think a very good start is very important.

'Always before the first match you always have the doubts, especially in the situation I'm arriving here. Every match is very important for me today. It was a comfortable victory that gives me some confidence.'

Nadal has never lost a set in the first round here in Melbourne and never on Monday did that run look like ending on the Rod Laver Arena.

Russian world No 49 Youzhny can be a wily opponent but the 32-year-old has struggled in recent times to match the level of consistency he once had when he was ranked as high as No 8 in the world.

Nadal hit a total of 37 winners throughout the match and sealed the win with a volley before showing his clear delight in celebration, pumping his first after picking up his first official victory of the year.

Nadal had cautiously downplayed his chances prior to the tournament but there is no doubt that he has the benefit of a kind draw from this point until a possible semi-final meeting with Roger Federer.

However, the 14-time Grand Slam champion still feels he needs to shake off the rust after only playing nine tour matches since July due to a wrist injury and appendix surgery.

Nadal said: 'You can practice a lot. I did. I practised I think enough and with the right attitude, but at the end what you need is matches. You practice very well, but you don't have matches under your shoulders.

'You cannot play with the right confidence, with the right competitive spirit, because you need to feel that. All the practices, you don't get that. The only way to get that is having matches.

'That's why this victory today is very important, and every time that I am on court competing is a big help for me to try to be back on the right level that I want to be.'

Next up for Nadal in the second round is American world No 112 Tim Smyczek, who beat Luke Saville 7-6 (7-2), 7-5, 6-4.
