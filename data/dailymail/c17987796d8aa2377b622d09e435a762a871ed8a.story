Nick Clegg and Danny Alexander were at the top of London’s Shard skyscraper. Oh no! Were they about to jump?

Happily it was nothing to do with an opinion poll suggesting both will lose their seats. Instead they had hurriedly called a Lib Dem PR event to try to scupper a big Cameron-Osborne event promoting the Tories’ ‘northern powerhouse’ idea.

The Shard venue was mad, delicious, screamingly vulgar: the 52nd-floor, Chinese-accented Gong Bar of the Shangri La hotel (minimum spend per head 30 quid).

Welcome to utopia and the ‘timeless allure of the Orient’, as the bar’s slogan goes.

It was a small, thick-carpeted boudoir lined by bottles of Champagne – Billecart-Salmon, Deutz, Egly-Ouriet. Aren’t they in the French three-quarter line?

Waiters shimmered in white, collarless uniforms, as favoured by dental nurses. We were greeted by wide-smiled beauties.

Lib Dem sportsman Lord Rennard would have been beside himself, had he only been there. Instead we had perhaps ten non-media attendees, not all Lib Dems. The suited gent’ next to me was witheringly rude about the party.

How had the Lib Dems paid for this chi-chi pad? Our host was a busy little puffball in a plum-coloured velvet jacket flourishing a top-pocket, silk hankie. His name was D.K. Matai and he was giving out business cards like after-dinner mints. He looked like Nick Nack in The Man With The Golden Gun.

Cleggy and decent Danny A (quite chunky these days) scuttled in and stood in the corner. Their backdrop should have been the glittering City but the view was of mist. A low cloud’s bright light cast the two MPs’ faces into shadow.

Mr Alexander opened proceedings. Clegg watched with a sullen air. Why so cheesed-off? Hand in pocket, a diagonal expression. Peevishness stewed in his eyes.

Channel 4’s Michael Crick asked Mr Clegg if he was going to lose his Sheffield seat. In a spurt of petulance Cleggy said the poll was ‘complete and utter nonsense’ got up by the trade unions. He had hoped Channel 4 might have asked about Lib Dem fiscal policies.

But what will be the point of manifesto pledges on tax/spending ratios if Cleggy and Danny are both decapitated by the electorate? What, indeed, is the point of any Lib Dem manifesto, seeing as it can only be a precursor to coalition talks? 

Mr Clegg was acidic about his Tory Coalition partners, accusing them of being cruel to the poor. The Labour party was derided rather less, though mocked for wanting to put bills on the ‘never-never’.

Mr Clegg (pictured) said his party’s ‘sensible, balanced approach would bring an end to the era of austerity in three years’ time while protecting public services and the most vulnerable in society

Cleggy four times described the Tories as ‘ideological’, as though this was undesirable in MPs. The opposite of an ideological politician, I suppose, is an opportunistic one? Is that preferable?

Cliches bubbled: ‘Economy back on track ... let us finish the job ... our plan ... fairness, etc.’ Mr Clegg claimed that the Lib Dems were the party of stability. Priceless! He mentioned the North and the South West of England, though not the South East (where Vince Cable has his seat). Venomous Vince’s name was mentioned at one point. Mr Clegg, hearing it, immediately started to shake his head.

And he took a swipe at the Tories ‘mismanaging their inner demons on Europe’. Ah yes, Europe. Is pro-Brussels Mr Clegg himself not a teensy bit ‘ideological’ on the EU?

A reporter asked if the Lib Dems and their higher tax policies had any supporters in the business world. Mr Clegg said they did: a chap called Richard who runs Innocent drinks. Any others? Cleggy said he would send the reporter ‘a postcard’ with further names of Lib Dem business backers. Not so many of them, then.

Not everything was audible, because a BBC TV reporter started doing a loud live broadcast in the room while Mr Clegg was talking. Velvet-jacketed Mr Matai told the reporter to be quiet. Well done, Nick Nack. Take a peerage.
