The man who accused Elmo puppeteer Kevin Clash of engaging in sex when he was underage has been identified as a 24-year-old wannabe model that was once arrested for allegedly robbing someone at knifepoint.

The accuser, Sheldon Stephens, of Pennsylvania, was named by The Smoking Gun website on Wednesday. The website said it learned the identity of Stephens from a family member and friend who were not named.

Stephens describes himself as an 'entrepreneur, student, model [and] actor' on his Twitter account. On his Facebook page, he writes, 'I like to consider myself a rare breed. I'm very spontaneous and random… I'm determined and goal oriented. My destiny is laid on a solid gold brick pathway... MY FUTURE IS BRIGHT and never will it dim.'

Named: Sheldon Stephens, 24 of Pennsylvania, has been identified as the man who accused Elmo Muppeteer Kevin Clash of engaging in sex when he was underage

Stephens had publicly accused Clash, the puppeteer behind Elmo on Sesame Street, of an underage 
sexual affair this week and then later recanted his claim.

The recantation comes one day after 
the accusations against Clash, who is openly gay, were published on TMZ,
setting off a firestorm in the media.

Andreozzi & Associates, a law 
firm that said it represented the accuser, said in a
statement on his behalf:

'He wants it to be known that his 
sexual relationship with Mr Clash was an adult consensual relationship.
He will have no further comment on the matter.'

Since the scandal broke, Clash, 52, 
has taken a leave of absence from the Sesame Workshop which produces the
popular children's TV show on PBS.

Court records show that Stephens has 
been arrested several times since 2009 on charges that include writing a
bad check and reckless driving.

His most serious charges were in 
September of 2009, when he was arrested at an airport in Pennsylvania 
after stepping off a flight from Los Angeles.He was charged in that arrest with robbing his former employer, Darian Pollard, at knifepoint.

Pollard accused Stephens of stealing a $250,000 'white gold necklace with diamonds' and a 'white gold ring with diamond baguettes' and then boarding a flight to Pennsylvania, according to a criminal complaint.

Stephens was wearing the jewelry when police arrested him and he insisted that the pieces were gifts. Charges filed against him in Pennsylvania were later dropped, however, and charges were never filed in California, The Smoking Gun reported.

After Stephens withdrew his allegations, Clash told the New York Times through a 
spokesman: 'I am relieved that this painful allegation has been put to 
rest. I will not discuss it further.'

Clash exchanged messages with his accuser in 2010 in which he apologized for constantly talking about sex and promised to make all of his 'dreams come true.'

The puppeteer, who has left the show 
in the wake of the accusations, told the man almost 30 years his junior 
that he loved him and offered to buy him a ticket to visit him in New 
York, it has emerged.

The Sesame Street stalwart, who has worked on the show since the mid-80s, admits to having a sexual 
relationship with the accuser but insists it only took place after the younger man was an adult.

Clash, 52, took a leave of 
absence from the children's show after the 23-year-old contacted the program's lawyers and told them he had a sexual 
relationship with the puppeteer seven years ago.

Allegations: Clash has left the popular children's show to fight the accusations

In the latest emails published by TMZ, sent well after the accuser turned 18, Clash wrote: 'I'm sorry that I keep talking about sex with you, its driving me insane.'

He added: 'I want you to know that I love
you and I will never hurt you. I'm here to protect you and make sure 
your dreams come true...

'I'll have my assistant book a ticket for you to come to NY and we can talk about this in person.'

Clash said the relationship was between two consenting adults and that he was deeply 
saddened that the younger man was 'trying to make it into something it was not.'

The 
accuser reportedly felt he was being silenced after his initial meeting with Sesame Street lawyers. He is now being represented by Andreozzi and Associates - the firm that worked with one of the victims
in the Jerry Sandusky child rape case.

In August, the accuser's lawyers wrote a
letter to Sesame Street accusing the program of trying to 'discredit 
the victim in order to protect its 
employee and the image of one of its most valuable characters.'

The letter also claimed the show's attitude 'places a greater value on a puppet than the well being of
a young man.'

Sesame Workshop officials, however, said they found the  the allegation of underage sex was 
unsubstantiated after a thorough 
investigation.

They say that rather than trying to hush up the accuser, they asked for evidence of his allegations, which was not received.

TMZ reported they had seen an email supposedly sent to the accuser by Clash, 
acknowledging they had the affair when he was 16, but officials believe it is fake as they say the
accuser never mentioned such an email existed.

Sesame Street disciplined Mr Clash 
for inappropriate use of company email after they found his messages to 
the accuser, but they reportedly did not indicate an illegal sexual 
relationship.

They said the divorced father of a 19-year-old girl had shown poor judgment, but claimed 
his leave of absence was to allow him to defend his reputation in the wake of the damaging allegations. 

Clash's ex-wife, Gina, declined to comment, but a friend who answered the door at her Baltimore home told the New York Daily News that the former nurse is 'surviving'.

A neighbor who did not wish to be identified defended Clash, saying: 'He was really good to her and the family. He's a really nice guy.'

Sesame Workshop insisted the scandal surrounding Clash does not mean the end of Elmo.

'Elmo is bigger than any one person,' the company said.

Clash has been Elmo's puppeteer for two decades, performing on the show as well as for PBS specials, DVD releases and TV movies, while earning nine Daytime Emmy Awards.

He eventually assumed the title of Sesame Street's Senior Puppet Coordinator and Muppet Captain, while also directing and producing show segments and TV specials.

He published an autobiography about his career in 2006 called My Life as a Furry Red Monster: What Being Elmo Has Taught Me About Life, Love and Laughing Out Loud.

Earlier this year he appeared in Being Elmo: A Puppeteer's Journey, a documentary detailing Clash's journey from a childhood obsession with puppets to assuming his role on the iconic show.
