There are a host of amazing things to see beneath the sea - as young photographer Bertie Gregory's stunning images prove.

Documenting life beneath the waves of the Red Sea, Bertie's images show the startling variety of life that can be found in the world's oceans.

Since graduating in Zoology from the University of Bristol in July, Bertie's 'day job' has been stalking big cats with renowned photographer Steve Winter.

However, when it came to taking a break he decided to indulge his passion for marine wildlife and signed onto a 'liveaboard' diving trip, which saw him spend a week onboard a boat far from land diving up to four times a day.

Bertie said: 'For me the best thing about underwater wildlife photography is the intimacy. In the majority of cases when I'm photographing on land the animals don't know I'm there. I'm hidden in a hide, shooting them from a distance with a long telephoto lens.

'Under the water I don't have the luxury of sitting in a hide and waiting for hours on end for an animal to turn up. Furthermore, the more water there is between me and my subject the less clear and colour rich the image. So to get great images I have to have close-up, in your face encounters with these weird and wonderful creatures.

'Some say that taking a camera down on a dive takes away from the experience. You're so engrossed in flash settings and shutter speeds that you miss things. I couldn't disagree more. 

'Because getting 'the shot' takes time and experimentation, on a typical dive I might spend time with just two or three subjects, rather than zooming round on a whistle-stop tour.

'Taking a camera down with me and spending a lot of time in one place enables me to spot things I might have otherwise missed.'

According to Bertie a classic example of this happened while he was following a lionfish and suddenly spotted a tiny fish poking its head out of a host anemone.

He added: 'I had the wrong lens on to really get the best out of the opportunity, but even so I put my little finger in the shot to give a sense of scale. It was only after 2 or 3 shots that I then noticed the equally tiny eel, posing in its hole just to the left of the anemone'.

Meanwhile, his decision to hang around and watch a stationary octopus paid off when it began to hunt.

'My patience paid off as it soon began to hunt: instead of swimming, it crawled across the coral purposefully using its eight muscular tentacles. 

'Fish were fleeing in all directions but some foolishly chose not to run but instead, hide in little crevices. The octopus then stabbed its tentacles into every escape hole in the rock before expanding the membrane between its arms forming a huge balloon. 

'Once cornered like this, the fish's fate was sealed, quite literally, sucked into the octopus' beak in the centre of its arms.'
