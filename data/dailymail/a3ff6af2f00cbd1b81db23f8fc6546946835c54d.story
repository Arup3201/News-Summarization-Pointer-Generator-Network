Scandal creator Shonda Rhimes has a policy of not having real-life political figures make guest appearances on her Washington, D.C. based political thriller. But the powerhouse producer told E! News last week that she would be willing to make an exception for philandering president Bill Clinton.

'That's not really our thing, but I will say, "Bill Clinton, if you're out there, we would love to have you…We would always love to have you," 'she said.

Casting Call: Scandal creator Shonda Rhimes says she'd love to have former President Bill Clinton make a cameo on the show

Like Scandal's fictitious President, Fitzgerald Grant, played by Tony Goldwyn, Bill Clinton was publicly shamed during his presidency for knocking boots with a White House staffer.

After infamously claiming he never had sexual relations with White House intern Monica Lewinsky in January of 1998, Clinton, who was then in the second year of his second term, admitted in an August 1998 televeised address that he did in fact have an improper sexual relationship with Lewinsky.

Rhimes' twisted political drama, which is gearing up for its fourth season, is not a dramatization of Clinton's time in office, however.

Grant is a Republican, and the show is very loosely based on the administration of Republican President George H.W. Bush, who held office for one term from 1988 - 1992.

The character played by actress Kerry Washington, former White House communications aide and presidential mistress Olivia Pope, was inspired by former Bush administration aide Judy Smith, who now runs a high-end crisis communications shop in Washington, D.C.

Smith also serves as a co-producer on Scandal.

of Olivia Pope on Scandal

At a Scandal-themed Politico Playbook breakfast held in concert with the White House Correspondents dinner in early May, Bush's former Transportation Secretary, Andrew Card, said that Smith called up her former boss to forewarn him about the racy content of the show and he teased her about the on-air affair and said he was 'honored' to be the inspiration for Scandal's hunky president.

President Bush and Smith were not romantically involved like their on air counterparts but the sex-filled side plot between Pope and the POTUS in Scandal makes for a juicer storyline.

Neither the Bush administration nor the Clinton administration made a habit of killing anyone who stood it its way, either, a common remedy for political problems that arise in Scandal.

'There are always interesting politicians out there who would be interesting [to have on the show], but our show is a very heightened, very dark view of Washington,' Rhimes told E! News. 'I don't think really Bill Clinton or any of those people belong in our Washington.'

Not everything that occurs in Scandal is completely out of the realm of possibility, however.

When the press learns of the president's affair with Pope, paparazzi show up at the fixer's door and bombard her with questions about her intimate relationship with the Commander in Chief.

Lewinsky was pestered by the press in a similar manner after she was outed as Clinton's former mistress.

Ironically, it was Judy Smith who represented Monica Lewinsky during Clinton's impeachment proceedings, which would make an on-set rendezvous between the former president and Smith all the more titillating.

It's unlikely that Clinton would want to draw new attention to his sex life by appearing on the show, but much stranger things have happened in politics. 

The former president hasn't made any cameos in the past, however, Clinton is known to be a fan of the show and may fancy an opportunity to meet the cast and crew.

Both the president in Scandal and Clinton engaged in sexual misconduct while in office, but Scandal is not based on Clinton's presidency
