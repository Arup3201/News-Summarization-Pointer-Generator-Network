Robin van Persie is confident Nigel de Jong will play for Holland before the World Cup ends, despite the Dutch side announcing the midfielder's groin injury could rule him out for 'two to four weeks'.

De Jong was forced off nine minutes into the Oranje's last-16 win over Mexico, and with it saw his tournament all but come to an end.

Van Persie, though, thinks differently: ‘The miracles are not out yet. I’ve talked to him about it and he’s going for it, even if it is for only one game.'

The Holland and Manchester United striker, with three goals in Brazil so far, acknowledges it won't be against Costa Rica, though.

It means Louis van Gaal would have to orchestrate a win on Saturday, should De Jong make his World Cup return in a later game.

‘I have known Nigel for over 20 years and he is a fighter,' added Van Persie, as reported by VI.

‘At Costa Rica we are really going to miss him. You could see against Mexico, even though Daley Blind did well.

‘It’s great that Nigel stays with the group.

'Even off the field he makes with his energy a difference for young and old. He always exudes: “We are going to devour everyone.” Nigel would be the final pick.'

And Van Persie knows it will be tough to replace De Jong for Saturday's showdown with Costa Rica.

'It is primarily terrible for Nigel himself,' said Van Persie. 'He was working on an unprecedented World Cup.

'I know that scanning is only one scan, then we will see an injury sometimes is very much not always the same in practice.

‘He is our tower of strength. I hope and we hope all together, he’s still going to make World Cup minutes. Nigel is a fighter, the miracles are not out yet.'

The KNVB, though, were more pragmatic in a statement: 'An MRI examination at hospital confirmed that Nigel de Jong is struggling with a tear in his groin muscle.

'The 75-times capped international is therefore presumably out for two to four weeks.

'De Jong, who in last Sunday’s match against Mexico was injured after nine minutes, remains with the team in Brazil to work there on his rehabilitation.'
