St Helens scrum-half Luke Walsh's comeback has been further delayed due to complications following ankle surgery, coach Keiron Cunningham has revealed.

The former Penrith Panthers player has not played since breaking his leg last July and during his lay-off he had an operation to correct a previous injury with his ankle.

It was hoped the goalkicking half-back would be fit for the start of the Super League season in February but a virus set him back and now he is facing another month on the sidelines.

'He had complications with his ankle before he did his leg and we got that sorted out after his leg had healed,' Cunningham said.

'There have been a few complications with the bits and bobs (screws and plates) inside his leg so they have been removed.

'It was the right thing to do for Luke. It feels like a normal leg to him now - no screws or plates in the bones. He is in a good place now and hopefully will be back around the start to the second week of April.'

The unbeaten champions' next match is against Warrington at Langtree Park on Thursday
