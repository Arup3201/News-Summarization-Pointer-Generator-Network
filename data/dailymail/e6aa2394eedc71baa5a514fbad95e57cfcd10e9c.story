Weighing little more than a bag of sugar,  twins Matthew and James were born 17 weeks premature.

Fitting in the palm of their mothers' hand, the tiny brothers faced an uphill battle to survive.

At 26 hours old, James tragically lost his fight, leaving parents Natalie and Adrian O'Hara devastated.

But their grief was compounded when doctors warned their surviving son, Matthew, had just a one in five chance of living.

But today, after months of treatment, Matthew is home with his parents.

Mrs O'Hara, 34, from Walton, Liverpool, said: 'It was a huge shock to see how small Matthew was when he was born - I could fit him on the palm of my hand.

'Changing his nappies was terrifying - he was so small I kept thinking I was going to break him.

'When James died we really feared the worst for Matthew - we never thought he was going to pull through.

'We were both very numb after losing James and Matthew looked so fragile from the moment he was born.

'Doctors were telling us different things on an hourly basis - his condition could change very quickly.

'He was put straight on a ventilator when he was born because he needed help with his breathing and his lungs needed to be stabilised.

'But hours and days ticked by and Matthew eventually started to grow.

'He's still very small but he's absolutely amazing - he's doing all of the things he should be at his age.'

The twins were born at Liverpool Women's Hospital on February 15 this year - with Matthew weighing a tiny 1lb 5oz. 

His brother James was so underdeveloped he lost the fight for his life a day later.

Matthew, who is now nine months old, could only breathe using a ventilator and a tube because his lungs were underdeveloped. 

He also struggled to get oxygen to his vital organs due to a crippling heart condition.

But Matthew, who now weighs a much healthier 11lbs 5oz, was finally allowed to leave hospital for the first time after five months and a day, of intense care.

After five months of care at Alder Hey Children's Hospital, baby Matthew was finally allowed home 

His twin brother, James, was too tiny and underdeveloped to survive, passing away just 26 hours after the brothers were born on February 15

Mrs O'Hara said: 'Matthew has kidney stones and very poor eye-sight but everyone is completely shocked that's he's made it as far as he has. He spent five months and a day in hospital and still goes back to Alder Hey Children's Hospital for check-ups but it's a miracle that he's done so well'

His remarkable journey is set to be aired on Channel 5's show Miracle Babies tomorrow night.  

Mrs O'Hara, a research scientist at the University of Liverpool, said: 'Matthew has kidney stones and very poor eye-sight but everyone is completely shocked that's he's made it as far as he has.

'He spent five months and a day in hospital and still goes back to Alder Hey Children's Hospital for check-ups but it's a miracle that he's done so well.

'They've been filming Matthew for the programme since he was two weeks old.

'I didn't want to do it at first because of what had happened with James but Adrian really wanted to do it.

'Looking back now I'm so glad we chose to do it - it's brilliant for people to get to see the amazing work the hospitals do.

'It'll be great to show the programme to Matthew when he's older so he can understand just how incredible his journey has been.'

A spokesman for Liverpool Women's Hospital said: 'Only one in five babies who are born 17 weeks premature would usually survive because they're so underdeveloped.

'Babies are very fragile so we have to take extra care - especially with premature births.

'But we're constantly developing ways to help these babies and give them the best chance in life.'
