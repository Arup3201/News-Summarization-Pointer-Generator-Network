Killer: Adam Lanza may have been copying a video game when he opened fire on students and teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary School

Police investigating the Newtown school killings have been looking into the possibility that gunman Adam Lanza may have been copying a video game as killed 26 people in the massacre.

Two months after the horror at Sandy Hook Elementary School, little remains known about Lanza's motive.

Before the killings, he had smashed his hard drive, making his online trail and habits impossible to follow, but police did reportedly find thousands of dollars worth of violent video games.

It is believed that Lanza played the games, which included the Call of Duty series, for hours on end.

Along with the video games, Adam Lanza also learned how to fire guns during numerous sessions with his mother Nancy Lanza at a shooting range, where the two 'bonded.'

The Hartford Courant reported today that detectives are probing whether Lanza may have been copying a scenario from one of those video games as he fired rounds from his mother's Bushmaster assault rifle in two classrooms at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14.

Her landscaper Dan Holmes told the paper: 'She said she took her kids target shooting, that they bonded over that.'

Lanza, who was 20 years old, is the face
 behind the ruthless murder of 20 first-graders, six adults and his own 
mother that shook the quiet Connecticut town.

He then turned one of his weapons on himself as police closed in.

Nancy Lanza was Adam's first victim on the morning of the Newtown killings, shot dead in her bed at extremely close range, possibly while she was asleep.

Before that, she was seen as a dedicated mother to Adam, who had been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome and a sensory integration disorder (an aversion to bright lights and loud noises), according to the Courant.

She had enrolled and pulled Adam into 
numerous schools over the years after growing unsatisfied with the 
education he was receiving.

She was planning a move to Washington state with the hopes of getting her son back into a college program.

But Adam Lanza also received an education on weapons from his mother, who took him target shooting at a gun range for years.

Richard Novia, a security chief in the Newtown School system who moderated the tech club - of which Adam had been a member - said he disagreed with Nancy Lanza's recreation with her son.

He told the Courant: 'It's a serious mistake, first of all. If you have a child in the home with mental disorders, or learning disabilities, to have involved him with guns in the first place would be bad.'

Days after the Sandy Hook shooting, Nancy Lanza's sister-in-law Marsha revealed that she had traveled to nine cities in three countries because she wanted out of the mansion she shared with her troubled son Adam - and could have known the end was coming.

It is believed that Nancy - who was 
suffering from multiple sclerosis - wanted to downsize and find a place 
for him to go to college as she was tired of home schooling the troubled
 20-year-old.

Nancy, who herself had been diagnosed 
with MS, supposedly had a 'charmed upbringing' in Kingston, New 
Hampshire, where her mother was the school nurse.

She married her high school 
sweetheart Peter Lanza and they moved to Newtown, Connecticut, in 1999 
where they moved into a $1.5million Colonial property.

Ten years later however they divorced - but Nancy’s troubles were only just beginning.

Speaking
 to MailOnline Marsha Lanza, from Crystal Lake, Illinois, said: ‘Nancy 
opened up with me and told me she had been diagnosed with MS. 

‘This was a few years ago but I don't think many of the family knew. She wasn't someone to make a fuss. She accepted life as it was.

In a Facebook conversation seen by MailOnline, Nancy also gave the most revealing account of her own family problems and how they may have shaped her life

‘Over the last year she suddenly seemed to be traveling a lot. I know she went to England and was all over the US.

‘There
 was no sign her health was getting worse. She still looked beautiful, 
so full of life, but maybe she felt time was running out.’

The Facebook conversation seems to 
back this up. On October 9, Nancy wrote to Marsha that she had been to 
‘a little bit of everywhere.'

Peter made $445,000 a year and agreed to pay $240,000 a year in alimony and child support, according to court records

She
 wrote: ‘Boston, New York, Maine, Toronto, London, San Francisco, 
Nantucket, Charlotte, Baltimore...that covers this year : )’

Nancy also talked about wanting to move to a smaller house but did not want to sell her home at a loss.

When she married her high school 
sweetheart Peter Lanza in 1981, the couple built a house next door to the home where
 they lived until they moved to Newtown.

She moved to Newtown with her husband
 Peter in 1998.

He would commute to the city for his job at General Electric.

The
 couple divorced in 2009 after their marriage 'irretrievably broke 
down'.

Peter made $445,000 a year and agreed to pay $240,000 a year in 
alimony and child support, according to court records.

This was likely due to the cost of Adam's care.

Adam Lanza, 20, had lived his whole 
life at the $1.4million home in Newtown where he killed his mother while
 she lay in bed in her pajamas.

Nancy Lanza was described as a 'gun enthusiast' who taught Adam, who had autism-related Asperger's Syndrome, how to shoot.

The four weapons, including a Glock 
10-mm handgun, a Sig Sauer 9-mm handgun and a Bushmaster AR-15 assault 
rifle, used in the mass shooting at the elementary school all belonged 
to Nancy Lanza.
