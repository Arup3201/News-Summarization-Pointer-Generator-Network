She has lived through two world wars, 70 governments and her life spans three centuries.

Now, Europe's oldest woman has revealed the secrets of her long life. 

Emma Morano, from Verbania, Italy,  has been alive for over 115 years - and claims eating raw eggs and avoiding men has kept her young.

Ms Morano is not only the oldest person in Europe, but the fifth oldest person in the world. 

Emma Morano, 115, says eating three raw eggs a day and avoiding relationships with men are the key to her long life. She separated from her husband in 1938 and never married again

When asked about her longevity, she simply said: '115 years are a lot'.  

Although she was married at one point,  it was an unhappy union, and ended in 1938 after the death of her young child.

Since then, she has had many suitors but has resisted all their advances, the New York Times reports.

'I didn't want to be dominated by anyone,' she said.

Separation at that time was rare, and divorce only became legal in Italy in 1970.

Ms Morano also credits her longevity on her love of raw eggs.

She has also been eating three a day since she was a teenager, after a doctor said this would counter her anaemia.

Her niece, her main carer, brings the eggs – along with the rest of the day's meals – to her every morning.

The Gerontology Research Group has confirmed the ages of more than 70 living supercentenarians —  those who are 110 and older.

Nearly all are women, and most are located in North America, Europe and Japan, where proof-of-age records are more readily available.

Here are the 10 oldest people in the world whose ages have been validated by the group:

1. Misao Okawa, 116, Japan

2. Gertrude Weaver, 116, United States

3. Jeralean Talley, 115, United States

4. Susannah Mushatt Jones, who turns 115 on Sunday, United States

5. Bernice Madigan, 114, United States

6. Emma Morano-Martinuzzi, 114, Italy

7. Antonia Gerena Rivera, 114, United States

8. Ethel Lang, 114, England

9. Nabi Tajima, 113, Japan

10. Blanche Cobb, 113, United States 

Her life has straddled three centuries, and she has watched Italy evolve from a monarchy to a republic.

She was born on November 29, 1899, in Civiasco, a town in Piedmont, northwest of Italy and bordering Switzerland and France.

She moved to Verbenia , a town on the shore of Lake Maggiore, as a young woman, where she got a job in a factory making jute sacks, which are usually used to hold potatoes.

She has been there ever since. 

She was one of eight children, and living well into old age runs in the family; one of her sisters died just short of 100, while another lived to 102.

She became famous when she turned 110, joining the ranks of the 75 living supercentarians – who are nearly all female.

Doctors and researchers travel to her bedside to study her genetics and lifestyle.

In general, researchers studying ageing have found different 20 to 30 per cent of a person's lifespan is related to genetics, the rest is down to lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise.

A 2012 study published in PLoS Medicine found even small amounts of exercise can extend life expectancy by up to 4.5 years.

Older research studying the world's 'blue zones', where people commonly live past more than 100 years, theorised that not smoking, eating a plant-based diet, eating vegetables and nuts, regularly exercising and having a healthy social and family life are the key behaviours related to living longer.

Feeling youthful could also help delay old age.

A recent British study found people who feel three or more years younger than their chronological age have a lower death rate compared with those who felt their age or who felt more than one year older than their age.

Older-feeling adults were about 40 per cent more likely to die than younger-feeling adults.

Ms Morano also credits her longevity on her love of raw eggs. She has been eating three a day since she was a teenager, after a doctor said this would counter her anaemia
