Escaped: Antonio M. Brown Sr., pictured, escaped from a holding cell at the Saline County Jail at around 4.17 p.m. on Monday

A Kansas man convicted of murdering his girlfriend's young son has escaped from jail the day before he was expected to be sentenced to life in prison.

Antonio M. Brown Sr. got himself free from a holding cell at the Saline County Jail at around 4.17 p.m. yesterday.

Police were hunting for the 29-year-old killer who they described as 'extremely dangerous' late into the night using trained dogs and a Kansas Highway Patrol airplane but have failed to locate him.

Brown pleaded no contest in January to first-degree murder and child abuse in the November 2011 death of 14-month-old Clayden Urbanek.

The toddler died in hospital of tears to his intestines after Brown punched him two or three times in the stomach over a two-week period while he was in his care.

Clayden's mother, Brittney N. Betzold, who watched as her child suffered increasingly serious bruises on his face and body, was sentenced last month to 13 years in prison for the little boy's tragic death.

Brown had been held in the Mitchell County jail in Beloit but was brought back to Salina yesterday to prepare for sentencing, Sheriff Glen Kochanowski said.

He was due to appear in Saline County District Court at 1:30 p.m today.

Kochanowski said Brown was placed in a cell in his department's booking area and somehow got out.

'We just brought him back to get him ready for (court) tomorrow,' Kockanowski told Salina.com yesterday. 'He was detained in one of the cell block rooms in the booking area and he got out of one of the doors.'

Kochanowski told the news outlet that Brown's daring escape was captured 'on film.' But the footage has not been released.

'They're still working on (how Brown escaped),' Kochanowski said. 'This guy is extremely dangerous.'

Brown is white, with brown hair and brown eyes. He's 5-foot-11 and was last seen wearing a white T-shirt and gray jail pants.

Dogs: Officers used trained dogs, pictured, and a Kansas Highway Patrol airplane but have failed to locate him

Clayden's death was described by a Witchita doctor as the worst case of child abuse he'd ever seen, Salina.com reported.

Brown, who was Betzold's live-in 
boyfriend and not the child's father, was caring for the boy while his 
21-year-old mother was at work.

On
October 4, Brown called her home from work because Clayden was 'not 
acting right' and she arrived to find him weak and motionless.

When he died later at hospital he was covered in bruises including inch deep marks on his buttocks, doctors testified.

The Salina Police Department, Saline County Sheriff's Office, Kansas Highway Patrol, Kansas Bureau of Investigation, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation were all actively searching for Brown on Monday and into today.

Officers were knocking on doors and searching houses, railroad beds, creeks and other locations across Salina.
