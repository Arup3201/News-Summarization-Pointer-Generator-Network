A professional football player has become the latest person to reveal far too much on social media after a video of his penis was uploaded to his Instagram.

DeAndre Hopkins, a 21-year-old wide receiver for the Houston Texans, claims that his account was hacked and that is how the explicit video ended up being sent to his followers.

His girlfriend posted on his verified Twitter account explaining the situation on Wednesday morning.

Didn't catch this one: DeAndre Hopkins, 21, claims his Instagram account was hacked on Wednesday

Explicit: The video showed Hopkins holding his penis but only a still remains after certain websites took a screen grab of the image

'Instagram was hacked, this is his girlfriend he's in meetings with no phone, have some respect ppl,' the post read.

A screengrab of the video was taken by Deadspin.

Black Sports Online reports that the video showed Hopkins masturbating, but it has since been deleted in its entirety and the still is all that remains.

He posted an inspirational quote on his Twitter account hours later: 'No weapon formed against me shall prosper.'

He is not the first football player to accidentally post a picture of his genitals on the internet- whether he himself did it or it was the work of hackers.

Redskins player Chris Cooley came under fire in 2008 for posting a picture of the team playbook while studying for a pre-game quiz. The problem there, aside from revealing the team's plays, was that he chose to study in the nude and his penis was visible in the photo.

Hopkins, whose nickname is 'Nuk', was drafted by the Texans this year after playing at Clemson University in South Carolina for two years.

This is not his first public relations issue since leaving college, however.

The Big Lead reports that in February, in the time ramping up to the draft, Hopkins was accused of staying in a hotel room that was 'trashed', with urine and feces.

Hopkins, who was staying in the room at The Crowne Plaza hotel in Indianapolis with fellow recruit Mark Harrison, denied his involvement in the incident.

He told Fox Sports that the room was in good condition when he checked out of it.

'Luckily, thank god, my agent got my flight booked early or it really would’ve been questionable if I did (it) or not,' Hopkins said.

'I got done before Mark Harrison, so I was already packed. I already took a shower and packed and everything. Mark came in and we spoke for at least 20 minutes about the Combine. Then the bellman came in and helped me get my bags out. And I left. That’s honestly all I can say.'
