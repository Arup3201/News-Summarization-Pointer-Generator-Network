Justin DeRyke pleaded guilty to the murder of Willow Long, his 7-year-old niece, after initially telling police that he had 'put her out of her misery' after she fell and pierced her neck

A southern Illinois man pleaded guilty on Tuesday to the first-degree murder of his seven-year-old niece.

In September 2013, Justin DeRyke was accused of killing Willow Long near her home in Watson, about 100 miles northeast of St Louis.

He claimed that she had fallen and pierced her neck on a brush stick so he cut her throat and then stabbed her in the heart to ‘put her out of her misery’.

DeRyke was babysitting Willow and her 3-year-old brother while the children’s mother was in a bar and their grandparents at work.

The 22-year-old caretaker said that he had spent the evening playing video games until 10.30pm when he went to his room to watch a porn video.

Half an hour later, Willow went up to him and grabbed his hand to persuade him to watch a film.

As she did so, she accidentally scratched him and he lost his temper.

He yelled at her, he claimed, and she ran out of the house slipping and falling onto a pile of sharp brush sticks, one of which stabbed her in the neck.

DeRyke told police that the girl was twitching and he did not want her to suffer, so he grabbed a knife from his room, slit the child’s throat and then stabbed her in the heart about five times to 'put her out of her misery'.

According to court documents, DeRyke wrapped Willow’s body in several plastic bags secured with duct tape, and then disposed of her in the countryside south of Watson.

Ciara DeRyke reported her daughter missing on the Sunday and around 1,000 volunteers searched for her, finding the remains the next day.

Justin DeRyke went to work instead of helping with the search, raising police suspicions.

A post-mortem examination showed that besides the injuries to her throat, collarbone and chest, Willow also suffered defensive wounds to her hands, suggesting that she had fought for her life.

Judge Kimberly Koester accepted DeRyke's guilty plea. As part of the plea deal, other charges against DeRyke were dismissed.

‘Justin DeRyke's plea of guilty to the offence of first-degree murder means that society will be protected and the murderer will spend the rest of his life behind bars,’ said Effingham County State's Attorney Bryan M. Kibler.

‘The sentence in this case is the maximum allowed by law. Justin DeRyke will never again pose a threat to any child.’

Ciara DeRyke was charged with obstruction for lying to police investigating the girl's disappearance.

She told them she had seen her daughter when the girl was already dead.

She pleaded guilty in January and was sentenced to 120 days’ jail. She also received 18 months’ probation.

The Illinois Department of Children and Family Service have taken Willow’s 3-year-old brother into protective custody.
