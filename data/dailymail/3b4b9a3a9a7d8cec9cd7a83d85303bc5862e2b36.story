The shocking moment a Florida painter smashed a $1 million vase by famed Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei has been caught on camera.

A visitor to the Perez Art Museum Miami filmed in horror on Sunday as Maximo Caminero lifted one of the colorfully painted vases and let it smash to the ground.

The sound of the ceramic sculpture breaking into several pieces as it hit the floor, reverberated around the gallery as Caminero stood with his arms by his sides.

Destroyed: Maximo Caminero is seen holding up the $1 million vase

The 51-year-old is facing up to five years in prison after being charged with criminal mischief for vandalizing the Colored Vases installation.

The vase was part of a 2008 piece being shown as a 20-year retrospective of Ai's work, which is often created from modified 'found' objects.

In the now damaged work being shown in Miami, the artist had claimed to use vases from China's Neolithic period, which he then coated with industrial paint.

The cellphone footage, broadcast by WSB-TV, shows Caminero smashing the piece while standing next to a series of photos that show Ai breaking one of the vases, believed to have been 5,000 to 7,000 years old.

Caminero claimed to be an admirer of Ai and interpreted the pictures as a way to join his fellow artist in protest.

'I
 was at PAMM and saw Ai Weiwei's photos behind the vases where he drops 
an ancient Chinese vase and breaks it. And I saw it as a provocation by 
Weiwei to join him in an act of performance protest,' he said.

According to the arrest affidavit, a security guard had ordered Caminero to put the ancient vase down.

Instead, Caminero smashed the vase on the
 floor and 'spontaneously told [police] that he broke the vase in 
protest of local artists and that the museum only displayed 
international artists'.

Caminero, who claimed to have been an 
artist for 30 years, said he was frustrated that local artists like 
himself aren't showcased in Miami-area art museums.

'I did it for all the local artists in Miami that have never been shown in museums here,' Caminero told the Miami New Times.
 'They have spent so many millions now on international artists.'

The
 police affidavit listed the value of the vase as $1 million, but 
Caminero said he had no idea it was that valuable.

'If you saw the vases on display and the 
way they were painted there was no way one would think the artist had 
painted over an ancient artifact,' Caminero said.

'Instead I thought it 
was a common clay pot like you would find at Home Depot, frankly.'

An official appraisal of the vase’s value is being carried out, according to a spokeswoman for the museum.

Ai told the New York Times he originally believed the vase had been broken by accident, but later discovered it had been done deliberately.

'[Caminero's] argument doesn’t make much sense. If he really had a point, he should choose another way, because this will bring him trouble to destroy property that does not belong to him,' he said.

A statement from the museum said it was working with police investigating the damage.

'This destructive act is vandalism and disrespectful to another artist and his work, to Pérez Art Museum Miami, and to our community,' the statement added.

Frustrated: Caminero was protesting a lack of gallery space for local artists

Ai is arguably China's 
most famous artist, and probably best known for having designed the 
Bird's Nest Olympic stadium in Beijing for the 2008 Olympics.

The sculptor, designer and documentary-maker has used his art and international profile to draw attention to injustices in China and the need for greater transparency and rule of law.

Caminero had a recent showing at the JF Gallery in West Palm Beach that offered a patrons a chance to meet him and 'view a sampling of the work from his 30-year career as an artist.'
