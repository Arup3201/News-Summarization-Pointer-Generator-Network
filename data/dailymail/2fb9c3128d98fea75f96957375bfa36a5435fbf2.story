Former Chicago Bears general manager Jerry Angelo said NFL teams didn't discipline players in 'hundreds and hundreds' of domestic violence incidents during his 30-year career.

'I made a mistake,' Angelo told USA Today. 'I was human. I was part of it. I'm not proud of it.'

Angelo was the Bears' general manager from 2001 to 2011.

Former Chicago Bears general manager Jerry Angelo says he 'made a mistake' in being part of sweeping under the rug 'hundreds and hundreds' cases of domestic violence incidents during his 30 years in the NFL

He entered the league as a scout with Dallas in 1980, worked as a scout for the New York Giants from 1982 to 1986, and was Tampa Bay's director of player personnel for Tampa Bay from 1987 to 2001.

'We knew it was wrong,' said Angelo. 

'For whatever reason, it just kind of got glossed over. I'm no psychiatrist, so I can't really get into what that part of it is.

'I'm just telling you how I was. I've got to look at myself first. And I was part of that, but I didn't stand alone.'

The Bears on Thursday denied any knowledge of Angelo's claims.

'We were surprised by Jerry's comments and do not know what he is referring to,' the team said in the statement to USA Today.

Angelo added to the newspaper: 'Short of killing somebody, there is absolutely nothing worse than abusing a child or a woman. Nothing. And I think everybody understands that now much, much better.

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell on Wednesday met with the full body of team owners to discuss domestic violence and discipline for misbehavior

'We'll be better for it. Everybody will be better. The players, the NFL, everybody.'

On Wednesday, Commissioner Roger Goodell met with the full body of NFL owners for the first time since several missteps by the league involving personal conduct incidents.

The agenda was filled with discussion of domestic violence and discipline for misbehavior.

'Our business is to win games,' Angelo said.

'We've got to win games, and the commissioner's job is to make sure the credibility of the National Football League is held in the highest esteem. But to start with that, you have to know who's representing the shield.

'We got our priorities a little out of order.'

Two recent incidents have sparked a national debate about how domestic violence involving football players should be punished within the league.

Vikings running back Adrian Peterson is facing child abuse charges for allegedly whipping his toddler son with a switch.

And ex-Ravens running back Ray Rice has been released from the team after video surfaced showing him knocking out his then-fiancee with a punch.
