Shelia Jones, headteacher at St Joseph's Roman Catholic primary school, is accused of forcing children to lie on the floor while she 'calls God'

A headteacher of a Catholic primary school is accused of punishing pupils by forcing them to lie on the floor in a prayer room while she pretended to ring God to say they had been naughty.

Shelia Jones, who is in charge of more than 200 pupils at St Joseph's Roman Catholic primary school in Devizes, Wiltshire, allegedly humiliated the children on more than one occasion, it is claimed.

Angry parents have written to the school's governors and complained to the education watchdog Ofsted after the revelations came to light.

Tammy Brimble claims her 11-year-old son Cyrus was among three other boys threatened by Mrs Jones with a 'phone call to God' and is calling for her to resign.

She said: 'I didn't find out about it will we got home. Cyrus was very quiet and I could tell something was bothering him.

'When he told me what had happened to him and three other boys, I was upset but I wanted to find out why she did it.

'I don't think what she did was appropriate at all. We are not Roman Catholics but it was still distressing for my child for her to call on God like that.'

Mrs Brimble made several attempts to speak to the headteacher and eventually wrote a letter of complaint to the school governors and Ofsted.

She said in a letter to Simon Napper, deputy chairman of the governors: 'Cyrus has been subjected to the humiliation of being punished by Sheila on more than one occasion by having to lie face down on the floor.

'We have witnesses for this too, and the evidence of the harm this has caused him.'

Another parent, Alexandra Jones, who used to work as a lunchtime supervisor, has also complained to Ofsted.

She said: 'All the children were whispering about something and then it came out that Sheila had made some of them lie face down in the prayer room while she pretended to ring God on her mobile phone.'

Ofsted has asked Wiltshire Council's safeguarding panel to investigate the parents' complaints.

In a letter to another parent who cited 'problems' at the school, Ofsted replied: 'The information provided raised concerns about the safety of children.

'Ofsted has shared your concerns with the local authority so they can progress these safeguarding concerns as they consider appropriate.'

The school, which was rated as 'needing improvements' at its last Ofsted review in February 2013, is due to receive inspectors for a fresh assessment within a few days.

The education watchdog said it was not willing to comment further.

Colette Culligan, chairman of the governors, said: 'We are aware of an allegation against one of the teaching staff.

'In order to follow due process, all inquiries regarding this issue need to be directed to Wiltshire Council.

The school, founded in 1864 (pictured), is said to be aware of the allegation and the issue has been directed to Wiltshire Council. The local authority says it will need to receive a letter from Ofsted before investigating

'This is to ensure that any investigation currently being conducted is not unduly influenced.'

A Wiltshire Council spokesman said: 'Once we have received the letter from Ofsted we will look into any concerns raised.'

On the school's website, Mrs Jones claims in her welcome message that the faith school is 'built on gospel values of love, tolerance, forgiveness and compassion'. 

She adds: 'We aim to be a loving community which is inspired by the life and teaching of Jesus Christ.'

The school was founded in 1864 when a group of sisters opened a Roman Catholic 'poor school' in an improvised Roman Catholic chapel and has been called St Joseph's since 1886. 

It has previously come under fire in another row where teachers called for Mrs Jones to resign after she was accused of being a 'liability' by parents.

Governors said in February they had investigated but dismissed the complaints and agreed lessons needed to be learned.

A number of parents came forward to say they were no longer happy with the school, which was once considered one of the best in the area.
