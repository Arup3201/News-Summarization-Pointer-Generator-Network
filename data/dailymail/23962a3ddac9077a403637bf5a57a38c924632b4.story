 

The BBC was yesterday forced to defend its decision to feature a rape scene in EastEnders after receiving 278 complaints about the episode.

Viewers complained the scenes were inappropriate, especially as the episode was broadcast an hour before the watershed.

Queen Vic landlady Linda Carter was raped by her nephew Dean Wicks in the controversial episode, which went out at 8pm on BBC1 on Monday.

Despite the rape being implied rather than explicitly depicted, a further 34 complaints were also made to television regulator Ofcom.

In a statement, the BBC said: ‘EastEnders has a rich history of tackling difficult issues and Linda’s story is one of these.

‘We have worked closely with Rape Crisis and other experts in the field to tell this story which we hope will raise awareness of sexual assaults and the issues surrounding them.

‘We have been extremely mindful of the content within the episode and the timeslot in which it was shown and at no point have there been any scenes of a graphic nature. In fact, the attack on Linda was implied and was not explicit.’

The watershed begins at 9pm and material unsuitable for children should not, in general, be shown before 9pm or after 5.30am.The episode was watched by a peak audience of 7.3 million.

It is not the first time EastEnders has been involved in a controversial or harrowing rape storyline.

In 2004, seven viewers complained to the BBC about an episode which focused on the distress of Little Mo Slater, who was assaulted in the Queen Vic pub by a customer.

Six complaints were received by Ofcom, which said it was concerned at the content, ‘given the mixed age ranges in the audience’. The BBC agreed it ‘was a degree more adult in tone than was appropriate’ for the pre-watershed time slot.

In 1988, Kathy Beale, played by Gillian Taylforth, was raped by James Willmott-Brown.

Speaking last week, actor Matt Di Angelo, who plays Dean Wicks, said he did not mind getting ‘abuse’ for playing a rapist if the shocking storyline helped real-life victims.

He said: ‘This show is so popular and you’re in people’s houses every night so to be associated with that crime, like I said if I have to get abuse on Twitter or a punch in the mouth, I’m fine with that as long as one person speaks out.’

In an interview with the Radio Times last week, actress Kellie Bright, who plays Linda Carter, was asked if she thinks EastEnders should be tackling such an issue pre-watershed.

Criticised: The show received 278 complaints about the episode

Response: EastEnders are now having to defend their decision to broadcast the distressing scenes one-hour before the watershed

She said: ‘Yes. EastEnders is a programme that is supposed to be reflective of real life and this issue is part of our society.

‘Why shouldn’t it be tackled? I think it’s been done in a really sensitive way.

‘It’s out there so it’s not going to be a shock to viewers and they have the option to make a decision not to watch it. It’s a way to educate people.’
