Ex-Labour minister Dennis MacShane was jailed for expenses fraud last week

Nearly half of the people who don’t vote say they can’t be bothered to turn up at the polls because they think MPs are ‘just on the take’.

46 per cent of non-voters agreed with the statement just a week after former Labour MP Denis MacShane was jailed for fraud.

The survey also found that 34 per cent of 18 to 25 year-olds said that anger or boredom best described how they felt about the current system.

And 64 per cent said that politicians don't keep their promises.

However, the vast majority of potential voters believe that the decisions politicians make are important, and claim to discuss politics with their friends.

Despite many admitting that they would not vote, only two per cent claimed it was because of the inconvenience of registering.

The poll, which was conducted on behalf of The Guardian, found that anger is particularly prevalent in Labour voters, northerners and those who have turned to newer parties like UKIP.

Lead by Nigel Farage, the party made significant gains in local elections this year, and two-thirds of UKIP supporters polled said that politics and politicians made them more angry than anything else.

Speaking to The Guardian, Conservative MP Chloe Smith, who became a minister at 31, said: 'We have to demonstrate what politics is for, why a young person's individual act in voting matters.'

They also agreed that this is a thought that would discourage them from turning out on polling day.

Mike Smithson, who runs the Political Betting website, claimed that the poll spells good news for UKIP, with little comfort for the most established parties.

He said: 'I think this is good news for UKIP and hard work for everyone else.'The coalition changed everything.

'The Conservatives are angry because they can't do what they would like to do, the Lib Dems are angry because they haven't been able to do anything.

'The coalition has made things a lot, lot worse and has affected how people feel about politics generally.'
