An East Tennessee couple have been charged with murder after an autopsy revealed the man's five-year-old daughter had been forced to drink more than two liters of grape soda and water.

Alexa Linboom was suffering from extreme brain damage when she was brought to an emergency room on January 1, 2012, by her father, Randall Vaughn and her stepmother, Mary.

An investigation found the young girl had been forced to drink the water and soda in one to two hours as punishment after taking one of her stepmother's drinks.

Murder charge: Randall and Mary Vaughn allegedly forced his daughter to drink excessive amounts of soda

The huge intake of fluid caused her brain to swell and herniate, which led to her death on January 3, 2012.

Vaughn, 41 ,and his wife, 58, have been charged with first-degree murder, two counts of aggravated child neglect and aggravated child abuse.

Attorney-general Berkeley Bell told the Times News that after allegedly forcing their child to drink an excessive amount of fluid, they failed to seek immediate medical help.

'Our position is it was a matter of several hours after the child started exhibiting serious symptoms, after the child was screaming out in pain, went into a paralyzed state, and became unconscious [that they sought help,' Bell said.

After a two-year investiagtion it was found that Alexa was killed by acute fluid intoxication , which caused hyponatremic encephalopathy.

Bell said there was no history of abuse on record at the Vaughan family home, but added: 'They did employ some alternative forms of punishment.'

'Allegedly the child, as a form of punishment, was forced to drink grape drinks, as well as a great deal of water, to the point that her body became water intoxicated,' Bell said. 'That led to her brain swelling and all of her systems shutting down, and to her eventual brain death.'

Alexa's biological mother lives out of state and six other children who were living in the Vaughan house are now in foster care.

The couple are being held on $500,000 bond and are due to appear in court on Friday.Â
