Move over, Leonardo Da Vinci... the Mona Lisa has been recreated by Pablo Picas-sew!

Artist Augusto Esquivel uses hundreds of thousands of buttons to create each of his unique pieces.

Each is painted individually and then left to dry before being hung from a clear shelf at the correct height.

Since he started making the hanging sculptures, he has made a version of Mona Lisa, a piano, a swing and a vending machine, among others.

Each of the eye-catching sculptures takes him about a month and a half to complete.

The process of making the pieces of art begins with making an arcylic box with thousands of holes in, from which the buttons can hang.

He then painstakingly paints each single button and waits for them to dry before hanging them precisely in place.

Making a splash: This shower is home to a rubber duck, while this fountain looks like an ideal bird bath too

Pick and mix: Buttons of various colours appear as bubblegum sweets and prizes

Augusto, 36, from Miami, US, said: 'I like the idea of something that looks solid and heavy but is actually light and inconsistent to the touch.

'The technique is always in development, it is always changing and it takes me some time to make each one look decent.

'I have always loved buttons for some unknown reason, and I keep discovering so much history behind them, it is really fascinating.

'I recently discovered a button fair, where people from all around the world trade and buy really unique and expensive buttons.

Button it! There won't be any music - loud or otherwise - being played on this piano

Bright and beautiful: A jukebox and a bunch of balloons are easily recognisable

Roll up, roll up: This candy floss stall is made from hundreds of buttons that hang down from an acrylic shelf

'I have so many shapes and materials to choose from, which makes them a really fun, ancient and noble object to work with.

'Also, I try to see the "personality" behind the buttons, I wonder what garment the button could have been a part of and the person who used the garment.

'The buttons are as alive as the people who wear them. So many people say to me, "I don't know why, but I keep my buttons for years, I can't trow them away!".'

The sculptor added: 'I don't really have a favourite because I like them all - it sounds like a cliche but it's true.'
