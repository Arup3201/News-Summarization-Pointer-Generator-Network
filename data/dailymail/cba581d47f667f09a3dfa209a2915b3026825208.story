Marcos Rojo appears to be settling into his English surroundings, after his girlfriend posted a picture on Instagram of him and his family sightseeing in London.

The new Manchester United man, who signed from Sporting Lisbon in the summer for £16 million, has played two games for Louis van Gaal's side since his arrival at Old Trafford.

The Argentinian's first match was a 4-0 win against QPR, but the Reds could not follow that up with another result as they fell to a 5-3 loss away at Leicester on Sunday.

As United were knocked out of the Capital One Cup by MK Dons and don't have a match midweek, Van Gaal rewarded his players with a day off, and Rojo headed to the capital.

Wearing a white cap and black jumper, Rojo appeared in his girlfriend's Instagram picture with his family, standing next to the Thames with the Houses of Parliament in the background.

Rojo was all smiles in the picture as he posed alongside his daughter, before heading back north to prepare for United's clash with West Ham on Saturday.
