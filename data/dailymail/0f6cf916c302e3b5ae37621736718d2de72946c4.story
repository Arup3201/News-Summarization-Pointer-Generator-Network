President Obama may be earning the favor of his Irish ancestors by attending the G8 conference with his family but it is stirring the ire of American taxpayers outraged by the cost of the trip.

The two-day trip around the Republic is expected to cost U.S. taxpayers more than $5.2million.

The President, his wife and daughters touched down in Belfast amid the biggest security operation ever mounted in Northern Ireland.

While Obama holds talks with other world leaders at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland, Michelle and their girls headed to the Republic.

Glamor: Michelle Obama and her daughters are believed to be staying in a $3,300-a-night suite at the Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin's city center

Mrs Obama and her daughters are staying at the Shelbourne Hotel and according to the Irish Independent, her entourage has booked out  30 rooms in the five-star accommodation.

The Shelbourne Hotel is one of 
Dublin's oldest and sits in the center of the city overlooking the 
public park St Stephen's Green.

It is understood that Michelle will stay in the luxurious $3,300-a-night Princess Grace suite.

A team of staff were out cleaning the front of the building in preparation for the First family's arrival as the usual swarm of FBI agents hovered around.

Though the White House does not release the specifics on how much the trip actaully cost, the $5.2million estimate comes based on the reported cost of the first couple's one-day trip to IReland in 2011 which tallied a $2.6million bill.

This two-day trip is likely to cost double that amount taking into account that his daughters now need a security detail and the family have split up into two locations.  

For this trip, Air Force One arrived at Aldergrove International Airport, 20 miles north of the city, where the President emerged from the plane with his family.

On Monday evening, the First Lady made a short speech before watching a special performance of Riverdance at the Gaiety Theatre, a short distance from her city center hotel.

On arrival at the Waterfront, the family were greeted by Northern Ireland's First and Deputy First Ministers Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness.

Roads into and out of Belfast were closed to facilitate the president's visit.

Hundreds of police 4x4s lined the streets, while the Police Service of Northern Ireland helicopter patrolled the skies over the city.

Thousands of extra police officers were deployed to the province ahead of the G8 summit.

Trips on Air Force One cost the government about $180,000 per flight hour.

According to a book published last year Obama and his family cost the taxpayer $1.4billion per year.

This is far from the first presidential trip that prompted criticism among conservatives, as Mr Obama's recent appearances in Israel cost taxpayers an estimated $10.9million.
