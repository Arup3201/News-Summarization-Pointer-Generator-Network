Boko Haram fighters have massacred more than 100 people in the north Cameroon town of Fotokol.

Militants from the terrorist Islamist group murdered residents inside their own homes and at a mosque on Tuesday. Many of the dead were found with their throats slit, according to a local newspaper.

The raid comes amid a major offensive by Cameroon and its neighbouring African states against Boko Haram, which has killed thousands and kidnapped hundreds in Nigeria and  begun to mount increasingly bloody cross-border raids.

'Boko Haram entered Fotokol through Gambaru early in the morning and they killed more than 100 people in the mosque, in the houses and they burned property,' said the civic leader Abatchou Abatcha, whose own son was shot dead during the raid. 

Cameroon's information minister Issa Tchiroma said the Cameroon army had pushed Boko Haram out of the border town after heavy fighting, which killed 50 militants and six of its own soldiers.

The Sunni Muslim jihadist group is seen as the main security threat to Nigeria, Africa's biggest economy and top oil producer which will hold a presidential election on February 14. 

On Thursday, extremists on the run from the three-nation offensive took revenge on civilians in Fotokol, shooting and burning scores to death and razing mosques and churches. 

Cameroonian officials said more than 500 wounded people are trapped in the town where fighting continued Thursday. They said Boko Haram fighters are using civilians as shields.   

The African Union last week authorised a regional force of 7,500 troops to fight the militants.

In neighbouring Chad, state television reported its army had 'completely wiped out' Boko Haram bases at Gambaru and Ngala in northern Nigeria on Tuesday, killing more than 200 militants with nine Chad losses.

Cameroon's information minister Issa Tchiroma said the Cameroon army, supported by Chadian forces, had pushed Boko Haram out of the border town after heavy fighting, which killed 50 militants and six of its own soldiers

Chadian TV footage on Wednesday showed jubilant Chadian soldiers cheering near to the bodies of what it said were two Boko Haram fighters. 

Chad and Cameroon are deploying thousands of troops and Niger has reinforced its border against the militant group which has been fighting for five years to create an Islamist emirate.

But analysts say they are facing an uphill battle against a sect that has already seen off major offensives by Nigeria's military.

'Whether through intimidation, opportunism or genuine support for the radical Islamist cause, local communities continue to swell Boko Haram's ranks,' said Roddy Barclay, senior Africa analyst at consultancy Control Risks.

Chad, reputed to have one of the region's best militaries, has carried out air strikes on insurgent positions over the last few days.  France is also sending aircraft from its base in the Chadian capital to carry out surveillance missions in the border area.
