Toys that contain powerful lasers such as the lightsaber could cause permanent eye damage

Toys that contain small lasers could cause serious injuries and even blindness, health authorities have warned.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has flagged up that many toys, such as lightsabers and spinning tops, contain powerful lasers that can cause permanent damage to the eye.

Laser injuries do not usually hurt, but vision can deteriorate slowly over time.

These injuries may go unnoticed for days and even weeks, and could be permanent, they said.

‘A beam shone directly into a person's eye can injure it in an instant, especially if the laser is a powerful one,' Dan Hewett, health promotion officer at the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in an FDA release.

He said that the toys that most typically cause damage include lasers mounted on toy guns that can be used for aiming, spinning tops that project beams while they spin, hand-held lasers used during play as lightsabers and lasers intended for entertainment that create optical effects in an open room.

He added that advertisers often promote their toys as playthings, so parents and children believe they're harmless.

But this is often not the case and vigilance must be maintained by parents while children play with the electronic toys.

In recent years, the power of lasers has increased while prices have fallen, Mr Hewitt added.

The FDA recommends that users never aim or shine a laser directly at any person or animal.

In some cases the light energy from a laser aimed into the eye can be even more dangerous than staring directly into the sun.

They also advise not to aim a laser at any reflective surface.

In addition to this, they say to keep in mind that the startling effect of a bright beam of light can cause serious accidents when aimed at a driver in a car or lead to injuries among people doing other activities, such as playing sports.
