Mike McQueary, a former assistant football coach at Penn State and witness during Jerry Sandusky's trial, told players in 2011 that was had been sexually abused as a boy, according to a new report from ESPN.

McQueary, in a November 9 2011 closed-door meeting with a dozen Nittany Lions players, said that could identify with the boy he saw in a shower with Sandusky in 2001 because he too was abused as a child, the report says.

The report's sources include two players who were part of the meeting and four others who were aware of it. They told ESPN McQueary did not say who abused him nor the duration of the abuse.

The meeting, the report says, was held just days after prosecutors said that McQueary had seen Sandusky and a young boy 'engaged in anal intercourse' in 2001.

Patrick Flanagan, then a redshirt freshman, told ESPN the Magazine that McQueary broke down in tears during the meeting.

'He said he had some regret that he didn't stop it,' Flanagan told the magazine.Â  'We didn't want to see someone we looked up to get emotional. It was heartbreaking for all of us. We weren't sure who to believe. You see an older man crying, someone you looked up to. It's sad.'

McQueary, ESPN notes, is expected to testify against former Penn State president Graham Spanier, former athletic director Tim Curley and former vice president Gary Schultz. They are charged with multiple crimes, including failure to report suspected abuse and conspiracy.

In 2012, Sandusky was convicted on 45 of 48 counts of child sexual abuse -- and was not found guilty on all three counts involving the alleged rape of 'Victim 2' that McQueary said he saw in 2001

All three men have said they did not hear from McQueary that Sandusky sexually assaulted a boy in the shower.

In 2012, Sandusky was convicted on 45 of 48 counts of child sexual abuse -- and was not found guilty on all three counts involving the alleged rape of 'Victim 2' that McQueary said he saw.

McQueary is now unemployed, separated from his wife Barbara and lives at his parents' home, the report continues.

McQueary's gambling will likely be brought up at the trial if defense lawyers are allowed to ask about his character, according to ESPN. He allegedly gambled while a student and later used a bookie, according to its sources.

McQueary's father also allegedly paid off his debts worth thousands of dollars.

'It got pretty bad,' one source told the magazine. 'And it just kept snowballing and snowballing. He was very impulsive.'

McQueary has also filed a $4 million lawsuit against Penn State after his contract was not renewed during the summer of 2012. McQueary's complaint says he 'irreparable harm to his ability to earn a living' because of his testimony in the Sandusky case and at a preliminary hearing for Curley and Schultz, ESPN said.
