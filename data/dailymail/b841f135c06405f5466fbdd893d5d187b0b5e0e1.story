A mansion described as the 'finest newly constructed house in London' has had its asking price slashed by £30 million in a staggering cut-price deal.

The luxury home in St John's Wood, just a stone's throw from Lord's cricket ground, has 11 bedrooms, 10 bathrooms, five reception rooms and a leisure complex.

It boasts a marble-lined entrance, a ten-passenger lift, flamed mahogany panelled study and an underground car park with enough room for five vehicles.

The property is spread across five floors and measures an enormous 21,600sq/ft - more than 20 times the size of the average new UK home.

It was originally listed for sale with an asking price of £65 million.

But this has now been reduced by a staggering £30 million, with the home now being marketed for 'in excess of £35 million'.

The reduction prompts fears the 
high-end property bubble is about to burst, with one expert saying the 
queue for buyers has 'reduced to a trickle'.

High end: The property is built to the 'highest imaginable specification' with deluxe gold sofas and chandeliers

Cinema: The homeowner can treat their guests to a film in the cinema with space to seat 10 comfortably

Buying
 agent Henry Pryor revealed there are a number of multi-million pound 
homes for sale on the same road, including one which has been reduced by
 24 per cent over the past 12 months.

He said: 'The market has softened in 
the past year and people can't be so cavalier with their asking prices. 
It can punish those who are over-ambitious.

'Canny
 buyers now appreciate that you no longer have to pay ticket price and 
the queue of potential buyers for these mega-sales has reduced to a 
trickle.

Plush: The entire house, including the master bedroom, is coated in gold satin and velvet with art and flowers

High end: The initial asking price of £65m made it 209 times the sale price of £167,000 for a typical English house

Wine cellar: The basement is as glittering as the house upstairs, with custom-made fridges and crates

'Those selling need to put their egos to one side and listen to the advice of their agent. Price for today, not for yesterday.'

The home on a leafy street near Lord's cricket ground in St John's Wood, is being marketed by high-end estate agents Savills and Knight Frank.

Neither agent would comment on the mansion, which has a teak-panelled games room with a snooker table, cinema and temperature-controlled wine cellar with bar and tasting areas.

The brochure says the house has been 'built to the highest imaginable specification and designed with impeccable taste'.

It is described as London's finest new home and built to ambassadorial standards.

The reduction is thought to have attracted the attention of the Candy brothers, who are behind One Hyde Park, and the developer Marcus Cooper.

But its drop in price proves claims the high end of the market is experiencing its own recession, one estate agent claimed yesterday.

Trevor Abrahmsohn, who runs Glentree Estates and specialises in selling multi-million pound trophy homes, says business is down 50 per cent this year.

The super-agent claims the hike in 
stamp duty on homes above £2 million from five to seven per cent along 
with the loom of a mansion tax and introduction of a capital gains tax 
for foreign investors has caused major problems.

He
 said: 'It is easy to think increasing stamp duty from 5 per cent to 7 
per cent is only a small amount but this is a 40 per cent increase and 
that is a lot of money on these properties.

'If you're buying a home for £2 million, you're paying £40,000 extra in stamp duty and it is putting buyers off.

'Speak
 to anyone in London and they will say there is a bubble but speak to a 
lot of agents and they'll tell you they're doing badly.'
