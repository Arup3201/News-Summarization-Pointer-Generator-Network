Bake sale: Saira Munoz could be deported over her arrest for selling pot brownies in school

A California student arrested for selling pot brownies to raise money for her prom dress could be deported to Mexico.

Saira Munoz came up with the money-making scheme while at River Valley High School last year and even employed a fellow student to help sell the brownies.

But the teenager, who was 18 at the time, was arrested after a student fell sick and had to be taken to hospital after eating one of the drug-laced cakes.

Munoz was sentenced to nine days in prison and four years' probation on Monday but the teenager was also told she could face being deported after her sentence ends.

Because she arrived in the U.S. in 2000 with only temporary permission to remain in the country, her felony charge for employing a minor to sell marijuana could be used as reason to send her back to Mexico.

Friends of the former student, who currently works in a restaurant, are upset that she could face deportation for her mistakes.

'I was hurt, because she got arrested, and nobody wanted to see somebody we cared about go away,' Carlos Robles, who went to school with Munoz, told CBS News.

'There's people that deserve to be deported, and she just wasn't one of them. There's people that do way worse,' he added.

Munoz was convicted of felony child 
endangerment and misdemeanor possession of marijuana on school grounds 
after admitting to selling the cakes in March last year.

School dance: Saira Munoz planned to sell pot brownies to raise money for a prom dress

She told officers she obtained the drugs from an acquaintance, and planned to use the money she made to buy a dress for the school dance.

Two minors were issued citations for helping in the distribution of the pot brownies and were released, the Appeal Democrat reported.

As he sentenced her, Judge Brian Aronson told the teenager: 'If you are departed, you must not return unless you do so legally. If you do return, you must check in with probation immediately.'
