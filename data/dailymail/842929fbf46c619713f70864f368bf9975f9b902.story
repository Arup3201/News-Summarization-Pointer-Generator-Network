Police have launched an investigation to find thieves who intricately unearthed memorial geraniums planted in honour of First World War soldiers.

More than 80 of the 500 commemorative plants in Dunham Massey, Cheshire, were carefully dug out of the soil in two late-night attacks.

It is thought the thieves were jealous and wanted the red flowers for their own gardens 

Distraught: 86 of 500 memorial geraniums  in Dunham Massey, Cheshire, to honour First World War soldiers were 'intricately' dug up in late-night raids. Paul Lord, chair of the parish council, said the thieves were jealous

'Calculated': Mr Lord said the attack was too clean to be done by vandals as police interview villagers

Parish Council chairman Paul Lord said: 'It is clear to us all that they have been taken by people who are so impressed with the displays that they want them in their own gardens. It is either that or people think that they can sell them on at car boot sales or something similar.

'Each time the flowers have been taken away very carefully so it cannot be vandals otherwise they would have been strewn everywhere.

'It seems to us all that these plants have just ended up in a lot of people’s gardens.' 

The £300 flowers were planted last week as part of the village's efforts to mark the centenary of the First World War.

Two days later, residents awoke to find 40 of the poppy-red geraniums missing. 

The next morning, a further 46 had been intricately dug up. 

Police have now been dispatched to the rural Cheshire community - where the population is just 475 - to take statements about the thefts in what is being dubbed a 'bloom-dunnit' by locals.

Honour: The red plants, a nod to poppies, were bedded last week in honour of First World War soldiers

Investigation: Police have been dispatched to the Saxon town, which has one of Britain's lowest crime rates

Villager Susan Brotherton, 59, said: 'It’s despicable really, what some people will do in this day and age. Flowers have been stolen before but not on this scale - and they obviously wanted them.

'I doubt very much people from round here will have taken them. It’s a nice area and people would not steal from the neighbours. It’s such a shame because there is never any crime in Dunham Massey.

'It would nice to think they would put the plants back after the upset that has been caused - but I’m not holding my breath.'

Jane Leopold, who lives on a barge near to the village and works at a tea room said: 'Nothing bad ever happens here so it’s a shock.

'The people who did this must be putting the plants in their own garden. It’s terrible. It was a nice thing to do to have the flowers so it just shows what people are like today.

'It’s such a shame but it won’t be anyone from the village. We’ve never had anything stolen in Dunham before. It’s the kind of place where you can leave your stuff outside and no one will take it.'

Catherine Bushell, 75, lives in the village, said: 'We were all devastated. A lot of people had put a lot of time into making this flower bed look lovely.

'It’s always had a nice show of flowers so I don’t know why anyone would want to ruin it. They must want to sell them I guess.

Search: Mr Lord has urged police to check people's gardens for the plants after the rare attack on the village

Historic: The quaint village of 450 people in leafy Cheshire has 45 listed buildings and a 197-acre deer park

'The villagers have been talking about nothing else but no-one can think who it might be who is responsible. My son’s a farmer so he helped fetch the plants and plant them so it’s a shame it has been ruined.'

In a statement Greater Manchester Police said: 'Officers answered a report of 86 plants being taken from flower beds. The circumstances of where they were taken is unknown but inquiries are continuing.' 

The former Saxon village, which is listed in the Domesday Book, has one of the lowest crime rates in Britain.

Known for its magnificent Georgian stately home, it has a 197-acre deer park that dates back to 1353. 

The name Dunham is derived from the Anglo-Saxon ‘dun’ meaning hill. The Massey element of the name is a result of its ownership by the Massey family. 

Dunham Massey Hall became the home of the manorial lord and was built in 1616 and is currently owned by the National Trust. 

In the village there are 45 listed residences, most of them dating from the 18th or early 19th century, and many of them featuring Flemish bond brickwork.
