One unsuspecting bride received a very special surprise after her husband enlisted several celebs to congratulate her on her wedding day.

Peter Capaldi, who plays Doctor Who, Game of Thrones' Kerry Ingram and Pat Sharp were just some of the celebrity well-wishers to take part in a recorded video organised by the groom. 

Not satisfied with your average wedding speech the groom Jamie McKee, from Cardiff, wanted to treat his new wife Nicole Crees to a surprise video and a surprise it was.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO 

Jamie McKee arranged for actors from his wife's favourite TV shows to record a special message for her on her wedding day

Jamie, 32, tricked his bride into thinking it was just your average wedding video with the first few messages coming from Jamie himself, his sister Sara Owen, Nicole's best friend Toni Jones and the best man Christopher Bliss.

However, once Christopher had finished his recorded message for the couple, to the bride's surprise Neighbours star Alan Fletcher (who plays Dr Karl Kennedy) steps in to congratulate the happy couple.

He is then followed by the likes of Peter Capaldi, Pat Sharp and Broardchurch star Joe Sims all of whom had recorded their own unique message.

Doctor Who actor Peter Capaldi was enlisted to help out, luckily both Jamie and Nicole have appeared as extras on the show so Jamie was able to contact him

The video went down without a hitch with the 25-year-old bride left utterly astounded and Jamie admitted it really had been a labour of love.

Jamie, who met Nicole when they starred in a student film together and married in St Peter's Hall in Cardiff on September 27 said he took months to organise the video but was really pleased with the results. 

'It wasn't easy and I think Nicole thought I was spending a bit too much time on my phone but I'm really pleased with the results and she laughed and cried, which is something I hoped she would do.'

Other celebrities who recorded personal messages included Game of Thrones actress Kerry Ingram (left) and Ewen McIntosh, who played Big Keith in The Office (right)

Luckily for Jamie he was able to make the impossible possible with his handy connections within the acting industry. 

'I managed to get hold of some people via Facebook or Twitter, but Nicole and I have both worked as extras on Doctor Who so I asked one of the crew if he could ask Peter Capaldi for me and he emailed me the video a couple of days later.'

In his message the Doctor Who star plays on his TV character saying: 'Hi Nicole, many, many happy congratulations on your wedding to Jamie. 

Neighbours star Alan Fletcher told the bride that she was lucky to be marrying such a great guy

'I don't know whether I am early, late or on time, I don't know whether I am coming or going because I play a Time Lord as you know and all that really matters is that you two are going to have a wonderful time together and you're going to spend the rest of your lives together. So, have a wonderful happy life, all the best from Doctor Who.'

Alan Fletcher, was quick to remind Nicole how lucky she was to be marrying Jamie and was one of the more excitable celebrities on film.

'How exciting is this? You are getting married! And not only that you are marrying a great guy in Jamie and not only that you are getting married in one of my favourite places in the world, Cardiff. 

'I hope you and Jamie have a great wedding day today and a wonderful, wonderful life together. You deserve it.'

Nicole was completely shocked by her surprise video, saying that it was her perfect fairytale wedding 

Broadchurch's Joe Sims even offered to join the pair on their honeymoon. There were also messages from This is England stars Thomas Turgoose, Jo Hartley and Vicky McClure, with Welsh boyfriend Jonathan Owen as well as Kerry Ingram from Game of Thrones, High Hopes star Boyd Clack and Being Humans star Michael Socha, who recorded a message from a film set in Vancouver.

One of Jamie's former acting colleagues Ewen McIntosh, who played Big Keith in The Office, also congratulates Nicole, who works in the cash office at Tesco at Culverhouse Cross, and pays homage to budding actor Jamie, who is a vocational learning adviser.

Nicole, who honeymooned with Jamie in Mexico, said she couldn't have been happier with her surprise and was still in shock. 

'It was my perfect fairytale wedding. I couldn't believe it when I saw the video.

'Jamie and I had watched all the programmes together so for him to get people like Michael Socha from Being Human and the guys from This Is England was fantastic.

'I'm a huge fan of Susie Dent from Countdown and he's managed to get a message from her too.

'He seemed to be spending loads of time on his phone and I wanted to just throw it away but now I know what he was up to. I'm still overwhelmed.'
