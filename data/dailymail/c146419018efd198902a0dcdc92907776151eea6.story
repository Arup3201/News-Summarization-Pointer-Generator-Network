These images show the incredible moment a heron plucks a duckling from the water and swallows it in a single gulp.

The large bird, spotted in Adel Dam Nature Reserve, West Yorkshire, approaches its prey, grabs it and attempts to hold it under the water before finishing it off.

Photographer Chris Hyslop, 66, witnessed the grim struggle - which lasted five minutes -and captured the images.

Swing: The bird - which would usually eat fish - swings the duckling back and forth as it struggles

The heron - a bird which usually chooses fish for its prey - is thought to be around three years old and well-practised in its duck-catching technique.  

Mr Hyslop said: 'I initially went down to try and get a picture of the heron in flight - they look quite extraordinary when they’re flying.

'The heron was fishing, wading around the water looking for something to eat.

'Then, all of a sudden, the heron spotted this mallard chick, which I would say was probably a couple of months old, and took maybe two steps very quickly towards it, before grabbing it in his mouth. 

'He was shaking it around, which I think made the chick very disorientated, then the heron held it under the water.

'The whole thing lasted about five or six minutes, he probably didn’t want to swallow it while it was still moving so did his best to stop it from moving.

Gone: The heron can finally be seen swallowing the duckling for good after the five-minute struggle

'He didn’t rush about it, but I could see that digesting it was a struggle. The way he did it, I’m pretty sure he’d done it before.

'After that, he relaxed for a little while, but not long after he tried to go for another chick.

'Then he spotted a group of young coot chicks, and tried to go for one of them. But these ones were much younger than the chick he’d already eaten, so the parents were still around.

'I think the mallard chick had been left to fend for itself, so was more vulnerable.'

Chris, of Leeds, West Yorkshire, added: 'I’ve never seen anything like it before.'
