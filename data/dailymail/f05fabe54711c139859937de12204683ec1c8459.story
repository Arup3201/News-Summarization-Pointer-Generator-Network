John Craven is one of the oldest presenters on the BBC and is best known for more factual programming such as Countryfile, which he has presented since 1989. The 74-year-old was recently given a new TV show

For John Craven, being given a new show at the age of 74 is certainly a great achievement.

But for his former Countryfile colleague Miriam O’Reilly, the news comes tinged with irony.

Craven was the main presenter when Miss O’Reilly, 57, was sacked from Countryfile in 2009 – a decision for which she successfully sued the BBC for age discrimination.

She has since repeatedly accused the BBC of bias against older women, and says the decision to give Craven his own quiz show, Beat The Brain, makes her ‘laugh out loud’ because the BBC ‘still doesn’t get it’.

Yesterday’s announcement of Craven’s new role came a day after a damning report accused the BBC of not giving enough opportunities to older women. 

Lord Best, who chaired the House of Lords investigation into women in current affairs broadcasting, claimed female presenters ‘become invisible’ after the age of 50.

But Miss O’Reilly said Craven’s latest appointment proves that the problem stretches beyond news and current affairs.

She said: ‘I am very fond of John and I’m delighted for him but I would also say I’m looking forward to the day when I see a woman of his age, with white hair, with his little paunch and his wrinkles being given the same opportunity. 

'Some people will say you’ve got Anne Robinson who did The Weakest Link but she is stretched beyond recognition, she’s a size eight.

‘She might want to do that but a lot of women feel that is what they have to do to keep working.’

Miss O'Reilly was dropped from Countryfile before it was relaunched with younger presenters, which included Matt Baker (left), Julia Bradbury (centre) and veteran broadcaster Craven (right)

She added: ‘That’s the problem that we have, men are allowed to age and women are not. You have to laugh, otherwise you’ll go mad.’

Craven is one of the oldest presenters on the BBC – although still lags behind Sir David Attenborough, 88, and David Dimbleby, 76. He is best known for more factual programming such as Countryfile, which he has presented since 1989, and Newsround, for 17 years prior to that.

A spokesman for the BBC pointed to Angela Rippon, 70, who presents Rip Off Britain, The Great British Bake Off’s Mary Berry, 79, and Petula Clark, 82, as older women who host shows for the corporation.

Miss Clark has been commissioned for a new show, Chanson: The Story Of French Music, which will be broadcast on BBC4 later this year.

Miss O’Reilly was sacked from Countryfile when it moved to Sunday evenings on BBC1 in 2009, and went on to successfully sue the BBC for age discrimination.

The programme relaunched with younger presenters Julia Bradbury and Matt Baker, along with veteran broadcaster Craven.

At the time Craven told Radio Times he was ‘incredibly lucky’ to have survived 12 different producers.
