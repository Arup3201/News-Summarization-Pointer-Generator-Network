He is the latest new resident of Albert Square having signed up to play ill-tempered retired fishmonger Stan Carter.

But Timothy West said yesterday he realises he is in the minority when it comes to TV soaps and older people.

The 79-year-old star, who is married to actress Prunella Scales, enjoyed a guest stint as businessman Eric Babbage in Coronation Street last year and has now joined BBC1 soap EastEnders.

Timothy West, 79, now plays grandfather Stan Carter in EastEnders. He said that soap operas undervalued older people

Asked whether there are enough older 
people in soaps, he told Radio Times: 'I find they’re not valued so much
 and I suspect that’s one of the reasons why I’ve been brought in (to 
EastEnders).

'From what I hear, there hasn’t been enough interest in older characters. Or enough older characters to be interested in.'

The veteran actor said that he 
signed up to play Stan Carter 'because it’s a good part' and will see 
him perform alongside Albert Square veteran and co-star June Brown who 
plays long-suffering Dot. West said he had 'enormous respect' for Miss 
Brown.

EastEnders, 
whose new faces include hardman actor Danny Dyer, 36, as Queen Vic 
landlord and Stan’s son Mick Carter, has been undergoing a revamp as 
part of an attempt to reinvigorate the drama following a ratings slump.

Annette Badland, 63, who plays busybody Babe Smith, was also brought into the soap to help reinvigorate its older generation.

West
 said of today’s television: 'I do miss things like the single play. It 
was the event of the week. Now you have more channels, you don’t get 
that conversation at the bus stop about what you saw last night.'

Asked whether he had any guilty TV 
pleasures, he joked: 'Things I’m a little bit ashamed of? Well, I don’t 
watch any porn! To be honest, I don’t think I watch enough television to
 feel guilty about it.'

The
 actor and his wife, actress Prunella Scales, recently embarked on four 
canal journeys across Britain for a More4 documentary.

In the series, West told how former Fawlty Towers star Scales has been suffering from 'a sort of mild Alzheimer’s'.

In 2012 a BBC report revealed TV viewers feel that the elderly get less air-time than other age groups, and older women in particular are ‘invisible’, a BBC report reveals.

The research showed viewers felt there was a perceived habit of treating the elderly as ‘peripheral’ or ‘token figures’ in drama, comedy and entertainment shows.

They said the elderly were treated as ‘props’ for other stories, and regularly portrayed in a ‘humorous’, ‘mocking’ or ‘insulting’ manner.

Pensioners were often said to be portrayed as stubborn with a ‘tendency to moan about things’ or in some cases as an ‘adorable idiot’.
