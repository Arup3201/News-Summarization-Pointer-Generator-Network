Paul Woodland, 32, drowned during a Special Boat Service exercise off Saunton Sands, North Devon, in October 2012

A Royal Marine drowned in a ‘freak accident’ during a Special Forces training exercise after he became trapped under a boat when it was capsized by a large wave.

Paul Woodland, 32, was thrown out of the 15 foot long twin engine rigid inflatable boat (RIB) after both engines failed and it was overturned by a ‘six-foot’ wave.

He became trapped underneath the boat after his dry suit apparently became snagged on one of the failed engines. His four comrades quickly realised he was in trouble and within around 90 seconds they dragged him clear but he was unconscious.

The fatal incident occurred during a Special Boat Service exercise off Saunton Sands, North Devon, in October 2012.

Mr Woodland, from Cardiff, Wales, was flown to North Devon District Hospital in Barnstaple after he was pulled from the water but he was pronounced dead a few minutes after his arrival.

The Marine, based at Poole, Dorset, was taking part in a five-week course in which he was training to be in the Special Boat Service. If successful on the course, Marines can be selected for the elite Special Forces unit of the Naval Service.

Details of Mr Woodland’s tragic death only emerged yesterday when four of his commando comrades gave evidence at an inquest.

The Marines, who appeared behind screens at the inquest in Barnstaple, North Devon, were identified only as Soldiers B, C, D and F.

The Greater Devon coroner Dr Elizabeth Earland said their anonymity was 'in deference to requirements of national security'.

The men gave graphic accounts of the incident which was heard by Mr Woodland’s family and fiancé who attended the inquest.

They told how both engines on the RIB became flooded and inoperable by large breaking waves during the exercise.

Solider C, the helmsman, said he had not come across engines jamming before but both he and Soldier B tried ten times to re-start them - but they were unable to and the RIB lost its steering and was hit by the waves.

Soldier C said the waves were 'four to five feet high' and a large wave hit them, capsizing the inflatable boat and flipping out all five of the crew.

He said being under the water 'felt like being in a washing machine' before he popped back up to the surface.

He said they were 50-75 metres from the shore and the crew shouted out their number and said 'okay' but there was a pause when they reached number five who was Mr Woodland.

He said: ‘We were a man down. Soldier B shouted that he was trapped under the boat.’

Soldier B 
told the inquest he saw Mr Woodland's leg sticking out from the sea and 
was 'kicking' out at the rear of the boat by the engines.

He said Mr Woodland was in the water for about '30 seconds' when he grabbed his leg and arm and tried to pull him out.

He
 felt Mr Woodland had become snagged saying: ‘I could not see but I 
formed the opinion he became snagged between the engines and something 
on his dry suit.’

He said he 'pulled as hard as I could', while another crewman helped to free him.

Soldier B said: ‘I could see Paul's face was blue.’

They fired safety flares which alerted safety jet skis to the scene after realising Mr Woodland was trapped. He was pulled to shore and taken in a military ambulance to the top of the beach where he was flown to hospital by air ambulance.

The Marines said they had been drilled properly and had the right kit and were all prepared for the training exercise.

They
 were all wearing dry suits, their own military clothing, a helmet, a 
knife to free themselves if they got snagged, a smoke flare and an 
uninflated life jacket.

Soldier B said: ‘It was quite an upsetting experience. This was a tragic accident.’

Soldier
 F said the exercise was part of a boat handlers course for Royal 
Marines and said this was the first time he had lost a 'student in troop
 training'.

He said losing both engines on the RIB was a 'freak accident'.

Soldier D estimated that Mr Woodland was in the water for between 'one minute and 90 seconds'.

He said: ‘There was nothing more we could have done to save him.’

The inquest heard that Mr Woodland, who was a strong swimmer, was a 'fit and healthy man' who died from 'immersion in water, drowning'.

He had not suffered any significant 
injuries but the weight of the boat on top of him and the 'subsequent 
disorientation resulted in his drowning', medical experts told the 
inquest.

Soldier E 
told the inquest there had been capsizes during exercises in the past. 
But he said: ‘It was not what was intended but it may happen.’

He
 said the two RIBS were to 'punch through the surf' but the boats were 
not competing against each other and there was no time pressure.

He
 said: ‘In my opinion it was a tragic accident. Nothing more could have 
been done to help Paul, the incident happened so quickly.’

Coroner Dr Elizabeth Earland concluded the inquest by recording a verdict of accidental death.

She said: ‘The RIB went into the surf and hit a very large wave, six foot plus.’

She said the swamped boat capsized and Mr Woodland became trapped by the engines and drowned.

The Special Boat Service (SBS) is the special forces unit of the Naval Service

The Special Boat Service (SBS) is the special forces unit of the Naval Service.

It
 was founded in 1940 during the Second World War, when it started as the
 Special Boat. In the 1980s it was renamed as the Special Boat 
Service.

The SBS is under the Operational Command of Director Special Forces and is based in Hamworthy Barracks in Poole, Dorset.

The
 Royal Navy said its role is to ‘be carrying out daring, undercover 
raids using the element of surprise possible with small, highly-trained 
teams’.

The SBS 
is manned by ranks drawn mostly from the Royal Marines and its main 
tasks include intelligence gathering, counter-terrorism operations 
(surveillance or offensive action), sabotage and the disruption of enemy
 infrastructure, capture of specific individuals, close protection of 
senior politicians and military personnel, plus reconnaissance and 
combat action on foreign territory.

Around 200 to 250 service personnel make up the SBS at any one time and once qualified, they are known as ‘Swimmer Canoeists’.

They
 are elite military personnel who show physical and mental aptitude to 
make the step up to the next level. Many have served in Afghanistan and 
Iraq.

They are also experts in swimming, diving, parachuting, navigation, demolition and reconnaissance.

Members of the SBS wear a green commando beret with their own cap badge.
