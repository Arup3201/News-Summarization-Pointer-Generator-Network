Ed Miliband's grandfather Dawid Kozak who died in 1945 in the Nazi concentration camp Buchenwald

Ed Miliband has revealed that he is finally ready to visit the Nazi concentration camp where his grandfather was murdered.

The Labour leader said he was considering a pilgrimage to the infamous Buchenwald death camp in Germany to keep the memory of his maternal grandfather alive.

Mr Miliband knew from an early age that Dawid Kozak had died in an extermination camp, but only learned the full horror of his death six months ago after visiting Israel where he discovered the only known picture of his Polish relative.

The Labour leader, who has now released the poignant photograph, discovered that Dawid, a Polish Jew, was worked to death by Nazi guards aged just 36.

He is among 60 of Mr Miliband’s relatives on both sides of his family to have been murdered by the Nazis.

Mr Miliband, 45, said: ‘It has taken us almost 70 years to find out the truth.

‘But it's still very hard to take in. We had thought he died in Auschwitz, but he died building a Nazi airstrip in a camp called Harzungen.’ This was part of the Buchenwald death camp in Germany.

‘Justine and I discussed what we would tell the boys,’ he said.

‘We told them their great-grandfather died in the war. They are too young now for more than that.’

Dawid had arrived at Harzungen late in the war and he died only three months before the camp was liberated by US soldiers in 1945.

Asked if he was now ready to visit the camp where his grandfather died, the Labour leader told the Mirror: ‘I’m thinking about it, yes.’

Labour leader Ed Miliband revealed the recent discovery of his grandfather's murder in an interview with BBC Five Live at their studios in Salford this morning

Ed Miliband’s mother Marion grew up in the Jewish quarter of Czestochowa in southern Poland.

Marion, born Dobra Jenta Kozak, was saved from the Nazis as a six year old girl by a Catholic family called the Sitkowskas, who risked their lives hiding her and her family.

In April, on his trip to Israel, Ed was reunited with his long-lost 84-year-old Aunt Sarah Ben Zvi - his mother's cousin, also sheltered by the Sitkowskas.

Ed's dad Ralph was born in Belgium in 1924, the son of a Polish leather craftsman.

In 1940 as the Nazis occupied Belgium, 16-year-old Ralph and his dad Samuel walked the 70 miles to Ostend and escaped on one of the last boats to Dover.

Samuel fought the Nazis by joining the Russian Red Army, Ralph joined the Royal Navy.

His family had been too upset by the tragedy of losing so many relatives to feel ready to visit Auschwitz.

‘I want to keep his memory alive,’ he said. ‘As the survivors of the Holocaust die off we have to keep the memory alive to stop it happening ever again.’

Earlier this week Mr Miliband admitted the Holocaust Memorial Day commemorations were 'really emotional' for him and other Jewish families affected by the genocide.

He said his family had not talked much about the Holocaust growing up.

Mr Miliband said: 'It's 70 years since my grandfather died in one of the camps and I marked that about ten days ago.

'And you know, it's really hard this, because I talked to my mum about this: it's not the kind of thing you talked about very much when you're growing up in a household affected by these things, but it sort of marks you and it's so important that we remember.

'I think the theme of Holocaust Memorial Day this year is keep the memory alive. And as you say, Nicky, when there's prejudice around the world, when we see the rise of anti-Semitism, it's incredibly important that we keep that memory alive.'

He explained how he had only just found out about the circumstances surrounding his grandfather's death.

'I know this sounds almost unbelievable, but it's only about six months ago that we discovered the full circumstances of what happened to my grandfather.

'He ended up in Germany in a labour camp, which is where he eventually died according to the records. I went to Yad Vashem, the place in Israel where they have records on the Holocaust, and that's where we discovered more information about what had happened to him.'

Ed Miliband spoke emotionally about explaining to his children what had happened in the war. 

He revealed how he had to explain to his son Daniel why he was lighting a candle for his grandfather who had been murdered in a Nazi extermination camp.

He said: 'I lit the candle and my kids, my eldest son Daniel said to me "what's that for?" and he's five so it's hard to explain. 

'I explained it was my grandfather who I didn't meet and who died at a very young age.'

Mr Miliband said the experience of his family had made him realise both the horror and hope in people's treatment of Jews.

'It's awful and it makes me feel incredibly lucky. There's horror and there's hope, because it's also the case that many members of my family were saved because they were Jews who were hidden by decent people.

[There's another story, which is that there were 17 members of my family who were sheltered in a Belgian village – that's on my father's side – and it was only because of the decent people in that village who helped them.

'So I think this year and at all times, it's right to remember the horror, but it's also right to remember the hope and sense of optimism of what decent people did to save Jews.'

Mr Miliband's remarks come as about 300 Auschwitz survivors gathered at the site of the former Nazi death camp to mark the 70th anniversary of its liberation.

The commemoration will be held at the site in southern Poland where 1.1 million people, the vast majority Jews, were killed between 1940 and 1945.

It is expected to be the last major anniversary event that survivors are able to attend in considerable numbers.

Heads of state and representatives from wartime Allies will also be present.

Events include the laying of a wreath, a church service, and the lighting of candles at a memorial in the former death camp of Birkenau, which was part of the Auschwitz complex.

Auschwitz-Birkenau was liberated by the Red Army of the Soviet Union on 27 January 1945. It opened as a museum in 1947.
