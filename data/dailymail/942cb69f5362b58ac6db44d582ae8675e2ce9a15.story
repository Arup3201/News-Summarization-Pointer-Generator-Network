More than 50 billion apps have been downloaded from Apple's App Store - a figure which would roughly equate to around seven apps for every person on the planet.

Customers now download around 800 per second, or more than two billion each month, the California-based firm said.

Apple announced the milestone in a message to customers on its website.

More than 50 billion apps have been downloaded from Apple's App Store since it opened in July 2008. The 50 billionth app was downloaded by Brandon Ashmore from Ohio and it was word game Say The Same Thing. He won a £6,500 ($10,000) gift card from Apple

The 50 billionth app downloaded from the Apple App Store wasword game, Say The Same Thing.

The app was developed by Space Inch and the band OK Go.

You start by entering a random word and then you and a contestant guess a word that connects those two.

The aim is to repeat with each new pair of words until you Say the Same Thing.

It read: '50 billion app downloads. It couldn't have happened without you.'

The 50 billionth app was downloaded by Brandon Ashmore from Ohio, Apple said.

He was awarded a £6,550 ($10,000) App Store giftcard after downloading the word game Say The Same Thing.

Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of internet software and services, said: 'Apple would like to thank our incredible customers and developers for topping 50 billion apps downloaded.

'We're absolutely floored to cross this milestone in less than five years.'

The App Store opened in July 2008 with 500 apps.

This figure now stands at more than 850,000.

Richard
Dodd, of the British Retail Consortium, said: 'This is a really sharp 
illustration of how rapidly the ways in which customers are choosing to 
shop and the things that they are shopping for are developing.

Since the Apple App Store launched in July 2008 there have been 50 billion downloads. Over 800 apps are downloaded per second. The Top paid-for and free apps are pictured. Whatsapp is the top all-time paid app, while Facebook tops the free list

'Certainly our research shows that shopping via mobile devices is the fastest growing part of retail and digital products are a very big growth area. But it is still the case that 90% of retail spending still happens in stores.'

Last week Candy Crush Saga became the world's most popular game, overtaking Angry Birds for the first time.

It was number one on the Apple App Store, as well as on Google's Play Store and Facebook.

The match-three game's success has helped London-based developer King 
to become the world's 
most popular social gaming firm.

King
now has more than 66 million players worldwide, with more than 15 
million of those playing Candy Crush on Facebook on a daily basis.
