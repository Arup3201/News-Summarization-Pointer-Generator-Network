Town Hall chiefs have banned staff from using the term ‘the elderly’ and suggested ‘older people’ as an alternative.

According to Respect, a 31-page booklet handed out to 5,000 employees at Denbighshire County Council in North Wales, the word elderly is an ‘unacceptable’ phrase.

Similarly, an office is not manned but staffed, dinner ladies should be referred to as catering staff, workmen are workers, headmaster is head teacher, chairman is chairperson and a child or youngster is a younger person.

Politically incorrect: 'Older people' have replaced the elderly in Denbighshire, North Wales (right)

The booklet, produced in Welsh and English, told staff: ‘We should not make assumptions based on someone's age.

'Being older in the UK carries views of being worn out and of little use, it is also used as a term of abuse.

'Youth can be seen as representing inexperience and unreliability.'

It added: 'The terms
 love, dear, pet may be considered offensive by some people, 
particularly women and should not be used.

'We should always consider whether it is 
necessary or appropriate to use labels to describe people and we must be
 careful not to patronise people by undermining their individuality.

National stereotypes: Staff are told to avoid works like 'Jock' for Scottish. The guide says labels should be avoided and adds: 'We must be careful not to patronise people by undermining their individuality'

'Don't say "some of my friends are gay," "you're just like one of the 
lads," "I remember when I was young" or "you might not want to do that 
at your age".

Also banned are Paddy or 
Mick for Irish, Jock for Scots and Taff for Welsh.

And instead of saying Christian name, staff should say 'first name' or forename.

Robert Oxley of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Denbighshire council need to waste less time and less taxpayers’ money producing bureaucratic garbage and instead focus on providing services that residents and the elderly rely on... rather than this ridiculous taxpayer-funded pointless pontificating.’
