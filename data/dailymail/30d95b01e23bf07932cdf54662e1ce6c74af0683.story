A small chihuahua that was rescued off the California highway has been reunited with its owners.

California Highway Patrol in Contra Costa tweeted a photo last Friday of an officer trying to get the dog off the I-680 highway median.

Two little girls and their dad have now picked up their lost Chihuahua named Charm (aka 'Freeway') and taken her home.

The dog had escaped from the family’s backyard and somehow survived crossing the nearby three-lane highway.

Happy ending: The young lady who is very happy to have her dog, Charm, back alongside Animal Services Officer Andrew Tara

Our best friend: Two little girls are reunited with Charm (aka Freeway). They had searched for their lost pet for days and posted messages on Instagram

Scared: The pooch was reportedly frightened and taken to animal control

Nobody knew at the time where the dog came from — whether she had been abandoned or escaped from her owners.

Contra Costa Animal Services took the dog into their care at their Martinez shelter, saying that she would be put up for adoption if nobody claimed her

The reunion was very sweet affair for everyone involved. Charm appeared to be exceptionally happy to see her family once again.

The pooch had escaped from her 
backyard near Hwy 680 and amazingly survived a frightening dash dash across several
 lanes of traffic before jumping onto the median where she was found.

A
 California Highway Patrol officer tweeted the now famous photo of his partner enticing Charm 
with a protein bar.

Animal Services Officer Andrew Tara carefully picked her up and transported her to a shelter 
in Martinez.

Our heroes: Charm is now safe with her family, and the two girls drew a picture to thank the agency and the police officer who helped rescue their pet.

Split personality: In the drawing, the dog has two food bowls: one that says Charm and one that says Freeway

Never let go: It was an emotional and teary reunion as the girls  were reunited with Charm after a week apart

Where she belongs: Since Charm had not been microchipped, it was believed she was either a stray or abandoned, but in fact, the dog¿s family was heartbroken when she disappeared. The two little girls had been posting photos of their dog on Instagram for days looking for help

Scared: Charm was said to be frightened when she was initially found but by Mothers Day she had calmed down somewhat

Dynamic duo: One officer lured the frightened dog using a piece of a protein bar. The other officer snapped a photo that soon began to tug at heartstrings across the Internet

The girls had been posting Instagram photos of their lost 
dog for days and had been looking for her since she escaped from their backyard.Since Charm had not been microchipped, it was believed she was either a stray or abandoned, but in fact, the dog’s family was heartbroken when she disappeared.

The two little girls thanked Officer Tara and drew a picture which
 included Charm and twofood bowls: one that said Charm and the other 
that said Freeway.

'We are ALL very happy for the family, who 
have learned a very valuable and expensive lesson in pet licensing, 
microchipping, spaying, good fencing, and the power of social media!' said the Contra Costa Animal Shelter in a statement.

The story began on Saturday after a tweet by the Contra Costa patrol division said that the dog had been found in the middle of the road.

CHP officer Alex Edmond responded after police received two calls about the chihuahua.

'We attempted to coax it, we could tell it was very frightened, it was shaking - we were able to pet it a little bit, but other than that we could tell it was not happy,' Edmon said.

The dog did not respond to his offer of trail mix and was eventually lured by a protein bar.

If Charm the chihuahua had not been picked up, she would likely have been adopted by an eager new owner

Driving the message home: Now that the little Chihuahua's story has had a happy ending, the agency wants to raise awareness about the other homeless shelter dogs waiting for adoption

The chihuahua also seemed to enjoy herself on Mother's Day, according to a Sunday Facebook announcement.

She 'is starting to relax and come out of her shell,' it said. 'Today on Mother's day [sic], two of our wonderful kennel technicians spent their lunch socializing her and helping her overcome her fear.'

Now that the little Chihuahua's story has had a happy ending, the agency wants to raise awareness about the other homeless shelter dogs waiting for adoption.

'They haven't had the media attention this little Chihuahua has had, but they are just as deserving,' the agency said.
