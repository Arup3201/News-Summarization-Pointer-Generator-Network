Pictures of Nigel Farage drinking in pubs with mystery women on his arm is part of what makes Britain great, Gordon Brown claimed today as he attacked UKIP for fuelling fears about globalisation.

The former Prime Minister mocked Mr Farage’s image as a drinking, womanising populist who fuels fears about globalisation.

Mr Brown insisted the rise of UKIP – topping the European elections last month – was not the result of public anger over immigration or Europe, but fears about the ‘juggernaut’ of global change and Britain’s place in the world.

The Labour party is divided about how to respond to the threat from UKIP after seeing support switch in heartland working class seats in the north.

Work and pensions spokesman Rachel Reeves warned that blue-collar supporters felt UKIP understood their fears better while Yvette Cooper insisted: ‘We can’t imitate UKIP, we have got to take them on.’ 

But despite being part of the Labour government which opened the doors to eastern Europe and handed more powers to Brussels, Mr Brown claimed Labour had to make the case for opening up the British economy to rest of the world.

And he ridiculed Mr Farage, who has often been pictured drinking in pubs and last week faced questions after returning to his hotel at a tourism conference in Malta at 4am with an attractive  woman.

Mr Farage dismissed allegations of inappropriate behaviour as ‘fluff and nonsense’, saying: ‘I didn’t go to bed with her.’

Speaking at press gallery lunch in Parliament, Mr Brown said: ‘Britain cannot be Britain without seeing a photograph of Nigel Farage with a pint in his hand and a mystery woman lady in the other hand.’

He went on: ‘Britain cannot be Britain these days, a new permanent fixture by the way, without the Liberals coming in sixth place.

‘Britain cannot be Britain unless at some point you have a Scottish as well as welsh or northern Irish prime minister and not simply English Prime Minister.

Mr Brown joked that part of Britain was Nigel Farage's love of drinking and Nick Clegg's Lib Dems now finishing sixth in elections, after woeful results in the European elections and Newark by-election

‘Britain cannot be Britain without Scotland being part of the United Kingdom and without Scotland Britain will not be Britain. We rub together. Scottish assertiveness, sometimes English indifference.

‘There is a difference, and there is aggression but Scotland and Britain go together and I don’t want to see a future where the four nations of this United Kingdom at a time when the world is becoming more integrated, societies are talking about interdependence and when it’s absolutely important that we have co-operation in the future.’

He warned Labour leader Ed Miliband must not respond to UKI with tougher policies on migrant workers or the EU.

Instead Labour must make the case for Britain working more closely with foreign countries.

‘For me this is an issue about global change. People say it’s an issue about immigration and it’s an issue an issue about Europe.

‘But it’s about how we respond, and who gets the benefit from these massive changes, this juggernaut that is taking place as a result of the opening up of the global economy.’

Mr Brown joked that he had been at a meeting at the International Monetary Fund where protestors outside were carrying a banner declaring: ‘Worldwide campaign against globalisation.’

He went on: ‘You know exactly what people meant. People feel that this alien to them. People feel that its unfriendly, people feel that they cannot control the process of change, and it’s about time that we showed that globalisation – that is the big processes of opening up the global economy – has a human face.

‘I frankly thought that when we had the G20 in 2009 and with Barack Obama as President we would be able to do this, we would be able to show that you can manage globalisation in the interests of people.

‘But the retreat from global co-operation in the last few years makes it very difficult.

‘We have got to show for skilled workers, or people worried about skills, people who are worried about their security, people who are on low pay, that there is a future for their children that is more about skills security and decent employment.

‘It seems to me that that is the answer to UKIP as it is the answer to Scottish nationalism.’
