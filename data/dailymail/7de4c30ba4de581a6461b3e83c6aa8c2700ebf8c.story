A young photojournalist was gang raped while her male colleague was tied up and beaten in India's business hub of Mumbai, police said.

The case has brought back bad memories of the December gang rape and death of a young university student in the Indian capital that shocked the country.

The attack took place in an abandoned textile mill in Lower Parel, a gritty former industrial district that is now one of the city's fastest-growing neighbourhoods of luxury apartments, malls and bars.

Composite sketches of the suspects: Police said the victim was on assignment to take pictures of an abandoned textile factory in south Mumbai late yesterday when the five men confronted her

The woman was working on an assignment
with a male colleague to take pictures of the factory last night when 
five men confronted the pair.

After
initially offering to help her get permission to shoot inside the 
building, they became aggressive and accused the male colleague of being
involved in a local crime.

When
he denied any involvement they tied his hands with a belt and took the 
woman to another part of the building compound and took turns raping 
her, said Mumbai's Police Commissioner Satyapal Singh.

The
police chief said officers have already arrested one suspect over the 
attack and he has named and identified the other four.

The woman, 22, is in stable condition in a hospital.

The assault comes amid heightened concerns about sexual violence in India.

The
gang rape and death of the student on a bus in New Delhi in December 
had shaken a country long inured to violence against women and sparked 
protests demanding better protection for women.

In
response, the government passed a new stringent law increasing prison 
terms for rape and making voyeurism, stalking, acid attacks and the 
trafficking of women punishable under criminal law.

The
trials of the four men and one juvenile accused of the December attack 
are expected to conclude within the next three weeks.

The
verdict on the juvenile suspect is set for August 31. Closing arguments
in the trial of the four adult suspects started on Thursday.

The
police have released sketches of the suspects wanted over yesterday's 
attack based on descriptions given by the woman and her colleague, and 
have formed several teams to track them.

Commissioner Singh said the area where the attack took place was very isolated and the men may have been local drug dealers.

The
attack was discussed in India's Parliament, where junior Home Minister 
R.P.N. Singh told lawmakers that the government had asked the state of 
Maharashtra, of which Mumbai is the capital, for a detailed report on 
the attack.

About 1,000 people, including members of several local journalists' associations, gathered this evening in south Mumbai to stage a silent protest. Some wore black armbands, while others carried placards reading 'Stop rape' and 'City of shame'.

In contrast to Delhi, Mumbai has long been considered a safer place for women to travel alone, even at night.

'(Mumbai)
has this sense of security ... but these things make us feel that maybe
we are not really that safe,' said A. L. Sharada, director of 
Population First, an NGO that works on women's rights issues.

'Women
should be able to move freely and take up work. Why should we be 
worrying about something bad happening to us all the time?' Ms Sharada 
added. 

Commissioner Singh 
said the federal government had recommended that the 'harshest' 
punishment be handed down to anyone found guilty in the case.
