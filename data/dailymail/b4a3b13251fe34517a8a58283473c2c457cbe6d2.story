No-one ever said that being a celebrity was a dog's life. But the Battersea Dogs and Cats Home in south London is raising money by auctioning off a dog-walking experience with a whole host of dog-loving celebrities, including supermodel David Gandy, Oscar-winning actor Jeremy Irons and Saturdays singer and style icon Mollie King.

Also getting their collars and leads ready for the exclusive one-on-one outings is Britain's Got Talent's Amanda Holden, adventurer, presenter and animal campaigner Ben Fogle, fashionista and model Daisy Lowe as well dance supremo Ashley Banjo and radio DJ Neil Fox, the proud owner of Battersea dog Bonzo.

However the celebrities with have to get used sharing the limelight with the the real stars of the day, the four-legged friends from Battersea who will be joining in the star-studded walkies, showing off their loveable traits and stealing attention from their dog walkers wherever possible.

Highest bidders in the auction at www.collarsandcoats.org.uk/ebay will win a full half hour with their favourite dog-loving celebrity, and the walks will take place in nearby Battersea Park, close to the iconic south London rescue that has cared for 3.1 million dogs and cats since it was opened in 1860.

The online auction starts today and runs until midnight on Friday 8 November. It is being launched to support the charity’s annual Collars and Coats Gala Ball, a spectacular event bursting with glitz and glamour which raises money to enable Battersea to care for thousands of lost and abandoned dogs and cats. Now in its fifth year, this year’s Hollywood themed event will be hosted by Battersea Ambassadors Amanda Holden and Paul O’Grady.

Holden is looking forward to her walk with some Battersea dogs. She said, 'It is such an honour for me to be supporting Battersea at the Collars and Coats Gala Ball again this year. As a Battersea Ambassador I want to support the charity in any way I can and all the money raised through the auction will help more deserving animals find new loving homes. I am really excited about going on my walkies with a couple of gorgeous Battersea dogs and a lucky winner.'

One of the most popular dog-walking celebrities is a dog himself. Pudsey won Britain's Got Talent last year with his owner Ashleigh Butler, and has since performed for the Queen.

Said Ashleigh: 'Every dog deserves a loving home and Battersea does a fantastic job helping lost and abandoned dogs. Pudsey and I are going to do our bit by taking part in Battersea’s eBay dog walk auction and help raise as much money as we can for homeless dogs. It’s such a fun way to raise awareness of a great cause.'

Fans of television presenter Ben Fogle will love the chance to take a stroll with the adventuror and animal lover, who famously met his wife Marina while they were both walking their dogs in London's Hyde Park.

Said Ben: 'As a dog lover, I whole-heartedly support Battersea’s fantastic work and so it’s an absolute honour to be able to raise much needed funds. The dogs deserve every penny we raise and I’m really looking forward to my walk with a very special rescue pup and an eBay winner.'

Model and fashion designer Daisy Lowe is often photographed walking her dog. Daisy said,  'My dog Monty means the absolute world to me, so to be able to support Battersea in giving a second chance to lost and abandoned dogs is an absolute joy.'

Claire Horton, Battersea’s chief executive said, 'It is such a fantastic auction prize, with so many wonderful famous faces getting involved and showing their love for our four-legged friends. It’s what walkies dreams are made of and best of all, all money raised will help the thousands of homeless dogs, and cats, we care for every year.'
