After being slapped with hefty airline fines in the past, savvy travellers are embracing mobile devices to check in for flights.

A new report by travel search engine Kayak has found that two in five passengers (42 per cent) have incurred an average of £51 in airline charges because of issues with traditional paper travel documents.

As a result, almost a third (32 per cent) are now choosing to ditch printed boarding passes in favour of smart devices and airline apps.

There's an app for that: Almost a third of passengers would prefer to check in for flights using mobile devices

The most common issue which affected 14 per cent of passengers was lost boarding passes, followed by the 12 per cent with forgetting to print their boarding passes altogether.

These problems are followed by the 11 per cent of people who didn’t have the opportunity or means to do so. For six per cent of people, the print quality of their self-printed boarding pass hindered their journey.

Currently several budget airlines charge for the replacement of documents, with Ryanair demanding as much as £15 if you arrive at the airport without your printed check in documents, and £70 for checking in at the airport. 

Some 57 per cent of travellers believe that airlines fines over forgotten or lost boarding passes are unfair.

Of those surveyed, 44 per cent said they prefer digital check-in as they worry about forgetting a printed boarding pass. 

Similarly, 35 per cent say that they would be more likely to lose a printed copy of a boarding pass than their smart device.

For 38 per cent of travellers, digital check in is simply more convenient than the hassle of printing, and with 23 per cent of regular travellers admitting to not owning a printer, it isn’t surprising. For a further third (36 per cent) of people, environmental concerns lead them to prefer paperless check in methods.

The desire to move away from traditional printed airport check in methods entirely towards digital only would be welcomed by 36 per cent of travellers.

The digital revolution doesn't stop once you've boarded the flight. 29 per cent of guests would rather check in to their hotel using their smart phone too. 

Loella Pehrsson, Regional Managing Director UK, Ireland & the Nordics of Kayak said: 'In today’s fast-paced world remembering to print and keep track of boarding passes and reservations can be an inconvenience to travellers, especially when they have a device in their pocket which can do the job for them.

'Consumers rely on their smart devices in every area of their lives and travelling is no different.'

The report by polled 1,000 travellers who make more than two return flights a year.
