And with modern technology, appearance-altering digital techniques in magazines and online has become all too commonplace.

The fascinating insight into the editing process for a L'Oreal Garnier advert shows precisely the alterations that take place - from the model's appearance through to tweaks made to the background set.

From contrasting shadows to added brightening and lighting effects, it's clear that Brueckl is paying attention to all the most minuscule details while still keeping the ad as natural as possible.

Before and after... Can you spot all the minuscule differences corrected by Andreas?

In the video description the Munich and Instanbul-based creative says: 'In this breakdown, I show some of my techniques that I use for beauty commercials. I recorded the monitor output and edited the 30 minute real-time grading down to a three minute clip.

'To be honest, I don't show much of the beauty retouching and skin grading. The model has very nice skin and with the help of Garnier, it was not much work for me'
