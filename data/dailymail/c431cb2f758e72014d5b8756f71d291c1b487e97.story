A new mobile home that has a movable interior wall is set to revolutionise the humble caravan holiday.

The Concept Van measures just 30ft by 13ft, but the cutting-edge design allows the same area to be used for different functions at different times.

During the day, the sliding bedroom wall is pushed back, freeing up an extra 60sqft of room to create an impressive open-plan living space that has room for a 10-seater dining table.

It has been designed by holiday home makers ABI based in Beverley, East Yorks, and has gone on show at the Hoburne Holiday Park in New Milton, Hampshire

At night, the wall can be moved back to provide space for a foldaway double bed.

On the other side of the wall there are two concealed, single bunk beds that can be folded down when the wall has been pulled back.

With fixed triple bunk beds on one end of the caravan and a sofa in the lounge doubling as a bed, what should be a six berth mobile home becomes one for ten people.

The only permanent room that doesn't change in size is the bathroom and toilet.

It doesn't have a price as it has not gone on sale yet.

At night, the wall comes out and with it a foldaway bed to form a comfortable double bedroom

It will also mean holiday parks will have more space available on site to fit more caravans as they can do away with much bigger, four bed units for 10 people

Although it is just a prototype, the clever caravan is tipped to be the future of 'staycation' holidays.

Richard Jones, a director at ABI, said: 'We wanted to design a caravan that utilises the space in a different way.

'In a normal caravan, a bedroom is a bedroom 24 hours a day. But for 16 hours it is a 10ft by 13ft of space that is not is use.

With fixed triple bunk beds on one end of the caravan and a sofa in the lounge doubling as a bed, what should be a six berth mobile home becomes one for nine people

'If you close the bedroom up when it is not being used you can use that space for a different purpose.

'We have used the same sort of technology that a large document filing storage unit uses to be able to move a central wall to open and close the bedroom space when it is needed.

'We have come up with a genius van that has space for nine holiday makers to sleep, dine, relax or entertain themselves, all in a holiday home that measures only 30ft x 13ft.

Behind the main bedroom are two concealed, single bunk beds that fold down. There are also three fixed bunk beds at one end of the caravan

'The key to the design is using the same space for different functions at different times. 

'To allow for this we added pull down beds, a triple bunk bed, an extendable dining table that packs away when not in use, kitchen work-tops hidden in drawers, a cinema screen that drops down from the ceiling and walls that move at the push of a button.

'We have received some great feedback and can't wait to start encapsulating the ideas into our collections over the coming years.'
