Heard the one about the penguin that walks into a bar?

No? Neither had we until we saw this hilarious video showing an African penguin strolling around a beach restaurant after taking a break from his colony near Capetown, South Africa.

The brazen bird was captured on camera wandering around the popular guesthouse before eventually being shooed out after overstaying his welcome.

The bold bird manages to evade staff at the Boulders Beach Lodge and Restaurant, near Cape Town, to the delight of guests

The unexpected visitor was an African Penguin, one of 112,000 of the birds alive in the world

The animal, also known as a Jackass penguin due to its donkey-like call, is part of the renowned Boulders Beach African Penguin Colony, one of many groups that live on the country's southern coasts.

Guests at the the Boulders Beach Lodge and Restaurant can be heard in hysterics as the bird cleverly evades staff by waddling in a circle around a coffee table. 

At one point the curious penguin stops in his tracks, sparking a stand-off with gawping members of staff at the guest-house, situated near Simon's Town, south of Cape Town.

Checking out: Staff finally manage to push the penguin back outside after a little gentle coaxing with a broom

In one last effort to stay in the restaurant, the penguin attempts to dart under a different table but this time is eventually shown the door after some gentle coaxing with a broom.

The unexpected guest is part of a 3,000-strong colony that live just metres from the resort, with some even nesting in the hotel's garden, to the delight of guests. 

Annie Van Heerden, 37, manager of the guesthouse and restaurant, said: 'In season, we get them coming in a lot and all the guests love taking pictures of them.'

The penguin colony lives 70 metres from the Boulders Beach Lodge and Restaurant, with some even nesting in the garden

'They're friendly animals, unless you give them a fright, but sometimes it's quite hard to get them out. We have about three nests in the grounds of the lodge.

'The rest of the colony lives about 70 metres away by the beach. They're very popular with people who stay here, although they're pretty noisy at night time.'
