Three thugs high on drink and drugs have been jailed after robbing two men in Salford within minutes of each other.

Ballet master Dominic Antonucci, 39, was walking through Ordsall Park at 11am on Saturday, February 1 ahead of a matinee performance of The Prince of the Pagodas at the Lowry Theatre when he was attacked Manchester Crown Court heard.

Mr Antonucci, who dances with Birmingham Royal Ballet, was pulling his suitcase and wearing a rucksack when he was set upon by William Paine, 23, Liam Johnson, 18, and Jerome Tue, 18.

Mr Antonucci was punched in the face and had a bottle smashed over his head before going to the ground where he was kicked and punched.

He cried out for help and passers-by came over as the three thugs walked away in a ‘casual manner’ with his suitcase. It was later found dumped.

Mr Antonucci was taken to Salford Royal where he was treated but still suffers from a serious injury to his left eye.

In a victim impact statement read to the court Mr Antonucci said he is still having problems with his eye and had been unable to work for two months after the robbery. However, he said that bore no ill-will towards his attackers.

Mr Antonucci a father of one who was bullied at school because of his love of ballet, suffered serious neck and head injuries as well as damaged teeth and he needed surgery to repair a damaged retina in his left eye. He later had to wear an eye patch and was unable to perform for eight weeks and now feels nervous whenever he goes out.

In a statement he said: ‘As someone who has worked in pretty rough schools teaching dance I feel for them and I hope they can get themselves sorted out. I don’t have any feelings of revenge.

‘I’m just pleased there’s no lasting effects and I’m back at work. It was a sickening attack and I’m thrilled it’s all over. It saved a lot of trouble and heartache for everyone that they all pleaded guilty. That was a big comfort.

‘Everything happened so fast so it’s really lucky there were witnesses. It was half way over before I knew what was going on so I would not have been much of a help. My daughter is 15 and she was very upset to see my injuries and what happened.

‘We’re just relieved it’s over and we can move on with our lives. It was a traumatic experience. It has taken me a long time to feel comfortable on the streets again. I was a bit afraid of even a pigeon flying nearby. It does feel like I can close the book on it.

‘It was the frustration at having to see them unzip my suitcase and go through it. My front teeth were badly damaged and I am still receiving treatment with an estimated cost of £900.

‘I have a scratch to the left cornea which has meant five different hospital visits. That’s had the most impact on my daily life as I have been unable to work for 7 to 8 weeks and had to wear an eye patch and dark glasses. Even now I’m quite nervous when out and it’s difficult because I’m usually a confident guy.’

Within minutes the three muggers had struck again, this time attacking John Owen, 52, a postman on his delivery round.

One of the three shouted: ‘Let’s do him. lads!’ and he was then subjected to a ‘frenzied’ attack, being kicked and punched while curled up in a ball before his attackers left with his postbag.

Mr Owen, a postman for 11 years, has felt unable to go out on rounds again following the attack, suffers anxiety attacks and his victim impact statement said that the robbery had a ‘massive effect’ on his personality.

‘[They] don’t realise the after effect these incidents have on people,’ he told the court.

Police were called and all three were arrested after fleeing the scene of the attack.

Paine, Johnson and Tue all from Salford admitted two counts of robbery at an earlier hearing.

Paine, a father-of-two, had numerous previous convictions, as did Johnson, including a conviction aged 13 for a robbery involving a knife. Tue had never been in trouble before.

The court heard all three had been drinking and taking cocaine at an all-night party and could remember little if anything of the robberies.

Jailing Paine and Johnson, Recorder Terence Rigby told them: ‘This is not just a tragedy for you but a tragedy for your family and friends and it is one you have brought upon them. My judgement is that each of these offences was very if not the most serious of robberies - made the more serious by the fact there were two robberies on two victims within a few minutes of each other.

‘I have no doubt drink and drugs played a part in what you did but the fact of the matter is it doesn’t matter to him whether you were drunk or had been taking cocaine or anything else.

‘What matters to him is that he was set upon and violently assaulted. I think that this is not a tragedy for you but it is a tragedy for your family and friends and one that you have brought on them and I hope you all finally see sense.’

Defending father-of-two Paine, Hunter Gray said: ‘He has not drunk alcohol since the offences. No real forethought went into this.’

For Johnson, Robert Kearney: ‘His memory of the incident is non-existent. It was a brave thing to enter his plea. A guilty plea is the ultimate expression of remorse. He has GCSEs and has qualified in football coaching. It lacked sophistication. A hooded top is the uniform of youth not a form of disguise.’

Paine and Jones were each jailed for two years and Tue got 16 months. All were told pay a £100 victim surcharge.
