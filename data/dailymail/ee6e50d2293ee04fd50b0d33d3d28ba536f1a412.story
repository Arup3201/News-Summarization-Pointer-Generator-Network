Traces of accelerant have been found at the site of a convenience store explosion that claimed the lives of three people, including a 12-month-old baby and his mother.  

Senior police revealed the blast was being treated as a suspected arson attack after traces of petrol were uncovered at the Darling Street store in Rozelle after it exploded and burnt to the ground last Thursday, Nine News reports.

Police have not yet confirmed if the blaze will be treated as a murder investigation.

Investigators have ruled out the involvement of a silver car seen racing from the scene by a witness, just moments after the fire erupted.

The owner of the Rozelle convenience store Adeel Khan was interviewed by police from his bed in the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital at the weekend.

Mr Khan, 44, remains in a serious condition after rescue crews found him pinned under a fridge in the wreckage.

Police said they will need to re-interview him once his condition improves. It is not clear why the 44-year-old was in the store at 4am when the fire broke out. 

The surrounding tenants, Chris Noble, 27, Bianka O’Brien, 31, and her one-year-old son Jude, all died as a result of the blast.

Mr Khan's wife told Nine News she was concerned about media reports insinuating her husband was a suspect in the investigation.

'Just because he is a survivor doesn't mean he has done anything wrong,' she said.

Friends and family have paid tribute to Chris Noble, 27, who also lost is life in the explosion in Sydney's inner west suburb of Rozelle

Mrs O'Brien's husband John is said to have left his home less than an hour before flames engulfed his home located above a shop on Darling Street.

He released a statement on Sunday that paid tribute to his late wife who he said was much more than the love of his life, and his baby boy Jude, who Mr O'Brien described as the perfect child.

'On Thursday morning I lost my beloved wife, Bianka, and our baby Jude,' the statement began.

'Bianka was an inspiration to all who knew her – she was loyal, caring and absolutely loved life. People gravitated towards her because of her beautiful and warm personality.

'Bianka and I were together for eight years, married for two, and to say she was the love of my life is an understatement', Mr O'Brien wrote.

'She was an exceptional person, a wonderful wife and an even better mother. This week Bianka was due to finish up her part-time work so she could move into the next phase of her life and fulfil her dream of caring for our boy full time.

'That brings me to my son, Jude, who I love with all my heart. By far the proudest moment of my life was becoming a father. He was a perfect baby and never stopped smiling', the statement continued.

'Jude had just started to walk and was only just discovering the world around him. Everything was exciting to him and he was just a joy to be around.

'He made everyone smile,' Mr O'Brien continued.

The message ended with a heartfelt sentiment for the family of Chris Noble, a neighbour also killed in the blaze.

'Finally, I would like to extend my sympathy to the family of Chris Noble and everyone else who has been affected by this.'

On Thursday morning I lost my beloved wife, Bianka, and our baby Jude.

Bianka was an inspiration to all who knew her – she was loyal, caring and absolutely loved life. People gravitated towards her because of her beautiful and warm personality.

Bianka and I were together for eight years, married for two, and to say she was the love of my life is an understatement.

I can’t believe how quickly those eight years have flown by but they have definitely been the best years of my life.

I know I was truly loved by her and the feeling was entirely mutual.

She was an exceptional person, a wonderful wife and an even better mother. This week Bianka was due to finish up her part-time work so she could move into the next phase of her life and fulfil her dream of caring for our boy full time.

Being a mother made her happy and she was a natural at it.

That brings me to my son, Jude, who I love with all my heart. By far the proudest moment of my life was becoming a father. He was a perfect baby and never stopped smiling.

Jude had just started to walk and was only just discovering the world around him. Everything was exciting to him and he was just a joy to be around.

He made everyone smile.

On behalf of Bianka’s father, Bill, and myself I would like to thank the community for the many well-wishes, flowers and phone calls we have received.

The events of the past few days have been devastating, but we have been overwhelmed by the response and support from the community.

I would also like to thank the police and other emergency services who have been by our side and continue to support us.

Finally, I would like to extend my sympathy to the family of Chris Noble and everyone else who has been affected by this.

We now ask that the media and public continue to respect our privacy during this time.

On Sunday, a resident who survived the convenience store blaze that claimed the lives of three of his neighbours has spoken about how their deaths have weighed heavily on him.

Anthony Carroll, 49, said he has spent much time since the tragedy wondering if Bianka and Jude O'Brien could have been saved from the devastating fire if he had known they were in the building.

'Had the fire crews known about the access, could they have got to Bianka and the baby?' he told Sydney Morning Herald.

'That's something I don't know. It has sat heavily with me.'

The convenience store went up in flames about 4am on Thursday morning and an explosion was heard by residents who lived about 1km away from the scene

Mr Carroll jumped from his burning apartment following the explosion at the convenience store and said he knew the owner of the store, Adeel Khan, who was hospitalised after the blaze.

He said there were no indicators to suggest the fire could have been part of an 'insurance job' and Mr Carroll also revealed he visited the store most days.

'I saw him on a daily basis. His wife was there in the afternoon and they were talking about the stock. The shop was always fully stocked. If you have got financial problems where are you going to get the money from to keep the shop full?' Mr Carroll said, and also described the owner as a 'family man'.

It follows Mr Noble's friends and family sharing special memories of the 27-year-old on Saturday, commemorating him as a 'great guy' with 'real character'.

Shaken by the horrific loss of a community member, player and friend, Pythons coach Graham Rice, paid tribute to Noble at his commemoration service on Saturday evening, by dedicating a special jersey in memory of the talented sportsman, ABC reported.

'He just loved his mates in Canowindra and he just wanted to come back and play with them,' Mr Rice said.

On Friday, the mother of Mr Noble tearfully remembered her son as a 'beautiful', athletic and sociable young man who loved watches.

Mum Liz, dad Ross and sister Kate fronted the media to pay tribute to their son and brother Chris Noble from Canowindra.

Mr Noble's sister Kate wiped away tears as mum Liz told reporters: 'We lost our beautiful boy yesterday... He should have been safe in bed'.
