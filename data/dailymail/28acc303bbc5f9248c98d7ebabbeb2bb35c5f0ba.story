Diego Costa once more highlighted how deadly he can be as the Chelsea striker bagged a brace against Everton - but he also showed the darker side of his game at Goodison Park.

The £32million summer signing continued his remarkable run of form by netting twice - the first after 34 seconds and the second in the 90th minute - to make it four goals in just three Premier League appearances.

Yet Costa was also involved in a series of heated incidents on the pitch during Chelsea's 6-3 victory.

Point to make: Tim Howard takes hold of Costa to let his feelings know after the own goal during a mad game

The 25-year-old squared up to both Seamus Coleman and Tim Howard, as well as Everton defender Sylvain Distin. He was also booked during the high-scoring encounter.

Costa and Coleman were warned by the referee for pushing and shoving, but the Spanish international continued even after the talking-to and was cautioned for it. 

But that just riled Costa even more. After Coleman had put into his own goal, Costa picked the ball out of the net and ran past Coleman, screaming and gloating in the Irishman's face.

The striker was then confronted by Everton 'keeper Howard, who squared up to him and was cautioned for the incident. 

And Everton manager Roberto Martinez revealed that some of his players had complained about Costa's behaviour during the game.

Opener: Diego Costa scored Chelsea's first goal after just 34 seconds at Goodison Park on Saturday

He said: 'There is a real professionalism in the Premier League and I can understand why the players were unhappy (with Costa).' 

Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho defended the actions of his player, however. 

He said: 'To be chasing cards to a player who once more had good behaviour and was just here to play football is disappointing.

'At the end of the story Diego is maybe the best player in the Premier League in the first three matches and he has two yellow cards; one against Burnley where he didn't simulate it was a penalty and today when everyone was chasing him to get him in trouble. That is disappointing.' 

Costa is a wonderful footballer and also a combustive character.

One thing is for certain, there will never a dull moment with the £32m striker on the field.
