Are we alone in the universe? We could be closer to finding out.

British astronomers are joining forces to hunt for ET – or at least signs of his existence.

Scientists from 11 institutions, including the renowned Jodrell Bank observatory, have launched a network that will help those working in different fields of research to share their expertise.

Telescopes will listen in for radio and light ‘broadcasts’ beamed out by TVs, radios, satellites, radar and lasers from other worlds.

And should a message from little green men be intercepted, we might be ready to reply. 

Communications experts more used to working on intelligence of chimpanzees and dolphins are tackling how to decode any messages and put together a response.

The network, which is being coordinated by Dr Alan Penny, of the University of St Andrews, was officially launched today at the National Astronomy Meeting, organised by the Royal Astronomical Society, at St Andrews, Scotland.

The UK SETI Research Network, or UKSRN, will bolster Britain’s long-running involvement in the US-based, Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence, or SETI, project.

Dr Penny said that the interception of light and radio signals that are wholly artificial and could not be made by nature would be proof that we are not alone.

He said: ‘If ET fired a powerful laser through a big optical telescope to send a signal or announce their existence, those pulses could be detected over many thousands of light years.

‘It's the same with the radio search. we don't know if they are emitting signals, but if they were then we have the equipment to pick them up. We need to get more time on telescopes for the project and then we'll get a flood of data.

‘At the moment if we detected a signal that was unambiguously artificial that would be it. You wouldn't need to understand the message - its nature would tell us that we are not alone.

‘Then again once you've found it then you can look more closely to see if there is a message. If it looks as though there is, then GCHQ can get going and try to decode it.’

Others believe that that a new level of code-breaking will be required.

Dr John Elliott, an expert in human and animal communication from Leeds Metropolitan University, said: ‘Standard decipherment and decryption techniques used by the military and security agencies are not going to help much. 

Some scientists argue that if ET has the technology to cross space to reach us, any defences we have will be all but useless. Stephen Hawking (pictured) has warned that aliens may plunder Earth for its resources. But not everyone is convinced that the threat is real

‘To put the challenge into context, we still have scripts from antiquity that have remained undeciphered over hundreds of years, despite many serious attempts.’

However, scientists are divided about whether we should be should advertise our presence by responding to any message.

Some say that if we alert hostile aliens to our existence we risk an invasion that could lead to the end of life on Earth.

Spaceships: Stevie Nicks believes she saw alien life while living in Arizona

It is an admission that might not have been too surprising if she were still hooked on drink and drugs.

But Stevie Nicks had given up both at the time she claims to have seen alien spaceships. 

The Fleetwood Mac singer says she made her sightings when she was living in Phoenix, Arizona.

Miss Nicks, 65, said: ‘I lived for a while underneath the famous Camelback Mountain in Phoenix and I would sit outside and see white floating objects – a lot of them obviously aeroplanes – up in the sky.

'I used to call it the Space Highway because there are just spaceships being reported in that area all the time up there.

‘It’s just like an episode of X Files sometimes. I’m sure that somewhere within the real aeroplanes I saw alien spaceships too.

‘It was that creepy. I’d given up alcohol, and drugs, so seeing little green men in spaceships probably wasn’t a good idea for me.’

Miss Nicks, who says she feels healthier than she has in 30 years, also believes that she was a Jewish woman in a concentration camp in a previous life.

Fleetwood Mac’s world tour arrives in the UK in September.

The new network will capitalise on existing funding for space projects, although some extra cash may be needed for new research

Professor Ian Crawford, of Birkbeck, University of London, told the conference that any aliens ‘would have made themselves known by now’.

The network will capitalise on existing funding for space projects, although some extra cash may be needed for new research.

Dr Robert Massey, of the Royal Astronomical Society, said: ‘If we found even one civilisation elsewhere, it would be an entirely sensational result.

‘It is just so interesting that it would be a shame not to do it just a little bit because the consequences could be extraordinary.’
