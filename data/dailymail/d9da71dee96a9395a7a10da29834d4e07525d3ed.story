Rory McIIroy has put a very public dig from his former fiancee Caroline Wozniacki behind him by setting himself up to win The Open.

Danish Wozniacki, though, has proved her credentials as well, by beating Italian Roberta Vinci in straight sets to win the Istanbul Cup on Sunday.

McIlroy is tantelisingly close to victory at Hoylake and held a six-shot lead over Rickie Fowler on Sunday morning - a margin no-one has ever blown in the competition before.

Nearly: Rory McIlroy is in pole position to win The Open Championship at Hoylake

Almost: Going into the final round McIlroy was in pole position with a six-shot lead over Rickie Fowler

Her own win: Wozniacki faced Roberta Vinci in the Istanbul Cup final but managed to get the victory

Regret: Wozniacki deleted her public dig at McIlroy but got on with her job in the Istanbul Cup final

Celebration: Wozniacki of Denmark holds the Istanbul Cup trophy up after beating Vinci of Italy

Cheeky: Caroline Wozniacki posted this picture, saying she was wearing heels for the first time in three years

Wozniacki trolled the 5ft 8in McIlroy by posting a photograph of herself wearing a pair of high heels in Istanbul.

With it, she wrote: 'Out and about in Istanbul. It's been three years since I have worn high heels on a normal day out. #feelsgood #looksgood #shopping #highheels #sun'

She later deleted the post on Instagram.

It didn't seem to bother McIlroy in his first round on Friday, as he hit a second consecutive 66 at the Open to go four clear before extending that lead on Saturday.

Wozniacki, who dated McIlroy for three years before they called off their engagement in May, is  5ft 10in while the Northern Irishman is 5ft 8in.

Difference: Wozniacki was slightly taller than McIlroy in heels (left) so she wore flat shoes (right) mainly

Not used to heels? Shortly after the stiletto photo she posted this photo of herself being pampered

Leading: McIlroy made a fine start to The Open and was seen with model Nadia Forde earlier this month
