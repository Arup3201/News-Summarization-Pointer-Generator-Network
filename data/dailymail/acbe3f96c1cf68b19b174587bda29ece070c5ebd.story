A woman has described the moment she thought she was going to be murdered when a six foot seven inch thug took her hostage at knifepoint for four hours. 

Maria Carvalho, 25, was just weeks from giving birth when Russell Ireland broke into her home in Ipswich, Suffolk, while attempting to hide after mistakenly thinking he had killed a teenage boy.

Last Friday Ireland, 29, was jailed for seven years at Ipswich Crown Court after he admitted three offences of false imprisonment, making a threat to kill, and assaulting a 16-year-old youth.

Ms Carvalho said she had been at home with her sister Maria, 28, and her partner Angelo Paiva, 32, when they heard someone entering their property through the back door.

The Portugal-born couple initially thought it was their landlord arriving, but were shocked when Ireland walked into the room carrying a knife.

Appearing agitated, Ireland told the group he needed to lie low after attacking a 16-year-old youth at the nearby Chequers Hotel, and then pulled out a knife and threatened to stab Mr Paiva.

After seizing the couple's phones, Ireland seemed to calm down and insisted on watching films with the group, with Mr Paiva even making him a sandwich and giving him something to drink.

Speaking about their ordeal last October, Ms Carvalho said: 'It was horrible... I was just sitting on the sofa looking at movies on the television and not looking at him at all.'

'I had a pillow in front of my belly because of my unborn baby. It was just terrible...I feared for my life. I was very frightened because he was big and had a knife.'

She added: 'I felt he could lose his mind and do something... 'He was calm sometimes, but when he was on the phone [to the police] he just snapped.'

After making a phone call to his aunt, armed police arrived at the phone - at which point Ireland became agitated again.

Describing the incident as 'quite weird', Mr Paiva said: 'He became aggressive when police came here. He broke the baby’s chair and tossed it against the door. He started to become unstable. He said he didn’t like to lose his temper because he loses control of himself.'

'I told him to relax,' he added.

'He was like that on and off... He started making phone calls to his auntie and then the police contacted him by phone,' Mr Paiva went on.

Shortly after speaking with the police, Ireland agreed to let Ms Carvalho go as he 'didn't want to cause any distress' to the unborn baby.

Using Mr Paiva as a human shield, Ireland opened the door for Ms Carvalho, but became agitated when he saw the police waiting outside.

Eventually Ireland agreed to give himself up telling officers he would put the knife down and would be kneeling on the stairs when they came in.

Mr Paiva said he had previously been in a similar situation when a knife was held to his throat during a mugging in New York.

Ms Carvalho said: 'I was very proud of Angelo. He remained calm and it was the best thing to do.'

Ms Carvalho gave birth to a daughter, Arya, less than two months after the incident. She is now four months old.

Last week Ireland, of no fixed address, was jailed at Ipswich Crown Court after he admitted three offences of false imprisonment, making a threat to kill and assaulting a 16-year-old youth.

He also admitted burglary at Kingsley House Hotel in Ipswich, threatening a member of staff at the hotel with a knife and assaulting a police officer.

Jailing him for seven years with a four-year extended licence period of four years, Judge Rupert Overbury said Ireland had gone on a 'violent rampage'.

The court heard that before going to Mr Paiva’s and Ms Carvalho's home, Ireland had attacked a 16-year-old boy at Chequers Hotel in Ipswich after telling him he felt like killing someone.

Ireland then walked into the kitchen of nearby Kingsley House Hotel, took a knife from the kitchen and threatened a member of staff who challenged him.

Cathy McCulloch, defending, said Ireland 'regretted' what he had done and hadn’t intended to hurt anyone with the knife.
