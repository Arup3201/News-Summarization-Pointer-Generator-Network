The chief executive of UKIP has left 
after only eight months in the job, because he struggled to adapt to the
‘individualistic DNA’ of the party.

Will Gilpin, a former RAF pilot, started at the UK Independence Party last December, hoping to make it more professional.

But
Mr Gilpin, who has also worked as a computer security guru and Home 
Office adviser, is now returning to corporate IT, which party sources 
say ‘he is far better suited to’.

'Mutual agreement'; Will Gilpin will leave his role as chief executive of UKIP

'Better suited': Gilpin will return to his career in corporate IT

Mr Gilpin, a former RAF pilot, started at the UK Independence Party last December, hoping to make it more professional.

But Mr Gilpin, who has also worked as a computer security guru and Home Office adviser, is now returning to corporate IT, which party sources say ‘he is far better suited to’.

The party said Mr Gilpin had struggled to adapt to working at a smaller organisation which relied heavily on volunteers, and where the ‘DNA is individualistic’.

UKIP insisted there was no bad blood and that the decision not to renew his contract had been made by ‘mutual agreement’.

A party spokesman said: ‘We thank him for his time, effort and the hard work he has put in and wish him all the best for the future.’

A source added that there was ‘no question of Will failing in the role’.

There is now speculation that former Tory MP turned UKIP supporter, Neil Hamilton, may take the top role. But the spokesman said he was ‘not aware’ of this.

Mr Gilpin, who describes himself as ‘socially liberal’, graduated from Cambridge with a computer science degree.

The former Tornado pilot also has a psychology degree from the Open University, makes films and builds websites.

He has already updated his profile on professional networking site LinkedIn.

It lists his past occupation as ‘CEO/Head of IT for a political party’. It does not name UKIP.

Mr Gilpin has also worked for the Home Office, Learning and Skills Council, Lloyds TSB and BP.

UKIP has enjoyed a huge surge in popularity over the past year and is now third in the opinion polls, at 14 per cent, in front of the Lib Dems on ten per cent.

But it has still been embroiled in controversy thanks to some of its more eccentric members.

Earlier this month, it emerged that UKIP 
candidate Dean Perks had given a speech supporting Sharia law. He said 
if someone was faced with the threat of having their hand chopped off, 
they would not steal.

Just days later, UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom prompted outrage by suggesting that foreign aid was going to ‘bongo bongo land’.
