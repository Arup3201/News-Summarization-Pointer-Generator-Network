A proud young dad came on the telephone from America on Tuesday night to tell us how the arrival of his first-born has given him the added motivation to up his game next month and go on to dethrone the two greatest pound-for-pound boxers in the world.

Amir Khan is deep into his training camp near San Francisco.

The pain of spending months apart from his wife and baby daughter will only be worth it if he beats Devon Alexander in Las Vegas on December 13 and then shocks Floyd Mayweather or Manny Pacquiao – or maybe even both – next year.

Khan insists that the birth of his daughter has inspired him to realise his full potential in his 'prime years'

Khan and Alexander face each other on stage at The Conga Room ahead of their December 13 fight

‘I’m a father now,’ says Khan. ‘I’m not only boxing for myself and my countries any longer. I’m fighting for my family.

‘It’s hard being away from home for so long. Very hard when you have a new baby.’

He will turn 28 five days before entering the ring against Alexander and says: ‘These are my prime years. I have to train even harder, dedicate myself even more, focus all the more intently. Our daughter gives me the drive for this commitment.’

Khan’s wife Faryal gave birth to little Lamaisah this May, a year after they married in New York.

In truth not much else of major significance has happened in the life of Bolton’s former two-time world champion since the wedding.

In the ring there has been just one fight, the solid and useful but hardly earth-shattering out-pointing of Luis Collazo. The professional inactivity derived from the false promise of a mega-bout with Mayweather.

While he was waiting for that to happen, in vain, Khan passed up a world title challenge to Alexander last December. The American then surrendered that IBF belt to Shawn Porter, who promptly lost it to Khan’s British rival Kell Brook.

Yet as Khan and Alexander finally get it on, the rewards for the victor could be bigger than any championship.

Khan is reluctant to look beyond this immediate foe – 'I’ve learned the hard way not to make that mistake again’ - but everyone knows that the Money Man and the PacMan are on both their horizons.

Promoter Oscar De La Hoya says: ‘Absolutely, I expect the winner of this one to get the big prize next year.’

The unspoken reality is that Khan is the only one of the pair who has the profile and stature to land that massive pay-night against Mayweather or Pacquiao. He also brings with him UK pay-view-revenue.

So it is to build on his box office appeal in America that he is pursuing glory over there rather than settling for loads more instant money by obliging Brook in a Wembley Battle of Britain potentially as enriching as that between Carl Froch and George Groves.

‘To be honest,’ he says, ‘Brook would be an easier fight. It was Porter’s style which helped him win that title. But beating Alexander would do more to put me back in the mix with Floyd and Manny and I always want to fight the best. Who knows? Maybe I can have Mayweather and Pacquiao in 2015.’

Maybe, with a modicum of help from little Lamaisah.

Khan was beaten by Lamont Peterson by a split decision in Washington DC, December 2011

The Bolton born boxer then followed that with an unexpected defeat by Danny Garcia in Philadelphia

‘I can’t say I’ve been changing the nappies,’ he admits. ‘My wife and our parents have been taking care of that. But after a tough day in the gym it’s always good to get home and spend time with your child. Missing that is making me work a lot harder. Often ten times harder so I have to be careful not to overdo it.’

Despite the reversal of those back-to-back defeats by a drugged Lamont Peterson and the big punching Danny Garcia two years ago, De La Hoya remains so convinced of Khan’s potential for true greatness that he has elevated him to the top of star-studded bill at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.

‘This is an honour for me,’ says Khan. ‘My first time headlining in one of boxing’s biggest arenas.’

Khan insists it is an honour for him to be headlining at 'one of boxing's greatest arenas'

Also, it is only his second fight at full welterweight and he believes he is ‘more ready’ for Alexander in this division now than he would have been a year ago.

Alexander dismisses his warm-up win over Collazo as ‘just a job Amir had to do against a fading veteran.’

Khan says: ‘That was a fight I needed to settle at 147 lbs.’ He also gives credit to Alexander for ‘taking the kind of fight boxing needs more of, between two young fighters In their prime who both have a lot to lose.’
