A kindly Walmart employee who organized a food drive for fellow workers has raised questions once more about pay and working conditions at America's biggest employer.

A picture was posted online on Thursday of a box at an Oklahoma City store asking employees to donate canned goods for 'to associates in need' on medical leave of absence.

A bake sale was also being held by employees in need in Indiana along with food drives in Ohio as campaigners put pressure on the company not to ignore the voices of employees who are going hungry. 

Walmart pays many of its workers less than $25,000 a year, Bloomberg reported last year, with some full-time employees averaging $15,500. The 2014 federal poverty line for a family of four is $23,850.

The kind employee behind the food collection is Dawnne Sulaitis, who has worked at the company for 19 years. 

She asked permission to collect canned goods and just wanted to help families down on income during the holidays. 

MailOnline was unable to reach Ms Sulaitis nor management at the Walmart store in Oklahoma City where she works on Friday however Walmart management provided their employee's statement. 

In an email from a Walmart spokesman, Ms Sulaitis' statement read: 'Two associates are on medical leave of absence and are unable to work, leaving their families who depend on two incomes down to only one.

'I think that putting a Thanksgiving meal on the table should be the last thing these people have to worry about, and so my next question was whether I could start a food drive at the store to help them out. 

'Collectively, we’re 300-plus associates at this store, and I knew that together we could make a difference. Since then, we’ve gotten two good-sized boxes of food filled, and I even baked cookies at my home to sell and raise extra money.

'But what I certainly didn’t expect? Learning that there have been quite a bit of unfavorable media stories out there regarding this drive... 

'I can’t reiterate it enough: I was just trying to lend a helping hand. There’s a lot of kindness in this store and a lot of good intentions. I don’t know who these associates are or the details of their situation, and it doesn’t matter. 

'Thanksgiving is about helping people, and I’m going to press on and keep a positive attitude about doing what I can.'   

Campaign group, Making A Change At Walmart, gave other examples of employees holding food drives to feed their colleagues. 

Staff at one Indiana store have been organizing bake sales, encouraging workers to support their colleagues with food donations.

One Pennsylvania store is reportedly organizing a holiday 'giving tree' to help out other employees, according to The United Food & Commercial Workers International Union briefing on Friday, but this has been unconfirmed.   

In Ohio, workers from Dayton, Cincinnati and other cities walked off the job in protest of the company's illegal treatment of workers, according to the campaign group.  

Community members donated food for Thanksgiving dinners while expressing outrage at the Walton family for their company's low pay and erratic scheduling. 

Pastor Troy Jackson, who was organizing donations, said: 'We're donating food to Walmart workers today because that's what neighbors do. But we shouldn't have to. 

'The Waltons are the richest family in America and their company can afford to pay its employees a decent wage.'

Rich pickings: The Walton siblings from left, Alice Walton, Jim Walton and Wal-Mart Chairman Rob Walton, the children of the late Wal-Mart Stores Inc. founder Sam Walton, appear on stage during the company's annual shareholder meeting in Fayetteville, Arkansas. The Walton clan are worth more than $150bn

Raymond Bravo and other Walmart workers block traffic in front of the San Leandro store on Thanksgiving weekend last year. Bravo who was fired from the California store after organizing for better wages and working conditions was later arrested long with four others

The organization is asking that Walmart pay a living wage of $15 an hour and provide consistent, full-time hours for its staff.  

One employee from Minnesota, Cantare Davunt, added: 'We work hard and we don't want charity. We want a fair wage.' 

The campaign group said that many employees are afraid to speak out about their conditions for fear of having their hours cut or even being fired.

Black Friday strikes have been organized by Walmart campaigners across the U.S. at Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Miami and D.C. 

Walmart spokesman Cory Lundberg told MailOnline on Friday that Walmart offers 'extremely competitive' wages and has a unique program allowing staff members to pick up extra hours. 

Campaigners counter that by Walmart raising the wage standard, its influential power as America's biggest employer would have a 'trickle down effect' on other retailers.

Walmart confirmed the average hourly rate for full-time and part-time associates is $11.83. 

For full-time associates the average hourly wage is $12.92. Walmart classes full-time as 34 (or more) hours per week. 

Mr Lundberg  said those who are campaigning for higher wages represent a small minority of the '1.3 million people who choose to come to work at Walmart each day', highlighting the companies opportunities for promotion.

For those at the lower-end of the wage scale, Mr Lundberg said they would still earn more at Walmart 'than a unionized grocery store down the street'.

He said that strikes in 2013 claimed to be taking place at 1,600 locations but in the end only represented a small segment of their workers.  

He added that Ms Sulaitis efforts were much appreciated by her colleagues 'because they were missing their Walmart wages'.

In 2013, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation gave in cash and in-kind contributions of $1.3 billion around the world, the company added.

The Walton Family is the richest family in America, with Christy, Jim, Alice and Rob Walton, consistently being in the top ten of the Forbes 400 since 2001 with a combined wealth of more than $150billion. 

Despite their extreme wealth, according to a union-backed report by the Walmart 1percent and cited by Forbes, the Waltons contributed just $17.6million to charity between 2008 and 2013.

They make around $8.5million a day from their Walmart dividends. 

Over the same period, Warren Buffet contributed $8.4 billion to non-profit organizations – 477 times more than the Waltons combined. 

Dawnne Sulaitis, Dairy Department Manager at Walmart said in a statement on Friday: 

'To me, Thanksgiving is a time to reflect on what you have and what you can do for others. 

My store is practicing this for our community right now with a coat drive for an area homeless shelter, and I’ve been doing my part by washing the coats, so they’re clean and ready to go. About three weeks ago, I wondered if there was anything else I could do closer to home, so I asked our store’s personnel manager if there were any associates we work with who needed extra help this season. 

The answer was yes. Two associates are on medical leave of absence and are unable to work, leaving their families who depend on two incomes down to only one.

 I think that putting a Thanksgiving meal on the table should be the last thing these people have to worry about, and so my next question was whether I could start a food drive at the store to help them out. Collectively, we’re 300-plus associates at this store, and I knew that together we could make a difference. 

Since then, we’ve gotten two good-sized boxes of food filled, and I even baked cookies at my home to sell and raise extra money. It’s been great to see everyone’s positive reaction here to helping associates who are facing the unexpected. 

But what I certainly didn’t expect? Learning that there have been quite a bit of unfavorable media stories out there regarding this drive. I talked with at least four reporters today, and I told each of them that I really appreciate them listening and wanting to hear from me directly. 

I can’t reiterate it enough: I was just trying to lend a helping hand. There’s a lot of kindness in this store and a lot of good intentions. 

'I don’t know who these associates are or the details of their situation, and it doesn’t matter. 

Thanksgiving is about helping people, and I’m going to press on and keep a positive attitude about doing what I can.'
