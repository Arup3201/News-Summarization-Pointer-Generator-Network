A one-cent postage stamp belonging to the late eccentric heir and famous murderer John du Pont has become the world's most valuable stamp - again.

The 1856 British Guiana One-Cent Magenta sold on Tuesday at auction in New York for $9.5 million - although the stamp expected to bring between $10 million and $20 million.

Still, the sale became the fourth time the stamp has broken the auction record for a single stamp in its long history.

Sotheby's said the buyer wished to remain anonymous. The price included the buyer's premium.

David Redden, Sotheby's vice chairman, called the sale 'a truly great moment for the world of stamp collecting.'

'That price will be hard to beat, and likely won't be exceeded unless the British Guiana comes up for sale again in the future,' Redden said.

Measuring 1 inch-by-1 1/4 inches, it hasn't been on public view since 1986 and is the only major stamp absent from the British Royal Family's private Royal Philatelic Collection.

'You're not going to find anything rarer than this,' according to Allen Kane, director of the Smithsonian National Postal Museum.

'It's a stamp the world of collectors has been dying to see for a long time.'

An 1855 Swedish stamp, which sold for $2.3 million in 1996, previously held the auction record for a single stamp.  

Owner: John E. du Pont, pictured in 1992, bought the stamp in 1980 and it was sold off after his death

Killed: Du Pont, left, was found to be mentally 
ill when he shot dead Olympic wrestler David Schultz, left and right, at
 his estate. The wrestler had been training the Olympic team at the time
 of the killing in 1996

Scene: Du Pont locked himself inside his mansion in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania for two days until police switched off his power and caught him when he went outside to fix a heater

1856 The
 stamp went into circulation after a
 shipment of stamps was delayed from London. Printers in British Guiana 
produced three stamps - including the one cent - to serve in their place
 until the shipment arrived.

1873 Louis
 Vernon Vaughan, 12, discovered the stamp in letter left by his uncle. 
The boy sells it to a local collector for six shillings, about $1.44 
today.

1878 McKinnon
 sold it to a Liverpool dealer who 
recognized it as uncommon. He paid 120 pounds 
for it and resold it for 150 pounds to Count Philippe la 
Renotiere von Ferrary, one of the world's greatest stamp collectors.

1917
 The count bequeathed his stamp collection to the Postmuseum in Berlin -
 but it was later seized by France as war reparations and sold off 
in a series of 14 auctions with the One-Cent Magenta bringing $35,000 in
 1922.

1940 Its 
buyer, Arthur
 Hind, a textile magnate from Utica, New York, died in 1933 and in 1940,
 it was sold privately by his widow to Frederick Small for $45,000

1970 The stamp was put up for auction and it was purchased by an investment consortium for $280,000.

1980 J.E. du Pont bought the stamp for $935,000.

June 17, 2014 The stamp will be auctioned by Sotheby's in New York, where it is expected to fetch as much as $20 million

David Beech, longtime curator of stamps at the British Library who retired last year, has compared it to buying the 'Mona Lisa' of the world's most prized stamps.

The last owner was John E. du Pont, an heir to the du Pont chemical fortune who was convicted of fatally shooting 1984 Olympic champion wrestler David Schultz at his Pennsylvania estate in 1996.

The stamp was sold by his estate, which will designate part of the proceeds to the Eurasian Pacific Wildlife Conservation Foundation that du Pont championed.

Printed in black on magenta paper, it bears the image of a three-masted ship and the colony's motto, in Latin: 'we give and expect in return.'

It went into circulation after a shipment of stamps was delayed from London and the postmaster asked printers for the Royal Gazette newspaper in Georgetown in British Guiana to produce three stamps until the shipment arrived: a 1-cent magenta, a 4-cent magenta and a 4-cent blue.

While multiple examples of the 4-cent stamps have survived, only the tiny 1-cent issue is known to exist today.

Its first owner was a 12-year-old Scottish boy living in South America who added it to his collection after finding it among family papers in 1873. He soon sold it for a few shillings to a local collector, Neil McKinnon.

McKinnon kept it for five years before selling it to a Liverpool dealer who recognized the unassuming stamp as highly uncommon. He paid 120 pounds for it and quickly resold it for 150 pounds to Count Philippe la Renotiere von Ferrary, one of the world's greatest stamp collectors.

Upon his 
death in 1917, the count bequeathed his stamp collection to the 
Postmuseum in Berlin. The collection was later seized by France as war 
reparations and sold off in a series of 14 auctions with the One-Cent 
Magenta bringing $35,000 in 1922 - an auction record for a single stamp.

Arthur
 Hind, a textile magnate from Utica, New York, was the buyer. King 
George V was an under-bidder. It is the one major piece absent from the 
Royal Family's heirloom collection, Beech said.

After Hind's death in 1933, the stamp was to be auctioned with the rest of his collection until his wife brought a lawsuit, claiming it was left to her.

The next owner was Frederick Small, an Australian engineer living in Florida who purchased it privately from Hind's widow for $45,000 in 1940. Thirty years later, he consigned the stamp to a New York auction where it was purchased by an investment consortium for $280,000 - another record.The stamp set its third record in 1980 when it sold for $935,000 to du Pont.
