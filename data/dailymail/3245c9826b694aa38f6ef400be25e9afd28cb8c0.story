The draw for the play-off round takes place on Friday. Follow it LIVE with MailOnline Sport.

Arsenal could face a tricky Champions League qualifier against the likes of Athletic Bilbao, Lille, Besiktas or Panathanaikos when the draw for the play-off round is made on Friday.

Arsene Wenger's side will be one of the seeded teams in the draw along with Porto, Napoli and Bayer Leverkusen, but the unseeded teams could include a number of dangerous teams.

Along with the four teams mentioned above, Athletic Bilbao will also enter the competition at the play-off round stage, but they may not be seeded if Zenit win their third-qualifying round tie against Limassol as the Russian team have a higher coefficient than the Spaniards.

Standard Liege (BEL) 38.260

Grasshoppers (SUI) 9.645

AEL Limassol (CYP) 7.650 

But Andre Villas-Boas' Zenit team are the only side currently playing in the third qualifying round who can dislodge Bilbao from one of the seeded positions, meaning the likes of Lille, Besiktas and Panathanaikos will be unseeded should they qualify.

The second legs of the third-qualifying round ties take place this Tuesday and Wednesday, August 5 and 6.

The draw for the qualifying stages is divided into two sections - the league route and the champions route. 

The champions route features all the teams who won their respective domestic league last season such as Celtic, Sparta Prague and Steaua Bucharest.
