A pair of criminals who plotted to break in and steal valuable Chinese artefacts worth £1.8m from a museum have denied smashing a wall in the premises and grabbing the precious items.

Durham University's Oriental Museum was the scene of a highly-professional, high-stakes raid last Easter, Durham Crown Court heard.

Thieves escaped with an 18th Century jade bowl and a Dehua porcelain figurine which dated from the Qing Dynasty in a night-time break-in last April.

Lee Wildman, 35, and Adrian Stanton, 32, both from Walsall, admitted conspiracy to burgle at a previous hearing on the basis that they were recruited to help unnamed figures who carried out the break-in.

That basis of plea was rejected and Judge Christopher Prince is hearing a trial of issue to determine what role they played. The two will be sentenced on Friday, along with four others.

Wildman, tall and with a clean shaven head, told the judge he and Stanton were recruited from the West Midlands to help figures in the North East after chatting to associates at a garage in Walsall.

He said they travelled to Durham, without knowing what they were to be asked to do, as they needed 'to earn some money'.

There, they met some people in a silver Mercedes at a car park, who asked them both to go into a building - the museum - and grab Chinese artefacts, the older the better, Wildman said.

'They said: "Get any Chinese pieces for us you can",' he told the court.

Thieves tunneled into Durham's Oriental Museum before making straight for an 18th century jade bowl and a Dehua porcelain figurine

But security staff made him check in his rucksack so they had no opportunity to break into the cabinets and grab the items.

CCTV
images played in court showed the men testing the locks on the cabinets
in preparation for the raid later, the prosecution claimed.

When
the men left empty-handed, the gang in the car outside were angry, 
Wildman said, and grew aggressive. So he offered to provide them with 
stolen cars, for a fee of £1,000 each, he claimed.

That
explained a series of journeys police have traced using number plate 
recognition cameras between Walsall and Durham over the following days.

Wildman insisted he did not take part in the raid at the museum which took place in the evening of April 5 last year.

Peter Makepeace, prosecuting, said Wildman was telling 'a pack of lies'.

Wildman declined to name any of the people at the garage in Walsall or in the North East, saying his life would be in danger.

Mr Makepeace told Wildman: 'You are a man who has considerable experience of burgling.'

He replied from the dock: 'A long time ago. I have never been involved in stuff like this before.'

Both stolen items were recovered later.

They were from the Qing Dynasty, the last imperial dynasty in China, which ruled from 1644 to 1911.

The large green jade bowl, dating from 1769, is from the collection of Sir Charles Hardinge, a British collector of jades and hardstones. A Chinese poem is written inside.

The Dehua porcelain sculpture, which has a cream white glaze and depicts seven fairies in a boat, is 30cm in both height and length.

The hearing continues.
