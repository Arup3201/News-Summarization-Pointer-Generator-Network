Warning: International Development Secretary Justine Greening has warned ministers that frivolous spending was undermining the case for foreign aid

British aid to China is being used to upgrade business parks, promote trade union rights and fund social media training for gay rights activists.

A Daily Mail investigation reveals that British taxpayers’ money is still being squandered on an industrial scale in China – even being used to raise awareness of climate change in a country that is building two coal-fired power stations every week. 

The spending was revealed as it emerged International Development Secretary Justine Greening has warned ministers that frivolous spending was undermining the case for foreign aid.

And it makes a mockery of David Cameron’s claim this week that none of the £11billion aid budget can be diverted to help British flood victims without hitting the world’s poor.

The Daily Mail has highlighted the plight of those whose lives have been made a misery by UK flooding and almost 250,000 have now signed our petition calling for overseas aid funds to be used for flood relief and defences. 

Meanwhile, Miss Greening has written to every member of the Cabinet warning them that aid spending must be targeted to ‘where it is needed most'.

She is said to be particularly concerned that some climate change projects risk undermining public confidence in the foreign aid budget.

The latest Government figures reveal that in 2012 Britain sent £27.4million to China – despite it sitting on more than £2trillion in foreign exchange reserves.

Some £22.5million was provided by the Foreign Office, with the remainder coming from the Commonwealth Development Corporation, which is owned by Miss Greening’s Department for International Development (Dfid).

Documents released under Freedom of Information reveal the bulk of the aid has gone on initiatives to tackle climate change in China – where the State is building two coal-fired power stations a week.

They include a £100,000 initiative to ‘upgrade’ industrial parks to help them reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, while £70,000 has gone on promoting the idea that China should enact a law to limit emissions.

But there has also been funding for a ‘recruitment hotline’ for the disabled and an initiative to help China recruit care home workers.

Britain has also funded an event to ‘identify realistic and practical mechanisms for collective bargaining in South China’.

There has even been support for a project to train ‘lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community workers to help them make better use of social media’.

Tory MP Peter Bone warned the revelations would further undermine public confidence in Britain’s aid budget.

He said: ‘It shows once again that we could easily divert some of the billions squandered abroad to help some of the flood victims facing a real emergency in this country.’

The Foreign Office said encouraging China to develop its renewable energy resources would help ‘make global energy supplies more stable and affordable’.

But the TaxPayers’ Alliance said there was no justification for sending aid to China. Spokesman Robert Oxley said: ‘It is utterly bizarre that money set aside to help the world’s poorest is being squandered in a country whose economy is booming. It is worse still that cash is being spent on Facebook training and exporting green vanity projects.’

A leaked letter from Miss Greening to fellow Cabinet ministers reveals she is increasingly concerned about the way other departments – in particular the Department of Energy and Climate Change and the Foreign Office – are spending aid money.

The tone of Miss Greening’s letter is likely to raise eyebrows in Whitehall, where Dfid is facing serious questions about its own  budget management.

China, which sent a mission to the moon in December, is one of 16 countries that supposedly had its aid programme ‘axed’ in 2011.

But the latest Dfid figures reveal 15 of those were handed £131.9million between them in 2012. Only the small aid programme to Russia ended completely.
