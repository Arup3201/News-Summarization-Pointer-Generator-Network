Poisoned: Kieran Cockburn, 36, was found dead by his worried boss after he failed to show for work

A chef was killed by deadly fumes from a disposable barbecue lit in 'mysterious' circumstances inside his flat.

Kieran Cockburn, 36, from Beast Banks, Kendal, was found dead by his worried boss after he failed to show for work at the Castle Green Hotel, Kendal, Cumbria, an inquest heard.

Police found the burnt-out grill on a coffee table in his apartment shortly after midday on May 31.

Although South and East Cumbria coroner Ian Smith said the barbecue was given as the cause of death by a pathologist - mystery surrounds exactly why it was there.

He recorded a open verdict at Kendal County Court on November 29th.

He said there was no explanation for the barbecue’s presence and explained there was insufficient evidence to conclude Mr Cockburn placed the grill indoors deliberately to kill himself, or that he had been cooking on it inside oblivious to its danger.

It follows several deaths caused by the devices nationwide this year, including one at Ullswater in March.

Inspector Rob Lampard - the first officer on scene at Collin Croft, off Beast Banks, Kendal - said Mr Cockburn’s death followed national publicity about a child who had died after falling asleep near a disposable barbecue while camping in Shropshire.

Inspector Lampard told Mr Smith that there ‘didn’t seem to be any reason’ for the barbecue to be in the flat because it appeared no food had been cooked on it and he found the remains of a Chinese meal nearby.

The inquest heard from Mr Cockburn’s GP, Dr Michael Brennan, who said his patient had suffered from the ‘unpleasant’ bowel condition Crohn’s disease since he was 30, had undergone ‘big surgery’ because of it and was taking quite a lot of medication.

He said that in the months before his death, Mr Cockburn said he was ‘feeling down’ and waking up during the night so he was prescribed sleeping tablets and anti-depressant drug mirtazapine.

But Dr Brennan told the hearing Mr Cockburn gave no indication he wanted to take his own life.

Grace Williamson, Mr Cockburn’s manager at the Castle Green Hotel, where he had worked since September 2005, said he was sent home poorly on the evening of Saturday, May 26 and was off work sick the day after.

Failed attempts were made to contact him during the week but when he could still not be reached by Thursday, she visited his flat where she found him dead.

Mr Smith suggested Mr Cockburn might have brought it inside to keep warm - something he described as a ‘bad idea’ - or to cook, although there was no remnants of food. And he ruled out any third party involvement.

'I am well short of the necessary certainty that Kieran did this perhaps with the intention of killing himself,' said Mr Smith.

'He was feeling low but there’s no indication he was suicidal.

'It could be that he was doing something really not advisable with the barbecue because they are, as we have learned, potentially lethal in an enclosed space.'
