Budget airline carrier Allegiant Air has come under attack after one of their flights took off more than 11 hours behind schedule.

Flight 1032 was schedule to leave Oakland International Airport for Provo, Utah, at 9.30am on Monday.

However the plane had to be towed back to the terminal due to a steering issue.

All passengers were asked to get off the flight and go back inside the terminal.

Allegiant then organized a replacement craft, which was slated to leave at 4pm - some 6.5 hours later.

However that plane was also reported as having mechanical problems.

Not happy: Passengers have been left outraged after being delayed by almost 12 hours for a routine 1.5 hour Allegiant Air domestic flight

A third plane was then brought in.

It arrived in Oakland at 6.40pm.

'Passengers were boarded quickly. However the captain requested additional fuel and the aircraft returned to the gate before departing for Provo at 8.48pm,' Allegiant said in a statement to CBS News.

The flight landed in Provo at 10.22pm, almost 12 hours behind schedule.

According to Google maps a driver could make the same trip from Oakland to Provo in just over 11 hours.

Allegiant's statement said replacement planes were brought in because there weren't enough on the ground in Oakland.

All the aircraft were Boeing MD 83s.

Allegiant said every effort was made to ensure passengers 'were as comfortable as possible' and that they were never stuck in a aircraft on a tarmac during the delay.

Stuck: An unknown number of passengers were stranded here at Oakland International Airport following an extreme flight delay on Monday

'We provided food and beverages, $100 off vouchers and the option to cancel or reschedule the flight at no additional cost,' they said.

However that was hardly enough to please their unhappy customers.

'I am outraged. This airline should go out of business immediately,' one wrote on Twitter.

Another vowed to never fly Allegiant again, saying: 'I'll probably tell everyone not to fly it, either.'

Someone else called the situation 'cruel and unusual punishment'.

'These people are so insensitive . Been 12 hours at the airport and it's ridiculous. They should be out of business.'

It is not known how many passengers were affected by the delay.
