Many of us are familiar with the frustration of a paint job botched by a dodgy decorator.

But when the blunder takes a multi-billionaire’s mega-yacht out of action, the result can be explosive – and rather expensive.

Russian chemical tycoon Andrey Melnichenko, who is worth nearly £9 billion and owns a sprawling estate in Berkshire, is suing Dulux owner Akzo Nobel for $100million – or £62million.

Mega-yacht: Called simply 'A' the paint job on the floating palace has left its billionaire owner unimpressed

His claim, filed in a New Jersey court, argues the paint company’s incompetence forced him to redecorate his £200 million, 391-foot luxury yacht.

The total includes £15 million to cover the cost of touching up the paint job as well as a monthly payment of £2.5 million to pay for hiring a replacement vessel in the 18 months when the yacht will be out of action.

Documents filed at the court state: ‘In addition to attorney’s fees and costs, these damages represent over $100 million in ascertainable losses on the part of the plaintiff.’

The vessel, named ‘A’ after Mr Melnichenko’s model wife Aleksandra, made waves in the luxury yachting world when it first took to the seas in 2008.

The ship was longer than Roman Abramovich’s Pelorus, which at the time was the largest vessel in the Chelsea owner’s fleet.

Designed by French interiors guru Philippe Starck, it boasts a dance floor with a glass ceiling – which also forms the bottom of a swimming pool on the deck above.

The master bedroom is only accessible via a fingerprint recognition system and is protected with bomb-proof glass.

One of the king-size beds rotates at the touch of a button, the walls are decorated with white stingray skin and the taps in the baths are believed to be worth £25,000 apiece.

The ‘A’ costs more than £12 million a year to maintain, with each refuelling racking up a bill of more than £300,000.

Given the huge expense of his floating palace, it might come as no surprise that Mr Melnichenko, 41, was upset when it didn’t get the paint job he felt it deserved.

The row began when Akzo Nobel, the company that owns Dulux, was commissioned to provide a high-quality finish for the mega-yacht.

As the work neared completion, ‘problems appeared in the finish,’ the court documents claim.

The paint appeared to be ‘running’ and the coats began separating from each other causing ‘lines and sags’.

The finish was also not as reflective as Mr Melnichenko expected, resulting in what he claims is a ‘cloudy’ overall appearance.

The vessel was repainted at Akzo 
Nobel’s own cost, but the second coat was ‘unsatisfactory’ and lawyers 
say a new coat will now take 18 months.

The couple are no strangers to shelling out large amounts of money. In 2007 they spent £1 million hiring Jennifer Lopez to sing.

They own the £24-million Harewood Estate in Ascot, Berkshire, and previously owned a £3 million flat in Berkeley Square.
