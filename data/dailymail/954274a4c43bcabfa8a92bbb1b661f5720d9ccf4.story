Zubair Nur, 19, is suspected of attempting to travel to Syria to join ISIS

The deputy head boy of a prestigious Church of England school is feared to have fled the country to join Islamic State.

Zubair Nur, 19, is suspected of attempting to travel to Syria to join the terrorist group after he began posting messages praising hate preachers and extremist leaders. 

The formerly 'happy-go-lucky' student had also started dressing in traditional Muslim attire.

Nur's family had raised the alarm after hearing that he had gone missing from university. 

Police are on high alert for the teenager who they believe may try and cross the border in Turkey.

Nur was once a former assistant head boy at Chelsea academy in Surrey and had left the school with good A level grades last year.

Former pupils at his school described him as a 'normal' teenager who loved comedy -  particularly Michael McIntyre.'

One friend told The Sun that his Facebook posts praising terror chiefs had been out of character.

'It set off an alarm bell among people who knew him,' they added. 'He wasn't known at all for causing trouble or having extreme views.'

An anti-radicalisation team from the the Home Office has now been sent to the school to speak to sixth formers.

Lax security has prompted calls for checks on unaccompanied teenagers travelling to Turkey – after it emerged children as young as 13 are allowed to fly with no questions asked.

Counter-terrorism officers revealed three girls, two aged 15 and one of 16, all from London, had flown to Turkey, a staging post for extremists wanting to cross the border to join IS. They were not challenged as they boarded a flight to Istanbul at Gatwick on Tuesday. The girls were travelling with Turkish Airlines, which allows 13- to 17-year-olds to travel without supervision. The teenagers were linked by police to another 15-year-old girl who joined IS in December.

Exit checks at UK borders were scrapped in 1997. Home Secretary Theresa May has pledged to reintroduce them from April.

Emily Dyer, a research fellow specialising in terrorism at the Henry Jackson Society think-tank, said: ‘Security needs to be stepped up. It should have alerted suspicions.’

The university had written to his family to inform them that Nur had not attended lectures since January and his mother Muna, 43, from Fulham, West London, then reported him missing to Scotland Yard.

An Interpol manhunt is now under way to track down Nur in Turkey where ISIS recruits attempt to cross the border into Syria.

Zubair Nur is the latest in number of young Muslims who are feared to have travelled to Syria to join ISIS.

Last month, three schoolgirls, aged 15 and 16, flew out of the UK to join jihadists in Syria.

Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and a 15-year-old German girl, who has not been named at the request of her family, were believed to have left to marry jihadi fighters.

It is understood the three girls – all straight-A pupils – were lured to Syria via social media by a school friend who is already there.

There have been growing calls to tighten up security checks on youngsters flying out of the UK. 

Around 550 young Britons are thought to have made the journey to join Islamic State.

Just last week, nine British medical students and doctors were believed to have travelled to the war-torn country to work in areas controlled by Islamic State militants.

The group, all in their late teens or early 20s, had been studying medicine in Sudan and some have sent messages home to their parents to say they were doing voluntary work.

They include Mohammed Wael Fadlallah, Tasneem Suliman, Ismail Hamdoun, Nada Sami Kader, Mohammed Elbadri Ibrahim, Rowan Kamal Zine El Abidine, Tamir Ahmed Abusibah, Lena Maumoon, Sami Ahmed Kadir.

Family of the medical students were said to be extremely concerned about their welfare and some had travelled to Gaziantep in southern Turkey to try to find them.

Islamic State has even published a detailed travel guide for would-be recruits with information on how to get to Syria and what they should pack.

The 50-page manual called Hijrah, meaning 'holy emigration', includes details of safe houses and routes for Western wannabe jihadists and has been compared to a gap year travel guide.

Aimed specifically at young people, its full title is 'Hijrah to the Islamic State: What to pack up, who to contact and where to go. Stories and more!'

Published in English, it boasts that ISIS members 'live in Turkey in some peace because Turkey fears revenge attacks', enabling them to help ISIS recruits slip over the border into neighbouring Syria without being caught.
