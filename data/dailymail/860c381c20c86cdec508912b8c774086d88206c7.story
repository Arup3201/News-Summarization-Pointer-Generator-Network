There was an error at Game 5 of the World Series even before the first pitch.

Staind rocker-turned-country singer Aaron Lewis stumbled early on during his rendition of The Star-Spangled Banner on Sunday night at the AT&T Park in San Francisco.

After starting with 'O say can you see by the dawn's early light, what so proudly we hailed,' Lewis, 42, diverted from the lyrics.
