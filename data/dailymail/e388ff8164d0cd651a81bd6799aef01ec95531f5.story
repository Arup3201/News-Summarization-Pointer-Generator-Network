LEAVING BEFORE THE RAINS COME

by Alexandra Fuller

(Harvill Secker £16.99)

That awful book, was how Alexandra Fuller’s mother, Nicola, always referred to Don’t Let’s Go To The Dogs Tonight, her daughter’s bestselling account of growing up in Africa.

But Nicola — whose love of literature was exceeded only by her passion for alcohol — had always encouraged her daughter to write, and she became the heroine of Alexandra’s second memoir, Cocktail Hour Under The Tree Of Forgetfulness.

In her latest memoir, Fuller turns her fiercely observant gaze on her own life as a wife and mother, telling the story of the marriage that took her from the perils of Africa to a very different kind of hazard in Wyoming.

‘When I was breaking down my reason for marrying Charlie to other people,’ she writes, ‘I said, “He looked good on a horse . . . ” What I never would have confessed was the truth: at 22, I was already exhausted and what I projected onto Charlie’s broad-shouldered frame was an embellished biography that made him both my sanctuary and my saviour.

‘I believed if I moored myself to Charlie, I would know tranquillity interspersed with organised adventure.’

Fuller’s early childhood was fraught with adventure of the most catastrophic kind. Growing up in a country undergoing the bloody metamorphosis from Rhodesia into Zimbabwe, she and her sister, Vanessa, travelled in an armoured Land Rover and learned to strip and fire a gun.

They dressed for dinner each night, and were taught that the greatest sin of all was to be boring.

But just below the brittle surface of old-fashioned, upper-class social mores lay chaos and death. Three of Alexandra’s four siblings died young, and the accumulation of tragedy tipped her mother into depression and alcoholism.

‘It takes a kind of outrageous courage . . . to revel in the pattern of that much definite chaos,’ she writes. ‘I had been raised in this way . . . but at some point, I had lost the mettle and the imagination to surrender to the promise of perpetual insecurity.’

Charlie Ross seemed to offer the ideal combination of excitement and security. Eleven years older than Alexandra, he was a dashing adventurer with a degree in international business, who told stories about white water rafting in Siberia and helicopter skiing in Yosemite. Best of all, he seemed unworried by the prospect of meeting her parents.

When she warned him that her father would probably wave a shotgun at him, he said: ‘That’s OK. I’ve spent every summer of my life on my grandmother’s ranch in Wyoming and she waves her shotgun at everyone, especially after cocktail hour.’

Six months later, they were engaged. Six months after that, she married him on her parents’ farm. At the wedding, an old, Polish priest told her: ‘The first year is hard and, after that, it gets worse.’

He was right. Almost as soon as the honeymoon was over, the marriage ran into trouble: ‘The first year was hard and, after that . . . it got more and more silent, and silence frightened me more than almost anything else.’ Charlie’s safari business struggled, Alexandra couldn’t find a job and, when their first baby was born, their charming but mosquito-infested cottage on the banks of the Zambezi River proved an impossible place in which to live with a newborn.

By the time they decided to leave Africa for America, ‘Charlie’s love for me was waning — I’d been a disappointment, it was obvious . . . but I was still his wife and the mother of his child; there still remained a residue of dutiful love in sickness and in health’.

After 15 years, two more children and much couples’ counselling, that residue of dutiful love was exhausted.

Charlie’s real estate business was crippled by the 2008 U.S. mortgage crisis, and Alexandra’s attempts to write them out of trouble weren’t enough. By 2011, they were so trapped by debt that when Alexandra asked for a divorce, Charlie told her they couldn’t afford it: everything they owned belonged to the bank.

When circumstances are intolerable, something has to give. Five months after their 19th wedding anniversary, Charlie’s horse, Big Boy, fell and rolled on him.

He suffered a series of strokes and his life was saved only when Alexandra insisted, against medical advice, that he be moved to a hospital with an expert neurology unit.

In the movies, this would be the moment the couple rediscovered their love. But there is no fairytale ending here: ‘You can have an intense connection to someone without being a good, lifelong mate for him. Love is complicated and difficult that way.’

To use your own life as the raw material for a book is an enterprise fraught with hazard.

Yet in this hauntingly beautiful memoir, Fuller combines unsparing — and often very funny — self-analysis with an aching tenderness for the family she and Charlie couldn’t keep intact and a deep love of Africa, the beloved country of her childhood where she no longer really belongs.
