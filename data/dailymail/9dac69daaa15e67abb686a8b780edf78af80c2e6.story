The son of a man killed by a drugs overdose given by a foreign doctor said today he would not be 'shut up' despite being ordered to pay the medic thousands of pounds in legal costs for calling him an 'animal'. 

An inquest found David Gray, 70, was unlawfully killed in 2008 after Dr Daniel Ubani, who was working as an out-of-hours locum on his first shift in the UK, fatally administered 10 times the normal dose of diamorphine.

Mr Gray's son, Rory, 49, has been sued in a German court by Ubani after he and his brother Stuart, himself a GP, confronted the doctor at a Bavarian conference and called him an 'animal', 'charlatan' and a 'killer'.

Dr Ubani, who now works in Germany as a doctor after being struck off in Britain, sued Mr Gray and secured a ruling demanding he pays three quarters of Dr Ubani's legal costs and writes a letter promising never to call him an animal again.

But Mr Gray said it would not change his belief that Dr Ubani presents a danger to the public, even though the German authorities are satisfied he is safe to practise.

He said: 'He's tried to shut us up and it shows a complete lack of remorse. His entire agenda is to prevent the truth coming out'.

'I have been banned from using a certain phrase and I won't use that phrase. But I will continue to say that Ubani is a charlatan and a killer'. 

His father had been suffering renal colic when he was treated by Nigerian-born Dr Ubani at his home on February 16, 2008, and died from a massive diamorphine overdose.

His death highlighted national concerns about the standard of locum doctors from abroad working in the UK.

Coroner William Morris described Mr Gray's death as 'gross negligence and manslaughter' and said Dr Ubani was 'incompetent'.

Dr Ubani admitted he had confused the morphine with another drug.

He had flown into the UK the day before his 12-hour Cambridgeshire shift for GP service provider Take Care Now, and had only had a few hours' sleep, a GMC panel was told.

A doctor who gave him an induction expressed concerns that Dr Ubani had no NHS experience, did not know the area, and that he did not have enough time to properly train him.

The disgraced doctor has since refused to return to the UK, where he has been struck off the medical register.

Four years ago Mr Gray's sons sought him out and called Nigerian-born Ubani a 'charlatan' and a 'killer' and demanded he explain his 'colossal blunder'.

Shortly before they were thrown out of the conference, Rory muttered to his brother that Ubani was an 'animal' – something he had said he was unaware of until it was mentioned in legal documents long after the incident in 2010.

Accord to the Daily Telegraph the legal fees he would be expected  runs into the thousands.

'It makes me feel physically sick, it is quite hard to believe,' Rory, who lives in Germany and works for the country's weather office, told the Daily Telegraph.

'We went to that conference because we were determined to make things safer for people - what we have done has changed the laws to make things safer across Europe.

'The General Medical Council has thanked us, the politicians have thanked us but now this. It shows the man has no integrity, no remorse.'

The medic was struck off by the British General Medical Council but was able to continue working in Germany.

He was charged with death by negligence at a court in Witten but was let off with a nine-month suspended prison sentence and ordered him to pay costs of 5,000 euros, or £4,100.

The disgraced doctor has since refused to return to the UK, and a European arrest warrant was issued by Cambridgeshire Police but could not be carried out because legal proceedings had begun in Germany.

The case was almost identical to one Ubani brought against the Grays in August 2010.

On that occasion his claim for compensation was thrown out and he had to pay the brothers' legal costs.

The German court also ruled they could refer to him as a 'charlatan and a killer' but not describe him as an 'animal'. Ubani later lost an appeal at Munich High Court. 

David Gray's death in 2008 prompted a review of out-of-hours services, particularly a loophole which allowed doctors from the EU with poor English to practise here because of rules on the free movement of labour.

In June new laws were introduced that allow the GMC to withhold a licence if they have concerns about an individual.

The regulator wrote to the Grays congratulating them on their efforts to have the law changed.

Tanja Schubert, its head of European and international affairs, said: 'We could not have achieved this without your support.'
