Argos may not be known as a trend-setter but the catalogue chain showed it has some street cred when responding to a customer's complaint on Twitter.

Immy 'Badman' Bugti contacted the store on the social networking site to ask when it would be 'gettin da ps4 tings' referring to PlayStation 4 games consoles at his local store, adding: 'Ain't waitin no more.'

He added that a sales assistant in the store in Moss Side, Manchester was rude with 'bare attitude'.
