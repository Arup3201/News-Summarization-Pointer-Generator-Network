It's almost 29 years to the week since I made my Arsenal debut as a 19-year-old. That feels like a lifetime ago, but some things in football never change: everybody wants to see young players come through. The good news is that this season more managers are willing to give the kids a chance.

So far 21 players aged 21 or under have made their Premier League debuts this campaign. More than half of those are defenders and that’s unusual for a position that requires great maturity. But it does prove one thing: if you’re good enough, you’re old enough.

This year Manchester United’s Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair, Eric Dier at Tottenham and Hull’s Andrew Robertson, whose average age is just under 20, have each made a significant impact on his team. That is good to see.

Too many people think the step up from youth team to first team is a massive one. Yes there is a jump in quality, but if you’re an ambitious youngster, it should just be another game.

The problem for young players is that it often takes a special set of circumstances to play. Are they ready? Is the incumbent injured or out of form? What if they don’t fit the manager’s style?

Managers are under so much pressure that they might not want to play a young lad in a key role. That’s why you tend to see more young attackers than defenders playing. Defenders normally get better with age.

It’s human nature to look at what people can’t do but if you make yourself part of a winning team, those doubts quickly disappear. Possession is nine tenths of the law in football — if you’ve got the shirt and the side is winning, then the manager has a difficult decision to make.

At Arsenal, John Cartwright had to persuade Don Howe to play me but after the first game at West Brom my next two were against Liverpool and Man United. We won both.

Tony Adams was already playing and our youth team included Michael Thomas, David Rocastle, Niall Quinn and Paul Merson.

A group like that is rare, but when we saw Tony doing it — and he went on to become the club’s youngest captain at 21 —we knew we could make it too: success breeds success.

Some managers don’t trust young players in positions of responsibility —they would sooner play a young goalkeeper than a young centre half.

But Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has always been happy to field young players and his use of Blackett and McNair this season is first-class management. People assume playing centre back at Old Trafford is too much pressure for a kid. These two have shown otherwise.

I don’t think either would have had a chance of playing last season but now they are important members of United’s squad. Blackett is strong, fast and a quick learner, an important skill for any defender.

My sources tell me that McNair was only on the fringes of United’s Under 21s until Van Gaal trusted him to play. That faith has been repaid.

Full back is slightly different as there is less defensive responsibility. Even so, Dier and Robertson have impressed and Calum Chambers has stood out for Arsenal — it’s easy to forget he’s still only 19.

Tottenham striker Harry Kane, aged 21, has forced his way into the team

Further forward Ryan Mason, 23, and Harry Kane, 21, have forced themselves into the team at Spurs. I like both but it’s interesting to hear Mason say he isn’t a kid any more — his time is now. Players obviously develop at different stages but age should not be a reason to hold anyone back.

We all want to see more youngsters at the top level, especially kids who have come through the academies.This season, at least, we are seeing more of them given a chance.

P.S

It worries me when I see goalkeepers being surprised by conditions on the pitch. They are always the first ones out for the warm up so if they don’t get used to a dodgy surface in the hour before kick off something is wrong. If somebody shoots from outside the box, unless it’s a wonderstrike I expect the keeper to deal with it.
