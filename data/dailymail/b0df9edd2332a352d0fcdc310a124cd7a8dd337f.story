A British banker accused of murdering two prostitutes in Hong Kong tried to kill himself because he was under so much pressure at work, a former girlfriend claimed today.

The woman said Rurik Jutting became depressed after suffering from 'financial problems' and other 'issues' while working for investment bank Merrill Lynch.

He appeared in court today charged with the double murder after the bodies of two sex workers were discovered in his flat in the former British colony in the early hours of Saturday. 

His ex-girlfriend, who did not wish to be named, said Jutting had discussed having suicidal thoughts with her in the past.  

'Insane psychopath': British banker Rurik Jutting has been charged with the murder of two prostitutes found butchered at his Hong Kong flat. He is pictured here with Ariane Guarin, also known as Yanie, who is believed to one of the trader's ex-girlfriends, but not the one making the claims about his attempts to kill himself

She told Channel 4 News: 'Every time we met he was always stressed because of work. He told me that he had financial problems and some issues with stuff. 

'Last October, he told me that he tried to kill himself. I think (it was) because he was under pressure with his job. He was depressed.'

Jutting is accused of killing Indonesian sex workers Sumarti Ningsih and Jesse Lorena after picking them up from clubs in Hong Kong's red light district.

 Three days ago – on Halloween – he updated his Facebook with the words: 'Money DOES buy happiness.' 

The bloodbath has yet to be explained, but Cambridge-educated Jutting's final 'update' to his wealthy friends and family is a small, if baffling, insight into his state of mind around the time of the killings.

The 29-year-old financier with investment bank Merrill Lynch certainly had a taste for the high life. 

He dined with a string of beautiful women in exclusive restaurants across the globe, according to those who know him.

He enjoyed skiing holidays in Courchevel, the Alpine playground for the elite, and when in London he relaxed at a private members' club in Shoreditch.

The son of an engineer father and a nursery teacher mother, Jutting was described by one colleague in Hong Kong as someone who 'talked very loud and made loads of money'.

Earning a six-figure sum as an equity trader and living in luxury in one of the most vibrant cities in the world, Jutting was apparently going from strength to strength.

But for reasons that are unclear, he appears to have mysteriously quit his job in the days around the first murder.

'He always seemed so sad – he never said hello to any of us or smiled,' said an employee who works in the skyscraper where Jutting lives, and who saw him being led away by police at around 4am on Sunday.

Jutting had been in Hong Kong since July 2013, having transferred from Merrill Lynch's London office where he had worked since July 2010, according to his profile on LinkedIn. Prior to that, he worked as a trader in capital markets at Barclays in London.

Once physically fit, Jutting had been a member of the lightweight rowing club and the cross-country running club at Cambridge University, where he studied law and history at Peterhouse College in the mid-2000s.

He was also the secretary of Cambridge University's history society, which is called Clio, whose honorary members include intellectual heavyweights such as philosopher Professor Roger Scruton and the historian Dr David Starkey.

A senior member of the university told the Daily Mail: 'He was a bit of an action man, always on the move. I never heard about him getting into any serious trouble, so this comes as a real surprise.' Prior to Cambridge, Jutting studied at £34,000-a-year Winchester College – motto: 'Manners makyth man'.

One contemporary at the independent boys' school, Thomas MacThomas, wrote on Twitter yesterday: 'So I knew Rurik Jutting when at school. Kinda disturbing. He was quite strange.'

As teenagers, Mr Jutting and his younger brother lived with their parents in a Grade II-listed house in Chertsey, Surrey.

A neighbour there said yesterday the family were 'nice enough' but were 'quiet and kept themselves to themselves'.

After Rurik moved away to Cambridge, his parents, Graham, 53, and Helen, 52, moved to a grand Victorian manor worth £1.1million in the nearby commuter town of Cobham.

The picturesque home, which is set behind wrought iron gates and surrounded by woodland, was the inspiration for Ernest Shepard's illustration of Kenneth Grahame's children's classic The Wind in the Willows.

Mrs Jutting is a teacher who runs Tumble Tots classes for toddlers in Surrey, her husband is an engineer, and they keep bees in their garden.

Their other son, Auryn, 27, attended Oxford Brookes University and is believed to live in Brighton with his girlfriend.

Rurik Jutting (right) was living the high life before he was charged with the murders of two prostitutes today

A man, who was thought to be Jutting's father, looked exhausted as he told reporters yesterday morning: 'Please respect our privacy.'

Prior to his arrest, Rurik Jutting had been in a relationship with an Asian woman called 'Yanie', according to posts on his Facebook page.

He also 'liked' a Facebook page with photos of provocatively dressed Asian women.

In one of his last postings, Jutting seemed to suggest all was well in his world.

He posted a comment, copied from the internet, which read: 'Is 29 the perfect age? I feel more secure, I'm a better friend and I know my limitations. No wonder 29-year-olds are the most popular age group.'

Only hours later, he was phoning the police to allegedly confess to murder.
