Jose Mourinho has rewarded his players with two days off before they start preparations for Wednesday’s Champions League clash with Paris Saint-Germain.

Chelsea have come through a critical period in the fixture list with victory in the Capital One Cup final against Tottenham at Wembley last Sunday and last night’s 1-0 win at West Ham.

Mourinho’s players will return to training at the weekend as the Chelsea manager plots the second leg against Laurent Blanc’s side at Stamford Bridge.

Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic said: ‘We have the great result from Paris but we still have to think about the Champions League because we want to go through.

‘For us as a team it’s very good because we can have time to refresh ourselves and at the same time to work and prepare for the game in every detail. For sure, we will be ready for the game.

‘This is very important and a good thing about this is we can focus 100 per cent on Paris and we are not thinking about anything else.

‘We enjoyed and celebrated the win for the trophy because we deserved that, but we switched off the next morning and we now have the time to recover and think.

‘It’s the Champions League next and we have to be real, real strong and there is no time for big celebrations.’

Chelsea are closing in on their first Barclays Premier League title since Mourinho returned to Stamford Bridge at the start of last season.

They remain five points clear of Manchester City with a game in hand following their 1-0 win at Upton Park on Wednesday evening.

Ivanovic added: ‘We knew what we had to do, we knew it was another final for us after Man City lost a game, it’s for us to keep the big gap and not give them the chance to close the gap again.

‘We are one step closer, but still it’s a long way.’
