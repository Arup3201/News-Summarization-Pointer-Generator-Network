The Astor family name conjures up images of the Gilded Age and one of American’s richest families at a time of great prosperity and optimism for the country, but as these pictures of the family’s 420-acre estate show they and their iconic home have fallen on hard times.

Rokeby in Hudson Valley, New York has been owned by the Astors for nearly 180 years. The 43-room main house was built in 1815 and then added to by every new owner so that it came to represent the classic 'American Gothic style.'

Today it remains home to a slew of less-than-wealthy heirs to the Astor and Livingston fortunes, but looks more like a rundown museum than the home of what was once one of America's richest families.

The Astor family's 420-acre estate has fallen on hard times as the family has run out of money to maintain its upkeep

The Astor family name conjures up images of the Gilded Age and one of American¿s richest families at a time of great prosperity and optimism for the country

Today the house is essentially a shabby shrine to previous generations and a bygone era of outlandish wealth

The house, and sprawling surrounding 
acreage, has been passed down from generation to generation, but as one 
of the current generation has revealed in her new book, the reality of 
living of Rokeby was rather different than the grand facade.

While many assumed the Aldrich 
family, the 10th generation of Astor heirs, were eccentric hippies 
living off trust funds, according to Alexandra Aldrich's fascinating new
 memoir the money had run out long ago.

'I lived a double life,' she has revealed. 'Our poverty was the big secret.'

But, by the time Aldrich was running 
down its hallways, she says 'the Astor money that had supported 
generations of aristocrats, ill-equipped to earn or invest, (was) gone.

The front of the house was a facade, 
where Aldrich's uncle told tours of people a spiel about the Astor 
family's 200-year history.

But, behind the scenes, the home was crumbling. Aldrich and her parents shared three cramped rooms on the third floor.

'I always longed to be rescued,' Aldrich, whose book 'The Astor Orphan' was released on Tuesday, told The New York Post.

She described how she envied the 'simple ranch, prefab houses' of the middle class. 'I wanted to live like them,' she says.

 ancestor William B. Astor became 'the richest man in America' with his 
successful trading of products such as furs, pianos and real estate.

The next generation divided into city and country Astors - the New York Astor line prospered but the country side of the clan did not fare so well.

William B. Astor Sr.'s oldest daughter, Emily, passed away in childbirth and her daughter, Margaret, died of pneumonia at an early age.

When her husband died two years later, their eight children, aged four to 14, became the 'Astor orphans.'

Among them were 'Uncle Willie,' 'Uncle Archie' and 'Uncle Lewis.'

'These
 free-spirited Astor orphans left us, their descendents, our legacy: the
 house, its history, and contents, and a sense of entitlement and 
superiority,' Aldrich writes in her memoir.

But
 after Margaret's death in 1963 Rokeby began to decline and through the 
1980s, when Aldrich was a young girl, the estate continued to fall into 
ruin, partly because it was owned jointly by three decedents.

'Joint
 ownership brought out the worst in everyone,' Aldrich says. 'Everyone 
had different views of what should happen to Rokeby.'

It also suffered without the 25-strong staff it once had dedicated to its upkeep.

Aldrich told The Post the house was divided with where you lived reflecting your status.

Memoir: Astor Orphans by Alexandra Aldrich tells of life inside the family's Hudson River mansion

Her uncle and his family lived in a 
spacious apartment on the first floor while she, her father Ricky, and 
his Polish artist wife Ania were banished to the servant's quarters.

She
 says the lonely squalor of the third floor was startlingly contrasted
 to the grandeur of the rest of the property and she felt ashamed when she climbed the stairs.

She recalls how the roof leaked, the windows were splintered and there wasn’t much heat to speak of.

Often they didn't have the cash to buy food and bartered with neighbors to survive, she revealed.

After boarding school, she moved to Poland then returned to Brooklyn in 1998 where she converted to Orthodox Judaism and she and her husband had a son, Shlomo.

But in 2005, she and her son returned to her ancestral home and lived there for six years.

She says it remains 'dirty and rundown' to outsiders but has drastically improved since she was a young girl.

Her father, now in his 70s, has been the chief caretaker of the property for almost 40 years.

He still lives in an 18-by-11-foot room that hasn't changed a bit, according to The Post.

While a fund exists for ongoing 
restoration and ensuring taxes are paid, the money simply isn’t there to
 update or modernize the property.

Today the house is essentially a shabby shrine to previous generations and a bygone era of outlandish wealth, the main house's grand public rooms are filled with heirlooms.

But Aldrich says, whatever it's condition, her family will never sell the grandiose property.
