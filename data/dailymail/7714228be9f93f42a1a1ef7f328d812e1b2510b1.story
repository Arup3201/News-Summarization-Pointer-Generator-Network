Police have arrested Scott Allen Miller, 42, over the murder of a woman found on Saturday morning in Melbourne. Miller will face court in NSW

Scott Allen Miller, who was identified as the key suspect in the rape and murder of a Melbourne woman will face court in southern NSW, police have revealed.

The 42-year-old homeless man was arrested on the far south coast of NSW on Monday after a national alert was issued by Victorian police.

This follows the discovery of the naked body of a 32-year-old Chinese woman in a Melbourne park early on Saturday morning.

Miller will appear before Bateman's Bay Court on Tuesday, where Victorian police are expected to apply for his extradition.

CCTV footage has emerged which police believe shows Scott Allen Miller chasing the young woman across St Kilda Road into the Melbourne Botanic Gardens.

Police had been searching for Miller since Saturday when he was named as as a suspect in the 'extremely violent' assault and murder of a woman in Melbourne.

He was taken in for questioning over the rape and murder of a woman whose naked body was found by joggers under a tree at Melbourne’s Botanic Gardens on Saturday morning.

The woman is a 32-year-old Chinese national who moved to Australia to work in the hospitality industry.

She has been identified by police and some of her relatives in China have been contacted, but police are yet to forensically confirm her identity and have not released her name.

Homicide Squad Detective Inspector John Potter confirmed on Monday that the woman had been sexually assaulted before she died.

'This is a particularly violent assault on this woman, she has been sexually assaulted and she has been physically assaulted,' Insp Potter said.

Police have no confirmed the cause of death but said the woman died at the scene.

It is believed she was on her way to work at 5.20am on Saturday when she was approached by Miller.

CCTV footage from the morning of the crime shows a woman being chased across St Kilda Road into the Botanic Gardens near the corner of St Kilda Road and Linlithgow Avenue.

Miller had been sleeping rough in the rotunda at the botanic gardens, 200 metres from where the body was found.

Miller was born in the U.S. and once lived in an affluent Perth suburb.

In the 1990s he was a leading figure in the illegal dance party scene in Perth as director of E-Nerve Pty Ltd a company that organised raves, The Age reported.

Earlier this afternoon Homicide Squad detectives appealed for help to identify a second man who was seen out drinking with Miller on the night of the crime and may be able to assist with the investigation.

Police confirmed on Monday evening that the man seen on CCTV footage walking along Swanston Street with Miller about 1.50am on Saturday has now contacted police.

He attended a city police station and made a statement on Monday evening, police say.

Earlier on Monday, Homicide Squad Detective Inspector John Potter urged the man to make contact with police or call Crime Stoppers.

The woman's naked body was discovered in the Royal Botanic Gardens in Southbank

'We do not believe this man was involved in the woman's death, but it's important we speak to him as he may be able to help with regard to Miller’s whereabouts,' Det Insp Potter said.

Miller and the other male were seen entering a licensed premises on Bourke Street between Swanston and Russell streets around 2am, where it's believe they stayed for a number of hours before leaving separately.

Detectives have been told that Miller was asked to leave the establishment around 5am. He is then seen on CCTV shortly after walking south along Swanston Street and across Princes Bridge.

It is believed he approached the victim at 5.20am and chased her into the botanic gardens.

Police say they have connected Miller to several items found at the crime scene.

Miller, who is originally from Western Australia, has been sleeping on the streets of the city for at least six weeks and is known to police in other states, although he does not have a criminal history in Victoria.

While police issued a national alert, they concentrated their search on the Melbourne area. They also engaged transit police and were looking around train stations as Miller is known to travel by train.

Anyone with information about the death is urged to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or visit www.crimestoppersvic.com.au.

Police have not released the woman's name, but say she is a Chinese national who was in her 30s
