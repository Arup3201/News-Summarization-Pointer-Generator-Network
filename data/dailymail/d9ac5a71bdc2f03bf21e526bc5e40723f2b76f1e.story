A giggle, a chuckle or a full-blown guffaw, we’re told laughter is the best way to  deal with the stress and strain life throws at you.

But according to researchers, laughter might not be the best medicine – and could even lead to serious health complications.

Scientists from Oxford University said a woman with racing heart syndrome collapsed and died after getting the giggles.

According to researchers, laughter might not be the best medicine - and could even lead to serious health complications

And laughing 'fit to burst' has been found to cause possible heart rupture, a torn gullet and epileptic seizures.

A quick intake of breath during laughing can provoke an asthma attack, while some people have suffered from incontinence and even hernias.

Clowns were sent into a hospital as part of the research

The paper added: ‘It remains to be seen whether sick jokes make you ill and dry wit causes dehydration.’

During one test clowns were sent into hospitals to entertain patients.

And the results showed a dose of 'genuine laughter' for a whole day could help shed the pounds by burning 2000 calories.

And 36 per cent of would-be mums undergoing IVF treatment got pregnant after a visit from the red-nosed jokers compared to just 20 per cent in a control group.

Tittering was also linked with lowering blood sugar in diabetic patients and reducing arterial wall stiffness, which helps relieve tension.

The researchers say their findings challenge the view that laughter can only be beneficial but do add that humour in any form carries a "low risk of harm and may be beneficial".

The paper was published in the Christmas edition of The British Medical Journal.
