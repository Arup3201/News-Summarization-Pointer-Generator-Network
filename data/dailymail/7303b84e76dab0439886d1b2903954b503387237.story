A British couple are taking legal action against a hotel in the popular Sharm el Sheikh resort in Egypt, after they were left severely ill during their stay. 

Ann Smith, from Chapeltown in Sheffield, claims she fell sick with serious gastric problems  at the Jaz Mirabel Beach resort in June.

She said her husband - who didn't want to be named - was so poorly that he had to be admitted to hospital when he returned home, where it was discovered he had contracted Salmonella.

Lawyers have now stepped in to investigate the cause of their sickness at the resort.

Ms Smith, a 54-year-old nurse, who booked the holiday with tour operator Thomson, said: 'The illness really knocked us for six and we suffered Diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pains.

'It was awful and we were both so lethargic, which meant we just couldn't enjoy the rest of the holiday.

'As the break went on, we noticed how on occasions some food appeared to be left out for long periods of time, and we saw what looked like new food being added to trays with existing food.

Ill: Ms Smith and her husband say they were both signed off work for several weeks following their ordeal

'We also saw the same utensils being used to handle different foods and we sometimes saw birds in and around the restaurant area at the beach bar.

'I visited the resort's clinic for treatment, but both my husband and I needed to see our GP when we got home - he even had to spend a few days in hospital where it was confirmed he had contracted Salmonella.'

The couple were both signed off work for several weeks following their ordeal.

Ann added: 'Being a nurse, there was simply no way I could have gone into work considering what we had been through.

Nightmare: Ms Smith's husband was so poorly that he had to be admitted to hospital when he returned home

'This was supposed to be a relaxing break but just ended being an absolute nightmare.

'You simply do not expect to fall ill when you go on holiday.

'We have instructed Irwin Mitchell to investigate the cause of our illness and to help us get the answers we want about what caused us both to be so ill.'

Expert illness lawyers from Irwin Mitchell have started investigating what happened.

Clare Comiskey, from the firm's international personal injury team, said: 'The first-hand accounts we have heard have raised a number of concerns and also highlight the significant impact that illness of this nature can have on victims – in some cases leading them to develop long-term symptoms which can cause disruption to their work and personal life.

The couple claim they fell ill while staying at the Jaz Mirabel Beach hotel in Egypt 

'We have successfully represented many British holidaymakers with claims for damages for illness following stays at the Jaz Mirabel Beach hotel over recent years.

'We are now making our own enquiries regarding what caused recent guests at the hotel to become so severely ill.'

A spokesman for Thomson said: 'Thomson is sorry to hear that Mr and Mrs Smith have reported that they were unwell after returning from the Jaz Mirabel Beach Resort in June.

'Thomson closely audits all resorts to which we operate to ensure that health, hygiene and comfort levels are maintained in line with industry standards. 

'This resort remains very popular with our customers and scores highly in our customer satisfaction questionnaires.

'As this case is now subject to legal proceedings it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.'
