Andrew Mitchell has complained to the police watchdog about the Metropolitan Police

Britain's top police officer is set to be hauled back for questioning by MPs over claims that Scotland Yard ‘spun’ its Plebgate inquiry.

Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, had promised a ‘ruthless search for the truth’ after officers were accused of trying to frame Andrew Mitchell, the former Cabinet minister.

But now senior Tories have described as ‘disgraceful’ selective briefings suggesting there was ‘no evidence’ of either lying or collusion by the police.

Mr Mitchell was forced to resign as Chief Whip following an altercation in Downing Street in which he was alleged to have called officers ‘******* plebs’ – which he strongly denies.

The force began an inquiry into the officers’ claims and the leaking of police logs backing up their account of the incident to newspapers.

The saga took a further twist late last week when it emerged that police had briefed newspapers on the inquiry before a report about it was handed to the Crown Prosecution Service, and that the investigation exonerated the officers.

On Saturday an angry Mr Mitchell made a formal complaint to the police watchdog over the affair, accusing the Met of a campaign to ‘blacken my name and destroy my career’.

Yesterday, one of his friends, Tory former shadow home secretary David Davis, said the briefings were ‘disgusting and improper’. He continued: ‘These discussions when they go from the Met to the CPS are classified as restricted.

‘To release them, even in an accurate form, would be misconduct in public office. To release a spun variant is extremely bad.

‘The police cannot be judge and jury in their own trial, which is what this is. Who approved these briefings? The behaviour of spinning this is incredible and disgraceful.’

The latest alleged leak causes acute embarrassment for Sir Bernard, amid mounting controversy over his force’s investigation into journalists’ payments to public officials.

This is now targeting police officers 
accused of leaking information to the media even if there is no question
of them being paid.

Last 
week Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick defended the force’s tactics 
in a strongly-worded letter to the Society of Editors.

Yesterday a member of the influential 
Commons home affairs select committee said Sir Bernard should be 
questioned again over the leaks.

James Clappison, a Tory MP, said: ‘We 
had a meeting in January with Hogan-Howe and he said there would be an 
above board process and indicated he took the issue of leaks very 
seriously.

‘I don’t think the leaking of the results has been helpful in creating the impression of a completely above board process.

‘He needs to be recalled and explain what’s happened and he should be as concerned to get to the heart of it as we are.’

Mr
Mitchell has apologised for swearing during the altercation with 
officers from the Diplomatic Protection Group when they asked him to 
take his bicycle via a side entrance at the Downing Street gates last 
September. But he denies using the word ‘plebs’ or saying they should 
‘know their place’.

Three 
officers from the group, which protects government officials, were 
arrested and statements were taken from all 800 members.

In January Sir Bernard told the committee that he had believed the officers without seeing the police log of the incident.

But he said the allegations against them were ‘extremely serious’ and promised ‘a ruthless search for the truth – no matter where the truth takes us’.

Mr Mitchell has now written to Deborah Glass, deputy chairman of the Independent Police Complaints Commission, to lodge an official complaint against the Met.

‘This was an enquiry into a dishonest and illicit attempt to blacken my name and destroy my career,’ he wrote. ‘It would appear that this police enquiry continues precisely that process.

‘I am deeply dismayed that the Metropolitan Police appear to have leaked part of their report prepared for the CPS… and spun it to the advantage of the police officers involved.’

The CPS said: ‘We have received initial papers but we have not received a full file of evidence. We now await the conclusion of the police investigation before considering charges.’
