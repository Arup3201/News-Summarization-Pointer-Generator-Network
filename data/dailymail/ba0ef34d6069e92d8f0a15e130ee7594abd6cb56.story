An 82 year-old man stabbed to death on the driveway of his Cotswold bungalow has been named by neighbours as Dennis Plater.

Detectives are continuing to question a 47 year-old man who was arrested in Southsea, Hampshire, more than 100 miles away from the murder scene.

The body of Mr Plater, who lived alone, was found outside his detached home in Walkley Hill in Stroud on Friday.

Gloucestershire police said a murder inquiry was under way as it was 'now clear' the man died from stab wounds.

The suspect, also from Stroud, was detained at Southsea and remains in custody.

A white forensic tent was erected on the driveway of Mr Plater's home today and police covered the windows of the house with black sheets.

Neighbours said Mr Plater had lived alone since the death of his wife a few years ago. 

One, who wished to remain anonymous, said: 'He was a nice guy. When we saw each other we always said a few words.

'He was quite frail and he lived there with his wife.

'She died three or four years ago and since then I haven't seen much of him. I think they had been together their whole lives.'

Another neighbour added: 'The police have been round a few times to search my garden. I assume they are looking for a knife.

'They have been at it for ages. There is a field behind the house and there was a group walking along it - about five of them in a row.

'It's really sad. Apparently a neighbour found him on the drive.'

She went on: 'It's tragic. This is a peaceful road. There have been a few burglaries but nothing like this.

Police said: 'The dead man's family has been notified and is being supported by family liaison officers as well as being kept informed of the ongoing investigation.' 

The coroner has been informed of the death and a post-mortem examination has been completed, a force spokesman added.

Anyone with information is asked to contact the force on 101 quoting incident number 126 of 7/11/14.

Information can also be given anonymously by contacting the charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
