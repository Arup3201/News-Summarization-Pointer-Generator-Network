Wayne Rooney is a bulldog of a player; he is snarling, growling, teeth baring. He kicks out, stamps, swears into cameras, criticises his own fans. Perfect for a Manchester United captain. No, seriously.

The forward is set to be named as the next man to lead Louis van Gaal's side in what United fans are hoping will be a new era of success.

He would not be the first maverick captain – and if the others are anything to go by it could be just what the club needs.

Captain fantastic: Wayne Rooney is reportedly set to be named Manchester United's new captain

Impressive: Rooney has been given rightful plaudits after a superb pre-season for United

First of many: Can Rooney now go on to become one of United's best players of all time as the skipper

Eric Cantona became the first foreign player to lift the FA Cup as a captain in 1996 when he replaced the injured Steve Bruce. He scored the winning goal against Liverpool then let out an almighty roar as he lifted the trophy above his head.

The following season, he was made club captain by Sir Alex Ferguson. Had he not announced his shock retirement after a year, he may have continued on for many more.

This was a player stalked by controversy. He spat at a Leeds fan in his first season at United, following his switch from the Yorkshire club in November 1992. There is the infamous karate kick on a supporter at Selhurst Park three years later and the horrible stamp on John Moncur.

Yet in equal measures he produced moments of genius. There was the sublime chip against Southampton, the volley against Wimbledon in the FA Cup and the thunderbolt free-kick against Arsenal.

He scored vital goals – a crucial one away to Norwich on the way to winning the title in 1993, two penalties at Wembley in the 1994 FA Cup Final to secure the club's first league and cup double and that winner against Liverpool in the 1996 FA Cup Final.

They won three league titles and two FA cups in the five years he was at the club – including one league title in his final year as captain.

Maverick: Eric Cantona was a phenomenal talent and a huge fans favourite at United

In control: Cantona captained United in the 1996-1997 campaign - his last at the club

Cantona puffed his chest out, raised his collar, strutted on and off the pitch and was a born winner. He was an artist; the football pitch his canvas, the ball his paint brushes and the goalposts his masterpiece. It made him a leader.

Rooney, too, has shown those flashes of brilliance which were so common in Cantona's career. The overhead kick against Manchester City in in 2011, the first-time volley against Newcastle in 2005 seconds after screaming at referee Neale Barry. Rooney has been doing it since the moment he announced himself on the scene aged 16 with that 30-yard curler against Arsenal in 2002.

These are the moments which can fill his team-mates with confidence that their captain can conjure something out of nowhere to drag them back into a tie or win a game at the death.

It was none other than Roy Keane who picked up the mantle from Cantona in 1997. His bullish aggression and flawed genius made him a perfect replacement in Ferguson's eyes.

Legends: Both Roy Keane and Eric Cantona will go down in United folklore for their contributions to the club

Keane missed most of that first season, injuring his cruciate ligament in a tackle with Alf-Inge Haaland, who then stood over Keane and accused him of trying to hurt him. It was a moment he would live to regret.

When Keane returned he led United to the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League treble. He missed the Champions League final after picking up a yellow card for a trip on Zinedine Zidane in the semi-final against Juventus, but that suspension was indicative of his style.

He was another who, throughout all the trophies and silverware, refused to hold back. He entered into a furious row with the club after demanding a new contract only for officials to say season ticket prices went up to fund it.

He launched a stinging attack on fans at Old Trafford after a Champions League match against Dynamo Kiev in 2000. 'Away from home our fans are fantastic,' he said.

'I'd call them the hardcore fans. But at home they have a few drinks and probably the prawn sandwiches, and they don't realise what's going on out on the pitch. I don't think some of the people who come to Old Trafford can spell 'football', never mind understand it.'

Class: Roy Keane led Manchester United to four league titles as captain at Old Trafford

Later in his reign he claimed his team-mates 'forgot about the game, lost the hunger that got you the Rolex, the cars, the mansion.'

He sought his revenge for the clash with Haaland and admitted he intentionally hurt the player when he was sent of for a disgusting knee-high challenge in 2001. 

'I'd waited long enough,' he said afterwards. 'I f****** hit him hard. The ball was there (I think). Take that you c**t. And don't ever stand over me sneering about fake injuries.' He was banned for a further five matches, to add to his initial three.

Amid all the carnage, it didn't stop them winning four league titles, two FA Cups, the Champions League and much more while he was captain.

Rooney has that fire about him and his career is filled with moments of explosive anger, too.

More to come?  Rooney could go on to lift the Premier League title as United captain in the future

Sharp: Rooney will be hoping he can take his game to the next level under Louis van Gaal 

He stamped on Ricardo Carvalho in the 2006 World Cup quarter-final against Portugal then pushed club team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo after being sent off.

He was shown a red card for needlessly kicking Miodrag Dzudovic in England's 2-2 draw with Montenegro in the final qualifier for Euro 2012 and was initially banned for all three of their group matches, although it was later reduced to two.

He has pushed Rio Ferdinand, swore at David Beckham and again at England's entire bench after being substituted in a friendly against Spain then throwing to the floor a red armband worn in memory of the late Emlyn Hughes.

Like Keane, he is not afraid to confront his own fans and criticised England supporters for booing the team off the pitch in their goalless draw with Algeria at the 2008 World Cup. 'Nice to see your home fans boo you,' he raged at a camera beaming back into every home in the country.

As well as that he was banned for swearing into a camera after scoring a hat-trick against West Ham in 2011. It earned him a two-match suspension and he missed the FA cup semi-final.

Even in accepting the ban, he refused not to have the final say. 'I am not the first player to have sworn on TV and I won't be the last,' he said.

'Unlike others who have been caught swearing on camera, I apologised immediately. And yet I am the only person banned for swearing. That doesn't seem right.' Through all the screaming and shouting and scrapping, Rooney could be the perfect captain for United after all.
