When a New York City dry cleaners was destroyed by Superstorm Sandy, the only item to survive was Nicole Pagliaro's wedding dress.

But her name was lost to owner Hector Pacheco, who reopened after more than a year and in a new location.

Mrs Pagliaro had brought the dress to him after her 2012 wedding. When the storm swamped and shuttered the store, on Staten Island's Sand Lane, she assumed it was lost.

Found: Nicole Pagliaro, pictured with her husband Michael (left) and dry cleaner Hector Pacheco (right), has been reunited with her wedding dress that she thought had been destroyed by Hurricane Sandy in 2012

'Every store [on lower 
Sand Lane] was done,' Mrs Pagliaro's husband Michael told the Staten Island Advance. 'When I got home, I showed Nicole the 
pictures and she asked, "What about the dry cleaners?" When I told her, 
she started crying.'

In fact, while the dry cleaning store was flooded by fave feet of water, Mrs Pagliaro's dress, which was stored in a secure box, floated to the surface undamaged.

The ticket attached was lost though, so Mr Pachecho was unable to track down the gown's owner. Instead, when he reopened a year later in a new location, he displayed the dress in the window.

It was not until two weeks ago, that Mrs Pagliaro took a different route to work and spotted the gown in the window of Mr Pacheco's new store.

On show: The gown (pictured) was the only garment to survive when Mr Pacheco's store was flooded. The ticket attached to the dress was lost, so when he opened a new store, he used it as a window display

'We really never drive down this way, and thank God there were no gates on the window,' she said.

'I saw my dress in the window. I knew it was my dress,' 
adding that she even still had the ticket for it.

She says that when she finally went into the shop, on Monday, Mr Pacheco was present.

'He remembered me and gave me a big hug,' she said.

Mrs Pagliaro wants her daughter — now 18 months old — to wear the dress on her wedding day.
