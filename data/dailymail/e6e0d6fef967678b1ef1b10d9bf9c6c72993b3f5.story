Rory McIlroy will continue his pursuit of a first Open title when he tees off at 2.27pm on Friday.

The Northern Irishman will be looking to repeat the stunning round of 66 he produced on the opening day which gave him the outright lead ahead of Italy's Matteo Manassero.

McIlroy will continue playing with Jordan Spieth and Hideki Matsuyama before the cut is officially made ahead of Saturday's third round.
