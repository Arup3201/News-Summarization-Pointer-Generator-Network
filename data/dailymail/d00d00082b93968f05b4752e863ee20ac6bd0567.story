Petr Cech's chances of squeezing out Thibaut Courtois suffered another blow on Thursday night when the new Chelsea No 1 signed a five-year contract.

Chelsea have moved swiftly in negotiations with Belgium goalkeeper Courtois after he returned to Stamford Bridge following three years on loan with Atletico Madrid. His new contract, worth about £100,000 a week, confirms that his long-term future is at Chelsea working with Jose Mourinho.

Courtois started the season ahead of Cech and there appears no way back into the team for the popular keeper. Cech was given permission to leave on transfer deadline day but he opted to stay at Chelsea.

The Czech keeper, 32, has won three Premier League titles and the Champions League with Chelsea but Mourinho is looking to the long-term future.

Courtois, 22, played in Atletico Madrid’s La Liga-winning team last season and was in the side who lost to rivals Real Madrid in the Champions League final.

He signed his new deal after returning from the international break and will face Swansea at Stamford Bridge on Friday.

Courtois said: ‘I’m very happy with this deal, it’s nice to have signed this new contract for five years. My future was already sorted but it’s nice to know that I am going to be here for another five years. Now I can just concentrate on playing games.’

Courtois has conceded four goals in his opening three games since replacing Cech in goal, including three in the remarkable 6-3 win at Everton on August 30.
