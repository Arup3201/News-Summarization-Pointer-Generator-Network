Tyson Fury believes a fight with Deontay Wilder would be even bigger than a clash between Floyd Mayweather Jnr and Manny Pacquiao.

Wilder outclassed Bermane Stiverne in Las Vegas on Saturday night to be crowned America's first heavyweight world champion since 2006.

He immediately targeted a fight with fellow motormouth Fury who admitted he would relish the challenge.

'Wilder did a good job on Stiverne and he's now got the WBC title,' he said. 'That puts him in line for big fights against people like me, Wladimir Klitschko and whoever else.

'America has a new heavyweight champion of the world and the big boys are back in the division. The division has been set on fire again.

'It was definitely the result I wanted. Stiverne, although a good champion, was a bit of an unknown. Nobody knew who he was and nobody cared. Now America has a new heavyweight champion.

'Also, Wilder's undefeated and a knockout artist. That means the division has been given a lift and we're all back in business.

'I don't like Deontay Wilder and he doesn't like me. I think he's a big hype-job.

'We once had a bit of a falling out in Sheffield at one of Mick Hennessy's boxing shows and I told him one day I will get him in the ring and knock him out. That is still my plan.'

Fury is the mandatory challenger to world champion Wladimir Klitschko who holds the three other major belts.

And he believes he will one day be crowned the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world.

'In an ideal world I'd like to fight Klitschko first, because he's got most of the belts and he's the No 1 in the division, and then I'd like to unify all the titles against Deontay Wilder,' Fury added.

'Potentially, I'm three or four fights away from being the unified heavyweight champion of the world.

'It would be the biggest selling fight with the greatest smack talk in heavyweight history.

'No other fight could come close to it. It would be pure entertainment.

Wladimir Klitschko's last bout ended with a fifth-round knockout win over Kubrat Pulev in November 2014

'Back in the (Muhammad) Ali days, there was only one man doing the talking. The others wouldn't talk. This is different, though. We can both talk, we both play the press and we are both natural born entertainers. That's why it's the biggest fight out there as far as I'm concerned.

'It's not just the biggest fight in the heavyweight division, it's the biggest fight in world boxing.

'I'm a big puncher, he's a big puncher, and it's just a matter of who lands first. I wouldn't go out there to try and outbox somebody who is probably quicker than me. I'd go out there to switch his lights off. I'd look to demolish him early.

'There'd be a guaranteed knockout in the early rounds. Either way, it will be over very fast.'
