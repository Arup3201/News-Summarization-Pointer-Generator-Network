Fine: Andrew Gardiner has been convicted of threatening fellow councillor Mike Weston and fined £200

A councillor has been fined for telling an election rival he would 'knock his block off' in a furious rant after losing at the polls.

Andrew Gardiner threatened to kill fellow councillor Mike Welton and jabbed a finger at his face as bystanders looked on.

But despite being convicted of using threatening words or behaviour, he insisted he had 'no regrets' about the incident and refused to resign as a councillor in Wymondham, Norfolk.

Gardiner and Mr Welton both sit as independents on the town council, and were standing for Norfolk County Council during the local elections in May this year.

When Gardiner was defeated by Conservative candidate Joseph Mooney, he launched an angry tirade at Mr Welton, accusing him of deliberately splitting the independent vote to keep him out of office.

The councillor denied using threatening words or behaviour, but was found guilty at Norfolk Magistrates' Court yesterday.

Gardiner, 51, was fined £250 and ordered to pay a £25 victim surcharge plus £200 in costs.

Mr Welton told the court: 'He said I was a disgrace to Wymondham. He told me he was going to get me, he was going to knock my block off.'

Jack Hornby said he was standing with a group of Conservative councillors outside Long Stratton leisure centre, where the vote count took place, at the time of the rant.

He said that Gardiner repeatedly jabbed a finger at Mr Welton, intimidating him and forcing him to step backwards, and added that Gardiner threatened to 'kill' his rival.

Oliver Haswell, prosecuting, said the defendant had 'lost his self-control, reacted appallingly in the circumstances and used threatening abusive words or behaviour towards Mr Welton'.

Gardiner insisted he had been provoked by Mr Welton and said he was under severe stress at the time of the row.

'I had four weeks and a day of being goaded by him,' he told magistrates. 'I had just had pneumonia and a friend had died.

'I was wound up by him. At some point you have to react - I've never turned the other cheek.'

Last night, Mr Welton spoke of his relief that Gardiner had been convicted, saying: 'Threatening behaviour is a very serious offence.

'The verdict sends out a clear message to anyone contemplating this type of behaviour that the authorities will not tolerate it.'

But Gardiner claimed he had done nothing wrong and again blamed his rival for the incident, insisting he would not resign from his position.

'I have always maintained that I did not threaten Mr Welton with violence,' he said. 'I think the magistrates' sentence reflects they did have some sympathy towards me.

'I have no regrets about what I said to Welton. But I deeply apologise to people in Wymondham for allowing myself to be goaded into reacting.'
