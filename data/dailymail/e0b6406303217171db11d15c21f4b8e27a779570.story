It is probably the world’s fastest four-door production saloon – the 200mph Flying Spur.

It is certainly the most powerful ever produced by Bentley.

And, for those who can afford the £140,900 price tag, their children can surf the internet in the back thanks to its built-in wi-fi.

Four-wheel drive: The Flying Spur has a six-litre twin turbo W12 engine which develops 616 brake horse power

The car is due to make its world debut at the Geneva Motor Show on March 5 before going on sale here in early summer.

It is powered by a six-litre twin-turbo W12 engine which develops 616 brake horse-power – the equivalent of six Ford Fiestas. This is coupled to an eight-speed automatic gearbox, enabling the Flying Spur to accelerate from rest to 60mph in only 4.3 seconds.

Length: 17ft/4.5inches

Weight: 3 tons

Seats: 4 or 5 (depending on configuration)

Engine: 6-litre twin turbo-charged W12 (equivalent to six Ford Fiestas)

Gears: 8-speed automatic with F1-stylw manual paddle-shifts

Top speed: 200mph

0-60mph: 4.3sec

Fuel consumption: Averages 19.2mpg

Price: £140,900

 It will hit 100mph in  9.5 seconds – a time that would not disgrace many mainstream cars accelerating to 60mph.

The Crewe-built super-cruiser features four-wheel drive for extra grip and stability and, as it reaches its top speed, the ride height is automatically lowered by its air suspension to make it more aerodynamic and rooted to the road.

But deep pockets will be needed for the fuel bills. The new Bentley averages just 19.2mpg, dropping to just 12.6mpg around town but rising to 27.8mpg when cruising.

Emissions of CO2, the gas blamed for global warming, is a hefty  343g/km – though both this and the fuel consumption represent a 13 per cent improvement on the outgoing model.

Bentley boss Dr Wolfgang Schreiber said: ‘The new Flying Spur is the ultimate luxury performance sedan, equipped both for business and relaxation while remaining a car to enjoy from behind the wheel.’

There’s an 8in touch-screen which links stereo, sat-nav and Bluetooth, with the option of  voice activation, as well as links for iPods.

For chauffeur-driven passengers, the car has its own wi-fi hotspot  so they can connect their laptops and tablets to the internet. Two 10in LCD screens are installed on the backs of the front seats.

Bentley, which employs 4,000 staff at Crewe and is part of the Volkswagen Group, enjoyed a 22 per cent rise in global sales to 8,510 last year. Sales in China rose by 23 per cent to 2,253.
