A mother was left weeping with joy after her severely disabled son spoke his first-ever word after nine years of silence, giving her hope that he might one day utter full sentences.

Lucas Kirby suffers from a rare condition called lissencephaly which means his brain has not developed beyond that of a baby.

His mother Tracie, 45, was warned that he might not live beyond two, but Lucas has defied all the odds and reached his ninth birthday.

The brain condition means that he is confined to a wheelchair and had never spoken a word - until recently.

When Lucas choked on some food and lost consciousness, his mother called 999.

Before they arrived Ms Kirby managed to dislodge the blockage and resuscitate him, but paramedics still arrived to check on him.

Dr Andrew Mason introduced himself to Lucas while he was performing checks and was startled when the boy said his name 'Andy' back to him.

Dr Mason called for Ms Kirby and he repeated the name again.

While Lucas has not said anything since his outburst on March 2, his mother says she now has fresh hope that he might one day be able to talk.

She said: 'My first reaction when the paramedics told me was that they were taking the mickey. Lucas has never spoken because he is so disabled.

'I was just floored, literally floored. One of the rapid response team had to hold me up, I was just sobbing.

'It has definitely given me hope that he will speak again. You have gone from thinking that he is not capable of doing it to seeing and hearing that he is.

'Lucas has gone through so much in such a short life that every day he is exceeding expectations.

'We were told he wasn’t going to live past two and this month he turned nine.

'I have been trying to get him to say "mum" his entire life so it is actually quite annoying.

'Even if he never speaks again, at least I know he can. He’ll always be my little miracle boy.'

Since the incident, Tracie Kirby said she now hopes her son might one day be able to speak more words

Lucas’s Lissencephaly  means he has a 'smooth brain' which doesn’t have the same grooves or ridges as other children’s.

As a result he needs round-the-clock care as regular seizures put him at risk of dying every day.

There is no cure and sufferers rarely live past the age of ten.

Ms Kirby, who looks after him full time at their home in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, added: 'He is just a happy kid.

'They said he wouldn’t show any emotion but he definitely does.

'He doesn’t need to say anything because his facial expressions tell you how he feels.

Lissencephaly, which literally means smooth brain, is a rare brain formation disorder.

It is caused by defective neuronal migration during the 12th to 24th weeks of pregnancy resulting in a lack of development of brain folds and grooves.

The disease can be identified at birth, or soon after, by ultrasound CT or MRI.

Causes can include viral infections of the uterus or the fetus, or insufficient blood supply to the fetal brain early in pregnancy.

'I am proud of him every day. Even with all his issues he is still the best thing I have ever done.

'You go through life with your blinkers on. You don’t think how many disabled children there actually are.

'But Lucas fills me with wonder every day. One of his nicknames is my wonder boy.'

Dr Mason, from Suffolk Accident and Rescue Service, said: 'I walked over to little Lucas and introduced myself.

'When he repeated my name after me, I assumed that it was because his consciousness was improving.

'I told his mum this, only for her to say he couldn’t speak so he can’t have said my name.

'Again I introduced myself and the same thing happened, as clear as anything he said "Andy".

'This time Tracie was there to witness it - and promptly burst into tears.'

Lucas was taken to West Suffolk General Hospital but was soon discharged and is now recovering well at home.

Since the incident the youngster and his mother visited Bury St Edmunds ambulance station to meet the crews and doctor who saved his life.

Andrew Mascall, from the East of England Ambulance Service, was the first paramedic on scene and said Lucas’s first word was a 'wonderful moment'.

He said: 'It was clear Lucas was quite unwell so we immediately started assessing and treating him.

'He was beginning to show signs of improvement when we clearly heard him say "Andy".

'I don’t think I’ve ever seen such a wonderful moment. It was amazing.

'Tracie was bawling her eyes out after hearing her son say his first word ever - though I think she was pretty miffed it wasn’t "Mum".'
