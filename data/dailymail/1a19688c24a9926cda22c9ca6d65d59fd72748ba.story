Monica Lewinsky has condemned the publication of stolen celebrity photographs online last week, that showed the likes of Jennifer Lawrence and Kate Upton in various states of undress.

In an essay penned for Vanity Fair, Lewinsky said she 'felt compassion for these young women.'

'Like so many others, I feel outrage—as a fellow victim, as a civilized individual, and as a woman—when other women are so easily and publicly violated. And I have found myself wondering: Have we become a world of pathetic voyeurs? Are we turning into scruffy old men in dirty raincoats slouched in the back row at the Gotham City theater?' she wrote.

Lewinsky said she 'felt compassion for these young women' whose photos were stolen and published last week

Lewinsky (seen in 1999) also revealed she recently feared her own photos were published - but those images turned about to be fake

Lewinsky also revealed she recently feared her own photos were published, but those images turned about to be fake.

Citing her phone conversations taped by Linda Tripp that later aired on TV, Lewinsky wrote her experience was different from those of the recently-hacked A-listers, but that 'the searing embarrassment and stinging humiliation are still there.'

Lewinsky wrote that '...certainly we can agree that stolen private nudes of actresses (or of anyone, really) is crossing the double yellow line.'

'When you can see hacked, private nude photos, we have crossed a line,' Lewinsky later wrote in her Vanity Fair essay. 'And we’ve been saying this for years, in other contexts, for other transgressions. The line was crossed with paparazzi chasing Princess Diana to her death; with Rutgers student Tyler Clementi’s suicide after having his privacy invaded and paraded; with the hacking of Milly Dowler’s voicemail.'

Lewinsky is not the only celebrity to recently criticize the photos' publication. 

Josh Hutcherson, who stars with Lawrence in 'The Hunger Games' film series, told The Daily Beast this week 'It’s f****n horrible. I haven’t spoken to [Jennifer] since it happened, but as far as the public, Twitter, and media have reacted, it’s awful.'

In a statement to ABC News, the FBI said 'The FBI is aware of the allegations concerning computer intrusions and the unlawful release of material involving high profile individuals, and is addressing the matter. Any further comment would be inappropriate at this time.'
