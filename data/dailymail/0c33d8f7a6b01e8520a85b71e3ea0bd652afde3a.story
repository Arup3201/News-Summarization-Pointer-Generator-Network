Long-time Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward says the Obama administration threatened him in an email by saying he would 'regret' questioning the White House on the origin of the sequestration cuts slated to go into effect Friday.

The investigative journalist, who is famed for his work on the Watergate scandal, revealed details of his exchange with top economic aide Gene Sperling on CNN Wednesday and in an interview with Politico.

He said the email from Sperling made him feel ‘very uncomfortable to have the White House telling reporters that "you’re going to regret doing something."’

Concern: The Washington Post journalist spoke on Wolf Blitzer's 'The Situation Room' Wednesday; officials from the White House declined to appear on the show

The note from Sperling was in reaction to a column by Woodward that was published in the Washington Post last week.

In his article, Mr Woodward – an associate editor at the paper – writes that the president’s decision to hold back on military deployments is ‘madness,’ and says the Obama administration was ‘wrong’ to blame the across-the-board cuts on Republicans alone.

Woodward has previously written that the idea for the sequestration cuts originated with the White House and his assertion has been verified by several congressional officials.

The White House has been emphasizing that Republicans were in agreement with President Obama when Congress approved the across-the-board cuts and Obama signed them into law. The White House also argues that President Obama - as well as Congress - never actually believed the cuts would go into effect, as they were merely a mechanism for forcing Congress' to deal with the budget deficit.

Before publishing the weekend editorial, Mr Woodward had called Sperling to forewarn him about the piece.

He told Politico that Sperling ‘yelled at me for about half an hour’ in a furious tirade.

Sperling later sent Mr Woodward an email apologizing for his actions and his tone of voice over the phone.

'I do understand your problems with a couple of our statements in the fall — but feel on the other hand that you focus on a few specific trees that gives a very wrong perception of the forest,' Sperling wrote. 'But perhaps we will just not see eye to eye here.'

According to Politico, this is the full email exchange between White House economic aide Gene Sperling and Bob Woodward.

From Gene Sperling to Bob Woodward on Feb. 22, 2013:Bob:I apologize for raising my voice in our conversation today. My bad. I do understand your problems with a couple of our statements in the fall — but feel on the other hand that you focus on a few specific trees that gives a very wrong perception of the forest. But perhaps we will just not see eye to eye here.But I do truly believe you should rethink your comment about saying saying that Potus asking for revenues is moving the goal post. I know you may not believe this, but as a friend, I think you will regret staking out that claim. The idea that the sequester was to force both sides to go back to try at a big or grand bargain with a mix of entitlements and revenues (even if there were serious disagreements on composition) was part of the DNA of the thing from the start. It was an accepted part of the understanding — from the start. Really. It was assumed by the Rs on the Supercommittee that came right after: it was assumed in the November-December 2012 negotiations. There may have been big disagreements over rates and ratios — but that it was supposed to be replaced by entitlements and revenues of some form is not controversial. (Indeed, the discretionary savings amount from the Boehner-Obama negotiations were locked in in BCA: the sequester was just designed to force all back to table on entitlements and revenues.)I agree there are more than one side to our first disagreement, but again think this latter issue is different. Not out to argue and argue on this latter point. Just my sincere advice. Your call obviously.My apologies again for raising my voice on the call with you. Feel bad about that and truly apologize.GeneFrom Woodward to Sperling on Feb. 23, 2013:Gene: You do not ever have to apologize to me. You get wound up because you are making your points and you believe them. This is all part of a serious discussion. I for one welcome a little heat; there should more given the importance. I also welcome your personal advice. I am listening. I know you lived all this. My partial advantage is that I talked extensively with all involved. I am traveling and will try to reach you after 3 pm today. Best, Bob

But he added, 'I do truly believe you
should rethink your comment about saying saying that Potus asking for 
revenues is moving the goal post. I know you may not believe this, but 
as a friend, I think you will regret staking out that claim.

'The

big or grand bargain with a mix of entitlements and revenues (even if 
there were serious disagreements on composition) was part of the DNA of 
the thing from the start.'

Woodward responded to Sperling and said there was no need for him to apologize.

'You do not ever have to apologize to
me,' he wrote. 'You get wound up because you are making your points and
you believe them. This is all part of a serious discussion. I for one 
welcome a little heat; there should more given the importance. I also 
welcome your personal advice. I am listening.'

A White House official later said that ‘no threat was intended,’ and that Mr Woodward had likely misinterpreted the conversation.

'The email from the aide was sent to apologize for voices being raised in their previous conversation,' a White House official told Reuters. 'The note suggested that Mr. Woodward would regret the observation he made regarding the sequester because that observation was inaccurate, nothing more.'

Weighing in on the scuffle on Twitter Wednesday, former Obama adviser David Plouffe sniped that Woodward was past his prime as a reporter.

'Watching Woodward last 2 days is like imagining my idol Mike Schmidt facing live pitching again. Perfection gained once is rarely repeated,' Plouffe wrote.

Neera Tanden, a former Obama campaign adviser, added via Twitter, 'My amateur advice: stop cooperating with Woodward in the first place.'

Mr Woodward had attacked the president earlier Wednesday for drawing the nation’s security into the budget debate.

‘So we now have the president going 
out (saying): “Because of this piece of paper and this agreement, I 
can’t do what I need to do to protect the country.”

'That’s a kind of madness that I haven’t seen in a long time,’ he said on MSNBC’s ‘Morning Joe.’

He also wrote in his column over
the weekend that the spending cuts were the original brainchild of the 
White House - a point which Mr Obama originally denied, though the 
administration later confirmed.

The Pentagon had announced earlier this month that it was postponing the deployment of the USS Harry Truman to the Middle East because of funding issues.

Likewise, Mr Obama said yesterday that maintenance work to the USS Abraham Lincoln had been delayed due to the budget crisis.

The $85million sequester was mandated by Congress in conjunction with the White House as part of the August 2011 deal to avoid a government shutdown. The reductions are split between defense spending and domestic programs.

Mr Woodward gained notoriety for his original reporting in the 1970s, exposing the scandal that eventually resulted in President Richard Nixon’s resignation.
