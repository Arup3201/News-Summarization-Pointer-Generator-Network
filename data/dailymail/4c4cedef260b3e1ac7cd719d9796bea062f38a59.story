A zombie cat who 'rose from the dead' five days after being hit by a car and buried has taken his first bite of food since crawling out of a Florida grave.

Bart, a black and white cat from Tampa, immediately returned to the home of his shocked owner Ellis Hutson on January 21.

The nearly two-year-old pet was then taken to the Tampa Bay Veterinary Emergency Service where he had his eye removed and jaw repaired.

Bart the 'zombie cat' who was run over by a car only to inexplicably return from the dead five days later took his first bite of food on Tuesday, two weeks after he rose from the grave

Because Bart can't eat enough to sustain himself, he will remain on a feeding tube for a few more weeks. He is expected to make a full recovery

Bart is expected to make a full recovery and is starting to eat on his own.

Because he can't eat enough to sustain himself, however, he will remain on a feeding tube for a few more weeks, according to the Tampa Bay Times.    

Unable to afford the fees for Bart's operation, Hutson, 52, had reached out to the Humane Society of Tampa Bay. 

Through the Save-A-Pet Medical Fund they were able to help cover costs of surgery on brave Bart who had been through quite an ordeal.

But the organization does not plan on returning Bart to his owner, and it has not decided how or when it will put the cat up for adoption.

Bart, a black and white cat from Tampa, Florida, had surgery to repair injuries at the Tampa Bay Veterinary Emergency Service in January

Huston was unable to afford fees for Bart's operation, so he reached out to the Humane Society, who now plan on not returning the cat 

'Recently we have learned new information about Bart's home environment and the circumstances leading up to his burial,' a statement from the shelter said. 

'Therefore, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay does not intend to return Bart to the Hutson family. 

'We are prepared to fight for the best interests of this cat.' 

The news of his amazing survival made headlines across the world - and Bart may soon be as famous - and financially rewarding - as Grumpy Cat.

Hutson previously told ABC News he was devastated when he had to bury the animal.

The cat boasted gruesome injuries after his return, and has had surgery to remove his eye and repair his jaw

He said he was shocked after Bart showed up back at home five days after an apparently fatal accident. 

Hutson had found his pet in a pool of blood in the street, not moving, after a collision in January.

Vets were baffled by Bart's mysterious survival - but Hutson believes his revival may be the doing of the cat's brother and playmate.

Speaking to local news station Fox13 about the strange happening, he suggested that Bart's friend may have gone looking for him and clawed him out of his resting place.

Bart was buried in this shallow hole not far from his home. He managed to dig himself out and return to his home

Experts believe Bart rose from the grave not long after being buried there - but was scared so stayed away from home for several days

He said: 'We have two cats and they play together all the time and they roam around with each other.

'He might have went looking for his brother and dug him up - but I have no idea'.

The mystery deepened when Hutson revealed that he was so upset by his pet's apparent demise that he did not bury Bart himself - but asked his friend David Liss to do the deed.

Liss said he had no idea how Bart could have been alive. 

He told Fox13: 'I looked at it, and I looked at it, and I didn't see the chest moving up and down or anything and I said, "you know, well look at the blood, it's dead."'
