A member of the grand jury that declined to indict the Ferguson police officer who fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown asked a federal court Monday to remove a lifetime gag order preventing jurors from discussing the case.

The American Civil Liberties Union filed the lawsuit on behalf of an unnamed juror who wants to speak about the investigation but would be in violation of Missouri law by doing so.

The lawsuit also questions St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch's characterization that 'all grand jurors believed that there was no support for any charges.'

Misleading? The American Civil Liberties Union filed the lawsuit on behalf of an unnamed juror who wants to speak about the investigation but would be in violation of Missouri law by doing so. The juror also claims prosecutor Bob McCulloch misled the panel in Darren Wilson's favor

The suit was filed against McCulloch, who oversaw the investigation, because his office would be responsible for bringing charges against the juror, according to the ACLU.

McCulloch's spokesman, Ed Magee, said his office had not seen the lawsuit and declined immediate comment.

'Right now there are only 12 people who can't talk about the evidence out there,' ACLU attorney Tony Rothert said. 'The people who know the most — those 12 people are sworn to secrecy. What (the grand juror) wants is to be able to be part of the conversation.'

The suit does not seek to allow grand jurors in all Missouri cases to be free to discuss proceedings. But it argues that the Ferguson case was unique, and that allowing the juror to speak would benefit the national debate about race and police tactics that was sparked by the shooting.

Brown, who was black, was unarmed when he was fatally shot after a confrontation in August with then-Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, who resigned from the department late last year.

How many jurors serve on a Missouri grand jury?

Twelve jurors serve on a Missouri grand jury panel. 

How many votes are needed to indict? 

In order for a grand jury in the state of Missouri to indict, nine out of 12 jurors must vote to 'hand up' the case.

Whose ultimate decision is it for a case to move forward? 

Only the jury may choose to indict. However, the prosecuting attorney's wish to (or not to) indict is extremely influential.

Per Richard Kuhns of Washington University Law School:

'The prosecutor typically has de facto control over the grand jury. Except for usually minimal instructions from the judge, the prosecutor is the only person the grand jury deals with. 

'The grand jury can decide to call witnesses on its own, but that doesn't happen often. Usually the grand jury is pretty subservient to the prosecutor. If prosecutor wants an indictment, he can almost always get it.'

Is a prosecutor required to hold a grand jury?

No. Grand juries are only guaranteed under the constitution in federal cases. A prosecutor may choose to forgo the process if he/she has probable cause.

However, around half of high-level felonies and nearly all police-involved shootings go through the process.

Who gets to present evidence?

The only lawyer who presents evidence to the grand jury is the prosecutor.

What's more, he or she has almost unrestricted control of what evidence is presented to the jury. 

The prosecutor is the only lawyer in the room in an official capacity during the proceeding.

Withheld evidence? St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch takes questions after announcing the grand jury's decision not to indict Darren Wilson. A lawsuit filed by the ACLU on Monday on behalf of one of the jurors claims the prosecutor released some evidence presented during the hearing but mischaracterized it as all the evidence

Shooting: Officer Darren Wilson shot Michael Brown dead in August. A suit filed on behalf of a grand juror in the case alleges the prosecutor in the case Bob McCulloch blamed Brown in the shooting as he handled the case differently from the countless others they'd seen

The shooting led to widespread unrest in an around the St. Louis suburb, including some protests that resulted in local business being burned and looted. Protests again turned violent on Nov. 24, when McCulloch publicly announced that the grand jury investigating the case had decided there wasn't enough evidence to indict Wilson.

The grand jury — which included nine white people and three black individuals — met on 25 separate days over three months, hearing more than 70 hours of testimony from about 60 witnesses. Those witnesses included medical examiners and experts on blood, toxicology and firearms, according to McCulloch.

The grand juror behind the lawsuit believes 'the current information available about the grand jurors' views is not entirely accurate — especially the implication that all grand jurors believed that there was no support for any charges,' the lawsuit contends. 'Moreover, the public characterization of the grand jurors' view of witnesses and evidence does not accord with Plaintiff's own.'

Rothert, the ACLU attorney, noted that the grand jury convened in May and heard hundreds of other cases before devoting its attention to the Wilson case in August. 

Protest: Widespread demonstrations swept America under the 'hands up, don't shoot' slogan following the slaying of Michael Brown, who was unarmed

The suit contends that McCulloch's office handled the Wilson case far differently than the others, with 'a stronger focus on the victim.' 

The suit also contends that legal standards were discussed in a 'muddled' and 'untimely' manner.

He also said the Ferguson case was unique in how it sparked a national debate.

'The Supreme Court has said that grand jury secrecy must be weighed against the juror's First Amendment rights on a case-by-case basis,' Rothert said. 'The rules of secrecy must yield because this is a highly unusual circumstance. The First Amendment prevents the state from imposing a lifetime gag order in cases where the prosecuting attorney has purported to be transparent.'

Jim Cohen, associate professor at Fordham University Law School and a grand jury expert, said the lawsuit will add to concerns about how the case was handled.

"Believe me, there's already more than a fair amount of skepticism about whether this process was fair, notwithstanding Mr. McCulloch's cynical attempt to pretend that it was fair," Cohen said.

Cohen believes the juror has a strong argument in the lawsuit.

"This matter has been discussed by virtually everybody in the universe with the exception of any person actually subjected to the presentation of evidence," he said.

Last month, state Rep. Karla May, a St. Louis Democrat, asked a joint House and Senate committee to investigate whether McCulloch "manipulated" the grand jury. It wasn't clear if the committee would take up that request. Messages were left Monday with May and state Sen. Kurt Schaefer, the committee's chairman.
