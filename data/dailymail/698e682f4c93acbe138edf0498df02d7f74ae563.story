Once they lived in the splendour of a £2million country house in the Cotswolds, with a Ferrari, Bentley and BMW in the garage.

These days property developers Michael and Carol Ann Gatt are effectively penniless.

The couple lost their business, their home and almost everything they owned because of what they say was a simple banking error.

They are suing Barclays for more than £3million for bringing them to ‘complete ruination’.

Millionaire property developers Michael and Carol Gatt, who are suing Barclays for £3m after claiming a banking mistake resulted in them losing their business and country home

The Gatts, both 65, claim the bank wrongly told credit reference agencies that Mr Gatt was over his agreed overdraft limit, ruining their credit rating and killing their business.

GLN Holdings Ltd, the Tunbridge Wells-based development company they ran for 22 years, subsequently collapsed.

The couple, who have been married for 44 years, were forced to sell their home, Melksham Court, at a loss. Much of their furniture was sold off as well as their fleet of luxury cars.  They had to move into a bungalow owned by their son on the boundary of the Melksham Court estate in Stinchcombe, near Dursley, a stone’s throw from their former home.

Mrs Gatt burst into tears at the High Court as she accused the bank and its ‘premier relationship manager’, Mark Williams – who deny any wrongdoing – of ‘incorrect and disgraceful actions’.

She said she and her husband shared ownership of their home and assets as they ‘now share the devastation caused by the actions of Barclays Plc and Mr Williams’. Mrs Gatt told the court that in 2007 Barclays had provided credit reports to reference agencies stating the Gatts were £260,000 overdrawn on a limit of £1,500.

But the bank had agreed to let them have the money, she told Judge Patrick Moloney QC, and so was guilty of ‘negligent misstatement’ and ‘defamation’.

Mr Gatt told the court he had a good relationship with Barclays for many years.

He had often asked for more money on his overdrafts, living off borrowings as it was cheaper than taking profit out of the business. ‘They kept lending money and lending money, with no moans about it,’ he told the court.

‘I’m an entrepreneur and property developer, not a bank clerk.’

Mrs Gatt said they would have taken steps to rectify it if they had been told they were over the overdraft limit.

Rupert Allen, representing the bank and Mr Williams, said Mr Gatt was using a temporary overdraft. When the time limit ran out and it was not paid off, it became unauthorised, he said.

The hearing continues.
