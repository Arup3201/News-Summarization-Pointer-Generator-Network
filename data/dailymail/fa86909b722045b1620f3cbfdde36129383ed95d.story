Miracle: Olivia Gilbert, 36, and her seven-year-old son Samuel, who almost crushed by a tree yesterday

As a huge, falling tree crashed down towards their car in the darkness of the storm, Olivia  Gilbert and her seven-year-old son Samuel seemed certain to be crushed.

Incredibly, both walked away from the wreckage without a scratch.

Yesterday, Mrs Gilbert, 36, described her overwhelming sense of relief that she and her child were still alive after the most devastating storm in more than a decade brought chaos to Britain.

Mrs Gilbert, 36, and Samuel were trapped when their Citroen was crushed in the the hurricane-force winds that battered Britain yesterday.

Samuel was sitting in the front alongside his mum when the tree 
smashed down on the roof and crashed onto the back seat in Ipswich, 
Suffolk.

But they escaped unscathed as howling gales left a trail of destruction across the country and claimed the lives of at least five people.

In this case were rescued by quick-thinking dock worker Dennis Green, 60, after the horrific accident at about 8.15pm.

Mr Green said he did not even realise initially that there was a car underneath the massive tree as winds buffeted East Anglia.

The incident occurred as Mrs Gilbert drove Samuel to his grandparents' home nearby.

She had slowed down because another driver was turning around in the road.

'I was crawling at two to three miles an hour and that was when the tree fell on us,' she said.

'I just didn't see it coming. I just heard an enormous bang and it went all dark.

'I rang 999, but I couldn't hear them because the wind was so loud.

'It was then I realised the windows were smashed.'

Escape: Olivia and Samuel were in the front of their Citroen C4 but thankfully the tree crushed the rear seats

Remarkable: At first the car was so swamped that passers-by failed to realise instantly that it was under this huge tree in Suffolk

Smash: A hero helped drag the mother and son from the wreckage of the car and the pair are lucky to be alive

She added: 'Samuel was so calm and brave. We are both so, so lucky to be alive.

Victim: Bethany Freeman, 17, died being comforted by her mother after a tree crashed through her caravan and crushed her while she slept in her bed in Kent

'I am just thankful Samuel was in the passenger seat beside me because if he was in the back I dread to think what the outcome would have been.

'The policewoman who was there afterwards said she couldn't understand how we both walked away.'

Hero passer-by Mr Green said: 'I thought the car might catch fire so I smashed the passenger window.

'I tried the doors but I couldn't get them to open.

'I pulled the young boy out and passed him to other people - then I leaned in and dragged the mother out.'

But modest Dennis insisted he was no hero after pulling off the dramatic rescue, adding: 'I think anyone would have done the same,' he said.

But Mrs Gilbert declared: 'I'm very grateful to him - he was fantastic.'

During yesterday morning, winds of up 
to 100mph swept through the South West, South, South East, the Midlands 
and the East of England after first hitting land in the early hours.

Up
to 2.4 inches of rain - half the monthly average - fell in a just few 
hours during the storm in areas including Hampshire and Devon causing 
flash floods.

The 
devastating storm left Bethany Freeman crushed as a 30ft tree fell on 
the caravans she and her family were living in while renovation work was
taking place at their home at Edenbridge in Kent shortly after 7am.

'Loving
husband' and father-of-three Donal Drohan, 51, originally from 
Waterford in Ireland, died after his car was hit by a tree at the bridge
over the River Colne in Watford.

Victim: 51-year-old Donal Drohan from Harrow, who died today after being crushed in Watford

Mr
Drohan, from Harrow, west London, was 'in the wrong place at the wrong 
time' when his car was struck by a falling tree at Lower High Street.

In
Hounslow, west London, three houses were completely destroyed and two 
more were damaged by an explosion, thought to have been caused by a 
ruptured gas main.

Officers
were called to Bath Road at around 7.30am and they found the bodies of IT contractor Suhail Akhtar, 46, and his 35-year-old girlfriend Dorota Kolasinska in the wreckage.

The explosion on Monday morning was so fierce it wiped out two houses either side of the couple's own home and damaged two more in their street.

Three other people were injured in the explosion, one of whom remains in hospital.

Mr Akhtar, an IT contractor who had worked for services company Atos, and Ms Kolasinska, understood to be a traffic light sequencer for Hackney Council, were found by specially trained sniffer dogs on the first floor of 47 Bath Road.

Close friend Sheldon Hawkshaw, 42, said he was 'in shock'. Mr Hawkshaw, who also works in IT, said: 'I spoke to him nearly every day.

'We went skiing together, motorcycling every weekend - he was very active, always in the gym.

'He was a go-to guy. He always had time for everyone, he was a great friend to us. He always made us laugh and will be sorely missed.'

STRONGEST WINDS1)    Needles Old Battery, Isle of Wight – 99mph2)    Langdon Bay, Kent – 82mph3)    Isle of Portland, Dorset – 81mph4)    Andrewsfield, Essex – 79mph5)    Odiham, Hampshire – 78mph

Mr Akhtar, who owned the house, is believed to have been in a relationship with Ms Kolasinska for around 10 years.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said next of kin had been informed, and it was now waiting for a post mortem examination to be carried out.

Chief Superintendent Carl Bussey said: 'I would like to offer my condolences to the family of the deceased.'

Met Office spokeswoman Laura Young warned that the impacts from the storm are still around and urged the public to remain alert.

Meanwhile at least 61,000 households are still 
without power today as Britain began to recover after the deadly 
ten-hour St Jude's storm tore through leaving a trail of destruction.

Engineers
have worked through the night to reconnect 100,000 homes in southern 
counties after the hurricane-force winds wrecked cables and pylons.

Police officers frantically run down the street at the scene of the devastating gas explosion, which was caused by a tree falling down in heavy wind

The
gusts of up to 99mph left 600,000 properties without electricity, but 
around 10 per cent are still without, with some residents complaining 
there has been a lack of information about when they will be 
reconnected.

Hundreds of villagers in Great 
Bardfield, Essex, have been without power since 7am yesterday, forcing 
them to use candlelight and gas stoves overnight.

'I
would have liked an update from the power companies so we could tell 
people when they will be getting it back, but sadly I've been unable to 
do that,' chair of the parish council Janet Dyson said.

Power companies have said they are not sure when the affected homes will
have access to power again as they deal with each case on an individual
basis.
