Australian comedy duo Kate McLennan and Kate McCartney have road-tested the Termomix as part of their spoof cooking series 'The Katering Show', with hilarious results.

In the video, which has been viewed more than 500,000 times in the past week, the McLennan and McCartney attempt to show off the $2,000 Thermomix in their own comedic way by making risotto - or in their words 'wet dinner porridge'.

According to the women, a Thermomix is 'something you buy because you've always wanted to join a cult, but don’t have the energy for group sex’ or it's 'the kind of a appliance that your rich mother-in-law gives you as a wedding gift, because she doesn't think you can cook'.

The video, which reviews how long it takes to make risotto using the Thermomix as opposed to the traditional method, has already received over 500,000 views

McLennan appears as an old-fashioned cook in the mock video, using her own appliances which turn out to be her kitchen and her saucepans.

On the other hand, McCartney throws a mishmash of ingredients into the Thermomix in the space of a few minutes and relaxes with a bottle of wine.

The Thermomix has become a staple in Australian kitchens. It's famous for it's ability to create a full meal out of a plethora of ingredients.

It's a blender, steamer, chopper - and according to McCartney, it's a 'gang-bang of appliances that's created a futuristic robot saucepan'.

'It’s like an IVF baby that ends up being a psychopath - you have no choice but to love it,' McCartney says in the video, referring to its $2000 price tag.

Sixteen minutes later, while McLennan is still sautéing her onions, McCartney’s Thermomix pings in the background, signifying that her risotto is done.

According to the two Kates, a Thermomix is 'something you buy because you've always wanted to join a cult, but don’t have the energy for group sex’ or it's 'the kind of a appliance that your rich mother-in-law gives you as a wedding gift, because she doesn't think you can cook'

While McCartney's rice warms 'in a $300 bowl', McLennan is still slaving over the stove. Ninety minutes later, looking frazzled, McLennan's risotto is finally ready to be served.

Sitting down to taste their delights, the two women come to the conclusion that neither of them actually like risotto and head off to finish off the bottle of wine instead.  

Some 80,000 Thermomix devices were sold in Australia in 2014 - despite an angry backlash from customers upset that the first model released in years, the TM5, allegedly went to market without warning.

The device is also popular in Europe.
