Hospital patients are claiming they were left freezing on a cold dialysis ward for two weeks after a boiler broke down.

Pensioner Reg Hansell said he and fellow kidney patients had been forced to wrap up in hats and scarves to keep warm after suffering 'unacceptable' temperatures in the Thomas Becket Unit at Kent and Canterbury Hospital.

The 70-year-old said up to 40 patients were encouraged to bring in extra duvets and blankets to ward against the cold, which dropped to 15C, and that staff were left shivering when they were told they could not wear extra layers.

Mr Hansell, a former council leader, was diagnosed with kidney failure four weeks ago and has dialysis treatment three times a week.

He said: 'Dialysis is not a pleasant experience and to endure the cold for four hours at a time in those conditions was uncomfortable to say the least.

'Some of the patients who come in for dialysis are quite frail and it was tortuous for them because it was freezing. Visitors complained about it too.

'The hospital claims the ward was kept at 22 degrees but that's rubbish. My house is kept at that temperature so I know what it feels like and it was definitely much colder - more like 15 degrees.

'My nose was cold and I even considered wearing a balaclava. Some patients even brought in duvets.

'I don't blame the nurses, who were cold themselves and had to give out extra blankets and suggested we bring in our own fleeces.

Finbarr Murray, director of Kent and Canterbury Hospital Trust's Estates and Facilities, said the ward is now back to its usual temperature

'I felt awful for them, they started to wear cardigans but were told they couldn't wear them, I think because of germs.'

Mr, Hansell, a retired engineer and ex-leader of Dover District Council, has now received an apology from the ward manager Lesley Alexander this week.

The hospital has confirmed the temperature is  back to normal but bosses refused to accept the temperature had dropped lower than 20C.

Finbarr Murray, director of the Hospital Trust's Estates and Facilities, said: 'We are sorry that our patients in the Thomas Becket Unit at Kent and Canterbury Hospital have been inconvenienced by one of the two heaters serving the unit becoming faulty.

'Renal patients require a higher room temperature whilst undergoing dialysis for four to five hours, three times a week.

Mr Hansell has now received a letter of apology from after he complained dialysis patients were left to suffer 'freezing' conditions although the hospital says the  temperature did not drop below 20 degrees

'Our staff have been helping our patients to keep warm during their dialysis with the help of additional blankets for a few days whilst alternative heating was arranged.

'A second boiler has continued to be operational during this time maintaining a temperature of at least 22 degrees with the assistance of portable electric heaters, increasing the temperature of the underfloor heating and turning off of the cold airflow system.

'Our Building Management System sounds an alarm if the temperature drops to 20 degrees or below, which has not happened during this time.

We keep spare parts for all our critical equipment; however parts for these boilers must be fitted by a specialist Gas Safe registered engineer which has been the cause of this delay.

'The ward is now back to its usual temperature. We have not received any formal complaint regarding this.' 

But Mr Hansell, who used to manufacture boilers, claimed the hospital did not have the necessary spares which was why patients had to suffer the cold conditions for two weeks.

'That's no way to run a hospital,' he added. 'The question now is will the hospital buy spares for the next time this happens?.'
