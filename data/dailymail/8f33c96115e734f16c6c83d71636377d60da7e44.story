This shocking array of firearms is just part of the terrifying arsenal of weapons seized by a police force in just the last year.

The deadly haul of guns collected from the streets of the West Midlands include an Uzi, AK47 and an exact replica of the handgun used by Saddam Hussain.

The myriad of over a hundred fierce firearms - some of which are modified or homemade - have been seized by, or been surrendered to, West Midland’s Police over the last 12 months.

Which one is real? An example of how alike replica and real guns can be - on the left is a replica BB gun while on the right is the real police issue 9mm self loading pistol. Both have been seized by West Midlands Police

The cache of weapons are now being contained within a secure unit at a secret location by the force and are being used to train firearms officers.

Pc Rob Pedley, a former firearms officer for 11 years, said: 'We obtain the guns through a variety of sources, many are seized but some are surrendered and handed in through amnesty’s and via other means.

'Some people have legitimately held licenses for rifles and decided to get rid of them - others we can perhaps connect to crimes or planned crimes.

'But each gun can be dangerous when in the wrong hands and we need to continually remind people of that fact.

'As a firearms officer, you have to very quickly assess situations and decide what the correct response is.

'It’s very difficult to know whether a firearm someone is in possession of is genuine or an imitation, and it is even more difficult when think about the fact that it could be pitch black and the person holding that weapon could 50 yards or more away.'

The force said yesterday said that imitation guns, easily sought for just a few pounds from a variety of websites, can even be as dangerous as the real thing.

Chief Inspector Paul Minor, head of the force’s firearms unit, added: 'The perception of firearms units may be weapons and fast cars but in reality it can be a lonely place.

'Sometimes officers need to make split-second decisions and decisions that could have catastrophic consequences.

'Our officers are trained to an exceptionally high standard by experts with many years firearms tactical experience; that’s why I’m confident that in the vast majority of incidents they will make the right decision.'
