A Harvard University student publication offended many Jews this week by publishing an anti-Semitic article on their website.

The Harvard Ichthus, a Christian journal, published an essay by a Jewish convert to Christianity called 'Why Us?' which purports that the Jews deserved to suffer for killing Jesus.

'We, the Jews, collectively rejected God and hung Him up on the cross to die, and thus we deserved the punishments that were heaped on our heads over the last 2000 years,' the anonymous contributor wrote.

The article was initially published on Wednesday, but pulled down, edited and re-posted Friday morning.

It has since been permanently removed from the site and replaced with an apology from the editor in chief, Aaron Gyde.

Fallout: The anonymous author of the blog post titled 'Why Us?' is a Jewish convert to Christianity. He wrote that the Jews deserved 2000 years of suffering for killing Jesus. The post has since been deleted from the site

'We apologize for publishing offensive content on our blog,' Gyde wrote. 'It was not the intent of the writer, nor the Ichtus, to present a piece that is anti-Semitic in nature or in interpretation. The writer holds nothing but love for his heritage and feels very deeply for the welfare of the Jewish people.'

Gyde adds that the subject matter of Christianity may be controversial for non-believing readers, but that the specific post was offensive outside the realm of religious discourse.

'We do acknowledge that many of the claims of Christianity are offensive to those who do not believe it, but we think that much of the offense that has resulted from this article is not the offense of the gospal of Jesus Christ and for that we apologize.'

Harvard issued a statement Saturday, saying it does not endorse the views of any of the school's organizations.

A spokesman added that it was the organization's decision to pull the post and apologize.
