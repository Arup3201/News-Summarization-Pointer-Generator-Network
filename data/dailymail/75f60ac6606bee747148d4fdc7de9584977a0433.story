Two men have been charged with robbing the exclusive Dorchester Hotel in a smash-and-grab raid this week.

Unemployed brothers Reed Roberts, 23, and Skye Roberts, 19, appeared at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court in London today in the wake of the moped robbery at the five-star hotel.

It is the second time in a month the hotel has been raided. In the latest attack a gang of six men on three mopeds pulled up outside  in the early hours of this morning.

Three of them then smashed their way through the front door and broke into display cabinets.

Both brothers, from King's Cross, north London, were charged with robbery and possession with intent to supply a Class B drug.

They are set to appear at Kingston Crown Court on July 25. Another two men and a woman have been arrested and bailed. 

The luxury venue was hit in exactly the same way last month, when watches and jewellery were stolen in what police called a 'well-planned' heist.

Police have yet to reveal the value of items stolen but it is thought it could run into many thousands of pounds.

A guest at the hotel on Park Lane, said: 'I woke up early, so I went down to the lobby at about five, maybe six in the morning.

'There was quite a bit off commotion. Police were there and speaking to the staff and it looked as if a few things had been smashed.'

During the first raid in June, three of the gang were spotted waiting outside the hotel on their bikes

She added: 'Apparently, one of the doors had been smashed but it was being cleared up and there was a screen around it.

'We
 had been told that there was an incident, but nobody was hurt and the 
police had it under control. But I spoke to another guest who said the 
people who smashed it were driving mopeds, or motorbikes.'

A spokeswoman for the hotel said: 'We can confirm there was an incident at the hotel early this morning and we are assisting the authorities with their inquiries.

'The hotel security team were quick to respond and no-one was hurt. The comfort and security of our guests and staff is our top priority.'

On June 10, a gang of six men pulled up on three mopeds outside hotel at around 1.30am.

On that occasion, they smashed five glass display cases in the foyer and stole watches and jewellery worth tens of thousands of pounds.

As the gang escaped last month, one of the bikes hit a 25-year-old woman in nearby Cambridge Circus, leaving her with leg injuries that required hospital treatment.
