It's the product of 520 metres of tin 
foil, 580 plastic cups, 62 litres of water and a whole lot of time to 
kill that only students could enjoy.

Business undergraduate Jake Walker 
returned to his room after a week away to find his housemates had 
covered everything, from his surfboard to his lacrosse sticks, in 
aluminium wrapping.

For good measure, the pranksters had 
also placed hundreds of cups filled with water on the floor, making the 
room look more like a bizarre lunar module than a student's sleeping 
quarters.

'I was absolutely gobsmacked. I was in so much shock,' the 19-year-old Plymouth student told MailOnline.

It's a wrap! Plymouth student Jake Walker came back to his digs after a week away to find his housemates had covered everything in his bedroom in tin foil as a practical joke

Prank patrol: Six of Jake's housemates spent four days wrapping everything from his DVDs to his fruit bowl and bed stead while he was away at home for the week

Tools of the trade: The students used 520 metres of tin foil and yards of Cellotape for the prank

Glaringly obvious: Jake's housemates have a history of practical jokes so he made sure to lock his door not knowing they had secretly propped his widnow open

'It had taken me more than four hours to drive back so I was pretty exhausted.

'It took me hours to take it all the 
foil down and it was quite a job emptying all the cups. I still haven't 
got rid of them all.'

The prank was conjured up by his seven housemates when Jake had gone home to Guildford for a week earlier this month.

As they have a history of playing 
practical jokes on each other, Jake made a point before leaving of gleefully telling 
them that he had locked his bedroom door.

Before and after: The pranksters also filled the room with 580 plastic cups filled with water for good measure

Work in progress: Some of the housemates worked on covering the walls while the others wrapped individual items like his fruit and DVDs

Gutted: Jake even sent his mates a text saying 'bad luck!' thinking they couldn't get into his room

Mammoth effort: Among the items they wrapped were his computer monitor, keyboard, two surfboards and his lacrosse sticks

6 housemates (one was away)

4 days

520 metres tin foil (26 x 20m)

580 plastic cups

62 litres of water

He even sent them a text later saying: 'Bad luck!'

But little did he know that they had secretly left his window ajar so they could climb in once he was gone.

Fellow business undergraduate, Sam Thomas, 20, said: 'It was great because we had access to his room all week.

'We had a house meeting and decided 
that we wanted to wrap everything in the room with something.

'We went 
for tin foil because it was easy to wrap and looks really impressive.

Game for a laugh: Jake took the joke in good humour. In fact, his housemates were miffed he wasn't more annoyed

Best of friends: Jake Walker (far right) with his fellow housemates (l-r) Dom Avis, Jon Hyland, Sholto Talbot (green stripey shirt), Josh White, Alex Lambert, Sam Thomas (black T-shirt) and James Beckett

'Some of us did the walls, while 
others did individual items like the fruit bowl. We even wrapped each of
his DVDs individually. It was a real team effort.'

Among the other items they wrapped were his computer monitor, keyboard, two surfboards and his lacrosse sticks.

Having finally completed it after four days, they hid to see Jake's reaction when he returned on Sunday, February 16.

Sam said: 'As soon as he opened the door, he saw the walls and said "oh my God!"

'We were a bit annoyed he wasn't more annoyed. He was actually very impressed.'
