The final moments before Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 took off from Amsterdam Schiphol Airport on Thursday were captured on video by a Malaysian passenger, it has been claimed.

Md Ali Md Salim, 30, reportedly posted footage of the plane's routine pre-departure process on Instagram on July 17 before the plane crashed near the Russian-Ukraine border.

Md Ali was reportedly studying at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, Amsterdam, for his doctorate of philosophy and he was travelling back to his home country of Malaysia to see his family for a holiday.

A video of passengers reportedly packing their belongings into the overhead compartments on flight MH17 has emerged on Instagram

Flight MH17 took off from Amsterdam at lunchtime and was flying at around 33,000ft on one of the main routes from Europe to Asia when it was struck by a missile.

Md Ali's Instagram page is private but it is believed the video - allegedly showing passengers before MH17 took off - was shared by a friend and it has now been widely shared on YouTube and Facebook.

'Bismillah... #hatiadasikitgentar (In the name of God... feeling a little bit nervous)', the caption reportedly said.

The Instagram profile says the user, @MASA1777, is a clinical psychologist.

In the video a male passenger, wearing a black t-shirt and beige pants, is seen lifting his blue and white backpack into the overhead compartment.

The backs of the plane's purple and teal seats can be seen, while a man in a salmon pink t-shirt sits to the right of the camera and a woman sits in front of him.

'We are in the final stages of our boarding and as we're loading please do ensure your phones are also off for the flight,' a member of the cabin crew can be heard saying.

Md Zaki Md Salim, MD Ali's older brother, told astroawani.com that his brother was one of the passengers on MH17.

'After receiving the news from my elder sister, I rushed to the airport here and MAS side confirmed my brother was one of the passengers of that flight,' he said at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport.

MailOnline has contacted Malaysia Airlines to confirm if the video was taken on board flight MH17 but they have not responded. It has so far been impossible to verify the footage.

The plane came down near a poultry farm in the village of Grabovo, an area controlled by pro-Russian rebels about 30 miles from the Ukraine-Russia border.

Witnesses claimed to have seen bodies falling out of the stricken plane over the village of Rassypnaya. Some residents feared they were being bombed.
