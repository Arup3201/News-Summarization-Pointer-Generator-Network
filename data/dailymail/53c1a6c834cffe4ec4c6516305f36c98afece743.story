Mohammed Abdi, who had a small part in Captain Phillips, has been jailed for the violent attacks

An actor who appeared alongside Tom Hanks as a Somali pirate in the blockbuster film Captain Phillips has been jailed for assaulting a man so badly he was left brain damaged. 

Mohammed Abdi, who had a minor role in the 2013 action film, fractured the man's cheekbone by kicking him in the head before bundling him into a car in Rusholme, Manchester, with two accomplices. 

The 27-year-old was jailed for two-and-a-half years for his 'deplorable' attacks by a judge who said he was a fan of the movie which was filmed in 2012. 

Manchester Crown Court heard how Abdi and two others attacked the man outside a fried chicken shop at 6am on March 2. 

Kicked unconscious, the victim, with whom Abdi had previously been involved in a fraud case, suffered a brain haemorrhage. 

In August the actor was involved in a separate attack in which he used bottle to slash a man's arm at a bakery in front of horrified staff and customers.

David Temkin, defending, said there was 'another side' to Abdi, who had the 'privileged experience' of nine weeks filming in Morocco after being cast in Captain Phillips. 

Sentencing the criminal to two-and-a-half years behind bars, Judge Martin Rudland said, referring to the film's final scenes: 'Was he in the capsule at the end when the Navy Seals were trying to get in? 

'When I watched this film I thought where have they got these fantastic Somali actors from? They are extremely convincing.'

The 27-year-old had a minor role in the film, starring (left to right) Barkhad Abdi, Tom Hanks and Faysal Ahmed, none of whom are implicated in the defendant's crimes

He added it was a 'great shame' to see the man facing jail. 

'It's a whisker between behaviour of this sort and death, but you were completely unmindful of that,' the judge said.

Mohammed Omar Ali, 33, and Hamid Hassan, 27, were jailed for two years after admitting GBH.

Abdi's accomplices in the second attack, Ismail Warsama, 30,  and Abdi Arteh, were given 12-month suspended sentences after admitting affray.
