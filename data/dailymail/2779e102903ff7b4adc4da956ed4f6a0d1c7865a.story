Stuart Lancaster hailed Friday night's victory over Wales as the most important result of his three-year tenure as England coach.

With a heavily depleted squad and huge psychological implications ahead of the World Cup, Lancaster described the 21-16 upset at the Millennium Stadium as the highest point since he took up his role in 2012.

Tries from Anthony Watson and Jonathan Joseph helped erase the haunting memories of two years ago, when England missed out on the Grand Slam, and turned the Red Rose side into overnight favourites to win the championship.

'I remember getting interviewed two years ago and it was probably the lowest point of my coaching career, without a doubt,' said Lancaster. 

'This win is definitely up there as the highest point because of all the pressure and emotion leading into it. We had a lot of challenges in getting new combinations together and I'm delighted to get the win. This cements our belief that we're going in the right direction.'

The match did not pass by without drama. Both sides were involved in a tunnel stand-off before kick-off, with England skipper Chris Robshaw refusing to lead out his side until England emerged from the dressing room.

'We wanted to make sure we went out at the right time and weren't stood our there waiting for three or four minutes,' said Lancaster. 'I thought our back-row was exceptional.

The atmosphere at the Millennium Stadium was electrifying both before and during the contest

Billy Vunipola, James Haskell and Chris Robshaw were excellent. For James Haskell, I think it was his best performance during my time as England coach and I think Billy Vunipola came of age.

England were written off ahead of the match, having arrived in Cardiff with a double figure injury list including Courtney Lawes and Manu Tuilagi. That forced Lancaster to dip into his reserves of fringe players, with Haskell and Jonathan Joseph among those making claims for a regular starting berth.

The result will cement England's belief for the rest of the tournament, while Wales are left in a dark place. Warren Gatland had a full strength squad at his disposal, yet his players choked under the expectation of a home victory.

'I don't look at it and say: 'are we concerned about England missing so many players?' said Gatland. 'It's top-level Test match rugby. They've got a number of injuries but they've got a huge amount of depth.'
