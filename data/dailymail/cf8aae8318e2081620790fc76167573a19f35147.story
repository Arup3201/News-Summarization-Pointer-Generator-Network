A Boston woman had her little toe bitten off in a fight at a raucous New Year's Eve party after she asked a female guest if she wanted to 'hook up.'

The unnamed victim was attending a friend's party in Dorchester when a fight broke out around 3 a.m., Boston police said.

According to officers, the altercation began when the woman approached another female party guest and propositioned her. However, the other
 woman's boyfriend overheard the 'hook up' suggestion and angrily 
grabbed the victim's neck and pulled her hair back, she told police.

Eventually, the man let her go after she begged repeatedly to be released, the Boston Globe reported.

Shaken, the victim said she rushed to tell the party host, a female friend of hers, what had happened but her friend didn't believe the story.

The host reportedly told her she'd ruined the party and another fight ensued. The victim told police her friend pounced on her, punching her until the pair were separated by other guests.

She said she then grabbed her belongings and fled the house but the host followed her outside and continued to beat on her.

During the tussle, the two women fell to the ground with the victim on top of her friend and they continued to fight until they were separated again.

That's when the host grabbed the victim's left foot and bit off her left little toe, the woman told officers.

Another friend of the victim drove her to Boston Medical Center where officers were called around 5 a.m. so the woman could report the assault and battery.

The officers reported seeing scratches on both of the victim's arms, her forehead, and over her neck and chest, as well as the missing toe.

Detectives are still investigating the incident, a police spokeswoman said.
