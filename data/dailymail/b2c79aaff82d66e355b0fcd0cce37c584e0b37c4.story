A bizarre 80-year-old ban on playing pinball machines in Oakland, California, has finally been lifted and a month-long tournament is being run to celebrate.

The game was outlawed across the U.S in the 1930s because it was considered gambling.

Officials argued that this classification was warranted as there was very little skill involved – that it was a game of chance.

They may have had a point as early machines didn't have flippers to control the ball. 

Lawmakers were also suspicions that the Mafia was controlling revenue from the machines and that they were distracting teenagers from more productive activities.

At first the law was strictly enforced with police in New York in the 1940s told that confiscating machines and arresting the owners was a top priority.

Competition: To celebrate the pinball ban being overturned RadioShack is running a tournament using an Iron Man machine

The tide was turned in the pro-pinball lobby's favour in 1976 when members of the amusement industry proved to the City Council that it was in fact a game of skill by getting a top player to demonstrate his expert touch. 

The council overturned the ban and other cities followed suit, but Oakland held fast, until last month.

To celebrate the momentous occasion pinball retailer RadioShack and maker Stern Pinball - the only manufacturer in the U.S - are running a month-long tournament.

Competitors are battling it out on an Iron Man Pro Vault Edition machine installed at RadioShack's Fruitvale Store in Oakland. Whoever notches up the highest score wins the machine.

Mike DeFazio, senior vice president of store concepts at RadioShack, said: 'Friends in the Maker community and other loyal customers inspired us to celebrate the return of pinball in Oakland. The pinball resurgence is a perfect combination of the best of retro and future technology.

'We thought this tournament would be a fun way to help celebrate our opening of 21 interactive remodel stores in the San Francisco and Oakland area. The game is legendary and has appeal for experts and novices alike.'

'Along with our friends at RadioShack, we're obviously psyched to see pinball prohibition end in Oakland,' said Gary Stern, CEO, Stern Pinball. 'Our company has origins in the pinball industry that date back to the ban's enactment itself. We're both honored and amazed to see brands like RadioShack embrace pinball, and help make it more accessible to a new generation of fans.'
