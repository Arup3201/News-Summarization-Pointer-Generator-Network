Officials are under fire for keeping details of an outbreak of the MRSA bug in Christmas turkeys secret from consumers (stock picture)

Officials are under fire for keeping details of an outbreak of the MRSA bug in Christmas turkeys secret from consumers.

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) and Defra, the food and farming ministry, have refused to identify the East Anglia farm involved.

They have also decided to allow the turkeys to be sold as normal.

Officials claim any risk to  consumers is ‘very low’.

But food industry experts have said it is vital consumers are given the full facts about safety issues.

Nick Martin, of Trace One, a technology company that works with supermarkets, said: ‘As the horsemeat crisis has shown, transparency is key when it comes to addressing consumer concerns over food products to avoid a public backlash.

‘Defra and the FSA have a duty to report the full details of the MRSA infection to consumers.’

The strain of MRSA was found on a small farm that sells thousands of turkeys to independent butchers and markets, rather than to a major supermarket.

The Government’s chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, said: ‘This MRSA is not a human sort and you can kill it by cooking the turkey well. This type of animal MRSA is rare in this country.

‘It’s killed by cooking and even if it isn’t, it’s low risk and not very frequent,’ she added.

While human superbug MRSA causes stomach upsets, anyone with this strain would develop a skin rash, similar to eczema.

The news came as a study by Mr Martin’s company, Trace One, claimed today that families are being kept in the dark over recalls of dangerous food products.

Food that is wrongly labelled or past its ‘use by’ date is being pulled from shelves by council officials.

Other products are withdrawn because of pest infestations or hygiene concerns.

A
 request under the Freedom of Information Act to the FSA and 35 of the 
biggest local authorities found records of 1,604 food recalls in 2012 – 
more than four a day.

Many were never reported to the FSA by local councils, and 40 per cent of councils did not keep records of incidents.

The
 firm said: ‘The full picture of potentially contaminated or otherwise 
unsafe products in the UK is far larger than consumers, retailers or 
manufacturers might expect.’

Mr
 Martin said many recalls ‘slip under the radar’. He said Caerphilly 
council, in Wales, ‘acted 63 times to remove unsafe products from sale’ –
 but did not have to report the incidents to the FSA.

He added: ‘Not having a standardised way to report, record and analyse food recalls and alerts  is unacceptable.’

Trace One makes software that helps retailers and producers work together on recalls.
