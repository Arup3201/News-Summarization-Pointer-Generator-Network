Manchester United target Thomas Vermaelen picked up a knee injury just 31 minutes into Belgium's 1-0 win over Russia.

The Arsenal defender, who has been heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford after the World Cup, played just over half an hour of Belgium's victory, before being replaced by Jan Vertonghen.

Vermaelen had taken Vertonghen's spot in the starting line-up for the clash with Fabio Capello's side, but after appearing to struggle with an injury in the warm-up failed to make it through the first half.

Future United boss Louis van Gaal hopes to sign the central-defender in a deal that could be worth in the region of Â£12million.

However - depending on the severity - his latest injury could put the move in jeopardy.

Another obstacle is Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger's unwillingness to let his skipper leave without having a replacement lined up.

Vermaelen has a year left on his current Arsenal contract, meaning he can leave the club for nothing next summer - a scenario the Gunners are keen to avoid.

The Belgian international is said to have grown frustrated in north London during recent months as he has been forced to play second fiddle to first-choice central defensive pairing Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny.
