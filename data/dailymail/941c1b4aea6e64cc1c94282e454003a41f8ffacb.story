Your smartphone and tablet may look clean, but recent research found thousands of germs living on touchscreens that are capable of spreading sickness bugs and diarrhoea.

To combat this filthy problem, Corning - the company behind the super-strong Gorilla Glass phone screens - has created an antibacterial display that kills bacteria on contact.

The display is fitted with antibacterial agent ionic silver and is the world’s first antimicrobial glass, capable of killing up to 99.9 per cent of germs.

Your smartphone and tablet may look clean, but thousands of germs can live on touchscreens, capable of spreading sickness and diarrhoea. To combat this filthy problem, Corning - the company behind the super-strong Gorilla Glass phone screens - has created an antibacterial display that kills bacteria on contact

Corning's new display is fitted with antibacterial agent ionic
 silver and is said to be the world’s first antimicrobial glass, capable of killing
 up to 99.9 per cent of germs.

Ionic silver is currently used in 
hospitals and has other medical uses.

For example, silver has been 
incorporated into creams, plasters and dressings and as an antibiotic 
coating on medical devices.

The silver ion is what’s called ‘bioactive’ and can kill bacteria on contact. It is safe for human use and has a low toxicity.

Plus, unlike current antibacterial sprays, the silver doesn’t fade and can’t be wiped off.

The glass is on display at the Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas and is currently being tested by various manufacturers.

It could one day be used on windows, workplace furniture, smartphone displays, tablets, calculators, and more.

‘Corning’s Antimicrobial Gorilla Glass inhibits the growth of algae, mould, mildew, fungi, and bacteria because of its built-in antimicrobial property, which is intrinsic to the glass and effective for the lifetime of a device,’ said James R. Steiner, senior vice president and general manager, Corning Specialty Materials.

Corning also claims it was able to added the antimicrobial feature without weakening the glass, and because the display is also scratch-resistant, microbes can't live in the cracks.

Gorilla Glass is currently used in Samsung Galaxy handsets, as well as Google's Nexus 7 and 10 tablets and the Sony Bravia NX and HX series of televisions.
