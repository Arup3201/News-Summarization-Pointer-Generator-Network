Arsenal are considering a fresh move for Aston Villa defender Ron Vlaar as they seek a solution to their defensive woes.

The Gunners were interested in the Dutchman during the closing days of the summer transfer window following the departure of Thomas Vermaelen to Barcelona.

And Arsene Wenger is contemplating another move for the 29-year-old central defender in the January transfer window.

Manchester United are also interested in Vlaar as Louis van Gaal looks to resolve his side's own defensive deficiencies.

Vlaar, who is out of contract at the end of the season, has played under Van Gaal for Holland and his relationship with the manager could prove vital as United and Arsenal go head-to-head.

Aston Villa want to keep Vlaar, but know they face losing him for nothing next summer and could look to cash in on him in January.

Laurent Koscielny will be out of the game against Hull this weekend with an achilles problem

Arsenal are committed to signing a new central defender at the turn of the year after it became abundantly clear they are short of options in the position.

Laurent Koscielny's achilles injury has seen left-back Nacho Monreal play as a makeshift central defender in recent weeks.

Tuesday's capitulation against Anderlecht underlined the club's need to reinforce their defence in January.

Celtic centre-half Virgil van Dijk is another option for the Gunners.
