A two-year-old boy was rescued by firefighters after he became stuck in a drain in his back yard in Melbourne on Saturday evening. 

Rescuers rushed to the scene in the Victorian suburb of Blackburn about 6pm.

The firefighters used jackhammers and hydraulic equipment to free the boy when one of his legs became lodged in the small concrete drain, restricting him up to his hip.

A Metropolitan Fire Brigade spokeswoman said rescue operators spent an hour chipping away at the drain with specialist equipment before the boy's leg was freed.

Ambulance officers sedated the toddler during the incident and he was taken to hospital for observation.
