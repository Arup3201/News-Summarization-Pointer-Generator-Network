A young mother shed 4st 7lb after her partner told her she had become 'too fat to find attractive'.

Stacey Hammond-Moore, 25, of Walsall, was left fearing for the future of her relationship when her boyfriend told her he was no longer physically attracted to her because of her weight. Today the pair are happily married.

The trainee teaching assistant said: 'He told me outright that he wasn’t attracted to me anymore.

Stacey, who was a size 10 when the couple first met, found her weight crept up to 15st following the birth of her son Alistair (pictured) in 2009

'I felt upset because I didn’t want to lose him. I was worried that he was going to start looking elsewhere.

'I was not happy at the time but now I look back and know it was a case of being cruel to be kind.'

Mrs Hammond-Moore and her husband Jonathan Moore, 31, a manager of a scrap company, have been a couple for 10 years and wed in 2011. Together they have two children, daughter Ruby,  eight, and son Alistair, five.

Mr Moore said: 'I do a lot of fitness. I go to the gym and play football, so that affected my view of things.'

Mrs Hammond-Moore’s weight crept up to 15st following the birth of her son in 2009. At her heaviest weight she was wearing size 20 clothes.

Mr Moore said: 'When I first met Stacey ten years ago she was just over 10st. She was slim, and very active.

'When she was larger she seemed so depressed every day. I could tell how uncomfortable she was by it all.'

As her weight piled on, Mrs Hammond-Moore began experiencing breathlessness and lost confidence in her body image.

She
 said: 'I was too ashamed to take my children swimming because I was 
worried about what I would look like in a bathing suit. I was concerned 
that if I took the kids to a theme park, I would get stuck on the 
rides.'

After
 her husband’s comments, which he made in 2008, she began thinking about
 how her weight was affecting her and went about changing her lifestyle.

She said: 
'I didn’t want to be the fattest mum in the playground or be a reason 
for them to be picked on by their classmates. Most of all, I wanted to 
have more energy to be able to keep up with them.”

She
 joined an NHS weight management programme in 2010 and lost three and a 
half stone. Her weight fluctuated for a short period, but in June 2012 
she joined Slimming World, losing a further two and half stone in a 
year.

Her
 hard work meant she met her target weight before her summer holidays in
 2013, allowing her to feel comfortable showing off her body in a 
bikini.

Before
 her diet she would not stick to regular meals, preferring takeaways and
 McDonalds food when she became hungry. There was no fruit or vegetables
 in her meals and she would snack on crisps and chocolate to satisfy 
cravings.

In March 2014 her husband treated her to a boudoir photoshoot to allow her to show off her new body.

Mr Moore says he is very proud of Stacey's weight loss  (right with her Slimming World award)

Now she is following the Slimming World diet and on a normal day, will eat lean bacon on wholemeal bread, salads and low fat bolognaises and curries.

She has also ditched the multipack crisps and eats fruits and yoghurts instead.

Mrs Hammond-Moore is now 10st 7lb and feels much more confident in her size 10 clothes.

She said: 'I love my new figure. I’ve transformed myself to the point where people don’t recognise me.'

'By changing my diet to healthier options it’s better for the kids, as they share the food too.'

In March 2014 her husband treated her to a boudoir photoshoot to allow her to show off her new body.

She said: 'The photos have given me much more confidence. The compliments I’ve had from people have been out of this world.”

Mr Moore said: 'She has done extremely well. She is nearly back to the size she was when I met her. I’m extremely proud, to lose 4st overall is very impressive. I can’t fault her at all now, she looks absolutely beautiful.'

Mrs Hammond-Moore added: 'Jonathan wouldn’t dream of telling me I’m too fat now. In fact, he loves to show me off.

'It was hurtful at the time, but now I know how much better my life is. I’m glad he gave me the kick I needed to turn my life around.

'It’s given me the confidence to be a stronger woman and and I’m so much happier now.'
