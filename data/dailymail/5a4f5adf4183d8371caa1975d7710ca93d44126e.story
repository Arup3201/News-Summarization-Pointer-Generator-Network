Proposals: New parents would get up to 15 months leave between them and be able to switch time off with little notice under Lib Dem plans (library image)

Plans to allow new parents to ‘chop and change’ time off work in the first year of their child’s life are in turmoil after a bitter coalition row.

To the anger of senior Conservatives, who argue businesses cannot be expected to cope with more rights for employees as the economy comes out of recession, their Liberal Democrat partners have proposed a dramatic extension of Government plans for shared parental leave.

According to one senior Tory source, Lib Dems want to extend the maximum time off after the birth of a baby to 15 months and allow parents to repeatedly switch periods of leave between them.

Business Secretary Vince Cable and equalities minister Jo Swinson are at odds with Tory colleagues over plans that couples must be allowed to switch leave up to at least half a dozen times, so that one has a spell at home, the other at work, before swapping over time and again.

They also suggest that new parents should be guaranteed a return to the same job however long their period of leave. Currently, employers can offer an equivalent post after six months.

The proposals are understood to have prompted a major row inside the coalition, with Conservative ministers, including Chris Grayling, Grant Shapps, Philip Hammond and Eric Pickles objecting so strongly that they have now been shelved.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who has condemned existing rules meaning new fathers only get two weeks off work as ‘Edwardian’, was on the point of announcing the extended parental leave package, drawn up by Miss Swinson.

The coalition has agreed that new fathers should be able to take up to six months of paid leave from work.

The Children and Families Bill will give them the right to ‘mix and match’ childcare arrangements in the first year of their baby’s life from April 2015. Employed mothers will still be entitled to 52 weeks of maternity leave.

However, working parents will have much greater flexibility about how they ‘mix and match’ their leave. They may take it in turns or take it together, providing it is not more than 52 weeks in total.

Mothers will have to take at least the initial two weeks of leave after birth as a recovery period, but can then choose to end the maternity leave and parents can opt to share the remaining leave.

Legislation to revolutionise the workplace by introducing flexible parental leave prompted dismay from some business leaders, who have said it will be a ‘nightmare’ to administer.

The Government insists employees will have to give employers proper notice of their intention to take leave, to allow businesses to plan for absences. Employees must tell employers at least 15 weeks before the week a baby is expected when they want their leave to start, though they can change this with 28 days’ notice.

However, according to one well-placed 
source, Lib Dem ministers attempted to change the agreed package of 
reforms so that couples could ‘chop and change’ shared parental leave 
with less notice.

The Lib Dems say firms only need eight weeks’ notice 
of an employee’s intention to return, while the Tories say it should be 
at least 12 weeks.

The Lib Dems also are said to have suggested that the total leave period should be increased to 65 weeks and that employers lose the right to offer employees who return after more than six months an equivalent post, not necessarily the same one.

‘The Government has agreed a package of reforms with business and then all this extra stuff was all slipped in by the Lib Dems, even though a lot of it hadn’t even been consulted on,’ said the source.

‘It was actually about to be announced by Nick Clegg. How on earth would the typical small business with three or four employees contend with staff mixing and matching time off with a week’s notice?’

Shared parental leave is designed to smash the traditional assumption that it is the mother who should take time off work to care for a new child.

Ministers say the measures will offer more flexibility to modern families where women are as likely as men to be the main breadwinner and allow fathers to spend more time with their children.

The issue caused a Cabinet rift with some ministers having argued that pledges to extend parental leave and flexible working rights at a time of economic difficulty.

Under existing rules, mothers are entitled to take 12 months maternity leave, of which nine months are paid. Fathers can take two weeks paid paternity leave.

The Deputy Prime Minister said recently fathers should be able to do more of the ‘heavy lifting’ if mothers want to return to work after having a child.

‘We are revolutionising parental leave so it is not paternity leave anymore, it becomes parental leave,’ Mr Clegg said.

‘You and your wife or partner will be able to chop and change, and exchange the block of leave that presently is afforded to the mother through maternity leave, as you wish.

‘I know plenty of women who feel that they want to go back to work earlier than their partners or their husbands do, that’s just the way families are, obviously that’s great.

‘But we’ve got these Edwardian rules - I’ve experienced it myself three times. It’s crazy that when your child is born you’ve got just a couple of weeks, when in a sense you’re least relevant to the child, because they’re barely aware that you’re there.’

Miss Swinson wrote on Twitter that shared parental leave is ‘a fantastic, much-needed policy’. She insisted that Tory claims the Lib Dems had proposed a leave period as long as 65 weeks were ‘just wrong’.
