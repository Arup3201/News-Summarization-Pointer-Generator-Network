As any marketing fatcat knows ... when you've run out of ideas to promote a new product, just hire a group of attractive models to strip off while you film it with a soft focus in black and white.

And if you can persuade a group of complete strangers to take off each other's clothes instead of their own, then all the better.

That's what advertising executives at U.S. cable channel Showtime did with their new video to promote hit show Masters of Sex.

And while the result may be painfully cringe-inducing at first, it ultimately proves rather sweet as they fumble with zips and buttons, tear trousers and giggle awkwardly as they disrobe.

The video, called Undress Me, shows ten couples each shaking hands for the first time before proceeding to remove each other's clothes next to a single bed.

Some of them struggle while others shed blouses or jeans with ease.

But as the undressing goes on, embarrassment soon ebbs away and, by the end, they are all under the sheets having a kiss and a cuddle.

The ad, by filmmaker Tatia PIlieva, is a sequel to First Kiss which went viral on the internet when it was released in March.

First Kiss followed the same theme as Undress Me but saw couples simply kiss instead of strip off.

Posting Undress Me on her YouTube channel, Ms PIlieva, originally from the Republic of Georgia, wrote: 'I asked strangers to undress each other and get in bed.  Nothing else.  No rules.'
