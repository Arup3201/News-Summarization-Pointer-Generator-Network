A suspected stowaway has been killed after the coach he had clung to for almost 200 miles hit him as he emerged from underneath it.

The man, who is believed to be in his 20s or 30s and of African or Arabic origin, is thought to have climbed beneath the coach as it left Calais in an attempt to smuggle himself into the UK.

He remained there unknown to the driver as the coach travelled to Bexwell, near Downham Market in Norfolk.

The coach driver from the company was unaware the man had clung to the bottom of the bus after trip

It was as the coach reversed into its home depot at D&H Harrods Coaches at about 1.20am yesterday that he was hit.

Norfolk Police said that the man, who has not been named, died at the scene after suffering multiple injuries.

Paul Harrod, who helps to run D&H Coaches with his brother Mark and parents Anne and Derek, said the fatal drama happened after the bus returned from a three-day trip to France.

He said: ‘The driver and border control carried out all the appropriate checks at Calais and the appropriate authorities were called here.

‘We are working with the police to help them with their investigations.’

Norfolk Police said they had launched an investigation into the tragedy.

A force spokesman said: ‘An inspector from the Health and Safety Executive, crime scene investigators and collision investigators remain at the scene conducting further inquiries.

‘A Home Office post-mortem is due to take place to determine the cause of death.’

A Health and Safety Executive spokesman said: ‘The HSE is aware of the incident and are working jointly with Norfolk Police with the police taking the lead.’

Family-run D&H Harrolds is one of the longest-established coach companies in East Anglia after being set up in 1927 by Herman Harrod.
