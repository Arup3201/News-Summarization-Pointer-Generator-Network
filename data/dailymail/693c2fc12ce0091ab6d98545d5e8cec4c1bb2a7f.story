A man who was trapped in his car for nine hours after a crash has miraculously survived without a scratch.

Adam Davidson, 36, blacked out after his car flipped over a hedge in Hereford on Friday and was left trapped overnight, dangling precariously over a stream.

When he came round the following morning and was able to call for help, emergency services faced a race against time to find him before he lost consciousness again.

Mr Davidson, a diabetic, had no idea where he was, so operators were forced to launch a massive search operation across the county in a bid to locate him. 

A huge rescue team was sent to track Mr Davidson's location after the crash in Hereford, which left the driver unconscious and trapped in his car overnight, dangling precariously over a stream

Four fire engines were sent across north Herefordshire with their sirens blaring - and after an hour of Mr Davidson indicating whether the sirens were getting closer or not, he was finally located. 

And when he was finally freed, Mr Davidson had no serious injuries and was allowed home after a quick visit to the hospital.

Mr Davidson, a chef, was driving home from work at the Tram Inn in Eardisley when he was almost crushed in the accident.

He remained out cold overnight as his car hung over the water and his body temperature dropped dangerously low.

Hereford Fire and Rescue received his call at 7.30am on Saturday and mounted an urgent attempt to locate him.

As the fire engines drove around, the operator used his indicators of whether the sirens were getting closer or further away to trace him.

After 40 minutes, the rescue team had narrowed his location down to within a few miles - but it took another 20 minutes before he was found and could be treated by paramedics at the scene.

Mr Davidson suffered no serious injuries and was readmitted to Hereford County Hospital for further checks a day later.

Hereford station commander Phil Major, who led the team that eventually rescued the driver, called him 'one of the luckiest people I have ever seen'.

He said: 'The car had somehow cleared the hedge, leaving no sign of the accident on the road.

'When we arrived, the car was unstable and hanging over a stream on its side.

'He was one of the luckiest people I have ever seen - having fallen unconscious, had the car slipped, he could have drowned in just a few inches of water.

'I have never been part of a search mission like it.

'Ordinarily there is some mark on the road or we can use thermal imaging cameras, but at that point the engine would have cooled down and his body temperature would have dropped.

'We knew he lived in Hereford and had been travelling home from work so we got together a worked out a way to use the sirens to locate him.

'We couldn't have done it without great work from all three emergency services.'
