Once derided by environmental groups as the ultimate  gas-guzzling ‘Chelsea tractor’ Range Rover has cleaned up its act with its first ever super-green diesel-electric hybrid.It aims to make the upmarket off-roader one of the cleanest and most fuel-efficient 4x4s  on the road and is part of a major new £370million investment announced by Jaguar Land Rover, and marked with a star-studded gala tonight attended by Olympic gold medalists Victoria Pendleton and Greg Rutherford, Zara Philips, comedian Jimmy Carr and more.The car-maker says it is the first time such technology has been used on a ‘true’ all-terrain off-roader.

And bosses say it will offer drivers ‘a better Business Class experience than British Airways.’

Thanks to an  integral electric motor which boosts an already frugal new
3.0 litre  V6 turbo-charged diesel engine, the  luxury  4X4  will do  
45 miles to the gallon and give out CO2 emissions as low as a family 
saloon. But it will still sprint rapidly from rest to 60mph in under 
seven seconds.

A serious weight-loss diet helped by an all-aluminium body and chassis 
has enabled it to shed 420kg -  the equivalent of five adult occupants –
boosting fuel economy and reducing pollution levels.

But its ‘green’ credentials don’t stop there. Half the lightweight but 
super-strong aluminium used in the car is recycled from nearly 29,000 
drinks cans. And materials from 6,500 recycled plastic bottles are used 
in every vehicle to create components. It also has the latest 
‘stop-start’ technology which cuts out the engine when it is idling to 
reduce fuel consumption and pollution.

And when it reaches the end of its life, some 85 per cent of the new Range Rover’s parts can be recycled.

Land Rover’s first ever ‘hybrid’ is part of the new fourth generation 
Range Rover line-up which  was given a celebrity rock-star reception 
tonight at a special gala launch in London’s Richmond
Park on a day which saw  Jaguar Land Rover and Honda announce new 
investments totalling nearly £700million  in their British factories.

Dire Straits pop musician and Range Rover owner  Mark Knopfler was 
leading the celebrations with  a concert to  500 guests including model Jodie Kidd and TV presenter Ferne Cotton.

The launch  also coincided with a slight rise in UK car sales during 
August as the export-led motor industry again bucked the dismal economic
trend.

The Range Rover hybrid features  a new 3.0litre  V6 turbo-charged diesel
engine  linked to an electric motor and battery. The system  captures 
motion energy generated when the car brakes and decelerates, stores it I
the battery, and the release it to power the electric motor. This will 
either boost the diesel engine, or allow the car to travel under 
electric power only, to reduce fuel consumption and pollution.

Land Rover design director Gerry McGovern  said the luxurious interior 
would offer an executive ‘business class’ experience: ‘When you think of
Business Class you tend to think of British Airways. This is better 
than BA’

Conventional engines will also be offered on the range: the new and 
frugal  3.0 litre V6 diesel engine that will still manage 37 mpg on its 
own without the electric motor support;  a 4.4 litre V8 diesel, and a 
powerful 5.0 litre supercharged V8  petrol  engine  that will propel it 
from rest to 60mph  in just 5.4 seconds.

Jaguar land Rover  bosses  said the firm was ‘firing on all cylinders’ 
and pledged a big expansion of Land Rover models and sales as it  
embarks on ‘ambitious plans’ to ‘broaden’ its 4X4 footprint around the 
world.

The cash injection is to upgrade Land Rover’s factory at Solihull in the West Midlands.

Order books for the fourth-generation Range Rover begin this month for 
deliveries in January of the up-market off-roader whose prices will 
start from £71,295 rising to around £100,000.
