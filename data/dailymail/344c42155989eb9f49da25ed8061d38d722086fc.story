A teenager whose passport has been cancelled on security grounds turned up to a TV discussion about Australians fighting in Syria wearing an Islamic State flag symbol and then dramatically stormed out.

Abu Bakr, 19, who is on the radar of security services, walked off set during an SBS Insight episode due to be shown on Tuesday night.

The teenager, who was born in Australia but has an Italian and Iraqi background, turned up to the discussion wearing an Islamic State flag logo on his black jacket.

Bakr thinks Muslims are obligated help fellow Muslims overseas and reportedly does not feel connected with his home country of Australia.

He said 'in order for me to be connected to the values here of Australia, the Australian government needs to stop picking on the Muslims here.'

As the TV discussion, fronted by journalist Jenny Brockie, turned to the issue of passports being cancelled his lawyer Zali Burrows and the show's producer began to knock heads.

Burrows told Daily Mail Australia her client left because 'the whole set up was a farce and they duped guests as to the theme'.

'Then again perhaps we should not be worried as nobody watches SBS unless they are looking for soft porn on a Friday night.' she added.

Burrows said she and Bakr were told the discussion would be about the new anti-terror laws announced by Prime Minister Tony Abbott last week.

Instead she said they spent two 'boring' hours talking about fighting in Syria and the Islamic State organisation.

'He was like a lamb brought to slaughter... he's a young kid who's passionate about injustice,' Burrows said of her client.

She did not comment when asked why Bakr's passport was revoked.

The SBS show on Tuesday night also includes appearances from other staunch supporters of the Islamic State, formerly known as ISIS, as well as worried family members.

Australian Mohamed Zuhbi appeared on the show from Turkey, via Skype, and claimed he is doing humanitarian work in Syria but has not been part of the fighting.

The man, who was born in Syria but grew up in Australia from the age of one, said: 'I believe that [Islamic State] are the future of Syria and I believe that they're the future of the Islamic empire to come.'

Abdul Salam Mahmoud, an Australian citizen who is currently in Latakia in Syria, also said he's there doing humanitarian work.

'We give monthly payments to families who have orphans and widows and we give them food packages,' he said.

'In Islam we're obligated. Wherever our people are being harmed or being oppressed it's an obligation for us to go and help them to fight tyranny and to fight oppression.'

A Melbourne father, who does not wish to be identified, told how his 17-year-old son had become radicalised, grown a long beard and constantly talks about the war between Islamic denominations the Shias and Sunnis.

'I'm worried... he wants to go to Syria and join those groups and he kill some innocent peopleand he (might) die himself,' Abdullah told Insight.

'He's quiet and depressed.'

The show was filmed after it emerged there are around 60 Australians fighting in Syria at the moment

Abdullah, who migrated to Australia from Afghanistan, explained: 'I don't know where he get brainwashed, where he's been taught like this to do these things.'

The show was filmed after it emerged there are around 60 Australians fighting in Syria at the moment.

Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said the Federal Government is 'deeply concerned' about what will happen when they Australians return home.

'We are deeply concerned that this domestic security challenge will mean that Australiancitizens fighting in these conflicts overseas will return to this country as hardened home-grown terrorists who may use their experience, the skills that they've gained, to carry out an attack in this country,' she said.

Sheikh Mohamadu Saleem (left), the spokesperson of the Australian National Imams Council, said imams are trying to engage with young men to give religious advice and explain that it is not the duty of Australian Muslims to fight overseas.

This is has led to new counter terrorism laws and a $630 million boost to spy and counter-terror agencies being pledged by Prime Minister Tony Abbott last week.

The anti-terror measures include stronger powers for authorities to detain and question jihadists who have fought alongside terrorists overseas in countries like Syria and Iraq.

Dozens of Australians' passports have also now been cancelled and arrest warrants have been issued for Sydney-born jihadists Mohamed Elomar and Khaled Sharrouf who are currently fighting in Syria.

Khaled Sharrouf, a former Sydney resident, is thought to be fighting with al-Qaeda off-shoot Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Security agencies believe he left Australia using his brother's passport in December, and he will be arrested on terrorism-related charges if he ever returns to Australia.

Former Sydney boxer Mohamed Elomar has also fled to Syria where he was recently pictured holding up two decapitated heads in an image posted on Twitter by Sharrouf

Sheikh Mohamadu Saleem, the spokesperson of the Australian National Imams Council, appeared on the Insight show and said imams are trying to engage with young men to give religious advice and explain that it is not the duty of Australian Muslims to fight overseas.

'There is a very small number of people... who are not listening,' he admitted.

'But the large number of people who are in schools, in the universities, doing the right thing, they are listening.'

Meanwhile, Rodger Shanahan, who has served with the United Nations in South Lebanon and Syria and is now affiliated with the Lowy Institute, said we need to get to the bottom of why people are going to Syria.

He claimed those who Australians who have been killed in the conflict were not particularly well educated.

Insight: Joining the Fight is on Tuesday 12 August, 8.30pm on SBS ONE.
