It's a stunt that would terrify most men - having a live snake in their trousers.

But this man did it just to get a few laughs from his fellow participants on a jungle survival skills expedition in Bolivia.

Video of the stunt shows the man casually walking away from the camera and unzipping his trousers as he prepares to relieve himself.

He then finishes with a bit of a shake, before turning around to face the camera.

As he does so a boa constrictor can be seen poking out of the front of his zipper. The snake then proceeds to slither out.

According to the camera man, the stuntman had several years experience handling dangerous and poisonous animals in the region, and performed the trick simply to lighten the mood. 

According to the Mirror he said: 'The presence of a boa constrictor at your side will help you urinate better and will also prevent small rodents from entering your clothing.'

Escape route: The boa constrictor then slithered right out of the man's pants and on to the ground below

That's a wrap: The snake then slithered away as the man casually stood there like nothing had happened
