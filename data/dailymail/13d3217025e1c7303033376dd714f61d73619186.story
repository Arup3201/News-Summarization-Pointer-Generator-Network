 

An FBI agent testified Thursday that former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, spent many nights together in the governor's mansion - even though their lawyers claimed the couple were barely speaking to one another.  

The revelation about the McDonnells' cohabitation calls into question the defense team's central argument that the couple's failing marriage made a conspiracy between them implausible.

The agent was the final witness jurors heard from in the McDonnells' public corruption trial. They will return Friday morning for closing arguments before beginning deliberations on 14 charges punishable by up to decades in prison and millions of dollars in fines.

Bob McDonnell spent more than four days on the witness stand proclaiming his innocence and describing how his marriage deteriorated as he climbed the political ladder, ultimately reaching the office once held by Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry. 

The defense claims the marriage was so strained that the McDonnells could not have pulled off a criminal conspiracy.

They are charged with accepting more than $165,000 in gifts, free vacations and loans from former Star Scientific Inc. CEO Jonnie Williams in exchange for promoting his company's supposed panacea, the tobacco-derived anti-inflammatory Anatabloc.

Outside the courthouse in Richmond Thursday, Bob McDonnell told WVEC that he forgives Jonnie Williams.

The former governor also said he is not concerned about the outcome of the trial.

'I’m 60-year-old, I’ve done a lot of living,' McDonnell said. 'I’ve got amazing faith in God and my family and the ability of the jury to find the truth.' 

Williams testified under immunity that he spent lavishly on the McDonnells only to get their help as he sought credibility for the product and state-backed research on its effectiveness. 

Maureen McDonnell's attorney said the first lady developed a 'crush' on Williams, but he testified they weren't even friends — that the relationship was strictly professional.

The last witness was FBI agent Kathryn Weber, who analyzed the McDonnells' cellphone records and calendars and concluded that they spent 90 per cent of their nights together during the 22 months that were the focus of the investigation.

The testimony was intended to undercut the marital discord theory promoted by the defense.

Growing apart: Bob McDonnell (center) testified that he got into the habit of working late to avoid going home and dealing with his Maureen's anger

Most of the nights together were in the governor's mansion, Weber testified, but some were on trips.

Bob McDonnell's attorney, John Brownlee, challenged Weber's methodology and conclusions. He rattled off 20 occasions when McDonnell did not arrive at the governor's mansion until 11pm or later, implying that the couple couldn't have had much time together on those nights.

Brownlee also pointed to several blank daily calendars for Maureen McDonnell, which the FBI agent counted as nights at the mansion. 

In response to the attorney's question, Weber said she was not aware that Maureen McDonnell sometimes spent the night at the couple's private home in suburban Richmond.

Daughter speaks: The McDonnells' eldest daughter, Jeanine (right) testified that her parents’ marriage had been troubled for 20 years and her mother (left) developed 'a mild obsession' with businessman Jonnie Williams

Prosecutor Jessica Aber suggested that the few instances raised by Brownlee did not substantially alter the overall picture of how often the McDonnells were together.

McDonnell had testified that he got into the habit of working late to avoid going home and dealing with his wife's anger, and that he and his wife are living apart during the trial.

On Wednesday, the jury heard from the McDonnells' eldest daughter, Jeanine, who also testified that her parents’ marriage had been troubled for many years and her mom developed 'a mild obsession' with Jonnie Williams.

Jeanine McDonnell said her parents rarely spoke to each other in private, going back decades.

She said as far back as 20 years ago, her father was rarely home and her mother was left largely alone to raise the couple’s five kids. Jeanine McDonnell said she believed, even as a child, that her mother was depressed and that she took long baths and threw herself into soap operas to counter her loneliness.

When the McDonnells were able to create family time, she said, Bob McDonnell devoted himself to his children, and his wife received lowest priority.

It got worse as McDonnell’s career advanced from state delegate, to attorney general, to governor, and then in 2012 when he became a chief surrogate for GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney. Still, Jeanine McDonnell said, her parents were adept at putting up a good front in public.

'Any time they went in a public setting, it was like a switch flipped and they turned it on,' she said.
