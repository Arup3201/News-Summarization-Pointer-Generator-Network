Police have arrested or indicted ten suspected members of an international ring of cyber thieves who allegedly hijacked more than 1,000 StubHub users' accounts as part of a $1.6million fraud.

Prosecutors have said more than 3,500 tickets were fraudulently bought by the thieves in a bid to make money by reselling them.

Some of the tickets were for gigs by Elton John, Justin Timberlake and Jay-Z, sports events including New York Yankees baseball games and the US Open, and Broadway shows such as The Book of Mormon.

The scheme spooled from Russia to London to Toronto to the New York area and to Barcelona, in Spain, where accused Russian ringleader Vadim Polyakov was arrested while on holiday earlier this month.

Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr announced the arrests on Wednesday following an operation which also involved the City of London Police and Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

Polyakov, 30, was awaiting extradition, and it wasn't immediately clear whether he had a lawyer. Three other men indicted in the case hadn't yet been arrested; two are in Russia. 

Three suspected money-launderers were arrested in London while another was arrested in Toronto on local charges there.  

The case comes amid growing concern about data thieves targeting consumer giants. 

StubHub has said it was alerted to 'a small number of accounts that had been illegally taken over by fraudsters' last year.

While prosecutors said they were not certain how the alleged thieves got access, San Francisco-based StubHub said they got account holders' login and password information from key-loggers or other malware on the customers' computers or from data breaches at other businesses. 

StubHub, which is owned by eBay, said there had been 'no intrusions into StubHub technical or financial systems.'

In the last few years, such major companies as Target, LinkedIn, eBay and Neiman Marcus have been hacked. 

Since many customers use the same email and password on multiple websites, thieves can use a combination from one site that works in many others, data security experts say.

Joe Siegrist, the CEO of LastPass, which makes password-management software, warned it was like re-using 'the same key for every lock in your life - especially if you're giving that key out to everyone you meet.'

In the StubHub case, members of the ring allegedly re-sold the tickets and routed the money to others who laundered it, and the group split the profits, Vance said.

Daniel Petryszyn, 28, and Bryan Caputo, 29, pleaded not guilty yesterday to money laundering and stolen property possession charges.

Petryszyn 'has every intention of challenging these charges,' said his lawyer, Liam Malanaphy.

Caputo simply re-sold some tickets, said his lawyer, Reginald Sharpe. 'If they were stolen, he didn't know that they were,' Sharpe said.
