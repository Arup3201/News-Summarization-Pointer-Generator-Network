A grieving mother in Ohio is disgusted after she found her son's cremated remains wrapped in a Walmart bag.

Nancy Bronner of Amelia, Ohio lost her 17-year-old son T.J. Mitchell last September due to a heart condition.

Ever since he was 15, her son knew he wanted to be cremated when he died. So when he passed away, his remains were cremated and his ashes split among family members into four urns.

What she found: Nancy Bronner says she wanted to hold her son one last time when she opened his urn and found his ashes wrapped in a Walmart bag

Disrespectful: Ms Bronner, left, has called the act a desecration of her son, right, T.J. Mitchell's remains

Upset: Ms Bronner took pictures of the desecration and then transferred the ashes out of the grocery bag

But Ms Bronner was surprised when she opened her urn.

'I just wanted to hold my baby one last time,' she told WCPO. 'So I opened the urn, and found  Walmart bag in the urn. The funeral home had put my son's ashes in a Walmart bag.'

She calls the act disrespectful, unprofessional and a desecration of her son's remains. 

Explanation: The cremation was performed at McDaniel Funeral Home. Coroner Bob McDaniel says he put the ashes in the bag since the family didn't provide any and the urns didn't seal

T.J. was cremated at McDaniel Funeral Home in Dry Ridge, Kentucky by Bob McDaniel, who is also the Grant County coroner.

The teens remains were being split between four urns - something the funeral home doesn't usually do - and no one in the family supplied bags for the urns which do not seal.

In an attempt to make sure no ashes spilled out, Mr McDaniel used bags that he had on hand to wrap the ashed in the urns.

He says he took scissors to the shopping bags to remove any store logos before wrapping the ashes.

T.J.'s father Thomas Mitchell, and Nancy Bronner's ex-husband, says using the Walmart bags could be in bad judgement but doesn't believe the coroner acted maliciously.

Mr Mitchell still keeps his sons remains wrapped in the grocery bag the funeral home provided.

Understanding: T.J.'s father still keeps his son's ashes in the grocery bag provided

Ms Bronner has since taken her son's ashes to another funeral home to be placed in a clear plastic bag.

Ms Bronner, who says she is in therapy over her son's death, has contacted the Kentucky Attorney General's Office and the Board of Embalmers and Funeral Directors to complain about the funeral home.

'I don't care who you are, it's not right to put a human person's ashes in a Walmart bag,' she said. 'It is disrespectful. You don't do that to a parent who has lost their child. You don't do that to anyone. I just want to make sure that this never happens again to another person,' she said.
