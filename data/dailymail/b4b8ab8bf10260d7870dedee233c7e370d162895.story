At the age of 15, most girls are just learning about fashion. But Madison Robinson is already on track to becoming a millionaire thanks to an ingenious design for light-up flip-flops for kids.

The teenager, from Galveston Island, Texas, came up with the idea for Fish Flops at the age of just eight.

With the help of her father, Dan, and some 'friends and family financing' she was able to turn her drawings into product samples and sell the idea to retailers at trade fairs.

And it seems retailers themselves can't get enough of the brightly-colored footwear. Already more than 30 stores have placed 
orders including national powerhouses Nordstrom and Macy's.

She told My Fox Houston: 'It's exciting. I didn't think [Fish Flops] would come all the way this far. I thought they would just
 stay in boutiques, but now they're in Nordstrom.'

She reveals that she made the initial approach to the retailer herself by letter, and created a series of custom designs that could be sold in stores across the U.S.

Now she is doing the same for Macy's, after buyers asked her to make a line for adult women.

The shoes sell for around $25 a pair,
 and, just two years since the company's official launch, over 60,000 pairs have sold, making for retail sales of 
at least $1.2 million.

Each pair comes with a tag bearing Madison's photo and a message explaining how her idea was born.

 stay in boutiques, but now they're in Nordstrom'

'In 2006, I had an idea to make flip 
flops that showed my love for swimming, fishing and drawing,' it reads. ' I hope you
 wear them, love them and share them with your friends and I hope they 
make you smile.'

Madison, who will start 10th grade next fall, is involved in every step of the Fish Flops business.

She draws all of her own designs and chooses color combinations
 digitally, but has also learned how to pack shipments, stock the 
warehouse, explain her pricing, host a trade show booth, and make a sales
 pitch.

But it seems she has a particular aptitude for marketing through social media.

Thanks to her Twitter account, she captured the interest of the daughter of Entertainment Tonight host Nancy O'Dell, as well as HSN fitness personality 
Tony Little.

She admits that her 
business has helped hone several life skills, such as public speaking, thanks to the experience of explaining her product at industry expos and making presentations to 
stone-faced department store buyers.

She has
 also learned patience. The worst part of business, Madison says, is 
'waiting for stores to decide' if they want her goods on their shelves.

And Fish Flops has also made her a discerning consumer.

'When I go shoe shopping now, I look carefully at the quality of the 
materials,' she says. Fish Flops, she explains, are sturdy and made without punch-out 
holes in the soles so the straps don't pop out the way they do in 
generic flip-flops.

Madison has already put away enough profits to cover her 
college tuition, thanks to her father's wise decision not to allow her to spend them just yet.

'My Dad won't let me touch the 
money,' she admits. 'It's for college.'

The high-schooler says she plans to study business in college, and already has grand plans beyond Fish Flops.

'Eventually I want to 
do something by myself,' she says.
