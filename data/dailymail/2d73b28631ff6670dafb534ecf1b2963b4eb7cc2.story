A carer who was caught on camera stealing money from a vulnerable pensioner's purse has been jailed. 

Sheryvone Brooks, 20, was filmed taking £30 from 85-year-old Evelyn Nicholson after her suspicious employers installed a recording device in the elderly woman's home in Stourbridge, West Midlands. 

A camera - hidden between an ornamental teapot and a box of water filters after the pensioner's money started going missing in December last year - captured crystal-clear footage of Brooks removing the purse from a kitchen drawer before taking out and pocketing the cash.

The footage shows Mrs Nicholas sitting in a chair with a cup of tea next to the drawers at her home. 

It then cuts to Brooks, who was 19 at the time, perched in the same chair and captures the moment she takes a look to see if he OAP is watching before quickly opening the drawer.

She then calmly takes out a red purse and stands up before pinching cash and stuffing it in her tracksuit pocket.

Brooks, of Sedgley, West Midlands, pleaded guilty to one count of theft at Dudley Magistrates Court on February 19.

She wept in the dock as she was sentenced to 26 weeks in a Young Offenders' Institute at Wolverhampton Crown Court.

Judge Martin Walsh told her: 'You're 20-years-old and fall to be sentenced for what was a mean and despicable offence of theft arriving out of a gross breach of trust.

'You, whilst inside her home address, stole £30 from her purse.

'The aggravating feature here is not the value of property, it's the nature of the relationship between you and the elderly person whom you were responsible for providing care for.

'The sentence is designed not only to punish you, it's also essential that other members of the profession which you are a part of understands that offences of this sort committed against vulnerable and elderly people in their home will result in an immediate prison sentence.

'It is a deterrent to others.'

The court heard the pensioner's family became suspicious when money began going missing in December last year.

Prosecutor Geoffrey Dann said Brooks admitted the offence to officers and said she had stolen the money in order to buy Christmas presents.

Mr Dann added: 'Mrs Nicholson is 85-years-old. She lives alone and she is under the care of Gateway Health and Social Care.

'The defendant was one of the carers who visited Mrs Nicholson's home on a regular basis.

'Mrs Nicholson's family ensured that she had cash and she had some money in a purse which was kept in a drawer in the kitchen.

'They noticed that money seemed to go missing. They asked Mrs Nicholson if she had given it to anyone and she hadn't.

'On January 6 the company installed a camera with the family's permission.

'The defendant attended the address on that day and she can be seen to go to the drawer, to open the drawer and take out the purse.

'The defendant was spoken to by the deputy manager and she admitted she had stolen the money.

'She was interviewed by the police on January 15 and said she she needed the money for Christmas gifts.

'She showed remorse for her actions and wanted to pay the money back.

The court heard the retired farm worker, who has 11 children, 16 grandchildren, 13 great-grandchildren and 11 great-great-grandchildren, fell ill as a result of the theft

'Mrs Nicholson's son says in his statement this offence has made his mother very ill.

'The doctor has attended her twice since the theft, it has left her feeling very vulnerable.'

Jason Aris, defending, said Brooks had faced 'embarrassment and shame' as a result of the CCTV footage of her theft being placed online.

He added: 'She has shown considerable insight into her offending behaviour.

'She identified that her actions would have left the victim feeling vulnerable in her own house.

'The CCTV footage that captures her taken the money has ended up online. This has given her a certain sense of notoriety that she didn't seek to achieve.

'This has compounded her embarrassment and shame and family and friends across the other side of the country have learned about her escapades.

'By engaging in this stupid and thoughtless behaviour, she has pretty much ensured that any possibility of work in the future is going to be difficult for her.

'She certainly won't be working in the care industry in the near future.

'The remorse that has been expressed by her is genuine. She has described the shame as all consuming.'

Speaking outside court after the hearing, Mrs Nicholson's eldest son Robert Smith, 65 said around £200 had gone missing from his mother's purse in total.

He said the retired farm worker, who has 11 children, 16 grandchildren, 13 great-grandchildren and 11 great-great-grandchildren, fell ill as a result of the theft.

Mr Smith, who works as a courier, added: 'I'm pleased with the sentence, I was hoping she was going to go down.

'She was one of the primary carers and had been going in to my mother for six months.

'I knew it was a carer, they were the only people who could have taken the money out of the drawer, but I didn't know who it was.

'My mother was devastated and it has affected her health.

'She knows one of the carers has stolen from her but she wouldn't be able to tell you which one, we have tried to keep it away from her.

'She had to go into respite for a couple of weeks because it really upset her but she is back home now and she is settling back down.

'She can't walk, she can't stand without the assistance of the carers.

'She loves the carers and with their assistance that allows her to stop at home which is what she wants.'

A spokesman for Gateway Health and Social Care Dudley confirmed Brooks had been dismissed.
