Victim: Jackie (pictured) told Rolling Stone she was violently assaulted by seven men in a fraternity house two weeks into her first year at UVA

The Rolling Stone article about an alleged gang-rape at a University of Virginia fraternity is unraveling even more as three friends who supported the victim, identified as 'Jackie', have refuted key points of the account she detailed to the magazine.

Friends Randall, Cindy and Andy (all pseudonyms) told the Washington Post that while they were featured prominently in Jackie's account of the night, they were never contacted by reporter Sabrina Rubin Erdely to give their side of the story, despite the article saying Randall turned down an interview 'citing loyalty to his own frat'.

They said they believe something traumatic happened to Jackie the night they found her distraught, but are suspicious of the story she told Rolling Stone since it contradicts both what they saw and what she initially told them happened inside the Phi Kappa Psi house the night of September 28, 2012. 

In the explosive article, which prompted the university to shut down all Greek life until January, Jackie describes how in her first semester, she was lured to the frat by a brother named 'Drew' who she met working as a lifeguard at the university pool.

She says the junior asked her out for dinner and a date function at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, and she accepted.  

Back at the house, Drew invited her to an upstairs bedroom, where things took a gruesome turn as she was thrown onto a glass table which shattered and then raped by seven men one after the other in what appeared to be an initiation ritual.

When she later came to early Saturday morning, Jackie described fleeing the house barefoot and calling her new friends Randall, Cindy and Andy to come find her.

Wrong: Jackie identified Phi Kappa Psi -known as Phi Psi for short - as the frat house where the attack took place but told the Washington Post she only did so because a friend pointed to it a year later and told her: 'That's where it happened.' Her father said she had got the detail wrong

Perhaps the most heartbreaking part of the article is how Jackie describes the trio's reaction to seeing her bleeding and in shock.

Shaken by the events, she waits as the three discuss whether to report the rape to police, speaking about how it would impact their social lives, the boys' plans to pledge a fraternity and Jackie's college reputation.

But in separate interviews with the Washington Post, all three refute this cold description of their behavior. 

Randall, Cindy and Andy say they found Jackie crying and clearly traumatized, saying her date drove her back to his fraternity, asked her to come inside and then forced her to perform oral sex on five men. 

Horrified by the story, the three say they urged Jackie to report the incident to police, but that she declined and asked to go back to her dorm where two of them spent the night comforting her.

'I mean obviously we were very concerned for her,' Andy told the Post. 'We tried to be as supportive as we could be.' 

They also added that Jackie did not appear to be injured, despite her account that she was bleeding significantly from being thrown through a glass table.

Further, they also had doubts about her attacker.

This past week, Jackie finally named the lifeguard who took her back to the frat to her new friends, but when a reporter gave Randall, Cindy and Andy that name, they said they had never heard of it before. 

University of Virginia officials also found the name suspect, saying that no one with that name has ever attended the school. The Post interviewed a man with a similar name, and he admitted to working at the pool with her, he says he never met her in person and was not a member of Phi Psi.

The fraternity released a separate statement saying no Phi Psi brother was working at the aquatic center at that time and that they didn't hold an official social event on the weekend in question. 

At the time, Jackie's friends were under the impression that her date was a junior she met through her chemistry class that year.

Jackie started talking about this mystery man when Randall rebuffed her romantic advances, wanting to stay friends. 

When she revealed that an older student in her chemistry class had been asking her out on dates,  the three friends say they took his number from her phone out of curiosity and started texting the stranger.

The person they talked to wrote about 'this super smart hot' freshman and how they both shared of a love of the band Coheed and Cambria, according to the two-year-old messages shown to the Post.

'I really like this girl,' the guy said in one message. He also sent pictures of himself, showing he had a distinct jawline and blue eyes. 

But the messages also hinted at Jackie's crush on Randall, since the student wrote that she was interested in someone else and refused to date her. 

'Get this she said she likes some other 1st year guy who dosnt (sp) like her and turned her down but she wont date me cause she likes him. She cant turn my down fro some nerd 1st yr. she said this kid is smart and funny and worth it,' the older student wrote.

Eventually, Jackie told her friends that she succumbed and accepted a date from the older student for Friday, September 28, 2012.

Adding even more mystery to the already confusing story, the Post identified the man in the text messages from his pictures, and it turns out he went to high school with Jackie in northern Virginia. 

However, that man, now a junior at a school in a different state, says he  'never really spoke with her', did not attend UVA, was not a member of any fraternity and hadn't been to Charlottesville in at least six years. 

On the specific weekend when Jackie  said she was raped, he was at an athletic event in a different state, and the pictures of him that were messaged to Jackie's friends appear to have been pulled from his social media accounts.

Jackie's friends also had a hard time finding her crush on social media, adding that they never met him in person and now fear they had never been messaging with him in the first place. 

While they are skeptical of details of the night described in the Rolling Stone article, they all agree that something happened to leave Jackie terrified. 

'She had very clearly just experienced a horrific trauma,' Randall said.

'I had never seen anybody acting like she was on that night before and I really hope I never have to again. ... If she was acting on the night of Sept. 28, 2012, then she deserves an Oscar.

Both Randall and Andy say they've been interviewed by the Charlottesville Police, who were asked by the university to start an investigation into the alleged incident. 

Rolling Stone has issued an apology for the story, initially saying their trust in Jackie was 'misplaced'. 

They have stopped commenting on the article, while conducting an internal review. 

On Wednesday, the lawyer representing Jackie asked reporters to stop contacting her and her family. 

 'As I am sure you all can understand, all of this has been very stressful, overwhelming and retraumatizing for Jackie and her family,' Jackie's lawyer Palma Pustilnik said.
