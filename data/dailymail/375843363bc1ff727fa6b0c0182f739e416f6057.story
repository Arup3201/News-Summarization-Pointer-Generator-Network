Militant union chief Bob Crow last night defended his six-figure salary, declaring he was 'serving civilisation' in his role

Militant union chief Bob Crow last night defended his six-figure salary, declaring he was ‘serving civilisation’ in his role.

When asked about his £145,000 pay packet the RMT boss, whose tenure has been marked by a series of rail and tube strikes, insisted he was ‘worth it’.

Mr Crow came under fire during an interview for living in a housing association home in North London despite his high earnings.

But when questioned over the salary, he told BBC Radio Four: ‘I am worth it, yeah. Our members, in the main, have had pay rises every single year right the way through austerity.’

On MPs’ pay, he added: ‘Anyone in the public sector, we are all civil servants, we are serving civilisation.

'That is what a civil servant does, and they should be paid accordingly. I do believe they [MPs] should have a pay rise.’

Challenged over his decision to remain a council tenant, he told BBC Radio Four’s PM programme: ‘I’m the only person in my road paying the rent - everyone else is on social.

'Every single person down my road - because there are only nine houses - is on benefits.

‘Who really is the mug?’

Last year Mr Crow claimed he had ‘no moral duty at all’ to move out of his rented council house, despite suggestions from ministers that wealthy tenants should quit to free up space for the poor.

Mr Crow, who was interviewed over a three-course lunch at Westminster’s fashionable Inn the Park restaurant, claimed to be a ‘communist socialist’ who believed in ‘a society that is based on need rather than greed’.

He also backed controversial plans to hand MPs an 11 per cent pay rise, saying they should not have to ‘live in a tent.’

David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg have all condemned plans to increase MPs’ pay to £74,000 after the 2015 election.

But Mr Crow said: ‘Anyone in the public sector - we are all civil servants, we are serving civilisation. That is what a civil servant does, and they should be paid accordingly. I do believe they [MPs] should have a pay rise.

‘Some people might think that these MPs should live in a tent, they should have four to a room.

‘I
 want my MP, particularly those who don’t live in London who’ve got to 
travel down into work in London, to have decent accommodation to go home
 to. I want them to have a proper meal, I don’t want them to scramble 
around the place.

‘I do believe that the MPs should be paid adequately because what you will get, in my view, is a lot of people not going into parliament because they’ll say that we’re going to lose out.’

Asked about his own salary, which he suggested was closer to £90,000 before his pension and other benefits are included, he said: ‘I am worth it, yeah. Our members, in the main, have had pay rises every single year right the way through austerity. They have got good pensions, good holidays. They could be better...’

His comments are likely to infuriate commuters, who have faced severe disruption from RMT strikes designed to protect and boost the pay and conditions of Mr Crow’s members.
