The BBC was yesterday condemned by the spending watchdog for paying its staff £24million to move to Salford without asking for receipts to prove their relocation expenses claims.

MPs accused the corporation of overseeing a ‘colossal waste of money’ after the National Audit Office found 894 staff were handed an average of £23,000 each, inlcuding 11 who received more than £100,000 for homes worth between £500,000 and £1million.

The money was to compensate them for the cost of moving to the BBC’s new £1billion headquarters. However, they did not have to provide basic evidence of train fares or utility bills to back up their expense claims.

The BBC's decision to pay generous allowances to persuade staff to move to the Media City in Salford has been criticised by the National Audit Office

The BBC spent a total of £150,000 on moving just one member of staff to Greater Manchester.

The generous ‘relocation allowances’ mean the total cost of moving BBC staff is to rise to more than twice the estimate of £11million.

Hundreds claimed up to £1,900 a month to cover all rent, bills and council tax in Salford, while others received £3,000 to buy new curtains and carpets.

The influential Public Accounts Committee of MPs promised to investigate the corporation’s financial affairs as it was revealed:

Tory MP Philip Davies, who sits on the Culture Media and Sport select committee, said: ‘This report shows what we already knew, which is that the move to Salford is a colossal waste of money.’

The National Audit Office (NAO) report criticised the BBC for imposing ‘inadequate’ controls over its relocation payments to staff. It also said many aspects of the BBC’s relocation package were ‘unusual’ and ‘more generous than it normally offers’.

BBC Breakfast was among the programmes to move from London to Greater Manchester

Staff who do not wish to move to Salford permanently can instead commute there – a 200-mile journey from London – for two years and receive £1,900 a month to cover the cost of renting an apartment in the city.

But they were not asked provide train tickets or utility bills to prove their expense claims. The NAO report said: ‘The BBC did not apply a consistent approach to checking that relocating staff had actually incurred the costs that they were claiming.

‘The BBC did not ask staff to provide evidence that they owned a home and were therefore entitled to homeowners’ allowances until after payments started. Staff on the remote location allowance had to provide copies of their rental agreements or hotel bills but not receipts for train travel or utilities.’

Peter Salmon, head of BBC North, said he thought the move to Salford was a 'positive' step

Depending on what relocation package they chose, BBC staff were given a cash payment of £5,000 and 10 per cent of their salary as an ‘incentive’ to move.

Those who sold their homes and bought property in Salford were offered a financial guarantee meaning they would receive at least 85 per cent of the market value of their old home.

But despite the already generous terms, many staff members were allowed to claim back more than the BBC’s standard relocation policy normally allows.

The NAO found these special exceptions ‘had not been documented’ while reasons for the decisions to grant them were ‘unclear or missing’. The BBC Trust admitted that some of the lapses in financial control were ‘unacceptable’ but insisted all payments have since been audited, revealing ‘no irregularities’.

Anthony Fry, chairman of the BBC Trust’s finance committee, said the NAO report found the total relocation cost of £224million was £9million under budget.

Public Accounts Committee chairman Margaret Hodge said her committee will travel to Salford next month for a special hearing into the NAO report. Peter Salmon said he was permanantly based in Salford and renting at his own expense.

The move of Radio Five Live, BBC Sport, children’s programmes and BBC Breakfast from London to Salford was initially suggested by Greg Dyke in 2004 when he was director general. He claimed he wanted to address concerns that the corporation was too ‘London-centric’.

The BBC has estimated its move to Salford could create an additional 15,000 jobs in the region through added spending. However it has directly recruited just 254 staff from Greater Manchester, including 39 from Salford.
