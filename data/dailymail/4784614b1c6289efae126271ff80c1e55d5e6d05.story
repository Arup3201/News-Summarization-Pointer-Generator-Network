France's former first lady Carla Bruni was secretly recorded complaining about losing 'fabulous contracts' when she was France's first lady.

The multi-millionaire heiress, who is notorious for her high living, is also heard complaining about having to 'keep' her much poorer husband who was ousted as president in May 2012 by Socialist candidate François Hollande.

In the recording, made in 2011 by a senior aide to Mr Sarkozy, Ms Bruni-Sarkozy said she looked forward to making money out of selling 'wrinkle cream' like US stars Julia Roberts and Sharon Stone, it emerged today.

Ms Bruni-Sarkozy, who gave up most of her commercial activities when she became Mr Sarkozy's third wife, said: 'I had fabulous contracts, and then nothing at all.

'Afterwards, I’m going to sign new contracts. I am not going to wait terribly long. If I can manage a cool little contract.'

Ms Bruni-Sarkozy, whose heyday was as a 
model in the 1990s, adds: 'You agree, they’re not going to sell 
anti-wrinkle cream to a girl of 22, right? Julia Roberts, 44, Sharon 
Stone, 52, Julianne Moore 53.

'All those are fabulous contracts, no? I 
can’t do it for the moment, because it’s not done.'

Mr Sarkozy then interrupts the jovial conversation, saying:  'I tell you, my future is to run the cash register.'

The embarrassing secret recordings highlight
 the greed of a couple who were notorious for their 'bling bling' 
lifestyle at the Elysee Palace.

Since leaving office in 2012 Mr Sarkozy has faced a range of corruption inquiries, all related to racking in millions of euros in cash illegally

Since leaving office Mr Sarkozy has 
faced a range of corruption enquiries, all related to racking in 
millions of euros in cash illegally.

The recordings were made by Patrick Buisson, a journalist friend of Mr Sarkozy's, who is now accused of betraying his trust.

Mr Buisson can be heard in the tapes, 
leaked by the Canard Enchaine investigative magazine, referring to Mr 
Sarkozy as 'the dwarf”.

There are now calls for a parliamentary inquiry into the secret recordings.
