Noah sailed past Jacob to become the most popular baby name for boys in 2013, ending Jacob's 14-year run at the top. Sophia was the most popular baby name for girls for the third straight year.

The Social Security Administration announced the most popular baby names Friday. Noah was followed by Liam, Jacob, Mason and William. Sophia was followed by Emma, Olivia, Isabella and Ava.

The rise of Noah and Liam highlights a trend toward more smooth-sounding baby names, said Laura Wattenberg, creator of Babynamewizard.com.

Popular picks: Noah sailed past Jacob to become the top baby name for boys in 2013, ending Jacob's 14-year run at number one. Sophia was the most popular baby name for girls for the third straight year

'You compare Jacob with all its hard, punchy consonants, versus Noah and Liam, you can really see where style is heading,' Ms Wattenberg said.

She also noted that the most popular baby names aren't nearly as popular as they used to be. For example, a little more than 18,000 babies born last year were named Noah. In 1950, when James was number one, there were more than 86,000 newborns with that name.

About 21,000 newborns were named Sophia last year. In 1950, more than 80,000 were named Linda, the top name for girls that year.

'In the past, most parents were picking from a pretty well-defined set of names,' Ms Wattenberg said. 'Literally for hundreds of years, the English royal names dominated. You had John and Mary and James and Elizabeth.

'Today,' she said, 'we get names everywhere.'

These baby naming trends certainly seem to have taken hold in Hollywood.

In the past two years alone, three prominent celebrities have named their newborn sons Noah: Megan Fox, whose son with Brian Austin Green was born in September 2012, Michael Buble, who had a boy with wife Luisana Lopilato in August 2013, and Alessandra Ambrosio, who gave birth to Noah Phoenix Ambrosio Mazur in May 2012.

Pamela Satran, founder of Nameberry.com, said of these monikers: 'We see the rise of Noah and Liam and the endurance of Sophia and Emma as a sign of great gender equality when it comes to parents' choice of baby names.

'Boys' names are becoming more ruled by pop culture and fashion, traditionally the domain of girls' names,' she told MailOnline.

'Girls' names are becoming more rooted in tradition and inspired by strong historic namesakes.'

She added that the many of the top 
names are easy to pronounce in multiple languages, adding to their 
appeal in an increasingly globalized society.

Jacob first rose to number one in 1999. In the 45 years before that, Michael was king for all but one.

There
 has been a lot more variety among the girls. Mary dominated the first 
half of the 20th century. But in the past two decades, Emily, Emma, 
Isabella and Jessica have all spent time at the top.

The Social Security Administration's 
website provides lists of the top 1,000 baby names for each year, dating
 to 1880. The top baby names that year were John and Mary. John is now 
number 27 and Mary has fallen to number 121.

Social Security also charts the 
fastest-rising names each year. These names may not be in the top ten or
 even the top 100, but they moved up more spots than any other.

For girls, the runaway winner was Daleyza, which jumped a whopping 3,130 spots, to number 585. Daleyza is the name of the young daughter of Larry Hernandez, a singer who stars in a Spanish-language reality TV show called Larrymania.

'Reality TV is one of the biggest style makers today because it gives us a constant new stream of names from all over the place,' Ms Wattenberg said.

For boys, the fastest rising name was Jayceon, which jumped 845 spots, to number 206. Two hip hop artists are named Jayceon. One simply goes by the name Jayceon. The other, Jayceon Terrell Taylor, is a rapper who goes by the stage name The Game.
