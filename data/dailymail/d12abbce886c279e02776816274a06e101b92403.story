Disgraced Christian lawmaker Vance McAllister, who was caught on video in a steamy clinch with a female staffer, is requesting an FBI investigation today into the breach which led to a surveillance tape being leaked from his office.

McAllister's chief of staff Adam Terry said on Wednesday that the Louisiana congressman will send a letter to House Speaker John Boehner asking that the leak from his Monroe district office be investigated at a federal level.

The tape, which emerged on Monday, showed McAllister, a married father-of-five, kissing married staffer Melissa Peacock inside his darkened office. Mrs Peacock, 33, has since 'voluntarily resigned' from her position.

Mr Terry told the News Star: 'Clearly, what the congressman did 
was wrong, and he’s taking responsibility for his actions. However, a breach in security in a federal office is a grave concern 
for us.'

A church minister claimed on Tuesday that McAllister's office manager in Monroe was the one who leaked the security tape.

Danny
 Chance, of Christian Life Church, claimed that staffer Leah Gordon had planned to take the security tape to state senator Mike Walsworth and Jonathan Johnson, a 
former employee of Representative Rodney Alexander.

Mr Chance told the News Star that he was not defending McAllister's actions but felt there was a 'conspiracy to bring Vance down and destroy him'.

Mr Walsworth and Mr Johnson, who worked for McAllister's opponent State Senator Neil Riser, denied ever seeing the video.

MailOnline requested a comment from Mr Chance on his allegations today and was awaiting a response.

Ms Gordon, who worked on Rep. Alexander's staff before she was hired by McAllister, was unavailable for comment on the allegations.

A spokesman at McAllister's Monroe office refused to comment on the allegations to MailOnline today.

Ms Gordon remains employed by McAllister and had denied the allegations that she 
was the leak to his chief of staff. Calls to the landlord of 
McAllister's political headquarters also went unanswered today.

Louisiana Democrat Robert Johnson says McAllister should resign because he has embarrassed the state

In a statement issued on Monday, McAllister said: 'There's no doubt I've fallen short and 
I'm asking for forgiveness. I'm asking for forgiveness from God, my 
wife, my kids, my staff, and my constituents who elected me to serve. 

'Trust is something I know has to be 
earned whether your a husband, a father, or a congressman. I promise to 
do everything I can to earn back the trust of everyone I've 
disappointed.'

Opinions are
 mixed over whether McAllister should resign following the scandal 
which has thrown the GOP politician, who ran on a ticket of Christian 
family values, into the media spotlight.

Republicans
 were keeping their distance on Tuesday but House Majority Leader Eric 
Cantor said he was pleased McAllister offered an apology.

Cantor
 declined to say whether he thought the Louisiana congressman should 
remain in the job, as McAllister offered no statement about his future 
plans and the fall-out threat to his November re-election.

Others
 were not so reserved. Louisiana State Representative, Democrat Robert 
Johnson, who lost to McAllister in the November election, told nola: 'This is another embarrassment to Louisiana. I think he needs to resign, and I don't think he can be effective.'

He also added that it was 'not a secret' that he wanted McAllister's job.

McAllister's
 spokeswoman Jennifer Dunagin said that the woman that 
McAllister was caught kissing, Mrs Peacock, 'voluntarily resigned 
effective yesterday'.

Her 
husband Heath Peacock said on Tuesday said that the revelations of his 
wife's cheating has destroyed his life and his marriage is over.

Mr Peacock told The Ouachita Citizen today: 'I’m
 just freaking devastated by the whole deal, man. I loved my wife so 
much. I cannot believe this. I cannot freaking believe it. I feel like 
I’m going to wake up here in a minute and this is all going to be a bad 
nightmare.'

He added: 'He has wrecked my life. We are headed for divorce.'

The
 34-year-old was informed of his wife's infidelity only a few hours 
before the scandal went public on Monday. The couple have been married 
for six years and have a six-year-old son.

Mr Peacock, who donated $10,000 to McAllister's campaign fund, says his wife no longer works for the politician. He added that he has yet to receive a personal apology from McAllister.

The
 McAllisters and Peacocks have been friends for many years. Facebook 
pictures posted online to Kelly McAllister's profile show both couples 
together at a birthday party in 2009.

The two men grew up three miles apart and they both graduated in 1990 from the same high school. McAllister
 also worked with Mr Peacock over a 16-year period for Mustang 
Engineering, a Texas-based oil and gas company.

On
 the video tape,  McAllister is seen on the tape wearing a crumpled, 
purple shirt. He turns off the lights in the room before a woman with 
long, dark hair and is wearing a beige trench coat, short skirt and 
knee-high boots, comes to stand beside him.

The
 couple peck each other on the lips then have a long, lingering kiss. 
The man then sets what appears to be an alarm panel on the wall and both
 leave the building.

They
 are both caught on an outside security camera exiting the building, the
 woman first and then McAllister. When they get to the driveway of the 
building, they separate.

McAllister, a veteran and businessman, 
entered the House of Representatives in November after campaigning on a 
ticket of Christian, family values.

He
 has been married to wife Kelly Duncan McAllister for 17 years. The 
couple have five children and live in rural Swartz, east of Monroe in 
Louisiana.

Their 
oldest daughter Anna Claire Rogers, 19, was adopted by the McAllisters 
in 2010 and now attends the University of Louisiana at Monroe.

They have four other children Emilie Katherine, 12, Duncan Michael, nine, Vance, five, and three-year-old Eva Grace.

McAllister, played up his membership of the North Monroe Baptist Church during his congressional campaign.

McAllister’s campaign benefited from support from the Robertson family 
of Duck Dynasty fame. Phil Robertson publicly supported McAllister 
while Willie Robertson endorsed McAllister in a YouTube video.

He describes his decision to run for
 Congress as a 'prayerful one. Many people make light of my spiritual 
faith, but that is okay with me. I know the blessing that I have 
received from the good Lord and the inner peace that comes from being a 
believer'.

He went on:
 'I knew there were a number of qualified people in the district to be 
congressman, but also I realized that I had the time and the financial 
capability ... that maybe [the others] didn't.'
