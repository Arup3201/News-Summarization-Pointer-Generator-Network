One of three American students arrested during violent protests in Cairo has described his first hours in custody as 'probably the scariest night of my life ever'.

Derrick Sweeney, 19, from Jefferson City, Missouri, described how he was punched in the face, threatened with guns and forced to lay for hours in the dark in a foetal position.

Sweeney arrived at St. Louis 
International airport, Missouri late on Saturday, as 19-year-old Gregory Porter and
21-year-old Luke Gates also landed back on American soil.

Egyptian authorities said they had arrested the students a week earlier near Cairo's iconic Tahrir Square for throwing firebombs at Egyptian security forces amid violent protests.

But Sweeney said he and the other Americans ‘never did anything to hurt anyone’ and never were on the rooftop nor had handled or thrown any explosives. He called those accusations ‘100 per cent lies’.

‘The first night was probably the scariest night of my life ever. I was not sure I was going to live,’ he told AP.

‘They said if we moved at all, even an inch, they would shoot us. They were behind us with guns.’

‘They held a bottle of gasoline to my 
mouth motioning as if I was going to drink it,’ he added when he spoke 
to Good Morning America this morning.

The students spent about six hours curled up in a near fetal position with their hands tied behind their backs, he said.

But conditions markedly improved after the opening night's ordeal when they were moved to some other ‘legitimate’ jail, he said.

‘There was really marked treatment between the first night and the next three nights or however long it was,’ he said.

‘The first night, it was kind of 
rough. They were hitting us; they were saying they were going to shoot 
us and they were putting us in really uncomfortable positions.

‘But
after that first night, we were treated in a just manner -- as a 
prisoner -- we were given food when we needed and it was OK after that 
first night.’

They were given food when they needed it and allowed contact with a U.S. embassy official, Sweeney added.

Despite the treatment, Sweeney, who attends Georgetown University, said he was glad he went to the protests.

‘I would still say going to the protests was a smart decision,’ he told Good Morning America. ‘I could’ve stayed farther away from the more violent scenes.’

His mother Joy Sweeney said she supported his decision to go.

‘It’s what students do all the time,’ she told GMA. ‘I haven’t always made the safest decision in my life. I want my children to live their life and not sit on the sidelines.’

All three young men were studying at the American University in Cairo.

An Egyptian court ordered the students' release Thursday, and they were on flights out of Cairo two days later. All men were greeted by their anxious family members as they arrived in their home states.

On arriving in Indianapolis, Luke Gates said: ‘I'm not going to take this as a negative experience. It's still a great country.’

A spokesperson said he spoke to Gates' father, Bill Gates, shortly after his son boarded a flight out of Egypt.

‘He said he was doing very well and he was very excited to be on his way home,’ the spokesman said.

Nineteen-year-old Gregory Porter was greeted by his parents and other relatives when his flight landed in Philadelphia. He is from nearby Glenside, Pennsylvania.

‘We're thrilled that he's home,’ said Sharon Sloan of Newtown, Pennsylvania, one of the relatives at the airport. ‘We think it's a miracle, definitely an answer to prayer.’

Protests have been going on in Cairo since Nov. 19, in anticipation of the landmark parliamentary elections due to start Monday.

On Friday, the crowd in Tahrir Square grew to more than 100,000 people, and thousands remained there Saturday.
