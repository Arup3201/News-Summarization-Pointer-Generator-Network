Bayern Munich midfielder Toni Kroos is in line to sign for Manchester United for £20million this summer.

The Germany midfielder will be United's 'go-to' player and for that sort of money they will expect big things.

Here, Sportsmail columnist Martin Keown gives the lowdown on the 24-year-old...

Done deal: Manchester United have agreed a deal to sign Bayern Munich midfielder Toni Kroos for £20m

The Transfer

Toni Kroos is a good bit of business for Manchester United, but he is only the first piece of the jigsaw. They still need to bring in reinforcements across the squad if they want to get back to where they were. However, a signing like this does show the power United still have.

People questioned whether being out of the Champions League next season would affect their ability to buy top names. Well, here’s your answer. 

It’s good to get any transfers done before a World Cup so that the player’s mind is clear, and it’s particularly helpful if that player goes on to play a starring role in the tournament.

But it is interesting that a club like Bayern was happy to let him go – you would have thought it would be any young German player’s dream to want to stay and win trophies at the best club in the country. Plenty of European clubs will have been interested in him but he is the marquee signing that could start the ball rolling for United.

The Player

There
 is no doubting Kroos’ ability. He is a quality passer of the ball, he 
can defend and he has excellent vision. United want to play quick, 
incisive football and Kroos is a good place to start. He keeps things 
simple, always has time in possession and with his range of passing, 
United will hope he could fill a Paul Scholes-shaped hole in their 
midfield.

His
 performance against Arsenal in the Champions League made people sit up 
and take notice – he completed 147 passes, only 11 less than the entire Gunners team put together – but it’s important to remember he was 
playing against 10 men for a large part of that game. He also only 
scored four goals in 51 appearances this season, so he is not exactly 
prolific. 

Sometimes
 he floats in and out of matches and with Philipp Lahm often playing 
deep in that Bayern midfield, Kroos was not their go-to player. He will 
need to fulfil that role at United.

If he plays in a midfield two, and 
at the minute he would likely partner Michael Carrick, he would need to 
work on his mobility. Yaya Toure and Fernandinho have set the benchmark 
for all-action midfield pairings and United have to find their own 
combination. Kroos can be part of that but he will need an energetic 
partner.

The Manager

Pep
 Guardiola was obviously in no rush to keep Kroos, and the German is not
 your typical Guardiola midfielder. He does not have as low a centre of 
gravity as the likes of Xavi or Andres Iniesta and plays in a slightly 
more upright style. But Kroos does have the advantage of having worked 
under Louis van Gaal before.

It
 was the Dutchman who gave Kroos his breakthrough at Bayern in 2010-11, 
and he will know about Kroos’ pedigree. The midfielder, too, will know 
all about Van Gaal’s attacking philosophy and also his colourful 
dressing room manner, which can only help him adapt to life in England.

It is a decent signing for United and the fans will be pleased to see 
that even though there is a lot of work to be done defensively with the 
squad, Van Gaal’s first instinct is still to focus on attacking 
football.
