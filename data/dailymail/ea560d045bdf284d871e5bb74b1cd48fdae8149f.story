The parliamentary head of Angela Merkel's party has warned that crisis-wracked Greece has 'no room for manoeuvre' ahead of talks this week between the German chancellor and the Greek prime minister.

Prime Minister Antonis Samaras is due
to visit Berlin on Friday before heading to Paris for talks with French
President Francois Hollande the next day.

According to Greek media, Samaras 
will discuss extending a deadline for Greece to make budget cuts in return for its next slice of aid 
while stopping short of making a formal request.

The Financial Times reported today that Samaras would ask for two more years to make the demanded cuts.

But Volker Kauder, parliamentary group leader of Merkel's conservative bloc, told Der Spiegel weekly: 'The Greeks have to stick to what they have promised. There is no room for manoeuvre, either in terms of time or substance.

'That would be yet another agreement broken. That's exactly what led us to this crisis.'

Greece's debt stands at more than 300 
billion euros ($372 billion), and its economy is struggling through a 
fifth year of recession with unemployment above 23 percent.

In an interview published today, Samaras insisted
that Athens doesn't want more money from creditors, but made clear it 
would like more time to enact reforms and spending cuts. 

He vehemently rejected the suggestion
that it might be better for Greece to leave the 17-nation euro and 
bring back its former currency, the drachma.

That, he told Germany's mass-circulation Bild daily, would result in 'a catastrophe for Greece' and economic collapse. 

Samaras pledged before coming to 
power to seek a two-year extension to the deadline for implementing 
unpopular cuts demanded in exchange for two massive international aid 
packages worth 240 billion euros that are keeping Greece afloat. 

But delays in implementing reforms 
and austerity measures have fueled impatience in Germany - the largest 
single contributor to the bailouts - and other eurozone countries.

German officials and lawmakers have 
made clear they're in no mood to grant significant concessions, and 
speculation has grown that Greece will have to leave the euro. 

Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, who chairs the eurozone finance ministers' meetings, was due in Athens today.

'Let me be very clear: we are not asking for extra money,' Samaras was quoted as telling Bild.

'We stand by our commitments and the 
implementation of all requirements. But we must encourage growth, 
because that reduces the financing gaps.

'All we want is a little "air to 
breathe" to get the economy going and increase state income,' Samaras 
added, without specifying any timeframe.

'More time does not automatically mean more money.'

Asked whether Greece needs a second 
debt writedown following one carried through earlier this year, Samaras 
replied: 'that has never been discussed.'

Some German politicians have talked 
openly in recent weeks about the possibility of Greece leaving the euro,
and the vice chancellor, Economy Minister Philipp Roesler, has said 
that the idea of a Greek exit has 'lost its horror.'

But Athens insists the country must 
remain in the euro - something which opinion polls have shown the vast 
majority of Greeks want. 

Asked by Bild whether a return to the
drachma would be better, Samaras replied that 'the consequences would 
be a catastrophe for Greece.'

'It would mean at least five more 
years of recession and push unemployment above 40 percent,' he was 
quoted as saying. 'A nightmare for Greece: economic collapse, social 
unrest and an unprecedented crisis of democracy.'

Auditors from the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund -- known as the Troika -- will release a report in mid-September on Greece's progress towards achieving the required austerity.

According to Der Spiegel, this report will call for Athens to slash 14 billion euros ($17 billion) from its budget over the next two years, 2.5 billion euros more than originally demanded.

Der Spiegel said the extra cuts were needed because planned privatisations were not shaping up to be as lucrative as hoped and tax revenues were falling short of forecasts as Greece struggles through its fifth year of recession.

Kauder reiterated that Europe should strive to keep Greece in the eurozone, but stressed that the Troika report would be the basis for further decisions.

'We should do everything to stick together. When the first difficulties appear, you don't throw the children out of the house. I am going to wait to see what the Troika says,' Kauder said.
