Drunk driver: Marco Antonio Dominguez, 24, told a cop he would join ISIS and then return to kill him

A drunk driver told a cop who he was planning to join ISIS and threatened that when he did he would return to kill him.

Marco Antonio Dominguez, 24, from Hendersonville, Tennessee, was stopped on suspicion of being under the influence overnight.

When he was arrested for DUI, he told the officer while in the back of the patrol car: 'I am going to join ISIS and when I do, you will be the first person I kill'.

According to the arrest report, he continued to threaten the officers saying: 'Why don't you take these handcuffs off and (I'll) show you what I am made of,' according to the report.

Officers who arrived said he had slurred speech, was unsteady on his feet and had vomit all over his pants.

At the time he was standing outside his vehicle which had a smashed-in windshield which police believe was caused by him hitting a sign on Interstate 65. 

Arrest reports state that Dominguez pulled over at a gas station at West Trinity Lane, outside a Subway restaurant. 

Dominguez was charged with drunk driving, assault, driving without a license, and leaving the scene of an accident.

Dominguez, who is locked up on $20,000 bond, is scheduled for a court hearing today.

Officers who arrived in the parking lot of this gas station and Subway restaurant in Hendersonville, Tennessee, said he had slurred speech, was unsteady on his feet and had vomit all over his pants.
