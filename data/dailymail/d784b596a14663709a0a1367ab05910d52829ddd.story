An assistant principal and an administrator have been accused of sexually assaulting and stealing from underage students at a Brooklyn high school.

William Abreu, assistant principal at Progress High School, has been accused of raping a 17-year-old student in his office in 2009 and abusing others. Juan Martinez, the administrator of an after-school program, has been accused of forcing a 16-year-old girl to perform oral sex on him in his office in 2011 and abusing other students, according to investigators.

The men are accused of sharing the girls they abused and Abreu even stole over $1,000 from the mother of the girl he raped, Department of Education Special Commissioner for Investigation Richard J. Condon said in a report released Wednesday.

Mr Abreu and Mr Williams, according to the report, conspired to scare the girls into not ratting on their perverse, ongoing sexual abuse – even using the immigration status of one victim against her.

The graphic report, which leaves nothing to the imagination, says that Mr Abreu ‘forcibly raped a 17-year-old female recent Progress High graduate (‘Student B’) in his school office.’

Mr Martinez ‘forced a then 16-year-old female student (‘Student A’) to perform oral sex on him in his office at Progress High,’ the report said, before adding that both men sexually abused the students.

Mr Condon’s report then goes into detail describing the depraved molestation of both students and on-going sexual advances made by the school administrators.

After offering student A an after-school job, the girl was told by Abreu that having sex with both him and Martinez was a condition of her employment, according to the report.

‘It’s even more horrifying because they were sharing these girls,’ Mr Condon told NY1. ‘One pervert is bad enough, when you have one person having sex with a girl and sending her onto another person.’

As if not craven enough, Abreu then ‘asked the student to have sex with others in exchange for money,’ the report said.

‘Apparently, Abreu also propositioned the one girl that he would take her on trips with him and have her have sex with other people – and she would get paid for that,’ Mr Condon added.Student B, the girl Abreu raped in his office, was an undocumented immigrant, which led Mr Abreu down an even darker path to coercion.

Mr Abreu offered to help the girl fix her immigration status, saying he could help her find a lawyer to sort out the paperwork, ‘but she would have to pay for the attorney,’ according to the report.

When the girl objected, saying she couldn’t afford the fees, Abreu replied ‘Well, you could be my girlfriend,’ said the report. After she declined, that’s when Abreu forced her onto a couch and said ‘if you don’t allow me to touch you, I will have to call Immigration,’ before fondling the girl over her clothes, then undressed and raped the helpless student, the report detailed.

‘If you don't come back, I am going to have to go to Immigration,’ Abreu said after committing the horrific act of betrayal, according to the report

Mr Abreu continued to molest the girl until sending her to Mr Martinez after she refused to comply with his requests about a month later, the report said. When the tortured girl fought off Martinez’s advances, Abreu set his sights on another target, the girl’s mother.

Not just sexual abuse: Mr Abreu is also accused of stealing $1,500 from the mother of his rape victim

Saying that he could introduce an attorney to help student b address her immigration status, Mr Abreu invited her mother to his office and told her to bring $1,500 in cash, the report explained.

The abused girl’s mother was introduced to a ‘Hyman Rodriguez’ at the school, in Brooklyn's Williamsburg section, and paid him $1,500 to help with her daughter’s immigration struggles, said the report. The woman never heard from Mr Rodriguez or Abreu again, and Abreu did not return any of her messages, she told investigators.

Both men declined to be interviewed by Mr Condon’s office, the report said.

This is not the first instance of Mr Abreu being accused of sexual conduct with students. Just last year, the now-suspended assistant principal was accused of sexually abusing three 15-year-old students at the same high school, according to NY1.

Both men have also been accused of coming on to students and encouraging them to dress provocatively in the past as well, according to multiple reports.

The accused pervert was ‘convinced’ those accusations were going to go away and ready to move on with his life, close friends told NY1.

The Kings County (Brooklyn) District Attorney’s office is looking into the incidents and considering filing criminal charges, reported NY1.

The New York City Department of Education, Mr Condon, and attorneys for both men could not immediately be reached by MailOnline for comment.
