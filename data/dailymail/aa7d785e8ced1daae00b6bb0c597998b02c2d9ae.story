Pictures have emerged of the chilling bullet-riddled gun target pinned to the wall of the home George Zimmerman used to share with his wife Shellie.

The target was punctured with 17 holes and was discovered by the acquitted murderer's estranged wife in their Lake Mary, Florida, home after Zimmerman was forced to move out.

'This is the photo that Shellie sent to her lawyer, saying "Look at 
the subliminal message George left me", following their showdown in 
September,' a source with intimate knowledge of the situation told RadarOnline.

'What else could a bullet-riddled marksman’s target mean?'

Not so subtle: Shellie sent a picture of the target to her lawyer saying 'look at the subliminal message George left'

Message? The target was left on an empty wall

Another source told the website: 'It’s
really not that subliminal. A not-so subtle message, I think.

'It was 
clearly a threat. Did George feel so threatened by Shellie talking to 
the media about her marriage to George?

'Did he feel threatened that she 
didn’t stick to the playbook of refusing to talk after Trayvon? Or was 
this George’s way of telling Shellie to stick to the [code of silence]?

'Or was it something more serious? George really has some explaining to do.'

It emerged last week that no criminal
charges will be filed against Zimmerman in a September dispute with his
estranged wife after officers decided it did not rise to a criminal 
level.

It came just days after Shellie filed divorce papers and took place in the same home, owned by Shellie Zimmerman’s parents, the target was found in.

A video taken at the time of the September 9 incident shows the dramatic moment that police swarmed 
Zimmerman's car and ordered him to get down on his knees before taking 
him into custody following the September 9 incident.

The video, 
recorded by a police cruiser's dash cam, surfaced days later, as Zimmerman's
lawyer revealed he would no longer represent him, despite the 
possibility that Zimmerman could have faced charges resulting from the dispute
with his wife.

When police arrived on the scene of the argument, Zimmerman was in the driver's seat of his car.

Officers ordered him out of his car and shouted for him to raise his hands, turn around and walk backwards toward them.

By the time he appeared to be about 20 feet away, police shouted 'Get on your knees! Lock your feet!'

Zimmerman dropped to his knees and two officers approached, one with his gun drawn, while the other handcuffed him.

Then several other officers ran toward the house where the dispute allegedly took place. The video was first reported by TMZ.

Mark
O'Mara, who represented Zimmerman when he was acquitted of murder in 
the death of Trayvon Martin, made his shock announcement that he would 
be leaving his client as police continued their investigation into the 
warring couple.

During her initial call to police, 
Shellie Zimmerman told dispatchers her husband had punched her father in
the nose and was threatening them with a gun. But she later changed her
story and decided against pressing charges.

No
gun was ever found and Zimmerman claimed it was his wife who was the 
aggressor. The spat came just days after she filed for divorce, claiming
their marriage was irretrievably broken.

More work: O'Mara speaks with a police officer at the scene, where he was visibly annoyed at his client

On the 911 call following the argument, Shellie claimed Zimmerman had smashed her iPad.

When
asked who could be charged, Hudson said: 'As of right now, it 
could be either one or it could be no one. It depends what that iPad has
on it, what that footage shows.'

Authorities
are also looking into whether surveillance video from cameras at the 
house captured the dispute, and Shellie added on the 911 call
that a city worker witnessed the spat.

Zimmerman's attorney, O'Mara,
said that his client did nothing wrong but added that he was no longer going
to represent Zimmerman due to their impending divorce.

'I've come to know them as a family, and it's not a good idea to get in between them,' O'Mara said.

O'Mara will continue to be Zimmerman's
lawyer in a defamation suit pending against NBC and in the remaining 
motions from the Trayvon Martin trial.

ABC
News reported that O'Mara appeared to struggle with his anger at his 
client during Monday's incident when he arrived at the home.

During a press conference, O'Mara was asked if he had any advice for Zimmerman, and he responded: 'Pay me.'

The September encounter was the latest in a string of events for Zimmerman. He
has twice been pulled over on suspicion of speeding and ticketed once. 
He also appeared in photos at a gun maker that were published online and
he helped members of a family from their vehicle following a car wreck.

Shellie
Zimmerman had collected most of her belongings from the house where she
and her husband had been staying until she moved out.

The day of the incident, she 
returned unexpectedly to gather the remaining items, and emotions got 
out of control, O'Mara said. Neither side pressed charges and no one was arrested.

'I
know the 911 tape suggests that Shellie was saying something but I 
think that was heightened emotions,' O'Mara said.

'There may have been 
some pushing and touching. That happens a lot in divorce situations. ...
Nobody was injured.'
