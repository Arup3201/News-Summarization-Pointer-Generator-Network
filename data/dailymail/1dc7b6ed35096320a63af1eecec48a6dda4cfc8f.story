Former Arsenal winger Gervinho has warned Manchester City that Roma are preparing to end their Champions League hopes this week. 

The Italians host the Premier League champions on Wednesday evening knowing that a goalless draw will be enough to see them progress to the next stage of the competion if CSKA Moscow fail to beat Bayern Munich.

But, Gervinho insists his side will be chasing the win that will guarantee their place in the knockout draw - while adding that Manuel Pellegrini's side are under huge pressure to satisfy their wealthy owners.

Speaking to the Sun on Sunday, the Ivory Coast forward said: 'We must win. If we beat City we go through even if Moscow win.'

'City are obliged to win. They have all the pressure. Not Roma. City are in the same period that Chelsea used to be before they won it. It becomes complex until you win the trophy.

'The trophy their investors expect to win is the Champions League... City have a lot more pressure on us given the expense they have undertaken to create this team. It's the Champions League that they desperately want.'

Sergio Aguero leaves the field in tears after suffering a ligament injury that will also keep him out of the game

Gervinho has developed as a player since his frustrating spell at Arsenal

Roma held the Blues to a 1-1 draw in October but Gervinho suggests they will carry the upper hand in the next game due to the absence of suspended Yaya Toure - not to mention that ligament injury that will keep Sergio Aguero out of the decisive game.

'City are not the same team without Yaya,' he said of his international team-mate.

'For them, it's a loss that he won't be there. He is 90 per cent of their team- he's a very important player for them.

'When he's in top form the whole team does well. When he's not well, City are not well either.'
