Auction website eBay has refused to list a World War II-era Mercedes Benz once owned Hermann Goering, a Nazi leader who commanded the German air force, citing a policy prohibiting the sale of offensive items.

The 1941 Mercedes Benz 540 K Cabriolet B, custom built by Daimler-Benz for Adolf Hitler's close confidant, is currently in pieces in a high-end south Florida automobile shop, where owners said they plan to spend about $750,000 to restore it to working condition.

'We've located all the replacement parts and we can make parts,' said High Velocity Classics co-owner David Rathbun.

Needs work: The 1941 Mercedes Benz 540 K Cabriolet B, custom built by Daimler-Benz for Adolf Hitler's close confidant, is currently in pieces in a high-end south Florida automobile shop, where owners said they plan to spend about $750,000 to restore it to working condition

eBay, however, asked the owners to take down the auction after learning it would go live in early July.

'eBay has policies in place that prohibit the sale of offensive materials and content, which includes listings that promote or glorify hatred, violence or racial, sexual or religious intolerance,' spokesman Ryan Moore wrote in an email.

the car was considered a trophy of allied victory after it was captured at Hitler’s villa at Berchtesgaden at the close of the war.

It was used by Colonel Heintges, the commander of the 7th Infantry who captured the vehicle, as his personal vehicle, which it remained during the Allied Occupation of Germany.

Evil: Hermann Goering founded Hitler's Gestapo secret police and was a prime architect of the Nazi Holocaust

After the war it became army surplus and was eventually sold by the head of a psychology institution in Heilbronn to Master Sergeant Sam Hosier, who drove it in occupied Germany.

Hosier brought it to the United States and in 1955 sold it to a North Carolina man, who owned it until this year.

The owners would not say how much they paid for the car, only that they hope it will sell for $5 million to $7 million.

Another of Goering's cars, a 
convertible Mercedes 540 K nicknamed the Blue Goose, was auctioned in 
2011 in Italy by Ontario, Canada-based RM Auctions for about $2 million.

The owners lamented having to turn to traditional high-end auto sales auctions to sell the stretch coupe once work is finished.

'eBay is all over the world, it has hundreds of millions of users, and it was the biggest venue anyone could find,' Rathbun said.

Hermann Goering amassed a personal fortune from confiscated Jewish property

Hermann Goering founded Hitler's Gestapo secret police and was a prime architect of the Nazi Holocaust.

A
 fighter pilot in the First World War, Goering went on to join Hitler's 
Nationalist Socialist Party and eventually became his deputy in 1939.

Goering was the head of the SA, also 
known as the Brownshirts, and helped Heinrich Himmler set up Germany's 
concentration camps.

In 1938, he became head of Germany's armed forces and when the Second World War broke out the following year, he was put in charge of the Luftwaffe and led the Nazi air force during the Battle of Britain.

Following Hitler's suicide in 1945, Goering surrendered to the U.S. Army in Austria.

He was found guilty of war crimes at the Nuremberg trials and was sentenced to death.

However, he cheated the hangman's noose by killing himself in his cell aged 53 with a phial of hidden cyanide.

He was known as a Nazi 'magpie' and amassed a personal fortune through the confiscation of Jewish property.

His collection included paintings, tapestries, jewellery, hunting ornaments, altarpieces and rugs.
