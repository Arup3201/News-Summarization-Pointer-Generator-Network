She is the Italian supermodel who swaps the catwalk for a cliff and her couture clothing for a wing suit.

Roberta Mancino, who has posed for shoots in magazines such as Maxim, Men's Health and Vanity Fair, moonlights as a daredevil.

The 33-year-old model has completed more than 8,000 sky-dives, is a champion base-jumper and has recently taken an interest in scuba-diving with sharks.

Real passion: The model says walking down the catwalk is her less exciting job and has recently taken an interest in diving with sharks

She claims modelling is her less exciting job and that her passion is not her appearance, but death-defying stunts.

'I like to dress up and wear make-up sometimes', she told Good Morning America, 'but not all the time'.

'I have done about 8,000 skydives and I love to fly my wingsuit. I'm better at jumping off a cliff on high heels.' 

Extreme: She holds three world records in base jumping and appeared as a stuntwoman in Iron Man 3

Stunning: In 2010 she was named the World's Sexiest Female Athlete by the magazine Men's Fitness.

The model is one of the best wingsuit flyers in the world, holding three freestyle world records, and has appeared in the movie Iron Man 3.

Despite her experience, she has had some near-death experience, including three sky dives where her parachute failed to open.

'It happens a lot when you are student and happens later, and it's not a big deal. It gives you a little bit of adrenaline when happens,' she said.

In 2010, she was named the World's Sexiest Female Athlete by the magazine Men's Fitness.
