Ghislaine Maxwell, the woman accused of 'facilitating Prince Andrew's acts of sexual abuse', has been seen in public for the first time since the 'sex slave' scandal broke.

Dressed in a long grey coat and sunglasses, the 53-year-old looked sombre as she left her home in New York City and made her way to a nearby office building.

She stands accused of procuring young girls for the sexual gratification of billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and his ‘friends’.

Sombre: Ms Maxwell, pictured today, was seen in public for the first time since the 'sex slave' scandal broke

Allegations: She is accused of 'facilitating Prince Andrew's acts of sexual abuse by acting as a madame for Epstein'. Above, Ms Maxwell looks on as Prince Andrew smiles with Virginia Roberts in 2001

Claims: Ms Maxwell, pictured left today and right in June 2014, was described in the court papers, filed in a Florida court last week, as a ‘primary co-conspirator in Epstein’s sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme’

Court documents filed by Jane Doe 3 - now known to be Virginia Roberts - say that Ms Maxwell ‘facilitated Prince Andrew’s acts of sexual abuse by acting as a madame for Epstein’.

Ms Maxwell was described in the court papers, filed in a Florida court last week, as a ‘primary co-conspirator in Epstein’s sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme’. 

A spokesperson for Ms Maxwell has reportedly strongly denied the allegations, and she has previously made clear that Epstein's crimes were committed long before she had dealings with him. 

The Duke was meanwhile holed up at his Royal Lodge mansion in Windsor today from where he is believed to have spoken to the Queen by phone to tell her he is innocent of claims levelled against him in a US court. 

The extraordinary allegation made by Miss Roberts is part of a US civil case against Epstein.

She claims Prince Andrew had sex with her when she was 17 – a minor under US law – and employed as a 'sex slave' by Epstein.

The fifth in line to the throne slept with Miss Roberts at an orgy with other under-age girls on Epstein's private Caribbean island, as well as in a private house in London and in Epstein's New York mansion, according to the court papers.

Accusation: Ms Maxwell, pictured, allegedly invited Virginia Roberts to Epstein's mansion to be a masseuse

In a strongly-worded statement, a Buckingham Palace spokesman has said: 'It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. The allegations made are false and without any foundation.' 

Miss Roberts claims she was 15 when she met Ms Maxwell at a Florida spa in 1998. Ms Maxwell allegedly invited her to Epstein's mansion to be a masseuse. 

Miss Roberts claims she was made to perform sex acts on Epstein. 

She also claimed that the first time she met Prince Andrew was at Ms Maxwell's home in London, where she was flown at the request of Epstein.

One picture, said to have been taken by Epstein during Andrew's first encounter with the girl in March 2001 shows the Prince with his arm around her waist as Ms Maxwell looks on.

Describing what happened, Miss Roberts said Epstein invited her to accompany him on a six-week trip in 2001. They flew to Paris, then Spain, then Tangier and finally, they went to London.

'After we landed, we drove straight to Ghislaine's Maxwell's house' and 'was given a small upstairs bedroom,' Virginia said.

She said: 'The following morning, Ghislaine came in. She was chirpy and jumped on the bed saying, 'Get up, sleepyhead. You've got a big day. We've got to go shopping. You need a dress as you're going to dance with a Prince tonight.'

'She said I needed to be 'smiley' and bubbly because he was the Queen's son.

'Ghislaine and I went to Burberry, where she bought me a £5,000 bag, and to a few other designer stores where we bought a couple of dresses, a pair of embroidered jeans and a pink singlet, perfume and make-up,' she said.

'We got back to Ghislaine's house at around 4pm and I ran straight upstairs to shower and dress.

'When I went downstairs, Ghislaine and Jeffrey were in the lounge. There was a knock at the door. Ghislaine led Andrew in and we kissed each other on the cheek.

'Ghislaine served tea from a porcelain pot and biscuits. She knew Sarah Ferguson and they talked fondly about Andrew's daughters.

'Then Ghislaine asked Andrew how old he thought I was and he guessed 17'.

The four of them went out to dinner and on to Tramp nightclub where, she says, Andrew danced with her.

'After about an hour-and-a-half, we drove back to Ghislaine's. All of us went upstairs and I asked Jeffrey to snap a picture of me with the Prince. I wanted something to show my Mom. Ghislaine and Jeffrey left us after that, and later Andrew left'.

Ms Maxwell, the cherished daughter of crooked tycoon Robert Maxwell, is no stranger to scandal. 

Her world came crashing down in 1991 when her father plunged to his death from the deck of his £15million yacht, named Lady Ghislaine in her honour.

Shortly afterwards it was revealed that the notorious newspaper tycoon had stolen £440million from the Mirror Group’s pension fund.

Ms Maxwell and her family were disgraced, and she fled to New York to escape the furore in Britain.

It was in America that she met Epstein, becoming his girlfriend for a time and attending celebrity events with him. 

He provided her with a champagne lifestyle of luxurious holidays and palatial apartments that she could never have afforded on the £80,000-a-year her father left her.

In return, she used her contacts to introduce Epstein to leading lights of the world of showbusiness, politics and royalty, including Prince Andrew.

But in recent years she has also faced accusations that she procured girls for Epstein – claims she has always denied.

Ms Maxwell, now 53, was educated at Marlborough College and Oxford University.

In 2000 she and Epstein were seen on holiday with Prince Andrew at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida. That same year, she took the prince to a ‘hookers and pimps’ themed party in New York, which was hosted by the former lingerie model Heidi Klum.

There were once rumours that Ms Maxwell would marry Epstein, but their relationship reportedly ended because he wanted to see other women.

However, it is alleged that the services provided by Ms Maxwell to the wealthy financier extended to finding attractive girls for him and his friends.
