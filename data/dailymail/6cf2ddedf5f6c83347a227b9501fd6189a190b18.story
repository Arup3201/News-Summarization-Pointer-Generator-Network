A devastated couple have spoken of their grief at waking up on Mother's Day to discover their teenage daughter had died in a car crash.  

Emily Morfitt was driving in the early hours of Sunday morning when her car left the road outside Beverley in East Yorkshire, killing her.  

Her parents described waking up on Mothering Sunday and being told 'our precious angel had been taken from us'.

Emily, who worked in a cafe, died less than two weeks after her 19th birthday.  

She was driving her blue Ford Ka around 4am when she came off the road near a business park, coming to rest in a field, and was pronounced dead at the scene. 

The teenager's father John paid tribute to his daughter on behalf of his wife Joanne and the rest of the family.  

'Emily had turned 19 just nine days before this tragic accident,' Mr Morfitt said. 'She left school early with three A-levels and started work in Brown's department store in Beverley. Her dream however was to become a professional tattooist.  

'On Saturday we went to sleep as a complete, loving family. We woke on Mothering Sunday to find that our precious angel had been taken from us.

'No words can describe our loss. We have lost one of life's good people. A truly kind human being who had everything to live for who had that rare ability to make people smile and who never held grudges.  

'As a family we can only thank her for 19 fantastic years together. As I write this tears are streaming down my face. She did not deserve this.  

'RIP Emily, the world has lost a fantastic person but heaven has a new bright shining star.'  

Emily had two siblings, 15-year-old sister Abi and brother Tommy, 13, and was in a relationship with Zak Davies.

Friends left cards and flowers at the scene of the accident - one wrote: 'A happy, beautiful young woman - how can this be? We will love and remember you always.'  

Louise Grant, the manager of Brown's, said: 'We are absolutely devastated following the loss of Emily.  

'We cannot even begin to imagine what her family are going through. We are a very close knit-team here and we feel like we have lost a member of our own family.  

'A big part of our candle went out on Sunday following the loss of our dear friend. She will be sadly missed by everyone.'  

Humberside Police are appealing for witnesses to contact them with information.
