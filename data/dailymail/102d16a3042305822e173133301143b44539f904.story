Officials working at London Underground were forced to apologise after a quote from alleged rapist Bill Cosby was posted at a tube station. 

Cosby has been accused of sexually abusing 14 women and raping at least three - one more than 40 years ago.

A board placed at Tooting Bec tube station in south London, which staff use to post a 'thought of the day' to cheer up commuters, featured a quote from Cosby.

Tube officials were forced to apologise for using a quote from alleged rapist Bill Cosby for their 'thought of the day' at Tooting Bec underground. The board is used to cheer up commuters but caused offence

The whiteboard said: '''A word to the wise is not necessary. It's the stupid ones that need advice" - Bill Cosby.'

It was placed in such a position that everybody exiting through the barriers at the busy Northern Line Tube station, in south west London, saw it on Monday.

George Taylor, 28, a commuter, said: 'It's wholly inappropriate.

'Bill Cosby hasn't been relevant for years, and all of a sudden, when the focus is on him over monstrous sex allegations, some clever-clogs decides to quote him.'

Transport for London has apologised for the 'misjudged' quote.

Pat Hansberry, London Underground's General Manager for the Northern line, said: ''We acknowledge that the 'thought of the day' quote at Tooting Bec station was misjudged.

'I apologise to any customers who were offended and I will ask our staff to be more careful in future.'

Bill Cosby has been accused of sexually abusing 13 women in the past but his lawyer said he would not dignify historic discredited claims with a response

Cosby has faced historical allegations of sexual abuse. 

In November 2006 he settled a civil lawsuit with Andrea Constand, a former Temple University employee who claimed he had drugged and sexually assaulted her in his mansion two years earlier.

Her lawyers said they had the names of 13 other women who had come forward voluntarily with similar accounts of drugging or abuse at the hands of Cosby. 

But the settlement was reached before the women gave evidence.

Last month Barbara Bowman said she was one of these women and alleged she had been drugged and raped by Cosby in 1985 when she was 17-years-old. Joan Tarshis has also claimed she was drugged and raped by the TV actor in 1969 when she was an aspiring 19-year-old actress in Hollywood.

When asked about the latest allegations by Ms Tarshis the comedian's lawyer said he will not 'dignify' allegations with a response and has said some of the claims have been discredited. Cosby has never been criminally charged in any of the cases.

During an interview at the weekend Cosby remained silent when asked about the allegations.
