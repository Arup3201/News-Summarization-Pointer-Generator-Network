An American prog-rock star who has sold millions of records is at the centre of an online storm after a London ambulance did not have enough fuel to take him to hospital.

Mike Portnoy, 47, a drummer with the iconic prog-rock outfit Dream Theater, said that he was barely able to stand or lift his arms shortly before he was due to go on stage at the Islington Assembly Hall in London on Saturday night.

Paramedics attended the scene and said that the star needed to be taken to hospital so that his mystery illness could be treated. However, they admitted that they didn't have enough petrol to get him there.

Downbeat: American rock star Mike Portnoy, 47, was struck down by a mystery illness before a gig in London, but was left stranded after the ambulance taking him to hospital ran out of petrol. He was eventually given a lift by a fan, but when he arrived at A&E, doctors forced him to wait because his condition was not life-threatening

Portnoy claims that ambulance staff said that he should find alternative transport, although the London Ambulance Service denies this.

The drummer asked fans waiting for him to perform with rock band Neal Morse if they would drive him to the nearby Whittington Hospital.

Once a volunteer was found, Portnoy was driven to Accident and Emergency.

A London Ambulance spokesman said: 'An ambulance crew arrived at an address on Upper Street in Islington to take a patient to the Urgent Care Centre at the Whittington hospital,.

'The vehicle was low on fuel and requested another ambulance to take the patient to hospital. The patient decided to make their own way to hospital so the second ambulance was not sent.' 

When asked if the paramedics would have been allowed to fill up at the petrol station located next door to the venue, a spokesman said that he 'wasn't sure', but confirmed that the crew 'had been on the road since 6.30am and it was their last job'.

Angry: Mike Portnoy, 47, an American rock star, spoke out against the Whittington hospital in London in an extended Facebook rant

But the litany of bad luck did not end there. 

According to fellow band member Neal Morse, after whom the group is named, 'it took us 30 minutes because of traffic that the ambulance probably could've avoided'.

To make matters worse, when Portnoy arrived at Whittington hospital, staff told him that he would have to wait to allow them to deal with more urgent, life-threatening cases.

At this point, Portnoy appeared to lose his temper. 

'A very special NO THANKS to the staff at the Whittington Hospital for NOT seeing me regardless of telling them that there is an audience waiting for our show to begin,' he wrote on Facebook.

'I finally left WITHOUT seeing a doctor in order to make tonight's show. I have no idea how the hell I'm going to make it through this show. I can't even stand up or lift my arms.'

His online rant generated thousands of responses, as fans and members of the public accused him of being a 'diva' and trying to exploit his fame to go to the front of the queue.

One fan wrote: 'Not to be rude, but if someone was dying, I'd hope they didn't move you to the front of the line just to get you to a show. Very narcissistic thinking here.'

Another fan, who said he was a doctor at the Whittington, wrote: 'As much as I'd jump at the opportunity to help you if I actually was on call tonight, please try to understand.

'Us healthcare professionals don't want anyone to wait or suffer at all.

'However, we encounter life-threatening conditions every hour, sometimes every minute, that stop us from seeing others that may be slightly less unwell, as quickly as we'd like. 

'Waiting sucks, I know, but dying patients suck even more.'

The intensity of the row provoked Portnoy's wife, Marlene Portnoy, 51, to leap to his defence.

'Some of you people are just so horrible,' she said. 'He didn't ask for special treatment because he was famous, his concern was the fans that paid good money to see a concert that was about to get cancelled.'

Portnoy later apologised to staff at the Whittington.

End of the road: An ambulance is parked outside the Whittington hospital, London. An American rock star, Mike Portnoy, 47, has complained that when he fell ill in London, a paramedic team was unable to transfer him to hospital because their ambulance had run out of petrol

'It was not a personal attack or rage against England's health care system in general, of which I know nothing about,' he said.

'I did not expect any special treatment or wanted to be put ahead of anybody else in need. We only wanted some answers as the clock was ticking until showtime.' 

On Facebook, Portnoy said that the episode was 'one of the worst days of my life'.

Whittington Hospital declined to comment.
