A hilarious new video has emerged of a pet cat attempting to play a game of ‘cat-and-mouse’ with a car’s windshield wiper.

The cat – a gray and white Maine Coon – is called Mei and is enjoying pride of place sitting on the dashboard of the car when it starts to rain.

The driver turns on the windshield wipers which gently starts to move back and forth.

Spying the sudden movement, the cat jumps into hunter mode and makes repeated attempts to try and catch the wiper with her claws.

In between her sudden movements, the cat also tries to act like a cool customer and does some essential grooming, but she can’t resist another attempt to catch the wiper – seemingly unaware that it is actually on the other side of the glass.

According to a comment posted with the video on MostWatchedToday.com, the cat is called Mei and she enjoys nothing better than ‘playing with anything that moves.’

She certainly displays her lightening quick reflexes in the video as she repeatedly follows the wiper all the way across the window while managing to expertly retain her balance.

Maine Coons, also known as American Longhairs, are a breed of domestic cat with a distinctive physical appearance and valuable hunting skills. The breed is one of the oldest natural to North America, specifically native to the state of Maine, where it is the official state cat.

One of the most popular cat breeds in the world, Maine Coon's are known for their intelligence, gentle personality and always keeping their owner amused.

Mei is certainly one cool customer, but the least said about that dodgy bell and red handkerchief ensemble the owner has put her in the better.
