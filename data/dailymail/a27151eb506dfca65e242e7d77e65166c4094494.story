Staying healthy has become a national obsession – certainly if our reading habits are anything to go by.

Last year, Britons spent a staggering £47.4 million on health-related books in a bid to shed our muffin tops, relieve what ails us, and render us less stressed. 

While nearly every other area of publishing shrinks, this is one sector still doing roaring business.

Read yourself healthy: CAROLINE SANDERSON, associate editor at The Bookseller, (not pictured) reviews her top-five health books 2014

Sales this year are expected to continue to grow. Perhaps wearying of unrealistic fitness regimes, we are disciplining ourselves instead with The Fast Diet and The 5:2 Diet (two of the biggest sellers for a second year running), increasingly going sour on sugar, as recommended by the World Health Organisation, and juicing every last nutrient out of everything from blueberries to Brussels sprouts.

As an associate editor at The Bookseller, I get an early peek at some truly useful, life-enhancing books which don’t necessarily subscribe to the latest craze. These are five of my best from 2014...

Later! A Guide to Parenting a Young Adult by Gill Hines and Alison Baverstock 

(Piatkus, £14.99)

There are dozens of books on bringing up a baby or training your toddler, but almost nothing on young adults. With my firstborn fast approaching 17, I was delighted to see this one. 

Amid helpful case histories and thought-provoking exercises, there is a great deal of sensible advice on such contentious topics as career paths, first love and the Hotel of Mum and Dad. It gently reassured me too that my lovely son is not the recluse I was worried he might be.

Helpful tomes: Later! A Guide to Parenting a Young Adult and We Need to Talk About Grief : How to Be a Friend to the One Who’s Left Behind

We Need to Talk About Grief : How to Be a Friend to the One Who’s Left Behind by Annie Broadbent 

(Piatkus, £12.99)

After my father died of cancer last December, I’ve been thinking a lot about what has helped. Thousands of people find themselves in the same situation, yet I have found few books that truly articulate the kind of feelings which rise up. Then I fell upon the compassionate approach of someone who lost her mother to cancer. Annie combines candid first-person stories of bereavement with sensible and sensitive advice underno-nonsense headings. She also makes a heartfelt plea for thosewho would rather cross the road than speak to a bereaved friend toget to grips with death, which is something I feel needs to be said.

The Mount Athos Diet by Richard Storey, Sue Todd and Lottie Storey 

(Vermilion, £10.99)

I am suspicious of diets which claim to be both effective and delicious, but the recipes in The Mount Athos Diet, based on a typical Mediterranean peasant diet (vegetables, pulses, fruit, nuts,wholegrains and olive oil) have enticed me to try them from next month. The method involves fasting for three days, eating moderately for three and feasting on the seventh. The monks of Mount Athos are among the healthiest people in the world.

Food and beauty: The Mount Athos Diet and French Women Don’t Get Facelifts

Don't forget: Where Memories Go: Why Dementia Changes Everything

French Women Don’t Get Facelifts by Mireille Guiliano

(Doubleday, £14.99)

The trendy idea that nobody does it better than the French is a galling one.

 But in this book Mireille Guiliano, who takes her mantra from Coco Chanel (‘no one is young over 40, but one can be irresistible at any age’),shares her knowledge on ageing with a style and attitude that is indeed hard to resist.

She covers everything from hair and shoes (the two biggest ‘tells’, apparently) to proper breathing, and the benefits of going to bed an hour earlier twice a week when you’re aged over 50. And Botox? Just say non!

Where Memories Go: Why Dementia Changes Everything by Sally Magnusson 

(Two Roads, £16.99)

Sadly, dementia has been a dominant theme among the bestselling books on illness this year. 

Sally Magnusson’s is a personal and humane approach to the distress and challenges of the condition,but also a call for us to reconsider how we look after society’s most fragile. 

I’m also pressing everyone to read Being Mortal: Illness, Medicine And What Matters In The End by Atul Gawande.
