Naomi Campbell is without a doubt one of the fashion industry's most famous faces.

Scouted at the tender age of 15, Naomi is still one of the world's most in-demand models despite working in the industry for nearly 30 years; it's no she's dubbed a 'super'.

Despite her unprecedented success - she's worked for every major fashion house -  Naomi, 44, admits that even she gets nervous before a catwalk appearance.

Still a super: Naomi Campbell may have broken into the industry nearly thirty years ago but at 44, she's better than ever - and proves it in this glossy shoot for The Edit

Speaking to Net-a-Porter's The Edit, she said: 'I still get scared. I cross myself before I go onto the runway. I pray my dress isn’t going to fall off.' 

Her biggest fear, she says, is fear itself. 'If you feel fear, fear will come to you. Fear is a terrible thing to have and I’ve been aware of that since I was a kid. It can stop you doing things in your life. I don’t want fear to get hold of me.'

Helping hand: The supermodel, who grew up in the fast-paced world of fashion, was offered valuable advice from Nelson Mandela

Survivor: She says that as a Gemini, she likes to keep moving and doing things and being there for friends no matter how hectic her life may get

Luckily for Naomi, she's been able to share the experience with her 'fashion family' - a starry host of models, designers and photographers, who have helped nurture her along the way. 

'I definitely spent more time around them than around my own blood family as I was traveling and working so much… Azzedine [Alaïa] is more like a papa; Gianni [Versace] was more like a brother,' she said.

As one of the 90’s supers, which also included Cindy Crawford, Kate Moss, Linda Evangelista and Christy Turlington, Campbell’s life has rocked and rolled between extremes but she is, above all, a survivor.

Internationally renowned: Along with Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell is without a doubt one of the fashion industry's most famous faces and at 44, she's still going strong

'I don’t have to justify myself to anyone. I took off almost five years from work,' she said. 'But I’m a Gemini and I like to keep moving and doing things and being there for friends. If I go against my instincts, there is always a consequence.'

And one special man has helped her along the way - and now she wants to help others. '[Nelson] Mandela always said to me: "Use yourself to help other people." 

'I feel that now more strongly than ever before and I try to do that in the best way I can,' she said. 

She is certainly doing just that - she's raised millions for causes including Hurricane Katrina and the Haiti earthquake. 

In response to the current Ebola threat, she has launched the #CrushEbolaNow campaign with other celebrities, which aims to educate and raise funds to help fight the spread of the deadly virus. 

Giving back: The supermodel says that she tries to do all she can to help others and has launched many charity appeals over the years
