This is the terrifying moment a motorcyclist veers across a winding country lane and ploughs head-on into a lorry.

The biker is seen failing to take a bend properly and drifting into the opposite carriageway as the HGV approaches.

The man's motorbike was torn in half by the impact - but miraculously the rider escaped with just a broken shoulder.

Footage filmed by a lorry's cabin camera shows the bike skid into the path of the truck near Rye, East Sussex

The bike was ripped in half in the incident but the motorcyclist escaped with only a broken shoulder

Police investigated the accident to see if the lorry driver was speeding but decided nobody was to blame

Police launched an investigation amid suspicions the lorry driver could have been guilty of speeding, dangerous driving or poor lane discipline.

But the footage, filmed with a  SmartWitness Vehicle Accident Camera mounted on the dashboard of the truck, proved that the driver was not to blame for the 30mph smash in Rye, East Sussex.

Mark Chamberlain, managing director of John Jempson & Son who own the lorry, said: 'The driver was travelling safely and within the speed limit on the country lanes near where we are based.

'You can see on the video that he is passed first by a motorcyclist, who turned out to be the female partner of the injured rider.

'The second rider follows very closely behind her. If you slow the video right down you can see that he hits a pothole and veers over the road into the path of our truck after coming out of a corner.

'There is a collision but thankfully the motorcyclist is lucky and he escapes with a broken shoulder.'

The footage shows the moment the biker hits the pothole in the middle of the road as he rounds a country bend

Initially following another bike, the rider then loses control and slides across road into the path of the truck

The bike then ploughs into the front of the lorry and a cloud of smoke rises as it is ripped to shreds

The owner of the lorry says he is pleased he was using the camera, which showed his driver was not to blame

Mr Chamberlain added: 'He is already coming off the bike at the point of impact and he ends up falling to the side of our truck.

'Our driver is understandably badly shaken by what has happened and is immediately given a week off work to recover.

'The police quite properly investigate the incident and the first thing they want to see is the footage from Smart Witness.

'This shows quite clearly that our driver is blameless and there is no case to answer.'

Manufacturers say the devices, which start at £149, 'pay for themselves' through reduced insurance premiums.
