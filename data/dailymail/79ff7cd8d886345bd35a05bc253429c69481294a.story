They have been married for 45 years but still Malcolm Cowen struggles to recognise his own wife in a crowded room.

The 67-year-old was born with the rare condition prosopagnosia or 'face-blindness', which means he is unable to recognise faces.

The computer-programmer from Manchester has spent his life developing various strategies to help him handle social situations.

Mr Cowen, who cannot pick out his own face in the mirror and likens his condition to dyslexia, said he has learned the clothes his wife wears and picks out his grandchildren, according to their ages.

'I can’t recognise my own face in the mirror, I can’t recognise faces in pictures and I can’t recognise even my own wife’s face,' he said.

'All I know is a face is a thing at the top of the body.

'Most people can see individual people in that thing called a face - but I simply cannot.

'If a normal person is shown two photographs and asked if they are the same individual, most people would instantly say yes or no.

'But I have to start scanning to match an ear with an ear or a nose with a nose and make a guess from each of these features.

'Most people can also spot someone when shown a front picture of the face and a profile – however when I’m shown a picture from the front and profile I can’t match the features so I’m totally lost.

'The easiest way for me to explain the condition to people is to describe it as like having dyslexia for faces. 

'In a similar way to how a dyslexic-person has problems seeing words made up of letters I have problems seeing a face which is made-up of features.'

Mr Cowen has spent his life developing various strategies to help him handle social situations, and can only spot his wife of 45 years by recognising her clothes and hairstyle

Face-blindness is often caused by a stroke or injury to the brain – however in rare cases such as Mr Cowen's it can be inherited.

As well as failing to spot members of this family in the street, Mr Cowen also struggles to follow the plot of television shows, failing to spot characters.

Even famous faces in magazines and newspapers leave the 67-year-old baffled.

The condition is so rare that it was little-understood until recently. 

It is thought to be caused by a problem with the part of the brain called the fusiform gyrus, which is responsible for face recognition.

Despite his condition, Mr Cowen studied maths at Nottingham University and went on to write software for computers.

It was there he met the woman he would marry, fellow Nottingham University student, Beryl.

'When I first met Malcolm’s family I was the one who had to explain to him who everyone was,' the 66-year-old said.

'I had to introduce myself and then get their names from them so he knew who was who.             

'The funny thing was Malcolm’s family was large with lots of uncles, cousins and in-laws so it was confusing for him.

'I knew then that there was something very special about Malcolm.'

With the help of his wife, who acts as his minder at parties, community meetings and family gatherings – Mr Cowen has raised three sons and six grandchildren.

'Even after 45-years of marriage Malcolm can only recognise me by my hair, my clothes and as he puts it – by the way I move,' she said.

'So for the past 40-years I’ve had to keep my old short-perm hair-do and same style clothes, which does feel like being in a bit of a fashion time-warp.

'Once, Malcolm was being presented with an award in London for his work, so I treated myself to a new hair-do.

'Of course when I arrived outside the venue, Malcolm walked straight past me like I wasn’t here.

'But he’s always joking that he doesn’t have strange women showing up at the door too often, so he’s not likely to let anyone in he’s not supposed to.'

Mr Cowen said he is lucky his grandchildren - Jemma, 17, Shinea, 16, Beverly, 13, Dylan, four, Merissa three, and Erin, one - all are either different ages or have different colour hair, allowing him to guess who they are.

Prosopagnosia is a neurological disorder characterised by the inability to recognise people's faces.  

Also known as 'face-blindness', the severity of the condition depends on the degree of impairment a person suffers.

Some people with prosopagnosia may only struggle to recognise a familiar face, while others will be unable to discriminate between unknown faces, and in more severe cases sufferers cannot distinguish a face as being different from an object.

As in Mr Cowen's case, some sufferers are unable to recognise their own faces.

The condition is not related to memory loss, impaired vision or learning disabilities.

It is thought to be the result of abnormalities, damage, or impairment in the right fusiform gyrus - a fold in the brain that appears to coordinate facial perception and memory.

Prosopagnosia can result from stroke, traumatic brain injury, or some neurodegenerative diseases.

In some cases the condition is congenital, and present at birth.

It appears to run in families, which makes it likely to be the result of a genetic mutation or deletion.

Some degree of prosopagnosia is often found in children with autism and Asperger's Syndrome.

Treatment of the condition focuses on helping sufferers develop compensatory strategies, including relying on voice recognition, clothing, or unique physical attributes.

However, when they are around other children it becomes confusing, he added.

'There was a funny moment when my eldest grand-daughter Jemma decided to play a prank on me,' said Mr Cowen.

'She has red hair but there were other children with red hair also. Her friends saw that I couldn’t tell whether or not it was her.

'Then she turned round and grinned at me, and I knew it was her. This was her little joke to prove to her friends that I do have a condition.

'At children’s parties where lots of kids are around I tend to play with them all. I just have to do my best to keep track of my own grandchildren.'

As well as haircuts, distinctive features, footwear, speech and movement, Mr Cowen uses other tricks to lead a normal life.

'I use clothes and shoes to tell people apart,' he said.

'Women can be easier than men, but they do have the annoying habit of wearing different clothes each day, which means I do lose track of them.'

For most of his life, Mr Cowen did not realise face blindness existed, so it was impossible for him to explain why he could not recognise people he had already met.

But since his diagnosis by the Manchester Royal Infirmary, he finds by being up-front and open about his face-blindness that he can finally enjoy a relaxed social-life.

'I am active in meetings with the council as well as in the community through amateur dramatics and in my local church,' he said.

'At meetings where I know people is fine, but I’ll draw a diagram of where everyone is sitting.

'Now I tell people about my face-blindness up-front so they introduce themselves when they see me.

'Most people understand if it’s explained to them properly.

'And I have Beryl with me usually. She does a wonderful job of saying people’s names aloud while we are meeting them.

'Now I treat my face-blindness as a thing to laugh about not a something to get het up about.

'This means no-one need gets embarrassed, especially not me.'
