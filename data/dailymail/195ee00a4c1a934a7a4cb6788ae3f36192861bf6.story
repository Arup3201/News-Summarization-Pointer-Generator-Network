Health minister Jane Ellison said anyone challenged to the extreme drinking game needs support to avoid giving in to peer pressure

Young people risk being bullied online if they ‘chicken out’ of a NekNomination drinking dare, the government has warned.

Health minister Jane Ellison said anyone challenged to the extreme drinking game needs support to avoid giving in to peer pressure.

After three deaths were linked to the internet craze which sees people dare each other to drink dangerous levels of booze, she said the government was advising against any involvement in the ‘potentially dangerous situation’.

Latest figures show that in 2012 a total of 12 people in the twenties died from accidental alcohol poisoning.

But the figure is expected to rise after the NekNominations craze took hold in Britain.

Already this year three deaths have been linked to NekNominations. Bradley Eames, 20, apparently became the third British victim of the deadly crazy after filming himself downing nearly two pints of gin.

The salesman, from Nottingham, was found dead in his home four days after filming the stunt. Police are understood to have watched the video as they investigate the tragedy.

It followed the deaths of Stephen Brookes, 29, and Isaac Richardson, 20, died after completing similar NekNomination challenges.

Miss Ellison said: ‘Reports of the popularity of the drinking game neknomination are a matter of concern.

‘The game's encouragement of participants to outdo each other with ever more reckless stunts brings with it significant risks of alcohol-related harm including acute intoxication, alcohol poisoning, accidents and injury.’

However the public health minister admitted that many young people could feel under pressure to take part once they are challenged.

‘There is the potential for cyber bullying of those who are seen to “chicken out”.

‘It has already cost lives and we would advise anyone against taking part in the game to avoid putting themselves in a potentially dangerous situation,’ she said in a written parliamentary answer.

Public Health England has also issued advice through the FRANK drug information website aimed at young people.

It warns: ‘Alcohol can reduce your inhibitions so you feel more confident but sometimes the situation can get out of hand.

‘Drinking sounds like fun but there is a dark side that we don't often talk about. The problem is that drinking too much alcohol on a single occasion can lead to alcohol poisoning which could put you in a coma or even kill you.’

NekNominate challenge

The NekNominate craze is thought to have originated in Perth, Australia, but thanks to social media it has since gone global.

The hashtag 'neknominate' started trending in the UK in January 2013 and has since been growing in popularity around the world.

The
 concept of the game has been described by a user on Facebook as: 'Neck 
your drink. Nominate another. Don't break the chain, don't be a d**k. 
The social drinking game for social media! #neknominate. Drink 
Responsible'.

The stunt is filmed then posted on the internet.

One
 popular video shows a bare-chested man emptying a bottle of beer down 
the toilet before two friends lower him head-first into the porcelain 
bowl to lap it up.

Another extreme example featured a woman riding a horse into a supermarket and  downing a can of Pepsi.

However,
 the trend has taken a dark trend in recent weeks as reports have begun 
to emerge of young men dying after drinking huge amounts of alcohol for a
 dare.

It added that if someone was nominated it ‘is a tricky one’.

‘You don’t want to look stupid in front of your friends but on the other you may carry out a dare that you later regret.

‘And remember what you post online can stay around for a long time and your future boss might not find it particular funny.’

Figures from the Office for National Statistics reveal that in 2012 a total of 8,367 deaths were linked to alcohol.

Of these 396 were the result of accidental alcohol poisoning – the fourth highest cause of drink-related deaths.

The ONS said: ‘Excessive alcohol consumption in a short period of time can have short term fatal consequences.

‘In fact, accidental alcohol poisoning (intoxication) was the fourth highest (396 deaths) alcohol-related cause of death in 2012, with over a third among those in their 40s.’

However NekNomination videos going viral online is expected to lead to an increase in 2014.

The ONS added: ‘There has been speculation that the influence of social media drinking games may drive these figures up in the future particularly among younger people.

‘In 2012, there were 14 deaths among those in their 20s due to accidental alcohol poisoning, although it is not known whether these deaths were as a result of such games and any deaths occurring recently will not be included in these figures.’

Unlike other forms of alcohol-related death, which are caused by sustained consumption levels over a long period, drinking games can pose an immediate risk to life.

‘The effects of alcohol are almost immediate because it is absorbed faster than it is processed and eliminated from the body,’ the ONS said.

‘People may become very drowsy when intoxicated, they may breathe in their vomit, contract pneumonia or even die. Heavy drinking is also linked with low blood pressure, low blood sugar levels and heart attacks.’
