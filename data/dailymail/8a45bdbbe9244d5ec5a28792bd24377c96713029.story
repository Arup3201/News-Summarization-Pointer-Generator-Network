A woman who attacked a hamster and left it for dead in front of horrified children was ordered to carry out 160 hours of unpaid work.

Tracey McGregor was told by a sheriff she had caused the rodent 'clear distress' and upset the children, who saw Jeff the hamster lying lifeless on the ground.

Sheriff Robert McCreadie told McGregor, 28, at Perth Sheriff Court she was lucky not to have killed the hamster after she hurled its cage more than 20ft through the air.

Tracey McGregor, who hurled a caged hamster down a flight of stairs during an angry row, was found guilty of animal cruelty

He told her: 'The distress to the animal must have been considerable.

'Your behaviour distressed others in the house. There was distress caused to children who ran out of the house past the hamster… they were really upset.'

The sheriff told the court: 'It is clear she was under the influence of alcohol. She has had a difficult relationship with binge-drinking in the past.

'She is noted as posing a high risk of future offending, doesn't show any remorse and continues to deny the hamster was in the cage when the evidence points to the contrary.'

Sheriff McCreadie told McGregor, who was found guilty after a trial of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal in a house in Perth in October 2010, she would be ordered to do the unpaid work as part of a community payback order.

The court was told children fled in fear after McGregor attacked hamsters in the house. Jeff initially appeared to have been killed after his cage smashed open at the foot of the stairs in the home of McGregor's 17-year-old half-sister Leanne Anderson.

Miss Anderson said McGregor had been drunk and had been asked to go after shouting and swearing abuse.

She said McGregor had reacted to this request by grabbing the cage containing Jeff and hurling it down a flight of stairs. She then knocked over two further hamsters in their cages, Miss Anderson said.

She added: 'I asked her to leave when the argument started. She got angry. I had to phone my dad. She shouted down the phone at him. She threw the phone against the wall. I kept asking her to leave. She went into my room and threw some things about.

'That's when she picked up the hamster cage. It was obvious she was heading to the stairs.'

Miss Anderson said her boyfriend tried in vain to stop McGregor, adding: 'I went to check on my younger sister and heard the other two cages getting knocked from the chest of drawers.

'I went back out to see what had happened. She had thrown it down the stairs. It was at the bottom. I saw her at the top of the stairs.'

Miss Anderson said the cage had smashed open on the floor and the hamster was lying motionless on the carpet.

She said the children had been 'really upset, because the hamster was lying at the bottom of the stairs. They were petrified.'

Miss Anderson confirmed Jeff was later taken to the vet and had survived his ordeal.

McGregor, of Perth, admitted she had picked up a cage and had hurled it down the stairs, but claimed it did not contain a hamster at the time.

She said: 'I was being reckless and stupid.' She said she did not like hamsters, adding: 'I am terrified of them.'
