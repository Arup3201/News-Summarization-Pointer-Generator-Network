Mary Berry has revealed her unlikely game face by jumping for joy and performing cartwheels in mock celebration of England’s potential World Cup glory.

The 79-year-old presenter shows off unbelievable tekkers in the promotional video for the new series of BBC One’s The Great British Bake Off, which returns to screens later this summer.

In the video, the food critic is sat around a table with presenters Mel and Sue and celebrity baker Paul Hollywood watching running commentary of an England match.

The star can be heard shouting ‘Come on England’ at the television screen before leaping into the air and screaming for joy when England supposedly score.

She then flees to the outside grounds of The Great British Bake Off headquarters and performs a number of cartwheels – as her horrified co-stars look on.

In a nod to Peter Crouch’s famous ‘robot’ celebration she also busts some moves before throwing herself onto her knees and celebrating as if she had just scored the World Cup winner.

Mel and Sue, joined by Paul Hollywood, look startled as they sip cups of tea while joking that she’s ‘been on the Battenberg again’.

The 40-second video, being aired on BBC, promotes the new series of The Great British Bake Off.
