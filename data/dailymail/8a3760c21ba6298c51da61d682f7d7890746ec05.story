In the world of cars it is – usually – the last word in understated elegance and class.

But this Rolls-Royce Phantom, with its brash red and chrome paint job, seems rather to have missed the point.

The garish car, which sports an Arabic number plate, was spotted last night in Kensington, west London – a traditional night-time haunt of the rich and famous.

Not one for traditionalists: This bright red Rolls-Royce Phantom was spotted in upmarket Kensington, but the cars normally appear in reserved shades of black, silver, cream or deep blue

The car, which was parked up for the evening, featured blacked-out windows which made it impossible to make out any of the traditionally luxurious interior.

Each car is built to the buyer’s specification, so its owner would have been able to request the garish paint job from the beginning.

The Phantom is a classic choice of car for the very wealthy, and they are all assembled by hand at the Rolls-Royce factory in Goodwood, West Sussex.

A-list celebrities David Beckham, Simon Cowell, Jennifer Lopez, Sylvester Stallone and Eddie Murphy have all been spotted riding in the car.

It is also a favourite of the royal family and heads of state worldwide – an earlier version of the Phantom was presented to the Queen as a gift on her Silver Jubilee.

However, the cars almost always appear in reserved shades of black, silver, cream or deep blue.

In marketing literature for the cars, Rolls-Royce invites potential buyers to: ‘discover the genuine authority and rare sense of scale and occasion’ the car offers. They cost around £250,000.

But this over-the-top specimen is hardly an isolated site in London, increasingly the destination of choice for the monied Middle-Eastern elite looking for somewhere cooler than home.

This summer an especially flashy menagerie of vehicles were seen on the streets of the capital – many parked illegally.

The Metropolitan Police seized a £350,000 ‘glow-in-the-dark’ Lamborghini Aventador after its driver – believed to be a Qatari royal – was caught driving uninsured and without a licence.

It was later displayed outside Scotland Yard, covered with police tape reading 'uninsured vehicle seized by police'.

At the time a police spokesman said: 'We have had a few Porsches, BMW X5s, and a Ferrari – that one got crushed and in fact the vast majority of them are.'

Police are known to have seized dozens of super cars across the capital over the last year on an array of charges including driving with invalid insurance and driving without proper registration plates.

Last month, a £300,000 Lamborghini Aventador was pictured being towed away after the driver fell foul of the law - he was found to be driving without correct insurance.

And a member of Qatar's Al-Thani dynasty has had two supercars towed away by police.

The influx of foreign registered super cars to the UK was highlighted in a Channel 4 documentary earlier this year.

Import: This Ferrari is spotted parked up in a wealthy part of London

Viewers saw residents of the upmarket
Knightsbridge area of London - home to Harrods - complain that their 
lives were being made a misery by super rich Arab playboy racers 
speeding around residential streets.

One resident described those with some of the more garish vehicles as 'a manifestation of too muchness'.

The
capital's most affluent areas are often awash with super cars during 
the summer months, with the wealthy Arab elite escaping the searing heat
of their own countries and embarking on a six week tour of Europe's top
cities, including London.

Many of them bring their cars with them during the tour, known as The Season.

Last
summer, five rare vehicles thought to be worth around £5million were 
spotted parked outside the Dorchester Hotel in Mayfair.

It is believed that the cars all belonged to one Saudi businessman.

The
fleet of incredible cars included two £1.5million Bugatti Veyrons, a 
£1million Koenigsegg Agera, a Rolls-Royce Phantom and a mat black 
Lamborghini Aventador.

Costly: A £1 million Qatari registered Pagani Huayra and an orange Lamborghini

Speedster: A £1 million Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport

A 
Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe in pink and an all yellow Ferrari S99
registered in Saudi have also been spotted cruising the capital's 
streets.

Perhaps one of the
most garish cars spotted in London this year was a Ferrari 599, parked 
outside a designer store in Sloane Square.

The
car is impressive enough - reaching top speeds of 205mph and 0 to 60mph
in 3.7 seconds - but this one was wrapped in black velvet.
