Attack: Anthony Teagle, 38, lured Anthony Morris to his home in Bristol, Avon, using his wife's phone and battered him on the doorstep

A jealous husband battered a PCSO who was having an affair with his wife after luring him to their home with messages he sent from her mobile, a court heard.

Anthony Teagle, 38, sent two texts to PCSO Anthony Morris urging him to come to her home in Bristol, Avon.

Teagle flew into a rage when Morris 
replied with sexually explicit texts - detailing what he wanted to do 
with Vanessa Phelps - and he attacked the officer as he arrived at the marital home
in Bristol.

The defendant had initially contacted the PCSO to warn him off his wife, Vanessa, 35, who had been in a relationship with Mr Morris several years ago.

Mr Morris suffered two black eyes, a broken arm and numerous cuts to his head, body and arms during the assault on February 19.

Teagle, from Bristol, was later arrested and admitted causing actual bodily harm at Bristol Magistrates Court.

James King, prosecuting, told the court Vanessa had previously been in a relationship with Mr Morris but their relationship ended when Teagle warned him off.

But they met up again last December and began having an affair when Vanessa told Mr Morris she and Teagle were getting a divorce.

Mr King said: 'On February 19 he (Mr Morris) left the police station having finished his shift.

'He says he had a text from Vanessa Phelps inviting him to an address.

'He went to the address, knocked on the door and it was answered by the defendant who proceeded to assault him.'

In a statement read to the court Mr Morris said: 'I thought he was going to speak to me but he threw a volley of punches, using both his hands, into my face.

'I recall falling to the floor and landing on my back. I attempted to crawl away from Tony but he repeatedly stamped on my head, arm and face. I looked up and he was using both feet to stamp on me.

'I crawled backwards and was in the back corner of the driveway near the road. He was using a wooden fence so he could use both feet to stamp on my head.

'I was holding both arms up to block his feet and to protect my head. I would say he stamped on my head approximately four times.'

Mr Morris was taken to Bristol Royal Infirmary suffering from two swollen black eyes, cuts to his nose, neck, back, torso and head and a broken right arm.

Police arrested Teagle and he admitted sending two text messages to Mr Morris asking him to come to the house.

Mr King added: 'He had been angry and upset by Mr Morris’s responses which suggested he wanted to do something sexual to Vanessa.

'He said he had gone to the door with the intention of warning him off but became enraged and punched him in the head. He denied stamping on his head or arm.'

Katy Welch, defending, said Teagle only accepts that he caused Mr Morris actual bodily harm on the basis that he repeatedly punched him.

Magistrates adjourned the case to Bristol Crown Court for sentencing and a hearing for a judge to decide whether Teagle did stamp on Mr Morris’s head and arms.

Teagle was released on unconditional bail and will appear at Bristol Crown Court next month.
