Rosamunde Pilcher is so popular German tourists more are visiting her home region where she set many of her stories

The number of German tourists visiting Devon and Cornwall has shot up because if its links with former Mills and Boon author Rosamunde Pilcher. 

Pilcher, who is now 88, set many of her romance tales in the South West region which have been transformed into long-running television adaptations in Germany with German actors. 

The shows have become the Downton Abbey of the country with as many as seven million viewers tuning in on Sunday nights to catch the drama.

Pilcher and her 'Aga sagas' have proved so popular, there are now Pilcher-themed tours which take German visitors around the South West of England to see the sites which feature in her books.

According to figures from Visit Britain there was a 14 per cent increase in German tourists visiting Cornwall and Devon last year. 

But the total number of Germans visiting the UK rose by less than one per cent.

Visitor numbers from other countries have been falling.

Mrs Pilcher was born in Lelant, Cornwall, and began writing Mills and Boon romances in 1949 under the name Jame Fraser.

Her works include Cliffs of Love and The Shell Seekers.

The writer, who now lives in Scotland, told The Daily Telegraph: 'I think I am more popular in Germany than I am here. 

'Having lived through the war, I am pleased to have played my very little role in helping to put it behind us.'

Niall MacDougall, from Urlaub Cornwall, a Truro-based marketing company, said it is highly likely that visitors will spot a German film crew or hear a German accent when visiting the region in the summer.

'The Germans are keeping some tourism businesses afloat', he said.
