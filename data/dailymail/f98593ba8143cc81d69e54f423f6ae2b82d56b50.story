We're already worried about our flabby stomachs, our wobbly bottoms and our bingo wings. But there's always room for one more thing to fret over...

The latest area women are concerned about is the upper torso - and one London clinic is targeting our insecurities, offering 'bra strap liposuction' which claims to banish back fat in just three hours.

Piqued interest from women hoping to simultaneously tone up arms, underarms and upper back areas all at the same has led to the Private Clinic in Harley Street launching a new microliposuction procedure - costing at least £2,600.

There is a new area in particular that more women than ever before are concerned about: the upper torso

The procedure involves 
mapping out areas around the upper arms, underneath the arms and around 
the patient's upper back where the bra straps sit, in order to pinpoint 
tiny pockets where unwanted fat is located.

These
areas are then sculpted using Microcannula Tumescent 
Liposuction (Microlipo), delivered under local anaesthetic.

This process - which lasts between two and three hours and starts from £2,600 -
involves a very diluted local anaesthesia being injected into targeted 
areas of fat, and then gently removing the fat using micro cannulas, 3mm
in diameter.

The Private Clinic have clinics nationwide where they offer Mircolipo - especially around the bra strap

The clinic treated twice the number of patients for Microliposuction procedures in 2012 as it did in 2010.

In this time, Dr Puneet Gupta, cosmetic doctor at the clinic, has 
seen a surge in numbers of women requesting more than one area to be
treated, rather than women simply requesting their arms, back or flanks
to be targeted.

By targeting multiple areas of the 
upper body at a time, the patient's 'problem areas' are delicately 
shaped, reducing overhang and providing women with a more slim-line 
upper body shape.

The 
procedure is delivered by Dr Gupta, the only doctor in Europe trained 
in the Microcannula Tumescent Liposuction procure.

Dr Gupta said: 'When a patient comes 
to me with a desire to target the upper body, it is important that I 
take a step back and focus not only on that one specific area, but on 
the surrounding areas as well. It is not enough to target solely the 
upper arms; instead I take into consideration how a patient's body will 
appear when clothed and where the patient's underwear will sit. 

'It
is also important that I am able to achieve the desired result without 
the patient having to undergo a surgical procedure under general 
anaesthetic. Instead, Microliposuction to the bra strap area allows the 
patient to depart from treatment and return to their day to day routine 
almost immediately.'

Harley Street clinic LoveLite saw a 240 per cent rise in demand for their new fat freezing treatment as girls try to achieve a thigh gap, MailOnline reported in February.

Their treatment Lipoglaze, a non-invasive treatment that targets stubborn areas of fat, has previously been popular for fat reduction on the lower stomach, but since the thigh-gap trend emerged they found a surge in the number of women getting treatment on their inner thighs.

It works by attaching a vacuum-like device on the stubborn area of fat - in this case the inner thigh - the head then gently sucks the fat, warms the skin up and then freezes it to minus 10 degrees Celcius. The frozen fat cells then die and pass through the body naturally as waste products.

In August 2010 writer Avril Mair had knee lipo with Dr Georges Roma of Harley Street, a 'high-profile cosmetic doctor with a reputation for being able to eliminate cellulite and other supposedly incurable aesthetic misfortunes'.

He used his new Ultra Lipolyse machine which works like liposuction to vanquish fat, tightening the skin at the same time and improving its tone and texture.

'It's amazing for treating areas like the knees - and it's not even painful!' he enthuses. 'But you do need to wear a special garment afterwards.'

We asked leading plastic surgeon Nigel Mercer to keep a diary for a week in March 2011.

He wrote of his work at the Frenchay Hospital in Bristol.

'I saw three men with moobs this week alone and it’s on the increase, partly because we are all getting fatter. But I also see them on men who are otherwise fit.

'The best option is liposuction because it doesn’t leave scars.'
