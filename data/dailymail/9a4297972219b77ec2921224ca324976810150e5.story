Disgraced former governor Eliot Spitzer was one of two wealthy candidates who lost their local political races after spending more than $10million on the campaigns, campaign finance reports have revealed.

Spitzer spent $10.3million on his failed bid to become New York City's next comptroller, while billionaire grocery store magnate John Catsimatidis spent $10.4million on his race to win the Republican primary vote for the city's mayoral race.

The Wall Street Journal today cited the latest round of campaign disclosure statements that revealed how much the losses hurt the men’s respective wallets.

Last minute bid: Disgraced former governor Eliot Spitzer made a late- and costly- entry to the city's race for comptroller that ended up costing him $10.3million

Spitzer's late entry to the comptroller race caused a stir, not only because it put his prostitution scandal back in the headlines five years after he resigned from office, but also because of the sheer amount of money that he was willing to spend.

Apparently it wasn't enough as he ended up losing 48-52 to Scott Stringer, who spent about $6million.

'All along we knew it was going to be a close race,' Spitzer campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith told MailOnline at his party on the night of the primary.

'Yes people know Eliot and he has name recognition but Scott Stringer has the entire political establishment behind him- every union, every business.'

The breakdown between how much he actually contributed to his campaign and how much of the $10.3m came from public donations was not publicly available, but it is safe to assume that a good portion came from his own bank account.

Spitzer's net worth is not known, but the years since leaving the governor's mansion have been profitable ones for the Spitzers as Eliot and his wife Silda made a combined total of $4.27million in 2012 alone. 

Big spender: John Catsimatidis spent $10.4million on his failed bid to become the Republican nominee for the New York City mayoral race, and he has an estimated net worth of about $3.1billion

While Spitzer's family is very wealthy and his father Bernard is thought to have a net worth of around $500million, that is nothing compared to the Catsimatidis fortune.

The 65-year-old Greek-American grocery tycoon was pegged by Forbes as being worth $3.1billion though that may be on the low end of the spectrum.

Deep pockets: Billionaire Michael Bloomberg spent a whopping total of $265million on all three of his mayoral campaigns

His campaign to become the Republican mayoral candidate ended up costing $10.4million.

The wasted money apparently doesn't bother Catsimitidis, even though his rival Joe Lhota ended up beating him by 12 points after having only spent $3.8million on his campaign.

'You know how much it bothers me that my opponent said that I was trying to buy the election? Zero. Cause when people met me, they loved me. And I loved them,' Mr Catsimatidis told The Wall Street Journal.

In spite of the seven-figure sums that both Spitzer and Catsimatidis put up for their respective failures, both pale in comparison to the amounts that current mayor Michael Bloomberg spent on his three campaigns.

When the self-made billionaire first ran for office in 2001, he spent $73million on the campaign and entered himself into the record books for being the costliest non-presidential campaign in U.S. history up until that point.

He outdid himself in 2005 when he spent a further $84million to get re-elected and then a staggering $108million after the term limits restrictions were overturned, allowing him to hold on to the title of ‘Hizzoner’ until this November.

The whopping total of $265million that Bloomberg spent on his races- not to mention additional millions covering transition costs and other expenses- is a drop in the bucket for him, however, as his net worth is estimated to be around $31billion.

While he spent a fortune on the races, he didn’t cost the city very much himself as he took a salary of $1-per-year in office and opted to live in his own Upper East Side apartment so that Gracie Mansion, the building traditionally used to house the City’s mayor, could be rented out for events.
