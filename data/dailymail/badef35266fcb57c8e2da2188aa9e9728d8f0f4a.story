Labour is trying to 'bribe' Scottish voters with a 'vindictive' mansion tax raid on England to pay for 1,000 extra nurses north of the border, Boris Johnson claimed today.

The London Mayor said the policy to 'mug' people living in the South East was the result of a plan by Labour to win back voters from the SNP. 

The policy to fund 1,000 nurses was one of the first major announcements by Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy. 

Mr Murphy said the 'vast majority' of the money raised by the levy on homes worth more than £2million would come from London and the South East but it was 'fair that you share that tax across the country'. 

Labour's Scottish leader Jim Murphy said 95% of mansion tax will be levied in the South East but that its 'benefit will be felt across the UK' 

But Mr Johnson told LBC: 'Labour has made a cynical calculation that they are more vulnerable in Scotland to the SNP than they are, say, in the South East or they are in London.

'They have decided to punish the South East, or to be fiscally vindictive towards the south east of England, in order to try to bribe the Scots to vote Labour. It's no way to run a country.'

He added that Labour wanted to 'squeeze those Londoners until the pips squeak' and added: 'That is a way to set up resentments and I don't think it is the right way forward.

'Londoners perfectly accept that we have a duty to the rest of the country, we already export huge quantities in taxation - about £19 billion a year.'

Mr Murphy said the mansion tax would send £250million a year north of the border – even though just 0.3 per cent of the revenue will be raised there.

He said it enabled him to make a 'uniquely Labour pledge' to increase spending on the Scottish NHS without having to increase taxes on Scots.

He added: 'As much as 95 per cent of the mansion tax will be levied in the South East of the UK but its benefit will be felt across the UK.

'There is a choice about what we would do with that money raised outside of Scotland and how we spend it in Scotland.'

Launching Scottish Labour's election campaign, Mr Murphy added: 'We will support the NHS and nurses and use the money from a UK mansion tax to fund an additional 1,000 NHS nurses in Scotland over and above the SNP plans that we inherit.'

Labour's proposed mansion tax on homes worth more than £2million has proved hugely controversial, with experts – and many senior Labour figures – warning it is unworkable and divisive.

Mr Murphy's comments also sparked an angry reaction in England. Conservative MP Dominic Raab, whose constituency is in Surrey, said it was deeply unfair to 'clobber' middle-class families in England to pay for health improvements in Scotland.

'Yet again, we're seeing the Labour Party selling out the English,' he said.

'It's bad enough they want to clobber the South with more stealth taxes that will inevitably hit the middle classes.

'But Scotland already has double the number of nurses per person compared to England. How is it fair to siphon off the lion's share of this revenue north of the border to pay for even more?'

Tory deputy chief whip Greg Hands said: 'Every voter in London should read Labour's proposal for a homes tax in London to pay for the NHS in Scotland.'

Full details of the mansion tax have yet to be announced, but Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said last year that people living in homes valued at between £2million and £3million will face an annual bill of £3,000, regardless of income.

Critics warn London and the South East will bear the brunt, while fewer than 900 homes in Scotland would be affected – 0.3 per cent of the UK total.

But because of the controversial Barnett Formula applied to UK funding, Scotland will be handed a vastly disproportionate share of the takings.
