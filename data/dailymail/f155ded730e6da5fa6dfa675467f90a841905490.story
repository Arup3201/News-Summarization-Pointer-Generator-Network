A married couple were tied up and the husband pistol-whipped during a robbery on Long Island on Halloween, police said today.

The 34-year-old mother opened her door in Farmingdale, Long Island on Friday around 8.45pm expecting trick-or-treaters out for candy. 

Instead she was confronted by three masked robbers, two of them armed with guns, who barged inside the home.

A mother of two-year-old boy opened her door to give candy to trick-or-treaters on Friday night on this street in Farmingdale, Long Island (pictured) only to have five armed men barge in and rob the home 

The robbers pistol-whipped the husband, 48, after he refused an order to sit down before the couple  were bound at the hands and feet with duct tape.

The couple's two-year-old son was not tied up and was not harmed. Two additional subjects joined the group and all began to ransack the home.

Police said the woman freed herself and ran next door with her son where she called 911 while the robbers were still in the home.

A total of five robbers fled the scene. The husband was treated for head lacerations at a local hospital.

According to detectives at Nassau County Police Department, the value of items stolen from the house are undetermined at this time.

The suspects were described as one black male, 5’8” 200lbs with a white mask and dark clothes; one black male, 5’9', 180 pounds with a werewolf mask, black clothes and armed with a handgun; another male, possibly white, 5'9', 200lb, with a gun and a third black male wearing a wool hat and mask. 

The fifth suspect is believed to be a black female; 5'8' with a thin build, afro hair and wearing goggles.  

Police said anyone with information can call Crime Stoppers anonymously at 1-800-244-TIPS.
