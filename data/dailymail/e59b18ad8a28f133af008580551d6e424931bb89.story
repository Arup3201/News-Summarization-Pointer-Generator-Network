Countdown has become a Guinness world record holder after clocking up 70 series.

Presenters on the challenging words and numbers show will be handed the award for ‘most series broadcast for a TV game show’ during its 6,000th edition today.

The show, which was the first programme broadcast when Channel 4 launched in 1982, was originally presented by Carol Vorderman and the late Richard Whiteley.

The current line-up: Susie Dent, Nick Hewer and Rachel Riley will be presented with Guinness World Record

Current host Nick Hewer – only its fifth in 32 years – said: 'It is a huge honour to front Countdown, now recognised by Guinness World Records for its longevity.

'Having 32 years under its belt, I am only a novice, coming up to three years on the show.

'But I and the whole team are incredibly proud to be part of such a durable and intelligent format that relies on intellect rather than prize money.'

Craig Glenday, editor-in-chief of Guinness World Records, said: 'The show - the first ever shown on Channel 4 - has long been a cornerstone of British popular culture, and its 70 series attest to its class, quality and pure entertainment value.

'It’s every bit a part of TV time as the cuppa itself, and I’m looking forward to its next 6,000 episodes.'

The words and number contest was launched by late presenter Richard Whiteley and has also been fronted by Des Lynam and Jeff Stelling.

An official from Guinness World Records will hand over an award to presenter Nick Hewer, maths whizz Rachel Riley and dictionary corner guru Susie Dent in today's episode.
