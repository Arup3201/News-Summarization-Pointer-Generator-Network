For the first time, white students are now outnumbered by ethnic minorities in American state schools.

White children now make up 49.7 per cent of the 50million in America’s state schools, down from 63.4 per cent in 1997.

There were 29.2million white students in 1997, with this figure dropping to 24.9million in 2014, which still makes them the largest single ethnic group.

The U.S Department of Education predicts that by 2023, the number of white students enrolled in U.S public schools will have decreased to 23.5million, giving them a 45 per cent share of enrolment.

The number of Hispanic public school students is projected to increase from 12.9million to 15.6million by 2023, meaning that they will make up 30 per cent of all pupils. In 1997 there were around just six million Hispanic students.

The number of Hispanic students is forecast to overtake whites by 2043.

The number of black students, meanwhile, has remained about the same at 7.7million since 1997.

Their enrollment share is projected to decrease from 16 to 15 percent by 2023.

The number of Asian/Pacific Islander students is projected to increase to 2.9 million, and their enrollment share in 2023 is projected to be 5 per cent.

Despite diversity increasing, segregation in U.S schools is still a major issue – one that President Obama is particularly concerned about.

The Civil Right Project at UCLA, using Education Department data, has found that segregation has been increasing since 1990, and that black students nationally are substantially more segregated than they were in 1970. Around the country, only 23 percent of black students attended white-majority schools in 2011. 

That's the lowest number since 1968 and far below the peak of 44 percent in 1988. And segregation is also affecting Latino students, the largest minority group in the public schools. They now are more likely to attend school with other Latinos than black students are with other blacks.

Many advocates blame this on the federal courts for removing school districts from desegregation orders. The changing demographics of the school system -the withdrawal of white students from the public systems and the booming Latino population -also contribute to the changing colors of the schools.

Civil rights data recently released by the Education Department showed glaring disparities remain in all aspects of education. Among the findings: minority students are less likely to have access to advanced math and science classes, and to have new teachers. 

Black students of any age -even preschoolers - are more likely to be suspended. And, there continue to be gaps between the performance on national assessments between whites and black and Hispanic students, with whites scoring higher.

In a recent bit of good news, high school graduation rates increased 15 percentage points for Hispanic students and 9 percentage points for African-American students from 2006 to 2012, according to a recent GradNation Report. 

Hispanic students graduated at 76 percent and African-American students at 68 percent in 2012, the report said. The national rate is 80 percent.
