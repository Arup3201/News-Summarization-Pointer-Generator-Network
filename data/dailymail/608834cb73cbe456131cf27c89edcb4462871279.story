A million fewer shoppers turned out on Boxing Day compared to last year as Britain began to tire of discounts after more than a month of heavy promotions.

Around seven million shoppers hit our high streets, shopping centres and retail parks on Friday, according to exclusive figures given to The Mail on Sunday.

That was 12.4 per cent down on the same day last year as shoppers suffered 'sales fatigue', said market research firm Springboard.

Experts say Boxing Day sales are dwindling in popularity because of the rise of Black Friday in November

There was a 12.4 per cent drop on Boxing Day this year  as shoppers suffered 'sales fatigue'

Shoppers in Selfridges, in Oxford Street, hunted around for a bargain on Boxing Day 

More turned out yesterday than on Boxing Day, but the overall numbers were down on December 27 last year. 

But the number shopping online on Boxing Day jumped 47 per cent on last year, said Postcode Anywhere, which tracks customer addresses.

Experts warn Boxing Day is losing relevance as retailers focus on Black Friday in late November, pulling spending forward. In the US, Black Friday lures shoppers out the day after Thanksgiving.

It was imported here three years ago by retailers including US online giant Amazon, and Asda, owned by US retail giant Wal-Mart. 

The stampede in online traffic meant that shops were quieter than in recent years

This year, chains such as John Lewis, Tesco and Currys followed suit, but many shops were caught out. 

Parcel firms said retailers underestimated demand, millions of orders flooding the system before they were ready.

The shift meant mid-December was quieter than usual. 'Black Friday then led to a lull as shoppers only have so much money,' said Springboard's Diane Wehrle.

After a rush on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, shoppers then took a day off.

However, numbers visiting all retail locations from November 24 to Boxing Day rose 4.8 per cent. Shopping centres and retail parks led the increase.
