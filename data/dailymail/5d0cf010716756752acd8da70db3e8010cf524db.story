To celebrate 150 years of skiing in Switzerland, a series of iconic posters will go under the hammer at a Christie's auction in January. 

Every January, The Ski Sale at Christie’s, South Kensington, London, presents enthusiasts of the world’s foremost winter sport with an extensive selection of vintage posters depicting the action on the slopes and the stunning mountain scenery, capturing an era of glamour. 

This year the sale features an impressive group of ski posters from Switzerland as well as popular and rare posters from France, Italy, Austria, Germany, Norway and Australia, with a section dedicated to US and Canadian resorts.  

Carl Moos' (1878-1959) design advertising St Moritz is estimated to go for between £18,000 - £22,000, and right, Emil Cardinaux's (1877-1936) poster for Zermatt is hoped to fetch £8,000 - £12,000

Switzerland was the most prolific country for ski tourism posters during the 20th century and amongst the first to establish ski resorts, which remain popular to this day. 

The 2014/15 winter sees Switzerland celebrate 150 years of winter tourism: St Mortiz and Davos welcomed their first guests in 1864 and 1865 respectively. 

The new year also marks the 150th anniversary of the first Matterhorn ascent, which the village of Zermatt will celebrate with events and festivities. 

Sascha Maurer's (1897-1961) design for Crawford Notch, New Hampshire, US is hoped to be bought for £1,800 - £2,200, and right, Leonetto Cappiello's (1875-1942) sketch of skiing at Superbagnères-Luchon is estimated to rake in £5,000 - £7,000

Franz Lenhart's (1898-1992) Madonna di Campiglio design in north Italy is hoped to collect £2,000 - £3,000 and right, Roger Broders's (1883-1953) portrait for St Pierre de Chartreuse, France is estimated to fetch between £10,000 - £15,000

T.N. Joanethis's sketch for Dartmouth, New Hampshire, US is hoped to collect  £2,500 - £3,500 and right, Schol's graphic for Zermatt is hoped to fetch between  £4,000 - £6,000

The Ski Sale comprises a fantastic group of 20th century posters advertising Swiss resorts, including St Moritz, Davos, Zermatt, Gstaad and Verbier.

Highlights are Carl Moos’ St Moritz (estimate: £18,000 - £22,000); a 1918 poster for Davos by Emil Cardinaux (estimate: £12,000 - £18,000); and a group of Zermatt posters depicting the iconic mountain, such as a 1947 lithograph in colours designed by Schol (estimate: £4,000 - £6,000).

Head of the Ski Sale Nicolette Tomkinson told MailOnline Travel: ‘Over time we have seen the Ski Sale increase in popularity among private individuals looking to acquire posters depicting specific skiing destinations. 

This personal interest among clients in certain resorts or mountain regions that relate to their own experience of skiing has led to a significant increase in ski posters being purchased as pieces to complement the interior décor of their chalets. 

'The most popular ski posters tend to be those that depict the world’s most important, glamourous and well-loved ski resorts, including St Moritz, Klosters and Davos; all of which will feature in the 2015 sale. 

'The value of a work is primarily determined by its availability, condition, and the artist. Whether the posters depict mountain ranges, skiers in action or one of the glamourous resort hotels, collectors remain attracted to the works for the colourful and decorative designs which can still be acquired relatively inexpensively.'

These iconic posters are offered alongside 25 lots of vintage Louis Vuitton travel luggage. Estimates range from £800 to £80,000.
