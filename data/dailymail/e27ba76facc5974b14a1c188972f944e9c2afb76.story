Italian prosecutors are preparing to use Amanda Knox's alleged links to a cocaine dealer to extradite her to Italy, it has been reported.

Police papers allegedly show calls had been made between the 26-year-old American and a drug dealer in the days before and after the murder of Meredith Kercher.

Knox has vowed she would never 'willingly' return to Italy, where she and ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito were reconvicted earlier this year of the killing of 21-year-old Miss Kercher. Both Knox and Sollecito are appealing the verdict.

Now, prosecutors are looking to use the information allegedly linking Knox to a drug dealer to extradite her back to the country, The Mirror has reported.

According to the paper, local media has claimed numbers found on her mobile phone also helped lead to the discovery of a drug ring.

Sollecito and Knox were originally sentenced to 25 and 28 years in prison, respectively, for the murder of Kercher in Perugia and served four years before being released on appeal in 2011.

On January 30, an Italian appeals court reconvicted the pair of murdering Miss Kercher - a ruling the pair are again appealing.

Rudy Hermann Guede is serving 16 years after a separate fast-track hearing in 2008.

On
 Tuesday it was reported Knox could no longer rely on Sollecito being 
her alibi after he denied she was with him the whole of the night on 
which Miss Kercher was murdered.

Knox and Sollecito have always maintained
 that they were together the evening of the brutal 2007 murder after 
which Miss Kercher was found half naked her throat slit in the cottage 
she shared with Knox.

But Sollecito's lawyer Giulia Bongiorno said that 'for the entire first part of the evening, they were not together. It’s this first part of the evening that’s new [to his defence]'.

Sollecito has pointed to phone records that show that Knox was away from his house for part of the evening.

In a dramatic change of legal tactics that he announced in a press conference in Rome he has now claimed there are ‘anomalies’ in Knox’s story.
