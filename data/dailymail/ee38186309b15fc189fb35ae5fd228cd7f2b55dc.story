Manchester United have finally received some positive injury news after Marouane Fellaini returned to full training and Ander Herrera expressed his determination to be back in action within a fortnight.

Fellaini and Herrera are among 10 United players who have been sidelined through injury since the beginning of the season, severely hindering the start of Louis van Gaal’s Old Trafford reign.

The Belgium midfielder has been sidelined for the last five weeks since suffering ligament damage in his left ankle in training after playing in the opening game against Swansea.

The £27.5million signing from Everton has resumed training with the first-team squad at Carrington this week although it appears unlikely that he will be ready to face his old club at Old Trafford on Sunday.

Fellaini predicted that he would be back at the end of September when he spoke last week about his determination to make a success of his move to United.

‘I have known difficult moments like last season, but you become a stronger player afterwards,’ said the Belgian. ‘I have confidence in myself and in my game again.

New signing Ander Herrera is determined to recover from his rib injury within a fortnight

‘I played a good World Cup and I was also good during pre-season. It is unfortunate that this injury has thrown a spanner in the works, but at the end of the month I will be back.’

Herrera fractured a rib in his back in Saturday’s win over West Ham and was expected to be out of action for up to a month.

United’s £29m summer signing from Athletic Bilbao is believed to have caught a knee in the back from an opponent in the first half and played on until the 74th minute.

The club offered him the opportunity to have a break while he recovers, but Herrera has made it clear that he can be fit to play again in two weeks after the forthcoming international break.

Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has had to deal with a growing list of injuries so far this season

Darren Fletcher is set to replace Herrera against Everton while Juan Mata is expected to be recalled in place of the suspended Wayne Rooney.

There was more promising news from Van Gaal  as it emerged that Michael Carrick and Phil Jones are running outside again, although they are not ready to rejoin the main first-team group.

Carrick has yet to play this season after undergoing ankle surgery in July and Jones suffered a hamstring strain in England’s win over Switzerland three weeks ago.
