An illegal immigrant has been sent to jail and told he must serve his sentence in Britain after he was caught trying to leave the UK and go home to look after his mother.

Albi Shabanaj was stopped by border guards as he tried to exit the country through the Channel Tunnel on his way back to Albania.

The 24-year-old was found to have fake Greek identification papers which he had bought during time working in the EU before sneaking into the UK.

Jailed: The illegal immigrant tried to leave Britain via the Channel Tunnel but was jailed for a year, which he will serve in a UK jail

Canterbury Crown Court heard how Shabanai had tried to get work in Britain in order to send money home, but was caught as he tried to travel home to Albania on April 16 this year.

James Bilsland, prosecuting, told the court than Shabanai, of no fixed address, was caught when he tried to get back to Albania to see his sick mother.

Refusal: Britain's attempt to deport Tsai Wang Chen, 39, has failed because of the Human Rights Act

Shabanai told border guards that he was concerned about his mother and that he wanted to be back home in time for her having an operation on April 17.

He admitted possession of fake identity documents with improper intention - which he bought for 100 Euros while in Greece last year - and was jailed for a year last week.

It came as a Chinese gangster who was jailed for kidnap and blackmail avoided deportation because he has forged a new life in a Christian retreat centre and sending him back would 'devastate' him.

Tsai Wang Chen, 39, was told he could stay in Britain after his lawyers used human rights laws to argue it would breach his right to a private life if he was sent back.

The convicted criminal lives for free in Ministeracres, near Consett, in Northumberland and spends his days looking after hens, growing vegetables and helping with the cleaning.

The Home Office blew thousands of pounds in their failed bid to have him sent back to China.

Chen was a 'snakehead' gangster - a group who are paid to smuggle people into the country - who was convicted of kidnap, false imprisonment and blackmail.

He was locked up for six years by Judge Paul Clark at Oxford Crown Court in 1997 for the violent crime. But after his release he has created a new life for himself at the sheltered Christian retreat centre.
