A prized pig owned by Princess Anne has been killed by a wild boar after he broke into the pen at her home.

The attack came just hours after another wild boar caused an accident which killed a man on the M4, 15 miles away.

Anne’s beloved Gloucestershire Old Spot was killed on Tuesday night at her Gatcombe Park estate in Gloucestershire.

The Queen’s daughter is particularly passionate about the rare breed and in 2009 became patron of the Gloucestershire Old Spots Pig Breeders’ Club.

She revealed details of the attack during a speech to the Oxford Farming Conference yesterday, telling delegates: ‘We had a visit last night on our farm from a wild boar. 

'My Gloucestershire Old Spot boar is no longer with us as a result.’ Like Prince Charles, Anne is a keen farmer and has kept pigs at Gatcombe for many years.

On Monday night, a man died in a crash on the M4 when his car collided with a wild boar and was subsequently hit by a lorry. The incident has renewed fears that Britain’s wild boar population – believed to run into the hundreds – is out of control.

Wild boar can weigh up to 20 stone when fully grown, run up to 30mph and are able to jump as high as 6ft to get over barriers.

They were hunted to extinction in Britain hundreds of years ago but have had a resurgence since farming them became fashionable in the 1970s. Dr Zoe Davies, chief executive officer of the National Pig Association, said she had huge sympathy for the Princess. 

‘The problem is that DEFRA [Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] have absolved all responsibility for wild boar to individual landowners. There is no strategy to deal with them and no one knows how many there really are,’ she said. 

‘Those who escape into the wild become feral very quickly and breed well. They are incredibly resourceful animals.’

Dr Davies said some pig farmers have complained of wild boar breaking in to breed with their sows and feast on animal feed.

 ‘They don’t tend to be aggressive unless confronted but sows are protective of their young and if two males get together, which appears may have happened to Princess Anne, then they will fight,’ she added.

One of their strongholds is in the Forest of Dean, where a controversial cull recently took place to reduce numbers. Campaign group Friends of the Wild Boar says the cull should not resume because the population of wild boar is much lower than believed.

Last night, a Buckingham Palace aide described Anne as being ‘very hands on’ with her farm.
