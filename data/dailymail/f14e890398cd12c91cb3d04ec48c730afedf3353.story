Former BBC director-general Greg Dyke has attacked Lord Patten over the ongoing management crisis at the corporation.

Mr Dyke has said that Lord Patten, chairman of the BBC Trust, has no relevant experience for the job and was simply working out how he could become an ‘all-powerful BBC chairman’.

He suggested that former director-general George Entwistle, who resigned 54 days into the job over  the Jimmy Savile and Newsnight scandals, had been ‘manoeuvred’ into the position but was given no support from management when he needed it.

Writing in the Daily Telegraph today, Mr Dyke said that in the short-term, the BBC has been ‘clearly damaged’ but that under new director-general Tony Hall, the corporation will recover.

Mr Dyke wrote: ‘Lord Patten… has no real experience of running any sort of organisation was appointed chairman of the trust.

‘Within a matter of months, it was clear, to me at least, that he was working out how he could be an all-powerful BBC chairman.

‘He manoeuvred into (Mark) Thompson’s place George Entwistle, someone with limited managerial experience and no experience of dealing with a crisis.’

The starting point of BBC’s total 
collapse of morale at Newsnight, the BBC's flagship current affairs 
programme, came after its investigation exposing Jimmy Savile as a 
paedophile was canned late last year in favour of a Christmas tribute to
the BBC star.

What made 
matters worse was that ITV broadcast its own exposé on Savile in 
September, using much of the material Newsnight had gathered as evidence
against the disgraced DJ.

The editor, Peter Rippon, has stepped aside as a result of the scandal.

Mr Dyke said that Lord Patten was ‘smitten’ with Mr Entwistle when selecting from candidates.

He wrote of Lord Patten: ‘So why was 
he so smitten with George? The argument goes that he was Patten’s sort 
of person – male, white, urbane, intellectual and public school 
educated.'

Mr Entwistle was appointed and started 
work in September before being overwhelmed by both the Jimmy Savile and 
Newsnight scandals and quit after 54 days.

Mr Dyke wrote: ‘Figures show that this trust has now been broken and the biggest job Tony Hall has is to rebuild it.’

Mr Dyke suggested that the current affairs and news departments, which were merged nearly 20 years ago, should be broken up ‘so that daily shows like Newsnight don’t get involved in long-term, costly investigation’.

He also suggested that Lord Hall must change the BBC’s complex management structure.

He said: ‘The problem is that there are “acting” leaders in virtually all the top jobs.

‘A wealth of experience was lost after George Entwistle was appointed – people whom the BBC could have used to steady the ship and plan the future.’ 

Lord Hall of Birkenhead, who first applied to be DG 13 years ago, replaced George Entwistle and was given a brief to regain public trust in the corporation.

A former director of BBC News, the cross-bench peer previously applied to run the corporation in 1999 but lost out to Mr Dyke.

Lord Hall, 61, will take up the £450,000-a-year post in March and has been tasked by chairman Lord Patten with ‘rebuilding the BBC’s reputation’ in journalism.

The chairman also revealed that Lord Hall had been initially approached to replace Mark Thompson earlier this year but he declined at the time, fearing that at 61 he was ‘too old’ for the job.
