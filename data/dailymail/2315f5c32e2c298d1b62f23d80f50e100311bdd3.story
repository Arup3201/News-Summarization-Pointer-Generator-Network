It was given the royal seal of approval when Princess Beatrice and Zara Phillips stepped out wearing it this month, and it seems that royals, celebrities and the British public can't get enough of New Look.

The high street store has been crowned British women's favourite place to shop on the high street, knocking last season's winner, Zara from the top spot.

According to new research conducted by leading brand recommendation site dressipi.com for its annual FBI (Fashion Brands Index), New Look beat the likes of H&M and Topshop to take first place.

In the survey of 10,000 women conducted over a six-month period, almost a quarter (24 per cent) of respondents named New Look as their favourite of all high street brands.

The results for the six months from June to December 2013 reveal that the once unassailable Zara has slipped to second place in consumers’ affections as the favourite brand of 23 per cent of women.

This figure represents a 10 per cent drop on the brand’s ratings among British women in the twelve months since December 2012.

Further down the FBI top ten, H&M and Topshop vie for third place, with an equal share of 21 per cent of votes, both posting a slight decline of 1 per cent on the previous six month period.

Fifth and sixth placed retailers were Next and River Island with Dorothy Perkins in equal seventh with new entrant Primark.

Famous fans: Lucy Watson in a £59.99 coat, Billie Faiers in a £17.99 skirt and her sister Sam in a £59.99 jumpsuit from the high-street store, which has clinched the top spot in the nation's affections

A spokesperson for Dressipi said: 'We
 could see from the New Look autumn/winter press preview earlier in the 
year that it was going to be a strong season for the retailer - way 
before the clothes had even hit the stores. 

'Their
 trend translation is spot-on without being too obvious, with pieces 
that easily work a number of outfits in a number of wardrobes spanning a
 good age range.

'It would be easy to put New Look's success over Zara down to price points, but really where the high street is concerned these days it is also very much a case of cleverly getting the balance of trend, basics, versatility and wow-factor product right.

'New Look has been an increasingly important force in UK fashion for a while now, but really broke through in 2013 with strong spring and summer collections and a couple of smart celebrity collaborations, including one with Kelly Brook.'

Contender: New Look, famed for its purse-friendly, fashion-forward designs, has beaten Topshop and Zara to be crowned the nation's favourite high street store

New Look was founded in 1969 and its first ever store was in Taunton, Somerset.

Fast forward to 2013 and New Look now operates across a chain of over 1,000 stores internationally.

Famous fans of the purse friendly fashion include Michelle Keegan, the TOWIE cast, Lucy Watson and Kerry Katona.
