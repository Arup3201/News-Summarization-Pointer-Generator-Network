Mark Noble will use advice from Frank Lampard to bounce back from his painful penalty miss in the defeat to Tottenham at the weekend.

The West Ham midfielder - who had scored his previous 10 spot-kicks - uncharacteristically put the ball wide during the first-half at Upton Park.

And the miss proved costly when debutant Eric Dier scored the winner for Spurs in the second minute of stoppage time.

Out of character: Mark Noble missed a penalty in West Ham's opening day defeat to Tottenham

Wide of the mark: With Hugo Lloris diving the wrong way, Noble saw his penalty slide agonisingly wide

Spot on: Noble remembered some advice from former Hammer Frank Lampard about penalty-taking

But Noble said he will recall some advice given to him by the Chelsea and England star the next time he steps up from 12 yards.

Noble said: 'Frank came up to me after and said: 'Make sure you take the next one and smash it in the back of the net.'

Late blow: Eric Dier struck to win the match for Tottenham in the second minute of stoppage time

'I will never forget those words - and hopefully I'll be doing just that. I've always said to myself there will be a day when I miss one.

'We got a harsh lesson on Saturday. It really was heartache to miss against Spurs. But I will still be stepping up for the next penalty we have.'
