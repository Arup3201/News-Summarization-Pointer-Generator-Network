But tea and coffee is not restricted, according to The Moscow Times.

The restrictions came into effect on January 1. 

An overview of the law on the regional legislative assembly's website states stores will have to ask for identification when selling certain soft drinks to young people. 

In addition to the outright ban on sales of carbonated caffeine drinks to minors, the law also prohibits their sale in 'children's, educational and medical institutions, as well as cultural and sports centers.'

Yevgeny Korotkov, chair of the parliament's committee on economic policy and property, said the ban has been put in place to protect the health of minors.

He said: 'We received an expert opinion on the effects of these drinks on the body of children and adolescents, and they have a very negative impact.' 

It comes as Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov told the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that Russians are prepared to 'eat less' for President Vladimir Putin.

Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos today, he warned the West against trying to topple Putin and said that Russians are ready to sacrifice their wealth in support.

Russia has been sliding into recession for the past year amid a slump in its energy export prices as well as Western sanctions against Moscow's role in the conflict in Ukraine. 

Shuvalov, who is believed to be one of the richest men in the government, said that what he considers the West's attempts to oust Putin will only unite the nation further.

He said: 'When a Russian feels any foreign pressure, he will never give up his leader. 

'Never. We will survive any hardship in the country — eat less food, use less electricity.'
