Offering free coffee and newspapers may have proved popular with some shoppers – but Waitrose’s loyalty scheme has not been enough to save it from the vicious supermarket price wars.

The upmarket store had appeared to be immune from the supermarket shake-up that has seen the ‘big four’ – Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons – lose out to increasingly successful budget rivals.

But Waitrose’s ‘substantial investment’ in the giveaways has come at a price, and yesterday the chain issued its second profit warning in just three years.

The supermarket has also been forced 
to cut its prices on key staples such as bread and milk to try to 
compete with discount chains Aldi and Lidl.

And although Waitrose has seen its 
market share soar over the past few years, it is about to be overtaken 
by Aldi.

Figures from research firm Kantar show Aldi now controls 4.8 
per cent of the market, just behind Waitrose at 4.9 per cent.

Waitrose

Sales growth: Up 6.7 per cent

Market share: 4.9 per cent

Latest profits: £297million

Aldi 

Sales growth: Up 32.2 per cent

Market share: 4.8 per cent

Latest profits: £157.9million

Waitrose managing director Mark Price 
said that huge investment into the myWaitrose loyalty card scheme, 
price-matching campaigns and promotions have affected the store’s 
profits.

He took the unusual step of writing to his staff to warn them: 
‘As you know, we are in a period of unprecedented investment and this 
will have an impact on the profit we report next month.’

Shoppers with a myWaitrose card – 
which was introduced in 2011 – receive a free coffee, including 
cappuccinos, lattes and mochas, even if they do not buy anything else.

They also receive a free copy of most daily quality newspapers if they 
spend more than £5.

The scheme, which has more than 
4million members, has been so successful that it is estimated the chain 
gives away 1million free cups of coffee and nearly 1million newspapers 
each week.

However, Waitrose has received some criticism over the giveaways.

Campaigners said the scheme was 
forcing smaller shops out of business, while some traditional shoppers 
felt it was attracting the ‘wrong type’ of customer.

Rivals: Waitrose' market share of 4.9 per cent is about to be overtaken by Aldi, which controls 4.8 per cent

In its efforts to see off rivals, 
Waitrose, which is a partnership effectively owned by its staff, has 
also been investing in its online grocery delivery service and has 
opened 15 branches over the past six months, 11 more than in the same 
period last year. It has also refurbished stores in what it says is a 
bid to make its shops fit for the future.

But Waitrose is now in the same 
bracket as Tesco and Morrisons, which have both issued profit warnings 
and have also been forced to invest hundreds of millions of pounds 
cutting prices, improving services and refreshing their stores.

Waitrose will post its half-year 
profit in September, expected to be less than the £160.2million posted 
for the same period last year.
