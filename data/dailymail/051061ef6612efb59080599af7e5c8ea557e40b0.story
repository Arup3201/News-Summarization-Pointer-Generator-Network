These adorable images of curled-up newborns are enough to warm the coldest of hearts.

Lynette Blackie, 32, owner of photography firm Pasha Photography, loves nothing more than capturing infants while they sleep or interact with the camera.

The award-winning photographer currently works from her home studio in Caldercriux near Glasgow, snapping the babies to give parents the perfect momentos of their newborns.

Lynette Blackie, owner of newborn photography firm Pasha Photography, captures adorable images of curled-up newborns - some, like this one, involving some rather creative styling

Lynette, a self-taught photographer, revealed sessions with newborns can take anything between two and four hours but she always allows babies to dictate the show.

Mother-of-three Lynette said: 'I generally ask that babies are brought for their session as soon after birth as possible - within the first two weeks is always the best time as they are still very sleepy at that age.

Lynette loves capturing young tots while they snooze, even if this means waiting until they drop off - sessions can take anything between two and four hours

Lynette, a self-taught photographer, says despite the sessions often taking hours, she always allows babies to dictate the show

Mother-of-three Lynette asks that babies are brought for their session as soon after birth as possible to capture those newborn moments

'The sessions can take up to four hours which allows time for feeds, changes and posing.

'I only shoot one newborn session per day as I would never want to rush anyone or make the little ones feel uncomfortable.

'Babies can be crying one minute and laughing the next so it's just a case of being patient and not rushing the parents because if they're relaxed then the baby will be more relaxed too.

'I absolutely adore babies and young children so I've always found that I have a natural ability with little ones.'

Lynette has a number of tricks up her sleeve to help the little ones doze off and perform the perfect pose.

Lynette often incorporates props, such as teddy bears, and warms the bean bag and blankets before placing the baby on them to make sure they are snug and don't wake when they are placed down

She says the trick is having a great deal of patience. 'The baby has to dictate what we do and when we do it which is why they can take so long but it's always worth it in the end,' she says

Lynette loves her jobs and often makes clients cry with joy because they're so proud of her work

Lynette says people see her images and become broody, have a baby and then bring them in for a photography session

She added: 'I make sure the room is really warm and it always helps if the babies have just been fed so they are nice and comfortable.

'I also warm the bean bag and blankets before placing the baby on them to make sure they are snug and don't wake when they are placed down.

'The key to newborn photography is patience. The baby has to dictate what we do and when we do it which is why they can take so long but it's always worth it in the end.

'There aren't many jobs where you make your clients cry and feel good about it because they're so proud of what you've done.

'It's interesting because I often have people comment that my images make them broody so I've had a fair few clients that have gone on to have a baby and brought them to me for a photography session.'

Lynette is due to launch her new studio at the Business Hub in Falkirk on April 1.

Lynette owns photography firm Pasha Photography and is set to open a new studio soon
