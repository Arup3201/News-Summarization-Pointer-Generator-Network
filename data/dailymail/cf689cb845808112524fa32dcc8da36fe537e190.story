With the X Factor final looming into view and sobbing contestants being whittled at a pace, it was time for Simon Cowell and his gang to celebrate reaching the crescendo of their show.

The team all got together at Mixology in LA for a viewing party; and a chance for Britney Spears to prove she's been going to the gym by showing off her toned body.

The 31-year-old looked great but it's her style choices that never work and her look on Thursday night edged her.

The mother-of-two picked a vaguely country inspired dress that featured a leather bustier, embroidered flowers AND lace panels.

Her
 hair; thick and luscious though it was... was a '90s in it's uniform 
blondeness and cascading waves although this wouldn't have mattered if 
her outfit was less fussy.

Spears
 still looked fantastic and was perhaps keen to show off acres of toned 
caramel flesh that attest to hours spent working out.

However, she was completely overtaken in
 the sartorial stakes by Khloe Kardashian who looked more stylish and 
(ironically) more contemporary in a retro inspired outfit.

Britney
 and Demi Lovato endured an emotional night on Wednesday as their 
contestants CeCe Frey and Diamond White were voted off The X Factor.

After struggling to gain Simon Cowell’s approval for weeks CeCe was the first to go, leaving her mentor Demi Lovato distraught.

'I hope that I taught everyone at home that you need to love who you are because the more you love who you are the less you are going to need anybody else to,’ said the 21-year-old who was sporting leopard-print face make-up and oversize cross earrings.

‘I have grown so close to you, I’m just so proud of you,’ Demi blubbered before hugging CeCe tight.

CeCe, who has been told by Cowell that she’s ‘not worth a $5million recording contract’ was forced to comfort her mentor.

To the delight of all the judges Britney’s protégée Carly Rose Sonenclar, 13, shot through to the semi finals, joining Emblem3, Fifth Harmony and Tate Stevens.
