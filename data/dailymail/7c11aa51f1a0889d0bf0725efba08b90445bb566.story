Amy Matthews was enjoying a night out on the famous bar and nightclub strip Bourbon Street in New Orleans, during a gap year trip in the US with one of her best friends.

The 21-year-old university graduate from Mount Hawthorn in Perth heard a gunshot, then another, and then she saw people screaming and running so she started running too.

After making it to the next street she stopped to take shelter when she noticed her face felt like it was on fire.

Ms Matthews said that if the bullet had hit her four centimetres higher or lower she likely would have died

The university graduate was enjoying a gap year holiday in the US when she got caught up in the incident on Bourbon Street which saw one girl killed and nine injured

'We were in the main bars and clubs area and it was packed,' Ms Matthews told New Idea.

'I never felt in any danger until I heard those shots.'

Her mouth was filling up with blood and when she opened it a number of her teeth fell out.

Two off-duty soldiers noticed she was severely injured and rushed to help her.

Using their medical training Gunnery Sergeant William McDaniel and a Naval Corpsman named Josh looked after her for half and hour until an ambulance arrived.

'It was only when they started talking about entry and exit wounds I realised I'd been shot,' Ms Matthews said.

'It was pretty scary but I think I was in too much shock to scream.'

A victim lies in the streets of New Orleans after a shooter injured ten people in June

Amy Matthews, 21, was shot in the face in New Orleans in July. She split her tongue, shattered her jaw and lost all but 10 of her teeth

Ms Matthews was shot in the right cheek and the bullet exited from her upper lip.

She lost all but 10 of her teeth, had to have her dead gums removed, her tongue stitched up and a metal plate inserted to support her shattered jaw.

She said that if the bullet had hit her four centimetres higher or lower she likely would have died.

One of the shooting suspects, Trung Le, is facing manslaughter and second degree murder charges

Ms Matthews was one of 10 people who were shot in the early hours of June 29. A 21-year-old US woman, Brittany Thomas, was killed.

Video footage of the street fight shows Ms Matthews and her friend walking past a bar on the busy street when gunshots send the crowd of people running.

One of the shooting suspects, Trung Le, is facing manslaughter and second degree murder charges. He has pleaded not guilty.

Last week in court a prosecutor acknowledged Le was not the person who shot and killed Ms Thomas. His attempted murder charge relates to his firing on another unidentified shooter.

Almost three months since the shooting Ms Matthews is desperately trying to raise $135,000 to pay for multiple face reconstruction surgeries and a new set of teeth, because her travel insurance will not cover the procedures.

Ms Matthews told Daily Mail Australia her insurance policy in emergency was to get the person 'fit to fly', which is why the cosmetic and dental surgeries are not covered.

'It feels so unfair we have to pay for something someone did to me for absolutely no reason,' she told New Idea.

But she has been overwhelmed by support from friends and total strangers since the tragic incident.

A friend set up a Facebook page called Repair Amy's smile to help raise money for Ms Matthews' surgeries, and it has been flooded with get-well-soon wishes from New Orleans locals and others.

'I don't love the way I look but I can deal with it. I won't let this stop me. I'll go travelling again when I'm better,' she said.

A street camera captured the shooting and the moments leading up to it

The 21-year-old accused shooter Le was originally arrested July 4 and booked on one count of first-degree murder and nine counts of attempted first-degree murder.

In August, a grand jury indicted Le but only on the lesser charges. Le's attorney has contended that his client acted in self-defense when he fired his weapon.

A wounded friend testified that Le likely saved his life after a still-unidentified man pointed a pistol at their group.

'I still feel like he's a hero, to this day. He's wearing that nasty orange jumpsuit he shouldn't be wearing,' said Robert Benvenuti, referring to his friend's Orleans Parish Prison attire.

'He doesn't deserve this.'

Benvenuti was shot four times but survived wounds to his leg, foot and buttocks.

Last month's testimony from three friends marked the first public show of support for Le by anyone present at the gunfight, which provoked local outrage and drew international attention because it took place in an area frequented by tourists.

New Orleans police said Le was one of two men who opened fire toward each other.

The second suspected gunman has not been arrested.

She is now trying to raise $135,000 to reconstruct her face because her travel insurance won't cover the costs
