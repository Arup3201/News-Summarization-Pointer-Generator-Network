The Czech car maker Skoda has long repaired the reputation for poor quality that once made it the butt of jokes.

Now it has passed another milestone on its journey to respectability after racking up annual global sales of more than a million cars for the first time in its history.

The company, which began as a bicycle maker in 1895 and is now owned by VW of Germany, sold 1,037,200 cars around the world last year, up 12.7 per cent on 2013.

Skoda CEO Dr Winfried Vahland said: 'By delivering more than one million vehicles for the first time in a single year, we have sustainably established ourselves as a volume manufacturer on the international markets with our modern model range.' 

Skoda factories produce cars in the Czech Republic but also in China, Russia, Slovakia and India and through local partners in Ukraine and Kazakhstan. 

It currently employs 25,800 people worldwide.

The company, whose range includes popular models such as the Superb, Yeti, Fabia and Octavia, now sells 1.4 per cent of cars in the world.
