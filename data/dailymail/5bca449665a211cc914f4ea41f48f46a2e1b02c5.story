A 16-year-old schoolgirl who was violently assaulted by a gang just yards from her home has posted pictures of her horrific facial injuries on Facebook in a bid to catch the attackers.

Amy Maddison, of Scarborough, North Yorkshire, was walking home late last Thursday when three men smashed her face against a wall - leaving her with a swollen lip and a bloody nose.

She decided to post a photo of the wounds they inflicted on social media and they have now been shared by almost 1,000 people.

The teenager hopes that by raising awareness of her ordeal, she will help police to bring the gang to justice, as members of the public might offer information on the thugs' identities.

Shockingly, the picture she used was taken after her mother had cleaned her face and wiped away all of the blood.

The part-time waitress had to delete photos taken before she received treatment, as it made her too upset to look at them.  

She said: 'I'm angry and confused, but I'm also sympathetic as anybody who does something like this must have nothing in their life.'

The sixth-former was walking home from a restaurant last Thursday just after 10pm when the three men began to hurl insults at her as she passed them.

She tried to ignore them and sped up - but suddenly felt hands grabbing at her waist.

Her face was smashed against a wall in the struggle that ensued, sending her crashing to the ground. The gang then kicked her as she lay motionless on the pavement.

When they finally relented and left her alone, Amy desperately called her mother, Wendy, and begged her to pick her up.

Speaking about the terrifying incident, Amy added: 'When I saw my blood, I thought it was going to be worse.

'They started to kick me. I burst into tears when I realised I was just going to have to take it.'

 After seeing her distraught daughter, Wendy called the police, and also took pictures of her injuries - now seen by around 3,000 people.

Wendy said: 'I had no idea that it would get the response it has.

'This shouldn't happen to anyone, never mind a young girl. She's 16, and as a parent you want to give her some independence, but I just don't feel like I can let her walk home now.

'The police haven't done anything other than take her coat away, and they're still doing DNA on that. They haven't found anything yet.'

'We're still waiting to hear back from them about the investigation but I just hope that they will be brought to justice, because this wasn't young lads, it was fully grown men.'  

The first is around 6ft 2in tall with a slim build. He wore an orange and yellow hooded top and black tracksuit bottoms with stripes on the lower half of the leg and white trainers.

The second man is also around 6ft 2in tall, with a slim build and was dressed in dark trousers and a hooded top with white trainers. 

The third is shorter with a slim build and was wearing a purple and blue hooded top and black Adidas bottoms with stripes down the leg.
