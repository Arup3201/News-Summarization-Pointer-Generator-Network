Atomic Kitten singer Jenny Frost - who is pregnant with twins - revealed today she was struck down by debilitating morning sickness, just like the Duchess of Cambridge.

The 34-year-old pop star and TV presenter, whose non-identical twin girls are due in February, said she spent the entire summer suffering from terrible sickness.

Jenny, who splits her time between Ibiza and the UK, said: 'I had to go to the doctor to try and get some medication to keep my food down.

Jenny Frost, who is expecting twins, has revealed today that she also suffered severe morning sickness during pregnancy

'When I was really sick, I couldn’t eat anything but salt and vinegar Squares crisps.

'I’m knackered... I’ve had my head stuck down the loo for most of this pregnancy - the morning sickness was debilitating.'

She told OK! magazine: 'The "glowing" stage has completely eluded me!'

When she announced the news in August, the singer wrote on Twitter: 'So tired,so pukey,so pregnant......so happy! x.'

Jenny took to Twitter to open up about the early stages of her pregnancy, telling fans she was 'so pukey'

She also added 'it's twins'- the pair are expected in February

Then added to the joy by telling her fans: 'Oh & it's twins!!!!! #arrrrrrrrrrrrgh.'

Jenny, who married Spanish scuba-diving school owner Vicente Juan Spiteri last year, already has a four-year-old son, Caspar, with her ex.

She was engaged to DJ Dominic Thrupp, but the pair split up after eight years together.

The Duchess of Cambridge is currently in hospital being treated for acute morning sickness.

While a royal source said the couple and 
their families are concerned about her illness, they have been 
'reassured' it is not a dangerous condition for either the the Duchess 
or her baby.

The couple delighted millions around the world – including their own families – with the happy news yesterday.

But as the word spread, the parents-to-be were together in hospital, facing the first hurdle in a much longed for pregnancy.

Kate,
30, who is barely eight weeks pregnant, was taken to the hospital just 
after lunch by her husband and immediately put on a drip to stop her 
becoming dehydrated.

Last night she appeared to be responding well to treatment. Sources said there was ‘no cause for alarm’.

However, doctors at the King Edward VII Hospital have taken the precautionary step of keeping her in for the next few days with Clarence House  telling MailOnline this morning that 
Catherine is still expected to spend the next few days in hospital, and 
requires a 'period of rest'.

Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) is a rare condition believed to affect up to two per cent of women in pregnancy and is a severe form of morning sickness.

It tends to be more common in young mothers, women who are in their first pregnancy, and those with multiple pregnancies.

Women with HG often lose weight - usually over 10 per cent of their body weight - and feel tired and dizzy.

They may also find they are passing water less often than usual, and the main risk is dehydration which can lead to headache, palpitations and confusion.

There is also a risk of nutritional deficiencies.

Then symptoms are severe, admission to hospital may be needed for observation and to treat dehydration with intravenous fluids.

This usually only means a few days in hospital.

Unlike most morning sickness, HG usually persists past the first trimester of pregnancy, and typically subsides by week 21 of pregnancy – although it can last much longer.

However, leading doctors say that along with more ordinary morning sickness, it is a sign the pregnancy is progressing.

Dr Peter Bowen-Simpkins, consultant obstetrician and medical director of the London Women’s Clinic, says: ‘It is almost always a positive sign that the pregnancy is progressing well.

‘The sickness is thought to be due to a rise in hormone levels. It normally occurs during weeks six and eight of pregnancy, when the placenta takes over production of hormones from the ovaries.

‘It generally continues until around 12 or 14 weeks, but if it stops before, it can — although not always — be a sign that all is not well.’
