Bathers on a New Zealand beach stripped naked and took to the Pacific Ocean in an attempt to shatter the record for the world's largest skinny dip.

Basking in the glow of a warm summer's day down-under, the 745 nude swimmers swarmed into the water on the coast of Gisborne in northeastern New Zealand.

The intrepid participants from across the country gathered as nature intended in the waves for what organisers hope will be a new Guinness World Record.

Good job it's not cold: The swimmers swarmed into the water on the coast of Gisborne in northeastern New Zealand

Footage and photos of the attempt will now be sent to Guinness World Records in order to obtain the official title.

Gisborne took the Guinness World Record for the largest skinny dip last year when 506 swimmers went for a naked dip, but the attempt was overshadowed by a nude horde of 729 on Playa El Playazo beach in Vera, Spainâ€š in July.

Footage and photos of the attempt will now be sent off to Guinness World Records to verify the title.

The current Guinness World Record for skinny dipping was set on July 21 in 2013 by 729 naked bathers on Playa El Playazo beach in Vera, Spain

'I couldn't believe there were so many people willing to get their kit off,' event organiser Dena Roberts told TVNZ.

'The image of 745 naked people in the ocean is something I definitely won't be forgetting for a while.'

The event was organised by New Zealand radio network, The Edge and the BW Summer Festival.
