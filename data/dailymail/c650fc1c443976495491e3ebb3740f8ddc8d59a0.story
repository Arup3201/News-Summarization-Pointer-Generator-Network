It was, claimed OK! USA, a 'dramatic delivery'. 'It's a girl for Kate!' screamed Life & Style, adding that the birth had been a 'last minute C-Section'.

Accompanied by photos of Prince William cradling a baby and crowds outside the Lindo Wing, the magazine promised details of 'family feuds' and claimed Prince George has already met his 'sister'. 

Unfortunately for the titles, their excitable announcement of the birth of the Duchess of Cambridge's second child has proved somewhat premature.

Still pregnant: Despite reports in US tabloids, the Duchess of Cambridge remains pregnant

The Duchess of Cambridge is perenially perfect. By this point, Kate Middleton has totally mastered the art of looking put-together and ladylike (as if she had any other choice!).

There's a reason why her outfits are endlessly replicated everywhere. Of course, being royalty has something to do with it, but apart from that, Kate has majorly enviable style so its understandable why so many people want to get a piece of it to call their own. As every pregnant woman knows, it's next to impossible to look chic and structured as your belly comes in, but Middleton pulls it off with ease!

The Duchess of Cambridge's coat is amazingly still available over at Beulah London for close to one grand. But as we all know, once word gets out about where to buy this jacket, it's sure to sell out super fast, so buy it while you still can! If you don't have the budget of a to-be-Princess, one of our picks in the edit below should fit the bill!

Asked to comment on the rumours and whether the Duchess has indeed had her second baby, a spokesman for Kensington Palace said, simply: 'She hasn't'.

Ridiculous though the latest round of American magazine covers are, this is not the first time US publications have run ludicrous stories about the Royal Family.

In 2012, The Globe claimed the Queen was dying and followed up with allegations of an 'evil plot' mounted by the Duchess of Cornwall to seize the throne.

Unsurprisingly, the Queen is still very much alive two years later and no such 'evil plot' has been uncovered. 

The Duchess of Cornwall is a frequent target of the tabloid, which regularly runs stories claiming she is trying to sabotage the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's relationship.

Target: The Duchess of Cornwall is regularly a target for bizarre claims in US tabloids

Allegations: One paper ran a story that claimed Charles is a cross-dresser jealous of his mother's clothes

Still alive: The Queen, pictured at an investiture ceremony yesterday, was said to be dying in 2012

It has also run specious stories about Prince Charles' alleged penchant for cross-dressing and included claims attributed to 'sources' that the Prince of Wales is jealous of his mother's wardrobe.

As a result, the tabloid alleged, the Duchess of Cambridge had been 'picked to be the next Queen' in place of Camilla.

Most of the paper's more ridiculous claims remain unpublished in the UK, with the Globe among the US tabloids to make their website inaccessible in Britain - a move designed to spare them the UK's stricter libel laws, requirement for accuracy and from the ire of regulating bodies such as IPSO.

The latest round of bizarre stories, which also include allegations that the royal family was kept out of the delivery room, are unlikely to trouble the Duchess herself, who revealed that her due date is in 'mid to late April' during an engagement on Wednesday.

She is also expected to join Prince William next week for a round of engagements in south London, among them a visit to the Stephen Lawrence Centre in Deptford.

The Centre, which was designed by architect David Adjaye OBE, is home to the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust and was set up in memory of Stephen, who was murdered by racist thugs in 1993.
