West Ham United manager Sam Allardyce believes a serious FA charge could have been potentially avoided had referee Mark Clattenburg handled better the powder-keg incident from last weekend's 2-1 defeat at Everton.

A strong tackle from Everton's James McCarthy on Morgan Amalfitano in the 40th minute, which was not initially penalised by Clattenburg last Saturday, prompted an angry reaction from several Hammers players.

A melee ensued and players from both Everton and West Ham started pushing each other. Republic of Ireland international McCarthy and West Ham defender Winston Reid were later booked for their parts in the first-half altercation.

Following the match, the Football Association charged both clubs for 'failing to ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion'. Everton and West Ham have until 6pm on Monday December 1 to respond to the charge.

Asked for his reaction to the FA charge, Allardyce said: 'I can't argue with (the FA Charge). We got so frustrated probably by the decision of the referee at the time.

'We lost our control a little bit. I don't condone what we did but I can understand why the frustration crept in.

'We have to try to control ourselves better in those situations because we could have easily lost a player to a red card in that congregation of players, prompted by the feeling of frustration that they felt at the time.

'To be fair to my players they don't often do that. Very rarely do they lose control, rarely have they done that sort of thing in my time here.'

Asked if the way Clattenburg handled the situation actually exacerbated the incident, Allardyce responded: 'I don't think it helped.

'Particularly the first one. If he gives a free-kick and deals with the situation straightaway, because of the bad tackle that had Morgan had suffered at that time.

'Because he didn't give a free-kick that spilled over into frustration. When you see your teammate is, what you feel, unfairly treated, then you want to stick up for each other.

'Obviously, you just don't want it to extend to levels that we saw last Saturday.'
