This was the miraculous scene as rescue workers plucked two people from their car after it crashed through a motorway bridge, leaving them hanging precariously in mid-air.

The driver and passenger of the car were 'extremely lucky' to escape following the dramatic accident on the M6 in Merseyside today.

The impact left the car's back wheels dangling off the side of the bridge, which crosses over the A580 carriageway below.

Rescue teams worked to lift the car, dangling precariously off the bridge which crosses the A580 below, cutting one motorist free and rescuing another. One is said to have suffered a leg injury

The accident happened in the southbound carriageway at Haylock shortly after 8.30am.

Rescue teams cut one person free from the wreckage before rescuing the other and then firefighters worked to lift the car back on to the road.

A spokesman for the Highways Agency said the rescue efforts took almost an hour, with the pair safely helped from the car by 9.45am.

Firefighter Chris Parrington, a member of the search and rescue team who attended the call-out, said: 'We were called to the flyover of the roundabout near junction 23 of the M6.

'When we arrived the back of the car was overhanging part of the East Lancashire Road, but the car was relatively stable and pretty level.

'We had to use winches and cables to secure the vehicle before the two occupants could be helped out.

'We had to use hydraulic cutters and a reciprocal saw to remove the door to release the driver.

'Both occupants of the car walked out assisted by firefighters and members of the North West Ambulance Serviceâ€™s Hazard Area Response Team.

'They were extremely lucky with a drop of more than 30 feet to the carriageway below.'

The North West Ambulance Service said one of the motorists suffered a leg injury. The pair were both taken to hospital for checks.

No other vehicles were involved.

The crash and subsequent rescue mission resulted in significant delays on the M6.

The Highways Agency spokesman said they were working to put a temporary concrete barrier in place to plug the gap left by the car.

He said: 'The rescue efforts took around an hour.

'The driver and passenger were rescued before firefighters then lifted the car back on to the road.

'We are putting a temporary barrier in place to stem the gap in the fence left by the car.

'As a result today we have only had one lane open past the crash scene for most of the day.

'Lane one and two and the hard shoulder have been closed while repairs are carried out.'

He said lanes one and two are expected to remain closed until 5pm.

'We will have to go back tomorrow morning to inspect the damage to allow us to plan for a permanent repair,' he added.

'But the motorway will reopen this evening once the temporary concrete blocks are in place.'
