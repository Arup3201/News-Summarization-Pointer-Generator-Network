One Australian has been airlifted to safety after being trapped in an avalanche in the Himalayas, which has so far reportedly claimed the lives of at least 29 people.

While fears continue to grow for more than a dozen Australian trekkers in Nepal, who are believed to be missing after the snowstorm swept the mountains on Tuesday, Nicole Wise was lucky to be found and rescued.

Her anxious boyfriend Bazil Plumb was 'stoked' once he received reports about Ms Wise.

However the death toll is expected to rise as search teams, hampered by bad weather, scour the snow and debris in the areas hit by the storms.

Sydney woman Nicole Wise was trekking in the area hit by the storm. Her boyfriend Bazil Plumb says he has been told Ms Wise has been rescued from the area

Ms Wise's partner Bazil Plumb, who's currently in Sydney, shared the good news on social media on Friday

Mr Plumb was anxiously waiting to hear back from his girlfriend after the avalanche earlier in the week

Mr Plumb, who has been waiting in Sydney to hear back from his girlfriend, shared the good news on social media on Friday.

'Just got word that Nikki is well and has been found and airlifted to safety out of the mountains!' he wrote.

'Was so hard to stay positive from the other side of the world and everyone who cared definitely helped me a lot.

'Stoked!'

Mr Plumb says he was overjoyed at the news. 

'I felt so relieved, I hadn't heard from anyone at all and was stressing so much,' he said. 

'I've been watching all these bodies and tourists on television: I've barely slept. I thought I lost my girl.'

Plumb says he has been contacting the Department of Foreign Affairs, numerous trekking companies and rescue crews and missing person lists.

While the news is uplifting, Mr Plumb's concerns remain as he is yet to hear from his partner.

'I can't get too excited as I haven't heard from her. I have taken the news with a grain of salt but it was awesome hearing news about her.'

Rescue members carry the dead bodies of trekkers from the Thorung La mountain pass in Nepal, which was hammered by severe snowstorms and avalanches

The storm has claimed the lives of at least 29 people, and that number is expected to rise as search teams scour the snow and debris in the areas hit by the storms

The severe storm was caused by the tail end of Cyclone Hudhud, which hammered southern India over the weekend.

Many of those who have died during the storm are foreigners.

A spokesperson for The Department of Foreign Affairs has told Daily Mail Australia 'the Australian Embassy in Kathmandu is in close and on-going contact with Nepalese authorities following the snow storm in the Annapurna region on Tuesday 14 October.'  

'Our Embassy is actively seeking information about the welfare and whereabouts of Australians possibly in the affected area. 

'Embassy staff remain ready to assist any Australians affected by this tragedy. Nepalese authorities continue to advise there are no reports of Australian casualties, so far.'

Among the missing Australians are Melbourne brothers David and John Hallford.

The Sydney Morning Herald has reported the pair had been trekking without a guide in the days leading up to the storm. 

The last post on John Hallford Facebook reads:

'Tomorrow we flight out to the Himalaya foothills, escape from our phones and start our long trek. Cya soon friends and family' 

Fears are also high for Nicole Wise, a Sydney woman who was trekking with a Sherpa in the area hit by the storm. 

A New Zealand national, Lisa Walton, and her British partner Lizi Hamer were found safe on Saturday. 

Anyone with concerns for the welfare of family and friends in NepalI should call the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on (02) 6261-3305 or within Australia on 1300 555 135 (local call cost).'
