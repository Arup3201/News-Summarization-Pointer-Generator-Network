Two Italian air force fighter jets have collided during a training mission - narrowly missing a village in eastern Italy.

It isn't known whether the two pilots and two navigators managed to eject from the Tornado jets, and are now missing after the crafts crashed into a hilly, wooded area, near Ascoli.

Witnesses reported seeing a fireball as the jets collided and erupted in flames. An air search is now being conducted for the missing crew, the air force said.

This is the moment two Italian air force fighter jets collided during a training mission - narrowly missing a village in eastern Italy

The crash in a wooded area near the town of Ascoli Piceno in the Marche region sparked a forest fire. The Tg1 television footage showed flames and columns of billowing smoke at the scene

The pilots are presumed to have ejected before the collision - which sparked this forest fire - and survived, Ansa reported, although they have not yet been found and witnesses said they had not seen any parachutes deployed

A
 Civil Protection official, Susanna Balducci, told Sky TG24 TV there 
were no civilian casualties on the ground after the crash in woods near 
the town of Ascoli.

A witness told Sky Italia television he saw 'an enormous ball of fire that lasted about five seconds, and then (the planes) crashed into the hillside'.

Balducci said a firefighting helicopter was trying to extinguish the blaze, whose flames and dark smoke were visible for miles. 

On the ground, firefighters battled various blazes in the wooded hills overlooking the Marche town of Ascoli Piceno, as the flames drew closer to the village of Casa Murana
