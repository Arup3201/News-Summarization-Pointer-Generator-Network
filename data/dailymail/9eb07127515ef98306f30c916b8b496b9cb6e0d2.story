Habitable super-Earths - that have up to five times the mass of our own planet - could possess vast, long-lasting oceans. 

Oceans cover more than two thirds of the Earth's surface and are continually replenished by volcanic activity dragging up water buried deep underground.

And now a new study indicates that habitable zone planets may be even better at establishing and maintaining these large bodies of water.

Researchers from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics believe that habitable super-Earths with up to five times the mass of our own planet, could hold vast oceans. This image shows an artist's impression of a gas giant planet rising over the horizon of an alien waterworld

A planet occupying a star's habitable zone is in an orbit where temperatures are mild enough to allow the existence of liquid surface water, making lakes, rivers and oceans possible.

Most scientists agree that liquid water is needed for the development of life as we know it.

Dr Laura Schaefer, from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who led the study said: 'When people consider whether a planet is in the habitable zone, they think about its distance from the star and its temperature.

Computer simulations  recently revealed the vital role oceans play in moderating climate.

Without large expanses of water on a planet’s surface, seasonal temperature rises would be too rapid and weather too extreme to provide a comfortable home for life.

Even a planet in the habitable zone of its star - the orbital region where temperatures are mild enough to permit liquid surface water - is likely to be sterile and lifeless without oceans.

In our own solar system, barren Mars has no oceans despite being in the sun’s habitable zone, the researchers point out. 

As a result, its air temperature swings over a range of 100°C.

Factoring oceans into climate models was vital to knowing whether a planet could develop and sustain life, said the researchers from the University of East Anglia’s School of Maths.

'However, they should also think about oceans, and look at super-Earths to find a good sailing or surfing destination.'

Studies have shown that the Earth's mantle holds several oceans' worth of water that has been pulled underground by the movements of tectonic plates and sinking ocean floors.

Without water being brought back to the surface by volcanism, the oceans would soon disappear.

Dr Schaefer's team used computer simulations to verify that the same recycling process that keeps the Earth's ocean basins filled with water also takes place on super-Earths.

In fact, oceans were even more likely to be found on planets having two to four times the mass of the Earth. 

Super-Earth oceans also persisted for a very long time - at least 10 billion years, assuming they were not boiled away by a swelling 'red giant' star near the end of its life.

The largest planet studied, with five times the Earth's mass, did not develop oceans for around a billion years due to its thicker crust.

'This suggests that if you want to look for life, you should look at older super-Earths,' said Dr Schaefer.

Experts used simulations to verify if the same recycling of water process happens on super-Earths. They found oceans were more likely to be found on planets having two to four times the mass of the Earth (artist's impression pictured). Most scientists agree liquid water is needed for the development of life

Complex life was most likely to be found on super-Earth planets about 5.5 billion years old, around a billion years older than the Earth, said the scientists.

Scientists have so far confirmed the existence of more than 1,739 planets outside our solar system, according to information from the Nasa Exoplanet Archive.

There are thousands more unconfirmed 'candidates', and a total of 452 multiple planet systems have also been logged.

The findings were presented at the American Astronomical Society annual meeting in Washington DC.
