After displays to please the eye this season, Middlesbrough displayed their determined side to rescue a draw with 10 men and ascent to the summit of the Championship.

Patrick Bamford scored with 17 minutes left to edge Aitor Karanka's side a point ahead of Bournemouth and Derby County.

A day after Birmingham's parent company brought in receivers to control affairs, it looked like the team would produce a positive response, courtesy of a Paul Caddis penalty that also saw Boro goalkeeper Dimitrios Konstantopoulos sent off.

But, perhaps hesistant after six games without a win, they failed to press their numerical advantage and the visitors finished the contest the better team.

Bamford struck his 12th goal of the season with a finish through the legs of Darren Randolph, following a one-two with Grant Leadbitter to unlock Birmingham's defence. 'The mighty Boro, we're going up,' the travelling fans chanted. Who can blame their optimism after nine league matches without defeat.

Gary Rowett's team had gone ahead thanks to a terribly underhit backpass from Ben Gibson in the 42nd minute. Clayton Donaldson seized onto the ball ahead of Konstantopoulos, touching it into space, only to be brought down by the diving Boro goalkeeper.

Referee David Coote was some distance away but pointed to the spot without hesitation, producing he red card soon after. The incident bore echoes of Wayne Rooney's penalty against Preston but Konstantopoulos remaining on the ground injured illustrated contact had been made here.

There may have been an element of gamesmanship as the 36-year-old Greek took his time to walk from the field with Tomas Mejias coming on, but it proved fruitless. Three minutes after the initial award Caddis dispatched from 12 yards with zero fuss.

Tensions on the touchline had been bubbling away, with Rowett and Karanka exchanging words and jabbed fingers at one stage, but little argument was made over this key decision.

It had been an even contest to that point, Birmingham shading the attacking moments thanks to the deadball delivery of David Cotterill and the pace of Demarai Gray.

Andrew Shinnie struck a fine shot from range that required a good save, while Jonathan Spector was denied by a desperate block from Gibson.

The visitors, naming seven of the same starting XI who began Sunday's FA Cup defeat top Asrenal, could have taken the lead as early as the third minute.

Adam Forshaw burst through in midfield and released Emilio Nsue in the area, but the Boro winger sent his shot just wide of the far post.

Karanka's side actually improved a man down, Jelle Vossen the player making way, and thought they had levelled when substitute Albert Adomah placed the ball in the net. But the offside flag had been raised.

Karanka's crew wanted a penalty when Bamford fell under pressure from Paul Robinson but Coote was unmoved and bemused fourth official Graham Scott was left to count the six backroom staffers who had stood up to appeal.

Given the circumstances, they will be happy to leave the Second City in first position – doubly so when they saw Donaldson somehow plant his header from a Caddis cross over the bar in added time.
