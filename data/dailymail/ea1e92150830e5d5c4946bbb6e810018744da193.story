Virtual reality has so far been the domain of video games and rollercoasters.

However, Samsung has revealed a revolutionary 360 camera is claims could revolutionise the way we communicate by allowing us enter a real time virtual world anywhere the camera is set up.

The system will work with its wireless Gear VR system, which is set to go on sale in December.

It offers full 3D reconstruction in all directions, using stereo camera pairs combined with a top-view camera to capture independent left and right eye stereo pairs.

Project Beyond uses patent-pending stereoscopic interleaved capture and 3D-aware stitching technology to capture the scene just like the human eye, but in a form factor that is extremely compact and can be set up anywhere.

Samsung plans to use the device to capture events and places around the world for [purchasers of its Gear VR  system.

'Teleport to the places and events you always wanted to see. Be anywhere,' it said.

'Today we offer a sneak preview of Project Beyond,the world’s first true 3D 360˚ omniview camera,' Think Tank, Samsung's Us research arm, said.

'Beyond captures and streams immersive videos in stunning high-resolution 3D, and

allows every user to enjoy their viewing experience in the way they see fit.

Samsung's $200 Gear VR headset is needed to view the images - along with a Note 4 tablet

The camera system can stream real time events, as well as store the data for future viewing.

The innovative reconstruction system recreates the view geometry in the same way that

the human eyes see, producing unparalleled 3D perception.

Project Beyond is not a product, but one of the many exciting projects currently being developed

by the Think Tank Team, an advanced research team within Samsung Research America. 

'This is the first operational version of the device, and just a taste of what the final system we are working on will be capable of,' it said

The Samsung Gear VR uses the  5.7 inch Quad HD Super AMOLED display of a Galaxy Note 4.

This is mounted in a specially designed headset with also includes basic head tracking capabilities.

Users do not need to connect the gadget to a power supply of computer, as with other VR headsets. 

Samsung's VR headset will go on sale this year, and was developed with Facebook's Oculus.

'Once complete, we hope to deploy Project Beyond around the world to beautiful and noteworthy locations and events, and allow users to experience those locations as if they were really there. 

'The camera system can stream real time events, as well as store the data for future viewing.

'Although we won’t have the camera for sale immediately, the content generated from Project

Beyond will be available to every Gear VR user immediately. 

The system uses 16 HD cameras and a range of computer kit to capture and stream the VR images

It offers full 3D reconstruction in all directions, using stereo camera pairs combined with a top-view camera to capture independent left and right eye stereo pairs.

'This way, you will not have to wait to teleport around the world with your Gear VR. 

'With Project Beyond, the Gear VR will become a gateway to an ever-increasing pool of content that allows users to instantly teleport to places and events they always wanted to see. 

'It frees the users of Gear VR from the limitations and rigors of physical travel, while providing a realistic experience that brings the nuances of an environment to the comfort of the living room.'
