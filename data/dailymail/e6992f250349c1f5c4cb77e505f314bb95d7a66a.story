Banks claim Zapp payment technology will be safer than using a debit card

UK shoppers will soon be able leave their wallets at home thanks to a new app that will allow them to pay with their smartphones.

HSBC, First Direct, Nationwide, Santander and Metro Bank have announced that they will offer Zapp mobile payments to 18 million customers across the UK.

Together, this group represents over a third of all UK bank accounts with 60 per cent of the country’s businesses able to take advantage of the service.

Zapp will be integrated onto a mobile banking application. The customers will be able to see their balances on each account, and choose which one to pay from.

When customers reach the checkout of a shop that accepts Zapp payments, they will have a special code sent to their mobile phone.

Alternatively, customers will be able to scan a code into the handset from a bill in a restaurant or the screen on a card machine.

The code will contain all the information about the transaction including the price, the retailer's details and information about the items being purchased. These will appear on the customer's mobile screen.

Once a customer has then logged into the mobile banking app they will then confirm or reject the transaction with a tap of the finger. Zapp claims the whole process will take about 12 seconds.

The payments work through something known as ‘digital tokens’ which means customers can keep their financial details private.

Banks claim the technology will be safer 
than using a debit card, as the unique code for that purchase will 
expire after three minutes.

Unlike
 chip and pin cards, Zapp will never hand over sensitive information, 
such as card numbers and expiry dates.

As well as this, only retailers signed up to the scheme will be able to generate the codes.

Unlike chip and pin cards, Zapp doesn't hand over sensitive information, such as card numbers and expiry dates, that can be used by criminals to commit fraud.

As well as this, only retailers signed up to the scheme will be able to generate the codes.

‘When you pay with a card in a shop or online, you give the merchant all sorts of details that would be dangerous in the hands of a fraudster,’ said Peter Keenan, Zapp’s chief executive.

‘With Zapp, nothing is revealed, so it’s much more secure.’

The Centre for Economic and Business Research estimates that 20 million people will use their mobiles to pay for goods and services by the end of the decade.

However, experts haven’t ruled out safety fears. During Zapp’s development last year, Justin Modray, of finance website Candid Money, said: ‘Paying by smartphone obviously appeals to some and is growing in popularity.

‘However, it remains to be seen whether this throws up any major security issues.

‘The new technology will have to be extremely fool-proof or it will cause more problems than it solves.’

A number of similar digital wallets are already being used by customer, including PayPal’s app and SumUp Pay.

Both have designed a ‘frictionless’ payment experience, whereby customers can pay by speaking their name rather than fumbling for a wallet or phone.

It works when a customer links their card details to an app and then authorises which companies are allowed to charge them directly.

When the customers collects a coffee or sandwich from a shop, their presence and photograph will be visible on the merchant’s own computer. They need only say their name when paying and the sum can be deducted from their account.
