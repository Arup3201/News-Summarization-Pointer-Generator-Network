She is the half-naked cavorting star of Robin Thicke's steamy Blurred Lines video.

And while the uncensored video may have reportedly been banned from YouTube, Emily Ratajkowski is still cashing in.

The American model and actress has seen her star rocket since being cast alongside two other semi-clad models in the video for the song featuring rappers T.I. and Pharrell.

And now she has stripped off again as the star of GQ magazine's July/August 2013 issue, in a shoot by acclaimed celebrity photographer Tony Kelly, who has snapped the likes of Justin Bieber, Kate Upton and Bruno Mars.

While the 21-year-old model left her pants on for Robin Thicke's video, she has dared to bare all for the iconic men's magazine.

In one of the shots that we can publish the London-born model can be seen carrying a bunch of balloons and concealing her modesty with just one arm.

In another she poses in a giant 
cocktail glass in a revealing pair of black underwear with a bottle of 
champagne and sky-high stilettos.

Big break: Emily was the almost naked star of Robin Thicke's music video for Blurred Lines, which was blocked from YouTube for being too racyÂ

Emily,
 who grew up in California, was signed by Ford Models at the tender age 
of 14 but continued to attend high school in San Diego as she modeled 
and acted in Los Angeles.

She has starred in campaigns for the likes of Forever 21, Nordstrom, and various swimwear and lingerie clients.

Her big break came when she was shot 
by industry legend Tony Duran.

After that, she began to be recognised as
 a fashion model and shot more and more fashion editorials, including 
gracing the cover of GQ Turkey.

But she really caught the world's attention as the star of Thicke's video, which was released in 
March. The uncensored version was released a few days later and garnered more than 1 million views in days before being banned by YouTube.

Thicke said in an interview that he had sought the approval of his wife, actress Paula Patton, to shoot with nude models.

'Obviously if she didn't like it, I wouldn't put it out,' he said.

The 36-year-old singer said director Diane Martel came up with the idea of using nude models.

'As long as it's fun and the girls are comfortable, let's do something silly,' Thicke said. 'Let's take some chances.'

And it looks like taking a chance certainly paid off for Emily.
