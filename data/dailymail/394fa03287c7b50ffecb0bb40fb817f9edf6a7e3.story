Hitting back: Mohammed Mattar plans to sue the Home Office after he spent two years awaiting trial

An imam accused of conducting almost 600 sham marriages plans to the government for putting him through 'two years of hell' after a Home Office blunder forced prosecutors to drop charges.

Mohammed Mattar demanded a personal apology from UK Border Agency chiefs today for 'making a mug' of him after the case against the 62-year-old collapsed.

The Egyptian-born bookseller said investigators searched 'every last inch' of his home and an Islamic bookshop he ran in Bayswater, west London, which has since shut down.

He said at his home in Kilburn, north west London: 'This has been going on for over two years - it’s been hell. I’m discussing what action I am take with my lawyers.

'This has upset my family greatly, it has affected me psychologically, my wife has been left worried that the police will come to the house every day.

'I’m glad my name has now been cleared.'

Mr Mattar's was the second sham marriage case to be catastrophically bungled by Home Office officials in a week when it was revealed yesterday.

Days earlier, ministers were left red-faced over the collapse of Britain’s biggest sham marriage case against a vicar amid allegations of serious misconduct by border officials.

A judge ordered charges against father-of-six Mr Mattar to be dropped last month after prosecutors accused the Home Office of not preparing evidence in time.

That meant it could not hand over the evidence to Mr Mattar's defence solicitors, as required by the law. A judge refused prosecutors' bid to extend the time limit.

Police first raided Mr Mattar's home and the Dar Al Dawa Islamic centre on July 11, 2012.

'They went though all our private possessions,' Mr Mattar said. 'They broke into anything like a suitcase or drawer that they couldn’t open.

'When they couldn’t find anything here they went to the centre and searched through everything, even in the books like they were going to find something.'

Mr Mattar, who became an imam in the 1970s, openly admitted he had carried out Islamic marriages for just £100 a time - but insisted they were completely legal.

'We carried out up to three marriages a month,' he said. 'It was a small part of our business. We had all nationalities of Muslim, British, Pakistani, Malaysian.

'They were for people who wanted to be married under Islamic law. We made sure they had all of their identification and everything was legal.

'Once we had the ceremony they went to the council and registered it there. We have never broken the law, it was a big mistake.'

Mr Mattar’s son, Ismail, is a serving officer in the Metropolitan Police. 

He added: 'I’m not interested in breaking any laws, I have lived here for most of my life, my children have grown up here, we respect this country and its rules.

'We did everything by the law, we had all the right certification, we had all the inspections and regulation, I can not see why this happened.'

He added: 'I’m now trying to rebuild my life and, hopefully, start the business again in a new place.'

A massive investigation into Mr Mattar, who was accused of conducting the weddings between 2008 and 2012, was launched two years ago costing tens of thousands of pounds.

He was also charged with concealing criminal property via money transfers to the value of £1,887,262, contrary to the Proceeds of Crime Act. This charge was dropped in April.

Yesterday prosecutors made clear Home Office blunders were to blame. A CPS spokesman said: ‘In early 2014 we identified a large amount of potentially relevant material and we advised the Home Office investigation team to obtain and look into the material for the purpose of disclosure.

‘In August it became apparent that this work had not been completed and therefore we would not be able to fully discharge disclosure obligations in the case before the trial.

'We therefore applied for an adjournment. This was refused by the court and we had no option but to offer no evidence.’

A Home Office spokesman said there were ‘lessons to be learned’ to prevent something similar happening again.

He added: ‘The decision not to take this matter to trial is disappointing, particularly after such a long investigation.’

Yesterday a damning report by MPs on the Public Accounts Committee slammed growing asylum backlogs, ‘lost’ illegal immigrants and the write-off of some £1billion of taxpayers’ money on failed IT projects.

A series of damaging revelations prompted the leaders of both major parties to each demand the other apologise for their handling of the immigration system.

At Prime Minister’s Questions Ed Miliband accused David Cameron of making the system worse, while the PM hit back over the ‘shambles’ he inherited from Labour. 

It follows the collapse of the £1million trial of a vicar suspected of running Britain’s biggest sham marriage racket, due to ‘serious misconduct’ by Border Agency staff.

Last week charges were dropped against Reverend Nathan Ntege, 54, who was accused of overseeing a ‘matrimonial conveyor belt’ of Eastern European brides.

The Uganda-born clergyman walked free after Judge Nic Madge accused two Border Agency officials of perjury and perverting the course of justice.

They have both been suspended and may face criminal charges themselves.
