A two-year-old boy was found locked in an abandoned car with a crack pipe and a juice bottle containing alcohol in Michigan.

Deputies found the boy sleeping in a car with a freshly damaged front end in Pontiac in the early hours of Saturday morning.

The officers were able to open the car and called an ambulance crew to check the little boy â€“ who was determined to be in good health.

Authorities in southeast Michigan say they found a two-year-old boy sleeping in a locked vehicle with this crack pipe and a juice bottle containing alcohol inside

'They tried to wake the child. The child wouldn't respond. So, they gained access using lockout tools. Checked on the child. Called EMS. Had the EMS come over and check the stats and vitals of the child. The child was determined to be in fine shape but very, very tired,' Sheriff Michael Bouchard told ClickOnDetroit.com.

Not long after the boy's 49-year-old aunt arrived on the scene and told police that she had been in the car with the child's 44-year-old mother.

The woman told police that the child's mother had left the scene in search of drugs, while she had left to find gas as the car had run out.

The woman was taken into custody and both she and the child were taken to the Oakland County Sheriff's Office's Pontiac Substation.

Children's Protective Services have since turned the child over to his father.

The aunt was questioned and released pending possible charges.

Police are seeking warrants for the child's mother, who has not yet been located.

The car was abandoned in the area of Orchard Lake and S. Johnson Street in Pontiac
