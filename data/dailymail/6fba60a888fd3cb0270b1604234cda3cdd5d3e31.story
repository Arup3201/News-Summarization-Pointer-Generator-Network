Dozens of Iraqi terrorists who targeted U.S. troops could be living off government benefits on U.S. soil after they were allowed into the country as 'war refugees,' it has been revealed.

The terrorism arrests of two Iraqis in Kentucky in May 2011 convinced federal authorities that some of the refugees who moved to the United States had fought against the U.S. in the Iraq War - and still wanted to kill Americans. 

FBI agents are now working around the clock to dust every insurgent bomb 
recovered in Iraq for fingerprints to check them against the database of 
70,000 Iraqi refugees who settled here.

Gregory Carl, director of the FBI's Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center, told ABC News that his lab has identified 'dozens' of Iraqi refugees whose fingerprints potentially match the prints found on IEDs.

'I wouldn't be surprised if there were many more than that. And these are trained terrorists in the art of bombmaking that are inside the United States,'  Congressman Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, told ABC.

'And quite frankly, from a homeland security perspective, that really concerns me.'

The Kentucky case of Waad Ramadan Alwan, 32 and Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, 26, taught the FBI that Iraqi terrorists had been settled in the United States - despite both men having had documented run-ins with Americans forces in Iraq.

Alwan and Hammadi both bragged during a federal sting that they had fought against American soldiers.

As part of the investigation, they were caught on video handling heavy weapons like machine guns and rocket launchers.

Both men had also been arrested and fingerprinted in Iraq by American soldiers, ABC reports.

Despite this - a background check to let them in the country came back 'clean.'

When the men were arrested they were living in public housing and collecting government assistance checks in Bowling Green, Kentucky.

Alwan boasted that he'd built at least a dozen bombs in Iraq and had killed U.S. troops with a sniper rifle - claiming that he 'had them for lunch and dinner.'

In 2012, nearly a year after the FBI arrested the two suspects after working with an undercover informant to ship dummy weapons to al-Qaeda fighters in Iraq, the  Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center discovered Alwan's fingerprints on a bomb recovered in Iraq in 2005.

The print was on a cordless phone base station that had been attached to 'three homemade-explosive artillery rounds concealed by gravel with protruding wires' that U.S. troops had discovered in Bayji on a patrol.

Alwan had drawn a model for a similar explosive for the undercover informant.

He even had talked about tracking down a U.S. Army officer who had given Alwan trouble when he was fighting the Americans in Iraq.
