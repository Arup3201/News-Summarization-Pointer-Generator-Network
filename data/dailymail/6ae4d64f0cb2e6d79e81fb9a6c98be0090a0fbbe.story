They wanted to turn New York’s financial district into an ‘American Tahrir Square’ by protesting against what they claim is the greed and corruption of the richest people in the U.S.

More than 1,000 protesters gathered in Manhattan for the demonstrations, but they were thwarted by police who put Wall Street on lockdown after learning about the plans through social media.

It was on a much smaller scale than the 20,000 people organisers Adbusters, an online magazine, had wanted to see when they launched the occupation idea in July.

Protesters organised the rally under the hash-tag of #OccupyWallStreet on Twitter and Facebook, but police spotted this and shut down Wall Street near the Stock Exchange and Federal Hall.

‘The one thing we all have in common is that we are the 99 per cent that will no longer tolerate the greed and corruption of the one per cent,’ a statement on the website Occupy Wall Street said.

Hundreds of people had gathered near Wall Street with backpacks and sleeping bags to search for a place to camp, but police were there to keep them away from the main financial area.

The protesters instead headed for Trinity Place, which is only around 1,000ft from Wall Street. Police put barricades around the famous bull statue on Broadway.

‘This is a protest against corporate greed and we come to Wall Street because Wall Street is the Ground Zero for corporate greed,’ Julia River Hitt, a 22-year-old philosophy student, told AFP.

The demonstrators were hoping their protests would turn into the U.S. version of the square in Cairo that become world famous in its role of ousting Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in February.

Protester signs read ‘no more corruption’ and ‘Wall St Greed, New Yorkers Say Enough’. Many were fuelled by a free food station with jars of peanut butter, reported MSNBC.

Spanish law professor Javier Dorado said the protests reminded him of what was going on back in his own country - where people are unhappy about unemployment and alleged corruption.

'This is a global phenomenon that is taking place in Europe and many countries,’ he told AFP.

One masked protester said he was annoyed about U.S. involvement in wars in Libya, Afghanistan and Iraq, when there are cuts in education and social spending.

He said: ‘We know where the money is going! Revolution in America!’

Big messages: People are angry about the inability of the U.S. to break out of an economic crisis

Slogan: Hundreds of people had gathered near Wall Street with backpacks and sleeping bags

People are angry about the inability of the U.S. to break out of an economic crisis that has seen cuts in public services while unemployment stays above the nine per cent mark.

‘A protest area was established on Broad Street at Exchange Street, next to the Stock Exchange, but protesters elected not to use it,’ a police spokesman told The New York Times.

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg told protesters on Friday he is happy for them to use their right to demonstrate as long as this does not infringe anybody else's rights.
