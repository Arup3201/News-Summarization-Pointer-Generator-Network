Emyr Davies, pictured, advertised filthy rooms as 'newly-refurbished' but claimed he didn't understand what the phrase meant

Peeling wallpaper, mouldy bathrooms and tatty floors don’t sound the most inviting attributes for a seaside hotel.

So owner Emyr Davies advertised his Four Seasons establishment as being ‘newly refurbished’ instead.

He flaunted a few fake star ratings and tourist board accreditations for good measure.

But his somewhat imaginative approach to marketing landed him in court after a flood of complaints from visitors about the three hotels he owns in Aberystwyth, West Wales.

Last week Davies was ordered to pay almost £12,000 in fines, costs and compensation after admitting  12 charges of unfair trading under consumer protection legislation.

Aberystwyth magistrates heard some guests who had booked the Four Seasons found themselves shunted off to other accommodation because Davies had double- booked their rooms.

They ended up in his wife’s bedroom, still filled with her personal belongings, or in lower-graded rooms in other hotels. 

Those who got to stay at the Four Seasons itself, however, were even unhappier. In a litany of complaints on travel websites, they told of filthy rooms, grubby vinyl flooring and mouldy walls.

Davies, 40, claimed that he didn’t understand what ‘newly refurbished’ meant because his first  language is Welsh.

Run down: The bathroom in the Queensbridge was shabby and the court heard how one guest found her 'newly refurbished' room at the Four Seasons to be 'filthy' (pictured right)

Another guest at the Queensbridge Hotel, also owned by Davies, said their room was covered in mould, whilst another one dubbed the hotel a 'dated hovel' and an 'overpriced dive'

Maggie Hughes, prosecuting for 
Ceredigion council, said tourism body Visit Wales had revoked the star 
ratings for Davies’s hotels after a series of complaints, but he refused
to remove them from signs outside or on his website.

He also boasted accreditation from the AA, which has not recognised the hotels for some time.

At the Four Seasons signs indicated it
held a two-star AA rating, as well as three stars from the Welsh 
Tourist Board. Rooms cost about £90. Davies, who also owns Belgrave 
House and the Queensbridge hotels, was told by magistrates that he had 
degraded the local tourist industry and badly let down his guests.

They fined him £8,400 and ordered him 
to pay £3,000 in costs to Ceredigion council. He will also have to pay 
£550 compensation to guests who were misled about bookings.  Councillor 
Dafydd Edward said the council had prosecuted as a last resort after 
Davies ignored warnings.

Simon Margrave-Jones, Davies’s 
solicitor, told the Mail his client had made significant improvements to
the hotels over the past 24 months.  He added: ‘Mr Davies regrets any 
distress or inconvenience caused to his guests.’

Of the 60 entries on the TripAdvisor website, 26 rated Davies’ Four Seasons hotel as 'terrible'.1. 'Fawlty Towers' - Four Seasons

Some guests claimed that a staff member at the Four Seasons hotel was a 'real-life Basil Fawlty', pictured

'Breakfast waiter needs a kick up the backside. Had to ask him twice on both mornings for tea, toast and orange juice. Then the food took along (sic) time to arrive. Could have killed the pig myself and cooked it quicker.'

2. 'Don’t Go There' - Four Seasons'The room was a hole. Threadbare carpets, and not the cleanest. I will definately (sic) be recommending this hotel to my worst enemies.'

3. 'AWFUL' - Queensbridge Hotel'The ‘receptionist’ could only be described as Basil Fawlty. When asked if we could have a television in the room he gave me a key to a top floor room and told me to get it myself...needless to say I will not be paying a return visit.'

4. 'Overpriced dump' - The Belgrave'We stayed at Belgrave a year ago for the christening of our granddaughter, but have only just calmed down enough to be able to rationalize our experience.'

5. 'Shed central' - Four Seasons'The most uncomfortable bed I can remember (trying) to sleep in. We had a freezing cold bathroom. Toilet and a grubby old bath I’d only consider to die in, not wash.'

6. 'Avoid!' - Four Seasons'OMG where to start? Looks adequate from outside and reception but room was hideous - grubby and too small to swing a hamster, let alone a cat.'

7. 'Shocking ‘hotel’'- The Belgrave'Room was just terrible! The smell was overwhelming air freshner (sic)! What was it covering up? The carpet hadn’t been vacuumed for days BUT the bathroom!!!!!!! AAAAGGHHHH! It was filthy!'

8. 'Avoid.' - Four Season'If your only other option was to sleep on the street then perhaps risk it.'

9. 'Complete dump - will look great when its (sic) demolished' - The Belgrave'Room sizes were terrible - I’ve slept in bigger one man tents and the hotel had more cracks in it than my crazy paving.'

10. 'ARGH!' - Four Seasons'Stupidly, I ignored the bad reviews below!'
