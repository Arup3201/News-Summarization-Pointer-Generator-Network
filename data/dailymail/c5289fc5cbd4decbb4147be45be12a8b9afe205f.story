Stars like Andre Schurrle helped Chelsea earn almost £800,000 from the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

The Premier League's traditional top-four powers have all netted seven-figure sums from last summer's tournament in Brazil.

Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal and Manchester City received the hefty payments from FIFA in recognition of their top players' exploits at world game's showpiece event.

Stamford Bridge midfielder Schurrle helped Germany go all the way to the title in South America, boosting the Blues' FIFA payment in return.

Governing body FIFA has distributed £46.3million to clubs across the globe, with each outfit rewarded for the number of players who attended the World Cup.

Bayern Munich received the world's highest club payment, of £1.1m owing in part to Germany claiming the crown.

The European Club Association (ECA) was integral in setting up the payments scheme that started for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.

'The ECA is pleased to announce that 396 clubs affiliated to 57 different national associations from around the globe will receive a share of the benefits from the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil,' read a statement released by the club body.

FIFA determined each club's payment by starting with a set fee of £1,850 per player per day spent at the 2014 tournament.

Spanish giants Real Madrid were also among those receiving seven figures, recouping £860,000 for their World Cup contingent.

Chelsea recouped £793,000 ($1.2m), the highest figure for any Premier League side.
