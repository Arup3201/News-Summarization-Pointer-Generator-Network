Attack: Dr Mark Alner has been convicted of assaulting a police officer for the third time

A doctor was today spared jail after he drunkenly attacked a policeman - despite having been convicted of similar offences twice before.

Mark Alner, a consultant radiologist at a hospital, kicked PC Rob Hoskins in the head while he was being arrested for refusing to take a breath test during a traffic stop.

The 49-year-old, who has been struck off by the GMC, had previously been handed a conditional discharge after being convicted of two offences of assaulting a police officer.

Nonetheless, Alner walked free from Bournemouth Magistrates' Court after the latest attack and was ordered to pay his victim just £150 in compensation, prompting fury from police leaders.

Clive Chamberlain, the chairman of Dorset Police Federation, said: 'How many times does somebody have to assault a police officer for them to be sent to prison?

'There needs to be a strong sentencing deterrent so that people think twice before they hit a public servant like a police officer, fireman or ambulance paramedic, going about their job.

'I am shocked at the lack of sentence. The money is irrelevant to the officer involved. In any case, what is £150 to a doctor who I'm sure earns a good wage?'

Alner, from Lytchett Minster in Dorset, was being sentenced not only for assaulting PC Hoskins but also attacking a train driver in a separate incident.

Heather Jackson, prosecuting, told the court that the doctor lost his temper with rail staff at Poole after missing his stop in July 2011.

He was 'ranting and raving and swearing' and started banging on the train, and when the train driver asked him to stop Alner hit him, she said.

The incident involving PC Hoskins came in May last year, when the officer stopped him as he was driving his Vauxhall Zafira in Weymouth.

Another policeman noticed Alner was 'unsteady on his feet' and had an open can of cider in car, so asked him to provide a breath test, Ms Jackson said.

The doctor refused and lost his temper, she told the court, adding: 'He struggled with officers and was swearing and aggressive. He began kicking out with his feet.'

PC Hoskins said: 'I tried to grab him by his legs to control them, and the male kicked me in the right side of my face.'

Alner has since lost his job at the Dorset County Hospital in Dorchester and been struck off by the General Medical Council..

He admitted charges of assault by beating in relation to the train driver, assaulting a constable in the execution of his duty and failing to provide a specimen of breath.

Jonathan Morrissey said in mitigation that his client had been badly affected by recent personal problems and was now attending Alcoholics Anonymous.

District judge Roger House accepted that Alner had had 'more than his fair share of major difficulties' as he ordered him to pay £150 compensation and £170 in court costs and banned him from driving for three years.
