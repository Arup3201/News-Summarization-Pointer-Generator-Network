Newcastle strolled to a 4-0 victory against Sydney FC on Tuesday as Alan Pardew's new signings were given the chance to impress in New Zealand.

Siem de Jong gave the Magpies an early lead as the Dutchman pounced on a mistake from Sydney goalkeeper Ivan Necevski to rob him of the ball before slotting home for his second pre-season goal of the summer.

Shortly afterwards, Newcastle new boy Emmanuel Riviere scored on his non-competitive Newcastle debut after putting the finishing touch to a Yoan Gouffran cross.

Newcastle defender Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa even fancied his chances as the right-back let rip from 20-yards to find the net courtesy of a fairly hefty deflection.

It was a good workout for Alan Pardew's side in the chill of Dunedin as Sydney began to put up more of a fight in the second half while the string of substitutes took the flow out of the game.

It took until the 82nd minute for Newcastle to grab their fourth when substitute Adam Armstrong slotted past the Sydney goalkeeper.

Ahead of the kick-off, both teams took part in a touching tribute to the two Newcastle fans that sadly lost their lives on the Malaysia Airlines flight MH17.

Alan Pardew and Fabricio Coloccini placed two wreaths onto two empty seats with messages that read: 'With love from all at NUFC'.

Both sets of teams also took part in a moment of silence before the game.Â
