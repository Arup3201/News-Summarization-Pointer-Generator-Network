Saturday's battering of Arsenal has put Chelsea firmly in charge of the title race and, with Jose Mourinho in the driving seat, they have the perfect man to get them over the line.

Mourinho has won league titles at every club he has managed, so he knows exactly what it takes.

He insists on calling this Chelsea team underdogs, but they are nothing of the sort. After a poor result against Aston Villa, they reacted well with an easy victory over Galatasaray and by absolutely thumping one of their title rivals.

Previous: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho knows what's required in order win league titles, as his record shows

Not convincing anyone: Mourinho may say his team are still underdogs in the title race, but they're definitely not

Emphatic: Chelsea ran riot in their 6-0 battering of fellow title contenders Arsenal at Stamford Bridge

Success: Jose Mourinho's previous title winning positions at this stage

That underlined just how strong they are and what a motivator Jose is.

With seven games to go, Mourinho is in exactly the same position as when he won his seven league titles – on top.

As
 the table right shows, he had comfortable leads in his early years but 
at Inter and at Real Madrid he demonstrated he can still win through 
when the going gets tough.

With the title race so tight this season, he will look at the Liverpool game at Anfield as one last obstacle to overcome.

If Chelsea can get through that then they may well be celebrating come May.

To the point: Oscar takes the plaudits after adding to Arsenal's humiliation at Stamford Bridge on Saturday

Tim Sherwood caused a furore when he criticised his players after their 4-0 loss at Chelsea, but now they have responded.

People said he risked losing the dressing room, but I’m sorry, footballers get paid a lot of money and they have to take the stick and get on with it.

Tim showed heart and you could see that reflected in Tottenham’s performance yesterday.

All smiles: Spurs manager Tim Sherwood will be pleased his players responded well to his criticism of them

Close up: Christian Eriksen scores Tottenham's first goal in their stirring comeback over Southampton

Triumph: The Spurs players celebrate with Gylfi Sigurdsson after he scored the winner over Southampton

They were unlucky to lose against Arsenal, showed some fight in Benfica last week and came from behind to beat Southampton.

Christian
 Eriksen was the difference and he looks the type of player Spurs fans 
love.

He linked well with Roberto Soldado, who did well, and they showed
 good fighting spirit.

Luis Suarez has to score six more goals to equal the Premier League record of 34 goals in a single season.

Do not be surprised if he breaks it.

Suarez has been phenomenal and has put himself up there with the likes of Thierry Henry. He’s been that good.

Hands up: Liverpool's Luis Suarez scored a hat-trick in the Reds' entertaining 6-3 win at Cardiff on Saturday

Deadly: Suarez has now scored 28 Premier League goals and is only six short of the record in one season

He has eight games left to set the 
record and that’s after he missed the first five of the season. It’s 
frightening to think what he could have finished on.

He
 has equalled Robbie Fowler’s Liverpool record of 28 Premier League 
goals in a season and in terms of ability he is right up there with the 
Liverpool greats. You can’t compare him to Kenny Dalglish because of 
Kenny’s longevity and what he achieved with the club, but Suarez can do 
anything.

Liverpool have 
some tough fixtures to come but there are a few Suarez will have his eye
 on, including a trip to Norwich – Suarez has 11 goals in five matches 
against them.

Partners: Suarez and Daniel Sturridge were on top form again as Liverpool racked up another win

The only minor
 criticism you can make is that he doesn’t always perform to his 
potential in the big games. In 26 matches against Chelsea, Arsenal and 
the Manchester clubs, he has only scored seven goals.

But
 with Chelsea and Man City still to visit Anfield, Suarez will want to 
set that right. If he does, he could well fire Liverpool to the title.

Well done: Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers congratulates Suarez on his goalscoring feats at Cardiff

Marksmen: The top Premier League scorers in one single season

As
 the table shows, Luis Suarez is close to becoming only the seventh 
player to score 30 or more Premier League goals in a season, and is six 
short of Andy Cole and Alan Shearer’s record.

Suarez missed the first five games of the season and he is the only striker on the list to average more than a goal per game.

What a season.

What
 a result for Norwich. Chris Hughton has been under all sorts of 
pressure this season, but he always seems to come up trumps.

Norwich were the only side to win in the bottom eight, and that could be enough to keep them safe.

Their last four games are against Liverpool, Man United, Chelsea and Arsenal, so points on the board are vital.

Winner: Norwich boss Chris Hughton motivated his team to a hugely important win over Sunderland

Take that: Alex Tettey wheels away in delight after adding Norwich's second in their 2-0 win over Sunderland

Burnley’s 3-0 win over Charlton was their seventh in nine games and they now look certain to come up.

The Championship is a tough league but manager Sean Dyche is a real personality. He is confident, talks well and the fans like him.

No wonder they call him the ginger Mourinho!

Norwich were the only team in the bottom eight to win this weekend and it could be enough to see they escape relegation
