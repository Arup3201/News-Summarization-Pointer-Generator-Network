Day trippers or commuters needing to travel to London by train can save up to £100 on their journey by booking in advance. 

A new infographic gives a breakdown of the price difference between buying a one-way ticket to the capital on the day and purchasing them from one to ten weeks before travel.

The most notable saving was for single fares from Edinburgh to London, which cost £125.80 on the day and £25.80 if booked ten weeks in advance, saving a whopping £100.

Super-organised folk, who are prepared to buy their ticket to the capital ten weeks in advance, will pay just £14, saving almost £65.

The infographic, compiled by vouchercloud.com, also compares single train ticket prices from Sheffield, Birmingham, Bristol, Exeter, Edinburgh, Leeds, Norwich and Cambridge to the capital.

For those travelling from Liverpool to London, a fare on the day will sting by as much as £78.70, whereas buying it two to five weeks' prior to travel will cost £27. 

All aboard: Some fares noticeably decrease the further in advance they are booked

While a day trip from Brighton to the capital is the cheapest at just £5 for anyone booking 10 weeks in advance - or it will cost £16.30 on the day.

Other fares noticeably decrease the further in advance they are booked - tickets for travel from London to Birmingham remain at £7.50 from two weeks before travel up to ten weeks.

A spokesman for vouchercloud.com said: 'With the recent news that rail fares are set to rise by 3.5 per cent in January 2015, we thought we would try and find a way to combat the already high cost of travelling by train by seeing just how much we can save by booking tickets, for some of the most popular routes in the UK, in advance.'
