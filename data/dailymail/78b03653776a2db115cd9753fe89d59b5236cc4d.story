If the late Michael Winner knew about this, he'd be telling pop singer Robbie Williams to 'calm down, dear'.

The 39-year-old star has splashed out £17.5million on Winner's former home, a 46-room mansion in west London's upmarket Holland Park.

It was sold despite Winner, the larger-than-life film director, having believed Woodland House was worth at least three times that price.

Father-of-one Williams, who has been living Los Angeles with his wife Ayda, is said to have been searching for a home for his family for more than a year.

Robbie Williams and his wife Ayda are buying Michael Winner's former home in Holland Park for £17.5million

The opulent home of the late Michael Winner and his wife
 Geraldine went on sale for less than a third of what he tried to sell it for in 2011

Wrong number: Michael Winner had previously put the house on the market 
for £60million, but nine months after his death it went on sale for 
£17.5million

Extravagance: The house was initially three flats, but Michael Winner converted it into a mansion

He wants his newborn daughter Theodora Rose to have a British passport and education, The Sunday Times reported today.

The
 couple already own an £8million seven-bedroom mansion in Wiltshire, but
 are believed to want their child, affectionately named 'Teddy', to grow
 up in London.

But Williams may want to be careful about playing his particular brand of pop music out loud in his new pad - his immediate neighbour is music legend Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin. 

Following his death at the house in January, it emerged that 
on top of substantial debts, Winner had taken out several mortgages 
against Woodland House to secure flats for his former girlfriends.

Winner shared the home with wife
 Geraldine - and several girlfriends before her - and tried to sell it in 2011 for £60million.

His father bought the leasehold property - which only has 31 years left on the agreement - in 1946 for just £2,000 and Winner, who spent millions reinstating the building to its former grandeur, was brought up there.

These
 pictures reveal the palatial size and extravagant luxury with which the
 residence was decorated - a real reflection of the larger-than-life 
personality of Winner.

No-holds-barred: Michael Winner took over the flats from his father in 1978 and spent millions on the conversion, building a swimming pool, cinema and extensive gardens

Staying British: According to his wife Geraldine it was the wish of Winner, who died in January this year, that the flat be sold to a British family who would not cut it up into flats

Little palace: Winner would hold extravagant parties at Woodland House, a large part of which he had decorated himself

The 
house sits on the bend of a leafy crescent in Kensington and was built 
in the Queen Anne style by Richard Norman Shaw for a Victorian artist 
called Sir Luke Fildes.

The
 house was originally three flats, which were bought by Winner's 
property magnate father, George, and it remains leasehold. The 
freeholder is Charlotte Townsend, one of Britain's richest women.

Winner
 took possession of the house in 1978 when it was still flats and spent 
millions creating an opulent home, complete with swimming pool, cinema 
and extensive gardens, which he loved.

Despite
 making the Victorian marvel a regular feature in celebrity and 
architectural magazines down the years, Winner was looking to sell the 
house in his later years.

Attempting a sale in 2011, Winner set the price at £60million, despite protests from the estate agent.

It
 was originally his wish that it be taken over by the local council and 
become a museum, but the council declined, saying they could not afford 
to run it.

Although it is 
possible the sale will follow the recent west London trend of being 
snapped up by foreign buyers, this is not the desire of the late 
Winner’s wife.

'I don't 
want developers coming and ripping everything apart and selling to some 
foreigners,' Geraldine Winner told the Sunday Times.

She expressed a wish that Woodland House be sold to a British family to be kept in its current state as one house.

'I think that's what Michael would have wanted as well,' she added.
