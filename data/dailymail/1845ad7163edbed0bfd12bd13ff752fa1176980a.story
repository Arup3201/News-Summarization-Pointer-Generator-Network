They have a coach for everything  in New York – and gorgeous Robyn Youkilis is a healthy eating coach who has become a good friend.

But she’s no Gwyneth-style self-punisher – Robyn loves to cook and eat. Her philosophy is: Getting healthy and losing weight without giving up your life.

She’s the one who taught me to make the perfect kale salad by ‘massaging’ the raw leaves with avocado.

Health Coach Robyn Youkilis shares her tips on how to eat right, stop cravings and maintain a healthy, happy diet

Next month she launches a free online coaching series, The Rockstar Roadmap. I asked her to share some of her tried-and-tested wisdom .  .  .

Can you sum up your attitude to a healthy diet in one sentence?

It’s not what you eat some of the time that makes you healthy, it’s what you eat most of the time.

What are a couple of your healthy store cupboard staples?

Coconut oil – it soothes your digestive tract, keeps your metabolism revved, and keeps you full. I add cinnamon to everything. It’s a great natural sweetener, helps satisfy sugar cravings, balances your blood sugar and contains fibre.

You drink quite a lot of tea too, don’t you?

Herbal tea, yes. Ginger and nettle help with digestion, South American mate gives me energy and Runa clears my mind. But mainly, tea can be a good way of beating cravings.

Should it be five-a-day, seven- a-day .  .  . or even ten-a-day?

I tell clients to eat greens until they’re coming out of their ears.

Salad wisdom: Robyn Youkilis' taught Ruby how to make the perfect kale salad by 'massaging' the raw leaves with avocado

I started having a kale smoothie for breakfast thanks to you!

That’s perfect. But mix it up,  try everything green.

What’s your food nemesis and how do you avoid eating it?

Peanut butter. I will literally fall into the jar, spoon first, and come out days later. If I end up there it’s because something else in my life is off balance. Our cravings are gateways telling us something else is wrong. I mostly keep it out of the house.

What are the most common problems you help clients with?

Usually they want to lose weight, and they’re trying to make better decisions but they’re still confused.

What’s your one tip for eating healthily even when too busy?

Master the simple act of .  .  . chewing! It gives your digestive system time to register that you  have eaten.

No pain no gain: Samantha Cameron reportedly enjoyed a Shiatsu massage on holiday

Cherie and Tony Blair were famously fans of a nice firm massage – on the table of fitness guru Carole Caplin.

Now it seems Samantha Cameron is getting in on the act, reportedly ‘indulging’ in Shiatsu massage while on holiday in Lanzarote over Easter.

I put the word indulging in inverted commas because this Japanese type of body manipulation, which works on the same principal as acupuncture and reflexology, involves lots of pinching, pulling, and pain.

It can be used to treat everything from general stress to digestive problems and even migraine. You do feel fabulous afterwards – but it is far from relaxing.

The trend for being a weekday vegan might
 sound daft in a ‘what IS the point?’ kind of way.

But I was interested 
to hear that former US President Bill Clinton, who famously gave up 
eating meat or animal-derived produce completely in a bid to improve his
 cardiovascular health, has started eating fish again on the advice of 
his doctor, Mark Hyman.

I’ve met Hyman and he sums up his philosophy: 
‘It’s hard being a vegan to eat enough good, quality protein and [easy] 
to have too much starch,’ he said. ‘I know a lot of fat vegans.’

I was interested to read that in a recent poll, 42 per cent of US workers had left a job due to an excessively stressful environment.

Meanwhile 61 per cent of American workers believe that work stress has been a cause of illness  for them.

In a lot of cases, the office environment itself can be to blame – and I for one know that since leaving my job to work for myself, I feel ten times healthier.

Not least, it got me away from the office feeders, who loved to crack open the chocolate biscuits  at 4pm every day on the dot.

Here's a fitness fashion  must-buy!

I recently travelled Down Under to visit friends and family in Australia and came across Vie Active, a new fitness label based near Bondi Beach.

I definitely took a bit of time out from my usual exercise routine while I was away, but the brilliant leggings, worn by a model on the left, have inspired me to get back in the gym pronto. Check out the styles at vieactivewear.com.
