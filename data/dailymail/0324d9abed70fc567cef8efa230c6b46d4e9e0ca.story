Thousands of job seekers queued for more than three hours in a desperate attempt to nab one of just 40 positions at supermarket giants Aldi.

The job hopefuls began queuing at 10am, despite the interviews not starting until 1pm, forcing staff to start 20 minutes early on Friday.

At least 1,500 candidates queued around the block for just 40 positions now available at Aldi stores across the Midlands.

Hopefuls: More than 1,000 jobseekers queued for just 40 jobs with budget supermarket chain Aldi

Each candidate was given a mini-interview with management teams from branches of the supermarket before handing in their CV and contact details.

A teenager, who did not want to be named and joined the winding queue at noon at the Bridgnorth store in Shropshire said: ‘I knew it started at 1pm so I wanted to get here early, but I didn’t expect there to be that many people.

‘I walked right up to the store and then noticed the queue and my heart sank, I walked to the back and it just went on and on, I didn’t think it would ever stop.

‘Before I got there I thought I would have a good chance of getting the job, but when I saw all those people I lost hope a bit.

‘The mini-interview went well, but it is hard to know if I will get the job as they have seen so many people.

‘It is hard for young people like myself to get a job, there just isn’t the opportunities out there and people don’t want to give you a chance.

‘I went for this job because you have to take what you can get, like I said, the opportunities are limited.’

The applicants, who were hoping for stock and store assistant positions with a minimum of 20 hours a week are likely to find out if they have got the job within the next month.

A mother-of-two, who queued since 10am added: ‘I heard a rumour that there would be a lot of people here so I got here at 10am and was one of the first.

‘I had to wait three hours, but it was relief when I saw how many people really did turn up, I couldn’t believe it.

‘It looked more like auditions for X-Factor, not a job for Aldi.

‘Hopefully I got the job, but you never know, with over a thousand people there it is hard to judge, I don’t know if being one of the first was an advantage or not.

‘I need this job to keep paying the bills and keep everything ticking over, including feeding my two children and getting them new school uniforms.'

The scene follows the release of new figures last week showing a record number of people are now in work, as unemployment continues to fall.

One hopeful said: 'It is hard for young people like myself to get a job, there just isn't the opportunities out there and people don't want to give you a chance'

Following the announcement of the  figures, the Prime Minister tweeted: ‘Another significant fall in unemployment is a sign our long-term economic plan is working, providing security & chances for hard-working people.

But it seems the situation in Bridgnorth has not changed since this time last year, when Aldi had a similar response to their job vacancies.

Area manager for the supermarket, Leon Donald said: ‘A previous event similar to this attracted around 1,500 people so we knew this event would be well attended.’

The 40 positions available were split between West Midlands’ stores in Dudley, Stourbridge, Halesowen, Brierley Hill, Netherton and Wollaston.

There were also positions available in Northamptonshire and Worcestershire.

According to the Office for National Statistics, over the past year, unemployment has decreased by -22.40 per cent in Shropshire.

But the percentage of people claiming unemployment benefits in the area has remained the same, at 2.1 per cent of the working age population.

This is unlike the much of the rest of the country which has seen a fall in the number claimants over the past year.
