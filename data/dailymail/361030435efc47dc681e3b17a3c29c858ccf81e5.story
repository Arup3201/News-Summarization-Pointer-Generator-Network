Mamma mia! That's a lot to ask from your fans.

Swedish supergroup Abba are appealing for cash from their fans to help fund their next release - despite being one of the most successful bands in music history.

The mega-rich quartet are using a 'direct-to-fan' crowd-funding website designed to help struggling artists in the music industry to allow their loyal following to pledge nearly £200 their money.

Money, money, money: Abba have sold more than 400 million records and their catalogue of hits is exceeded only by The Beatles

The site - PledgeMusic.com - features a number of emerging artists and some established artists looking for funding. But Abba are by far the biggest selling.

In return for their contribution Abba fans will get one of 5,000 copies of Abba - The Official Photo Book before it is released, and will 'be part of one of the most prestigious music books ever'.

The limited-edition, 
authorised history of the band’s career will be released next April to mark the 40th 
anniversary of the group's breakthrough win in the 1974 Eurovision Song 
Contest.

Comments on the site reveal fans are more than willing to shell out for the 460-page special Super Trouper edition book.

It comes with a foreword contributed by each member and 100 previously unseen photographs 'an extra section of 20 pages listing all the dedicated fans who have made this limited edition possible'.

David Legrand said: 'Looks like the ultimate ABBA book! Giant...'

Claire Goodwin said: 'I could not be more excited about this book! Just ordered my Super Trouper edition.. Can't wait!!!'

Abba have sold more than 400 million records and their catalogue of hits is exceeded only by The Beatles. The songwriters Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus have chalked up £100m each in their 40-year career.

The appeal says: 'This extraordinary book contains more than 600 pictures, more than 100 of which have never previously been published.

'See images from the pre-ABBA years, the formation of the band, ABBA’s incredible rise to success with their break-through at the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest in Brighton and the rocket ride to global super-stardom that followed.

'Private photographs are included as well as unpublished pictures by famous press photographers, alternative shots from album cover shoots and behind-the-scenes pictures from the major tours.'

It continues: 'This lavish coffee-table book has more than 400 pages and is in the format of a classic LP. It is printed on high quality matt art paper and is designed by Patric Leo who also designed Benny Andersson’s latest records.'
