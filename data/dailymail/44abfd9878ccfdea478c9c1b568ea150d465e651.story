Royal Navy warships arrived in Gibraltar this morning amid a diplomatic row with Spain over fishing around the British outpost.

The frigate HMS Westminster was seen approaching the port of Gibraltar at around 7.15am this morning, flanked by two smaller ships.

It sailed towards the Mediterranean enclave the day after Spanish fishermen in a fleet of almost 
40 boats sailed into British waters to demand an artificial 
reef made of concrete blocks - which they say ruins traditional fishing 
grounds - be removed.

Although British, Spanish, and Gibraltarian authorities have said the Navy's arrival at the British overseas territory is for long-scheduled exercises, some in Spain regard it as provocative.

Gibraltar's creation of the 
artificial reef with concrete blocks, which Spanish fishermen say blocks
their access to certain waters, has prompted Spain to toughen its 
border checks, leading to long queues for workers and tourists entering 
Gibraltar.

Spain claims the territory, which has a population of just 30,000, which it ceded to Britain by treaty 300 years ago.

In today's German Sueddeutsche 
Zeitung, Gibraltar Chief Minister Fabian Picardo accused the Spanish 
government of creating conflict to distract attention from corruption 
allegations against the ruling People's Party.

'In the 19th century, gunboats were used to do politics,' he said.

'Today our aim is to improve the living conditions of our citizens by means of cooperation.

'Unfortunately,
Spanish politicians are currently bringing the situation to a head and 
therefore making things worse for their own citizens in the surrounding 
regions.'

Protest: Spanish fishermen staged a protest yesterday at the site of an artificial reef built in Algeciras Bay, which they say ruins traditional fishing grounds

Row: A fleet of 38 Spanish fishing boats sailed towards Gibraltar yesterday to demand the British outpost remove 70 concrete blocks it has dropped in their fishing grounds

Picardo said the concrete reef was necessary to help marine life recover from overfishing.

As well as tightening border controls, Spain has threatened to charge tourists a 50 euro ($67) border levy, restrict the use of Spanish air space or block Gibraltar's lucrative ship fuelling business.

While Spain has threatened to take its claim to Gibraltar to the United Nations, Britain has asked the European Commission urgently to send monitors to verify whether the border checks breach EU rules.
