Juan Cuadrado appears to have swiftly settled into life at Chelsea and has been running the rule over his new team-mates in his first training session at the club.

Chelsea have a rare week off, giving Jose Mourinho a full seven days to prepare his side for their game against Aston Villa on Saturday.

And the Portuguese manager will be pleased to oversee a smooth transition for Cuadrado into the Chelsea side as his team battles for silverware on three fronts in the second half of the season.

Cuadrado could make his Chelsea debut at Villa Park on Saturday. 

The Colombian international put pen to paper on a four-and-a-half year deal at Stamford Bridge on deadline day on Monday after Andre Schurrle departed for Wolfsburg.

Cuadrado starred for Colombia at the 2014 World Cup as his national side reached the quarter-final before going out to hosts Brazil.

Cuadrado has taken the No 23 shirt at Chelsea and was delighted to join the Premier League leaders.

'This is a great club and honestly it is like a dream to join the Chelsea family and to know that the manager believes in me. I'm happy.'
