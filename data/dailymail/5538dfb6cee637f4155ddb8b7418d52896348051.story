Reconciliation: Natasha Gascoine has taken back rugby star husband Andy Powell back and the couple are expecting a baby

Rugby star Andy Powell is back with the wife who spray painted 'cheat' across his car and house as she reveals she is carrying his baby and says 'we still love each other'.

Natasha Gascoine branded the Wales and former British Lions player a 'liar, cheat and a scumbag' when their marriage failed after just nine months amid allegations he had cheated on her.

She also posted screengrabs of his sexually explicit texts to her on Twitter, and put the 32-year-old's rugby gear for sale on eBay, along with her wedding dress.

However, Ms Gascoine, 25, today confirmed that after 
three miscarriages she is pregnant again, and Powell is the father.

The pair started divorce proceedings in March and Ms Gascoine told friends they were ending their brief marriage amicably.

But it became very amicable - the pair kissed and made up and told their family and friends they still have a future together.

'Andy was ringing me and texting me and I ignored it but a a few weeks after we thought: "We'll put everything behind us and move forward",' she said.

'He said he didn't want us to get divorced - and we still love each other, there is no doubt about that.

'It took me a while to accept because I was still really angry.

'He said he would do various things to make it up to me and we'd get back on track and see each other here and there and now I'm pregnant again.'

Today the couple marked their first wedding anniversary at the Celtic Manor golf resort in Newport where the held their reception a year ago.

'We have spent most of the year living apart so it hasn't been much of a marriage,' she said.

'But we are both determined to give it another go - we have to forget about some of the things we did and said to each other and move on.'

After returning from a holiday to Dubai with a female friend, Ms Gascoine announced she is pregnant for the fourth time in just over a year.

She tweeted at the weekend: 'Coming back from Dubai & I have found out I'm pregnant for the fourth time in almost a year," she wrote on Twitter, posting a photograph of her positive pregnancy test.

'Soo
 nervous :( really wish I could be excited and calm about it. Trying not
 to build up my hopes but also to avoid thinking the worse possible 
scenario :(

'Fingers crossed
 and God's luck everything turns out ok. I got to 17 weeks last time... 6
 weeks second and very early few weeks first time. Extremely nervous :( 
xxxxx.'

Update: Ms Gascoine took to Twitter to reveal that she was pregnant with Powell's baby

Just two months ago the pair were in the middle of a very public break-up over Powell's alleged infidelity, drinking and gambling.

Ms Gascoine was 17 weeks pregnant at the time and was devastated when she lost the baby at the beginning of April, even though she and Powell had split.

The pair had argued very publicly via Twitter, and the row included 6ft 4in Powell bizarrely posting a naked picture of himself.

She then sprayed the words 'scumbag' and cheat over his house and pink Mercedes, and even went onto eBay to sell her £10,000 engagement ring, wedding ring, jewellery, dress and the gifts the pair received on the big day.

She wrote on the auction website: 'The sentimental value has gone and to be honest.

'Since being married to him I have realised how fake he really is. And what a great let down he has been.'

Office
 worker Ms Gascoine gave the proceeds of her clear out to Women's Aid 
and Samaritans - charities she describes as "close to her heart".

She
 said at the time: 'I don't think Andy Powell knows who he really is, 
he's built a character to fool everyone who knows him and I fell for it.

'I
 wouldn't want anyone else going through what I have been through, I've 
been holding up my wedding dress, thinking of the future we had planned -
 destroyed.'

Back row forward Powell responded by saying he hated her and 'could never forgive her'.

Powell played for the 
Cardiff Blues, Wasps and Sale Sharks during his rugby career, before 
crossing codes to play rugby league for the Wigan Warriors.

But his move ended after just five games for Wigan when he picked up a neck injury, and he was released by the club in January.

He won 23 caps for Wales, and toured South Africa with the British and Irish Lions in 2009.

But he was also known for his off-field problems. In 2011 was suspended after getting embroiled in a bar brawl with football fans.

In 2010 he was banned from driving for 15 months and fined £1,000 for driving the 
stolen cart along the hard shoulder of the M4 to 'get some munchies' 
from a service station at 5.30 in the morning.

Powell moved back in with his parents in his home town of Brecon, Powys, after the break-up and Ms Gascoine revealed they are still not living together.

She is staying with her parents at their country home in Monmouthshire while Powell gets his life back on track.

'He is still drinking but he has given up gambling which is an improvement,' she said.

'But he chose to go on a golfing holiday with his mates rather than come to Dubai with me.

'He's able to go on trips while I'm at home stressing and worried and feeling really anxious. I'm just hanging onto his word all the time.

'Unless he was to get his career back on track, or some kind of job, I think he's always going to be distracted. He knows a lot of people, he likes to socialise.'

Powell and Ms Gascoine are due to have the first scan of their baby later this week.

She said: 'We are both excited but I am very worried. I have lost the previous three, I don't want it to happen again.'

Ms Gascoine admitted she still has 'trust issues' with Powell but insists he has never been attracted to rugby groupies throwing themselves at him.

'I have heard from a few good friends that he's had women sitting on his lap and he's been pushing them away,' she said.

'He'll even leave a club, because he's never liked women pestering him.

'If he was to react back on that and I found out about that then obviously I would be concerned.'

Powell was unavailable to comment on getting back with his wife yesterday.
