Amateur singers and community choirs are being asked to donate their voices to a charity single that will feature in the Christmas TV commercial for Waitrose.

Thousands of voices will be overlaid on the song, which will be released for purchase on the basis that the profits will be split between three UK charities helping the elderly, children and those struggling to buy food.

The song chosen for the TV first is the Dolly Parton track 'Try' and it will be produced David Kosten, who uses the name Faultline and has worked with the likes of Coldplay's Chris Martin, The Flaming Lips, and R.E.M's Michael Stipe.

Amateur singers can 'donate' their voices to Waitrose to be used in a new charity single 

It will be heard hundreds of times as the backing track to the Waitrose Christmas commercial in the run up to December 25.

The pressure is on retailers to come up with something different and memorable for their festive campaigns and Waitrose, which is part of the John Lewis group, hopes this will draw shoppers in.

The initiative taps into the extraordinary resurgence of community and workplace choirs that has been led by choirmaster Gareth Malone.

The supermarket will donate profits from the single to three UK charities 

The champion of choral singing has inspired millions with TV series revealing how he has taught everyone from troubled schoolchildren to military wives to deliver magnificent performances.

The Military Wives achieved the remarkable feat of having a Christmas number one in 2011 with the song Wherever You Are, which helped raise fund for Forces charities.

The supermarket has written to choirs around the country and it will run an online campaign from Saturday (Oct 18) urging shoppers to form a virtual choir and sing the soundtrack for its Christmas advert.

People are being asked to visit the Waitrose 'Donate Your Voice' website between Oct 18-28 to record and upload their own rendition of the Dolly Parton song.

When members of the public donate their voice online, they will be also asked to put a virtual green token in a box to support one of the three charities involved, Age UK, Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity and The Trussell Trust, which supports food banks.

 

Waitrose marketing director, Rupert Thomas: 'We really hope 'Donate Your Voice' will put the fun into fundraising for the festive season, especially with the growing popularity of people joining a choir.

The charity single will be a cover of Dolly Parton's 'Try', a song originally released earlier this summer

'Not only will we be able to create a totally unique soundtrack which has never been produced for advertising in this way before, but the public will be raising much needed funds for three fantastic causes.'

Dolly Parton, who gave a stand-out performance at this year's Glastonbury Festival, released the song in the summer and she has used it as the theme for her own campaigning work on improving literacy.

The programme, 'The Imagination Library', has so far seen her give away over 60 million books across the US, Canada, Australia and the UK.

The song does not have a Christmas theme, however the lyrics talk about striving to overcome difficulties in life.

Describing the song, she said: 'It's based on the fact a lot of my relatives couldn't read and write and I saw how crippling that was, but also the struggles I've gone through as an artist and in my life.

'It's about saying you've just gotta get out there and try. It's an uplifting encouraging song. You're not going to amount to anything unless you try.'
