Correctly judging your speed to beat the traffic lights is a goal most drivers struggle to achieve, so imagine that happening 55 times in a row.

That's what happened to New York City motorist Tim Burke who managed the momentous trip across the notoriously congested streets of Manhattan.

Mr Burke completed the journey from 109th and Fifth down to 52nd Street where he turned left and drove two blocks to 52nd and Park where he was finally caught by a red light.

Mr Burke's amazing journey began at 109th and Fifth and he didn't hit a red light until 52nd and Park Avenue

Tim Burke maintained speeds of between 28mph and 33mph to hit 55 consecutive green lights

Mr Burke waited until 3am to undertake the momentous drive across Manhattan's notoriously congested roads

The driver was precisely maintaining his speed to take advantage of the 'green wave' strategy where lights switching are staggered by 10 seconds so cars going 30mph are able to keep moving.

Mr Burke said he kept his speed between 28mph and 33mph when he made the 3am run in March 2013.

The video has been watched almost 100,000 times online and his automotive efforts were praised by other users.

One, Gordon Freeman, wrote: 'My highest is 8 [sic] never more than that sigh .'

Another user wrote: 'Very Cool video... Its crazy to see that many green lights haha.ï»¿'
