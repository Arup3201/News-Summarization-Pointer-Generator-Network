Mario Balotelli donned personalised gloves showing a skull with a blonde mohican and 'MB45' written on the forehead as the striker prepared for Real Madrid with his Liverpool team-mates at Anfield.

The Italian is yet to score for Liverpool in the Premier League but the 24-year-old will hope  to be a nuisance against Cristiano Ronaldo and Co in the Champions League on Wednesday night.

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has a decision to make whether to select Balotelli against the European champions, with striker Daniel Sturridge sidelined by a calf injury for 'two to four weeks'.

Rodgers welcomes Carlo Ancelotti's team to a blustery Anfield looking to disrupt their 100 per cent start in Group B.

Last year's Premier League runners-up beat Ludogorets Razgrad 2-1 before losing 1-0 in Basle ahead of Wednesday night's match.

Their season has stuttered, despite a 3-2 win against QPR on Sunday that saw Balotelli fail to open his Premier League account with Liverpool.

The former Manchester City forward missed an open goal at Loftus Road, and is yet to justify his £16million move from AC Milan.

The match against Real comes after Steven Gerrard revealed he turned down the chance to switch Anfield for the Bernabeu earlier in his career.

And the Liverpool captain admits he may regret not doing so when he retires from football.

'I have had a couple of options through my career to go to Real Madrid but I resisted temptation because of the feeling I had for my hometown club,' the former England skipper said.

'It might be something I regret down the line for not challenging myself and experiencing another country but I would have had an even bigger regret leaving Liverpool. I had a great admiration for Madrid but for me Liverpool is my No 1 club.'
