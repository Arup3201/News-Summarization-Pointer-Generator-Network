A survey has ranked cabin staff in the U.S. on how rude they are and unfortunately it is bad news for budget flyers. 

More than a quarter of 3,400 frequent passengers polled found the carrier Spirit as having the rudest flight attendants. 

Surprisingly, Air Canada came in second with 14 per cent of the vote.

Southwest however got just one per cent of the vote. 

The survey was carried out by Airfarewatchdog and was based on the number of passengers who had flown between January and October 2013.

George Hobica, founder and president of Airfarewatchdog, said: 'There's very little that's surprising here, with Spirit leading the list and Southwest at the bottom. 

• Spirit — 26%

• Air Canada — 14%

• Frontier — 11%

• Virgin America — 9%

• Allegiant — 8%

• United — 7%

• US Airways — 7%

• American — 5%

• AirTran — 3%

• Delta — 2%

• Hawaiian — 3%

• JetBlue — 3%

• Alaska — 1%

• Southwest — 1%

'It's a little surprising that Virgin America is near the top, although in all my years of travelling, I'd never had a problem with a flight attendant until I flew first class on Virgin America and encountered the rudest, most inattentive flight attendant I can ever remember. 

'So maybe there's something going on there.'

In less than two weeks, a video featuring Southwest Airlines flight attendant Marty Cobb’s hilarious rendition of the pre-flight safety speech has racked up more than 11 million hits on YouTube.

'Position your seatbelt tight, low and across your hips, like my grandmother wears her support bra,' she said as passengers began realising they weren't hearing the standard information.

She added that if they landed near a hot tub 'everybody gets their very own teeny weeny yellow Southwest bikini' - as other staff held up life jackets.

Despite her gags, she still managed to provide passengers all necessary safety information, and no one was left complaining. 

'That's what we call very cheap entertainment,' she said as she finished the routine. 'Nobody had to pay extra but you certainly don't get a refund!'

Marty Cobb's gags had passengers roaring with laughter and got her a round of applause at the end

Viewers applauded her light take on the often stale announcement.

'No one ever pays attention to the safety precautions, let alone claps at the end,' one YouTube user said. 'It was actually worth paying attention to. This was awesome!'

Another added: 'I should start flying with Southwest.'
