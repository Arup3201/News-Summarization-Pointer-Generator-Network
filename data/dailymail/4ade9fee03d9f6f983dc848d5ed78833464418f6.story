A married crime scene investigator looking into the death of a real estate developer’s wife had an affair with a fellow detective, she dramatically admitted to the murder trial jury.

Detective Anna Howell, who was the lead CSI investigator in the 2007 death of Eleonora Kaufman, 33, admitted that she had an affair with Detective Anthony Angula.

He is the lead detective on the case, in which Adam Kaufman is accused of strangling his wife.

Defence attorney William Matthewman asked Howell if it was true that she had intimate relations with Angula.

Howell danced around answering the question, instead telling the court: ‘I am married and I have three kids and my job is important to me,’ according to NBC Miami.

She later said that her husband was aware of the affair, adding: ‘I am happily married and I don’t have any issues with that any longer.’

The tension reached boiling point when Matthewman accused Howell of perjury and asked simply – yes or no – if she had an affair with the detective.

‘Yes,’ she answered, before storming out of the courtroom, according to CBS Miami.

The ‘gotcha’ moment was damaging to the prosecution, who is accusing Kaufman of strangling his wife in their Florida home in 2007.

Earlier this week, the Florida court listened to the dramatic 911 call made by a husband accused of strangling his wife to death, but whose defence claims died of a previously undetected heart condition.

'Oh my god - I don't know what is going on,' Kaufman was heard by the court to say upon reporting finding his 33-year-old wife Eleonora (Lina) unconscious on their bathroom floor in November 2007.

'I don't know what happened. She's on the floor dying. She's not breathing.'

On trial for the second-degree murder of his wife, the prosecution allege that the call occurred moments after Kaufman strangled his wife to death at their Aventura, Florida, home.

Wiping tears away from his eyes as he sat in court, Kaufman watched as the prosecution showed the jury pictures of his wife's body covered in cuts and abrasions, which they said were not there hours before her death.

'Lina Kaufman died as a result of mechanical asphyxiation to her neck, and her husband is the one who did it,' said prosecuting attorney Joseph Mansfield to the jury according to ABC News

According to the defence, Kaufman woke up and found his wife dead on the floor of their bathroom with her neck lying on a magazine rack in the early hours of November 7, 2007.

'The state's evidence cannot even prove that a homicide occurred, let alone that Adam Kaufman did it,' said defence attorney Bill Matthewman.

The prosecution acknowledged that it took state medical examiners 18 months to issue a finding that Lina Kaufman's death was murder, but Mansfield said that was due to all possible alternatives being considered.

Dr. Bruce A. Hyma, Miami-Dade County's chief medical examiner explained that 'only direct focused pressure' consistent with pressure exerted by another person could have caused the deep bleeding discovered in the victim's neck muscles.

'A healthy, active woman, arguable in the best shape of her life, and all that ended because of the actions of that man, her husband,' said Mansfield according to the Miami Herald

The defence team for Kaufman told the jury that Lina Kaufman was cursed with fainting episodes and also had significant scarring on her heart, which could have been the cause of her collapse.

They also concluded that the injuries to the mother-of-two's neck were the result of falling and hitting the magazine rack in the bathroom.

'This case is a tragedy of errors. An innocent man was charged with a non-existent crime, this is a prosecution in search of a crime,' said Matthewman.

The death of Lina Kaufman came to national prominence when her husband was charged with her murder in 2009, 18 months after her death and only when Kaufman complained to the medical examiner's office about the amount of time spent on the investigation.

Appearing in court in 2009, the property developer's defence initially hinged around a spray tan the day before her death, Lina's first ever, which was claimed caused her to have a massive allergic reaction according to NBC Miami

However, the prosecution have been dismissive of this claim and that of Lina suffering from a bad heart.

'Under the laws of science, it's impossible to have happened either way the defendant suggested it happened,' said Mansfield.

Opening the case by playing the distressing 911 call, Kaufman was heard hysterically screaming that his wife is not breathing.

The prosecution alleged that the information Kaufman gave on the call was that of a calculating man beginning to cover his tracks.

'Lina had a bad heart,' countered defence attorney Bill Matthewman.

'You will hear no motive. No evidence of a motive whatsoever.

'No life insurance. No financial crimes. No affairs during the marriage on behalf of Adam or Lina.

'No neighbours heard any arguments.'

Under house arrest with his two children since 2009, Kaufman is supported by his wife's family and her mother will testify to the court that her daughter 'suffered from seizures, from fainting, from headaches.'

It was on November 6, 2007, that Eleonora 'Lina' Kaufman received her first even spray tan, went to see a girlfirned who looked at the work and noted at the time there were no bruises on her body.

Then at 6 a.m on November 7, a frantic sounding Kaufman phoned 911 to report his wife's death, in a phone call which lasted more than 15 minutes.

'Oh God! Oh God! Lina,' cried Kaufman as he was instructed to give his wife CPR.

During the trial today, the jury heard from Dr. Tracy Baker, a plastic surgeon who had performed breast-implant surgery on Lina Kaufman.

He told told the court that he knew Lina to be fit and to work out two to three times a week and that during his examination of her never found any heart symptoms.

The court also heard from Larissa Adamyan, Lina's best friend who said that she had seen her friend have at least one fainting spell.

'She was dizzy, she called she called me. She was dizzy and on the floor,” said Adamyan according to CBS Miami

The police first became suspicious of Kaufman after one officer noted that his Mercedes-Benz was warm on the hood and was making clicking sounds as though it had just been driven when they arrived at his house on the night his wife died.

In addition, two firefighters who arrived at the scene told the court that it was suspicious to them that Kaufman was dressed and that only one side of the pair's bed appeared to have been slept in.

The defence dismissed this as pure speculation and even went as far as to say that the emergency workers could have mistaken Kaufman's identical twin Seth, who lived down the street and had come to the house that night, for his brother.

Lt. Michael Castro reported that Kaufman told emergency workers that he found his wife slumped over a toilet like she had been vomitting.

The firefighter said that Kaufman changed his story at Aventura Hospital and said that he found his wife's neck resting on the magazine rack.

He also added that he was wary of Kaufman's 'odd' behaviour that shifted from calm to angry.

'It was almost like an act,' said Castro.

The defence have hired Dr. Michael Bodden, the former medical examiner for New York City to debunk the prosecutions claims.

'The investigation underlying this case was biased, incompetent, flawed and inept,' said Matthewman.

Currently free on bail of $500,000, Kaufam could be sentenced to life imprisonment if he is convicted.
