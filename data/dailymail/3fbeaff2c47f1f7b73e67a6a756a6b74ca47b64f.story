Hot date? Hairy legs? Relax. A curtain has fallen forever on the age of getting lumbered with unwanted hair that you need to remove at a moment's notice.

Now you can slip a handy razor the size of a credit card into your purse or wallet and enables you to give yourself a quick swipe at any time of day or night

And the compact, £9.99 gadget, named the Carzor, is so efficient it even comes with a mirror and two spare blades.

Never be caught hairy again, thanks to the Carzor, a razor the size of a credit card that slips neatly into your wallet

Available on Firebox,
the nifty contraption means the men and women of Britain need never 
again dash from the house worrying about turning up at an important 
meeting with hairy faces, legs or underarms.

The
Carzor features a detachable razor, two spare blades and an inbuilt 
mirror, meaning you have everything you need to watch those lively 
bristles disappear.

Just don't wedge it in an ATM.
