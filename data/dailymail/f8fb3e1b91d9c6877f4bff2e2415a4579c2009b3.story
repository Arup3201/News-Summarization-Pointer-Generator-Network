A man has been arrested in Brisbane for using medical cannabis on his critically ill two-year-old daughter.

After hearing positive stories about the benefits of the treatment, the 30-year-old father decided to give cannabis oil to his daughter who is battling a rare form of cancer.

Despite his claims that it improved her condition, the father, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was charged with administering a dangerous drug to a minor.

He appeared in court on Friday, where he was granted the right to visit his daughter, having previously been refused access after he was charged.

The young girl’s mother, who is estranged from the father, does not agree with his actions and the method of treatment he chose to use on their daughter.

The father has been charged for treating his 2-year-old daughter with medical cannabis oil

The adorable little girl was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer shortly before Christmas

The father was charged on January 2nd, for using the drug on his daughter, in a bid to treat her cancer. 

The little girl, who was diagnosed with the deadly disease shortly before Christmas, has an 11cm cancerous growth which is putting pressure on her internal organs.

Her parents have been told she has a fifty per cent chance of survival. 

The father is reportedly estranged from the two-year-old's mother and she has made it very clear that she does not support his actions. She doesn't believe there's been an improvement in her daughter's condition.

He has relocated to Brisbane to be with his daughter during her treatment and is living out of a suitcase.

The dad was desperate to find a solution to his daughter's pain and administered the medical cannabis oil mixed  with coconut, to increase her rate of survival.

'My aim was to create an alkaline climate in her body, provide a nutrient dense diet, alkaline water, essential oil therapy and a healing environment of fun and positivity,' he said.

'Her cancer ridden little body was alive again. [My daughter] had almost instant quality of life,' he said.

'She would say “Daddy, tummy's not sore". She would be able to eat like a champion and began to gain weight,'

'Her energy was up and she wanted to go outside with me instead of lay on her back with legs curled up. Her skin colour came back, her eyes were sparkling again,' the father has said.

However, according to him, his daughter is now struggling to breath on her own and is having seizures following her withdrawal from the cannabis oil.

'She has spiralled downhill since she lost her daddy and oil treatment. I pray that I will see her again one way,' he said. 

He appeared in the Brisbane Magistrates court today charged with possession of a dangerous drug and administering a dangerous drug to a minor under the age of 16. As part of his bail he has now been allowed access to his daughter in hospital.

A group of people holding placards  turned out at the court in support of the father and to protest against his arrest.

The father, who works  with the Catholic Education Department, was left devastated when he was unable to log on to the work system after having his Blue Card revoked.

Having sent numerous emails to the Education Department asking for permission to take 12 months carer leave with no response, he was shocked at their decision. 

He received a letter in the post to say his Blue Card had been revoked, claiming the change in his police information meant his employer must not continue to employ him. 

However the Catholic Education Department  has made it clear that they support him and this was merely a legality.

'[The father] is still employed by Catholic Education and is currently on paid leave,' they said.

They said he is free to speak to them regarding his employment and can access their employee assistance program.

Since the excruciating decision was made to ban the father from seeing his dying daughter, he has set up a campaign to raise awareness of his situation.

The girl's mother said the little girl has been requesting Peppa Pig DVDs in hospital and was delighted recently when her older sister  visited her sick bed.

The dad received good news as a result of the campaign, when he was granted permission to contact the hospital on a daily basis to be updated on his daughter's condition.

A petition has attracted nearly 15,000 supporters and his campaign has attracted a lot of support.

He argued that he 'deserves to have his parental rights to see his child reinstated, the charges against him dropped by a court and the right to decide the treatment options for his own child.'

'There is ample evidence to show that medical cannabis has many beneficial effects for cancer patients without the harmful side effects and other associated risks of current drug treatments,' he said.

A fund has been set up in the two-year-old's name and is in the hands of his mother. He said all money raised from the account will be used for his daughter's ongoing journey and recovery.

His arrest comes after the NSW government announced there will be a range of clinical trials administered to test the benefits of medical marijuana.

'Medical Cannabis oil is an amazing healer and needs to be made available for anyone in need.' the father said.

'My goal is the have these charges thrown out. [The girl] needs her Daddy by her side.'
