Never mind who is the fairest of the them all, this year's Miss England wannabes want to prove who is the fittest of them all.

The beauty queens swapped their heels for trainers at the Kelham Hall and Country Park, near Newark, Nottinghamshire, today to take part in a challenging boot camp.

The workout, led by specialist military trainers, had a competitive element as a place in the Miss England final was up for grabs.

Who is the fittest of them all? A place in the Miss England final was up for grabs

Keep on running: The beauty queens had to do shuttle runs and the bleep test

Attention! Military trainers put the women through their paces

A total of 79 girls put through their paces ahead of the Miss England final - which will be held in Torquay next month. Their strenuous workout included a bleep test, push-ups and shuttle runs - in temperatures reaching 23 degrees.

After the hour-long session, Laura Clare, 17, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was named as Miss Sportswoman.

The way to a flat stomach: The competitors do sit ups in the sun

Work it: Press ups were also enforced

Stretch: The beauty queens took part in the boot camp at Kelham Hall, Nottinghamshire

Keeping up appearances: A couple of the competitors took part with their hair in rollers

Fashion error: The hair rollers and sandals weren't too practical for the more active parts of the workout

Like she just stepped out of a salon: This beauty queen's attire wasn't in keeping with most of her fellow contestants who had opted for shorts, vests and trainers

It means blonde Laura, who won Miss South Yorkshire in February, will be fast-tracked to the final on June 14 with the chance of reaching the Miss World championships.

The college student, who is studying business management, said it was the prize of reaching the final that kept her going.

She said: 'It was totally overwhelming, I didn't think I'd even get through the first bleep test. I really wanted to get through to the finals so I think that's what kept me going.

'I thought I was goner in the first few minutes, I was absolutely knackered. But somehow I pushed through, don't ask me how as I just don't know. When we hit the bleep test I really didn't think I could manage more.

Change of scene: They are more used to strutting their stuff on the catwalk than the playing field

Testing: The girls followed military training techniques

Ready to go: The girls wait to hear what exercises are in store

Achievement: Their trainer said they did well to complete the workout on such a hot day

Feet up: Keeping fit is all part of being a modern day beauty queen

Eye on the prize: The girls knew a place in the Miss England final was at stake

Survival of the fittest: The Miss England hopefuls have all won regional titles and want to become the national star

'Then we had to do sit ups and burpees and all sorts, it was intense. Now I just feel excited that I'm through to the final.'

Other contestants seemed to take it less seriously than Laura, taking part in hair rollers and sandals.

James Evans, co-founder of Xtreme Boot Camps, who led the workout said he didn't go easy on the girls who all proved they are more than just a pretty face.

He said: 'The fitness tests are like no other the contestants have previously experienced, they'll certainly be in excellent shape for the rest of the judging process. We tested the contestants not just physically but for mental toughness too.

Tested: The fitness trainers said they didn't go easy on the beauty queens

And the winner is... Laura Clare, 17, was crowned Miss Sportswoman following the boot camp

Worth it: The Miss South Yorkshire said she was delighted to be fast-tracked to the Miss England final following the fitness tests

'Xtreme Boot Camps instructors are all serving or ex-military personnel, fitness qualified to at least Level 3, using tried and tested military training techniques. 'The winner of the semi-final is fast-tracked through to the final so it's a huge responsibility to find a deserving winner. Laura really pushed herself and thoroughly deserves her title. 'The heat today has made the boot camp even tougher than usual and all the girls deserve huge respect for their achievement. 'Angie Beasley, director of Miss England, added: 'We were very impressed with the Xtreme Boot Camps training ethos and how the team intends to put hopefuls through a boot camp fitness experience that they will benefit hugely from.'
