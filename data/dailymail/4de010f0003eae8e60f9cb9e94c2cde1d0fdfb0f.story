Seventies heartthrob David Cassidy has pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of driving while intoxicated in upstate New York.

Cassidy, who was famous for his role in the 1970s show The Partridge Family, admitted a charge of misdemeanor DWI.

Cassidy's role on TV's 'The Partridge Family' launched a singing career. He spends time in New York during the summer at Saratoga Race Course, 40 miles north of Schodack

The Times Union reported Cassidy was on the verge of tears during his court appearance, telling the judge: 'Your honor, I came here today hoping to get this taken care of and over with.'

Outside court he then vented his frustrations to the crowd, adding: 'I'm not pleased how this turned out tonight, but at least I'm not going to prison.'

He plead guilty in exchange for a conditional discharge which requires 50 hours of community service. 

The court heard how he was stopped near Schodack, New York, by the town police officer named Tom Jones - who was unaware of his Welsh namesake.

When the officer revealed his name, Cassidy joked: 'What's new pussycat?'

While Cassidy was famous for his role in The Partridge Family and subsequent singing career, he made appearances in dozens of other TV series, including The Love Boat, Mod Squad and Fantasy Island.

However in recent years he has suffered from brushes with the law.

In March, a judge in Los Angeles sentenced Cassidy to three months in rehab and five years of probation in a drunken-driving case stemming from a January arrest for an illegal turn.
