Just like Diana, the Duchess of Cambridge is a patron is several charities and recently announced her plans to work with the Scouting Association

Princess Diana, who was renowned for her charity work, left large shoes to fill after her untimely death.

But it seems that the Duchess of Cambridge is doing an extremely good job of filling them.

Not only is she a loyal patron of several charities but now she is set to follow in Diana and Williams footsteps by spending a night sleeping rough on the streets of London.

Kate will join Centrepoint ambassador 
and Loose Women star Lisa Maxwell on the Sleep Out campaign to raise 
awareness of the growing homeless problem in the capital.

48-year-old
Lisa Maxwell told Kate she should follow her husband's example and join
her on the streets the next time she was involved, and Kate agreed.

Prince William's mother regularly made secret visits to homeless shelters, even taking the young prince with her.

The experience is said to have 
encouraged him to become a patron of the charity Centrepoint as an adult
and in 2009 he spent a night sleeping rough in sub-zero temperatures 
amid wheelie bins close to Blackfriars Bridge to raise the charityâ€™s 
profile.

And now it's his wife's turn to endure a night out in the elements.

Lisa
and Kate were introduced by William at a party and the pair immediately
hit if off. Lisa told Kate she worked with Centrepoint and Kate was 
extremely interested, asking Lisa enthusiastically about her 
work.

Lisa said: 'She asked me about sleeping out, so I said: "Next time I do it, you're doing it with me. No excuses, he's done it." She said: "You're on."'

The loose 
women star spoke in admiration of the young Royal at London's Brasserie 
Blanc at the after party of her new play, Chicken.

'She is very savvy and very smart,' she said.

Sleeping rough: In the winter of 2009, Prince William and Seyi Obakin, CEO of homeless charity Centrepoint, spent a night on the streets in freezing temperatures to experience being homeless

Three years ago, William was joined on his night sleeping rough by Centrepoint chief executive, Seyi Obakin, and his private secretary, Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton.

It wasn't a peaceful night under the stars for the three musketeers, who nearly got run over by a roadsweeper.

Writing on the Centrepoint website, Seyi revealed: 'William was determined to do it as patron to raise awareness of the problem and to be able to understand a little better what rough sleepers go through.'

Charitable work: Princess Diana was the patron of the Centrepoint charity for the homeless and introduced her son to the good cause

At the time, a St James' Palace spokesman said: 'Prince William took away from the experience the importance of tackling all the issues that cause people to be homeless and stay homeless, from drug dependency to mental health problems.'

Centrepoint helps the homeless in London and the North East and was one of six organisations Diana remained patron of when she scaled back her charitable interests.

Kate and William visited the charity last year and joined in on a healthy eating cookery programme.

The work of William and Kate is fundamental to the charity as the latest figures reveal that there has been a 20 per cent increase in those sleeping rough in a year
