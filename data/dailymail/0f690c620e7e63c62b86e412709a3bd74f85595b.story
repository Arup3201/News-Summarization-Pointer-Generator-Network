A millionaire Manhattan investment banker was so keen to get out of paying a debt - that he preferred to expose the details of the sordid affair that ended his marriage instead.

Hugh Levey, 65, owes $1.3million to a Virginia investment firm called Pensmore  after he lost the money in a bad investment.

But instead of paying up Levey has engaged in a drawn-out court battle that made documents about his 12-year affair with business partner and TV talking head Claire Gruppo public.

According to court papers obtained by The New York Post  Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Shirley Kornreich ruled that Levey must pay up what is owed. 

However, instead of stumping up the cash, he has used documents about his highly confidential net-worth statement, which was part of his divorce from his wife of 40 years Wendy Levy.

The paperwork showed that while Levey, who has a Harvard MBA, is cash poor, with $500 in a checking account, $200 cash on hand and no savings, he was worth $29 million.

His funds are invested in a $15 million Fifth Avenue apartment, a $5 million Greenwich home and millions in various trusts and personal items.

Yet the millionaire 'deliberately keeps himself cash poor in order to avoid judgments, a trick he learned in a personal bankruptcy in the 1990s,' the Pensmore suit says.

Meanwhile, despite being the co-founder of Gruppo, Levey & Co. he relies on his mistress, Gruppo, 61, to give him spending money.

Pensmore is now suing Levey to force the sale of $2 million in antiques, art and jewelry listed on his net worth statement to pay off the debt.
