Ed Balls claimed the current system of university financing would leave a 'huge looming charge' for taxpayers

Labour's plan to cut tuition fees to £6,000 a year will inflict 'colossal damage' on universities, top academics have warned today.

University leaders said the move could leave them £10billion out of pocket and said it was 'implausible' that the government could step in to make up the difference given the state of the public finances.

But Labour hit back this morning, claiming the current system was unfordable for students and taxpayers. Ed Balls said new figures showed half the student debts would never be repaid – leaving the government with a £2.5billion bill.

But in a letter to the Times, a group of university vice chancellors accused Labour of failing to understand that cutting fees will only benefit richer graduates – because under the present system, people only start paying back their loans once they earn more than £21,000 a year.

Student debts are also written off after 30 years.

The vice-chancellors said Mr Miliband's plans to lower tuition fees by £3,000 would leave £2billion a year out of pocket.

They fear future Labour governments would be unable to find an extra £2 billion a year in the present financial climate.

Sir Christopher Snowden, vice-chancellor of the University of Surrey, said: 'This is purely a pragmatic issue, that a policy is evolving on the hoof which is not really a practical policy going forward and the potential damage is colossal:

'I really feel Labour has missed the point here. If you talk to students and to many mums and dads, the £9,000 [fee] is no longer the key topic.' 

Simon Gaskell, president of Queen Mary University London, added: 'What our students tell us is that clearly the debts incurred through fees is important, but what would be a real game-changer for students, or what can defeat students, is the debt that arises from living expenses while they are at university.

'If money were to be spent to support the most needy students to go to university, subsidising fees is not the way to do it.'

Cost cutting: Labour is struggling to work out how to pay for a pledge it has already made to slash university tuition fees from the current maximum of £9,000 a year to £6,000

But Mr Balls claimed the current system of university financing would leave a 'huge looming charge' for taxpayers as many graduates fail to pay back the cost of their tuition.

'The universities are hugely important but the status quo is not working well at the moment for the students, for taxpayers and the Government for a clear reason… we were told that the increase in fees to £9,000 would save money for taxpayers, save billions and deliver a good deal.

'What we've seen is graduate contributions go up by over 50%, graduates paying for their fees, we've seen money for universities go up by 28%, but it turns out its costing taxpayers more not less, and the truth is we're now in a position where almost half of students aren't repaying fees because they don't earn enough in their lifetime...there is a huge looming charge for taxpayers in the future.

'What I want is a solution which is fair for students, which doesn't stop students going to universities which protects the taxpayers and is also good for universities…the status quo is unsustainable, costly and hidden, George Osborne has played totally fast and loose with the public finances and we're going to expose that.'

The row comes after House of Commons figures revealed that the Government's decision to triple tuition fees will end up costing students and taxpayers more money – because half the loans will never be repaid.

Business Secretary Vince Cable said the Lib Dems had lost a lot of support after agreeing to increase tuition fees - but insisted it was 'worth it'

Ministers increased the cap on student fees from £3,000 to £9,000 a year to fill the hole in university funding left by government cuts to the higher education budget.

But, because student debs are written off after 30 years, 49.5 per cent will never be recouped, meaning the scheme will cost the government £2.5billion a year more than ministers claimed, House of Commons library figures show.

At the same time average graduate debts have doubled from £20,000 in 2010 to £43,500.

It comes after Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, revealed Labour would introduce a 'graduate tax' on the earnings of those who go to university to replace tuition fees.

Mr Umunna said the system would be 'fairer' than tuition fees and would be introduced 'in the medium term' if Labour returns to power.

The National Union of Students proposed an extra tax of between 0.3 per cent and 2.5 per cent of their income above £15,000, for a period of 20 years, with the highest earners paying higher rates.

Labour is struggling to work out how to pay for a pledge it has already made to slash university tuition fees from the current maximum of £9,000 a year to £6,000.

In 2011, it announced the policy as it sought to win over disaffected former Liberal Democrat voters angered by Nick Clegg reneging on a pledge to scrap fees and signing up to Coalition plans to allow institutions to charge up to £9,000 a year – triple the amount students paid previously.

The £6,000 cap is expected to be included in Labour's general election manifesto, but it is not clear how the party intends to meet such an expensive commitment.

Previously, Labour has suggested that it might pay for the cut with a corporation tax increase on banks or with higher rates of interest for better-off students.

The party may also be forced to restrict the cut in fees to certain types of courses such as technical degrees, leaving other students to keep on paying the current cost.

Mr Umunna, who is responsible for higher education policy, said introducing a full-scale graduate tax 'as soon as possible is my priority'. 

Ed Miliband's campaign chief Lucy Powell attacked the decision to increase tuition fees.

She said: 'Ed has long said that he thinks that the current system [of tuition fees] needs to change and a report out this morning, figures we've gained from the House of Commons library this morning show that the new funding arrangement, the increased tuition fees to £9,000 a year is actually costing the taxpayer more because half of those loans that people are having to take out won't be repaid.

'So we've got young people leaving university with £30,000, £40,000 worth of debt. Nearly half of them won't actually repay those loans so it's costing the taxpayer more anyway.'

The decision to hike tuition fees is one of the most controversial decisions of the Coalition.

Nick Clegg, appearing on the comedy show The Last Leg on Friday admitted it had given him sleepless nights.

However he also continued to defend the decision, adding: 'I'm not Prime Minister so I can't do what I want.'

The Lib Dems have pointed to figures showing the gap between the number of rich and poor students wanting to go on to higher education had fallen since 2010. 

Business Secretary Vince Cable has described the new system as 'better, affordable and fair'.

He said: 'We have paid a price for this policy more than any other party. But the success of these reforms, with more students from disadvantaged backgrounds applying to university than ever before, shows it was a price worth paying.

'Regardless of family circumstances, all students can now obtain university level education as long as they meet academic requirements. This is a good legacy.'

The figures, from university admissions service Ucas, show 21 per cent of 18-year-olds from disadvantaged backgrounds in England applied this year.

Overall, the richest 18-year-olds in the UK are 2.4 times more likely to want to go to university than the poorest. But in 2006, when Labour was in power, the wealthiest were 3.7 times more likely to want to apply.
