A Mexican man has been arrested after he allegedly kept the teenage daughters of his girlfriend captive for five years and fathered five children with one of the girls.

Jorge Iniestra Salas, a 32-year-old taxi driver, is also accused of beating one of the teenagers to death in 2009 and suffocating a three-month-old boy by forcing the baby to nurse on the dead girl's body.

Prosecutors said Salas kept the bodies at his mother's home in a slum of Mexico City for a month before he dumped them on a road in a neighbouring state with the help of a brother.

Mexico City's prosecutor for crimes against children said that authorities rescued another three-month-old boy who had been severely beaten and is in a critical condition in hospital.

The surviving sister, now 21, and her three other children, aged two, four and five, are being cared for by authorities.

The family were kept in a filthy room with planks covering the windows. Prosecutor Jorge Ferman said: 'This is an imprisonment story, a story of captivity.'

Police have also arrested Salas's mother, brothers and sisters and the girls' mother for covering up the abuse and not allowing them to escape.

Salas allegedly became fixated on the two girls after starting a relationship with their mother Claudia Tapia, a 44-year-old school janitor, in 2004.

Salas soon moved in with the family which also included a son who he forced to work and often beat with a belt for not bringing home enough money.

In a chilling parallel to Austrian Josef Fritzl, prosecutors said he then stopped the girls going to school, moved them into his mother's house and refused to let them outside in the Iztapalapa neighbourhood.

Tapia told reporters that Salas was manipulative and told her that he belonged to the middle-class and that men of that status could have several women living with them.

The part-time cab driver has been charged with homicide, kidnapping and child abuse. He faces up to 30 years in prison.

The girls' mother ultimately lodged a complaint with police that led to their rescue.

The attorney general's office says she was so terrorised that she gave her entire savings and her debit card to Salas.

Mr Mancera said that Tapia and her daughters were suffering from Stockholm Syndrome, when captives identify with their kidnappers.

They have allegedly defended Salas's behaviour during questioning by prosecutors.
