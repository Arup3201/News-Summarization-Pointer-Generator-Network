A hospital in Los Angeles has become the first in the world to live-tweet a brain surgery using Vine, Twitter's new way to share videos online.

Incredibly the footage shows the patient happily strumming away on his guitar while doctors operate.

Patient Brad Carter, 39, was filmed while surgeons placed a pacemaker implant in his brain yesterday to counteract the effects of Parkinson's disease. 

Not for the squeamish or faint-hearted, the tweets of the surgery are accompanied with video that shows each stage of the procedure in brief but graphic clips.

Preparation: Brad Carter, who was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease in 2006, talks about the songs he plans to play ahead of surgery to implant a pacemaker in his brain

Mr Carter was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease after he developed hand tremors in 2006 which caused him to lose the ability to play his guitar.

The operation involves stimulating an area of the brain and implanting a brain pacemaker to treat the condition and essential tremors.

Mr Carter was woken up for part of the procedure and asked to play his guitar to assist the doctors with placing electrodes into the correct position.

Getting started: UCLA tweeted this picture at the start of the operation next to the tag: 'Alright... here we go!'

Doctors broadcast the procedure to 
commemorate the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Centre's 500th deep brain 
stimulation operation.

In the incredible footage posted online, the
 musician can then be seen playing his beloved instrument once again, 
even singing along, as doctors finish placing electrodes in his brain.

Speaking to the camera, Mr Carter says: 'I'm excited to play this guitar. [These are] original tunes - one is called "Drunk again".'

The operation was filmed and live-tweeted to mark the 500th time the medical centre has performed the procedure.

The hospital live-tweeted explanations, videos and photographs of the entire process to Twitter users over the course of several hours on Thursday

Live tweets using Instagram showed Twitter users the instruments and gadgets  - such as this remote control - being used to restore Brad's ability to play the guitar

Staff updated followers with Instagram photos and short video clips alongside the hashtag #UCLAORLive.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a therapy for sufferers of Parkinson's disease, a degenerative condition estimated to affect around 127,000 Britons.

There is no cure for the condition but surgery such as this and medication can help alleviate symptoms including tremors, muscle stiffness, pain and very slow movement.

DBS involves inserting a pacemaker that emits electronic impulses to affected areas of the brain, which lessens tremor symptoms.

Here surgeons shows exactly how the procedure to implant a pacemaker was carried out to help control the patient's Parkinson's tremor

Awake: Mr Carter, who can be seen holding up a cup of water during the operation, was awakened during the surgery to assist doctors in placing the electrodes in the right place

At UCLA, the patient is kept 
conscious throughout surgery and is asked to perform tests so that 
surgeons can check the pacemaker is properly placed.

UCLA said it live-tweeted the 
surgery, which was overseen by Dr. Nader Pouratian, with the hope that 
it would help alleviate future patients' fear of the procedure.

Tweets posted included: 'Removing the skin and drilling through the skull for electrode placement' and 'Electrode is prepared for implantation. Patient is being woken up at this time'.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is the main type of surgery used to help alleviate the symptoms experienced when suffering with Parkinson’s.

The procedure is not a cure, but it can give patients better control of slow movement, stiffness and tremors.

It can also mean that the patients doesn’t need to take as much medication which in turn reduces the side-effects of strong drugs such as involuntary movement.

The long-term outcome of deep brain stimulation is very encouraging. It is thought that it will remain the main surgical therapy for Parkinson's for the next 30 years.

DBS involves inserting a pacemaker and leads that emit electronic impulses to the affected areas of the brain.

The majority of people with Parkinson's who have had deep brain stimulation are fitted with a device that contains a non-rechargeable battery.

On average, the battery lasts between 3 and 5 years depending on the stimulator settings, but some may last longer before a replacement is needed.

The areas of the brain stimulated are usually the thalymus, the globus pallidus and the subthalmic nucleaus.

A small electric current is sent through the leads to test how the person's symptoms respond to stimulation, to make sure they have been put in the right place.

The leads are connected to extensions that are tunnelled under the skin behind the ear and down the neck.

They are then connected to a neurostimulator (a pacemaker device), which is placed under the skin around the chest or stomach area.

The patient is usually kept conscious throughout surgery and is asked to perform tests so that surgeons can check the pacemaker is properly placed.

Once the wounds from surgery have healed, the device will be switched on and the electrodes will deliver high-frequency stimulation to the area of the brain that is targeted.

It may take several months to fully programme the stimulator and adjust Parkinson's medication to get the most benefit from this treatment.
