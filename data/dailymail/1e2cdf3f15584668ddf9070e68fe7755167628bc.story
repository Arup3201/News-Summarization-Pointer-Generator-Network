For many 18-year-olds,Thursday was a day of destiny, as thousands of students received their A-level results.

But few will have got news anything like as exciting as Mo Rukundo, of Ashton Sixth Form College, who has signed for LA Galaxy, and been given the chance to follow in the footsteps of David Beckham. 

Rukundo, 18, from  Oldham, will join the likes of Robbie Keane and Landon Donovan in Los Angeles and cannot wait to get started.

The youngster, who has played for Burnley and Manchester City youth teams, is set to face some of his footballing heroes, such as Frank Lampard, Thierry Henry and David Villa, who will all be playing in the MLS.

He also received further good news this week after gaining three A-levels, in drama, religious studies and PE, and he has secured a sports scholarship to study sport psychology at university in the US.
