Read his verdict on Flower's Boy Scouts 

And on 'Big Cheese' Matt Prior 

And the day Jonathan Trott told Prior to 'f*** off' 

Kevin Pietersen strenuously denies texting South African players tactical information on how to get Andrew Strauss out in the Textgate storm to have engulfed English cricket in 2012.

The scandal began Pietersen’s downfall as an England international and, he says, was a direct consequence of Strauss obnoxiously ignoring him after scoring a century.

Pietersen – whose explosive autobiography will ruffle feathers at the heart of the ECB – alleges that Strauss didn't acknowledge him after hitting 149 during the second Test in South Africa two years ago.

Kevin Pietersen has denied sending text messages on how to dismiss Andrew Strauss to friends in the South African team during the 'Textgate' scandal that engulfed English cricket in 2012

Pietersen alleges that Strauss didn't acknowledge him after hitting 149 against South Africa at Headingley 

That led to a friend in the South African side BlackBerry Messaging the batsman asking what his captain’s problem was.

‘He asked me, what was Strauss’ problem? He totally ignored the both of us. Made a point of it,’ Pietersen wrote. ‘I have never and would never give any tactical information about any teammates.’ He went on to brand that assertion as ‘b*******’.

The former England captain, who resigned after three Tests in 2009, also moves to set the record straight on the term ‘doos’ – thought to be Afrikaan for ‘c***’. 

He wrote that the friend called Strauss a ‘doos’, meaning a ‘d***’ or ‘idiot’, sentiments the 34-year-old agreed with.

Pietersen labels the episode as ‘bizarre’ and that it was leaked ‘drop by poisonous drop’ by an organisation to use the furore as an excuse to get shut of their leading run scorer.

He says that the ECB attempted to set him up, trying to coerce a denial before later moving to discredit and wield the axe, but did admit to making mistakes: 'I see now how it looked.' 

Strauss’ relationship with Pietersen is said to have taken a drastic turn for the worse just days into his captaincy. 

Described as ‘my buddy’ before the switch, Strauss’ refusal to allow time off to go home ‘at a really tough time in my life’ during a tour of the Caribbean saw the connection break down.
