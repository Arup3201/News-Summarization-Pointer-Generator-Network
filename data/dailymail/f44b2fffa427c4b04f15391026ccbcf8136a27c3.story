A mother gave her daughter three ecstasy tablets as a present for her 13th birthday, it emerged last night.

The woman was reported to social services after handing over the Class A drugs as a special prize for becoming a teenager.

It is understood the family, from Middlesbrough, are now being monitored by social workers – although the mother was not prosecuted.

Tough ex-detective Ray Mallon, formerly known as RoboCop, has spoken out about problem families in Middlesbrough, where he leads the council

The  case was exposed by the town’s mayor, Ray Mallon, in a bid to highlight widespread social problems.

Mr Mallon said it was just one example
of the terrible parenting he had encountered, and added that such 
incidents led him to ‘despair’.

Social problems blamed on bad parenting are placing a huge strain on council budgets, with many children being taken into care.

One family with six children in care is costing Middlesbrough Council more than half a million pounds a year.

He claimed he knew of one nother who gave her daughter three ecstasy tablets for her 13th birthday present

Mr Mallon, a former policeman who 
earned  the nickname ‘Robocop’, said: ‘No one wants to take children 
into care, but when we have parents whose own upbringing makes them feel
giving their children drugs is acceptable, we sometimes have little 
choice.’

He said one household was costing the public purse £600,000 a year.

Mr
Mallon said children should be targeted 'in the womb' to stop problems,
as he claimed that they were being let down by parents who abused 
alcohol and drugs.

Mr Mallon, who has been elected Middlesbrough's mayor three times, said there were 360 children in care in the town.

He highlighted the case when speaking to BBC's Look North about hundreds of troubled families being supported on Teesside.

He told the BBC as an ex-police officer, he often recognised the same family names getting involved in crime. 

He said  we should target children whilst they're in the womb 'because it's clear that you can work out by the parents which kids are likely to have problems.'

The Government has set up the Troubled Families programme so authorities and their partners can help 120,000 households in England turn their lives around by 2015.

The scheme will see councils receive funding if they tackle problems such as truancy, anti-social behaviour and youth crime.

Mr Mallon was heralded by politicians in the late 1990s when he adopted a zero tolerance stance against crime while a detective superintendent with Cleveland Police.

He was elected on an independent ticket in 2002, and will stand down in 2015.

He has also said today that of the borough’s 23 wards 16 were socially deprived - one of the biggest challenges facing the town right now.

He said for every 16 children taken into care it costs the council £1.2m.
