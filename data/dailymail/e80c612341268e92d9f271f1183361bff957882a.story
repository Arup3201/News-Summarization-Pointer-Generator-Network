Suspended hundreds of feet in the air amid glistening pillars of ice illuminated with ghostly lights from below, this could easily be a computer-generated scene from the latest sci-fi blockbuster movie.

But in fact these ethereal photographs were taken in real life, and show extreme sportsman and climber Stephan Siegrist, 43, ascending the Voringsfossen icefall which is part of a gigantic glacier in Eidfjord, Norway.

The stunning images were captured by fellow mountaineer and photographer Thomas Senf. While the 500ft frozen waterfall is regularly scaled by climbers during daylight, he said he wanted to capture the beauty of the falls by night.

Spot the climber: Stephan Siegrist, 43, scales the Voringsfossen icefall, a 500ft-tall frozen waterfall that forms part of a glacier in Norway

There he is: While hundreds of climbers attempt to scale the fall during the day, few attempt it at night. With bright lights illuminating his efforts from below, Mr Siegrist appears to be on the set of a sci-fi movie

Stunning: Mr Siegrist (pictured) trained as an apprentice carpenter before falling in love with mountaineering during a ski trip as a teenager. He gave up woodwork aged 26, and has earned his living from climbing ever since

He said: 'Photography and filming at night is a big challenge because of the lighting. The ways to play with the factors of light, time and environment fascinate me endlessly.

'I had considered for a long time how to work with artificial light, which is normally only possible in a photo studio, in major mountains.

'The transparency and reflective properties of ice in the sun had often caught my eye. With its virtually unlimited number of icefalls, Norway seemed like the perfect place to put those ideas into practice.'

Climber Mr Siegrist was born in Meikirch, Switzerland, near to Bern, which is within sight of the northern Alps. While he trained as a carpenter, he fell in love with mountaineering after a skiing trip as a teenager.

Out of this world: Mr Senf (pictured bottom right in both images) was primarily a climber in the early stages of his career, but began to incorporate photography into his adventures, and took these images during one trip in 2012

Frozen solid: For a large part of the year the Voringsfossen icefall is liquid, but during the winter months the bitterly cold air freezes it solid, allowing climbers to attempt to scale it

Aged 26 he gave up woodwork, became a professional mountain guide, and has made a living from climbing ever since. Over the course of a near 20-year career he has racked up hundreds of climbing hours, making first ascents on all seven continents.

As well as ice climbing, as demonstrated in these photographs, he also specialises in big-wall climbing - scaling sheer rock faces that usually require more than one day to ascend - and bouldering - climbing without the use of safety harnesses or ropes.

Meanwhile photographer Mr Senf qualified in mechanical engineering, but moved to Switzerland aged 21 to pursue his passion for mountaineering.

Starting out purely as a climber, he and a group of friends made two first ascents of peaks in the Himalayas, before he began incorporating photography into his adventures.

He captured these stunning images of Mr Siegrist during a trip to Norway in 2012. He added: 'During the summer months, water tumbles from the cliff tops. Come winter, this majestic landscape is transformed as the waters are suspended mid-flow creating icefalls.

'Climbers frequently scale them during daylight hours, but we wanted to capture their full beauty and colour at night.'
