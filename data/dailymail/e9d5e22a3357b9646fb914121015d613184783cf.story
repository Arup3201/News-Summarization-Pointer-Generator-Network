Gerard Depardieu, 64, did not turn up to court in Paris today because he was filming in New York

French film star Gerard Depardieu will find out today if he is going to jail for crashing his scooter while drunk - but he didn't bother turning up to court to hear his fate.

The 64-year-old actor, who also failed to attend court for the last hearing in January, was more than three times over the drink-drive limit when he came off his moped near the Champs-Elysees in Paris last November.

Today he was due to attend a 'correctional tribunal' in Paris to face a charge of drink-driving, but he did not turn up because he was in New York filming his new role as Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the shamed former boss of the International Monetary Fund.

A judge said the case would go ahead in Depardieu's absence, and the Oscar-nominated star of Green Card and Cyrano de Bergerac risked being sentenced to a maximum of two years behind bars and a £3,500 (Euro 4,500) fine.

Depardieu, who has courted controversy in his native France after moving to Belgium and taking Russian citizenship to avoid a new 75 per cent tax rate, was held in custody for five hours until he had sobered up after the incident on November 29.

Police tested his breath at the scene and found he had a blood alcohol level of 1.8g per litre - well over the 0.5g per litre legal limit.

The Oscar-nominated star failed to appear at his first court appearance in January because he was discussing a new film project in Montenegro.  He is now making that film, hence his non-appearance today.

Today's court hearing is the latest in a catalogue of drink-related incidents involving the star - who once admitted to drinking up to six bottles of wine a day.

Last August, Depardieu was quizzed by police for punching a driver who collided with his scooter on a Paris street.

The actor, seen here leaving the Tribeca Grill restaurant in New York yesterday, is currently filming in the U.S.

The man made an official complaint for asssault but charges were later dropped.

Two years ago, Depardieu was also arrested for smashing up a car parked outside a swingers' club near his Paris home.

And he was involved in a separate scandal in France in 2011 when he urinated in the aisle of a plane in full view of disgusted passengers.

Horrified travellers told how the actor called out 'I need to p***' as the City Jet flight from Paris to Dublin was preparing for take-off.

After a stewardess barred him from using the loo, he unzipped his flies and soaked the carpet, before cabin crew ordered him off the plane.

He later apologised for the 'humiliating incident' which he blamed on prostate problems, and admitted that he could 'often behave like a complete a***hole' in public.

When Depardieu announced his plans to move abroad to avoid paying high tax rates, he was branded 'shabby and unpatriotic' by prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault.

The defiant screen legend retaliated by declaring he would also hand back his French passport, and wrote an angry open letter to the French government, saying: 'All those who have left France have not been insulted as I have been.'

He then told French president Francois Hollande in a personal phone call that he was 'sickened at how France spits on success'.

Depardieu is one of the few French stars known throughout the world, and has made more than 100 films, many in English.

He also notorious in France for his battle with alcohol and his turbulent love life.

Over the past ten years he has devoted much of his time to producing wine at his Lys-de-Volan vineyard near Lyon.
