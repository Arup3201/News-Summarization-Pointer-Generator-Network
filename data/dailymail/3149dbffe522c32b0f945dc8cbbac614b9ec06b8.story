A police officer has been shot with a sawn-off shotgun while searching for an armed criminal in a New Zealand supermarket car park.

New Zealand police have confirmed that the officer was shot while he and two other dog handlers were trying to apprehend a 35-year-old man driving a stolen van, in Hamilton on the North Island.

The offender was also seriously injured when the gun fired.

Superintendent Bruce Bird said the handlers had followed a fleeing driver seen in the suburb of Nawton about 11.30am on Monday.

The police officers and dog handlers had followed the stolen car to the Pak'n Save car park where the perpetrator had confronted a woman to steal her car.

Superintendent Bird said they had made an attempt to take the offender to the ground.

'A firearm, believed to be a sawn-off shotgun, being held by the offender has then gone off seriously injuring the offender and also wounding one of the officers.

'Neither injury is considered to be life threatening and both the offender and the injured officer are currently undergoing medical treatment.'

Around thirty police, reportedly armed, cordoned off the area and escorted shoppers out of the Pak'n Save on Mill Street in Hamilton, on New Zealandâ€™s North Island.

Hamilton Police confirmed the incident was linked to another armed incident in Kihikihi near the coast of the North Island.

A photograph from the scene shows a shotgun on the tarmac.

Witnesses told the NZ Herald that the police officer was shot either in the leg or the foot.

Meanwhile officers are appealing for anyone who witnessed what occurred at the supermarket car park to contact the Hamilton Police on 07 8586200.
