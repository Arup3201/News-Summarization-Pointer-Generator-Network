When Emma Salisbury learned her four-year-old son Tommy had an incurable condition which would cause him slowly to go blind, she held him close and wept, grieving for the sight he would lose, imagining his life in a blanket of darkness.

And then she decided to try to save him.

Emma well knew how devastating the condition - choroideremia - could be, as it had left her grandfather blind at 39.

She tracked down a scientist at Imperial College in London who was carrying out research on mice in the hope of one day developing a treatment.

'My husband Paul and I went to see him,' says Emma. 'Afterwards, we looked at each other and said: “He's not going to stop until there's a cure. We've got to help him.” '

They decided to raise money to help with the research. It started in 2005 with a coffee morning, and quickly built up to golf days, school discos, marathons and bike rides. Eight years on, Emma has so far raised the staggering sum of £300,000.

The result? In October 2010, the world's first clinical trial for a treatment for choroideremia began. It's no exaggeration to say the trial was only possible because of Emma's contributions.

Robert Maclaren, professor of ophthalmology at the University of Oxford, who is leading the two-year trial, says Emma's fundraising is 'the single most significant factor that enabled our team of researchers to lead the world in starting the first clinical trial for this disease'.

The results of the trial will be published next month, and Emma has met some of the participants. 'All of them have had an improvement,' she says. 'One man who used only to be able to read 17 letters at a time can now read 37. Another, who has lost night vision, said he can see the stars again.'

Emma knows it may be five years before the treatment becomes available to help Tommy, now 13 - as the team must do more studies and monitor the participants to ensure the treatment is effective and safe.

'But it's hugely encouraging,' she says.

Choroideremia is a genetic condition that causes the degeneration of the choroid. This layer of blood vessels at the back of the eye provides oxygen for the retina, which converts beams of light into images, allowing a person to see.

The first symptom is night blindness, or being unable to see in dark surroundings, which tends to start in childhood.

Next the sufferer loses peripheral vision, and then central vision. The rate at which choroideremia progresses varies - Emma's grandfather wasn't diagnosed until his 20s.

The condition is passed down through a faulty gene on the  X chromosome. Women have two X chromosomes, so if they carry the faulty gene they will have a healthy version of the gene on their other X chromosome, protecting them from developing it.

That's why only men, who have just one X chromosome, develop it if they have the faulty gene.

Emma's first child was a girl, Amelia, then Tommy arrived two years later. The couple have since had another son, Johnny, now three. Emma knew she carried the faulty gene since she was tested aged seven. She and Paul, a builder, always knew that if they had a son, he would have a 50 per cent chance of having choroideremia.

'I've met parents who've said if they'd known they carried this gene they wouldn't have gone through with the pregnancy, but I don't understand that thinking,' says Emma, 41, who works for a private equity company and lives with her family in Welling, Kent.

'We'd never want to change Tommy - he's our child.'

After Tommy's birth, she took him to Moorfields Eye Hospital in London to see if he was at risk.

'The specialist told me to get him tested a bit later,' she says. 'At that point there was no sign of a cure and he said waiting a while  wouldn't make any difference.'

In February 2005, when Tommy was four, she went back to the specialist, who broke the awful news that Tommy had the condition.

'We burst into tears - me, Paul, and my mum. Even though there were no signs of problems, we went through six months of grieving for the sight he'd lose.

'Sometimes I'd stand there with my eyes closed and think, is this what it's going to be like for him?'

From the start, she and Paul decided to talk to Tommy openly about his condition.

'What's
 phenomenal is this isn't major donors writing enormous cheques. This is
 hard-slogging fundraising - cake sales, coffee mornings, friends and 
family pulling together to raise tiny amounts, bit by bit. [Emma is] an 
inspiration to us at the charity.'

'We told him his eyes were different from everybody else's, and when he was older they wouldn't work as well,' she says.

'His friends have been great. When they go on school journeys, where there's camping and night-time activities, they say: “Don't worry, we'll look after him.” '

But she admits that watching Tommy grow up and start to understand has, at times, been unbearably sad.

'When he was about seven, one night I heard him crying,' says Emma. 'I sat on his bed and he said: “Will I go blind one day?”

'I explained this was why we were raising money. And that it wouldn't happen until he was much older. 'He said, “OK, that's all right then,” rolled over and went to sleep. It was heartbreaking, but made me more determined to carry on.'

Emma admits that when she and her mother Dot Grindley set up the Tommy Salisbury Choroideremia Fund in 2005, she never expected to raise as much money.

'But everywhere I went, people wanted to do something, and suddenly I was raising £60,000 a year.'

Michele Acton, chief executive of the charity Fight For Sight, which helps Emma run her fund, says she is 'astounded' at the amount she's raised. 'Very few people could do what she has done,' she adds.

'What's phenomenal is this isn't major donors writing enormous cheques. This is hard-slogging fundraising - cake sales, coffee mornings, friends and family pulling together to raise tiny amounts, bit by bit. She's an inspiration to us at the charity.'

Young promise: Tommy, aged four, the age at which he and his family learned of his condition

Emma has also become a great support for many other parents she has met who are affected by choroideremia.

'The hardest thing is hearing from parents whose child has just been diagnosed, because it brings all those memories back.'

The biggest reward has been the start of the clinical trial. With the help of Emma's money, the researchers at Imperial discovered that in patients with choroideremia, when the cells of the choroid and retina die, they do not regenerate as they should.

This has led to the development of a treatment injecting the eye with cells cultured from genes found in a healthy eye - the subject of the current trial (funded in part by the Department of Health).

None of this would have happened without Emma.

Phenomenal: Emma has raised the staggering sum of £300,000 to fund research on a cure for choroideremia

As Professor Maclaren explains: 'The problem with very rare diseases is they tend to not get funding for research. While choroideremia is rare, it's devastating for those who have it. What's more, the technology we're developing is relevant to other causes of blindness, including age-related macular degeneration.'

Emma says while her primary aim was to help her son, everything she does 'will help other families with choroideremia around the world'.

'People tell me I must be so excited, but I won't be until Tommy has his first appointment to have it,' says Emma.

'He's told me how proud he is of everything we're doing.'

For now, Tommy is a normal, happy teenage boy.

'Sometimes I feel anxious about him,' says Emma. 'I think how he might be if he can't play football any more, or if he's not able to drive. But I look on the bright side and hope some of that attitude rubs off on Tommy.

'What has happened is tragic for Tommy and for us, but we're so grateful for what we have. Tommy can walk, he can talk and he can lead a full, happy life.'

She and Paul have not yet had their younger son, Johnny, tested for the faulty gene, but plan to when he is approaching five.

'At the moment, I don't think I could handle it,' Emma says.
