William Sword Jr. who was crushed to death by a tree felled by Sandy

An
investment banker who survived a brutal stabbing at his home in 2003 has been
crushed to death by a tree outside his home as Hurricane Sandy’s vicious winds
approached.

William Sword Jr., 61, a married father-of-three, was struck by the tree as he
cleared debris from his driveway on Great Road in Princeton, New Jersey at
8.30pm on Monday.

Princeton First Aid and Rescue Squad attempted to revive him as he lay trapped,
but he was pronounced dead at the scene, police said.

The freak accident came nearly a decade after Sword, the managing director of a
New Jersey-based investment bank founded by his father, survived being stabbed
after answering the door to a distressed stranger at his home, the Times of
Trenton reported.

Jelani Manigaul, a 24-year-old senior at the University of Maryland, smashed
his car into a tree near the home in January 23, 2003, just 24 hours after he
told a psychiatrist he believed he was having a breakdown.

He entered the house, stabbed Sword in his upper chest and shoulder before he
was smacked across the head with a frying pan, reports noted.

Stumbling from the house, Manigault came face-to-face with police responding to
the 911 call from Sword’s wife. He reportedly slit his wrists twice before
saying ‘kill me’ and refusing to drop the knife.

He was fatally shot by police.

Sword, who suffered a collapsed lung, underwent surgery and fully recovered.

Yet it left him with a renewed zest for life and more appreciative of time
spent with his family, including his wife Martha and their three children,
Gretchen, Hope and Will, friends told Businessweek.

‘He was a very well-respected, well-connected guy, an old- school gentleman in
every sense of the word,’ Sword’s colleague, Daniel B. Rowe, added.

‘He was a righteous person who was very charitable. He’s literally got dozens
of friends and business colleagues who have reached out to me and the firm
since they heard.’

Sword graduated from Princeton University, where he majored in politics, in
1976 and joined William Sword & Co., which he went onto head in 1981.

The firm had been launched by his father, William Sword, who helped start
Morgan Stanley’s mergers and acquisitions department in the 1970s before
leaving to create his own firm. He died in 2005.
