'I want to grieve': Louise Troh, 54, was confined when she learned her fiance Thomas Eric Duncan had died of Ebola on October 8 - but is now free

The first 48 people to be quarantined in the wake of Ebola landing in the US have now been given the all-clear after showing no symptoms of the deadly disease.

All 48 were sealed off from contact with other humans after it was revealed that Thomas Eric Duncan, the first man to be diagnosed with the virus on U.S. soil, had come into contact with them.

Among the group are Louise Troh, Duncan's fiancée, and her children, and friends and family members who has been kept under armed guard at a secret location in Dallas. 

Most of the others were health workers who had contact with Duncan when he arrived at Texas Health Presbyterian hospital in Dallas on the day he was diagnosed with Ebola, sparking fears across the country that the virus would spread.

When the clock struck 10pm on Sunday night, it marked three weeks from the date that Duncan was finally admitted to the hospital. Everyone who came into contact with him before that is now in the clear.  

Since Duncan died on October 8, two more people have contracted Ebola.

Nurses Nina Pham, 26, and Amber Vinson, 29, were both involved with caring for Duncan and are now themselves being treated in isolation units in hospitals.

Federal officials are meanwhile ramping up readiness to deal with future cases.

A top government official said revised guidance instructs health workers treating Ebola patients to wear protective gear 'with no skin showing.' The Pentagon said it is forming a team to support civilian medical staff in the U.S.

In Dallas, Louise Troh and several friends and family members are now free to leave a stranger's home where they have been confined under armed guard for 21 days — the maximum incubation period for Ebola.

Troh said: 'I want to breathe, I want to really grieve, I want privacy with my family'.

She added: 'Even though the quarantine is over, our time of mourning is not over. Because of that, we ask to be given privacy as we seek to rebuild our home, our family and our daily living. We will not give any interviews at this time. I do have a story to tell, and I look forward to telling it in my own way at the right time.'

She added: 'Our hearts also go out to the two brave women who have been infected by this terrible disease as they were trying to help him. We are also aware of how much this has affected many other people of my city, Dallas, and my country, the United States of America, even as it has in the country of my birth, Liberia.'

'Patient zero': The 48 were quarantined because of their contact with Thomas Eric Duncan, who was diagnosed with Ebola in Texas and became the first person to die of the disease in the U.S.

She emerges from quarantine with 'nothing.'  

During the frantic operation to seal off her apartment where Duncan stayed in Dallas and eliminate all traces of the disease, she also lost the majority of her belongings.

Only a few personal documents, some photographs, and a single Bible escaped the cleansing operation.

'They were left with nothing. They are completely devastated by this, so there's need to have their lives rebuilt,' her pastor George Mason said. 

Troh described Dallas health care workers and officials as 'angels from God' for the way they cared for her and her family during their three-week quarantine, ABC News reported.

She added that she hoped 'that God will bring healing to all in our community soon,' but said that as happy as she and her family are that their ordeal is coming to an end, 'our happiness is mixed with sadness'.

The incubation period also hasange passed for about a dozen health workers who encountered Duncan when he went to the Dallas hospital for the first time, on September 25.

Duncan was sent home but returned by ambulance on September 28 and was admitted. Pham and Vinson followed later.

Vinson's family issued a statement Sunday saying they have hired a lawyer and are troubled by comments and media coverage that 'mischaracterize' Vinson, who is being treated at Emory University in Atlanta.

Vinson 'has not and would not knowingly expose herself or anyone else,' the statement says.

Dallas County and federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials cleared her to fly last week to Dallas from Ohio, and 'suggestions that she ignored any of the physician and government-provided protocols recommended to her are patently untrue and hurtful,' the family says.

Every day, the Ebola sufferers in the United States and their caregivers produce an astonishing eight 55-gallon barrels of medical waste PER DAY.

Masks, gloves, linens, utensils, medical instruments--everything the patient contacts must be destroyed and the garbage is piling up.

While one surefire way to destroy the pathogen is to incinerate the waste, some states have already said 'no way' to requests they accept the tainted garbage.

Missouri's attorney general has even made moves to bar Ebola-contaminated waste from being destroyed at a St. Louis facility, reports the LA Times.

Earlier this month, a Louisiana waste disposal site refused to accept the ashes generated when a Thomas Eric Duncan's belongings from his apartment were incinerated and a judge even signed an order temporarily blocking the disposal in the state.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Thomas Frieden said during a news conference that the virus is not considered to be hardy in the environment and that incineration and chemical treatment of the infected waste is sufficient to remove any risk.

On Sunday, a Carnival Cruise Lines ship returned to Galveston, Texas, from a seven-day trip marred by worries over a health worker on board who was being monitored for Ebola. The lab supervisor had handled a specimen from Duncan and isolated herself on the ship as a precaution.

About 4,000 passengers on the cruise had to miss a stop in Cozumel, Mexico, where the boat was not allowed to dock because of the scare. Carnival said it was informed by U.S. health authorities Sunday morning that the worker tested negative for Ebola.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said those caring for Duncan were vulnerable because some of their skin was exposed.

The CDC is working on revisions to safety protocols. Earlier ones, Fauci said, were based on a World Health Organization model for care in remote places, often outdoors, and without intensive training for health workers.

'So there were parts about that protocol that left vulnerability, parts of the skin that were open,' Fauci said.

Health officials had previously allowed hospitals some flexibility to use available covering when dealing with suspected Ebola patients.

The new guidelines are expected to set firmer standards: calling for full-body suits and hoods that protect worker's necks; setting rigorous rules for removal of equipment and disinfection of hands; and requiring a 'site manager' to supervise the putting on and taking off of equipment.

Epicenter: Duncan went to Texas Health Presbyterian hospital in Dallas when he was suffering from Ebola. Many of those quarantined were health workers who dealt with him

The guidelines also are expected to require a 'buddy system' in which workers check each other as they come in and go out, according to an official who was familiar with the guidelines but not authorized to discuss them before their release.

Hospital workers also will be expected to exhaustively practice getting in and out of the equipment, the official said.

Nurses have been clamoring for more guidance and better garb, saying they have never cared for Ebola patients before and feel unprepared and underequipped.

'If hospital administrators had to take care of Ebola patients, they would have the gold standard and hazmat suits,' said RoseAnn DeMoro, executive director of National Nurses United, a union with 185,000 members.

In some places where they have the suits, nurses have not practiced taking them on and off.

'The hospital is sending them essentially a link to the CDC website. That's not preparation. That's like a do-it-yourself manual,' DeMoro said.

On Sunday the Pentagon announced that Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel had ordered the formation of a 30-person military support team to assist civilian medical professionals in the U.S. to treat Ebola.

The team will be formed by Northern Command's Commander, Gen. Chuck Jacoby, and will comprise 20 critical care nurses, five doctors trained in infectious disease and five trainers in infectious disease protocols. Once formed, the team will undergo up to a week of specialized training in infection control and personal protective equipment at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas, then remain in 'prepare to deploy' status for 30 days.

The team won't be sent overseas, and will 'be called upon domestically only if deemed prudent by our public health professionals,' Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said in a statement.
