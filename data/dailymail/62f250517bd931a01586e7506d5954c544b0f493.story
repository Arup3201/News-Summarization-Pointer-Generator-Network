When, eighty-five years ago, 21-year-old Kathleen Thomas declared her intention to swim the treacherous Bristol Channel between Wales and England, the world thought she was mad.

The distance is 11 miles as the crow flies - but more often calculated as 22-and-a-half once the water's brutal currents are taken into account.

The stretch of water which links 
Penarth to Weston-super-Mare had a fearsome reputation due to its lethal tides, caused by scattered headlands and islands funnelling enormous volumes of tidal water through small spaces. Many men had attempted the challenge and failed.

And then, just two years later, in 1929, a 16-year-old 
schoolgirl named Edith Parnell declared she would emulate Kathleen and try her hand at the same perilous swim.

Remarkably, both of these women succeeded in their challenge, and Kathleen became the first swimmer to ever complete the task, remaining in the Guinness Boook of Records until the 1990s.

Now a fellow wild-swimmer, Catherine Jones, has paid tribute to these two extraordinary athletes who were dismissed by locals at the time as 'mere women' who would never have the strength or stamina to go the distance.

Jones has written a book, The Wonder Girls, published by Simon & Schuster, to tell the oft-forgotten  story of these pioneering 'lady swimmers' of the 1920s, who defied convention - in an age when the expectation for women was simply marriage and motherhood - with ambition.

Recounting the day when Kathleen completed the challenge, Ms Jones said: 'At 4.15am on September 5, 1927, Kathleen Thomas stood on the beach at Penarth, a small seaside town just outside Cardiff, in a black Wolsey bathing costume and submarine cap, intent on swimming from South Wales to Somerset.

'The Suffragettes were campaigning for women’s rights, but nobody thought a girl could cross to the other side - many men had tried and failed.'

Critics said a 'mere woman' should never attempt such a feat. In fact, following their story announcing Kathleen’s intention, the local newspaper had been obliged to print the following clarification because no one believed the original article: 'Miss Kathleen Thomas, the Penarth lady swimmer, whose decision to attempt the Bristol Channel was exclusively reported in yesterday’s South Wales Echo, reaffirmed in an interview today that our report was correct in its entirety.'

Ms Jones continued: 'Crowds lined the beach to watch Kathleen wade into the chill grey waters, accompanied by a launch containing representatives from the Welsh Amateur Swimming Association and a rowing boat carrying her uncle Jack in a bowler hat.

'Seven hours and 20 minutes later she reached the shores of Somerset; fortified by beef tea and chocolate, Thomas received a rapturous welcome from the West Country. She was the first person, as well as the first woman, to swim the Bristol Channel.

'Compelling images from newspapers of the time show her exhausted, slumped in a boat, before she was taken to a hotel where she had a warm and cold bath, a half-hour rest in bed, and a good fish lunch before returning to Wales a celebrity.'

Two years later a plucky teenager named Edith Parnell took 10 hours, 17 minutes and 10 seconds to make the crossing, becoming the second person to successfully swim the channel.

When she arrived at the finish line in Penarth a police constable escorted her 
through cheering crowds to the tune of 'See the Conquering Hero Comes'.

Ms Jones continued: 'At a reception in the Pier Pavilion, the council's chairman told the 
audience they were especially proud of Miss Parnell who had displayed "amazing pluck in enduring for over ten hours one of the biggest trials 
that could be demanded of any athlete, man or woman".'

Though locals at the time campaigned for monuments of remembrance after the women had completed their challenges, it was not until 2007 was Kathleen's achievement was marked by a plaque on Penarth seafront.

After Kathleen's triumph, a letter from a person named J. Mitchell was 
printed in the local newspaper, suggesting the town needed 'something to 
commemorate this great achievement that generations yet to come may know
about it'.

J. Mitchell named Kathleen 'a splendid descendant of the old
British pluck, daring and the unquenchable spirit which enabled our 
ancestors to do such deeds which made our nation the greatest the world 
had ever seen.'

Edith went on to marry Hugh Cudlipp, later Lord Cudlipp, the Fleet 
Street journalist and editor famous for his work on the Daily Mirror, but 
in 1935 she died giving birth.
