Jaine Stanley, 4, was diagnosed with severe scoliosis of the spine at the age of two

A girl with a 63-degree bend in her spine is now a step closer to her dream of becoming a gymnast after a pioneering operation to straighten her back using remote controlled magnetic rods. 

Jaine Stanley, 4, was diagnosed with severe scoliosis of the spine at the age of two and forced to wear restrictive and uncomfortable plastic braces for 23 hours a day to support her back.

The painful condition meant she could only sit on the sidelines as her friends played and could not even sit on the sofa because her tight braces got in the way.

Instead she would sit on the living room floor of her home in Newport, Isle of Wight, where she was first mesmerised by gymnasts on television and began to dream of joining them one day.

Yet, as her spine continued to curve into a shocking 63 degree bend - the worst case her spinal surgeon had ever seen - her ambition seemed further away than ever.

But now the budding gymnast is a giant step closer to her goal - and an incredible four centimetres taller - after a pioneering operation to straighten her spine.

Jaine had the life-changing seven-and-a-half hour operation in October and was the first - and youngest - patient to have the surgery at Southampton Children's Hospital, Hampshire.

The MAGEC rods brace the spine to minimise the growth of scoliosis and are lengthened over time using an external remote control.

This is placed on top of the skin and triggers a magnetic motor inside the rods to cause them to grow.

The process, first introduced in 2009 and now NHS England's recommended practice, replaces the need to operate to manually lengthen the growing rods every six to nine months.

Jaine will next return to the hospital every 12 weeks, when her rods can be lengthened within just minutes during a routine outpatient appointment.

She will have her first follow up appointment later this month and hopes to start gymnastics lessons in the coming months.

Jaine's mother Berenice, 42, said: 'The difference in Jaine is already amazing.

'We couldn't believe it when she came out of the operation four centimetres taller - in less than eight hours.

'We've taken her swimming since the operation and she was over the moon that she could finally touch the floor of the pool.

'She has always been so positive and despite the discomfort she felt with her braces, she just got on with things the best she could.

'She'd put the braces on her teddy bears when she wasn't wearing them. But it was horrible to see her missing out on bouncy castles or soft play parties and struggling in the summer as she got hot and uncomfortable.

'It's still early days so we are taking it slowly but now she's set her sights on becoming a gymnast. She keeps talking about getting a leotard. It's lovely to see her so happy.'

Mrs Stanley began to have concerns about Jaine when she was two and a family friend pointed out that her body did not look 'straight'.

The mother-of-eight, who owns a burger van with partner Myles, 47, said: 'When Jaine got to about two years old we noticed that she didn't look straight and her body was going off to the side.

'It was concerning so we took her for an x-ray and she became the youngest child on the island to be diagosed with scoliosis.'

Jaine had to be fitted with for four different braces over the next two years, which she had to wear for 23 hours a day.

The tube-shaped plastic frames encased her torso and works to support Jaine's spine, but they had to be fastened tightly to be effective.

Her mother said: 'She had to wear the brace all day and it would dig into her armpits and make her very hot in the summer.

Scoliosis is a condition that causes the spine to curve to the left or right. While it is usually mild and doesn't require treatment, severe cases such as Jaine's require back braces or surgery.

The word itself comes from the Greek word meaning crooked - and it can form in either the upper or lower spine.

It generally starts during puberty and begins gradually and painlessly. But if it is severe, it can become disfiguring as the bending spine contorts nearby muscles, vertebrae and ligaments.

If not treated properly, it can cause back pain, breathing and heart problems later in life.

'She would flip it off her body when she was asleep and give it to her teddies to wear when she was having a break. It supported her completely for 23 hours of the day and when she took it off, her spine would curve back around again.

'It was so hard for her because she couldn't play with her friends or join in on the bouncy castles at parties, but she stuck with it and got on the best she could.'

The life-changing surgery was carried out by Consultant Orthopaedic Adult and Paediatric Spinal Surgeon Christopher Dare.

Mr Dare said: 'Jaine's curvature was certainly the worst case of early onset scoliosis I've ever seen.

'I've never have I seen it progress quite so rapidly and to that sort of size, because we do try to stop it getting so bad with the use of braces but it was relentless in this case.

'The braces press on the rib cage externally to try to manipulate the spine into a straight position and hold it there while it grows.

'Often the bones are too small to operate on at that age and so the braces hold things in place until the child is old enough for us to operate.

'However, with Jaine it was clear - with a 63 degree bend - that we were losing the battle against the scoliosis with the braces and so the external pressure wasn't working and we needed to operate to fit the internal rods.

Jaine is now looking forward to fulfilling her ambition of becoming a gymnast - something she was unable to do before undergoing the operation

Jaine's mother Berenice Stanley said she began to have concerns about her daughter when she was two and a family friend pointed out that her body did not look 'straight'

'Historically, we used screw in rods which we would have to operate every six to nine months to stretch the rods out under general anaesthetic.

'The advantages of the rods is they have a magnetic motor built into the rod, which is driven by an externally applied magnet.

'So rather than have the operation to stretch the rods, we can place a magnetic motor on the skin and use that to stretch the rods, without exposing the rods and risking infection.'

He added: 'Jaine will have that lengthening procedure every three months until she is eight or nine.

'A scoliotic spine does not grow like a normal spine, so we are trying to achieve as much longitudinal growth of the spine as possible.

'We will lengthen the spine for as long as we can, usually until a child is 11 or 12, and when it is unlikely to grow any more we will then do a final spinal fusion to fix it into a fixed position.'
