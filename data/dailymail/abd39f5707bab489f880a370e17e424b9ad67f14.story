Despite a lack of demand from the American public for electric cars, the federal government gave a California company more than $100million in taxpayer money to establish a network of car-charging stations that is plagued by multiple problems, a government audit revealed.

The company is San Francisco-based ECOtality, which recently named Brandon Hurlbut - one-time chief of staff to former Energy Secretary Steven Chu - to its board of directors.

'I’m a political beast,' ECOtality's then-president, Jonathan Read, said on a 
2007 shareholder conference call. 'Playing the political card is 
something that when the time is right we’re going to play very hard.'

In 2009, it seems the time was right - ECOtality was given a $99.8million federal grant to install roughly 15,000 electric vehicle charging stations throughout the country.

The company also received $35 million from the department’s Vehicle Technologies Program from 2005
to 2011, “for two multiyear projects to evaluate and test specific 
vehicles.”

All of this comes as President Barack Obama has pledged to get one million electric cars on American roads by 2015 - a lofty goal in a country that has repeatedly shown its disdain for electric vehicles.

According to the Inspector General’s report, first obtained by Fox News, 'ECOtality was required to kick in a minimum of 20 percent of cost sharing under the $35 million in grants, and under the $100 million award, it was to match the taxpayer subsidy. But the DOE allowed ECOtality to use monthly costs of car owners and other expenses it did not directly incur to leverage the federal funds. That meant the company took on little risk in return for its subsidies, the report said.'

'Although there is no clear legislative history on the meaning behind requiring recipients to provide cost-share, the concept is generally understood to mitigate risk, help leverage federal investments, and ensure that recipients have some ‘skin in the game’ in these kinds of transactions,' the IG report said.

The company had planned to begin installing charging stations in five metro areas to alleviate one of the biggest issues Americans have with electric cars: 'range anxiety' - the fear amongst consumers that charging electric cars will be too difficult because of a lack of charging stations.

The goal, the report says, was to instal so many charging stations that they become as common as gas stations.

However, weak demand for electric cars created a weak demand for charging stations, so the company and the DOE opted to spread the stations into five additional cities in order to reach the goal of 15,000 stations. The company also started pushing home chargers - both of which are factors that led the IG to conclude that the new plan undermined the goal of alleviating range anxiety in the initial markets.

'The real problem is the policy approach of the Obama administration,' said Paul Chesser, of the National Legal and Policy Center. 'The department of Energy and, really ECOtality, were in an impossible situation. President Obama says, ''There's going to be 1 million electric cars on the road by 2015, so here are billions to make it happen.'' And then nobody buys the cars.

Supply and demand: Government officials agree that there isn't enough demand for electric cars to warrant 15,000 charging stations

'It's a disastrous domino effect, a complication of a policy that was a bad idea,' Chesser said.

The plan calls for all charging stations to collect data from users. But many of the stations were so seldom used that the data they collected was useless in gauging public satisfaction.

'The lack of analysis by the Department or ECOtality prevented us from determining whether the reasoning behind these changes was sound and in the best interest of U.S. taxpayers,' the IG wrote.
