Joanna Inch (pictured), 22, was jailed for four months for stealing the pensioner's money

A carer has been caught on a home made CCTV camera taking £15 from the purse of the 93-year-old woman she was supposed to be looking after.

Joanna Inch was jailed for four months today for the heartless theft – and the judge said he wished he could have doubled the length of the sentence.

Mrs Nancy Rolf's son Alan became suspicious when she said money was going missing.

The judge said other carers may have taken cash from her – but it was 22-year-old Inch who was caught out when Mr Rolf fitted the covert CCTV camera in the kitchen of her home in Barnstaple, North Devon.

Inch denied the theft charge and told police that Mrs Rolf had given her the money which she had taken from her purse which was in her handbag in the kitchen – before she stashed the two notes into the back of her mobile phone.

Inch even whinged to the jury that the case had cost her her job as a carer, her car and her income.

But Judge Phillip Wassall said today at Exeter Crown Court that Mrs Rolf had given very clear evidence via video link from North Devon.

He said: 'She was telling the truth, her memory was extraordinary and completely clear.'

He said Inch, from Bideford, North Devon, had shown no remorse and was still in total denial that she had done anything wrong.

The judge said elderly people 'befriend and rely' on those who care for them in their own homes and the betrayal and breach of trust by Inch was evident.

He said: 'The £15 taken is a small amount of money but the breach of trust is so high that it passed the custody threshold.

The CCTV showed Inch going into the kitchen and opening the purse and taking out one note, which she places on the table, before pulling out a second note.

She then left the kitchen before returning with disabled Mrs Rolf, who walks with a zimmer frame.

Prosecutor Gareth Evans said Inch told police that Mrs Rolf had 'given her the money', but the frail pensioner denied that was the case when she gave her evidence during the trial last year.

Inch will spend two months in jail before she is released on licence - the judge said he had taken her age into account.

Nigel Wraith, defending, said she had no previous convictions and the theft conviction would blight the rest of her life having worked hard to earn a diploma in health and social care so that she could become a regular carer to Mrs Rolf.
