A British mother had taken domestic violence warrants out on her deranged ex-partner who could have been detained in police custody, preventing him from murdering their 11-year-old son at sports practice in Australia.

Rosemary Batty watched in horror as Greg Anderson stabbed and beat their son, Luke Batty, to death with a cricket bat on Wednesday after an evening training session in a Melbourne suburb.

Warrants for Anderson's arrest on domestic violence and child pornography charges were active at the time of the attack, the Herald Sun reported.

Ms Batty, who comes from Willingham, Cambridgeshire, had told police she believed Anderson had a mental disorder after he threatened to kill her last year.

Last month, a Melbourne magistrate issued the warrants for his arrest, but police failed to locate Anderson, who was living in his unregistered car.

When Anderson was shot on Wednesday evening by four police officers who were attempting to halt the frenzied attack on his son, it may have been a case of 'suicide by cop'.

While emergency services were too late to save the 11-year-old, who died at the scene, police attempted to subdue the father with capsicum spray.

Horrified parents and children who were gathered at the ground for evening cricket training at Tyabb Cricket Ground, in Victoria, watched on as the 54-year-old charged with a knife at one of the officers, who shot him in the chest.

Luke was a keen cricketer and had been playing with his father just moments before he was killed

Rosemary Batty said she believed the boy's father loved him, but had mental health issues.

Describing the moments leading up to her son's death she said 'Luke came to me' and he said, 'Could I have a few more minutes with my dad?' because he doesn't see him very often and I said, 'Sure, OK.'

'It was just a little cricket practice, there were people there, I believed he was safe,' said Mrs Batty, 52.

'I looked for help, and I ran towards help and screaming, 'Get an ambulance, get an ambulance, this is bad, this is really, really bad,' she said.

'From what I could see, Luke had been injured. I thought it was an accident, I had no reason to think otherwise.'

Police arrived on the scene and attempted to subdue the man with capsicum spray. When that did not work and the boy's father began threatening police with a knife they shot him

It is believed the man intended 'suicide-by-police'. After he was shot, the man was taken to hospital, but he died later that night

'What triggered this was a case of his dad having mental health issues,' she told the Herald Sun.

'He was in a homelessness situation for many years, his life was failing, everything was becoming worse in his life and Luke was the only bright light in his life.

'No one loved Luke more than his father. No one loved Luke more than me — we both loved him.'

Recounting the horrific incident, she added: 'It was just a normal cricket practice and most of the kids and their parents had gone.

'Luke came to me and said could I have a few more minutes with my dad because he doesn’t see him very often and I said yes, sure, that’s OK.

'There’s no reason for me to be concerned, there was no reason to be concerned, I thought it was in an open environment - that’s something I have to understand.'

Disbelief: Luke Batty was in Year Six at a local primary school and his death has rocked his school community

Horrific: The attack was witnessed by several people, including children, who had just finished cricket practice at the pitch

Ms Batty, who is originally from Lincoln in England said that police told her it was a calculated act that would have occurred at some point.

The news has shocked Australians, who have posted tributes to Luke Batty on social media, and praised Ms Batty for her the bravery after she faced the media on Thursday to pay tribute to the son she called her 'guiding star'.

The horrific attack unfolded at around 6.30pm in an outer suburb of Melbourne on the picturesque Mornington Peninsula in Victoria.

Tyabb is a quiet township with a country fire station, a railway station and three small primary schools including Flinders Christian Community College, where the boy was a sixth grade pupil.

Local police from Mornington station arrived on the scene at 6.40pm, when four officers confronted the man and tried unsuccessfully to subdue him with capsicum spray.

Witnesses told the Herald Sun the father turned on them with the knife, forcing one of the officers to shoot him in the chest.

Paramedics tried to save the boy, but he died at the scene from severe head injuries.

An emergency services helicopter took Greg Anderson to the Alfred hospital, where he died at around 1.30am on Thursday.

Victoria Police commander Doug Fryer confirmed officers shot the father as a last resort.

'They’ve attempted to use less than lethal force, ' Commander Fryer said. 'They’ve attempted to talk him down. That has been unsuccessful.

'They have then discharged a firearm, hitting that male once in the chest.

'We’ve had an absolute tragedy here tonight. It’s a horrific scene.'

Police later interviewed witnesses, including young children.

The incident has shocked the local community, with one resident describing  how 'a shiver' ran down his spine when he heard 'a couple of pops' and realised they were gunshots.

Tyabb Cricket Club’s junior cricket co-ordinator, Ron Dyall, said the boy had played for the club for two or three years and was also an avid footballer.

Mr Dyall said he was devastated by what had happened.

'My own son plays in [the boy's] team. I’m trying to figure out how to break it to him, and how we’re gonna deal with the kids.'

The Victorian Homicide Squad has launched an investigation into the deaths.
