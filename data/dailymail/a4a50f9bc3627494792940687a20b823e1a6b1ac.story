A mother has described the heartbreak of watching her son scratch himself until he bled due to severe eczema.

Jessica Chandler said her son Ollie, who is now nearly two, developed skin so dry and flaky it looked as though he has been in a fire.

She was mortified when strangers repeatedly asked if Ollie had been burned, and felt paranoid other parents believed she was neglecting her son.

After an embarrassing confrontation on a train, in which she was once again asked how her baby got burned, Miss Chandler became determined to find a treatment that would help.

His mother Jessica, 27, began searching for a cure for her son's condition online, as she became paranoid people might think her son's appearance made her look neglectful

Miss Chandler said her son would scratch his skin until it bled, which was heartbreaking for her to watch

While doctors struggled to find a cure, Miss Chandler stumbled on a cream she claimed almost cured her son’s eczema within weeks.

She is now calling for greater understanding of the condition to help other mothers whose children are affected.

The 27-year-old said: ‘I’m well aware it isn’t life threatening but when you have a little one who is constantly in pain, irritable and uncomfortable and medical professionals don’t seem to take that seriously, it is incredibly frustrating. 

‘My son’s eczema was so bad he would scratch himself until he bled which was heartbreaking.

‘As a mother, watching your little one suffer like that is awful - but nothing I was prescribed seemed to work. 

‘It got the stage that people were constantly asking me what had happened to Ollie and I even started to get paranoid that people might think I wasn’t looking after him properly when nothing could have been further from the truth.’ 

Miss Chandler, a furniture restorer from Wolverhampton, said her son had struggled with the condition since he was born.

She said: ‘Ollie developed a rash soon after birth that would come and go for weeks. But I was told it was nothing to worry about.’

But as the months passed she noticed dry patches on his face and elbow. 

Then in November last year the rash began to darken and spread leading Miss Chandler and her engineer fiancé David Bennett, 28, to think their son had chicken pox.

After a yet another stranger asked how Ollie had been burned, Miss Chandler became determined to find a treatment that would help her son

She stumbled across a cream containing beeswax online, created by a mother who had become frustrated with the medications her daughter had been prescribed. She claims she saw an improvement within weeks

Their GP diagnosed an infection and prescribed antibiotics but the rash got worse and doctors eventually concluded that the tot was suffering with severe eczema. 

Miss Chandler said: ‘By this stage he was crying all the time because he could not stop scratching and it was very upsetting to see him so distraught.’ 

But the creams prescribed did little to combat symptoms and Miss Chandler instead turned to keeping her son wrapped in clothing to prevent him from being able to scratch while she tried different lotions. 

Purepotions has a range called Skin Salvation suitable for eczema sufferers.

The products contain beeswax, which the manufacturer claims works as a natural antibacterial barrier, protecting the skin from external irritants.

They also contain hemp, which is rich in essential fatty acids which are lacking in those with dry skin.

Purepotions claims the products replenish dry skin with natural oils and have no known side effects.

The products contains no parabens, preservatives or perfumes, they say.

She says she grew self-conscious of people staring when they went out, especially after Ollie had managed to scratch himself during the night. 

Miss Chandler said: ‘It wasn’t unusual for Ollie to scratch himself until he bled.

'And on top of that, his skin was very dry and flaky and his hair always looked greasy due to all the creams and potions. 

‘I was terrified that people would think he was neglected because he looked like such a sorry little thing. 

‘I was up most nights online researching and doing everything I could to try and improve his condition.’ 

She struggled on with numerous creams, but became concerned she was rubbing chemicals into her son’s skin and seeing no improvement. 

The turning point came in December last year when she took Ollie on a day out to Birmingham on the train. 

As they took their seats a lady leaned over and with a concerned look asked Miss Chandler how her son’s face had been burned. 

She said: ‘When I tried to explain that Ollie had not been in a fire and the marks on his face were in fact eczema I felt like I was lying even thought it was the truth. 

‘It made me more determined than ever to find something that worked.’ 

While searching for a cure online she found an article by a mother who had invented her own cream after becoming similarly frustrated with the medications her daughter had been prescribed. 

Within a few months of applying the cream daily she said the it nearly cured Ollie's eczema

Miss Chandler said: ‘Ollie is so much happier and not scratching anywhere near as much as he did'. He is pictured as a baby

Natalie Balmond had designed Skin Salvation in her kitchen after struggling with her daughter’s condition. 

Her company Purepotions had sold thousands of bottles and the cream was made available on prescription. 

When Miss Chandler read Purepotion’s Skin Salvation was available on the NHS she urged her GP to allow her to try it.

After a few weeks of applying the cream daily, she claims she began to see an improvement, and has since seen  80 to 90 per cent of the eczema clear up.

She said: ‘I am over the moon to have finally found something that works. 

‘Ollie is so much happier and not scratching anywhere near as much as he did. 

‘Finally he can enjoy being a happy child again and we can go out without people asking what has happened to him.’
