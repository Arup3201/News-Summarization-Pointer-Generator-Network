Parents had their own teenage girls arrested earlier this month after returning home unannounced from a weekend break to find a raucous party underway at their house.

The couple, from Glastonbury, Connecticut, called the police when they found underage children drinking at their home.

Officers arrived at the home in Neipsic Road on October 13 to find around 20 to 30 youths with alcohol.

Police arrested a 15-year-old girl and 16-year-old girl who live at the home, according to the Hartford Courant.Â 

Their identities have not been revealed because of their ages. The two females were charged with permitting a minor to possess alcohol.

Glastonbury police continue to investigate and asked anyone with information to contact authorities.

The girls had thrown parties on the Friday and Saturday nights that their parents were out of town. They had tried to get a third event going when they were surprised.

Police said that many children ran from the house when officers arrived and that the parents did the 'right thing' by calling them to the scene.
