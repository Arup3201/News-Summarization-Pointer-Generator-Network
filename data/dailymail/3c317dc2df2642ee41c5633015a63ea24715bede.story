The crazed man who stabbed New Mexico choir director Adam Alvarez along with three others on Sunday believed he was '99 percent sure Alvarez was a mason' involved in a conspiracy against him.

Lawrence Capener, 24, told investigators that he also stabbed the members of the public who tried to subdue him during his frenzied attack at St. Jude Thaddeus church because he feared they might be Masons too.

He has been charged with three counts of aggravated battery and is currently being held on $250,000 bail in Albuquerque - and his arrest affadavit says he has apologized for the stabbings.

St. Jude Thaddeus' pastor, the Rev. John Daniel, said Capener's mother was 'very active' in the parish and serves as a Eucharistic minister there.

'He was here occasionally but not very often,' Daniel said.

Daniel said that Capener had just graduated from a community college and appeared to be doing well after getting a job. 'I think he's been struggling for a while, maybe with some (mental) health issues,' Daniel said.

The attacks began when Lawrence Capener was shaking hands with his fellow churchgoers at Sunday Mass - exchanging the traditional peace offerings when people next to him noticed something strange - his hands were quite sweaty and clammy.

Then, as the choir began singing a hymn to wrap up Mass, the man bolted from his pew, ran to the choir area and started stabbing Alvarez and others, witnesses said.

The random and violent attack by the knife-wielding Capener, 24, sparked confusion and fear in the Albuquerque Westside church as the choir started singing 'Take My Hand, Precious Lord.'

According to a criminal complaint released Monday, Capener vaulted over pews and lashed out at choir director Adam Alvarez, who had his back toward him.

The complaint said church flutist Gerald Madrid saw Alvarez being attacked and attempted to 'bear hug' Capener to try and stop him. Madrid was then stabbed five times in his back by Capener, authorities said.

'I instinctively just dropped my flute and I rushed the guy,' Madrid said. 'I never saw a knife, but I just rushed him.'

At least two others were injured in the attack, police said.

Capener later told police that he was '99 percent sure Alvarez was a mason' and that he thought Alvarez was involved in a conspiracy.

He told the investigator that Masons are a group involved 'in a conspiracy that is far more reaching than I could or would believe.'

Among those to subdue Capener was off-duty Albuquerque Fire Department Lt. Greg Aragon, who then helped treat patients after the attack, authorities said. He was also stabbed in the attack and was later treated at a hospital and released.

The affidavit said Capener apologized for stabbing the others after he was read his rights and agreed to speak to police.

Masons are a fraternal group involved in charity and other community activities, but many of their rituals and symbols are secret.

Unprovoked: The attack occured just as the Sunday service was coming to an end when the man lept from the pews

Both Alvarez and Madrid remained hospitalized Monday and their families said the men were recovering from wounds that were described as not life-threatening.

Services at the 3,000-member church resumed Monday. Parishioners stopped to leave flowers, notes and candles outside the church and at the church's shrine dedicated to St. Jude, the church's namesake and the Catholic Patron Saint of 'lost causes.'

In Mass homilies throughout the day, Daniel said he compared St. Catherine of Siena, who worked for peace in 14th century Italy, with the power of forgiveness.

Robynn Madrid, whose husband Gerald Madrid was recovering from the attack, said despite the pain Capener caused, she's already forgiven him. 'We're praying for his family,' she said.

Spanish choir member Richard Aragon said he, too, is trying to show compassion and forgiveness, even though he had trouble sleeping the night after the stabbing. Aragon was preparing for the upcoming Spanish services when the attack began.

'There's nothing you can do. There's obviously something...he's touched or something,' Aragon said. 'It already happened. It's too late.'

Two parishioners told the Los Angeles Times that a man in his teens or early 20s leaped from the pews and stabbed the choir's lead singer at after communion at St. Jude Thaddeus Catholic Church.

'While that was going on, people were just panicking. It was scary, you wouldn’t think something like that would happen in church,' said Reyes Stinson, 18.

Another member of the congregation, Vanessa Lucero, 14, said she was sitting right behind the man, who 'was kind of twitchy, sketchy looking. He had a tattoo of an upside-down star on his wrist.'

She said the man climbed over the pews, punched and then repeatedly stabbed the choir's lead singer.

Ms Lucero who was witness to the entire incident said that as the man was being handcuffed old ladies who were present were telling him to forgive himself.

Archbishop of Santa Fe Michael Sheehan released a statement saying he was saddened by the attack. 'I pray for all who have been harmed, their families, the parishioners and that nothing like this will ever happen again,' Sheehan said.

In a statement, Albuquerque police have confirmed the man is now in custody but have not yet released him name.

They also have been unable to determine a motive for the attacks.
