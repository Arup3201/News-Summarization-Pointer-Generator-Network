A happy couple have made history on their wedding day by becoming the first people to get married on Southend Pier.

Ian Barnes and Emma Hunter tied the knot on Saturday afternoon on the iconic structure in Southend, Essex.

The pair decided on the unusual venue when they discovered The Cultural Centre, that opened last summer on the mile-long pier, had obtained a licence to hold marriage ceremonies.

Care assistant Emma, 24, said it was the perfect place for them to exchange their vows.

'We had our first date and kiss on the pier when it was an absolutely lovely day in the summer. It was very, very romantic,' she said.

Of her wedding say, she said: 'It's been such a lovely day and it has all come together so well. I can't wait to tell the grandkids that we were the first to get married at the pier.'

Her husband, paratrooper Ian, 22, added: 'When we were looking for places to get married, someone said that we could get married at the pier. I never dreamed we would get it but we did and it's been a brilliant day.'

The newlyweds have been together for more
than a year and are now looking forward to moving into their new home 
in Southend and going on their honeymoon.

The Cultural Centre, a mile off-shore, opened its doors last July, and can accommodate 200 people in its main hall.

Pier bosses said that they had received plenty of requests to host marriages on the pier down the years, but never had a venue until now.

Lynn Jones, resort services manager at Southend Council, said: 'The pier is attractive because it's a unique venue with wonderful views. Someone said to me that it would be the longest aisle in the world.

'We've had people asking whether they could get married at the pier for years, and now they finally can.'

Longest aisle in the world? The pier opened in 1889 is 1.34 miles long

Southend Pier was built in 1830 with the present iron structure first opened in 1889. An extension was then built to accommodate the increased number of visiting steamboats and when this opened in 1898, it became known as the New Pier Head.

A 'Pier Railway' was opened in 1890 providing a electric tram to take people along the promenade.

Another extension to bring the length to 1.34 miles was opened in 1929. Over the centuries, the pier has survived damage from collisions with boats, adverse weather and numerous fires to remain a popular tourist destination - and now a place to tie the knot.
