A beautician has launched a children's birthday party business offering full make-overs to girls as young as seven.

Mother-of-two Kelly Matthews, 27, from Gloucester, has set up Little Beauties, a party pamper service where primary school children learn how to apply a full-face of make-up, as well as having manicures and pedicures.

Kelly has been inundated with requests for parties from family and friends' children since running her first event last month.

She said: 'I think some girls would relish a break from the traditional bouncy castle party, or a party at a fast food restaurant that every child has.

'When I was young, I always used to sneak into my mum's room and try on her make-up, because I looked up to her and wanted to be pretty like her.

'I know when I was a little girl, I would have been thrilled if my mum had booked me a pamper party.

'I can't wait until my eight-month-old daughter is old enough to have a pamper party herself.

'No one ever taught me how to put make-up on, and I think that's something which many girls never get told how to do today.

'That's why when you go into town, you often see so many teenagers with their faces plastered in foundation or fake tan, but all they need is a bit of guidance as how to use the products they will use regardless, in moderation and properly.'

Kelly, who has two children Elsie-May, eight months, and Fletcher Wayne, two, and is an area administrator for a pharmaceutical company, hopes to make her business into a well-known brand and full-time career.

Providing pamper parties for girls aged seven and above, treatments on offer include manicures, pedicures, face pack treatments, hair curling and make-up lessons.

Kelly said: 'The feedback I've been getting from the girls and parents is that the parties are fun, surprisingly educational and something different, which is what I set out to achieve.'

The issue of putting make up on children can prove a sticky issue among parents.

Little children will always love raiding the dressing up box and playing around with mum's make-up, but there is growing concern over the 'hyper-sexualisation' of young girls.

There is a growing trend in Britain for not only children's pamper parties but also American-style beauty pageants - which sometimes accept newborn contestants.

The French government last month moved to 
protect young girls from potential dangers by banning such pageants and even threatening organisers with years in prison and fines.

While Kelly says that she's aware of these disturbing competitions, she insists her parties are all just about having fun.

She will provide two main types of parties, those for children aged around 7 - 11 and parties for teenagers from the ages of 12 and above.

At the younger children's parties, girls will be able to try on sparkly make-up and colourful nail varnishes.

For the parties aimed at teenagers, the emphasis will be on looking beautiful without using too much make-up.

She says: 'I plan to teach children how to look after their skin and apply cosmetic products correctly.'

Kelly prides herself on using high-quality, hypoallergenic products and says parental permission for all children receiving treatments will be sought.

She said: 'Children love dressing up and looking pretty, and what I plan to offer is something different and alternative to simply going to a party and getting their face painted.'

The creative beautician has always enjoyed party organising and said her pamper parties will involve more than just the girls getting a treatment.

After running a few test parties, Kelly aims to cater for parties of around six girls, but says she has trusted individuals who she will call on if she has bookings for larger parties.

Kelly said: 'I'm really excited about my new venture, and a career in health and beauty is something I've always wanted to do.'

Back in 2011 the Mail reported on specialist businesses across the country that offered 'pamper parties' 
and cosmetic tips to children.

The man advising David Cameron on the sexualisation of children promised to investigate its worrying findings.

'I am disturbed by this trend and I suspect I'm far from being alone,' said Reg Bailey, chief executive of the Christian parenting charity the Mothers' Union.
