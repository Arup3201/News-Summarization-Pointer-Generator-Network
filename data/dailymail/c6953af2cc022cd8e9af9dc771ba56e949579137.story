He was the mastermind of the mass prison break from a German camp which inspired the iconic film The Great Escape.

But a new book has now suggested Spitfire pilot Roger Bushell could also have been linked to the assassination of notorious Nazi officer Reinhard Heydrich, known as 'Hitler's Hangman' and the acting Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia.

Simon Pearson's The Great Escaper places Bushell in Prague at the time Heydrich's car was bombed by Czechoslovakian Jan Kubiš, and Slovak Jozef Gabčík, which led to the Nazi officer's death a number of days later.

Mr Pearson writes that although it is not known for certain whether Bushell was involved in the assassination, he had been among Prague's resistance fighters at the time and was even taken in for questioning by the Gestapo, The Times has reported.

Bushell, who was also known as 'Big X', had been hiding in Prague for a number of months.

During his time in the city he was offered shelter by Blažena Zeithammelová, who worked for the resistance.

Her family had also previously attempted to kill the head of the SS, Heinrich Himmler, while members of the Three Kings underground network.

Mr Pearson, whose book is being serialised in The Times, writes Zeithammelová and her family were executed following Heydrich's death, in a huge purge of Prague ordered by Hitler.

Bushell however was sent to Stalag Luft III following his interrogation by the Gestapo, which became 'an operational outpost of British intelligence' thanks to his system of coded letters.

Bushell was also head of the escape committee at the prisoner of war camp, which saw him come up with a plan to help 200 prisoners out of the camp.

He managed to lead 75 men out of one of three tunnels on March 24, 1944 before guards discovered the escape attempt.

He was 33 when he was shot by the Gestapo on Hitler's personal orders after being recaptured near the French border.

In 2011 the Daily Mail reported how light had been cast on Bushell's life after letters, diaries and photographs which survived the war had been handed over to the Imperial War Museum.

Squadron Leader Bushell, who lived in South Africa up until he was 14, was a Cambridge graduate, barrister and international skiier.

The mass breakout from the prison camp was highlighted in Paul Brickhill's book The Great Escape and also in the film that featured Richard Attenborough. But in the film the character was renamed Roger Barlett and bore little resemblance to the actual man.
