When Jose Mourinho wants something, Chelsea’s manager comes into his own. The capture of Cesc Fabregas from Barcelona was no exception.

The moment he was tipped off that the Catalans’ sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta had told Fabregas he could leave the Nou Camp, Mourinho went to work at breathtaking speed.

He flew to Spain to meet Fabregas days after Barcelona’s final La Liga game of the season against Atletico Madrid on May 17. The Spain midfielder was blown away by the gesture.

Mourinho made Fabregas feel special again, a wanted man after three largely frustrating years in the shadow of his great friend Lionel Messi.

These grand gestures are Mourinho’s speciality. Getting the personal treatment from a coach who has won titles in Portugal, England, Italy and Spain — and twice lifted the Champions League — usually does the trick.

Famously, Mourinho met Ashley Cole in London’s Royal Garden Hotel in January 2005 (without Arsenal’s permission) and also gave Steve Sidwell a tour of his Georgian townhouse in Eaton Square when the player left Reading in 2007. It works every time.

This summer, Chelsea’s manager, who had decided to return to the family home in Portugal instead of travelling to the World Cup, wanted his transfer business done early.

Blowing the league title, when Chelsea were in with a chance of winning it until his proud unbeaten home record was taken by Sunderland, had irritated him.

Mourinho’s pitch to Fabregas, the promise of a position of his own in Chelsea’s midfield and the prospect of being the link man for Diego Costa, convinced him to return to London.

By then he knew that Frank Lampard would leave Stamford Bridge after 13 years and Fabregas could be the main man for Chelsea for the next five years.

Lampard was earning £150,000 a week in his final year at Chelsea and his departure had left a big hole in the budget. Chelsea could easily afford Fabregas’ salary demands.

Mourinho was familiar with Arsenal’s buy-back clause, the agreement reached with Barcelona in 2011 when he returned home in a deal worth £35million. Knowing that Arsenal traditionally move slowly on transfers, Mourinho believed he had time. The biggest threat was Manchester City.

Fabregas had scored against City in the Champions League last season, opening the scoring at the Nou Camp when Barcelona ran out 2-1 winners in the second leg of the knockout stage.

City declared their interest but believed Fabregas would wait until after the World Cup in Brazil before deciding about his future. Manchester United were keen too, but also waited while Louis van Gaal was leading Holland to the semi-finals in Brazil. Mourinho took full advantage.

As early as January this year, when rumours began to circulate that Fabregas would be leaving Barca, Chelsea’s technical department started to log his performances. Mourinho, using a specially designed app on his iPad, was monitoring his targets as the season came to a close. Chelsea’s manager loves that device.

Chelsea's only concern was the delicate issue of Fabregas's relationship with his girlfriend, Daniella Semaan

Scott McLachlan, Chelsea’s head of international scouts, had delegated different members of staff to travel to every Atletico Madrid fixture.

Ostensibly they were present to monitor the form of Thibaut Courtois, but it also gave cover for their pursuit of Costa. Suddenly, Fabregas was also on the list of players routinely monitored by Chelsea.

A dossier was built up, a picture of his playing career and personal life as they weighed up the possibility of spending £40m, along with a five-year contract worth £160,000 plus bonuses.

On the field he ticked every box. Off the field there was the delicate issue of his relationship with his girlfriend, Daniella Semaan. Her ex-husband, Elie Taktouk, is based in London and he dragged Fabregas’ name into a complicated divorce settlement in the capital’s Court of Appeal last year. It has been far from amicable.

That messy divorce was Chelsea’s only concern, but from the moment Fabregas became available, Mourinho decided he was his man.

After Fabregas met Zubizarreta a few days after Barca were beaten to La Liga by Atletico Madrid, he was free to leave.

As if Sunday’s Fabregas reunion isn’t intriguing enough, John Terry and Alexis Sanchez also have previous. Terry was sent off for kneeing the Barcelona forward, now at Arsenal, which ruled him out of Chelsea’s Champions League win in 2012.

Mourinho met Fabregas in Spain, talking to the midfielder for hours about his future and his role in the Chelsea team. Fabregas had become frustrated at the Nou Camp and was never really considered a true Barcelona player by the hardcore supporters.

They saw him as a homegrown talent who left the legendary La Masia academy in 2003 for buttons and it had cost the Catalans £35m to bring him home. To them, it didn’t make sense.

For his part, Mourinho told the player that his work at Arsenal was done and that Chelsea would dominate domestic football in this country. Wenger, remember, has never beaten one of Mourinho’s teams.

That day, Fabregas agreed to join Chelsea and accept the consequences from the Arsenal fans who once idolised him. On June 12, 2014, the day before Spain’s opening game against Holland at the World Cup, Chelsea announced his arrival on a five-year deal.

Wenger has always insisted that he decided not to activate the clause in Fabregas’ contract that gave Arsenal first refusal when he decided to return to London.

Yesterday, though, when Arsenal’s manager was asked ‘ultimately, whose decision was it (not to return)?’ he answered emphatically: ‘Cesc Fabregas’.’

The reality is that Mourinho had outmanouevred him.
