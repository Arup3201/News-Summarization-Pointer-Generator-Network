A new app called Peppr was launched in Germany this month to connect potential clients with nearby prostitutes using their phone's GPS capabilities.

It is described asÂ  a cross between the car-ordering service app Uber and the dating app Tinder.

Clients log into the app and type in what they want: body type, eye color, personality traits, and the maximum price they are willing to pay.

Traditionally sex workers relied on cards in phone boxes - but now they have an app that can connect them with clients

Clients log into the app and type in what they want: body type, eye color, personality traits, and the maximum price they are willing to pay.

It then uses GPS to match them with nearby sex workers, who must be independent sex workers and pass an interview.

Pia Poppenreiter, the creator of the app, says she wanted to create a tool that prevented sex workers from waiting in the cold to find clients.

Poppenreiter says she pre-interviews people who wish to use the app to make sure they are working voluntarily and independently in the business.

'We have a short conversation to get the feeling that this is voluntary and they are independent sex workers,' she said.

'We try to ask them - you kind of find out in a conversation whether they're doing it on a voluntary basis - we ask them what they did before, whether they've always worked voluntarily and so on.'

Pia says she came up with the idea after seeing sex workers out on the streets.

'The story always sounds corny, but it's true,' she told German start-up magazine Grunderszene.

'Like tinder for prostitutes' - Peppr app launches in Germany to connect prostitutes with clients

'On a late autumn day in Berlin, I was on my way with a friend to a bar on Oranienburger Strasse.

'It was cold - I had a skirt on myself - and I saw a sex worker on the street.

'I thought, 'It's crazy that there's an app for everything, but not for that.

'Why do they have to stand there in the winter all day?' That thought never left me,'
