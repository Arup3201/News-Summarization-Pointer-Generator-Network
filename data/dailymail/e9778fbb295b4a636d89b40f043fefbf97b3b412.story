Running apps record distance, speed and calories, but one jogger has taken this mapping technology a step further.

San Francisco-based Claire Wyckoff has turned her Nike+ app and tracker into a makeshift virtual pen - and uses it to draw outlines on a virtual map.

Her first creation was a corgi, but she has since turned her hand - or more accurately her legs - to a space invader, Slimer from Ghosbusters, and four penises.

Claire Wyckoff uses the tracking app to produce drawings as she runs around San Francisco. She ‘drew’ her first image in June. Her most recent drawing was made on 5 August and shows an alien space invader, (pictured left) inspired by the 1978 Atari game (screen shot pictured right)

The Nike+ Running app tracks distance, pace, time and calories burned using GPS.

It also gives you audio feedback as the user runs. 

All runs and tracked data is automatically uploaded to nikeplus.com onto virtual maps. 

This shows the route, elevation, time and calories. 

Ms Wyckoff told the MailOnline she doesn't edit any of the images before uploading them to her blog, however, the different colours depend on when she takes the screengrab.

The solid red lines are taken from screengrabs, mid run.

The green images are taken after the run has been finished and saved.  

Each drawing traces routes around San Francisco, including Golden Gate Park, Hippie Hill and Monument Avenue.

The different colours represent different speeds, and in drawings which involve more than one line, Wyckoff stopped the app tracking her, before enabling it again.

Her start and end points are also shown.

Meanwhile, other images are shown in solid red.

The first image was posted to Ms Wyckoff’s Running Drawing Tumblr blog in June, and featured a corgi.

This image is one of four penises Ms Wyckoff has 'drawn' during runs around San Francisco. This penis was plotted as she ran around Maymont Park and towards Monument Avenue

This was followed by three penises - at Golden Gate Park, Maymont, and Agrecroft Hall - and an image of a pilgrim’s head at Maymont again. 

On 2 July, Ms Wyckoff ran 4.2 miles (6.7km) around Golden Gate Park to draw Slimer from Ghostbusters.

Almost a week later she plotted a hand with its middle finger sticking up, drawn as she ran around the Inner Sunset of San Francisco.
