Californian prisons will be allowed to force-feed hunger striking inmates, a federal judge ordered today.

U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson approved a request from state and federal officials concerned about the welfare of nearly 70 
hunger-striking inmates who have refused all prison-issued meals for seven weeks.

Standard prison policy is to let inmates starve to death if they have signed legally binding do-not-resuscitate (DNR) requests.

Prison officials already can seek a court order forcing an individual inmate to take food, though they have not done so.

But now, state corrections officials and a
federal receiver who controls inmate medical care have received blanket 
authority to
feed inmates who may be in failing health.

The order includes those who recently signed requests that they not be revived.

The Prison Law Office, a Berkeley-based 
nonprofit that represents inmates' welfare in ongoing lawsuits that led 
to a federal takeover of the prison health care system and a requirement
that the state sharply reduce its inmate population to improve 
conditions, also joined in the request.

The filing came as prison officials and inmates' attorneys argued over whether strikers should be allowed to voluntarily begin a liquid diet.Â 

'Patients have a right to refuse medical treatment. They also have a right to refuse food,' said Joyce Hayhoe, a spokeswoman for the receiver's office.

'If an inmate gets to the point where he can't tell us what his wishes are, for instance if he's found unresponsive in his cell, and we don't have a DNR, we're going to get nourishment into him. That's what doctors do. They're going to follow their medical ethics.

'We'd take any and all measures to sustain their life.'

The process, which prison officials call 'refeeding', could include starting intravenous fluids or snaking feeding tubes through inmates' noses and into their stomachs.

Under the new system, DNR orders signed by a hunger striker at or near the beginning of the strike or during the hunger strike would automatically be deemed invalid.

However Jules Lobel, president of the Center for
Constitutional Rights, who represents 10 inmates suing to end prolonged
solitary confinement at Pelican Bay State Prison, said the decision violates international law.

'Force-feeding violates international law to the extent that it involves somebody who doesn't give their consent,' he said

Lobel said prison officials should look for alternatives, including providing the inmates with a liquid diet of fruit and vegetable drinks as they have requested, or negotiating with inmates over their demands.

Lobel said he will not seek to overturn Henderson's order.

Prison officials said inmates are free to consume a liquid diet, but will be counted as having ended their hunger strike if they consume anything more than water, vitamins and electrolytes.

The most high-profile case of force-feeding prisoners has been the involuntary feeding of several dozen terrorism suspects held at Guantanamo Bay through nasal tubes.

Other federal judges have turned down bids by the Guantanamo Bay inmates to stop the force-feeding. U.S. District Judge Rosemary M. Collyer said in a ruling last month that numerous courts said it is the government's duty to prevent suicide and to provide life-saving nutritional and medical care to people in custody.

California incarcerates about 3,600 inmates in what are known as Security Housing Units, some because of crimes they committed in prison and others for indefinite terms if they are validated as leaders of prison gangs.

Four prisons have the units: Pelican Bay in Crescent City, Corcoran, California Correctional Institution in Tehachapi and California State Prison-Sacramento.

The highest-ranking gang leaders are held in what is known as the 'short corridor' at Pelican Bay.

Four leaders of rival white supremacist, black and enemy Latino gangs have formed an alliance to promote the hunger strike in a bid to force an end to the isolation units.
