It broke to Aaron Ramsey, 30 yards out and all alone; the Welshman sauntered up before unleashing the sort of effort stunning for its sereneness rather than overriding power. 

Tuesday night's finish - away at Galatasaray in a game Arsenal cruised through - ranks as one of the best in Champions League history. 

But where does it stand against the net-bulgers and fluent team moves witnessed since the competition's inception? Sportsmail takes a look.

20. Alan Smith (Leeds vs Lazio - 2000) 

Just look at that Mark Viduka flick. The big Aussie held off his marker on the edge of the box, waiting for the onrushing Smith - who'd started the move in midfield - and the striker poked home in the Stadio Olympico. 

Alan Smith was as cool as you like as he swept Leeds into a lead away at Lazio back in 2000 

19. Stelios (Olympiacos vs Porto - 1997)

The opening game of the 1997 Champions League, and Olympiacos set about gaining points. Porto attacked, the hosts broke and there was Stelios - he of Bolton fame latterly - to scream in an effort from 30 yards. 

18. Shunsuke Nakamura (Celtic vs Manchester United - 2006)

This was beauty personified. The Japanese stood over the ball at a hushed Celtic Park with the scores goalless before sending that pocket of Glasgow wild as they beat Sir Alex Ferguson's United. 

Shunsuke Nakamura bent a wicked free-kick over the Manchester United wall at Celtic Park in 2006

17. Dejan Savicevic (AC Milan vs Barcelona - 1994) 

Two to the good in the Champions League final, Savicevic put the game beyond Barcelona with a wonderfully weighted lob before Marcel Desailly wrapped up a 4-0 win.

16. Oscar (Chelsea vs Juventus - 2012) 

Back to goal, Oscar only needed one touch to take himself beyond Andrea Pirlo and Leonardo Bonucci before bending a wicked effort into Gianluigi Buffon's top corner. 

Oscar had clipped the ball beyond Andrea Pirlo before this effort soared into the Juventus net in 2012

15. Lars Ricken (Dortmund vs Juventus - 1997)

The break was one in the '97 final, but Ricken didn't have an awful lot of options. Thirty-five yards out, he opted to audaciously chip Angelo Peruzzi in the Juventus goal and clinch victory for the Germans (and Paul Lambert).

Lars Ricken scored this 35-yard lob as Dortmund went on to clinch the 1997 Champions League title 

14. Thierry Henry (Arsenal vs Sparta Prague - 2005) 

Nudge the ball out of his feet running the wrong way, stopping in his tracks and curling a shot with the outside of his foot across the goalkeeper. Classic Henry. 

Thierry Henry was in an improvising mood as he swept an effort home for Arsenal at Sparta Prague 

13. Paul Scholes (Manchester United vs Panathinaikos - 2000)

What a team goal this was. Pass, pass, pass. Thirty later and Scholes caps a glorious move with a deft lob. What United fans would now give... 

Paul Scholes finished off the Manchester United move with this deft lob against the Greeks 

12. Zlatan Ibrahimovic (PSG vs Anderlecht - 2013) 

You could quite easily compile one of these lists for Ibrahimovic himself, but this has to be his best European strike. A few strides before viciously lashing home from way out.

11. Marc Overmars (Barcelona vs Liverpool - 2001) 

There haven't been many better teams goals scored in the Champions League and this was all the more impressive given Barcelona were away at Anfield.

10. Claudio Lopez (Valencia vs PSV - 1999)  

Technique, poise and power: the best goal Lopez ever scored. A long direct ball from halfway dropped over the Argentine's shoulder and he volleyed left-footed across the goalkeeper into the top corner. 

9. Aaron Ramsey (Arsenal vs Galatasaray - 2014)  

So this is where Ramsey's effort makes Sportsmail's top 20 - a goal Arsenal fans will be talking about for some time.

8. Lionel Messi (Barcelona vs Real Madrid - 2011) 

Messi's individual brillince is unquestioned, but the magnitude of this Clasico makes his slaloming run through the Real Madrid defence all the more elegant.

Lionel Messi completed his weaving run at Real Madrid by sliding beyond Sergio Ramos in 2011 

7. George Weah (PSG vs Bayern Munich - 1994)  

Never a man to appear rushed, Weah beat a number of the German defence at his own pace before firing beyond keeper Oliver Khan at his near post.

6. Dejan Stankovic (Inter Milan vs Schalke - 2011)

An example of Manuel Neuer getting his rush goalkeeping role wrong but Stankovic still had to control a volley from the halfway line to get the ball above the stopper and into the San Siro net.

5. Cristiano Ronaldo (Manchester United vs Porto - 2009) 

Forty yards from goal away from home, three yards of space and only one outcome. An absolutely unstoppable strike.  

Cristiano Ronaldo scored from way out when Manchester United played at Porto five years ago

4. Zinedine Zidane (Real Madrid vs Bayer Leverkusen - 2002)

Another goal from a final and this was superb. From a standing start, Zidane took Roberto Carlos' looped cross on with his wrong foot and volleyed in at Hampden Park.  

Zinedine Zidane's volley in the 2002 final at Hampden Park is one of the greatest ever scored 

3. Juninho (Lyon vs Bayern Munich - 2004)

Potentially the greatest free-kick taker of all time, Juninho beat Khan from 35 yards with a shot which was forever above the line of the crossbar and had the goalkeeper sprawling so far to his left that he bashed his head on the post. 

Lyon's players celebrate with Brazilian Juninho after his thumping free-kick away at Bayern Munich 

2. Ronaldinho (Barcelona vs Chelsea - 2005) 

Just marvel at the footwork. On the edge of the box at Stamford Bridge, desperately needing a goal at 3-1 down, the Brazilian shimmied his right foot this way and that before clipping a ball around Petr Cech. 

Ronaldinho had Ricardo Carvalho completed bamboozled by his footwork at Stamford Bridge in 2005 

1. Mauro Bressan (Fiorentina vs Barcelona - 1999) 

The ultimate display of control. There a ball broke just inside the Barcelona final third during a scrappy piece of play and the midfielder - who only found the net twice for Fiorentina - performed a stunning bicycle kick to tee up a six-goal thriller. Rivaldo and Luis Figo scored for the visitors as the teams drew 3-3 in the group stage.
