Shot dead: 18-year-old Dane Scott Jr. was shot a few weeks after the death of Trayvon Martin, the black teen who was unarmed when he was shot in Florida by a neighborhood watch volunteer

An Oklahoma jury Tuesday convicted a veteran police captain of first-degree manslaughter in the death of an unarmed teenager who was running away after scuffling with the officer.

Del City Police Capt. Randy Trent Harrison shot Dane Scott Jr. in the back on March 14, 2012, following a high-speed chase that began when Harrison tried to pull over Scott's car.

Harrison had previously arrested Scott on drug violations, and prosecutors said his pursuit of the teenager crossed the line from professional to personal.

The defense portrayed Scott as a drug dealer and said Harrison believed the teen was reaching for a second weapon after the officer took one gun from him during a scuffle that followed the police chase.

The jury announced the verdict and recommended the minimum four-year prison sentence after deliberating for about 11 hours over two days.

Harrison showed no emotion when the verdict was read. He was handcuffed by sheriff's deputies and led to the Oklahoma County jail.

Scott's family wept and hugged one another after the verdict was read. The family said nothing to reporters outside the courtroom.

Convicted: Del City police Capt. Randy Harrison has been found guilty of first-degree manslaughter

The shooting occurred just a few weeks
after the death of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed black teenager killed by
a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida, and the defense suggested 
early on that prosecutors were influenced to file charges to prevent the
type of racial discord that followed that shooting and another 
high-profile case in Tulsa last year. Harrison is white; Scott was 
black.

Prosecutors 
haven't said Harrison was motivated by any racial bias, just that 
Harrison was wrong to shoot Scott. The jury included three 
African-Americans.

Oklahoma
County District Attorney David Prater became emotional after the 
verdict was announced as he talked to reporters. 'There are no winners 
here,' he said.

'We will police our own,' Prater said. 'This is a tough case. It had to be done.'

Scene of the scuffle: A police affidavit says Harrison was trying to arrest Scott after a car chase and took a handgun from the teen. As Scott ran away, Harrison fired four times, with the fourth shot striking Scott in the back

John Lockett, 17 (left) the friend of Dane Scott Jr. (right) who was fatally shot by an Oklahoma police captain testified Tuesday that the unarmed 18-year-old was running away when the officer began firing at him

Defense attorney Doug Friesen said he will ask the judge to allow Harrison to remain free while his conviction is appealed. 'I am sorry for Randy, for the way this came out,' Friesen said. 'I wish I could have done a better job.'

During the trial, Scott's baggy pants became a central issue. Witnesses say the 18-year-old was trying to hold them up as he ran from Harrison. Although the witnesses testified that they saw no threat from Scott, Harrison and his defense team said the officer believed he was reaching for his pants pocket, where he could have had another gun. Police did not find a weapon on Scott after the shooting.

Prater told jurors during closing arguments Monday that Harrison put other people in danger when he fired four shots at Scott, placing bystanders and a fellow officer in harm's way before hitting the teenager in the back with the fourth shot.

Prater said Scott was 'no threat at all' at the time. 'He's running and holding his pants,' the prosecutor added.

Harrison, a 23-year veteran officer in the Oklahoma City suburb, testified earlier Monday that he feared for his life.

'He had just tried to kill me. He would kill anybody to escape,' Harrison testified. Harrison said he did not want to kill Scott. 'I just didn't have any other choice,' he said.

Friesen told jurors that while prosecutors had tried to portray Harrison as 'an out-of-control maniac,' he was actually trying to protect his life and the lives of others.

A police affidavit says Scott was unarmed and posed no threat of death or great bodily harm. Harrison faces a minimum of four years and a maximum of life in prison if convicted of manslaughter

Another police officer was running about 10 to 15 feet behind Scott and had just shot him with a Taser when Harrison fired the fatal shot, according to an affidavit.

The officer who used the Taser said he didn't see the teen with another weapon. Another witness said it appeared Scott was raising his hands, as if to surrender, when he was shot.

According to police, Scott had previous convictions in juvenile court on misdemeanor drug charges and a pending felony case of drug possession with intent to distribute.

Harrison had arrested Scott as he allegedly sold drugs near Del City High School in 2011. Court papers indicate Harrison also saw Scott allegedly selling marijuana from his home. Scott allegedly was selling drugs to a passenger in his car before the pursuit that led to the shooting.

The charges against Harrison were filed just after two white men were accused of fatally shooting three black people in Tulsa in what prosecutors said were racially motivated attacks.
