More than a third of pupils at independent schools are now getting financial support to continue their studies

Bursaries at independent schools have soared in value by a fifth in three years as hard-up British parents struggle to pay soaring fees.

More than a third of pupils at independent schools are now getting financial support to continue their studies.

Means-tested awards have gone up by around £50 million since 2010 from £255million in 2010 to £303 million, including an increase of 6.7 per cent since last year.

Education experts said the figures, from the Independent Schools Council, showed private schools were having to help even wealthy British parents to afford private education for their children.

Instead they are becoming increasingly reliant on wealthy overseas students paying full fees.

The numbers of foreign youngsters attending fee-paying schools rose by 1.4 per cent between 2012 and 2013 - around 365 extra children - as the number of British students or those resident in the UK, fell by around 0.4 per cent, down around 1,893 children.

Chris McGovern, a former independent school headteacher and chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said even lawyers and bankers were complaining of being unable to meet fees that average £27,612 for boarders and £12,153 for day pupils.

‘The increase in fees has been dramatic in the past 20 years and there is pressure on public schools, particularly those that are away from centres of affluence,’ he said.

‘The system is healthy but it is becoming reliant on the influx of money and pupils from overseas.’

Britain’s 1,223 private schools - which have 508,000 pupils - now hand out £303 million each year in means-tested bursaries, defined by the Good Schools Guide as ‘for helping out the impoverished but deserving and those fallen on hard times’.

Over two-fifths of parents who receive financial support have more than half the cost waived. Around one in 100 children are educated for free.

A further £174 million is used to reduce fees for eligible pupils, including children of armed forces personnel and clergy. Another £145 million goes on scholarships.

The hand-outs means 33.7 per cent of pupils now receive some form of financial support.In 2007, 31.5 per cent of pupils had help with their fees.

 Despite the awards, the number of pupils slid 0.3 per cent from last year among the 1,204 schools that took part in both censuses.

Fees rose 3.9 per cent last year, according to the ISC annual census - the lowest increase for 20 years but still well above the rate of inflation.

Pupil numbers also flatlined over the past 12 months, despite increasing numbers of foreign pupils sent by parents keen for their children to experience a British education.

Pupil numbers have now fallen or stagnated in all but one of the last five years.

The biggest decline between 2012 and 2013 was among boarders, with a 1.4 per cent drop.

Some of the shortfall was made up by a 1.4 per cent increase in non-British pupils, pushing the total to nearly 26,000. More than a third are from the booming economies of China and Hong Kong.

The number of Russian pupils has risen by more than a quarter (27.4 per cent) in the past year, while the numbers of Chinese pupils are up 5.4 per cent and Nigerian students up 16.3 per cent.

Overall, there are now 25,805 non-British students with parents living overseas at UK fee-paying schools, up from 25,441 in 2012.

Almost 30 independent schools now have branches abroad educating 19,000 children.

ISC chairman Barnaby Lenon(CORR) said: ‘I am delighted that the numbers at independent schools have held up so well this year, despite the recession.’
