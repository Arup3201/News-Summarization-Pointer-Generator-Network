A set of twins who were born three months early and were not expected to survive are to start school this term.

Fraser and Ewan White suffered breathing problems, bleeding in the brain, heart defects and hernias and doctors said it was a miracle that they survived.

Now almost six years later, the boys are a picture of health and ready to start their first day of school - a date that their mother, Julie, 36, feared she would never see.

Fraser and Ewan White, now six, were born three months prematurely and it was feared that they would not survive. They both suffered breathing difficulties, bleeds on the brain and hernias

Stirling couple Julie, and Graham, 45, were over the moon when they were told they would be having twins.

But the babies developed twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome - a disease of the placenta that affects identical twin pregnancies - and the couple feared they would lose them.

Things went from bad to worse when one their babies developed the life-threatening condition absent end diastolic flow (AEDF), which stops the blood flowing through the umbilical cord properly.

Mrs White said: ‘Being told on the day of my 12 week scan that I was having twins was an incredible experience.

‘But from then on everything was just horrendous.

‘We had several TTTS scares, then at 25 weeks I was told that Ewan had AEDF and there was a chance he wouldn't survive because he couldn't breathe.’

Ewan had to be delivered as quickly as possible, but if he arrived too early, he would be too weak to survive.

‘It was awful, just awful’, Mrs White said.

‘Four weeks of just watching every second on the clock tick by.

‘It was the worst time of my life.’

The boys were eventually delivered at 29 weeks by an emergency Caesarean-section, and rushed off to intensive care where doctors fought to save them.

Fraser (pictured when he was seven-hours-old) was born with a hole in his heart and it was feared that he would have to have surgery to repair it. However, fortunately the hole repaired itself

Ewan (pictured when he was seven-hours-old) and Fraser were rushed straight from the operating theatre to intensive care and it was six hours before their mother knew if they had survived

Mrs White said: ‘I didn't even get to see them.

‘There was a team of about 17 people, and my babies were just rushed away.

‘I was left for about six hours before anyone could even tell me if they were alive or not.’

They had survived, but within days Mr and Mrs White were told they had suffered bleeding in their brains - a common complication of prematurity which can cause cerebral palsy - and that Fraser might require an operation to repair a hole in his heart.

In the womb, Ewan also developed the life-threatening condition absent end diastolic flow (AEDF), which stops the blood flowing through the umbilical cord properly

Thankfully the hole healed itself, but weighing just two and a half pounds, the boys had to be watched closely by doctors and nurses at the hospital for almost two months before doctors started to think about discharging them.

Then, just as Mr and Mrs White thought they would get to take their babies home, Fraser developed a hernia and was rushed to Yorkhill Children's Hospital, in Glasgow, to be operated on.

Because he was so small and fragile, doctors were worried he would not survive.

Mrs White said: ‘It was really hard that day because they discharged Ewan, and Fraser was taken away in an ambulance on his own to go for surgery.

The boys are now both healthy and are starting school. Their mother, Julie, says that she always told herself that they would be fine if they could reach their first day of school without any long term health problems

‘I was left with just one baby, and Graham was back at work by then.

‘It was really hard. I'd waited so long to take them home, but ended up taking one baby home for my sister to look after before driving to Yorkhill to be with the other one.’

But the problems did not stop there, and just 24 hours after Fraser was operated on, Ewan too developed hernia.

Mrs White said: ‘They were each in Yorkhill for two days and three nights.

‘They try under all circumstances to avoid giving general anaesthetic to babies under 4lbs because it's so risky.’

Mrs White said: 'Being told on the day of my 12 week scan that I was having twins was an incredible experience. But from then on everything was just horrendous with the pregnancy'

When Mrs White eventually got to take the twins home she was worried they would have lasting health problems.

She always told herself if they could reach primary school without any problems then they'd be in the clear.

Fraser and Ewan are starting school in the same class at St Ninians Primary School, Stirling, this term.

Mrs White said: ‘Having them home eventually was wonderful, but it took a very long time before I could relax.

‘They were just under 4lbs - and it was still before their due date.

‘I tried not to think about all that had happened, it was too distressing.

‘When you read about all the complications of premature births, you're preparing yourself for children with cerebral palsy or learning difficulties.

Mrs White says that she will be extremely proud when she sees the boys walk through the school gates for the first time. She says that they are now 'healthy, robust' children

‘To come through the TTTS, then the AEDF and the premature delivery and then the various complications, is a miracle.

‘It almost defied all medical explanation.

‘I always said if they could make it to primary one that would be them in the all-clear.

‘Now they're really healthy, robust kids.

‘When they walk through the school gates I'll be bursting with pride.

‘There will be a whole mix of emotions, it'll be really overwhelming, but it'll be wonderful.’
