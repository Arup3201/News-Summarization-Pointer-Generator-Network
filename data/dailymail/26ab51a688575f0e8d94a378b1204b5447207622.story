Speech: President Bashar Assad addresses Parliament today

Embattled Syrian president Bashar Assad today denied government involvement in the massacre of more than 100 people, nearly half of them children.

He claimed his forces had nothing to do with the slaughter in Syria's central Houla region and claimed not even 'monsters' would carry out such an ugly crime.

The shootings, many at close range, triggered international outrage and the expulsion of Syrian diplomats from world capitals.

Speaking to parliament in a televised 
address in Damascus, he warned the country was facing a 'real war' and once again 
blamed terrorists for the crisis.

The president said Syria was passing through its most critical stage since the end of colonialism. His message came after clashes broke out between 
pro and anti-Syrian groups in northern Lebanon.

At least eight 
people were killed between Friday night and Saturday morning, Lebanese security 
officials said.

The fighting in Lebanon pits Sunni 
Muslims who support Syrian rebels trying to oust Assad 
against members of the Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam of 
which Assad is a member.

Smoke billowed from several apartments
near the city's Syria street, the dividing line between the mainly 
Sunni Bab Tabbaneh neighborhood and the adjacent, Alawite-majority Jabal
Mohsen.

The area around Syria street was mostly empty except for gunmen
roaming the streets.

'We are being targeted because we 
support the Syrian people,' one Sunni gunman said. 'We are with you 
(Syrian people) and will not abandon you.'

The opposition and the government have 
exchanged accusations over the massacre with U.N. 
investigators claiming there were strong suspicions that pro-regime 
gunmen were responsible for at least some of the killings.

It was a rare public appearance by 
Assad since his crackdown on the 15-month uprising which is estimated by
the U.N. to have costs the lives of 13,000 people.

With the country spiralling to civil war, a six-point ceasefire plan brokered by international envoy Kofi 
Annan is violated by both sides every day despite 300-strong U.N. observers on the ground in Syria.

Meanwhile, Washington has reached out to Syria's most important ally and protector, urging Russia to join a coordinated effort to resolve the deadly conflict.

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton discussed the situation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in a telephone call yesterday, a senior State Department official said.

'They both agreed that we have to work together,' said an official. 'Her message to him was that we have to start working together to help Syrians with a serious political transition strategy.'

France says it will only participate in military action in Syria under a U.N. mandate. French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told an Asian security summit that the international community should increase sanctions and pressure in an effort to oust Assad.
