The fashion industry has always treated supermodel Twiggy well... or so she thought until she dug into her family's past.

The 1960s beauty icon's great-great grandmother was killed at a clothes sale in 1897, she discovered on the final episode of the latest series of the BBC's Who Do You Think You Are?

Trying to fight back laughter, Twiggy remarks: 'So the sales got her in the end. Bless her.'

Twiggy appears on the final episode of the series of the BBC's Who Do You Think You Are, and discovers that her great-great grandmother was killed in a 'crush' at a clothes shop

Twiggy, born Lesley Hornby, delved into her before-unknown family history, uncovering a tale of petty crime and poverty.

Her great-great grandmother, Grace Meadows, was punished for counterfeiting coins, after which she decided to live a crime-free life under her maiden name, Gillies, the Telegraph reported. 

In the BBC One ancestry show, which will be broadcast on October 9, Twiggy gasps as she reads out a report of her ancestor's death.

'Oh my goodness, oh my gosh. 1897, killed at a bargain sale! Oh I shouldn't laugh,' she says. 

'An inquest was held on Tuesday respecting the death of Grace Gillies, aged 69, who died during a great crush. 

'It was the first day of a great clearance sale and the doors were to be opened at 8 o'clock. She appeared to be ill and on being assisted to a seat said, "I have been beaten this time." 

'She went to a sale and she had a heart attack. They say your life flashes, you know, in front of you. She must have thought I got through all my criminal life, got through hard labour, became a respectable landlady, but the sales got her. Oh bless her heart.'

The former supermodel was a beauty icon in the 1960s, appearing on the covers of Vogue and Tatler

The programme also shows Twiggy visiting the shop where Grace died.

333-339 Mare Street, in Hackney, east London, was once Messers McIlroys shop, but is now a supermarket.

The Vogue and Tatler cover girl also learns that Grace's son, William, was sentenced to hard labour too after finding himself on the wrong side of the law.

Despite the hardship and differing lives many of her ancestors endured, Twiggy finds similarities between herself and her long-gone relatives.

'I think what this has shown me is that the women in my family are very strong women. I feel akin to them when I'm learning about them,' she says.
