DUI: Former ambassador to Iraq and Afghanistan Ryan Crocker

The former ambassador to Afghanistan and Iraq has been slapped with hit-and-run and drunken driving charges after he struck a semi-truck in his home state of Washington - and then drove away - earlier this month.

Ryan Crocker, 63, of Spokane registered a .160 blood-alcohol content - twice the legal limit - and a .152 in successive breath tests when was arrested August 14 in Spokane Valley, State Patrol Trooper Troy Briggs said.

Crocker, who was driving a 2009 Ford Mustang convertible, was stopped in the left lane at a red light.

When the light turned green, he tried to turn right across the path of the semi in the right lane, Briggs said.

The vehicles collided and Crocker's car spun out, but he kept driving, Briggs said. A witness followed him to a nearby bank and called police.

'He was very cooperative but obviously intoxicated,' Briggs said. "There was a pretty 
significant amount of damage to his vehicle.'

Crocker pleaded not guilty in court the next day, KXLY-TV reported. His lawyer, Julie Twyford, did not immediately return a call or email from The Associated Press on Thursday.

Crocker retired from the foreign service last month after serving three decades in some of the world's most dangerous hotspots, most recently Afghanistan.

An Arabic speaker and six-time ambassador, he came out of an earlier retirement last year to take the helm of the embassy at President Obama's request.

This year, Crocker announced he was retiring due to a serious health issue that he previously had while ambassador to Iraq.

He also ran embassies in Iraq, Pakistan, Kuwait, Lebanon and Syria during his long and distinguished career.

Crocker's resume is filled with close calls and d erring-do. The former top diplomat was in Beirut when the U.S. Embassy there was blown up in 1983, killing 63 people, including 17 Americans.
