It seems to be the done thing at the moment for footballers to post pictures of themselves with their heroes when they were young - and another Premier League star has done just that.

Aston Villa midfielder Jack Grealish unveiled a photograph on Twitter of himself as a youngster alongside his cousin, Sean Mills, and former England forward Paul Merson.

The ex-Arsenal, Middlesbrough and Portsmouth forward is pictured leaning out of his car next to Villa's Bodymoor Heath training ground and smiling for the cameras with the two young lads.
