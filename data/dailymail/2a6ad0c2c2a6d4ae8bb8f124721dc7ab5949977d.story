Jeremy Paxman has launched an astonishing attack on his employer the BBC, saying it is ‘smug’ and he hates much of its output.

In typically scathing style, the Newsnight presenter said the severance payoff scandal at the corporation – in which senior executives were handed £60million in ‘golden goodbyes’ – had produced a ‘great smell’.

And he added that the BBC’s commercial rivals are right to complain that it ‘distorts the marketplace’ with its vast, publicly funded news operation.

Paxman said: ‘[The BBC] is smug. I love the BBC in many ways, but at the same time it has made me loathe aspects of it, and that’s a very odd state of affairs.

‘When I see people being given £1million merely for walking out of the door, when I see £100million being blown on that DMI [digital media initiative] thing, a stupid technical initiative like that, I start wondering: how much longer are we going to test the public’s patience?’

In recent months, several of  Paxman’s colleagues – including John Humphrys and David Dimbleby – have openly criticised the BBC’s management.

But until now the 63-year-old has been relatively restrained.

The Newsnight presenter condemned the high level of pay-offs received by some senior BBC executives asking 'how much longer are we going to test the public's patience?'

He hit out at the size of the BBC, saying much of its content, such as its popular music stations, could be produced equally well by commercial broadcasters.

He told the Guardian newspaper: ‘There’s a pile of stuff on the BBC I can’t stand. My idea of hell is going down in one of the lifts in that ghastly new building [New Broadcasting House] in a lift which has Radio 1 Extra plumbed into it. I don’t quite understand why the BBC does Radio 1 Extra. I don’t really understand why it does Radio 1.

‘Clearly, you can meet those needs commercially. The BBC has got an unfortunate history of never seeing an area of broadcasting – or, increasingly, a web presence – without feeling the need to get into it itself.’

And he accused the BBC of using the licence fee to undermine its commercial rivals.

There is growing anger over how the corporation is able to challenge the country’s Press through its publicly funded news websites. Home Secretary Theresa May said last year that the BBC was ‘destroying local newspapers’.

Paxman said it was understandable that rival news organisations such as the Daily Mail dislike the fact the BBC is able to compete on ‘unfair terms’. He added: ‘There’s no argument that the BBC distorts the marketplace in online [news]. And I don’t think that has been really sufficiently grasped at a senior level.

‘It just happened, in the same way as has the proliferation of extra television channels, the proliferation of extra radio channels – and, going further back, the move into local radio.

‘These things just happened because the BBC is institutionally unable to countenance something without wanting to have it for itself.’

Paxman was equally cutting about the recent payoff scandal.

He said: ‘I don’t tar [director general] Tony Hall with this because he hasn’t been there long enough, but the great smell that comes off those payoff scandals – and I think they are scandals – is of an organisation which  became complacent, preoccupied with the conditions of its  senior staff, at the expense of a strategic vision.’

Earlier this year, Radio 4 presenter Humphrys said the BBC was ‘grotesquely over managed’ and has a ‘broadly liberal’ bias.  Dimbleby said the BBC was ‘too big for its own good’.

Last year, BBC Director of Television Danny Cohen warned its stars to stop attacking the corporation in public.

He said: ‘I’m finding a little too often that people who work for the BBC and are well rewarded for it are quick to attack or criticise the organisation.’
