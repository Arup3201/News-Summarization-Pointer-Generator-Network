For years, Sarah Mowbray tried in vain to track down the daughter she had been forced to give up for adoption as a toddler.

But with only first names to go on and no idea of the surname of the adoptive parents, she drew a blank.

As a last resort, she typed the name Kayleigh Marie into Facebook – and found herself looking at profiles of hundreds of women with that name.

Reunited at last: Sarah Mowbray, 41, with her long-lost daughter, Kayleigh Marie Watts, 22

Recognition: The pair were reunited after Sarah spotted a photo of her daughter on Facebook

Although
 it seemed like an impossible task, she sifted through each one until, 
astonishingly, she stumbled upon the picture of a twentysomething woman 
who bore an uncanny resemblance to her own younger self.

Convinced
 that Kayleigh Marie Watts could be the toddler she gave up for adoption
 19 years ago, 41-year-old Mrs Mowbray sent her a friend request – and 
within five minutes of messaging on the site the pair had confirmed 
their remarkable connection.

Mrs
 Mowbray and Miss Watts have been inseparable since meeting for the 
first time a week ago and yesterday celebrated their first Mothering 
Sunday together since 1995.

The
 delighted mother said: ‘I had been searching for Kayleigh for seven 
years but didn’t know the surname of her adoptive parents. In 
desperation I started searching for plain Kayleigh Maries on Facebook.

‘When
 I saw Kayleigh’s picture I thought she was the spitting image of me. As
 soon as we met I hugged her so tight I almost broke her neck. I can’t 
believe I’ve finally found her.’

Miss
 Watts, who had been living in Throckmorton, Worcestershire, less than 
20 miles from her birth mother’s home in Malvern, said: ‘It’s fantastic,
 like we have never been apart.

‘I
 had started searching for my birth mother three months earlier. I 
always knew we would be reunited, I just never imagined it would happen 
so soon.’

Mrs Mowbray gave 
Kayleigh up for adoption after social workers intervened because she was
 in a violent on-off relationship with the girl’s father.

She went on to have a son, Daniel, with another partner before marrying former farm worker Terry Mowbray, 39.

Mrs
 Mowbray, a full-time carer for her disabled husband, did not know what 
her daughter looked like when she typed ‘Kayleigh Marie’ into Facebook’s
 search facility last November. Stunned by Miss Watts’ close resemblance
 to her own appearance two decades earlier, she showed the picture to Mr
 Mowbray, who urged her to make contact.

Mrs
 Mowbray had also commissioned a tracing agency to try to track down her
 daughter. The agency had found a possible address and was writing to 
Miss Watts when Mrs Mowbray sent her a friend request.

Separated: Kayleigh Marie was taken from Sarah when she was just two and placed in foster care

Identical: The profile pictures Kayleigh posted on Facebook looked exactly like photos of Sarah at the same age

Miss
 Watts accepted the following morning and the pair began messaging. 
Minutes later, the connection was made when Mrs Mowbray said she was 
waiting for some important news about the daughter she had not seen for 
19 years.

Miss Watts asked 
what the daughter’s name was and was told it had been Kayleigh Marie 
Thomas but that she had been adopted. Miss Watts then simply replied: 
‘Mum!’

She followed it with 
another message: ‘I’m Kayleigh Marie. My last name was Thomas but then I
 was adopted’, and the pair then confirmed Miss Watts had the correct 
date of birth.

Relieved: Sarah says she now has the chance to be the mother she's always wanted to be to Kayleigh Marie

They spent 
five months messaging and texting each other until Miss Watts, who now 
lives in Worcester, plucked up the courage to meet her mother last week.
 Miss Watts, a care worker, said she has a strained relationship with 
her adoptive parents but gets on better with her older adoptive brother.

She
 bought Mrs Mowbray a purse, chocolates and candles for Mothering 
Sunday. She said: ‘It has been very emotional, it’s taken me six months 
to pluck up the courage to meet her and I’m so glad I did.

‘I’ve found my biological mum and we have loads in common. It was crazy to see that picture that looked just like me.’

Mrs Mowbray said: ‘I’m over the moon to have my daughter back. I now can hopefully be the mum I always wanted to be.’

Miss Watts’ adoptive parents declined to comment.
