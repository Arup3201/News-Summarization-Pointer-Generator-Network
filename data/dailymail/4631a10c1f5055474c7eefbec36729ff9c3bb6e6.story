John Hirst raked in millions from investors in the ex-pat community in Majorca where he lived

A conman who ripped off investors to live a life of luxury through a £5m investment fraud has been ordered to pay back just £650,000 to those he duped.

John Hirst raked in millions from investors in the ex-pat community in Majorca where he lived, and spent it on first-class travel, lavish weddings and extravagant hotels. 

He was jailed for nine years in August 2012 for masterminding the so-called 'Ponzi' scam - leaving many of the people he scammed financially ruined.

The plot was similar to the £41bn fraud for which United States financier Bernard Madoff was jailed for 150 years in 2009.

Hirst had moved to Spain after 
his release from jail for another bogus £500,000 investment scheme which
 involved defrauding Yorkshire miners out of their redundancy payments 
in the 1990s.

On Tuesday, Bradford Crown Court heard that the 64-year-old ex-salesman could only pay back a fraction of the £4.7m he swindled from his neighbours and friends over an eight-year period.

Judge Jonathan Durham Hall was told investigations by the Serious Fraud Office had led to an agreed figure of £4,717,042 that Hirst benefited from.

But prosecutor Lisa Freeman confirmed he only had available assets worth £650,522.94.

Just under £200,000 is already held by investigators and the outstanding amount is made up of cash gifts to people and money in other accounts. Hirst also owns a speedboat worth about £20,000.

Hirst and his co-conspirator Richard Pollett ran the fraud scheme between 2001 and 2009, persuading investors to hand over large sums to invest on the Dow Jones Index futures market with guaranteed returns of 18 percent a year plus a two percent bonus.

But while investors handed over around £10m, they only got back around £4m back.

Some of the investors were friends of Pollett, who they knew and trusted.

Bradford Crown Court heard previously that victims of the scheme were both in the UK and in the tourist and ex-pat community in Spain, many were elderly, investing their retirement nest egg - some got no money back.

Hirst's wife was 'literally showered' with 'money and jewels', and the couple enjoyed luxury holidays, while £270,000 was spent renovating the Hirsts¿ £1.5m villa in Majorca (pictured) and their Las Vegas wedding cost more than £90,000

Hirst’s wife was 'literally showered' with 'money and jewels', and the couple enjoyed luxury holidays, while £270,000 was spent renovating the Hirsts’ £1.5m villa in Majorca and their Las Vegas wedding cost more than £90,000.

The couple stayed at the exclusive Burj Al Arab Hotel in Dubai on the way to the Seychelles for their honeymoon and also held a £100,000 party an at exclusive Majorca hotel for friends following their wedding.

Hotels, holidays and flights were said to have cost just short of £160,000 with more than £25,000 spent on jewellery.

The couple also enjoyed taking cruises and spent more than £75,000 on a series of trips. Hirst also paid cash for a luxury home for his ex-wife and her daughter.

But in 2009 when there was a series of delays in payments to investors their plot began to unravel.

Soon the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) began an investigation into the scheme, called Operation Noble, alongside West Yorkshire and Surrey Police.

His wife Linda, laundered a total of £750,000, for which she was jailed for two-and-a-half years.

Pollett was jailed for six and a half years.

Compensation orders were made against both Linda Hirst and Richard Pollett last year.

Speaking after the sentencing hearing in August 2012, Charles Dewey, of Somerset, who formerly lived in Majorca and was a victim of the Ponzi fraud, said he and his family are having to start life again 'much in the manner of a student'.

'We have nothing left, we are on benefits, we are starting out again.

'The investment was £300,000, some of it we got back as income but we never were expecting to lose that capital.

'I think they are evil, I think I can speak of the other 120 investors, they have gone to a vulnerable group not big companies,' added Charles.

Judge Durham Hall agreed to make a formal compensation order against Hirst totalling £650,522.94 which will be paid to investors on a pro-rata basis.

Hirst has been given six months to pay the sum and was warned he faced another four years in jail if the cash is not handed over.
