Ronnie Biggs, who is unable to walk or talk because of a stroke, has finally expressed remorse over the death of the driver who never recovered from his assault during the Great Train Robbery - as he launched an updated version of his autobiography.

The deterioration of his health became apparent as he posed for the media at the launch in London, where he described himself as a 'loveable rogue'.

Unable to speak after several debilitating strokes, Biggs, 82, answered questions by pointing to a word and letter board.

Biggs's compared himself to Katie 
Price, saying he was the 'Jordan of the 1980s', and the Great Train 
Robber said he was proud of his achievements despite expressing remorse 
over his crimes.

When asked by reporters how the nation perceived him, Biggs spelled out: 'Loveable rogue.'

Son Michael Biggs, speaking on his 
father's behalf at the east London launch, said his father had no 
regrets about voluntarily returning from Brazil to face justice in 2001.

Michael Biggs described how his father developed a life-threatening chest infection every three or four weeks.

'It's a constant battle for my father,' he added.

'This is probably the first and last time he is holding a press conference.'

Biggs had been working on the book since his release from jail on compassionate grounds in 2009, the family said.

In an interview before the launch of 
Odd Man Out: The Last Straw, Biggs expressed sorrow over the fate of 
mail train driver Jack Mills, who died in 1970 having never made a full 
recovery after being coshed.

But when asked whether any proceeds 
from the book would go to Mr Mills' family, the ex-fugitive's son said: 
'That has not been discussed yet.'

The book updates his 1994 
autobiography and has chapters covering his later years, including his 
return to the UK, his time in prison, his release on compassionate 
grounds and his life since his release.

He first suffered a stroke in 1998 and has been admitted to hospital several times since returning to Britain in 2001.

Originally from Lambeth, south London,
Biggs was a member of a gang of robbers that stole £2.6m in one of the 
most infamous heists in history.

The 15-strong gang of robbers raided a
Post Office train from Glasgow to Watford after fixing a red signal to 
bring it to a halt at a lonely spot near in Buckinghamshire on August 8,
1963.

When the driver got out to investigate he was coshed and the gang escaped with 120 mail bags of bank notes.

The robbery left Mills with serious injuries. He never fully recovered from his injuries, and died seven years later.

Biggs says in his new book he is a 'very different man to the one who went on the run from HMP Wandsworth back in July 1965'.

'Not only are there many, many more 
miles on the clock, but also there is the damage done to my body and 
soul by the strokes and other health problems that should have killed me
already; and may have already done so by the time you get around to 
reading this,' he writes.

'I lay no claim to having been a 
perfect man who has led a faultless life, and never have, but I am a 
better man for the experiences of the past 50 years, a period in which I
spent over three quarters of my life trying to honestly maintain my 
family and myself as best I could.

'It has been said by those who don't 
know me - and who have never even met me - that I have no regrets, but 
that simply isn't true.

'I have always regretted the hurt I caused by my actions, and especially to my own family and friends.'

In an interview before the launch, 
Biggs had professed his regret by pointing out the words 'crime doesn't 
pay' on his word board.

When asked if he was sorry for what 
happened to mail train driver Jack Mills, who died in 1970 having never 
made a full recovery after being hit on the head, he pointed out: 'Yes.'

In reaction to Biggs' interview, the 
son of Jack Mills told ITV News that he didn't believe the robber's 
contrition and pointed out that Biggs is still making money from the 
crime with his book.
