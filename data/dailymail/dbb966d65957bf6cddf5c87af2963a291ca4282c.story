Cocaine worth £100million has been seized by Royal Navy sailors off the coast of Puerto Rico.

Sailors from HMS Lancaster seized 680kg of pure cocaine, made of 22 bales, after boarding a speedboat near the Caribbean island.

The Ministry of Defence said the 30ft speedboat, which was hidden by a tarpaulin, had been spotted by a U.S. Customs and Border Agency aircraft, prompting the bust.

The boat, which was carrying three people, was destroyed so it cannot be used in further drug smuggling

A lynx helicopter and high-speed pursuit boat were launched from the Portsmouth-based HMS Lancaster to intercept the vessel.

Three suspected smugglers threw the drugs overboard, but they were recovered by divers.

A total of 22 bales of pure cocaine were 
seized along with the three men. They, and the drugs, were handed over 
to the Coast Guard cutter Sapelo and then authorities in Puerto Rico.

The empty drugs boat was then sunk
 by Royal Navy gunfire - in line with standard procedure - to prevent 
its use in future smuggling operations.

The Type 23 frigate's commanding 
officer, Commander Steve Moorhouse, said it was the third success in as 
many weeks for the ship, which is working with US authorities as part of
 a joint effort to fight drug smuggling in the Caribbean.

'This
 is a great result, not only for Lancaster but also everyone involved in
 the multinational effort to stem the flow of drugs in the region,' he 
said.

'My ship's company can
 be incredibly proud of what they have achieved, their professionalism 
and teamwork continue to shine, and our close relationship with our 
partner nations and law enforcement agencies is proving to be hugely 
successful.'

He said in the past three weeks his crew have seized marijuana worth £700,000 and large quantities of heroin and cocaine.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond praised the crew's work today, saying: 'This extraordinary quantity of drugs has been stopped from reaching the streets by the swift actions of the Royal Navy, working closely with the U.S. Coastguard.

'This is HMS Lancaster's second 
counter narcotics patrol in the Caribbean to tackle the drugs trade and 
the entire ship's company should be proud of this remarkable 
achievement.

'This is 
another example of the skills and capability that mean our Armed Forces 
are held in high regard by our partners around the world.'

HMS
 Lancaster is currently on patrol with a team from the US Coast Guard 
Law Enforcement Detachment who provide intelligence in catching drug 
runners.

She is on her second counter-narcotics patrol of the Caribbean region and will continue to fight drug smuggling until the end of the year.

The patrols are part of Operation Martillo, a 15-nation effort to fight drug smuggling and to stop the movement of drugs from South America into the Caribbean and onwards to the UK.

Over the past year the U.S. Coast Guard has seized 45,195lb of cocaine and 8,500lb of marijuana during 22 law enforcement interceptions.

As well as counter-narcotic operations with the U.S., HMS Lancaster is carrying out other tasks across the Caribbean to support British interests, including providing reassurance and security for British Overseas Territories and the provision of humanitarian aid and disaster relief during the core hurricane season.
