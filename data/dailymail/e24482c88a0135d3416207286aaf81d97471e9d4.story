Across the fields and hedgerows around my Somerset home, bees are buzzing, crickets are chirping, and gathering swallows are twittering in the skies.

John Keats’s season of mists and mellow fruitfulness — autumn — is with us once again.

After last year’s washout summer, followed by a chilly winter and one of the coolest and latest springs on record, our wildlife is bouncing back.

Pick your own: Three young blackberry pickers in Kent, who have evidently sampled some of the fruit

In my own garden, in the lee of the Mendip Hills, nature is thriving.

The trees and bushes are dripping with fruit: green cider apples, ripening blackberries, and deep purple clumps of elderberries contrast with the gaudy crimson of the hawthorn. 

This free food supply attracts a constant stream of birds: from clumsy wood pigeons and perky blackbirds, to delicate little warblers such as the blackcap and lesser whitethroat, all gorging themselves on nature’s bounty from dawn to dusk.

In the old barn next door, the swallows are raising their second brood of young — in a race against time before the chill winds of October begin to blow, reducing the supply of flying insects they need to feed their hungry chicks. 

Meanwhile, in the clear blue skies overhead, the youngsters from the swallows’ previous brood are testing out their flying skills. 

This is vital, as very soon they will be heading south on the 5,000-mile journey to their winter home, near the southern tip of Africa.

For month after month at the start of the year we waited in vain for spring to arrive

Then, just as we were beginning to think the weather would never change, summer arrived with a bang

And for the first time in years, there are clouds of butterflies: the common or garden whites alongside small tortoiseshells, peacocks and red admirals. 

Many are feasting on fallen fruit, and becoming tipsy as they drink the fermenting juices of our apples, pears and plums. 

All these wild creatures are benefiting from one of the most bizarre years on record, weather-wise.

For month after month at the start of the year we waited in vain for spring to arrive. 

A cold February was followed by an even colder March, with bitter north-easterly winds blowing straight from Siberia. 

April showers failed to materialise, as winter seemed to go on for ever, in the coldest and latest spring for more than 50 years. 

After last year's disastrous wet summer, there were fears that some grassland butterflies such as the Adonis (pictured) and chalkhill blues would be in big trouble this year

Then, just as we were beginning to think the weather would never change, summer arrived with a bang. 

The first ten days of June were glorious, and the fine, sunny weather continued — especially in Southern Britain — throughout July and August. 

So how has nature responded to this unusual weather?

Classic signs of spring were long delayed: hawthorn blossom, bumblebees, and early butterflies such as the orange-tip all emerged weeks later than usual, while garden songsters such as the song thrush stayed silent well into the new year. 

After last year’s disastrous wet summer, there were fears that some grassland butterflies such as the Adonis and chalkhill blues would be in big trouble this year. 

Yet a one-hour count of chalkhill blues near Dorking in Surrey produced an incredible 3,200 butterflies — smashing the previous record of 825 from 2006.

This is because of the prolonged spell of fine, warm weather we enjoyed during the key time for these beautiful insects to emerge, in July and August. 

Richard Fox, of Butterfly Conservation, points out that the current spell of fine weather is good news for butterflies that spend the winter as hibernating adults, such as the comma, peacock and small tortoiseshell.

And in Northern England, the Durham Wildlife Trust has enjoyed a bonanza of meadow brown and ringlet butterflies, both of which suffered badly from last year’s summer holiday washout. 

They believe that this year’s late spring snowfalls meant that these butterflies hatched far later than usual, again coinciding with the long period of warm, settled weather in late May and June. 

The copious crop of berries this autumn is also down to the cold, late spring. Plants such as hawthorn, crab apple and rowan delayed flowering for weeks because of the chilly weather; so when warm, sunny conditions finally arrived they were able to take advantage.

Oaks also flowered late, ensuring a bumper yield of acorns across much of Britain.

Blackberries are several weeks behind schedule, but unless we get a spell of very wet weather we are due a huge crop. But bear in mind the old country saying that the devil ‘spits on blackberries’ on Michaelmas Day at the end of this month (September 29), rendering them inedible. 

Naturalists are talking of a ‘mast year’ — one in which trees produce lots of ‘mast’ (the fruit of beech, oak, chestnut, and other woodland trees).

This is very good news for those creatures that rely on fruits, nuts and berries to get them through the autumn and winter. Red squirrels and jays don’t just feast on acorns, but also bury them in special hiding places to provide food in the lean times ahead. 

Later on in the autumn, birds such as the fieldfare and redwing — thrushes that breed in Iceland, Scandinavia and Siberia — will arrive here in their millions. 

If the berry crop is as good as has been predicted, they will enjoy the benefits of this long, hot summer well into the winter ahead. 

But as with any period of unusual weather, 2013 hasn’t been a vintage year for all wildlife. 

National Trust nature guru Matthew Oates has noticed precious few hazelnuts, which is very bad news for dormice, and beechnuts are also at a low ebb. 

Other gardeners are reporting a remarkable lack of aphids — good news for rose-growers, but very bad news for one of our favourite insects, the ladybird.

So does the proliferation of fruits and berries foretell a hard winter, as many people believe?

Despite a wealth of ancient folklore and proverbs linking a good year for berries with a hard winter ahead, there is no evidence the two are connected.

As Matthew points out, the big harvest reflects what has gone, not what’s to come. 

What we can be sure of is that 2014 is likely to produce even more weather surprises for both us and for Britain’s wildlife.
