The daughter-in-law of the inventor of the iconic lava lamp drowned after falling into the River Avon while she walked her dogs.

Christine Craven-Walker, 70, was found after a huge police search near her £4.5million home in Little Somerford, near Chippenham, Wiltshire.

She fell into the river as she was walking the dogs, who were later found on the embankment, an inquest heard today.

It is thought that Mrs Craven-Walker may slipped as she was trying to get her dogs out of the water.

Wiltshire Police said her tragic death, on January 23, was not being treated as suspicious.

Mrs Craven-Walker was the daughter-in-law of Edward Craven-Walker, who invented the lava lamp

Mrs Craven-Walker, who lived with husband Tony in a £4.5million home which they bought from entrepreneur James Dyson 10 years ago, was the daughter-in-law of Edward Craven-Walker - the inventor of the lava lamp.

An inquest in Salisbury, Wiltshire, heard today that the 70-year-old's cause of death was drowning.  

The rural hamlet, where just 300 people live, was today in shock at Mrs Craven-Walker's death.

Little Somerford parish councillor Julie Frayling said: 'People are very shocked at what has happened. 

'This is a very close-knit community. 

'The River Avon goes passed and indeed under her home. She had two dogs and walked them every day.'

The inquest was adjourned to a date which is yet to be fixed.

The lava lamp was created by British inventor Edward Craven-Walker, who was inspired by an odd-looking liquid-filled egg timer he saw in a pub in southwest Britain.

The former World War II pilot then spent years transforming the concept into a home lighting accessory, having recognized the potential for such an invention during anything-goes '60s Britain.

Britain's 'Love Generation' saw an affinity between the fluorescent lava flow's unpredictable nature and the easy-going, drug-induced spirit of the decade, with the iconic lamp's popularity continuing well into the 1970s.

Lava lamps are based on two liquids of slightly different density which will not mix. The heavier liquid sinks to the bottom, but when heated by the lamp light its density decreases and it floats to the top.

They are still made in Britain today by company Mathmos, which still employs Mr Craven-Walker's tried and tested formula.
