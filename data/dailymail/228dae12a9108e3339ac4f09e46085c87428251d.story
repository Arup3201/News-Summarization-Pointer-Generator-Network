A foreign criminal jailed for a series of violent attacks cannot be deported because it would violate his human rights, it has been ruled.

Sanel Sahbaz, a Bosnian who now lives in Hertford, came to Britain as a child in 1993. Since 2005 he has committed a string of offences including common assault, handling stolen goods, theft, public order offences and assaulting police.

Shameless: Bosnian criminal Sanal Sahbaz has overturned a deportation order at the High Court in London today under ECHR Article 8 'Right to a family life'

Sahbaz has committed a string of offences since 2005 including common assault, handling stolen goods, theft, public order offences and assaulting a police officer

Violent: In one instance he attacked his landlord, pushing him to the floor and repeatedly kicking him and stamping on his head until he lost consciousness

In one incident he attacked his landlord, pushing him to the floor, repeatedly kicking him and stamping on his head until the man fell unconscious.

Sahbaz, 30, qualified for automatic deportation after he was jailed for four years, and the Home Office told him he would be sent home.

But he has now been told he can stay indefinitely after he brought a legal challenge under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right toÂ  private and family life.

His lawyers argued that if he was sent back to Bosnia it would separate him from his parents, brother and cousin, who are also in Britain, which would breach his rights.

Last night critics said that the ruling by a judge in the Immigration and Asylum Chamber reinforced the need for urgent reform of immigration laws.

When he was jailed for four years the Home Office was told he would be sent home but an appeal has ruled that he has a right to stay in Britain indefinitely
