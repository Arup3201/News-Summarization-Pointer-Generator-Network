The tiara Victoria Beckham wore for her wedding failed to sell at auction today.

It was expected that the coronet-style headpiece would fetch between £18,000 and £25,000 at the Bonhams sale in central London. It failed to reach the undisclosed reserve price, however, with the highest bid for the lot being £14,000.

The singer and fashion designer - then Victoria Adams - commissioned Irish jewellery designer Slim Barrett to make the gold and diamond tiara for her 1999 wedding to footballer David Beckham.

The gold and diamond 'East of Paris' coronet, worn by Victoria Beckham on her wedding day, was valued at £18,000-£25,000 and designed by jeweller Slim Barrett

The fairytale piece, which was exhibited by the Victoria and Albert Museum in its 100 Tiaras, Past And Present show, is made from 18-carat yellow gold, set with large brilliant-cut diamonds and suspended diamond drops.

After the wedding, It was kept by Barrett, who has collaborated with Chanel, Versace and John Galliano and designed pieces for Sir Mick Jagger and Diana, Princess of Wales, and was put up for sale as part of Bonhams' auction of fine jewellery in New Bond Street, London.

Auctioneer Matthew Girling, chief executive of Bonhams UK and Europe, described the piece as being 'something unique' before starting the bidding at £10,000.

When it failed to sell, Mr Girling said: 'It didn't find a home today, I'm afraid, and lives to fight another day. You missed a golden opportunity here in the room and on the phones and online, is all I can say.'

However while the tiara may have failed to reach its reserve price, author Barbara Taylor Bradford's stunning jewellery collection has fetched almost £1 million at auction.

Despite much media attention in the run-up to the sale, no one was willing to buy the lavish piece

The 80-year-old, who has no children,
 said she was 'delighted' to have raised so much money, which she is 
giving to two distant female relatives.

The author of 'A Woman of Substance' sold diamond rings, ornate brooches, necklaces and bracelets.

Slim Barrett is an Irish born jewellery artist and master metalworker

Her
 cushion-shaped, 14-carat David Morris diamond ring went to a phone 
bidder for £446,500 at the Bonhams' Fine Jewellery Sale in central 
London.

A spectacular Harry Winston sapphire and diamond ring made £182,500 and a 19th century sapphire and diamond brooch made £116,500.

A pair of David Morris diamond earclips raised £92,500 and pearl and diamond pendant earrings by Harry Winston made £80,500.

In all, her 40-item collection - mostly presents from her TV producer husband Robert Bradford - raised £980,000.

The
 best-selling author said: 'I am delighted with the result of the sale 
and wish those who were lucky enough to have bought a piece of my 
jewellery as much joy from it as I have had.

'The jewellery has 
been part of my life for such a long time but I'm glad it will begin a 
new chapter, with a new owner, in a new home.

'Beautiful things 
need to be displayed and admired and I'm so pleased that the jewellery 
will live again and be cherished and enjoyed.

'That's how it should be.'

Each
 piece was accompanied by a short description of its history compiled by
 the author, including personal details such as when and why her husband
 gave it to her.

This sapphire and diamond ring, designed by Harry Winston made £182,500 at the auction, the proceeds of which Barbara intends to give to two female relatives

The couple's 50th wedding anniversary is on Christmas Eve.

Miss Taylor Bradford initially thought of giving the collection to the two women, who are described as 'wider family members".

The romantic novelist, now 80, who has no children, said she was 'delighted' to have raised so much money, which she is giving to two distant female relatives

But
 she came to the conclusion that the gems are not something they would 
want or wear 'as they don't lead the same lifestyle as me'.

She said: Bob and I decided it might be nice to auction it and the money will be
 a little nest egg for them. Let somebody else enjoy those beautiful 
things.'

She added: 'I happen to have a very generous husband and he's really bought everything that is going on auction.

'I
 did say: "Is that alright? Are you agreeing to this?' And he said 'Yes,
 of course. I bought it but I gave it to you and it's yours and you can 
do what you like with it.

'I remember once for instance we were in 
vacation in Capri and I was reading on the terrace after breakfast and 
he said: 'I'm just going for a walk to buy a newspaper'.

'A little 
while later he returned with a large shopping bag full of newspapers. 
And then he suddenly reached in to the shopping bag and said: 'I've 
bought you some flowers'. Flowers indeed! Sapphire, multi-coloured 
flowers in a necklace. He does things like that all the time.'

'It's a
 wrench, but at the same time I've enjoyed those pieces and I'd had them
 for years and a lot of times they had remained in the safe.

'They should be being worn by another person, another woman.

'The husband should be buying it for her. I don't believe in buying your own jewellery if you're a woman.'

Miss
 Taylor Bradford and her husband have tried to start a family in the 
past but the author has admitting having two miscarriages.

Yorkshire-born Miss Taylor Bradford has sold over 88 million books in more than 90 countries.
