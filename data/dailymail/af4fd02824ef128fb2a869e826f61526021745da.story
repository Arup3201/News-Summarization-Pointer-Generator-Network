The former Conservative Cabinet Minister Owen Paterson, sacked from the role by David Cameron last month, has been 'treated to lunch' by a millionaire Ukip donor, it has been claimed.

Mr Paterson, who was axed by the Prime Minister as Environment Secretary in July, reportedly dined with Crispin Odey, a hedge fund boss.

The lunch meeting was revealed just days after Tory MP Douglas Carswell defected to Ukip and resigned from Parliament - sparking a crunch by-election.

According to the Mirror, Ukip-backer Stuart Wheeler believes a further two Tory Eurosceptics are giving serious consideration to following suit and joining Nigel Farage's party.

In the past, Mr Odey, of Odey Asset Management, has criticised David Cameron claiming he 'doesn't understand power and he doesn't use it'.

The Mirror quotes Mr Wheeler as saying he had asked eight anti-Brussels Conservatives about their views, adding: 'But I didn't say "will you defect?" I would say "would you like to meet Nigel Farage?".

'Some of them said yes, and Douglas Carswell was one, and he's the only name I can give you.'

He told the newspaper that if Mr Carswell were to triumph in the Clacton by-election 'other Conservative MPs who are on the brink will be encouraged to defect as well.'

Mr Paterson was still Environment Secretary when the lunch is said to have taken place last autumn with Mr Odey, a former Tory donor. 

This afternoon the North Shropshire MP's office confirmed that he had a 'private dinner with Crispin Odey, who he knows from his days in the leather trade.'

The spokesman added: 'It was just the two of them, there were no other MPs present and he would reiterate that the only way of securing an EU referendum is to vote Conservative.'

Mr Odey's company has been contacted for a comment this morning.
