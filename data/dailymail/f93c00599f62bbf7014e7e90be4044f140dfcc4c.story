How do your fingers measure up? If you’re a man, it could reveal more about you than you thought.

Researchers say that the length of a man’s index finger compared to his ring finger on his right hand is an indicator of his testicle size.

And the study claims that the digit ratio could be used to predict testicle volumes of any male.

Researchers in South Korea say finger ratios affect the size of testicles. Men with larger testes were found to have longer ring than index fingers. The study was based on 172 Korean men aged 20 to 69 years old. In the image above, the man with hand on the left would have smaller testicles than the one on the right

The study was carried out by South Korean researchers from the Department of Urology at Gachon University Gil Hospital in Incheon and Seoul National University Hospital.

A previous study revealed that the size of men's and women's index and ring fingers is an indication of how attractive they are to the opposite sex.

According to the findings, a woman whose index finger is longer than her ring finger is likely to have a symmetrical and more appealing face.

For men, it is the opposite - those whose ring fingers are longer than their index fingers are more likely to be attractive to women. 

The discovery was made by Bernhard Fink of the University of Vienna, who measured the fingers of 100 men and women and photographed their faces using a digital camera. He used a computer programme to assess the symmetry of each face.  

They found that adult males with a ring finger longer than their index finger on their right hand had larger testicles.

Conversely, men with a longer index finger compared to their ring finger have smaller testicles.

Prior to the study it had already been suggested that second to fourth digit ratio correlated with the male reproductive system.

This was based on the finding that Hox genes - which help lay out how a person’s body takes shape - control finger development and genital development during the embryonic stage.

Previous research has suggested that the size of a man's testicle correlates with the volume of semen he produces.

In the study a total of 172 Korean men aged 20 to 69 years, already hospitalised for urological surgery, were enrolled.

First, the researchers measured the length of the second and fourth digits of each participant.

Then, separately and independently, an experienced urologist measured their testes size.

The results then showed that digit ratio was inversely proportionate to adult testicular volume - meaning that a longer ring finger correlated to larger testicles and vice versa.

In the study the researchers also found that age and height did not have much effect on testicular volume, while weight had a marginal correlation.

In the study the fingers and testicles of the volunteers were measured in size independently and highlighted the correlation between finger and testicle size. However in the research no correlation between testicle size and age or height was found
