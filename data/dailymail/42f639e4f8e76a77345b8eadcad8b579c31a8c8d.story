Mario Balotelli's late winner against Tottenham on Tuesday night ensured that Liverpool have picked up more points since Christmas than any other Premier League side.

Brendan Rodgers' men are the only unbeaten team in the games played since December 25, winning six times and drawing twice.

That run of form has seen them pick up an impressive 20 points from a possible 24, a tally which would have them two points above Arsenal at the top of the table had the season started on Boxing Day.

The Gunners took their post-Christmas points tally to 18 with a home win against struggling Leicester on Tuesday, after first-half goals from Laurent Koscielny and Theo Walcott proved decisive.

Arsene Wenger's men have suffered two defeats - at Southampton and Tottenham - but have won each of their other games to move into fourth place in the Premier League table.

Arsenal would be second if the season had begun on December 26, with Spurs and Southampton filling the remaining two Champions League places.

Despite defeat at Anfield, Mauricio Pochettino's men have picked up 16 points from a possible 24 - the same amount as Ronald Koeman's Saints.

Chelsea and Stoke, who face champions Manchester City on Wednesday, both have 14 - totals which would have them sat fifth and sixth in the table.

Daley Blind salvaged a draw for Manchester United at West Ham on Sunday and that point sees Louis van Gaal's men on 12 points since Christmas, just one more than Crystal Palace.

The Eagles have been in fine form since the appointment of Alan Pardew last month and have won three of their four top-flight games since the former Newcastle boss took charge at Selhurst Park.

Manchester City have experienced perhaps the most worrying drop in form since Christmas, picking up just 10 points from their seven games.

Manuel Pellegrini's men are still second in the league but they're ninth in our alternative table, having won just twice in their last seven matches.

There's even more cause for concern at the bottom, with Aston Villa having earned just two points from their eight games since December 25.

Paul Lambert's side - who dropped into the relegation zone after defeat at Hull on Tuesday - are bottom of the table since Boxing Day, having scored just one goal.
