Dallas Cowboys defensive lineman Jay Ratliff has been arrested on suspicion of driving while intoxicated just a little over a month after tragedy struck the team in a similar fashion.

The 31-year-old nose tackle was arrested shortly after midnight after his pickup truck sideswiped a semitrailer truck on Texas 114 in eastern Grapevine, 20 miles northwest of Dallas.

No one was injured, but Ratliff failed a field sobriety test and was taken to city jail, said Grapevine police Officer Sam Shemwell.

Jailed: No one was injured, but Ratliff failed a field sobriety test and was taken to city jail

Ratliff declined a breath test, but police obtained a blood sample for testing, Shemwell said.

Cowboys spokesman Rich Dalrymple declined comment.

The case will go to the Tarrant County district attorney's office in Fort Worth, Shemwell said. If convicted, Ratliff could get up to six months in jail.

Ratliff was limited to six games this season with ankle and groin injuries.

The arrest came less than a month after fellow Cowboys player Josh Brent was indicted on an intoxicated manslaughter count in the December 8 crash that killed his friend and Cowboys practice squad member Jerry Brown.

Both Ratliff and Brent play the same position - nose tackle.

Brent remains free on $100,000 bond.

Police in the Dallas suburb of Irving say Brent was speeding when his vehicle struck a curb and flipped.

Brown was pronounced dead at an area hospital.

A subsequent investigation found that 
Brown was not intoxicated at the time of the crash, but Brent was two 
times the legal limit.

Brent's
blood alcohol level was 0.18, meaning a person his weight would have to
drink about 20 shots over a four-hour period to reach that level.

Intoxication manslaughter carries a 
maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, but Brent could be eligible for 
probation if convicted.

An autopsy found that Dallas Cowboys practice squad player Jerry Brown Jr was sober when he was killed.

Fatal:
Police say Brent had a blood alcohol limit of 0.18 percent - more than 
twice the legal limit - when he crashed his Mercedes in Dallas and 
killed his teammate

The Dallas County Medical Examiner's 
Office reported Thursday that Brown died of head and neck trauma when 
their vehicle overturned.

He
had a dislocated neck, a severely bruised spine and a blood alcohol 
content of 0.056 per cent. That's well below the Texas drunken driving 
standard of 0.08 per cent.

Police have said Brent had a blood alcohol level twice the legal 
limit when after the December 8 crash in Irving, a Dallas suburb.

The medical examiner’s report stated 
that Brown, 25, sustained abrasions on the right and left forehead and a
cut on his left eyebrow.

Neither man was wearing a seatbelt at the time of the collision, according to officials.

Cowboys coach Jason Garrett has said that the team would continue to support Brent despite the revelation.

'Josh
is a member of our family and we will continue to support him in every 
way that we can and at the same time try to help other people who are in
a similar kind of situation.'

A number of witnesses came forward to say that Brown was alive and screaming for help after Brent crashed the car.

Stacee McWilliams, 40, from Irving, told police that when she stopped at the scene of the  accident, she practically had to beg Brent to help his best friend out of the Mercedes, which was upside down and on fire.

She said: 'I jumped out and ran out toward the wreck. I yelled to Brent, "Are you OK? Are you OK?" And he told me he was fine as he was pacing back and forth.

'I was relieved because I thought, it’s just a single-car accident, nobody’s hurt. And then fire sparked up from the car and got bigger and I started to hear screams.

Brent’s attorney, George Milner, called McWilliams’ account 'absolutely false'.

'What I’ve been told is that Jerry Brown was never conscious after the accident,' Milner said. 'This woman, while present in the area of the accident, could not have seen or heard anything she said about Josh.

It is now believed that the two close friends started their night at Eddie V's restaurant in Oak Lawn before moving on to a night club in northwest Dallas, CBS DFW reported.

The Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission has launched an investigation to determine whether the two football players were over-served, and if so, by whom.

Eddie V's released a statement, saying in part that the establishment takes 'the responsibility that comes with serving alcohol very seriously.'

It was not Brent's first run-in with the law - or intoxication charge.

In February 2009, Brent was arrested in February 2009 near the Illinois campus for driving under the influence, driving on a suspended license and speeding, according to Champaign County, Illinois.

In June 2009, he pleaded guilty to DUI and was sentenced to 60 days in jail, two years of probation, 200 hours of community service and a fine of about $2,000.

As part of his plea deal, prosecutors dropped one count of aggravated DUI/no valid driver's license. Brent successfully completed his probation in July 2011, court records show.

The Cowboys had signed Brown to their practice squad on October 24, but he hasn't been on the active roster. He was released from the Colts' practice squad on October 20. Brown played in one game for the Colts, a loss to the New York Jets on October 14.
