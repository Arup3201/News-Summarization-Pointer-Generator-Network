Escape: The manhunt for Andrew Farndon is over after he was captured following a two-day search

A dangerous prisoner who went on the run has been arrested – hours after his mother made a TV appeal for him to give himself up.

Andrew Farndon was held by police on Friday in New Cumnock, Ayrshire.

He was 360 miles from the scene of his escape in Bury St Edmunds on Wednesday when two guards escorting him to hospital were threatened at gunpoint.

Three other men and a woman have also been arrested and detained for allegedly ‘attempting to pervert the ends of justice’.

Last night the prisoner’s mother, Kate Farndon, said: ‘It has taken a great weight off my mind. I had this terrible fear that he would be cornered and shot down in a hail of bullets.

‘My son is not the monster everyone has been making him out to be. I just hope he gets fair treatment and that he is safe back in prison.’

David Ruffley, Tory MP for Bury St Edmunds, last night called for prison officers on escort duties to be armed.

He said: ‘I am very concerned that a dangerous prisoner was on the loose. The guards should have been capable of resisting intimidation by an armed accomplice of the prisoner.’

Farndon, 26, was jailed five years ago for a ferocious attack on a man with a baseball bat and a hammer that left his victim with a fractured 
skull. He was found guilty of grievous 
bodily harm and jailed but officials only classed him as a category C prisoner - meaning
he was deemed unlikely to make a determined escape attempt.

A nationwide manhunt was launched after a male accomplice pointed a gun at the head of a female prison officer and ordered her to free him from his handcuffs.

Farndon was being transported to the West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmunds for treatment after apparently stabbing himself in the shoulder while at Highpoint prison in Stradishall, Suffolk.It was the second time Farndon had escaped from custody.

At his trial at Coventry Crown Court 
in April 2007 he escaped from the dock after a judge ordered him to be 
detained for an indefinite period for the protection of the public. He 
was recaptured 22 days later in Witley, Surrey.

A spokeswoman for Suffolk Police 
said: 'On Friday officers from Strathclyde Police arrested Andrew 
Farndon in New Cumnock, Ayrshire.

'He is currently detained in police custody.

'A
further four people, three men aged 16, 33, 43 and a woman, aged 44, 
have been arrested and are presently detained in police custody for 
allegedly attempting to pervert the ends of justice.

'It is anticipated that all four will appear at Ayr Sheriff Court on Monday January 30.'

Staff alert: Employees at West Suffolk Hospital reported seeing a man wielding a gun, which he aimed in the direction of two officers who were guarding Farndon

Forces
across Britain, including the neighbouring counties of Norfolk, Essex 
and Cambridgeshire, along with West Midlands Police, had issued appeals 
for information.

Just hours before Farndon's arrest, his mother made a public appeal urging him to contact police.

Asking
her son to hand himself in on Sky News, Kate Farndon said: 'Hi Andy 
love, it's mum. I would like to know that you're ok, I would like to 
know how your wound is, if it's serious, if you need medical attention, 
but most of all sweetheart, I would like you to hand yourself in.

'This just isn't going to help anything. Please, please, love, hand yourself in.'

Yesterday detectives released an e-fit likeness of the gunman who assisted Farndon in his escape.

He is described as white, in his 
mid-40s, around 5ft 8ins tall, of stocky build, possibly with a Scottish
accent and wearing a white top and blue jeans.

The release of Farndon is the second in a week after John Anslow (pictured) was sprung from a prison van

The escape is the second in just a 
week, after category A prisoner John Anslow was sprung from a prison van
after it left Hewell Prison in Worcestershire, though there is no 
suggestion both escapes were linked.

Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke has 
ordered an inquiry into how Anslow, described as 'extremely dangerous' 
by police, became the first category A prisoner to escape in more than 
17 years on Monday.

Instead of being transferred in a 
high-security prison service van with a police escort, Anslow was with 
other inmates in a van run by a private contractor.

Three masked men ambushed the van, 
smashing its windows with sledgehammers and punching the driver as he 
was transporting inmates from the prison near Redditch to Stafford Crown
Court on Monday morning.

An international manhunt has been 
launched for Anslow with police liaising with other UK forces, the UK 
Border Agency and foreign authorities.

The search extends to all airports and railway stations. Anslow, also known as Skitz, has strong connections across the country, including London, as well as overseas, police said.

A 44-year-old Tipton man arrested on 
Monday night on suspicion of helping Anslow to escape was released on 
bail pending further inquiries, police said.
