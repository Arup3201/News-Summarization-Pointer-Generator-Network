Seven years after Three Lions first decorated his white shirt, a young man from Surrey was entrusted with the task of briefly upsetting some of his kith and kin.

Yet, when Chris Martin returns to Derby County on Wednesday morning, a fifth Scotland cap in his possession, he will surely do so with a heavy heart and consumed with feelings of deep regret.

One of the more recent conscripts to Gordon Strachan’s squad, the 26-year-old was granted his first start in Dark Blue in Steven Fletcher’s injury-enforced absence.

Frankly, though, over the course of 45 minutes, the former England Under-19 player did little to suggest the Scotland manager would be able hang his hat on him in the future should the need arise.

Truthfully, it was a chastening night for almost every member of the home side. It proved to be a crushing low after the elation of victory over Ireland on Friday, with the only crumb of consolation that it didn’t come in a competitive match.

Martin was by no means the only player to fall way short of the standard required at this level but as the only change in the home side’s starting line-up over the two games, his shortcomings were all the more glaring.

He lasted only until half-time before being replaced by Darren Fletcher – with Steven Naismith pushed forward - and his withdrawal was about as inevitable as day following night. Whether he is afforded another such gilt-edged opportunity is a matter of some conjecture.

In mitigation, a chronic lack of service undoubtedly contributed to an underwhelming display but it was still distinctly cumbersome and uncertain.

As England dominated the early exchanges, that settling first touch every striker craves proved elusive. When it finally came, the breath of Chris Smalling was on Martin’s neck and the ball was smuggled to safety by the men in white. It set a depressing tone for the striker.

Those entrusted with the No 9 shirt in Strachan’s favoured 4-2-3-1 system, can find the position both a blessing and a curse.

When the wind is in the sails, the opportunities created by the three supporting players seem boundless. When defensive diligence is called for – as was often the case last night – it must feel like the loneliest of roles.

Even accounting for that, Martin generally struggled to hold the ball up and drag others into play. For a big lump of a man, his direct opponents were untroubled. To coin the old phrase, he seemed to leave much out there.

Brief moments of promise were invariably followed by a clumsy touch. When Ikechi Anya or Shaun Maloney stole a yard on the flank, the Derby man always appeared yards shy of connecting with a cross.

When he attempted a reverse ball or a cross-field pass, his appreciation of the wider game was not what it should have been. The harder he tried, the less things came off for him.

Steven Fletcher may have failed to hit the net in what has been an interrupted five-and-a-half years at international level but Martin’s movement looked measurably inferior to the man for whom he deputised last night. At times, he couldn’t do right for doing wrong.

One moment in particular summed up his contribution. Having dropped inside his own half to instigate an attack, he showed a deft first-touch and held Gary Cahill off. Yet, the subsequent pass to Andrew Robertson was a yard behind the full-back and the ball trundled straight out of play.

Strachan, as we well know, just doesn’t do hands-on-hips bystanders. It’s one thing holding the position to create an out-ball but defending set-pieces was as much a part of Martin’s detail as ruffling the feathers of Smalling and Gary Cahill.

He did what he could in that regard, but in the real things that mattered – ball retention, playing others in, being an aerial threat – he rated poorly.

And yet for all that, Strachan appears to be very much in his fan club.

A yardstick of Martin’s standing in manager’s eyes isn’t so much the fact he’s now first deputy to Fletcher but the calibre of player he is presently keeping out of the squad.

Fellow Championship strikers Jordan Rhodes and Ross McCormack come with £8million and £11m price tags, respectively, on their shirts these days, yet the man who joined Derby County under freedom of contract a year ago has elbowed them both out of the way. It will be interesting to see if he remains the blue-eyed boy for much longer.

On this evidence, the aforementioned pair must wonder when – or indeed if – the door to international football will open again. Certainly, both Johnny Russell and Stevie May, who were both given late run-outs here, have little to fear in terms of the competition nipping at their heels
