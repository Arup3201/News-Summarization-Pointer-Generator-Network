As one of the fastest growing cities in the world, Shanghai's mushrooming skylie should come as no surprise.

Yet a cinematographer has managed to capture the Chinese city's growth with a video so stunning it makes the jaw drop.

Taken from the 23rd floor of a building, producer Joe Nifas used a time-lapse video to document the surge in sky-high buildings which lends the city its futuristic look.

The inventive video shows the dramatic extent to which the landscape has changed

The two-minute long video showcases how from a sparse piece of land iconic buildings have popped up, making the district one of China's most powerful financial and commercial hubs.

Mr Nafis, who has lived in the city since 2004, told the NY Daily News he wanted to convey the awe-inspiring progress of Shanghai.

The 27-year-old, from California, said: 'My motivation for this video was really to show my family the view from my apartment and the things I've seen over the years.'

'They've visited once, but it's hard to grasp what it's like living in such a huge, vibrant city in only a few days.'

By the beginning of 2005 some 6,704 buildings of 11 stories or more had been constructed in just 15 years

The city's financial hub is perched on the bank of the Yangtze Rover, and is a focal point of Shanghai

As the city continues to bloom, the number of skyscrapers continues to multiply

1. Shanghai World Financial Center 1,614ft  2. Oriental Pearl Tower 1,535ft3. Jin Mao Tower 1,380ft 4. Shimao International Plaza 1,093ft5. Shanghai Wheelock Square 974.5ft

Dust and earth billow out in clouds as the march of progress continues, with green spaces wiped away for the concrete and glass structures.

Cranes can be seen perched on the top of the towering blocks as constructors work to make the constructions even taller.

The easily-recognised Shanghai Tower emerges from the ground to join the surrounding skycrapers in the Pudong district.

During the video the district goes from being a neglected-looking neighbourhood to a nest of office blocks perched on the bank of the Yangtze river.

The video shoots the city at a variety of
 times, from sunset when the morning mist burns over the polluted 
streets, to nighttime when the whole place is lit up by office blocks.

Shanghai's unstoppable skyline rise has boomed within the last 23 years.

By the beginning of 2005 some 6,704 buildings of 11 stories or more had been constructed in just 15 years.

Shanghai's unstoppable rise has boomed within the last 23 years, and the city lights up the night sky

By the start of 2012, there are 165 high-rise buildings either under construction, approved for construction, or proposed for construction

By 2011 there more this figure had risen to an astonishing 20,000 buildings with 11 stories or higher and the city housed more than 1,000 buildings exceeding 30 stories.

By the start of 2012, there are 165 high-rise buildings either under construction, approved for construction, or proposed for construction.

Three of these are expected to reach over 300m (980 ft) high.

As one of the fastest-growing cities in the world, Shanghai is said to have an economy that competes with Finland, The Huffington Post reported.

Today the city is home to more than 23 million people, compared to just 11 million in 1987.

It is now one of the world's most populated cities and one of China's largest. 

But while the construction industry booms and the skyscrapers grow, there have been dire consequences for residents' health.

Smog in China’s most populated city is being blamed for a fertility crisis as the incidence of low sperm counts among its men reaches record levels.

Doctors in financial capital Shanghai say air and water pollution is a ‘major culprit’ for the city’s predicament and warn that action needs to be taken urgently.

‘If we don’t protect the environment now, mankind will face a worsening infertility predicament,’ Dr Li Zheng, a sperm expert at the city’s Renji Hospital told the Shanghai Morning Post.
