A man has died after he fell down the stairs on a double-decker bus in Greater Manchester, police have said.

The 46-year-old man, who has not been named, was climbing the stairs of the bus with a crutch in his right hand when he fell backwards on to the floor in front of his horrified partner.

Shocked passengers called 999 and the man was rushed to hospital but later died.

The man and his partner boarded the 383 Stagecoach bus on Longshut Lane, Stockport, around 5.30pm last night.

The man had a carrier bag in his left hand and a crutch in his right hand.

The man’s partner went upstairs to the upper deck of the bus and the man followed, but when he had got halfway up the steps, he fell backwards onto the floor of the bus.

The North West Ambulance Service confirmed they were called to the scene last night and took the man to hospital in Steppinghill, Stockport.

The man had suffered a head injury but died late last night.

Inspector Matthew Bailey-Smith from GMP’s Serious Collision Investigation Unit said: 'We are appealing for any witnesses who were travelling last night at around 5.30pm on the 383 bus, which goes from Stockport town centre to the Marple Bridge area, to please get in touch with us.

'Our sympathies are with the man’s family at this very difficult time and we are carrying out enquiries to establish the circumstances surrounding this man’s fall and how he came to suffer his head injury.'

Police are appealing for anyone who saw it happen on the 383 Stagecoach bus, which runs from Stockport town centre to Marple Bridge, to contact them.
