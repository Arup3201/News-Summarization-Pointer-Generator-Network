Every elderly patient will have their own NHS worker responsible for both their health and care needs, the government announced today.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said dedicated ‘case managers’ would oversee support for all medical needs, in a bid to ease pressure on under-strain A&E departments.

The move would see one health professional would track patients as they moved between hospitals, GP surgeries, care homes and their own houses.

Mr Hunt used a speech in the Commons today to unveil a major overhaul of care for elderly patients.

The way hospitals are set up to support frail and elderly people in emergencies, particularly those with dementia, will be reviewed.

Mr Hunt told MPs: 'It will require a great deal of careful work asking some difficult questions and making some tough decisions.

'But if it leads to more personal care, more integrated and more compassionate care, then it stands alongside the care bill as an important step forward in reforming the care received by millions of people.'

He warns that dementia has overtaken cancer as the biggest challenge the NHS faces, with 40 per cent of people being cared for in hospital when they could be treated elsewhere.

The use of payment by results will be curbed, amid fears it is skewing the way some treatment is given.

Out-of-hours care will also be overhauled, with GPs having access to every patients’ detailed notes no matter where they live or are being treated.

Ministers are also considering giving older patients one-to-one care from a named NHS worker.

Mr Hunt said: ‘Nobody disagrees with the concept of a case manager.

‘But now we have to make a reality of that - because unless we do that we won't solve the long-term issues around A&E pressures - and much more importantly we won't give vulnerable elderly people the kind of care that the NHS has always been proud to give,’ he told The Independent.

‘The delight of an ageing population is we all live so much longer but it does mean that we have to cope with years of ill health at the end of our lives that perhaps we didn't have to cope with before.’

Under changes to payment by results, hospitals and GPs will be encouraged to look at care holistically .

Regulator Monitor and NHS England are examining how the hospital payment system 'can do more for patients'.

But Labour warned that patients caught up in the ‘A&E crisis’ would take little comfort from the plans.

Jamie Reed MP, Labour's shadow health minister, said: ‘If ministers think they've found the answer to the problems in England's A&Es, they are sorely mistaken.

‘Labour has called for a single point of contact to co-ordinate older people's care needs, but patients waiting hours on end in A&Es tonight will take little comfort from this announcement.

‘Cuts to social care services have left greater numbers of older people attending A&E because they aren't getting the support they need. A&Es are suffering from the break-up of the successful NHS Direct service and the closure of NHS walk-in centres across England.

‘Thousands of nursing jobs have been axed on David Cameron's watch, leaving hospitals understaffed too.

‘Ministers must accept responsibility and act quickly to stop loss of nursing jobs, sort out the 111 service and prevent the social care system from collapse.’
