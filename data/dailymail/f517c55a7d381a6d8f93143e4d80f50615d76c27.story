Feyenoord believe Stefan de Vrij is destined for Old Trafford in the coming weeks.

The Dutch side are bracing themselves for a series of departures and 22-year-old centre-back de Vrij looks set to reject the option of Lazio for the chance to join Manchester United once a formal offer is accepted. The price is expected to be £7million with add-ons.

United have registered interest in Daryl Janmaat but that deal has not moved on yet according to Feyenoord.

On his way: Feyenoord believe Stefan de Vrij is destined for Manchester United in the coming weeks

They expect striker Graziano Pelle's move to Southampton to advance today while left-back Terence Kongolo is also wanted by their former coach Ronald Koeman.

Feyenoord coach Fred Rutten said: 'I signed a contract with Feyenoord in the fullest sense. If players leave then you should not moan. Players always leave if a club is successful. I am confident that there will be an adequate response and worthy replacements will return.'

United, meanwhile, are understood to have spoken to Sporting Lisbon about on-off target William Carvalho once again as they try to get the buy-out clause of £37.5m reduced. The player is represented by Jorge Mendes and Chelsea have asked about the 22-year-old also.

Chelsea, however, have yet to make a bid for Borussia Dortmund striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang who the German side will sell for £20m.

Blackpool goalkeeper Matt Gilks could be making the cross-Lancashire switch to Burnley.Manager Sean Dyche is looking for another keeper with Manchester United's Sam Johnstone a possible on loan.

However, Gilks, 32, has Premier League experience and is keen to make the move as Blackpool continue to struggle to put a squad together. Gilks is out of contract but has been offered a new deal and held talks with chairman Karl Oyston and coach Jose Riga last week. Watford have also made an enquiry for the Scotland international as they want competition for Heurelho Gomes.

Blackpool's seven contracted players are unsure when pre-season training is to begin after it was postponed from today to later in the week. Riga has yet to get the coaching staff he wants with former Royal Antwerp coach Bart De Roover his preferred choice as assistant. De Roover held talks on Friday and is weighing up whether to take on the challenge.

The Seasiders are hoping Tom Ince's proposed move to Hull City at gives them a fresh windfall but that will be set at a tribunal and Riga does not know how much of that cash will be re-invested in his squad.

Crunch talks? Michu, linked with Napoli, will meet Swansea manager Garry Monk on Wednesday

Swansea manager Garry Monk will hold talks with midfielder Michu on Wednesday.

The Spaniard is due to report back with the rest of the squad for pre-season training yet it is clear he may not be around for the big kick-off in August.

Napoli are interested in the 28-year-old as are Crystal Palace, Atletico Madrid and Lekhwiya. Napoli have not made an official approach but have taken soundings about his fitness following his ankle surgery and are biding their time before making a bid. They would like to take him on loan with view to a permanent move but Swansea won't countenance that at this stage.

They are awaiting the outcome of Tottenham's talks with left-back Ben Davies before making their next move although Marseille winger Dimitri Payet is on their radar.

Payet has long been linked with Newcastle and Liverpool in the past but Swansea are keen to discuss the finances of a proposed deal and forge a link-up with fellow France international Bafetimbi Gomis. Marseille value Payet at £6.5m but may agree a compromise deal.

Arsenal have a strong interest in Morgan Schneiderlin at Southampton, have enquired about Sami Khedira's figures at Real Madrid and maintain an interest in Maxime Gonalons of Lyon also.

Their interest in Schneiderlin has been one of the worst kept secrets in the game although scouts have also been monitoring Southampton right-back Calum Chambers for months.

Khedira is wanted to varying degrees by all the top Premier League sides and Madrid are keen to trigger an auction.

However, the 25-year-old Gonalons remains an option.

Lyon president Jean Michel Aulas has declared the France international can leave for a 'top ten club' and Napoli have long been considered the favourites. However, the Italian club have been told in their initial negotiations that Arsenal hold a keen interest and wish to be informed if rivals bids are made.

Arsenal were linked with an enquiry for Roma winger Alessandro Florenzi yesterday but reportedly were swiftly told the 23-year-old is not for sale. They have also been offered Jackson Martinez again from Porto following his World Cup performances and, on his showing for Colombia, he wouldn't be a bad investment.

Real Madrid are willing to offer £25million to make Toni Kroos of Bayern Munich their first summer signing. Talks have begun between the clubs for the Germany international who Manchester United passed on last month. Kroos has one year left on contract but Bayern were refusing to sell cheaply.

However, Madrid are prepared to add extra money to push it through this summer rather than allowing him to talk to other clubs in January.

Kroos had agreed to join United under David Moyes but Louis Van Gaal has decided not to pursue a move for the 24-year-old. United remain in the hunt for Madrid target Arturo Vidal of Juventus who has indicated he would prefer Old Trafford if he were to leave.

Juventus are awaiting an offer of around £50m for Paul Pogba from Paris St Germain who are also keen on Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech.

Wigan will listen to offers for former Sunderland winger James McClean. Derby County have been knocked back in an initial approach with Uwe Rosler keen to recoup at least £2million on the Republic of Ireland international.

McClean put any worries over his future to one side at the weekend. The 25-year-old put together a Selext XI for the testimonial of Derry City's Barry Molloy. McClean's side, which included former Wigan boss Owen Coyle, ran out 4-1 winners with McClean stroking home a Coyle cross to put his side 2-1 up. Around £2,000 was raised out of gate receipts from the game and the winger matched that sum out of his own pocket to raise £4,000 for local charity Foyle Hospice.

Hull City are signing Bristol Rovers youngster Alefe Santos. Similarly to Hull's move for Tom Ince, the transfer fee will be decided via a tribunal. The Sao Paulo-born winger, 19, is out of contract at the Memorial Stadium and Hull have been able to agree personal terms but will be required to pay compensation as he is under 23.

West Bromwich Albion are keen on Ipswich Town left-back Aaron Cresswell. Manager Mick McCarthy says he is available 'at the right price' and talks are expected.

The 24-year-old former Tranmere Rovers defender has steadily impressed over recent seasons at Portman Road and has also been discussed at Southampton. Albion will consider Norwich City's Martin Olsson should they struggle to find common ground with Ipswich. Cresswell signed a new three-and-a-half-year contract at Ipswich in December.
