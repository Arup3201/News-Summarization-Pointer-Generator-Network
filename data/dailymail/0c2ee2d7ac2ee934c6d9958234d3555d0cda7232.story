Norwegian wonderkid Martin Odegaard was handed his Real Madrid B competitive debut on Sunday, playing the last 20 minutes in their 2-2 draw with Athletic Bilbao's second string.

Odegaard was wanted by a host of top European clubs including Manchester United and Bayern Munich, before eventually signing for Real, but could not prevent the B-team from dropping two valuable points in their promotion push from Spanish football's third division. 

The result, which came after Castilla had led 2-1, sees them sit second in the table, one point behind league leaders Real Union de Irun.

Prior to Sunday's outing, Odegaard had trained with Real Madrid's first-team and starred in a behind-closed doors friendly with Chinese outfit Beijing Guoan, contributing two assists in a 3-3 thriller.   

Odegaard's bow in a competitive fixture, was not quite as fruitful but still saw plenty of positives. The 16-year-old, on for Alvaro Medran in the 70th minute, did create chances, even if his team-mates were unable to convert them. 

Floating effortlessly between the central and wide positions, there were certainly signs to suggest that the Norwegian could go on to become a very important player for the Real Madrid senior squad in the future. 

For now, though, he will continue his development in the Castilla set-up, under the tutelage of head coach Zinedine Zidane, who himself was a world-class midfielder during his playing days.
