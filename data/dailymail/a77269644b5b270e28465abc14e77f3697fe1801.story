Pride: Catherine Zeta Jones has donated money for the lost palace of Welsh prince Llywelyn the Great

Hollywood star Catherine Zeta Jones has given a boost to efforts to preserve the site of the 'lost palace' of ancient Welsh princes.

Catherine, 43, made a 'substantial' donation to a trust bidding to buy up farmland thought to be the site where the last independent rulers of Wales had their royal residence.

The 700-year-old lost palace of Llywelyn the Great and his grandson Llywelyn the Last is believed to have stood in what is now mostly fields.

And now the Garth Celyn Trust plans to erect a public monument to the Welsh princes at the farmland in Bangor, North Wales.

Trustee Paul Martin Remfry said: 'The home of the Welsh princes of Wales, has been ignored for far too long.

'The trustees are delighted that Catherine Zeta-Jones is taking a personal interest in the work of the trust.

'Her involvement will undoubtedly help to raise the profile of this Welsh project internationally.

He added: 'The historical and 
archaeological evidence is overwhelming and we want to ensure its 
guaranteed preservation for the benefit of present and future 
generations.'

Former Monty Python star Terry Jones is also keen on backing efforts to buy the 29 acres of land from the current owners.

The ancient palace was, according to legend, situated at the place where an mansion called Pen-y-Bryn - dating back to 1624 itself - now stands.

While the stories told locally were sometimes doubted by historians, a number of archaeological digs were carried out over the past few years suggesting that there was indeed a large complex of buildings on the site, including an impressive great hall, supporting the idea that Garth Celyn was indeed the location of a palace.

It seems to have been one of the final strongholds of the independent princes of Wales, as Llywelyn the Last spent time there before his death at the decisive Battle of Orewin Bridge in 1282, which handed control of the country to England's King Edward I.

The mansion's current occupier Kathryn Gibson said: 'The locals have always called the house 
Llewelyn's Tower and it seems this local lore has been handed down over 
the centuries.

'It's great that Catherine Zeta Jones is showing an interest.'

The landscape of Garth Celyn in north Wales is now the site of a Tudor manor house - but in the medieval period, it is believed to have been home to the last independent princes of Wales.

One of the princes to have maintained a palace there was Llywelyn the Great (pictured right on his deathbed in 1240), probably the most powerful ruler in Wales's history, who successfully resisted efforts by King John and Henry III to expand their English kingdom into Wales during the early 13th century.

His grandson, known as Llywelyn the Last, is recorded as sending letters from Garth Celyn, which appears to have been one of the final strongholds of his vanishing lands.

However, Llywelyn was killed at the Battle of Orewin Bridge in 1282, leading to the takeover of Wales by Edward I and its subsequent absorption into the English kingdom.

The conquest of Wales brought an end to the royal connections of Garth Celyn, and historians have since doubted that it was in fact the spot where Llywelyn the Great held court - but recent archaeological digs proved that a great hall once stood on the site, bolstering its claims to palatial status.
