Tricks considered harmful or degrading to dogs are to be banned from competitions after a boom in extreme routines following Pudsey's success on Britain's Got Talent.

The dog and handler Ashleigh Butler’s victory prompted a 20 per cent rise in interest in competitive dog-dancing events.

But the Kennel Club – which governs all such events in the UK – is set to introduce rule changes banning certain techniques, to come into effect next year.

Pudsey impressed viewers by walking on his hind legs - but dogs will now only be allowed to perform this move for ten seconds.

He also jumped on to 17-year-old Ashleigh's shoulders to the Mission Impossible theme tune - a crowd-pleasing move that will also now be forbidden because it could could a strain.

The BGT star's jumps and pirouettes brought a smile to armchair TV fans across the country, but 'extreme' or 'unnatural' positions have been deemed potentially dangerous and liable to cause injury.

The Kennel Club labelled other aspects of some routines - including dressing dogs up - degrading to the animals.

It fears that with the rise in popularity of the pastime, owners will attempt riskier moves.

Kennel Club secretary Caroline Kisko explained: 'We know that the more people we get into the sport, the more they are going to have to look to other types of moves in order to make an impact.'

‘We are trying to pre-empt that. The priority is the dog’s safety.

'We have used Ashleigh and Pudsey as an opportunity to encourage young people to get into it.’

She said the success of Pudsey - a border collie, bichon frise and Chinese crested cross - had been good for encouraging owners to be more active with the dogs, but she wants to ensure they don't go too far.

In future competitions any pair completing a performance considered unnatural, degrading or extreme will be banned.

She added that dogs wearing fancy dress costumes would definitely not be tolerated.

'We are trying to stop what we would see as demeaning for the dog,' she said.

'They are allowed to wear a certain amount - perhaps the equivalent of a dog coat. But we would absolutely not expect the dog to turn up in a full Santa Claus kit, for instance.'

Nationally, there are just under a hundred clubs that offer dog dancing activities.

Britain's Got Talent winner Ashleigh, who became the first dog owner to win the competition when her dog Pudsey scooped first prize, is a member of the Kennel Club.

At club events, dogs perform routines to music in sets of up to four minutes duration.

Most shows feature two categories - heelwork and freestyle. The latter gives owners the opportunity to try out more innovative tricks.

Each discipline is scored on content, accuracy and musical interpretation.

The new rules formally come into effect next year, but the Kennel Club has asked owners to observe the new laws in spirit from now.

Victory leap: However, dogs will still be allowed to perform jumps like this one

Dog owners breaking the new rules face being disqualified.

RSPCA spokeswoman Katy Geary said: 'If anything leads to the animal's discomfort then this should of course be stopped. 

'Learning tricks and obedience (provided it is done in the right way) can be positive for a dog. 

'We think that this is a distraction from the main welfare concerns associated with the improper breeding of pedigree dogs.

'We'd like to see the Kennel Club concentrate its efforts in helping to bring an end to breathing difficulties, epilepsy, spinal problems and other serious health issues associated with pedigree dogs.'
