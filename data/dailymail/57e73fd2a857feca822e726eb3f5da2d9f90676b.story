A school have been forced to apologise after an 'exemplar' slide  which listed Ukip as a racist group alongside Neo Nazis and compared the party's beliefs to Hitler's was shown to hundreds of pupils.

The UK Independence Party was named alongside far-right groups the British National Party and English Defence League as part of a 'thought for the week' session surrounding the Holocaust.

Bridge Learning Campus in Bristol sent out the presentation to all tutor groups within the secondary school, which caters for 660 pupils aged 11 to 16, to form the basis for a discussion.

This comes days after headteacher Keziah Featherstone  was accused of double standards after a pupil was allegedly expelled following a row about his hairstyle - despite having dyed hair herself.

Keziah Featherstone, headteacher of the Bristol school, said the slide which listed Ukip as a racist group alongside Neo Nazis was a 'genuine error' from one individual

The slide, headed The Rise of Racist Groups, said: 'You have the right to believe what you want - but if you have racist ideas and discriminate against a group of people – then you are a racist.'

It was written by one teacher who is currently being investigated and is said to be 'mortified' by the blunder.

The presentation which also claimed parties were trying to 'sound reasonable by hiding their racism' has prompted a furious response among Ukip representatives.

Michael Frost, who is Bristol's first Ukip councillor, representing Hengrove, said: 'At that young age, pupils have got knowledge-thirsty minds and something like this could give them a false impression of a legitimate mainstream party, showing them to be something they are not.

'The teacher has a serious responsibility in the education of our young people. Whether deliberate or naive, this is serious.'

Bridge Learning Campus in Bristol sent out the presentation to all tutor groups within the secondary school, which caters for 660 pupils aged 11 to 16

The slide, shown to pupils on Wednesday, said: 'Some group rise up and spout racist ideas – they want to discriminate against a group of people but want to sound respectable – they want to sound reasonable and hide their racism by trying to give reasons for their anger hate and violence. 

'But listen carefully and you will hear they are not so different from Hitler – and that is what is scary.' 

John Langley, UKIP's Bristol spokesman, said: 'This is outrageous and highly inflammatory given that some students may live in Hengrove where we have an elected councillor who is very much anti-racist. 

'It is a dangerous attempt to defame UKIP as we head towards another election, and leaves Bridge Learning Campus in an untenable position of showing inappropriate political bias contrary to law.' 

He said the teaching material was in breach of the 1996 Education Act, which states that bias should be avoided when teaching political issues.

The matter has been referred to HM Inspectorate of Education and Ofsted. 

Keziah Featherstone, headteacher of the Bristol school, said the slide was a 'genuine error' from one individual who has been at the school for several years.

'It was sent out as part of 'thought for the week' which centered around the Holocaust. It was to be used to form a discussion at tutor time,' she said.

Ms Featherstone hit the headlines earlier this week after expelling a pupil who posted a picture of her with dyed hair on his Facebook timeline with the caption: 'This is not an example to set to other students'

'One teacher usually produces an exemplar slide and it is then sent round to all the form group tutors who can use it to form the basis of a discussion.

'The nature of a school means there is not enough time for everything to be thoroughly checked.

'The teacher in question is currently being investigated. It was a genuine mistake and the teacher is mortified.'  

Ms Featherstone hit the headlines earlier this week after it was reported that a pupil was expelled after posting a picture of her with dyed hair on his Facebook with the caption: 'This is not an example to set to other students'.

Michael Frost, who is Bristol's first Ukip councillor, said: 'Whether deliberate or naive, this is serious'

Jordan Ford, 14, was upset after the headteacher  told him his red Mohawk hair style was unacceptable.

So he  found a picture of Ms Featherstone in which she also appears to have dyed purple hair and posted it on social media - attracting 50 comments which made reference to her looks and weight. 

The school's 'racist groups' presentation has also sparked a furious response on social media.

Marilyn Laurence said: 'I would like to register a complaint that Bridge Learning Campus are teaching pupils that UKIP are racist - please explain.'

Danny Carroll tweeted saying: 'Hope @UKIP will reporting #bridgelearningcampus for slander.'

Mark Davies, chief executive of the school, said: 'The slide was used in a class discussion about community relationships and tolerance, and was designed to stimulate debate among our pupils.

'It was a mistake for UKIP to have been listed along with the other groups, and I have apologised to the party for its inclusion.

'The reference has been removed from the slide and the teacher concerned has apologised and we have taken steps to ensure it will not reappear in future.' 

A school governors' chairman was forced to quit his post after joining Ukip because they political party's policies are 'against it's ethos' in November last year.

Mike Ward claims he was asked to step down from his role as Head of Governors at Eskdale School in Whitby, North Yorkshire after he became a member of Ukip.
