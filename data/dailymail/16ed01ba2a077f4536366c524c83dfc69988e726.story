England international Ravi Bopara says the side needs to 'stop being so English' as they bid to recover from their World Cup horror show.

Peter Moores' men returned home from Australia and New Zealand before the quarter-finals, with questions and critics stacking up.

The team's approach to limited overs cricket has been rubbished by some, while others have suggested the team puts too great an emphasis on data rather than performances.

Bopara was part of England's World Cup squad that failed so spectacularly in Australia and New Zealand

And Bopara, who was part of the squad which failed so miserably Down Under, knows changes are needed.

He told the Daily Telegraph: 'We need to change the culture. We need to change it quickly.

'We need to be a bit more free as players and stop worrying about the consequences and at times stop being so English.

'We are very, very English and it feels quite institutionalised at times. If you look at other countries they are more open about things and more honest about things.'

Bopara says England need to stop being so English and admit they are not good enough after World Cup

Bopara says the English are too worried about what people think of them

The Essex all-rounded cited an incident involving the touring Indian side last summer which he believes backs up his point that England need to get real.

'You had India eating McDonalds on the outfield here last summer (at Headingley) - does it matter? What's wrong with that? They were hungry! They are not worried about how they look - they were hungry they want to eat,' he said.

'For too long we have been worried about what people think of us sometimes that media has influenced the way we do things. We should be honest with everyone - say it straight up.

'We weren't good enough in the World Cup - our skills weren't good enough. Other teams have developed their skills a lot faster than we have because they were honest enough to say it earlier.'
