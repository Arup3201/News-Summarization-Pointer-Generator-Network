A robin had its feathers ripped out and was left for dead after being cruelly caught in a superglue trap.

The little red bellied bird had attempted to wriggle free from the glue board, used to capture rats and rodents but had only succeeded in pulling lumps of its plumage out.

Two boys discovered the robin chirping in distress and it was rescued by RSPCA officers.

The wildlife charity today called for a ban on the glue traps in which extra-strong adhesive is spread onto boards to catch vermin.

It was designed not to dry or lose its stickiness so catches any animal which comes along and can cause them a slow, lingering death, an RSPCA spokesman said.

The bird was found struggling by the side of Park Road in Hornsey, London, by the 12-year-old schoolboys.

Inspector Natalie Bartle said: 'This poor little robin was a pitiful sight when I first arrived - very distressed and sticky all over. Without the caring attitude and diligence of these two young boys who knows how much longer it would have suffered?

'It just shows how cruel and indiscriminate these traps can be. They catch any animal which happens along and this robin was lucky - usually those caught die a long and drawn out death.'

Despite the loss of tail feathers, the robin survived and was taken to a wildlife centre where it was later released back to the wild.

The RSPCA spokesman added it was an offence under the Wildlife and Countryside Act to set these glue boards in a place where wild birds could be caught.

However, it is legal to use them to catch rats and mice but anyone doing so was required to take precautions to avoid death or injury to wild birds or other protected animals.
