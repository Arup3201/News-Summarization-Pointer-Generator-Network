The murder trial of a high school valedictorian begins today after he allegedly bludgeoned and stabbed his mother to death.

Jeffrey Pyne, 22, has been charged with first-degree murder in the death of his mother Ruth whose body was found in the garage of the family's suburban Michigan home.

Mrs Pyne, 51, was found in May 2011 by Jeffrey's ten-year-old sister Julia. She had been stabbed 16 times and her head repeatedly beaten with a board.

Jury selection was under way at Oakland County Circuit this afternoon and could take several days.

Jeffrey Pyne was indicted by a secret grand jury five months after his mother's death in 2011. Although little has been revealed pre-trial, it is believed that the prosecution has mentioned wounds to the 22-year-old's hands, according to ABC.

Pyne, who was in the midst of a promising academic career studying biology at the University of Michigan, maintains his innocence, saying he was working as a handyman for a neighbor at the time of his mother's death. 

His father Bernard Pyne also believes that his son is innocent of the brutal slaying on May 27, 2011. If convicted, Jeffrey Pyne faces life without parole.

The defense has suggested that the brutal murder could have been committed by an intruder although nothing was stolen from the home, according to the Detroit News.

The 22-year-old has been in jail since being arrested in October last year. He was first held in the same Oakland County prison  where his mother spent two weeks in 2010, charged with beating her son and trying to choke him.

Many in the close-knit, rural community of Highland Township knew that the pair had a dysfunctional and volatile relationship.

Mrs Pyne, a dental hygienist, reportedly suffered from psychosis and paranoid schizophrenia and was involuntarily hospitalized.

Court documents stated she needed medication to control her violent tendencies, most of which were targeted towards her son.

His father Bernard, a 
52-year-old automotive engineer, maintains his son is innocent and would
never do anything to hurt his mother.

Court
records show that it was when Jeffrey was only nine that his mother 
started threatening to kill him. Bernard Pyne described his wife as a 
'kind and loving mother' when she had taken her medication.

Defense attorney James Champion of Grand Rapids said Jeffrey Pyne played no role in the death.

'This wasn't a case of some kind of 
struggle or outburst,' Mr Champion said. 'Jeffrey Pyne did not do this. 
This is something Jeffrey Dahmer would do, not Jeffrey Pyne.'

For
five months her murder was unsolved before the case was taken up by 
Oakland County grand jury, convened earlier this year to review dozens 
of unsolved homicides. Prosecutors said testimony ties Jeffrey Pyne to 
his mother's death.

'The grand jury compelled testimony from
the defendant's family, friends and coworkers, which produced evidence 
linking Jeffrey Pyne to the murder,' Oakland County Prosecutor Jessica 
Cooper said in announcing the indictment.

The
Pynes - who were deeply religious - enrolled their son and daughter at 
West Highland Christian Academy where Jeffrey Pyne was described as a 
star student and athlete.

From 1998 onwards, Ruth Pyne's mental 
health deteriorated, and she would threaten to kill herself and her son.
After this she was diagnosed with being both bipolar and a paranoid 
schizophrenic.

Over the
coming years, psychiatrists would describe her as 'angry and violent', 
'severely mentally ill', 'a danger to herself and others' and suffering 
from 'acute mania', court records show.

In
2009, in a petition to the probate court asking that his wife be 
committed to a mental hospital, Bernard Pyne wrote she was refusing 
medication, believed a computer chip had been implanted in her daughter 
and had been 'striking our son for no reason'.

He
had sent their young daughter Julia to stay with relatives. According 
to the Detroit Free Press, Bernard Pyne wrote: 'I must work, and can't 
monitor her when I work. ... She claims that her family could die, and 
it would not bother her at all.'

Her treating psychiatrist wrote on October 
7, 2009: 'She is likely to deteriorate severely 
and become a danger to herself and others due to her refusal to accept 
treatment for her very serious mental illness,' and recommended immediate transport to a mental health hospital 
for involuntary commitment.

She was in and out of hospital and spent time in jail in 2010 after trying to kill her son. The judge released her on $10,000 bond and said she could return home as long as she took her medication in front of her husband.

The trial of Jeffrey Pyne continues.
