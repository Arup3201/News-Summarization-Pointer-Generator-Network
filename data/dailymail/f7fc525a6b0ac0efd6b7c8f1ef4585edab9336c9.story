Timetables and text books have been chucked out for a more free and alternative way of learning which has been credited for a significant improvement in students' confidence, concentration and discipline at a western Sydney high school.

Delany College at Granville, which is in a low socio-economic area with a diverse student population of as many as 38 different nationalities, and some with learning difficulties, collaborated with Telstra at the beginning of the year to introduce the new teaching approach.

Instead of the 68 year seven students being split up into six different classes throughout a six period day - the students share the one open learning space with five teachers across the three 100 minute blocks of learning time each day.

To prepare for their day ahead, the children start off with 'brain push-ups' which includes five minutes of tai chi, martial arts or meditation.

Principal Peter Wade told the ABC that the initiative had 'turned our timetable totally on its head' to allow students and the staff to closely work together.a day.

The staff say they have witnessed pupils growing in their confidence as learners and are more articulate after just eight months into the new initiative which is more about engagement than test scores.

'Every learning experience is about getting the pupils to have an emotional connection to it because if the heart is excited then the mind always remembers,' Year Seven teacher Ivanka Rancic said. 

'We don't have the behaviours most other schools would have in a year seven. So a lot of things have been eliminated through this process.'

This term, the students are focusing on 'how do I find my voice' which involved writing scripts for a chat show as well as being an artist for a day. 

Ms Rancic said she could never have dreamed she would be supportive of such a program.

'Had you told me a year ago that I'd be like this I would have said no and I would have been adamant it would have been a no. But I've grown as a teacher, not only as a teacher but as a person. I've become a better mother,' she said. 

The students are also big fans of the new way to learn with Jamal SwalahMcdahroy, 12, saying he now enjoys attending school and thinking for himself.

'Now the curriculum has changed and you have to find the information yourself and be curious wanting to know what it is,' he said.

'It makes you interested because there's things you have in your normal lives. In other schools you don't really have that so your get bored just looking at normal textbooks.' 

The school plans to roll out the new curriculum to year eight next year and years nine and 10 in 2016.
