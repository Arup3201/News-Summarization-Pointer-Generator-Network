From breathtakingly clear shots of brittle stars and vivid sea sponges, to the intricate, yet delicate skeletons of coral, one photographer has managed to document the beauty of Caribbean reefs in exquisite detail.

Massachusetts-based artist and designer Jessica Rosenkratz took the shots during dives off the coasts of Windsock beach, Bari Reef and Tolo on the island of Bonaire.

She used macro lenses and strobe lights to capture the extremely close-up images and is planning to use them as inspiration in her design studio, Nervous System.

Massachusetts-based artist and designer Jessica Rosenkratz captured the close-up shots, including this star encrusting coral, during dives off the coasts of Windsock beach, Bari Reef and Tolo on the island of Bonaire. Encrusting corals grow on hard rocky surfaces. They grow larger in diameter, rather than height, which is common in many other coral species. This gives them the advantage over other corals in terms of size, yet they are brittle and can break in storm conditions

Nervous System was set up in 2007 by 
creative director Rosenkrantz and fellow MIT graduate Jesse 
Louis-Rosenberg, who is chief science officer.

It specialises in creating jewellery, homeware, lighting and puzzles inspired by patterns found in nature.

Among her Bonaire photos, Rosenkratz captured images of the Callyspongia plicifera, also known as the Azure Vase Sponge.

It is shaped like a vase, with grooves 
and pits on the outside, and grows to approximately 18 inches tall. It 
is found in coral reefs in the Caribbean, Bahamas, and Florida. It is one of the most colourful sponges found in corals around the world ranging from pink to purple to fluorescent light blue.

During the dive, Rosenkrantz also managed to take macro photos of maze coral, known as the Platygyra Brain Worm Coral.

Platygyra comes from the Greek word platys, meaning flat, and gyros, which means wide circle. This describes the maze-like channels of its skeleton. Large maze corals can grow up to 7-inches wide.

One of the most hardy corals photographed during Rosenkratz's trip was the zoanthid, pictured, a type of so-called colonial coral. Colonies of coral consist of separate polyps that can live together and each contribute to the area¿s ecosystem. Zoanthids are photosynthetic yet can live in very low light levels and may occasionally eat brine shrip, for example.The Palythoa zoanthid produces Polytoxin that can be deadly

The majority of corals found in the Caribbean and Bahamas are known colloquially as reef builders. They secrete calcium carbonate which hardens to form a coral skeleton, like the one pictured

Among her Bonaire photos, Rosenkratz captured images of the Callyspongia plicifera, also known as the Azure Vase Sponge, pictured left. The sponge is shaped like a vase, with grooves and pits on the outside, and grows to approximately 18 inches tall. During another dive, Rosenkratz caught Basket sea stars, pictured right, floating through the water. These stars have been known to live for up to 35 years and are distinguishable by their branched arms and complex structures

There are in excess of 30 different variations of zoanthid and palythoa polyps. The individual golden zoanthids, also captured by Rosenkratz, are approximately 0.25-inches wide. They are found in the Carribbean and the Bahamas, predominately in shallow waters.

The golden zaonthid grows symbiotically on several species of sponge in small groups and rows on the surface of their host. They resemble small sea anemones and get their name from their orange and yellow colouring.

During another dive, Rosenkratz caught Basket sea stars floating through the water.

These stars have been known to live for up to 35 years and are distinguishable by their branched arms and complex structures.

They are part of a group known as brittle stars closely related to starfish and found in deep waters. 

The average basket weighs almost a stone (11lb) and doesn't contain any blood. Instead they use their water vascular system to convert gases into energy.

Elsewhere, Rosenkratz found star encrusting corals. Encrusting corals grow on hard rocky surfaces.

They grow larger in diameter, rather than height, which is most common in many other coral species. This gives them the advantage over other corals in terms of size, yet they are brittle and can break in storm conditions.

Rosenkrantz graduated from MIT in 2005 with degrees in Architecture and Biology.

'We are attracted to complex and unconventional geometries. Our inspirations are grounded in the natural forms and corresponding processes which construct the world around us,’ Rosenkratz said. 

‘From coral aggregations to interference patterns, a study of natural phenomena is an essential ingredient to our design process.

‘We created Nervous System to explore a design approach that relates process and form in a context of interactivity and openness.’

The company writes computer programs, based on patterns found in nature, and uses these programs to create art, jewellery, household items, lights and puzzles.

These include earrings shaped like dendrites, similar to those found in neurons, lamps inspired by the veins of leaves, and an amoeba jigsaw.
