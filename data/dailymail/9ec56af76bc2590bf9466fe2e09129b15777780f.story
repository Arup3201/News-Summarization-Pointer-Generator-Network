Should West Ham sack manager Sam Allardyce?

Is there really any point in a second leg? Such was the emphatic manner of Manchester City’s win in the Capital One Cup semi-final first leg here last night, they did not even need a second half.

Three goals up by the interval and coasting towards the final, Manuel Pellegrini’s side were every bit as dominant as West Ham had feared. The trip to Upton Park in two weeks is nothing more than a  formality, as is their place at Wembley on March 2.

Alvaro Negredo must take the plaudits for a well-taken hat-trick with his left foot but rarely can the Spaniard have had an easier night.

At times, West Ham’s defending was 
amateurish. City do not need any help scoring goals — especially at the 
Etihad where they now have 59 in 15 games this season — and there could 
have been far more  on a night when they fired 32 shots at goal.

Edin
 Dzeko scored another two and the Bosnian had lost count of City’s 
tally by the time he was interviewed afterwards, mistakenly thinking it 
was five.

‘That happens 
sometimes,’ said Pellegrini with a knowing smile after his Champions 
League  miscalculation in Munich last month. As it rained goals on a wet
 night in Manchester, Sam Allardyce stood under heavy skies while the 
West Ham fans called for his head.

In the stands, co-owner David Sullivan, who gave his manager a vote of support this week, look equally
 unimpressed.

Allardyce was 
axed by Blackburn shortly after a 7-1 defeat across town at Manchester 
United in 2010, and on the sixth anniversary of his sacking by Newcastle
 he must have left fearing the chop again.

Tickets for the second leg - now a mere formality - were on sale to West Ham fans for £42. You Unhappy Hammers are probably best off saving the cash...

Pellegrini,
 on the other hand, remains on course for his first trophy in English 
football and it will not be the only silverware in City’s sights. Even 
the cautious Chilean struggled to say there was still any life left in 
this tie afterwards.

‘In football it’s never finished,’ he said. ‘But it’s an important step to playing in the final at Wembley.’

The
 writing was on the wall even before kick-off. West Ham arrived on a run
 of one win in nine games and fresh from a 5-0 FA Cup pummelling by 
Championship side Nottingham Forest on Sunday.

In February 1990, West Ham lost 6-0 at Oldham Athletic in a League Cup semi-final first leg. It proved to be manager Lou Macari’s final game in charge…

Allardyce
 made eight changes from that game, giving a debut to centre back Roger 
Johnson, signed on loan from Wolves. It is no secret Allardyce would 
have preferred City’s Joleon Lescott but that deal is on hold.

It
 always felt like a case of how long the Hammers could hold out, and the
 answer was just 12 minutes. For all City’s artistry, the goal was a 
route one creation straight out of Allardyce’s box of tricks.

Yaya
 Toure launched a high ball from halfway between Johnson and George 
McCartney, who had lost track of Negredo. The Spaniard had time to let 
the ball drop over his shoulder before executing an exquisite left-foot volley inside the near post. 

Toure
 was left writhing in pain after a tangle with Mohamed Diame but 
continued after treatment. He had just limped back on when City scored 
their second goal in the 26th minute.

Negredo
 played the ball around the corner to Dzeko and broke upfield with 
McCartney struggling to keep up. Dzeko’s return pass sent his team-mate 
through and Negredo slid in to steer an emphatic finish beyond Adrian.

Alvaro Negredo tweeted this picture of his signed hat-trick ball with the message: 'Good performance of the teammates. I'm very happy with my 3 goals too! Here is the ball of the match.'

Toure
 scored City’s third five minutes before half-time after more shocking 
defending by West Ham as he broke from halfway. Johnson went into 
reverse while Guy Demel and Mark Noble gave chase, but nobody got a 
challenge in before the City player drilled the ball home from 10 yards.

Half-time
 brought no respite for the visitors as City extended their lead within 
four minutes. David Silva’s cross deflected to Negredo, who made no 
mistake with another assured finish with his left foot.

It
 was left to Dzeko to grab the last two goals, the first when Silva 
picked out overlapping Gael Clichy, whose low cross was turned in at the
 near post by the Serb.

Then Nasri’s clever backheel let substitute Aleksandar Kolarov cross for Dzeko to crack in an emphatic sixth.

The
 West Ham fans turned on Allardyce, who stood impassively on the 
touchline as the rain came down. Whether he will still be there when 
City go to Upton Park later this month remains to be seen.
