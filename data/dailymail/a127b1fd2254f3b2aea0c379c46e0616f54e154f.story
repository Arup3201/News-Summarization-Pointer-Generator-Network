Arsene Wenger will subject his players to a video nasty of their 3-1 Champions League home defeat by Monaco after admitting it was painful to watch what has been described as one of Arsenal’s worst performances in his 17 years at the club.

With Gary Lineker leading the criticism, calling the display ‘beyond amateurish’, Wenger says he will go over the basic defensive errors with the team, with Arsenal caught three times on the break.

On Sunday, Wenger’s team take on Everton, fresh from their Europa League triumph on Thursday, and though Arsenal have won five out of the last six Premier League games, the team will have to win over a potentially mutinous Emirates Stadium.

Wenger conceded that reviewing the Monaco game was difficult given the number of basic errors his team had made. ‘I haven’t shown the tape to the players yet,’ he said. ‘I have watched it myself. It is always hard. It is hard to see that you make mistakes.’

Wenger insisted he would maintain his focus, dismissing Lineker’s analysis as over the top. ‘The comments are always extreme, he said. ‘I let people talk and I don’t talk too much. What is important is to give a strong response.

‘I love to win and when I don’t win I’m hurt. But the defeat hurts more than the criticism.’

In a further blow, Wenger revealed that Jack Wilshere has had fresh surgery to relieve some irritation on his injured ankle, so he will be out for at least two weeks.

Arsene Wenger admitted it had been painful watching the game again due to the number of mistakes 

Wilshere returned to the bench last weekend after missing three months with damaged ankle ligaments. But to support the ligaments, doctors inserted small pins in his ankle area — and these have now been removed as they were hampering his progress.

Wenger added: ‘The match on Sunday is a different competition and it is important we continue our run in the Premier League.’

Striker Olivier Giroud will be under pressure after a series of misses. But Wenger does not expect Giroud to dwell on them.

‘I hope not,’ said Wenger. ‘He’s a strong character, Olivier. We lost as a team. We fight for each other as a team.’
