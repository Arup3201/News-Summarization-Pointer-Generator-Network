New life: Charles Pontiero is saving up for a sex change and has changed her name by deed poll to Alessia

A former military sniper has quit the U.S. army and moved to Britain where she lives as a woman with her lesbian lover.

Former-squaddie Charles Pontiero, 40, is saving up for sex-change surgery after settling down in Coventry, West Midlands, with girlfriend Maria.

After meeting student Maria, 29, online, Charles changed her name by deed poll to Alessia - and swapped a life in the army for a job as an actress.

The blonde claims that she's finally decided to make the change and live openly as a woman in the UK because it's easier to change sex in Britain than the U.S.

Alessia, who has married three times and has two teenage children, said: 'I always felt more like a girl than a boy, but I felt like I had to hide my female side when I was in the army.

'I didn't feel like I was really being myself.

'My family have a military background, so it felt like it was always the thing that I was going to do - but it wasn't right for me.

'My family have always known that I feel more woman than man, so there were no surprises when I told them that I wanted to live as a woman.

'They are all very supportive of me - and I'm finally happy now I've changed my name and found Maria.

'I've always wanted to change my name, but it was only when I moved to Britain that I realised how easy it is to change your name here - so I just decided to do it.

'That gave me the confidence to live as Alessia openly.

'I'm taking acting lessons now, so I hope to build a career as an actress.'

Alessia, who was born in South Dakota, served for more than 15 years in the US army as a weapons and explosives specialist in the Balkans, Middle East and Somalia.

Despite being a former sniper for the U.S. army, Alessia said she knows she was always meant to be a woman

The former tough guy admits that since living as a blonde pre-op transsexual, he has been ridiculed and even attacked in the street by people.

But Alessia insists that she has always known she was meant to be a woman - and even claims to have had too much oestrogen in her body as a child.

She said: 'I have always had a lot of oestrogen in my body, so I've always felt very feminine.

'My hormones are so imbalanced that I don't actually need to take hormone replacement drugs as part of my gender change, my body just produces them naturally.

'I had to disguise who I was when I was in the army. I was a good soldier though.

'I'm just glad to be finally living the life that I was supposed to.
