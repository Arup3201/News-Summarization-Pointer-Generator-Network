Murdered: The body of Rosemary Broadwell was discovered  six months after she went missing near her home in Alicante

A British pensioner has been arrested in Spain on suspicion of murdering his expat partner after her decomposing body was found.  

Charlie Bevill-Warcup, 75, was arrested after Rosemary Broadwell's body was discovered on rubbish-strewn waste ground six months after she went missing.

The pensioner was arrested by detectives from the paramilitary Civil Guard.

He was interviewed by police soon after mum-of-two Rosemary, 76, from Hull, vanished on September 15 last year from her home in Algorfa, a small mountain village near the holiday resort of Alicante.

Police suspected from the start that Rosemary's disappearance had not been voluntary after neighbours told them they had heard a row the night before she was reported missing.

Authorities searched mountains, lakes and dirt tracks over a vast area in the search for her.

Bevill-Warcup had previously told detectives he had dropped her off outside a bank so she could withdraw money - but staff at the bank told police she had never entered the branch.

Rosemary's daughter Cheryl Webster, who is currently out in Spain, said today: 'I'm obviously devastated.

'I've been travelling out to Spain every six weeks since my mum disappeared.

'I wasn't expecting this on this visit. I got a call from the police last night to say that a man had been arrested and another call this morning to say my mum's body had been found.

'I haven't had confirmation my mum's partner is the one in custody but I've never liked him.

'My mum was living part-time with him but she was preparing to move out and spend more time at her own place and I had been helping her with the move.'  

Mrs Broadwell, who was just 4ft 8 inches tall, was well-known in the small town, where she had lived for around ten years. 

Police are understood to have identified her by a tattoo of a lizard on her foot and another of a dolphin on her right shoulder. 

A spokesman for the Civil Guard in Alicante said: 'I can confirm the body of a woman thought to be he British expat who went missing last September has been discovered.' 

Police said they would have to wait for the results of an autopsy to establish the cause of death.

In an emotional Facebook post made last month, Rosemary's granddaughter Liza Webster said: 'I don't even know what to say anymore.

'It's been five months and still nothing on the disappearance of my grandma. I miss her terribly and not knowing is cruel.

'Someone somewhere must know something and it's defies all that I've been taught and known, to be so cruel.

'She's my Grandma, a rock and my ally. She really is missed by all.'
