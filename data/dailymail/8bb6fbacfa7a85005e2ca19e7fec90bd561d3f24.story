Global footwear brand Nine West launched their new advertising campaign (pictured) across social media on Friday

Global footwear brand Nine West has been slammed on social media, alongside threats from customers promising to boycott the brand, for their newly launched advertising campaign which has been dubbed misogynistic.

The retailer, which has had a large number of stores across Australia since 1995, launched its Starter Husband Hunting campaign on social media last Friday, directed at women between the ages of 25 and 49.

The images, posted on Nine West's Facebook and Twitter accounts, shows a leopard print high-heel on a target with an arrow struck through it, alongside the words: 'It's hunting season. Whether you're looking for Mr. Right or Mr. Right Now, we have a shoe for that'.

Facebook and Twitter both exploded upon the company sharing the images, with many claiming that the advertisement belonged back in the 1950s.

'Stupid campaign 9W. Love your shoes but don't patronize your customers by an outdated ideal. Women are hunting success and goals, dreams and visions. Not husbands,' Julie Bohacek wrote on Facebook.

Carey Shoufler responded on Twitter with the following post: 'Cannot believe this campaign. What if I'm a lesbian or don't want a man? Can I wear your shoes? Come on over to the 21st century.'

'I definitely don't need or want 'husband-hunting' shoes. In fact, after this ad I don't need ANY Nine West shoes,' Hillary Kelly wrote on Twitter.

Nine West also revealed their further marketing plans for a range of other 'occasions' to the New York Times.

One such 'event' was the 'anticipatory walk of shame', which the brand designed a leopard print bag for.

Another event requiring beautiful shoes: Critics of the adds questioned  why there were no shoes for powerful working women rather than one who now 'had the weeks off'

Another is the 'First Day of Kindergarten', in which the ad features a woman wearing a pair of black pumps, surrounded by tissues.

The accompanying text reads: 'The bus arrives and so do the waterworks. Then it hits you: mommy now has the weeks off. Wipe those happy-sad tears... We got a shoe for that.'

The campaign hasn't proven to be a failure with everyone however, with one woman commenting on Nine West's social media post with:' Nailed it! Wish I had these for the prowl this weekend'.
