Tottenham teenager Keanan Bennetts is in the unique position of playing for England AND Germany. And even Nigeria have tried to convince the 15-year-old to join them, too.

Bennetts qualifies for all three nations through his German mother, Nicole, Nigerian father, Richard, and being born in Edgware, London.

The exciting winger – known for his blistering pace and technique – has been turning heads with his performances for Tottenham's youth sides, which have prompted a three-way tug of war for his services.

England called up 15-year-old Bennetts after he was offered a trial with Germany

The German national team first called him for a trial earlier this year. They had spotted Bennetts playing for Spurs in youth tournaments in Germany and, when they learned of his eligibility, emailed the family to see if he was interested in a trial.

Of 130 kids, Bennetts – who speaks fluent German – made it down to the final 18 and has since played in friendlies, including against Holland, for their Under 16 side. He has joined up for training camps three times.

Soon after, England began to show interest in the player, keen not to be out-manoeuvred by their bitter rivals, and he has featured in their recent Victory Shield matches against Wales and Northern Ireland.

'As soon as Germany came in for him England invited him to play for them,' his father Richard told Sportsmail. 'He's the only kid to play for Germany at that level and not be at a German club.

'It's tough playing for both teams but very exciting. Keanan has a strong German background from his grandparents, he's been visiting there three times a year since he was born.

'With England he probably feels slightly more settled as he has some of his Spurs team-mates in the team as well.'

Bennetts' performances for Tottenham's Under 16s and Under 17s have been attracting attention. Last month he starred in an Under 17 tournament, held at Arsenal's Hale End academy, which Spurs won. It included Real Madrid, Juventus and Arsenal.

The young winger is a fluent German speaker and is also eligible to play for Nigeria through his father

Nigeria were next to come calling, with their national team manager Stephen Keshi ringing Richard to see if Bennetts would represent them.

At present, Keanan's father considers Nigeria and the distances his son would have to travel as too big a commitment, but they have not ruled out representing them in the future. Richard remains in touch with Keshi.

Under FIFA rules, until he wins a senior cap, he will be able to play for any nation he is eligible for.

'He doesn't have to make a final decision now,' Richard added. 'There will be no rushing. We don't want to shut any doors. He can mix and match. He'll keep playing as much as possible until he gets the feel of who values him the most.'
