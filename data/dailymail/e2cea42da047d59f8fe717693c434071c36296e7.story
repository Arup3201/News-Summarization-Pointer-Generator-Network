The sight of a Cabinet minister deep in discussion with police about the opening of the gates of Downing Street could cause panic at the highest levels of government.

But far from a repeat of the Plebgate row which cost Andrew Mitchell his job, Michael Gove – dubbed the ‘politest man in politics’ – is understood to have had a perfectly pleasant conversation with the officers.

The Education Secretary emerged from Number 10 to find his car had been locked out by the closure of the gates, which Mr Mitchell famously demanded be opened so he could ride his bicycle through them.

Questions: Education Secretary Michael Gove was seen asking armed police why his car could not pick him up in Downing Street

Aides stressed that Mr Gove is one of the politest men in politics and did not have a cross word to say about the officers

Mr Gove had been Number 10 helping David Cameron to prepare for Prime Minister’s Questions.

But Mr Cameron left before him, and any movement involving the Prime Minister leads to Downing Street being placed into a security lockdown.

It meant that Mr Gove’s ministerial car could not meet him at the door to Number 10, so the Tory  minister walked down to speak to police to find out what was going on.

Despite the animated expression in some of the photographs, aides insist it was an amicable conversation.

‘He is the politest man in politics. Any suggestion of cross words could not be further from the truth,' said a source.

On foot: The Education Secretary had expected to find his car waiting for him after prepping David Cameron for Prime Minister's Questions

Andrew Mitchell resigned as Chief Whip for swearing in Downing Street when police would not let him ride his bike through the Downing Street gates

If only Mr Mitchell had taken the same approach. One evening in September 2011 he tried to ride his bike through the main gates, but was told by officers to dismount and use a side gate.

He admits losing his temper and swearing, saying: ‘I thought you guys were supposed to f***ing help us’.

The foul-mouthed outburst eventually cost him his Cabinet job as Chief Whip.

However, he denies a claim made in an official police log that he called the officers ‘f***ing plebs’ – a dispute which has led to legal and disciplinary action being taken against some of the officers involved.
