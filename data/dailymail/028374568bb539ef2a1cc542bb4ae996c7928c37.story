Wigan's England forward Liam Farrell is facing the threat of suspension after being charged with a lifting offence during the Warriors' 36-28 First Utility Super League defeat at Wakefield on Sunday.

Farrell has been charged over a tackle on Wildcats forward Taulima Tautai, who will be a Wigan team-mate from 2015.

He is accused of a grade B offence which carries a ban of one or two matches.

Farrell's current team-mate Anthony Gelling has been charged with a minor grade A offence of punching during Sunday's match.

Bradford captain and caretaker coach Matt Diskin, who is still waiting to discover if he will remain in temporary charge of the Bulls for Sunday's trip to Warrington, is facing a grade A charge of striking, along with Hull KR forward Neville Costigan, during last Friday's home defeat by the Robins.

All four players were charged by the Rugby Football League's match-review panel; who issued cautions to Matt Ryan (Wakefield) and James Greenwood (London Broncos), and have until 11am on Tuesday to submit early-guilty pleas and avoid a disciplinary hearing.
