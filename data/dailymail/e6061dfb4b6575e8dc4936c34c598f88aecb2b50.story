A group of masked clowns attacked a young man's face with cavity filler during a terrifying Halloween prank.

Michael Day feared he would lose his sight after the reckless pranksters sprayed the quick-drying filler over his face as he was walking home from a party in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, on Saturday.

The 21-year-old initially thought he had been struck was shaving foam but began to panic when it began to solidify around his face, fusing his eyes together.  

Michael Day was sprayed with cavity filler by a group of masked clowns during a terrifying Halloween attack in Southend-on-Sea, Essex

The 21-year-old initially thought he had been struck was shaving foam but began to panic when it began to solidify around his face, fusing his eyes together

He said: 'They came at me from behind and even though they had masks I get the feeling they were younger than me.

'I think it was meant to be a prank and they did not realise that cavity filler solidifies. It was a stupid thing to do. I could have lost my sight.'

After the attack, Mr Day had to shave off all his hair because hospital staff said there was no other way of removing the hardened foam.

He added: 'At first I just thought they had sprayed shaving foam on me.

'It was when I got back to my mum's house and it would not come off that I realised what had happened.

'My clothes are ruined and I have had to shave all my hair off. On Sunday I went to the hospital to see if they could help get it off my skin, but they said there was nothing they could give me.'

The young man, who feared he would lose his sight as it began to solidify around his eyes, had to shave off his hair because the filler could not be removed

His mother Lyn Day is urging witnesses to come forward so she can track down her son's attackers.

She said: 'When he arrived he was covered in the cavity filler. It was all over his clothes and hair.

'As we tried to get the foam off it was taking parts of his skin with it and it looked as though the chemicals were burning his skin.

'I just want to warn people that this has been going on.'

Anyone with information about the incident should call Southend police on 101.
