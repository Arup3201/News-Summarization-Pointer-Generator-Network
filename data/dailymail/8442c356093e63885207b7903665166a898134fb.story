Hundreds of people were evacuated from the Shard today following fears of a fire in the basement.

Workers were moved out of Britain's tallest building this morning as firefighters investigated smoke coming from the basement of the 87-storey skyscraper.

Firemen were seen lifting manhole covers in the streets surrounding the building as they searched for the cause of the smoke.

It took three hours for fire chiefs to be satisfied there was no danger posed by the fumes and the safety cordon came down shortly before 2pm.

London Fire Brigade (LFB) confirmed it was investigating reports of smoke in the basement of the building, but said there was no suggestion of a fire

This afternoon fire investigators 
were probing an substation at the tower to make sure the scare was not 
sparked by an electrical fault.

Staff from UK Power Networks arrived shortly after 1.30pm to let officers access the power supply.Spokesman
 John Lang confirmed technicians were on site and said: 'We have a 
substation there, our engineers need to unlock it to let the fire 
brigade in.

'We have heard no reports so far that the source of the 
smoke came from there, but the investigators need to check everywhere in
 the building.

'There is no suggestion at this time that it is an actual fire but the building has been evacuated as a caution.

'No injuries have been reported.'

One of the Qatari owners of the Shard was reported evacuated from Europe's tallest skyscraper this morning after fire broke out in its basement, it was claimed.

According to sources at the scene a high-ranking member of the Qatari family who owns the 1,004 feet tall building was in a meeting when the alarms sounded.

It is not known if Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani was present.

And it has turned intp a PR nightmare for the Â£3,250-a-night hotel based inside.

Wealthy guests arriving at the newly opened five star Shangri-La hotel were left fuming after they were told to wait on the chilly plaza outside with no staff on hand to help.

A spokesman for the building denied any member of the Qatari Royal family were in the building at the time and had to be evacuated along with over 900 people after the fire brigade was called just after 10.30am this morning.

Firefighters from Soho, Dockhead, Old Kent Road, Shoreditch, Whitechapel and Lambeth fire stations are at the scene

Scotland Yard said no arrests had been made and inquiries on the cause of fire were ongoing

A man who did not want to be named said: 'The big man from Qatar was in the building having a meeting and they've just been evacuated.

'Apparently the basement was full of smoke and it was getting worse and worse.

'My friend works for the company and they were all in there for business.

'He had got us tickets to go up to the top, but we didn't get inside.

'We had just got off the train at London Bridge and we were marshalled out of the area and down St Thomas Street.

A fire brigade spokesman said: 'We are investigating the source of smoke coming from the basement'

'The area was full of firemen, we must have seen at least 50 and dozens of engines.'

Firefighters from Soho, Dockhead, Old Kent Road, Shoreditch, Whitechapel and Lambeth fire stations are at the scene.

He said the presence of seven fire engines and around 50 firefighters was usual for that type of building.

Scotland Yard said no arrests had been made and inquiries on the cause of fire were ongoing.

The Shard, Europe's tallest skyscraper at 306 metres (1,004 feet), was built by Qatar's royal family.

It was completed in 2012.
