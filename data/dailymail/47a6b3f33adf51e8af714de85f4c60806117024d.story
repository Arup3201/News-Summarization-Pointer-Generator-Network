A gang of armed robbers held a knife to a child's throat and cut gold bangles from the youngster's mother.

The three men forced their way into a family home in Levenshulme, Greater Manchester on Friday evening and threatened the child before using pliers to cut six bangles from the woman's arm.

Detectives said that the men were then disturbed by a noise and ran away from the address.

The robbery has left the family afraid to live in their own home.

Detective Constable Gareth Croll, from North Manchester CID, said: 'This was a shocking robbery that left the victims terrified and no longer feeling safe in their own home.

'I find it hard to believe that these men did not think twice about threatening a defenceless child to get what they wanted.

'Thankfully no-one was hurt but it has left mental scars.

'I would firstly urge anyone who may have seen these men in or around the area to contact us.

'They clearly have no morals and need to be caught as soon as possible.

'If you have any information that may help us bring these men to justice, we would like to hear from you.

'Secondly, if you or if you know anyone who may have been approached and offered these bangles or any jewellery under suspicious circumstances, please phone police.'

Anyone with information should phone police on 0161 856 3020 or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
