For the fourth time since he began his month-long, New York City street-art project, enigmatic graffiti artist Banksy's work has been struck by vandals.

The latest pieces hit are a stencil on the side of a building in Woodside, Queens, and a car that was part of an installation on Ludlow Street on the Lower East Side.

The Ludlow Street piece includes an actual car parked in front of a wall covered in horses wearing what appear to be night-vision goggles.

Turf: A graffiti artist called 'Problem Child' says this Banksy piece was done on 'his territory' 

The installation first appeared five days ago, with the vehicle completely in-tact. As of Monday afternoon, the doors and gas cap had been removed from the car.

The piece in Queens was damaged about 9 p.m. Monday, just 13 hours after it had gone up. A fellow tagger who calls himself 'Problem Child' is reportedly responsible for defacing Banksy's piece.

'He kept saying about how this was his area. And the guy was pissed,' Kevin Mazeski, who witnessed 'Problem Child' defacing the piece told Gothamist.

Rat: The vandal who tagged this Banksy piece left the message, 'We don't need no more rats!'

On Friday, a beaver stenciled on a wall in Brooklyn by the elusive artist also was damaged.

The piece, which depicted a beaver leaning up against a railing, was covered with spray paint that read 'we don't need no more rats!' in red capital letters.

The beaver's face also had been chipped off.

The vandalism was signed 'Math,' likely the name of another graffiti artist.

Earlier this month, rival graffiti artist 'Omar NYC' spray-painted over a Banksy piece in Red Hook, Brooklyn.

Banksy's work getting vandalized is no surprise; other graffiti artists - often jealous of his notoriety - will deface his work, many in misguided attempt to make a name for themselves.

Better Out Than In: Banksy's New York City artists 'residency' is scheduled to last until the end of October

Additionally, his work is very valuable, with some of his pieces fetching hundreds of thousands of dollars. Even small bits of larger projects - like a car door, for example - could be worth thousands of dollars on the Internet.

On Sunday, the artist sold original works - many worth thousands of dollars - at a tent next to Central Park. He sold the pieces for $60, as most passersby didn't recognize the art as valuable, or believe they were authentic Banksy pieces.

In total, Banksy sold eight paintings on Sunday, for a total of $420.

Banksy's month-long, New York City 'residency' - entitled 'Better Out Than In' - is expected to continue until the end of October.
