A New York court ordered the maker of Monster Energy drink to pay $1.7 million to the Beastie Boys for copyright infringement although the company claimed they owe no more than $125,000.

Attorneys for Adam 'Ad-Rock' Horovitz and Michael 'Mike D' Diamond of the Beastie Boys asked the court to order the company to pay nearly $2.5 million in legal fees to cover their costs in the copyright violation case that began in August 2012.

In June 2014, a Manhattan federal court jury awarded the rappers $1.7 million in damages.

The group first sought the $2.5 million in 2012 for false endorsement and copyright infringement after California-based Monster Energy Co. allegedly used part of several of the group's songs in a promotional video on Monster's website, Rolling Stone reports. 

The group also posted a 23-minute medley of the group's songs on the site and made it available for download.  

The company admitted wrongly using the group's songs in the video that was online for five weeks, but holds that an employee thought the company had permission to use the songs, according to Rolling Stone.

The songs were reportedly taken from a live set done by DJ Z-Trip, an American disk jockey and producer, at a Monster-sponsored festival in Canada.

When the Monster employee sent a draft of a video using the footage to the DJ asking if he approved, the DJ replied 'Dope!' 

This allegedly led the employee to believe the DJ was approving Monster's use of the footage. 

However, in the June 2014 ruling of the judge in the Beastie Boys' favor, it was said that the word 'dope' was not the same as consent to use the footage.

Also, the judge held that the DJ had no authority to grant such permission, Rolling Stone reports.

The beverage maker said initially at the trial that it should owe no more than $125,000 and planned to file an appeal, but a judge decided that the $1.7 million would remain intact, Reuters reports.

The judge ruled that the company's use of the group's songs could lead people to believe they endorsed the energy drinks.

An attorney for Monster told Rolling Stone that though the company respects the jury's decision 'we strongly disagree with it.' 

The suit claimed that Monster included parts of 'Sabotage,' 'So What'cha Want,' Make Some Noise' and 'Looking Down the Barrel of a Gun' in the promotional video.

The suit was filed just months after Adam 'MCA' Yauch, one of the group's members, died from cancer in May of 2012. Yauch's will prohibits any company from using the group's music for advertisements, Rolling Stone reports. 

The Beastie Boys were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012. They have produced four No. 1 albums.
