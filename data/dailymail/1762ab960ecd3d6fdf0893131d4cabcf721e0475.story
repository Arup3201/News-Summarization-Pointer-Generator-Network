Bride-to-be Kirsty Thomas spotted the wedding dress of her dreams and knew she had to have it.

There was just one problem - she needed to lose 5st to fit into the A-line dress. 

Kirsty  weighed 15st 4lb and was a size 16 when she spotted the dress but discovered it was only made in a size 8.

Kirsty, pictured before her weight loss, says she has also gained weight easily

Determined Kirsty bought the dress anyway - and amazingly managed to lose all the weight ahead of her big day.

Kirsty, 25, said: 'When I saw the dress, I just knew that I had to have it.

'The fact that it was only available in a size 8 was just the incentive I needed to really transform my life and get back into shape. 

'I wanted a wedding album that I could be proud of and I knew the only way I was going to be able to achieve my goal was to fit into that dress.' 

Kirsty, from Maesteg, Bridgend, said: 'I had always put on a weight quite easily and needed to be careful what I ate.

Kirsty was so overweight she found it difficult at times to keep balance and kept falling

'I am the type of person who can easily put on 4lb over the course of a weekend if eating lots of fattening things and having ice cream for dessert. 

'I noticed my weight creeping up and obviously that affected my general self-esteem. 

'I put on a lot of weight after the birth of my eldest son. You are told when you are pregnant that you can eat for two, but that is a complete myth. 

'You only need a few more calories in the very late stages of the pregnancy but otherwise you should just eat as you would normally. 

'I put on a stone and a half throughout the pregnancy and I didn't lose it after my son was born.' 

She was so overweight she found it difficult at times to keep balance and kept falling. Her doctor said the falls were because of her weight. 

Kirsty's final trigger which encouraged to knuckle down and diet was a holiday in the Dominican Republic

Switching to a healthier low-fat diet, cutting out the snacking and beginning to exercise saw the pounds fall off

The final trigger which encouraged her to knuckle down and diet was a holiday in the Dominican Republic.

Kirsty said: 'I remember walking down the beach and being approached by a group of women who were all in great shape and looked amazing in their bikinis.

'I felt so self-conscious because I was so badly out of shape and could see they were looking at me. I knew I had to change.' 

Mother-of-two Kirsty had bought the dress last August and when she finally tied the knot in May this year - just nine months later - she was a shapely size 8 weighing just 9st 12lb.

She had lost a staggering 76lb, or 5st 4lb, - more than half a stone a month - and got the body she had always wanted. 

Kirsty achieved this feat by completely changing her diet and exercising regularly.

She had previously snacked throughout the day and was incapable of just having one of her favourite Jaffa Cakes - on a bad day, she could munch her way through a whole packet. 

Kirsty was able to fit into her dream dress just nine months after buying it four sizes too small 

Her other downfall was bread - she would eat five or six slices alongside her evening meal.

Kirsty switched to a healthier low-fat diet, cut out the snacking and started eating low-calorie bread. 

She also started taking Forza Supplements Raspberry K2 capsules which she says helped take the edge off her appetite at weak moments and gave her extra energy to exercise more. 

And if she ever needed an extra incentive to carry on with the diet, she just looked at the white dress in the cupboard and dreamed of the day she would be able to fit into it.

Kirsty said she felt like a new woman as she got back into shape. She said: 'Once I put my mind to it, I found it quite straightforward. 

Kirsty says her wedding day was the 'happiest' of her life and that she loved looking at the pictures afterwards 

'The Forza Raspberry K2 capsules were a big help. I started walking a lot and they gave me real energy and helped me to get out more.'

At the end of her weight loss journey Kirsty was finally at the right weight to fit into her wedding dress. 'It meant so much to me,' she said. 'The dress fitted me perfectly and looked just as wonderful when I had bought it as a size 16 all those months ago. 

'My wedding day was the happiest of my life and I loved looking at the pictures afterwards. 

'I had the wedding album I had always dreamed of.'
