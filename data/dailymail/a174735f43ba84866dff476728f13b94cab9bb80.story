A 17-year-old boy and his friend have been accused of shooting dead the teenager's mother and seriously injuring his father at their Oregon home.

Brett Angus Pearson was pulled over by police about 90 minutes after the body of his mother, Michelle Yvonne, was found on Wednesday night.

His friend, Robert Daniel Miller, who is also facing murder and attempted murder charges, was arrested at a Salem motel he had checked into.

Pearson allegedly posted a chilling message on Facebook in the hours before the murder, and friends of the teenager say he had talked previously of killing his mom.

Charged: Pearson, 17, is to be tried as an adult for murder and attempted murder

In the Facebook post, made at 5.12pm on the day of the murder, he wrote: 'Life's about to change in a number of ways!'

The comment was 'liked' by his co-accused, Miller.

'Brett told me a couple months ago, that in a joking but serious manner, "Iâ€™m going to kill my parent",' Teya Zimick told Koin.

'All my friends laughed because we were like, "You are not going to kill your parents, Brett".'

She added that when she brought it up recently, Pearson said he had been joking.

Police arrived at the Pearson family home in Keizer just before 11.30pm, after an alarm was activated inside it.

When officers went inside they found Mrs
 Pearson had died from gunshot wounds. Her husband had been shot and was
 taken to hospital. He is expected to survive.

No motive has been suggested for the killing and friends of the Pearson family were shocked to hear of it.

'I've known them for 10 years, just 
really nice people. I 
don't know what would have brought this on,' Theresa Whisenhunt told KGW.

Pearson
 and Miller have been charged with murder, attempted murder and 
conspiracy to commit murder. They will be tried as adults.

Message: A few hours before the body of his mother was discovered, Pearson posted this statement on Facebook, which was liked by Miller
