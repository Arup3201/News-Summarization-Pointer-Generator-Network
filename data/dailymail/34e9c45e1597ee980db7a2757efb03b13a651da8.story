The US President's brother has got married to a care worker in Oxford - and received a personal phone call of congratulation from elder sibling Barack.

Although his brother is one of the world's most powerful men, Ben Obama opted for simple surroundings when he wed care worker Lily Achoch at the Oxford registry office.

Shortly before the ceremony, Ben, 42, took the President's call on his mobile phone from Washington DC.

He said: 'It was great hearing him because Barack's the most important politician in the world and is naturally extremely busy.

'But he took time out for family matters, wishing me and Lily hearty congratulations. He told me he was looking forward to meeting her and that will happen soon.

'He hoped Lily and I would enjoy a great life together.'

Ben, who was a guest of the President in the Oval Office after he was elected as America's first black president, joked how Barack had not mentioned a wedding gift.

'Perhaps it's in the post - I hope so,' he quipped.

They happy couple picked their venue due to its proximity to nearby Wantage, where Lily lives and works.

The two brothers are close and 
recently chatted on the phone after terrorists blew up a shopping mall 
in Nairobi, Kenya, where Ben is based.

The property developer also owns a restaurant in the Kenyan capital, where he met Lily, 33, in 2004.

The couple have two children - a son aged four years and a daughter aged eight years.

Ben is the son of Barack's father, Kenyan Barack Senior, and the president's stepmother Kezia - who moved to Bracknell, Berkshire, from Kenya in 2003.

Barack Senior, who was a central figure in the President's 1995 memoir, Dreams From My Father,  wed Kezia, now 73, a in a Kenyan village ceremony in 1954.

They had a son and daughter together before Barack Senior left to study in the United States in 1959.

He went on to marry American Ann Dunham, the President's mother - who gave birth to Barack in Hawaii in 1961, and then another woman.

However, he would often return to his first wife Kezia in Kenya in his role as a Government economist.

Ben was born as Bernard Obama in Kenya in 1970 and was 12 years old when his father died in a car crash in Narobi in 1982.
