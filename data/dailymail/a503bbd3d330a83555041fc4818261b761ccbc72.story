Her mother, Kharletta Mciver, said that another girl then came forward to let her know that Kamari had been in contact with a man on messaging service, Kik. 

Ms Mciver told CBS: 'Someone else just came to my apartment…to say that my daughter had been seen in the past with someone from the building next door. 

'That’s the direction she was walking in when she left.'

Her mother said that  her daughter was punished on Thursday for using a cellphone without permission but that she just wanted her daughter home.
