Labour was forced to backtrack over key public spending commitments yesterday as the Tories warned of a hidden tax and debt bombshell costing every working family £1,200 if Ed Miliband wins power.

In an echo of the 1992 election campaign, Chancellor George Osborne, flanked by four senior Cabinet colleagues, unveiled Treasury figures suggesting that Labour has already made almost £21billion of unfunded spending pledges.

Conservative strategists are planning to echo the party’s ‘tax bombshell’ warning about Labour ahead of the 1992 election – the last time it won power outright. And focusing his fire on Mr Miliband, Mr Osborne insisted the Labour leader was ‘just not up to the job’ – this time an echo of the Tories’ attacks on Neil Kinnock.

The campaign launch infuriated Labour’s Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, who condemned what he called a ‘dodgy Tory dossier riddled with untruths and errors on every page’.

But Mr Balls quickly declared that he would not reverse many of the austerity measures included in the document that Labour has spent years criticising – including pay curbs for teachers, nurses, Armed Forces and other public sector workers. 

He also insisted cuts in arts funding, condemned repeatedly by Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman, would go ahead, while a £500million policy to stop councils dumping food waste in landfill sites has been abandoned.

Senior Conservatives said they were delighted Labour was being forced to confirm that many of the cuts it has attacked since 2010 would not in fact be reversed if they take power in May.

An 82-page document set out the cost of every policy announcement by Labour since declaring it would make no unfunded commitments in mid-2013. Figures were drawn up by Treasury officials under rules allowing Opposition policies to be costed by civil servants.

The document detailed £5.2billion in spending cuts which Labour has opposed, which the Tories assumed would be reversed, and £18billion in new spending commitments they said had been made by Mr Miliband and his frontbenchers. Only £2.5billion in new taxes and cuts have been identified by Labour, leaving it with a total of £20.746billion to find in 2015/16, according to the Tories.

The Chancellor and the four other Cabinet ministers published a dossier claiming Labour had made more than £20billion in unfunded spending commitments in the first year of the next Parliament

Taking questions from journalists, Mr Osborne dismissed suggestions that the document was 'nonsense'

The document said voters would have reasonably believed Labour intended to cancel next year’s local authority cuts, which would mean spending an extra £3.35billion of taxpayers’ money. It highlighted 14 quotes from Labour frontbenchers attacking austerity measures affecting everything from libraries to public lavatories and street lighting.

Mr Osborne, joined at a press conference by Home Secretary Theresa May, Commons Leader William Hague, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan and Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, accused Labour of trying to ‘have it both ways’, opposing coalition cuts but refusing to admit it would mean higher taxes and borrowing.

Mr Balls insisted Labour did not have any unfunded commitments and questioned the involvement of Treasury officials in producing the document. 

‘It isn’t an impartial exercise, but a political smear based on false assumptions made by Tory advisers, including dozens of claims which are not even Labour’s policies,’ he said.

The Shadow Chancellor, who derided the ‘Politburo-style’ line-up of Cabinet ministers, said Labour would stick to spending budgets for 2015/16 inherited from the coalition, and would therefore make no money available for public sector pay rises that year.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg attacked both the main parties and set out his own plans to hit the wealthy with higher taxes to fund more NHS spending.

He said: ‘Boy, if there was a lot of weary cynicism already, after the last three days it has just gone through the roof. A lot of the public must be thinking: “Are we really going to have months more of this to and fro between Labour and the Conservatives?”.’

Ann Summers boss Jacqueline Gold was unveiled as the Tories’ latest campaign weapon

Ann Summers boss Jacqueline Gold was unveiled as the Tories’ latest campaign weapon yesterday.

The businesswoman who brought the Rampant Rabbit vibrator to Britain sat in the front row as George Osborne and his colleagues attacked Labour over spending.

Miss Gold, 54, pictured, who has a £240million fortune, transformed her father David’s business Ann Summers by making the sex-toy and lingerie chain more female-friendly. It has 150 stores and 7,000 party planners.

A Tory source said it had not been decided how prominent she would be in the campaign, but added: ‘She’s a successful entrepreneur. I think we should praise success rather than follow Labour’s culture of envy.’

Miss Gold said: ‘I have always been a supporter of the Conservative Party.’
