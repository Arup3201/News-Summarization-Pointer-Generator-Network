Thousands of well-qualified students face being denied places at popular universities as deep cuts are announced in the numbers they are allowed to recruit.

Three quarters of universities face losing up to 900 first-year undergraduates compared with last year.

The recruitment limits for courses beginning in the autumn were announced as the Coalition battles to rein in the soaring costs of offering student loans to cover tuition fees of up to £9,000-a-year.

Cuts: Thousands of students face missing out on places at their chosen university

University bosses condemned the squeeze on places at a time of soaring youth unemployment and warned that talented students now face missing out on places at sought-after universities.

Figures published yesterday by the Higher Education Funding Council suggest that 98 out of 129 universities face a cut in their first-year student numbers this autumn.

Some 34 institutions face losing at least 10 per cent of their numbers compared with last year, including the University of East London with 12.6 per cent.

Universities have an opportunity to counter the projected cut in student numbers by targeting applicants with AAB grades or better at A-level.

This is because ministers have relaxed recruitment quotas for applicants with these grades, allowing universities to give places to as many as they can attract.

But only the most elite institutions are expected to gain significant numbers of students in this way.

University of East London is set to lose 12.6 per cent of it's student intake in September

Many leading institutions currently stand to see a drop in their first-year intake unless they aggressively recruit students with AAB grades or better.

These include some in the prestigious Russell and 1994 groups of institutions, such as Liverpool, with an estimated cut of 6.4 per cent, Leeds with 5.1 per cent, Newcastle with 4.9 per cent and Manchester with 4.6 per cent.

Under a Coalition policy aimed at driving down student fees, about 10,000 places have been redistributed to local further education colleges.

The Oxford and Cherwell Valley College, for example, will see a massive 1,867 per cent increase in places.

But fears were raised last night that bright applicants who miss the AAB grade threshold could find it more difficult to win places.

Universities are thought to be making fewer initial offers at these lower grades.

All offers that have already been made will be respected but institutions will have less leeway to help borderline candidates who just miss their conditional offers.

Universities can counter the projected cut in student numbers by targeting applicants with AAB grades or better at A-level

Professor Michael Farthing, vice-chancellor of the University of Sussex, said: 'The information released today rubber stamps the fact that many excellent students will be denied places at their first choice universities.'

He criticised a 'push to cut-price education' after 20,000 degree course places were stripped from universities and diverted to institutions charging the lowest fees.

'Furthermore, with uncapped student places restricted only to applicants with A-level grades of AAB or above there is every chance that some excellent institutions will lose further places,' he added.

'There are only so many AAB students to go around and they are likely to be snapped up by a few self-declared "elite" institutions, able to rely on historical brand prestige to attract applications.

'Any university losing AAB students will not be allowed to take on students with different grades, such as two Bs and an A, to take their place.

'This means that many talented students will be denied places at highly regarded universities.'

Minister for Universities and Science The Rt Hon David Willetts MP has defended the policy

Professor Farthing, who is chairman of the so-called 1994 group of institutions, added: 'Restricting competition only to self-selecting elites and cut-price providers reduces the level of choice available to the vast majority of students.'

In total, there will be 10,910 fewer places available in universities and colleges than in 2011.

The forecast student numbers for 2012 assume universities maintain their share of students with AAB grades, or the equivalent for other qualifications.

Institutions face even more severe cuts if they lose these top students to rivals seeking to shore up their own numbers.

Oxford, Cambridge, Bristol, Durham and Imperial College London are among those estimated to see an increase in places.

This is partly because they have been granted a share of 1,000 places aimed at poorer applicants who miss out on top AAB grades.

Sally Hunt, general secretary of the University and College Union, said: 'At a time when record numbers of people are out of work, the government should be making it easier for people to access education.

'Axing grants for college students, tripling university fees and slashing teaching budgets and student places is exactly what the government should not be doing.'

Universities Minister David Willetts said: 'We want a student-focused higher education sector, more choice over where to study and a renewed focus on the quality of the student experience.

'That's why we're freeing up centralised number controls, improving information for prospective students and driving a new focus on the academic experience.'

Recent figures suggest that taxpayers will be burdened with £191billion of debt as the Government subsidises student loans to cover fees of up to £9,000-a-year and living costs.

Officials have estimated that the amount lent to students will balloon to record levels by 2047 before the Treasury starts to recoup the losses from graduates.
