Alan Mutch, 45, was found to have 19 wraps of cannabis weighing more than an ounce tied to his penis with an elastic band

A drug dealer has been jailed after police caught him with 19 wraps of drugs tied to his penis.

Alan Mutch was targeted after police received reports of a man peddling drugs in Canterbury, Kent, on January 14.

When they pulled the 45-year-old over to search him they discovered 19 wraps of cannabis in his underpants.

The wraps, which weighed more than an ounce, had been tied to his genitals using an elastic band.

Jim Harvey, prosecuting, told Canterbury Crown Court this week that Mutch was hauled over at 9.40am by officers.

‘It was then they saw the defendant 
walking down the hill and decided to conduct a search under the Misuse 
Of Drugs Act,’ he said.

‘Suffice it to say that 19 wraps were then found somewhere on his person.’

When officers searched him further they found £670 in cash and 48 wraps of heroin in two more plastic bags which were said to be ‘each the size of a golf ball’.

Phil Rowley, defending, said Mutch had been sentenced in 2010 to four years in prison for dealing drugs.

He said Mutch had ‘struggled’ since his release from prison in 2012 and had been planning to harm himself by taking an overdose.

Mutch also claimed that before being jailed previously he had hidden two bags of heroin in a nearby field.

Mr Rowley said: ‘Upon his release in 2012 he 
struggled and consulted his GP on five occasions following his release 
and was diagnosed with a depressive illness.

‘He was in such a depressed state that he was thinking about harming 
himself. He was at a very low ebb because of his difficulties.’

Mutch, of Canterbury, was jailed for two-and-half years after admitting possession of the drugs with intent to supply.
