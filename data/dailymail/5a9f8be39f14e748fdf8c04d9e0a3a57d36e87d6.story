The Big Freeze continued overnight with temperatures plummeting as low as -12c (10.4f), the same as the Himalayas.

Forecasters predicted up to four 
inches of snow in many parts of the country today, with daytime 
temperatures not expected to rise above 2c (36f).

The AA has told drivers to double check 
their vehicles, pack cold weather provisions including food and warm 
clothes, and take a fully charged mobile phone before setting off.

Deep and crisp and relaxing: Wild Ponies enjoy the snow in the Quantock Hills in Somerset

Early yesterday in Chesham, 
Buckinghamshire, the mercury dropped to -11.1c (12f) – the coldest 
reading of the winter so far – and it was almost as icy in areas 
including the South West, Wales, Yorkshire and Northumbria.

And as the day progressed, 
temperatures in some places struggled to get above freezing. At 3pm in 
High Wycombe, it was still only -0.7c (30.7f).

Temperatures in London and East Anglia did not get any higher than 2c or 3c (37f).

Despite the conditions, wild ponies 
in the Quantock Hills, Somerset, were happy to relax on the snowy 
ground, as the picture above taken by Daily Mail reader Pat Comins 
shows.

With the cold snap expected to last 
until Tuesday, the Met Office issued a level three severe weather 
warning, which requires the Health Service to prepare for a rise in 
sickness in vulnerable groups.

Weather warnings: Met Office snow warning for today - people in the yellow areas should 'be aware' and in the orange areas 'be prepared'

Met Office spokesman Helen Chivers 
said yesterday: ‘It could be as low as -12c in some rural areas tonight,
with an average of -6c (21f) to -8c (18f).’ A -12c figure would put us 
on a par with the Himalayan foothills yesterday.

Miss Chivers predicted that milder weather on its way from the Atlantic would trigger rain, sleet or snow later today.

She said: ‘This will affect the whole
of the UK, including England with up to four inches of snow falling in 
the Isle of Wight, London, Birmingham and Newcastle.’ She added: 
‘Motorists must be ready to expect some disruption.’

The Department for Transport says it 
is well prepared for severe weather, with salt stocks standing at more 
than 2.4million tons – a million more than last year. 

Yesterday the BBC Breakfast forecast for Wales put the temperature in Bangor at an incredible -99c instead of -9c overnight.

Presenter Behnaz Akhgar failed to 
spot the blunder as she stood in front of a TV map showing the figure. A
BBC insider said: ‘It’s often cold in Bangor but never that cold. We 
had a chilly reception from the viewers about it though.’

The
cold weather has taken a serious toll on drivers, with the AA reporting
their rescue teams attending around double the usual number of 
breakdowns.

Call-outs 
peaked yesterday morning at more than 1,800 every hour and the the group
expects to attend around 19,000 for the day, double its usual workload.

Gavin Hill-Smith, a spokesman for the 
AA, warned drivers against 'complacency' if they are planning to take to
the roads this weekend.

'Unfortunately
some people are still going out rather ill-prepared,' he said. 'We have got very cold temperatures and I think that 
is going to continue over the weekend. People should be very well 
prepared.

'We
have seen a massive increase in breakdowns over the past few days 
because of the cold weather. You don't need to have snow and ice to 
cause problems.'

Mr Hill-Smith said anyone making 
journeys by road should make sure they check weather and traffic reports
before leaving, pack extra clothes, and make sure they bring along 
high-calorie snacks in case they get stranded in the cold weather.

'It's worth as well if you are visiting friends and family then tell them when to expect you,' he added.

But when warmer weather returns, 
there is likely to be a new set of problems, the AA warns. It is also 
warning road users about a likely increase in potholes when the 
conditions thaw out.

Paul 
Watters, head of roads policy at the AA, said: 'After several days of 
sub-zero temperatures, we’re expecting a rash of potholes when the 
current freeze ends. The cold penetrates deep into the road surface, 
which can collapse when it thaws out, creating a pothole.

'Road
users, particularly those on two wheels, will need to be on the 
lookout, especially on secondary roads. Damage to wheels and tyres is 
quite common, so if you notice any unusual steering or other driving 
characteristics, get the vehicle checked at a garage or tyre 
specialist.'

The icy weather has even hit Rome, with snow falling in the Italian capital for the first time in 26 years.

Dramatic: Icicles hang from a bridge in Smethwick, Birmingham, while the canal it spans is covered in great sheets of ice

The city is usually blessed by a 
moderate climate but the snowfall prompted authorities stop visitors 
from entering the Colosseum, the Roman Forum and the Palatine Hill, the 
former home of Rome's ancient emperors.

Britain's
deep freeze has seen daytime temperatures plummet four or five degrees 
lower than average for February - traditionally the coldest month of the
year.

While the 
sub-zero temperatures continue, a new shelter has opened for rough 
sleepers in the capital, funded by London Mayor Boris Johnson and run by
homeless charity St Mungo's.

Plans
are in place throughout the winter to ensure the 24-hour shelter in 
Lambeth is open and ready to receive people whenever three consecutive 
nights of freezing temperatures are predicted.

And when in Rome... make sure you wrap up warm

Anyone fancy an open top bus tour through Rome? That Italian capital was hit by its first snowfall in 26 years stopping visitors from entering the Colosseum, the Roman Forum and the Palatine Hill, the former home of Rome's ancient emperors

This is a sight to prove that fashion comes first, whatever the weather. The pictures were taken in Rome, which has just experienced its first substantial snowfall since 1986. Despite the  conditions, the two ladies pictured eschewed sensible shoes and opted for their usual high heels. Elsewhere in the city they were  taking things more seriously. Tourist sites such as the Colosseum and the Forum were closed on health and safety grounds.
