Andy Murray claimed a spot in the fourth round of Wimbledon tonight after a thrilling match played long into the night

Having taken the first set the Briton was forced to claw his way back in to the game as he dropped the second set and looked in trouble in the third.

But, following a delay for the roof and floodlights to come on, he pegged back Cypriot opponent Marcos Baghdatis to win the tie 7-5, 6-3, 7-5, 6-1.

It looked as though he might not have time to confirm his spot in the next round with fears that the game would run past the 11pm deadline at the All Lawn Tennis Club.

Fans, who queued overnight for 
tickets to see the 25-year-old in action 
cheered and waved their Union Jack flags all the way through the night as officials allowed play to carry on just after the scheduled closure.

Council regulations prohibit matches to continue after 11pm but with the win in Murray's grasp the game concluded in the nick of time.

In a bizarre twist to the tie Murray was at risk of throwing the match away as he dropped a handful of points after balls, kept in his pocket on his service games, fell out during play.

A knee injury also seemed to be threatening his push for a fourth round berth, which he had strapped up, but he finally claimed the win.

As the last Briton left in the competition, Murray - once again - carries the hopes of the nation on his shoulders.

Outside the packed court thousands of fans have even flocked to 'Henman Hill' inside the All Lawn Tennis Club to watch the Scot on the big screen.

Prior to the tie bookmakers slashed the odds on him winning Wimbledon from 10/1 to 11/2, in the wake of Rafael Nadal's elimination on Friday.

And the Scot has extra incentive to beat the world number 24, who knocked him out of the fourth round back in 2006 - the Cypriot is coached by his former trainer Miles Maclagan.

Maclagan, who worked with Murray between 2007 and 2010, has been coaching Baghdatis since last summer.

And
he believes his former boss will be feeling the pressure of Rafael 
Nadal's elimination - which makes Murray favourite to reach the final.

Of the Nadal result, he said: 'It affects Andy a lot. His job will be to stay thinking about the next match.

'The
pressure increases for him because everyone's looking to see if he's 
going to play (Roger) Federer or (Novak) Djokovic in the final now.'

Murray said he did not think have his former coach in the opposing camp would have any bearing on the match.

He received another boost yesterday when potential opponent Milos Raonic was beaten by America's Sam Querrey.

The British number one revealed he avoids watching replays of his games, and also tries to steer clear of lucky routines, although he does avoid wearing new socks.

Writing on a BBC blog, he said he puts on a new shirt and shorts for each match - players are given around 15 at the start of a grand slam - but added: 'one thing I never wear is new socks. They can be a little slippery'.

Fans were queuing yesterday morning - more than 24 hours before the match - to get tickets.

Sarah Johnson, 27, and fiance Graham Johnson, 26, left their home in Mile End, east London, early to set up camp.

'I've been before but Graham never has, I'm pretty sure we'll get Centre Court tickets,' she said.

'Although I'm a big Murray fan I've never seen him play live. I got quarter finals tickets for Queen's and then he went out. We're really looking forward to it.'

Seeing red: Radek Stepanek changes his trainers

Wimbledon. Famous for strawberries, 
Pimm's and wearing white. Which made Radek Stepanek's decision to wear 
red and blue trainers all the more confusing.

The Czech didn't get away 
with it though.

Umpire Kerrilyn Cramer was on the case
and ordered Stepanek to change his trainers.

The oddest thing was that 
Stepanek had a white set of trainers in his bag ready to put on.

Ryan Giggs was joined by Boris and 
Martina Navratilova, rugby Owen Farrell and England captain Chris 
Robshaw as well as England cricket captain Andrew Strauss and former 
international Phil Tufnell.

And there was room for Hollywood icon
Dustin Hoffman, who took a seat alongside Venus Willians to watch her 
sister Serena in action against Jie Zheng of China.

After an interrupted Friday, forecasters warned the rain could return today to wreak havoc on the schedule.

But the showers stayed away and by the time play started on Centre and Number 1 courts Wimbledon was basking in sunshine.

Despite the weather, Wimbledon faced another thriller last night when six-time champion Roger Federer found himself two points away from being knocked out, but fought back to beat Julien Benneteau.

Heather Watson, who lost her place in the grand slam to world number three Agnieszka Radwanska, again praised the crowd for their support.

The 20-year-old, from Guernsey, who broke down in tears after she was knocked out last year, said: 'I held it till I got off the court, and then was just a bit, you know, let it all out.'

Of the crowd, she said: 'They were absolutely amazing throughout the whole match.

'I just want to do well for them and keep coming back and playing for my country.'

Asked what she will do with her Â£38,875 prize money, Watson said: 'I think I'll deserve a little present for myself', and said she also plans to take her team-mates out for a 'nice dinner'.

But the 20-year-old, who previously said she was eating smoked salmon and eggs every morning, added: 'I've had enough salmon this week. I'm done with the salmon.'

Rufus the Hawk, patrolling Centre Court this week - before thieves struck

The hawk that patrols Wimbledon to deter pigeons has been stolen, police said.

Detectives are investigating the theft of Harrier Hawk Rufus, who was stolen along with his cage overnight between Thursday and Friday from a car parked in Wimbledon.

A spokesman said Rufus was in the car parked on a private drive in Dunstall Road with the rear window open for ventilation.

The hawk, which deters pigeons at the All England Club purely by his presence, is also a family pet, he said.

'The family has become very attached to the bird who is now four-and-a-half years old.

'They are distressed over the theft and are appealing for help to recover the bird."

Rufus has become a well-known fixture at the south-west London club, with visitors often stopping to ask for photos with the hawk.

He even has his own Twitter account, but has not tweeted for a day.

His last tweet was before Rafael Nadal's shock exit from the tournament, when he said: 'Murray is through, Rafa is down 2-1 (!), Ward played brilliantly but lost to Mardy Fish, and Italy are beating Germany 1-0!'
