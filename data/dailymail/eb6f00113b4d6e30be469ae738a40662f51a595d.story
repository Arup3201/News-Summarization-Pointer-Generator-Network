A suburban New York newspaper that outraged gun owners by posting the names and addresses of residents with handgun permits removed the information from its website Friday.

The Journal News took down the data just three days after the state enacted a gun control law that included privacy provisions for permit holders.

The provisions were a reaction to interactive maps the newspaper published on LoHud.com that pinpointed thousands of permit holders in Westchester and Rockland counties.

Gun rights activists had immediately 
complained that permit owners' privacy was being violated. They said the
 map could guide burglars to their homes while police groups claimed the
 map could lead ex-convicts to the officers who had put them away.

The addresses of some Journal News 
staffers were posted online, and threats were called in to the 
newspaper's offices. The newspaper hired armed guards in response.

Janet Hasson, president and publisher 
of The Journal News Media Group, said in an emailed statement, "While 
the new law does not require us to remove the data, we believe that 
doing so complies with its spirit."

She said the maps had been viewed 
nearly 1.2 million times since they were published Dec. 23. The 
newspaper sought the records under the state Freedom of Information Law 
after the Dec. 14 elementary school shooting in Newtown, Conn., where a 
gunman who had killed his mother at home killed 20 first-graders and six
 educators and then committed suicide.

The maps remained online late Friday but could no longer be manipulated to find names and addresses.

State Sen. Greg Ball, the most vocal 
opponent of the posting, said, "Thank God The Journal News has finally 
realized the error in their judgment and done the right thing. ... I am 
proud to have passed legislation keeping The Journal News from doing 
this ever again."

On Tuesday, as part of a gun control 
bill, the state Legislature passed and Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed new 
regulations that give permit holders several ways to opt out of the 
public record.

Applicants can ask to be exempted 
because they are police officers or served on criminal-case juries or 
are victims of domestic violence. They also can just say they might be 
subjected to harassment.

Hasson said Friday, "One of our core missions as a newspaper is to 
empower our readers with as much information as possible on the critical
 issues they face, and guns have certainly become a top issue since the 
massacre in nearby Newtown, Conn."

The paper caused a stir on December 23 when it listed thousands of 
pistol permit holders in suburban Westchester and Rockland counties just
 north of New York City in an interactive map on its website.

Editor Caryn A. McBride hired gun-toting security guards to patrol the paper's offices amid a flurry of angry emails and phone calls in the following days.

The paper hired the increased security from RGA Investigations & Security, a firm based in New City that provides services like protection and security guard certification, according to the Times.

The news came just days after the Journal News announced plans to publish an expanded list ofÂ  even more permit-holding locals.

On the list: As well as Journal News the website Gawker published a 446-page list of licensed gun owners in New York City

Along with an article entitled 'The 
gun owner next door: What you don't know about the weapons in your 
neighborhood,' the Journal News map was compiled in response to the December 14 
shooting deaths of 20 children and six adults in Newtown, Connecticut, 
editors of the Gannett Corp.-owned newspaper said.

The next batch of names will be 
permit holders in suburban Putnam County, New York, where the county 
clerk told the newspaper it is still compiling information.

Some 44,000 people are licensed to 
own pistols in the three counties, the newspaper said. Owners of rifles 
and shotguns do not need permits, the newspaper said.

The publication prompted outrage, particularly on social media sites, among gun owners.

'Do you fools realize that you also 
made a map for criminals to use to find homes to rob that have no guns 
in them to protect themselves?' Rob Seubert of Silver Spring, Maryland, 
posted on the newspaper's web site. 'What a bunch of liberal boobs you 
all are.'

Republican state Senator Greg Ball of
 Patterson, New York, said he planned to introduce legislation to keep 
permit information private except to prosecutors and police.

A similar bill that he introduced earlier as an Assemblyman failed in the state Assembly.

'The asinine editors at the Journal 
News have once again gone out of their way to place a virtual scarlet 
letter on law abiding firearm owners throughout the region,' Ball wrote 
on his Senate web site.

The newspaper's editor and vice 
president of news, CynDee Royle, earlier in the week defended the 
decision to list the permit holders.

'We knew publication of the database 
would be controversial, but we felt sharing as much information as we 
could about gun ownership in our area was important in the aftermath of 
the Newtown shootings,' she said.

Some critics retaliated by posting reporters' and editors' addresses and other personal information online.

Howard Good, a journalism professor 
at the State University of New York at New Paltz, called the critics' 
response childish and petulant.

'It doesn't move the issue of gun 
control to the level of intelligent public discussion,' he said. 'Instead, it transforms what should be a rational public debate on a 
contentious issue into ugly gutter fighting.'

Good said the information about permit holders was public and, if presented in context, served a legitimate interest.

But media critic Al Tompkins of the 
Florida-based Poynter Institute wrote online this week that the 
newspaper's reporting had not gone far enough to justify the permit 
holders' loss of privacy.

'If journalists could show flaws in 
the gun permitting system, that would be newsworthy,' he said. 'Or, for 
example, if gun owners were exempted from permits because of political 
connections, then journalists could better justify the privacy 
invasion.'

Tompkins said he feared the dispute might prompt lawmakers to play to privacy fears.

'The net effect of the abuse of public
 records from all sides may well be a public distaste for opening 
records, which would be the biggest mistake of all,' he said.
