Hollywood may like to boast of its liberal ideals but it is still a man's world in many ways, a new study has shown.

Not only are women dramatically under-represented on screen and behind the scenes, but even the most successful female stars are paid significantly less than men.

Last year, of the 10 biggest payments to actors per film, not one went to a woman, according to research cited by the U.S. campaign group Women’s Media Centre.

Angelina Jolie was the top earning actress last year after taking home a pay packet of $33 million. That figure was dwarfed however by the highest-earning man – Robert Downey Jr – who earned $75 million

Quoting analysis by the New York Film 
Academy of the 2013 earnings of Hollywood’s best paid 10 male and 10 
female stars, the study found that while Angelina Jolie was the 
top-earning actress, she lagged behind all but two of the men in the 
list.

And while, at $33 million, her pay packet was enormous, it was dwarfed by the highest-earning man – Robert Downey Jr – who earned $75 million.

At the same time, the study found that age appeared to be far more of a dominant factor in women’s earning potential.

Like Downey, star of the Iron Man films, most of the men are at least in their 40s, with two – Tom Cruise and Denzel Washington – in their 50s and Liam Neeson aged 61.

In contrast, most of the women are in their 20s and 30s while the oldest, Sandra Bullock, is just 49.

The gender inequality continues on-screen, said the report.

At aged 23, Jennifer Lawrence (pictured in American Hustle) was the youngest female on the list, also coming just behind Jolie earning $26 million. Channing Tatum (right) came second behind Downey on the men's list earning $60 million last year

Hugh Jackman was the third highest Hollywood earner in 2013, according to the New York Film Academy, after earning $55m

Kristen Stewart, 23 (left), earned $21.5 million in 2013, while Jennifer Aniston bucked the trend of younger actresses making the most money. The 45-year-old earned $20 million

Only six per cent of the top 100 films made in 2012 cast the sexes in roughly equal numbers.

Women accounted for only 29 percent of the speaking roles and all too often, they were primarily there to look decorative - roughly a third involved wearing sexually revealing clothes or being partially naked.

Indeed, female characters were four times more likely to wear sexually revealing clothes or have to strip off than men.

The survey also noted a disturbing rise in younger women actors being asked to shed their clothes on screen – the percentage of teenage girls depicted with some nudity has increased a third since 2007.

Behind the camera, the gender inequality is getting even worse. Of last year’s 250 top-grossing films, women accounted for 16 percent of directors and other senior roles.

The study also looked at the representation of ethnic minorities and found they, too, are woefully under-represented. A majority of films had casts where fewer than one in 10 of the actors were black.

‘We know that what we see on screen is in direct proportion to who’s calling the shots,’ said Prof Stacy Smith, who led the study.

‘We were able to look across 500 films and see who was the director…and what we have is a representational road block.’
