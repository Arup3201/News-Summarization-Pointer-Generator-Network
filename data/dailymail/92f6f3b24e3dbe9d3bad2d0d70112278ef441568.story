Mourning: The showbiz world has paid tribute to agent and producer Addison Cresswell after he died aged 53

One of Britain's top comedy agents, who helped launch the careers of stars such as Jonathan Ross and Michael McIntyre, has died aged 53.

Addison Cresswell represented dozens of well-known stars, and negotiated the BBC deal which made Mr Ross one of the wealthiest entertainers on UK television.

Tributes poured out from the showbiz world after it was announced that the agent and producer had died in his sleep of an apparent heart attack on Sunday night.

'Really sad to hear about Addison 
Cresswell passing,' Dermot O'Leary wrote on Twitter. 'Titan of the 
industry. Real old school firebrand and gent.'

Jack
 Whitehall tweeted: 'Sad news about Addison Cresswell - last time I saw 
him was last week giving me a bear hug as I came off stage. An amazing 
character we've lost.'

James
 Corden called the agent 'an incredible man, an incredible talent', 
while Stephen Fry said he was 'a larger-than-life impresario'.

David Baddiel added: 'Christmas lights in comedy-world a little darker this year.'

Mr Cresswell's management company Off the Kerb has represented comedians such as Lee Evans, Jo Brand, Jack Dee and Alan Carr.

Through
 the firm Open Mike, he produced popular TV shows including Live At The 
Apollo, Stand up For The Week and Channel 4's Comedy Gala.

Clients: Mr Cresswell represented top stars such as Jonathan Ross and Michael McIntyre

The agent - described by many as a no-nonsense character - started his career as a student by becoming entertainments officer at Brighton Polytechnic.

His first ever client, at a time when he ran his business from a kitchen table, was the comic poet John Hegley.

Mr Cresswell built up a business empire, with his acts dominating the majority of TV comedy shows.

He entered the spotlight in 2006 when he
 landed Mr Ross an Â£18million contract with the BBC for his chat show 
and Radio 2 programme.

The cause of his death has not been officially announced, but the Radio Times reported that he had suffered a heart attack.

Tribute: James Corden was one of many stars who took to Twitter in memory of the agent and producer

Praise: Mr Cresswell was known within the entertainment industry as a larger-than-life character

A spokesman said: 'Addison will be fondly remembered by all whose lives he touched as a devoted mentor, a dear friend and an unforgettable character. He will be sorely missed.

'He leaves behind a proud legacy in his tireless charity work, initiating and organising the annual Channel 4 Comedy Gala in aid of Great Ormond Street Hospital.

'It was his dearest wish to raise enough to fund the opening of a brand new wing of the hospital, a goal that is now in sight.

He added: 'He is survived by his beloved wife, Shelley, his dogs Bonnie and Nessie and many, many pet fish.'
