The BBC boss who pocketed a £1million golden goodbye insisted yesterday he had not been greedy.

Mark Byford said the BBC wanted him to have the controversial pay-off, and he refused to hand it back.

The former deputy director general said he had done nothing wrong even though the settlement, at the heart of a scandal over generous pay-offs to BBC executives, was nearly double what he was contractually entitled to.

The former BBC deputy director-general, Mark Byford, has defended his near £1 million corporation pay off - denying that he had been 'greedy'

Speaking publicly for the first time 
since he was singled out in a devastating report into the scandal by a 
spending watchdog, Mr Byford said the payment was ‘properly approved’.

But the 55-year-old was criticised by
 MPs who said his refusal to pay the money back showed the ‘shameless 
culture of entitlement at the top of the BBC’.

Speaking on Radio 5 Live’s Victoria Derbyshire show, Mr Byford sounded nervous as he defended his pay-off.

Mark Thompson, Director General of the BBC, and Lord Patten, BBC Trust Chairman arrive to give evidence to the Leveson Inquiry in London. Thompson told the Public Accounts Committee that the pay-off to Mr Byford, who left in 2011, was needed so he would remain 'focused' on his job

‘I absolutely don’t think that it was
 greed on my part at all,’ he said. ‘I lost my job, I was made 
redundant, I was given the terms I was given by the BBC.

‘I left when I was told to leave by 
the BBC, and after 32 years of working there, where I was devoted to the
 corporation, the last thing that I would ever think or feel was that I 
would want to have greed [sic].’

Mr Byford’s pay-off was heavily criticised in the National Audit Office’s scathing report into the pay-off fiasco in July.

When he left the BBC in 2011, he was 
handed a £474,500 ‘contractual’ redundancy payment, a further £474,500 
‘pay in lieu of notice’ and £73,000 for ‘accrued leave’ – holidays he 
had not taken.

Former BBC2 controller Roly Keating was given a £375,000 pay-off but returned the money after learning it had not been properly authorised

But the watchdog found he had worked 
eight months of his 12-month notice period, meaning he was paid at least
 £316,333 more than he was contractually owed.

However, Mr Byford – who receives a 
£163,400-a-year BBC pension and has spent his early retirement writing a
 history book – defended the huge sum, saying it was what the BBC wanted
 him to have.

The BBC has faced repeated criticism over huge salaries for stars and payouts to managers beyond what their contracts demanded.

It is thought stars like Graham Norton and Gary Lineker both earn about £1.5million a year at the BBC.

Earlier
 this year it emerged that the BBC had paid out £369million in golden 
goodbyes over eight years, including £60million to senior managers.

Severance
 payments included £470,000 to former director general George Entwistle 
after only 54 days in the job and £680,000 to ex-chief operating officer
 Caroline Thomson.

The National Audit Office said the 
BBC paid £1.4 million more than it was contractually obliged to pay to 
22 senior managers in the three years to December 2012 and that it paid 
£60 million to 401 senior managers over an eight-year period.

Accepting it was ‘a lot of money’, he said: ‘I lost my job... I agreed to do what the BBC wanted.’

Mr Byford was repeatedly asked whether he would repay any of the money, but refused to answer directly.

‘It was properly approved, and it was
 the terms I was given,’ he said. ‘In that context I absolutely think 
I’ve done no wrong... I did what the BBC asked.’

Tory MP Steve Barclay, who sits on the Commons public accounts committee, criticised Mr Byford.

He said: ‘At a time when many are 
struggling to pay the licence fee, nothing better illustrates the 
shameless culture of entitlement at the top of the BBC than the refusal 
to hand back money he should never have been given.’

Mr Byford’s stance is in stark 
contrast to that of his former colleague Roly Keating, who was praised 
for repaying the £375,000 he received.

Mr Keating, the former director of 
archive content, learned his pay-off exceeded his contractual 
entitlement only when the NAO branded it ‘seriously deficient’, and 
immediately sent back a cheque.

The BBC paid £369million to departing staff members over eight years, including £60million to senior managers.

However, Lord Hall, the BBC’s new director general, has now introduced a £150,000 cap on severance payments.
