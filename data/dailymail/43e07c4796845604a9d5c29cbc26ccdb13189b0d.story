The family of the Sydney hairdresser who was allegedly stabbed to death by her ex-husband plan to take her body back to her homeland of Iran to be laid to rest.

Leila Alavi had reportedly agreed to meet Mokthar Hosseiniamrae on Saturday when she was discovered dead inside her car at a car park at Auburn Shopping Village in Sydney's west.

Allegedly killed with a pair of scissors, Hosseiniamrae, 33, who Ms Alavi had taken out an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order against, has been charged with murder.

The 26 year-old's devastated parents were expected to fly to Sydney this week to transport their daughter's body home to the country she left as a refugee in 2011 to move to Australia for a better life.

Ms Alavi's brother-in-law, Fred Poliena, said her parents, who were in extreme shock about their daughter's horrific death, plan to hold her funeral in Iran.

'Her parents were the most important thing in her life,' he told The Daily Telegraph. 

'I think it's better for her parents so they can be close to her while they suffer through this tragedy.'

Ms Alavi had reportedly lived in fear at a women’s refuge before she was killed and had taken out an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order against her estranged husband after years of turmoil.

This comes as startling figures reveal that almost half of all apprehended violence orders were breached in NSW in the 12 months previous to September last year.

Of the 26,491 orders issued as many as 11,788 were breached, the newspaper reported.

Police painted a picture of a history of domestic violence inflicted on Ms Alavi as her ex, Mokthar Hosseiniamrae, stood accused of murder during a hearing at Parramatta Local Court on Sunday.

'It is alleged that the accused has physically assaulted his wife in the past, with incidents not reported,' police said while arguing he should be denied bail.  

Police allege Hosseiniamraei stabbed Ms Alavi in an underground carpark at Auburn Shopping Village in Sydney's west on Saturday shortly after she went to talk to him.

One of Ms Alavi's friends at her workplace, Benjamin Hair Studio, revealed it was not unusual for Ms Alavi to meet her ex Mokthar Hosseiniamraei. ‘I’ve seen him over 10,000 times,’ Meneske Cinar told the Daily Telegraph.  

He was arrested shortly before 7pm at a property on James Street in Guildford West after the death of the apprentice hairdresser and is due to appear at Burwood Local Court on April 1.

Her body was found by a distressed colleague inside her Holden Astra shortly after 10am with initial examination suggesting Ms Alavi had suffered a knife wound to the throat. 

Hosseiniamraei was taken to Auburn Police Station for questioning and was charged with murder and breaching an AVO early on Sunday morning.

Shortly before 10am on Saturday, Flemington police were called to the Auburn shopping centre in Sydney where  Ms Alavi was found stabbed inside a vehicle

Court documents opposing Hosseiniamraei’s bail depicted a turbulent relationship between the pair who reportedly married in 2011 in Sydney.

‘The accused has shown a propensity for anger and being unable to control that anger,’ police alleged. 

A NSW police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia could not comment further on the incident as the homicide investigation is underway.

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Ms Alavi's distressed co-worker said she didn't know 'how or why this happened.'

The former couple's wedding photographer told the Sydney Morning Herald Ms Alavi had been trying to help Hosseiniamraei despite a volatile relationship. 

'She tried to manage the relationship and help him out because she did love him and really wanted him to get clean. She still cared for him at the end too,' Fredo Monty said.

Mr Monty's photographs from their wedding show the pair happy and in love as the posed in front of Sydney's famous harbour.

Ms Alavi had moved to Australia from Iran and was studying at Granville TAFE for her future.

'She couldn’t live in Iran and she came to Australia to live her life, to be a successful person but she’s dead right now,' sister Jacklin Poliena told Nine News.

According to the Telegraph, cafe owner Zeynep Zabinoglu was one of the last to see Ms Alavi alive on Saturday.

'We both got here at 8am and parked our cars… I said good morning to her and she said good morning and then we both went to work,' she said.

'Then about an hour and a half later I heard the other girls who work there screaming. I called the police and told them to get here as fast as they can.

'It was too late,' she said.

Mr Zabinoglu, who is a local barista in the area told 9News: 'It's such a shame. You can tell she wouldn't hurt a soul in her life. If you need anything she'll make sure she's there for you.

'It's really, really upsetting to lose somebody like that - a young person, such a young soul.'
