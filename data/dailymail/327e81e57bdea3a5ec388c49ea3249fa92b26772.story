It looks like something from another era - and in many ways it is.

But this overgrown telephone box, covered both inside and out by ivy, is still fully functioning in Street, Somerset.

However, BT are set to decommission the telephone box because it has only been used four times in the last year.

It is not known whether its lack of use is down to the increasing popularity of mobile phones... or whether people aren't even able to see it's there!

Ring ring the changes: The public can just about gain access to the telephone box but it will soon be out of use

Hidden from view: Despite its shabby state, the telephone is actually in full working order

It has become so overgrown with trees, 
shrubs and ivy from a nearby hedge that it is hard to tell it is there 
at all in a sign of our times when more people than ever are using 
mobile phones.

By March this year, Ofcom said 92 per cent of the UK's adult population had a mobile phone - more than 46 million people.

In 2006 it was pictured in a similar state and now six years later it will be decommissioned because it underused, somewhat unsurprisingly.

A  BT spokesman said: ‘This is a little used payphone, which is due to be removed in the next few months. 

‘Only four calls have been made from this payphone in the past year.

It's for Yew: Both the inside and the outside of the neglected telephone box has been overcome by plantlife

How it should look: This telephone box on the island of Housay, in the Shetland Islands, has been well looked after despite it remote location

‘There have been no complaints from the public but we will of course tidy up the kiosk now we are aware of the problem.’

The
 iconic red telephone boxes were once a familiar sight on the streets of
 the United Kingdom, painted red to make them easily identifiable to the
 public.

Despite a reduction in their numbers in recent years, red boxes can still be seen in many places and in current or former British colonies around the world.

Some kiosks have even been sold off and converted to be used as shower cubicles in private homes.

In Kingston upon Thames a number of old K6 boxes have been utilised to form a work of art resembling a row of fallen dominoes.

In 2009 a K6 in the village of Westbury-sub-Mendip in Somerset was converted into a library or book exchange replacing the services of the mobile library which no longer visits the village.
