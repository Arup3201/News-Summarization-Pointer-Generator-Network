Some people have a force-field of terrible breath or feet that smell so repellent that insoles are never enough to dampen the disgusting odour.

And while people have their own unique scent, it is a surprisingly select cocktail of chemicals that create the distinctive and disgusting aromas associated with bad body odour.

An British graduate chemist and secondary school teacher has created an infographic to pinpoint the compounds and the particular smells they bring to underarm odours and even flatulence.

Brace yourself: A British graduate chemist and secondary school teacher has created an infographic (pictured) to pinpoint the chemical compounds and the particular smells they bring to underarm odours and even flatulence

Bad breath is the result of three main chemical compounds: methanethiol, hydrogen sulphide and dimethyl sulphide.

They produce a blend of odours including sulphur, garlic, rotting eggs and cabbage.

Flatulence is a blend of the same three chemical compounds responsible for bad breath.

Feet really do smell cheesy as the result of three main chemical compounds: methanethiol, propanoic acid and isovaleric acid.

The result is a horrible odour reminscient of sulphur, garlic, sourness and cheese.

Underarm odour is largely the product of another three compounds: (E)-3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid, (S)-3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol and 3-hydroxy-3-methylhexanoic acid.

Most people's sweaty armpits smell of a combination of goat, onion and cumin.

The anonymous blogger started publishing his infographics four months ago after creating some posters to brighten up his classroom and hopes to explain the chemistry of everyday substances and problems on his Compound Interest blog, where he also sells his creations.

It is well known that in most cases, halitosis, or bad breath, is the product of bacteria in the mouth, which produce waste products and chemical compounds.

But many people don’t know that the main offenders are volatile sulphur compounds, including hydrogen sulphide, which smells of rotten eggs, methanethiol, which resembles gone-off cabbage and dimethyl sulphide, which is a little bit like garlic.

At low levels, these compounds aren’t detected by the human nose, but it doesn’t take a great deal for them to become noticeable and put off a partner.

Certain foods and drinks can also make the problem worse – or at least more distinctive. As well as the three primary offenders, the compound called 3-mercapto-3-methylbutylformate is produced when someone drinks coffee and gives their breath a nasty tang.

Garlic breath is attributed to allyl methyl sulphide - a product of the breakdown of garlic - and eating meat and fish can make your breath smell like a rotting corpse.

What a whiff: Feet really do smell cheesy as the result of three main chemical compounds: methanethiol, propanoic acid and isovaleric acid. The result is a horrible odour reminscient of sulphur, garlic, sourness and cheese

This is because the bacteria that produce volatile sulphur compounds thrive on proteins and produce extra compounds such as cadaverine and putrescine, which smell of rotting human bodies and fish.

In a rather disgusting study, it was ‘proved’ that sulphur-containing organic compounds are produced in the digestive system and are to blame for flatulence.

Hydrogen sulphide, methanethiol and dimethyl sulphide – all of which contribute to bad breath – are again the main offenders.

Experts used a combination of gas chromatography and ‘smell experts’ to identify the compounds.

A total of 16 participants were fed 0.44lbs (200g) of pinto beans and samples of their gas were collected and handed over to three judges with the dubious expertise of being able to identify the different sulphur-containing gases.

As well as rating the odours from mild to offensive, they discovered that women typically emit a higher concentration of hydrogen sulphide, which smells of rotten eggs, and consequently their gassy emissions are more pungent than men’s.

However, they also noted that men generate ‘a greater volume of gas per passage’ so it seems both sexes have undesirable abilities.

There are approximately one million bacteria per square centimetre on your underarms, which can smell if left unwashed.

Time to upgrade the deodorant? Underarm odour is largely the product of another three compounds: (E)-3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid, (S)-3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol and 3-hydroxy-3-methylhexanoic acid. Most people's sweaty armpits smell of a combination of goat (pictured left), onion (right) and cumin, if stale and unwashed

Eew! There are approximately one million bacteria per centimetre squared on your underarms, which can smell of goat and onion (illustrated) if left unwashed

There are two organic compounds responsible for undesirable odours that don’t contain sulphur. One is 3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid - which is recognisable as that nasty sweaty smell and has been described by experts as ‘goat-like’ - and 3-hydroxy-3-methylhexanoic acid that makes a cumin-like smell.

Another compound called 3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol along with other sulphurous compounds provides an onion-like note.

Like with underarms, the presence of sweat provides a helpful environment for bacteria to thrive and produce noxious compounds.

Two of the main contributors to ‘cheesy’ feet are propanoic acid and isovaleric acid.

Propanoic acid is described as ‘pungent, sour and rancid’, while the cheesy smell comes from isovaleric acid, which is also said to smell ‘rancid and fermented’. Isovaleric acid is produced as the result of bacteria also found in certain pungent cheeses.

Battle of the sexes? Experts discovered that women typically emit a higher concentration of hydrogen sulphide, which smells of rotten eggs, and consequently  produce more pungent flatulence than men
