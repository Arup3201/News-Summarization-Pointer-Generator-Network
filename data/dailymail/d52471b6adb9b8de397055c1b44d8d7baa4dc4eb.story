A former New York City
 television reporter has been sentenced to 26 years in prison after 
being found guilty on charges, including the sexual assault of a 
4-year-old girl at his home in New Jersey.

At 
his sentencing Friday, former Fox 5 reporter Charles Leaf seemed to have
 aged and lost weight since his trial months ago.

Leaf staunchly 
maintained his innocence as he spoke for more than 20 minutes in state 
Superior Court in Hackensack with the aid of hand-written notes.

Wearing
 an orange prison jumpsuit and his hands in cuffs, Leaf said that 
abusing a child was an 'abhorrent' and 'reprehensible' act, perpetrated 
by 'the worst kind of criminal.'

'I however, 
your honor, am not one of them,' he told the court, sometimes tearing 
up. 'I am innocent, 100 per cent innocent, innocent of all eight counts.'

Leaf,
 of Wyckoff, was arrested in 2010 and was found guilty in February by a 
jury on eight counts including sexual assault, child endangerment and 
possession of child pornography.

During the 
trial, the now 8-year-old girl withdrew her accusations, and Leaf's 
father-in-law testified that he, not Leaf, had viewed porn on Leaf's 
computer.

Leaf
 consulted a handwritten note as he continued speaking, noting that he 
had passed both a polygraph exam and a psychosexual evaluation, The Record reported.

Family man: Leaf said he would appeal his conviction and fight for his family

'I have led a life of honor, integrity, courage and commitment,' he said.

He added that he had served his country as a Marin and held the powerful accountable as an investigative journalist.

After sentencing, Assistant 
Prosecutor Kenneth Ralph said the punishment imposed by Judge James 
Guida was fair.

Ralph had recommended a 28-year sentence.

Leaf's attorney, Brian Neary, said his client plans to appeal the 'flawed and baffling' verdict.

'We firmly believe that the jury got this wrong,' Neary said. 'Mr. Leaf maintains his innocence and will continue to fight.'

Leaf's wife, Monica, declined to speak to reporters.

Throughout the trial, she stood by his side.

Leaf himself, however, promised to go on fighting and appeal the conviction.

'I swear an oath to my children...that this fight is not over.'
