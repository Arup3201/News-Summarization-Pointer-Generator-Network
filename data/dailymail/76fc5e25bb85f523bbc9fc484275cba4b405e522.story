A failed businessman was found guilty yesterday of shooting his parents dead four months after trying to drown them in a staged car crash.

Fraudster Stephen Seddon blasted them with a sawn-off shotgun after learning he was the sole heir to their £230,000 estate.

The luxury car salesman, who had massive debts, also planned to kill his disabled nephew, but by a stroke of luck he was not at home.

Manchester Crown Court heard the 
46-year-old had first tried to kill Robert, 68, and Patricia, 65, by 
driving a hired BMW into a canal with them strapped in the back.

Seddon smashed his way out of the car and was later hailed a hero for ‘rescuing’ his parents and nephew.

Yesterday police admitted that ‘with 
hindsight’ they should have spotted that the canal incident was staged 
and ‘handled it differently’.

Seddon had previously enjoyed a luxury
lifestyle, owning a Porsche 911 Carrera, an Audi convertible and a 
chauffeur-driven Bentley.

It was claimed his firm had an annual 
turnover of £5million and at one time he had £2million in his bank 
account. But his lifestyle came ‘crumbling down’ when he was convicted 
of fraud in 2000 and he became financially reliant on his parents.

Seddon, who rubbed shoulders with 
high-flying businessmen and footballers, killed his ‘quiet, unassuming’ 
parents despite them giving him £40,000 and buying him a home.

The court heard Bob Seddon, 68, suspected that a earlier car crash into a canal was an attempt by his son 
to kill him and his wife Patricia, 65

Prosecuting, Peter Wright QC, said: ‘He was spending money as fast as he received it. He was in his parents’ debt and deeply so.

'He was heavily reliant on their generosity. He was the sole beneficiary of their estate and he knew it.’

On the day of his parents’ deaths, unemployed Seddon had just £5 in his bank account and had been applying to payday lenders.

After the shootings, the defendant 
planted the gun in his father’s lap to make it look like a 
murder-suicide at their home in Sale,   Manchester.

Shocking: Seddon had previously tried to murder his father, Robert, 68, and mother Patricia, 65, by driving into a canal with them strapped in the back seats in a fake road accident

Health problems: Patricia Seddon was left unconscious after the crash, and was rushed to a nearby hospital

But ballistics reports were ‘entirely 
inconsistent’ with this version of events. It was also revealed that 
Seddon’s nephew, Daniel, 17, had narrowly escaped death.

Police found the shotgun was loaded 
and it was alleged that Seddon had been expecting three people at the 
house. Luckily Daniel was in respite care at the time.

The day before the murders, Robert Seddon had warned his GP that his son was trying to kill him.

He had grown suspicious when he noticed his son had watched a programme on how to escape from a sinking car on his Sky Plus box.

Following the killings, police launched an internal inquiry into the canal crash.

Yesterday, Detective Chief Inspector 
Denise Worth said: ‘Hindsight is a wonderful thing, and yes, looking 
back now it could have been handled differently.

‘But at the time he came out of it as
a hero and it was treated like a tragic accident, but it was only after
the murders that we went back and looked at it in detail that we 
realised things didn’t fit.’ 

Seddon’s first murder attempt took place on Mother’s Day last year at the Bridgewater canal in Timperley, Cheshire.

Daniel managed to free himself and Seddon was seen on the roof of the car kicking the windows in and shouting for help.

He told police he had suffered a heart
attack but hospital tests indicated he hadn’t. He also suggested the 
car had hit a brick, but no debris was found.

Four months later the father-of-three
of Seaham, County Durham, acquired a stolen shotgun from a contact in 
Darlington before driving to his parents’ house.

Police later found both victims had been blasted at close range.

Seddon, who denied murder and attempted murder, will be sentenced today.

Stephen Seddon has become one of the very rare number of people whose greed drove him to the ultimate crime - not only murder but the murder of his own parents.

For Seddon money was his 'whole world' and when he got it, he spent it fast.

Even the lives of his mother and father were just an obstacle to overcome to get his grasping hands on cash.

Detective Superintendent Denise Worth, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'This job is probably one that is very, very difficult for anybody to contemplate.

'That anybody could kill their parents, to plan it, and to do it for money is indescribable. I cannot imagine that there are many people in the world that could do it.'

Seddon was leaching off his parents' modest wealth for years before he murdered them.In one of the last acts of his life, his father paid his son's £60 speeding fine.

His parents had already bought Seddon's home in Seaham, Co Durham to keep a roof over his family's heads.

Seddon was supposed to pay his father rent - but it was not clear if money ever changed hands.

Seddon grew up in Timperley, a Manchester suburb. His father worked for British Airways and the family were 'comfortable'.

He began offending at the age of just 13, appearing before youth courts for offences of burglary, handling and theft.

Further convictions followed as an adult for taking vehicles without consent and he was jailed at Bolton Crown Court in 1989 for a series of offences including obtaining goods by deception, theft and making off without payment.

He met his wife Nicola, an ex-model who is from the Sunderland area, in a lap dancing bar in Manchester 17 years ago and they moved to the North East.

His offending continued and he developed a taste for the high life.

He worked mainly in sales and in the late '90s set up a firm, European Business Support, providing grants to small businesses.

The firm charged businesses £295 on the promise it would help secure European funding.

His firm grew to an annual turnover of £5 million and he had £2 million in his bank account at one point.

Ms Worth said: 'Seddon has had quite a lavish life in some respects.

'He has always had a fair amount of money. He has always had fairly well-paid jobs, so he has not had any financial difficulties.

'When he had his own company he had a really, really lavish lifestyle.'

He bought a Bentley Turbo, hired a chauffeur and enjoyed jetting around the world, staying first class - again it was all just show.

There were no European grants - he simply kept the cash.

In 2000 Seddon pleaded guilty at Teeside Crown Court to fraudulent trading and was jailed for a year.

In the weeks before killing his parents he was desperate for money, applying for high-interest, instant- access loans from various finance firms.

On the day he carried out the killing he had just £5.45 in his bank account.
