A medieval book that once belonged to King Henry VIII will go on public display for the first time today.

The lavishly illustrated Aberdeen Bestiary, created in England around 1200 and first documented in the Royal Library at Westminster Palace in 1542, is part of a new exhibition at Aberdeen University.

Bestiaries were illustrated books of animals, some real and some mythological, used to provide Christian moral messages.

Detailed: The lavishly illustrated medieval book used animals, both mythological and real, as religious symbols to convey moral messages

The Bestiary, which has been in the possession of Aberdeen University for almost four centuries, includes animals such as deer and the panther (centre)

Experts are still unsure whether the Bestiary was commissioned for a royal client or seized during King Henry VIII's reign from a dissolved monastic library

As well as lions, tigers and apes, the Bestiary references a number of mythological animals:

Bonnacon Mythical animal from Asia, that has curled horns and emits burning dung. The legend may be based on a type of bison in reality.

Monoceros Single-horned animal such as a unicorn

Crocotta Mythical dog-wolf of India or Ethiopia

Parandrus Ox-sized, long-haired, animals with antlers and cloven hooves, that could change their shape at will.

Yale Beast from European mythology, often goat-like four-legged creature with large horns that it can swivel in any direction.

Satyr Creature from Greek mythology that were half man, half goat

They were popular in the 12th and 13th centuries but few were as lavishly produced as the Aberdeen manuscript, which has been in the care of the university for almost four centuries.

It is unclear whether the Bestiary was commissioned for a royal client or seized during King Henry’s reign from a dissolved monastic library.

Siobhan Convery, head of special collections at the university, said: ‘The Aberdeen Bestiary is a remarkable resource which offers a fascinating insight into the mediaeval mindset.

‘We will be turning the pages of the original Bestiary each week so we hope people will return time and time again to discover something new.’

Professor Jane Geddes, academic advisor to the exhibition, said: ‘The Bestiary is like a medieval encyclopaedia and was written to appeal to the general public and to teach children how to read.

The Bestiary has been described as a 'medieval encyclopaedia' and a 'remarkable resource'

Insight: Although Bestiaries were widely produced, none were so lavishly illustrated as the Aberdeen edition

The Aberdeen Bestiary includes sections on birds, including the mythical Phoenix (pictured)

‘It was specifically designed to draw
 you in and that appeal has stood the test of time. It is not about 
nature but about moral messages and there is a story behind each 
beautiful illustration.

'The Aberdeen Bestiary is one of the most lavish ever produced but it was never fully completed and so the edges of the pages were not finished and tidied up.

‘This means that the tiny notes from those who created it still remain in the margins, revealing more to us about the method of production than most other surviving medieval books.’

The Aberdeen Bestiary is also extremely rare in having a ‘twin’, as it is widely believed to have been created by the same monks, in the same monastic scriptorium, as the Ashmole Bestiary, held at the Bodleian Library in Oxford. Professor Geddes said: ‘By comparing the two, we can access an unparalleled amount of information about how the scribes and artists actually worked.’

The Bestiary first came to Aberdeen in 1625 when it was bequeathed to the University’s Marischal College by Thomas Reid, a former regent of the college and the founder of the first public reference library in Scotland.

Reid, who served as Latin secretary to King James VI, is said to have been given the book by his friend Patrick Young, son of the Royal Librarian to the King.

The Gilded Beasts exhibition will be open until August 18.
