The number of people with diabetes in Britain has reached an all-time high – with over four million people now living with the disease.

Currently, 3.2million have been diagnosed with diabetes – over 90 per cent with the obesity-related Type 2 – but over 850,000 more are unaware they have the deadly condition. 

However, this is only set to get worse as the country fails to tackle the ‘epidemic’ rates of obesity, the NHS warns.

Record: The number of people with diabetes in Britain has reached an all-time high - at more than four million

The Department of Health predicts that the proportion of people with diabetes will jump from 7.3 per cent of the population in 2012 to 8.8 per cent by 2030.

Now, people aged between 40 and 74 in England are being urged to have an NHS Health Check to spot the first signs of the disease.

The checks could also highlight certain diets or lifestyles that may lead to diabetes, or spot other illnesses, such as heart disease or kidney failure.

Since the programme was launched in 2009, the Department of Health estimates it has prevented 1,600 heart attacks and strokes, at least 650 premature deaths and more than 4,000 new cases of diabetes each year.

Early detection of diabetes allows patients to respond by managing the illness to stop it from getting worse.

But campaigners argue prevention is better than a cure - and efforts must be made to stop people developing the disease in the first place.

Last year, more than 1.3 million English patients people took an NHS Health Check.

Public Health England (PHE) is trying to raise awareness of the programme to mark Diabetes UK’s annual Diabetes Week.

Patient Rashmikant Joshi was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes after his GP carried out the check.

He said: 'Through the NHS Health Check I received an early diagnosis and treatment. I was encouraged to take control of my own health and now no longer need insulin, thanks to a healthy diet and regular exercise.

'Communities that may be at a higher risk of certain conditions, like diabetes, may not be aware of the benefits a simple NHS Health Check can have.'

Professor Kevin Fenton, the PHE's director of health and wellbeing, said: 'With Type 2 diabetes becoming more common, the NHS Health Check presents an opportunity for individuals to take steps earlier, such as weight control, to prevent or even reverse diabetes in its early stages.

'It is important that those eligible take up the offer of an NHS Health Check so their risk of serious, but potentially avoidable conditions, can be assessed, leading to early intervention.

'PHE is committed to increasing physical activity and reducing physical inactivity across England and these aims are prominent in a number of public health campaigns.'

Barbara Young, Diabetes UK Chief Executive, said there are currently 630,000 people living with undiagnosed Type 2 diabetes.

'The sooner we can identify them, the sooner they can start getting the support and healthcare they need to manage the condition,' she said.

'At the moment many people who could benefit from the NHS Health Check are missing out on the opportunity, we would urge anyone aged 40-74 to get one. It could be one of the best things you ever do for your health.'

But Neville Rigby of the International Obesity Forum said: 'It’s important that everyone wakes up to the real risk of diet-related diseases like diabetes and heart disease, not just for the overweight and obese who are at greater risk.

'We won’t solve this growing epidemic of non-communicable diseases until we have tackled the fundamental problem of providing affordable healthy food and break the junk food habit generations have grown up with.

'The urgent challenge is not simply to tell the over 40s to have a health check to get treatment for the rest of their lives, but most importantly to deal with prevention early in life.

'There is a lag between weight gain increasing the risk for type 2 diabetes, the disease taking effect and then being diagnosed and treated.

'There is a real price to pay for having failed over so many years to address this.

'We know that researchers found remarkable differences in the number of adults under 80 already dying from diabetes - 50 per cent more in London than in some others parts of the country.

'And the 3.2 million diagnosed with type 2 diabetes is just the tip of the iceberg given Britain continues to have an unhealthy diet and little is really being done to introduce effective measures to combat this.'
