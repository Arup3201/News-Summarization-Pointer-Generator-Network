Mother-of-five Zoe Rhiannon Aspland, 30, from Yeovil, Somerset, died after driving the wrong way along the M5

A woman who died after driving her car the wrong way up a motorway and colliding with four vehicles was a mother-of-five, police said today.

Zoe Rhiannon Aspland, 30, from Yeovil, Somerset died after driving her Ford Ka north on the southbound carriageway of the M5 during the early hours of Saturday morning.

Her parents Stephen and Karen Aspland paid tribute to their daughter today.

In a statement released through Avon and Somerset Police, they said: 'Zoe... was a loving mother to her five children and will be sorely missed by her brother Lee and sisters Alice and Laura.

'As a family we would appeal for privacy as we grieve for the loss of Zoe and we would ask any witnesses to the incident to come forward.'

Avon and Somerset Police said Miss Aspland drove the wrong way up the motorway from Weston-super-Mare towards Clevedon at 12.30am yesterday.

'It was involved in separate collisions with two vehicles and was left stationary when it was hit by two more vehicles,' a force spokesman said.

Miss Aspland died at the scene, he added.

The M5 is a key tourist route in and out of the West Country which is expected to be busy this Bank Holiday weekend.

It was closed while emergency services dealt with the incident and police officers investigated the crash, but reopened by 7.30am.

Hours after Ms Aspland died, a 38-year-old man was killed when a car crashed near Hayle, in Cornwall.

He was pronounced dead at the scene following the single-vehicle accident at 3am, while his female passenger was taken to the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro with minor injuries, a Devon and Cornwall police spokesman said.

The motorway, a busy tourist route, was closed until 7.30am following the fatal crash
