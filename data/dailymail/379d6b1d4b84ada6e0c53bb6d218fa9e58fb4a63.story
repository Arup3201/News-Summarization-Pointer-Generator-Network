Victim: Frances Bloomfield's body was discovered in a ditch near Rockford, Illinois, bound with ligatures and wrapped in plastic on September 22, 1996

The husband of a woman who was strangled to death and dumped in a ditch 16 years ago has been arrested thanks to DNA evidence, it emerged today.

John Bloomfield, 73, was arrested at his home in St Paul, Minnesota, on Tuesday charged with first-degree murder in the death of wife Frances Bloomfield.

Iowa City police said DNA on material used to bind the body was consistent with his DNA.

Bloomfield - a researcher at the 
University of Iowa - returned from a business trip to France at 6.30am 
on September 22, 1997, and reported that his wife was missing.

He said there 
were several areas in the home spotted and pooled with blood.

Hours later, her body was discovered in a 
ditch 177 miles away in Illinois, bound with ligatures and wrapped in plastic.

Medical examiners said she had probably been dead two days. There was no evidence of sexual assault.

Officials ruled cause of death as 
strangulation by ligature - someone used a cord or similar device to 
strangle Bloomfield after she'd fought a bloody battle for her life.

Authorities discovered her missing vehicle two months later in New 
Jersey.

Neighbors told officials they last saw Bloomfield outside her home on Saturday afternoon between 5:30 and 6pm.

Marital home: John Bloomfield returned from a business trip to France at 6.30am on September 22 and reported that his wife was missing and there were several areas in the home spotted and pooled with blood

Crime scene: A search warrant of the home turned up seven separate blood stains from different areas, including a bedroom, hallway and garage

John Bloomfield was a suspect in the murder but was never charged with anything.

Detectives poured through evidence taken from the car and the home.

He had filed expense vouchers with the University of Iowa for his trip to France and said he rented a car from Chicago airport on September 21 and drove to his home.

One year after Bloomfield’s murder, investigators said the case remained open but there was a possibility it may never be solved, Iowa Cold Case reports.

'At this time the statistics are against us in solving the case, but that doesn’t mean we will stop investigating,' Iowa City Police Department investigations commander Dan Sellers told the Daily Iowan in 1998.

'[John Bloomfield] is a suspect, but so is everyone else that we have spoken with in the past year. He has not been ruled out, but he hasn’t been charged with anything, either.'
