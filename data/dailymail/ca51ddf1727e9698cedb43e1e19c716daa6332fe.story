If you have always wanted your wedding to resemble a Hollywood movie, now is your chance - if you have the cash to spare.

For a cool $1million, bride and grooms tying the knot at the luxury La Valencia Hotel in California will be able to have entertainment producers and stylists involved in their big day.

The ocean-front property, where Madonna has stayed, is offering the high-end Ultimate Wedding Package, which includes accommodation for 125 guests, as well as top-notch chefs and couture bridal gown designers.

La Valencia Hotel in La Jolla, California has a custom wedding package, which starts at $1m

Entertainment producers, stylists, photographers and videographers will be on hand to help plan the nuptials

The wedding party will be able to have the hotel to themselves, as it closes its doors to other guests throughout their chosen weekend.

And for that amount, the  112-room property will be transformed into a Mediterranean-style villa.

As well as a dinner celebration on board a private yacht, the $1m price tag also includes housekeepers, waiters and concierge as well as lounges and restaurants at the disposal of the bridal party.

The bride and groom will also have be able to use the on-site villa as their wedding night accommodation, and guests can take advantage of yoga classes should they want. 

There will also be Hollywood hair and makeup artists, musicians, florists, photographers and videographers helping to plan the luxe nuptials.

Private business jets, luxury car services and yachts for the bridal party and guest transportation also come as part of the package.  

Rita Moore, La Valencia's Director of Sales and Marketing, said: 'This ultra-customised wedding experience is designed for the couple who want effortless luxury.

'The carefully selected design team will work closely with the bride and groom to actually create a brand for your wedding.'
