Millions of book lovers have  made a pilgrimage to the  Parsonage Museum in Haworth, known around the world as the home of the Bronte sisters.

Now, the owner of a modest three-bedroom cottage six miles away aims to rival it  as the ‘true birthplace’ of the famous literary family.

The Grade II listed cottage in the West Yorkshire village of Thornton was built in 1802.

Literary heritage: The three-bedroom cottage in the West Yorkshire village of Thornton was once home to the Bronte family

Patrick Bronte, his wife Maria and their first two children, Maria and Elizabeth, moved there in 1815 and it is where Charlotte, Emily, Anne and  Branwell were all delivered in front of the fireplace in 1816, 1818, 1820 and 1817 respectively.

But five years after making it their home, the family moved to the Parsonage at nearby Haworth – which has claimed the spotlight in the Bronte story ever since.

The cottage was shut up for years following the failure of a birthplace museum on the tourist trail.It was let as private rented accommodation until it came back on the market last year.

The historical home had been rented 
as bedsits to tenants in search of cheap accommodation but the plaques 
commemorating the births of the four gifted children outside the faded 
front door were barely noticed.

After the last tenants packed their bags the absentee landlord put the property on the market last year.

The Bronte birthplace trust was formed by local villagers to save the property and turn it back into a museum again.

But this scheme failed after Bradford Council decided it could not afford to buy the property.

Amid fears it would be turned back into flats, businessman Mark de Luca and his wife Michelle spotted the near-derelict property believing it to be an unpolished tourism gem.

He renovated the home which was suffering from damp and flooding and has turned it into a deli where visitors can look round the Bronte’s private quarters.

The cafe is due to open up in May following an extensive renovation.

Among other features, visitors will be able to inspect the very hearth where all three sisters were born.

It also boasts the writing desk built
 into the structure where Patrick Haworth wrote his first sermon - about
 the Battle of Waterloo.

The new owners, both 29, sold their cottage in the village to buy the Bronte home. They snapped it up as a repossession for £120,000 and then spent another £30,000 doing it up.

The couple already had a track record, having converted a Grade II listed building around the corner into a hair salon.

But it was cheap because the 100 year old timber windows were rotten, the roof was leaking, and the wallpaper was falling off the walls -which were riddled with rising damp.

The old scullery at the rear of the property had flooded through the back door with waste from the overflowing drains.

Mr de Luca, a former quantity surveyor, said: ‘It was so damp and humid. The drains were overflowing with years of dirt and debris.’

‘The property has been mistreated over the years and I wanted to bring tourists back to the village,’ he said.

‘It is a very important property for England and we wanted to reclaim the history and restore the place to its former glory.’

The second bedroom where the younger Brontes slept has become the drawing room, though it still has the built-in wardrobe used by the children.

The third bedroom used by the Bronte children’s nurse serves as a study while the downstairs scullery has become their private kitchen.

The rest of the downstairs rooms, including the drawing room with the famous fireplace, have been laid out as a delicatessen and coffee shop with room for 35 people due to open next month.

A counter and open kitchen serving cakes, sandwiches, and pastries has been created in one of the front extensions built in the 1900s as a butcher’s shop.

The couple hope the trendy décor will attract of a new generation of Bronte fans who previously may have regarded the sisters’ writings as a touch highbrow.

Mr de Luca added: ‘We want to make the Brontes cool and trendy. The Bronte Society meetings and events at Haworth seem to attract mainly older people.

‘The original idea of a museum is great - but you do not really get to sit there and enjoy reading a Bronte book or a newspaper.’

Birthplace Trust Chairman Steve Stanworth said: ‘I am delighted. It will  once again be somewhere that Bronte fans can see the actual place the literary giants were brought into the world.

‘It could have been turned into flats - and that would have been a real shame. But Mark spotted a unique selling point for a coffee house.

‘Thornton village needs the recognition as the first stop on any pilgrimage and we hope this helps the regeneration of the village.’

Bronte Society Chairman Sally McDonald said: ‘The birthplace in Thornton is hugely important in the Bronte story.

‘In the bicentenary year of 2016 the world’s attention will turn to all places linked with Charlotte Bronte.

‘Some years ago former Bronte Society member, Barbara Whitehead, bought and tried to restore the house but sadly it proved just too big a project.

‘It is a pity the Birthplace Trust’s hopes of turning the house into a museum were pipped at the post but it wasn’t to be and it is heartening to hear the new owners are keen to sympathetically retain the history.’

Patrick Bronte wrote of his time in Thornton: ‘My happiest days were spent there.

‘This is where the family was complete: father, mother and children, and where they had kind friends.’ In Haworth, he said, he felt like ‘a stranger in a strange land’.
