Hard-pressed British families have seen 
the cost of their weekly food shop rise by twice the European average during 
the past five years, according to new figures.

Prices here have increased by 37 per cent since 2007 - and could go up by another 40 per cent over the next decade.

This compares to food price rises of just 12 per cent in France and 13 per cent in Germany during the same period.

Costs: The price of the average weekly food shop for people in Britain has risen twice as fast as in other European countries

Figures compiled by the Department 
for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) show the rise in food 
prices since 2007 in Britain is far higher than in other EU nations.

And costs are expected to continue rising 
at twice the rate of inflation, piling more financial strain on already 
stretched budgets.

According
 to a report in The Daily Telegraph, the annual food bill for the average 
family will rise to £4,000 by 2022, from £2,766 last year.

Average
 weekly shopping bills are now around £77, according to the consumer 
magazine, Which? - an increase of more than £5.60 on last year.

The rise in food prices worldwide has been blamed on an expanding population and increasing commodity costs, while wheat prices have been particularly badly hit due to bad weather this year in big producers such as the US and Russia which has damaged crops.

Britain has been particularly vulnerable to price rises because it imports 40 per cent of the food it consumes, the newspaper reports.

Forecast: Food costs are expected to continue going up by around four per cent a year in Britain for the next decade

Transportation costs have also risen fast - making it more expensive to import food from other parts of the world.

Research by the shopping and price comparison website Mysupermarket.co.uk, shows the price of staple foods has risen fast during the past 12 months.

The price of 500g of minced beef has, for example, has increase by a fifth, from £2.20 to £2.80, since last September.

The rising cost of food is now rated as one of the top concerns by British consumers - as prices continue to rise faster than wages, according to the Telegraph.

Food prices in Britain are among the fastest increasing in the developed world.

Supermarkets claim they are trying to keep costs down for shoppers where possible.

A
 spokesman for Tesco, the UK’s biggest supermarket, told the newspaper 
that the firm was 'committed to helping keep the cost of food shopping 
down. '

Despite
 the recent price rises, food in Britain is nevertheless, still cheaper overall
 than in other European nations, according to DEFRA, due in part to the 
competitiveness of British supermarkets.
