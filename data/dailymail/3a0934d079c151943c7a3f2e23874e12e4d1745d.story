If you've ever needed proof that cutting down on the chocolate biscuits is a quick way to lose pounds, then this is it. 

Teenager Emma Day, 18, has lost nearly half of her body weight simply by giving up her favourite sweet treats, and now weighs a svelte 8 stone 11lbs.

What's more, her diet success has paid off in more ways than one, as the pretty blonde now has modelling agencies knocking at her door.

Addiction: Emma used to munch her way through piles of chocolate biscuits every single day

Change: Pretty Emma has shed almost half of her body weight by ditching the biscuits

Emma’s biscuit bingeing started in primary school and by the time she left, she weighed more than 12 stone.

By 13, she was tipping the scales at 15 stone and had become the target of cruel jibes from school bullies.

Emma, who hails from Dewsbury and is training as a make-up artist, said: 'I was one of the first girls to hit puberty and it was horrible. I would just come home and comfort eat a whole packet of chocolate digestives.

'I also drank about seven hot chocolates every day. Some nights I would go to my grandma’s for supper and then come home and have a second one with my mum. I hid the junk food I ate from my mum.'

Bullies, who harassed her every day and once even physically attacked her with a tennis racket, only made the biscuit binges worse.

'It was just awful and for about two years it was really bad,' says Emma. 'I was always off school and would pretend I was ill.

'I remember one time I ate raw chicken to make myself sick so I didn’t have to go in to school.'

Eventually Emma's mother intervened and helped her to swap biscuits for salad. The pounds started to drop off almost immediately.

'I started eating fruit and vegetables instead of biscuits and snacks,' says Emma. 'I used to have sugary cereal or biscuits for breakfast but now I have fat free yoghurt and fruit I feel so much healthier.'

A part time job as a waitress also helped to speed up the weight loss thanks to the physical effort required to wait on tables and carry piles of plates.

'I’m always running around and on my feet,' says Emma. 'There’s no way I could have done that before.

No thanks! Emma's new look diet includes plenty of healthy salads, lots of broccoli and two Rich Tea biscuits

'I can now run around without getting tired and I am so much more toned. Talking to people at work has given me my confidence back too.

'I was told every day that I was a fat nerd. I only had one friend and absolutely no confidence. I was afraid to talk to people and kept myself to myself, but now I just don’t hold back.

'I feel so much healthier now. Before I wouldn’t even wear trousers because I looked awful in them.

'Now I can wear anything I want and I have so much confidence. My mum calls me a chatterbox because I will talk to anyone.'

So much confidence has Emma gained, she even felt able to enter Miss Teen Queen UK and, much to her delight, has made it through to the second heat.

She said: 'My friends made me sign up to the pageant and I totally forgot about it until I got a letter through my door.

'I think deep down every girl would love to be a model, but I just never ever thought I could do it. Now I am being told to sign up to modelling agencies. I can’t really believe it.'
