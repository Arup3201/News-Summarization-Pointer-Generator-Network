The owners of a Texas cliff-side mansion that was burned down on Friday over safety concerns examined the startling ruins in person on Sunday.

Robert and Denise Webb saw the fire in a live broadcast online from another home they own in Florida, WFAA reported.

Robert Webb called the remnants of their Lake Whitney home 'absolutely mind-boggling' when speaking to the station.

'When the first torch went off, (Denise) lost it,' he said.

Charred 
debris fell from the Webbs' home fell 75 feet into the lake on Friday after fire 
crews set the $700,000 retreat ablaze rather than wait for it to crumble
 into the water as the land faltered around it.

It
 took less than an hour for the fire to level the home. Flames consumed 
exterior walls after crews spread bales of hay and fuel to ignite flames
 throughout the expansive home.

'I told Denise coming down I felt like we were going to the funeral home because we're coming to see the remains,' Robert also told WFAA. 'And even though you see it on television and you know it's happening when you come here, it's really staggering.'

Denise Webb expressed similar sentiments to the station.

'Every room that we lived in, every room that we shared, we just watched it go up in smoke,' she said. 'It's just terrible.'

The couple decided to burn their home after authorities condemned it and deemed it unsafe. They said destroying the house was better than waiting for it to topple into
 Lake Whitney. The cost of removing mounds of debris from the lake could
 prove prohibitive.

The ground
 around the home cracked and became unstable in recent months. Then a 
few days ago, part of the land gave way beneath the 4,000-square-foot 
home, leaving pieces of the house dangling off the side of a cliff.

Destruction: The Webbs, who decided to burn the home over safety concerns, initially hoped to leave it to their grandchildren

Spectators in dozens of boats witnessed the demolition from a safe distance. Live television coverage shared the view of the spiraling black smoke coming from the gated resort community.

The Webbs purchased the home in 2012, but a few weeks ago were forced to remove their personal items and relocate. They expressed shock and sadness at losing their lake house.

The Webbs, who also have a home along Florida's Miami Beach, told WTSP-TV on Thursday that the deterioration of their property was hard to watch. That report said the couple's home was worth around a million dollars.

'You know, that's my life there that we're watching fall off,' Robert Webb said the day before the demolition.

The couple was told the property was 'perfectly stable' - 'and so we bought it in good faith,' Webb said.

The house, built in 2007, was to have been left to his grandchildren, he said.

'It's really tough, that house was special and I don't even know why it was so special but it was special to me,' Denise Webb said.
