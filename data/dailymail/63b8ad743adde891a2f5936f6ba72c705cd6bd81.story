Atletico boss Diego Simeone is excited at the prospect of the Frenchman joining the club.

'He’s a brilliant player,' said Simeone , speaking to reporters before Atletico’s friendly against San Jose Earthquakes. 'He is very quick and can give us a lot of options in attack.

'However, it’s also true that a lot of other players have been talked about as possibly coming [to Atletico], and we could make two teams out of all of them.'

Spurs and Chelsea had been linked with the Frenchman, who represented his nation during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, but it appears the La Liga champions have won the race for his signature.

Griezmann has been capped nine times for Les Bleus and has netted on three occasions.

The winger has made 201 appearances during five years at Sociedad, scoring an impressive 52 times.

Sociedad have already lost goalkeeper Claudio Bravo to Barcelona for £10m this summer but the La Liga club are now braced for the exit of another of their prized assets.
