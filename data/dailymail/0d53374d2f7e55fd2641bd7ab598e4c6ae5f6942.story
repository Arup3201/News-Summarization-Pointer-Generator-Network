Kentucky Fried Chicken has taken hot dogs to a whole new level.

A meal which is traditionally served as a sausage in a sliced bun is now being offered inside a fillet of fried chicken breast at select KFC stores.

The fast food chain's Double Down Dog is also topped with cheese, honey mustard and relish dressing.

It is only available to 50 customers at selected stores in the Philippines over a two-day period, ending today. 

However some took to social media to express their disappointment as the hot dog failed to satisfy their taste buds.

On the day of its launch, yesterday, KFC announced that its 'outrageously meaty KFC Double Down Dog have been sold out in all participating stores'.

While the new addition as been described as the 'meatiest original recipe chicken fillet with a tender juicy chick'n cheese hot dog topped with honey mustard and relish dressing', it wasn't so appetising when customers made their purchase. 

'It's very disappointing that there's no more truth in advertising. Look at this double down dog that I got. NOT WORTH IT,' one unimpressed customer wrote after posting a photo of his hot dog on KFC's Facebook page.

Others embraced the new addition and were excited to try it out.

'We must try this,' a customer wrote as she tagged a friend.

'Damn I want,' another wrote.

 It appears Filipino customers were eager to take a bite out of the meaty treat

Sadly for American KFC enthusiasts, the fast-food giant says there are no plans to add the fatty fried treat to menus in US stores.

The hot dog entombed in fried chicken calls to mind KFC's infamous Double Down sandwich, which was introduced in select locations in the US back in 2010.   

The gut-busting offering featured bacon and two kinds of gooey cheese squeezed between two pieces of chicken fillets.
