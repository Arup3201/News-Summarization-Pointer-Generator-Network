Pilot Mark Crampton explained that shortly after the plane took off, he heard a large bang and a clunk while retracting the nose gear.

He said he turned to his co-pilot and said: 'That doesn't sound all that good.'

Trouble: The faulty front wheel can be seen dangling in front of the plane

Terrifying: The plane hit the ground in an upright position before dipping forward due to the faulty wheel

Scary: The pilot that the sounds of the nose dragging along the runaway was 'pretty scary' and the pair jumped out the plane as soon as it ground to a halt

Desperate: The pair jumped out the plane as soon as they could, aware of problems which could cause the plane to catch on fire

Brave: Pilot Mark Crampton said his training kicked in when he realised he would have to carry out an emergency landing

Mr Crampton, who has been a pilot for about 18 months, realised they were in trouble when their control panel indicated there was something wrong with their landing gear.

After three failed attempts they tried to deploy the wheel manually but it still did not lock into place.

When ground observers confirmed the nose wheel had not been properly released the pair realised they would have to carry out an emergency landing.

'Even though I was extremely nervous it's amazing how the training kicks in,' explained Mr  Crampton.

The pair knew they had to come in as slow as possible and make sure they could keep the nose up as long as they could. 

They ran through the procedure in the log book between them and then came into land.

Mr Crampton said that the sounds of the nose dragging along the runaway were 'pretty scary.'

The pair jumped out the plane as soon as it ground to a halt. 

'When it happens your greatest fear is fire,' Mr Crampton explained.

But he insisted the experience has not put him off taking to the skies.
