Children are receiving ‘inadequate and meagre’ music classes despite tens of millions of pounds being lavished on improving lessons, according to the schools watchdog.

Ofsted said pupils are ‘poorly taught’ with many never introduced to classical music and primary pupils assumed ‘with no good reason’ to be unready to learn musical theory.

School leaders were also found to be over-optimistic about the quality of teaching provided by staff.The government is spending £171 million on a three-year programme to raising standards following a damning review of music education in England in 2011.

Must improve: The report emphasised the need for schools to drive up the quality of their music provision and to introduce young children to the value of classical music

This is spearheaded by 123 ‘music hubs’ - local authority music services or groups of professional music organisations which organise lessons.

Ofsted inspected 31 hubs and found 22 had made ‘little difference’.

Music curriculums still lack ‘depth and vigour’, it said, and services overlapped with those already provided by schools. None were able to show how they were providing good value for money.

The report said: ‘We must expect greater impact on music education for all pupils in schools.’ Recommendations included Arts Council England, which allocates the funding, to take ‘rapid action’ to improve the situation.

The organisation’s chairman is former television executive Sir Peter Bazalgette, who has been blamed for dumbing down television after helping launch programmes including Big Brother and Fame Academy.

A spokesman said: ‘The report identifies a number of issues regarding the quality of music teaching in schools.

‘We agree schools need to do more to drive up the quality of their music provision and to listen to and take advantage of the expertise which is being made available to them through hubs.’

Michael Cladingbowl, director of schools policy at Ofsted, said: ‘Music is a demanding academic discipline, developed through exciting practical musical activity.

‘However, the vast majority of the schools visited shied away from teaching pupils about fundamental aspects of music as they thought it too difficult.

‘All children, not just the privileged few, should enjoy a good music education.

‘Music hubs were created with this very aim, so it is concerning that the hubs visited for this survey could not show how their work in schools achieves this or how they provide value for money.’
