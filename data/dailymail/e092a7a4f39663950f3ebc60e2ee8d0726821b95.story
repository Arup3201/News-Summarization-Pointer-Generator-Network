She may be 62, but Jane Seymour proved that age is just a number as she posed in a range of glamorous wedding gowns in a new shoot.

The actress gave models half her age a run for their money as she showcased designs by Erika Suess at Hotel Sacher in Baden near Vienna, Austria.

In April this year, Jane announced she and her director husband James Keach - parents to twin sons Johnny and Kristopher, 17 - were splitting after 20 years of marriage.

So is Jane - who has been married four times - in the market for husband number five?

The star certainly looked stunning in an array of evening gowns and stylish hats by the Austrian bridal designer.

The two-time Golden Globe winner - 
born Joyce Frankenberg - showed off her toned physique in a long red gown and a selection of summery whites.

Writing on her website, designer Erika 
says of her designs: 'I design for women of all ages.'

'My dresses are special because of my feminine cuts and colours and the use of high-quality fabrics such as lace, satin, cashmere and wool.

'To me, great customer service means being able to order a dress in any colour and fabric.

'The most important attribute of an elegant dress is the cut and the waistline.'

In choosing mature Jane as her model, is Erika perhaps hoping to tap into the growing market for those getting married the second - or even fifth - time around? If so, it could be a shrewd move, since divorce among the over-50s has soared 
by 30 per cent in the past 20 years.

More than 11,500 people over 60 
were divorced in 2009, and by 2010 — the most recent year for which 
figures are available — the number of these so-called ‘silver 
separators’ had risen to 14,564.

Recently single Jane has been keeping busy of late. An avid painter, last week she showcased her watercolors at the 
Wentworth Gallery Las Olas in Ft. Lauderdale.

She's also been out and about in recent months promoting her latest movie - An American Girl: Saige Paints The Sky Friday - about a talented young artist Saige (played by Sidney Fullmer) who sets out to save her school’s art and music programs.

Seymour plays Saige's grandmother, a well-known artist and horsewoman, who inspires her granddaughter.

Jane will next be seen in the comedy Austenland - due out August 16 - with Keri Russell.

She will also appear in the film Jake Squared and a two-part British TV movie, Unknown Heart.

Youthful Jane doesn't look very different to the 22-year-old who shot to fame when she starred with Roger Moore in the 1973 James Bond film, Live And Let Die.

Ms Seymour has admitted having breast implants and a 'minor' eyelift, and says she has considered liposuction. But on the evidence of these pictures, it doesn't look like she needs any help at all from the surgeon.
