A freshman football player for the University of Kentucky has been charged with first-degree rape.

Defensive end Lloyd Tubman was arrested and charged Tuesday, before he was then suspended indefinitely by the university.

Coach Mark Stoops announced the suspension and said in a statement he was 'very concerned about the allegations and all parties involved.' 

Stoops appeared shaken when discussing the situation after Tuesday's practice, saying, 'Anytime somebody in our program has an issue like this, it's obviously a major concern. We just feel for all parties involved and we'll let the legal process go through its course.'

The Lexington-Fayette County jail's website said Tubman was being held on a first-degree rape charge.

Charged: University of Kentucky football player Lloyd Tubman was charged with first-degree rape

Alleged rape: The university has said that Tubman was arrested by campus police following an incident last week at a residence hall on campus

The university said in a release that the 6-foot-5, 225-pound Tubman was arrested by campus police following an incident last week at a residence hall on campus. 

The release also stated the 19-year-old, who played at Louisville Seneca High School, 'is subject to discipline under the University’s Code of Student Conduct.

'Because of legal and student privacy regulations, University officials cannot provide comment to Tubman’s specific participation in the student conduct process.' 

Stoops learned about the incident last Thursday and said 'It was a tough time as you could imagine. ... I'm not so much concerned for myself in that situation. But really, it was very difficult to meet with Lloyd and meet with his mother and to see somebody in your program hurting. I feel for all parties.

'It's obviously not a situation that anybody wants to be in.'

Tubman has not played this season and was likely to be redshirted

Multiple incidents: Tubman's arrest and suspension comes less than a week after four Wildcats players were charged with second degree disorderly conduct for their involvement in air pistol shots being fired near a campus residence hall

The charges brought against Tubman stem from a university crime bulletin published last Thursday, Chief of Police Joe Monroe told Kentucky Kernel.

The bulletin said 'On Thursday, October 2, 2014 at approximately 4:15 p.m., it was reported to the University of Kentucky Police that at approximately 11:45 a.m. that day, a female student was sexually assaulted by a male student in a residence hall on campus. The alleged suspect is known to the victim and the crime is currently being investigated.'   

The state's uniform citation only said that Tubman was arrested at 2:08 p.m. and taken to the Fayette County Detention Center without incident.

Tubman has not played this season and was likely to be redshirted.

His arrest and suspension comes less than a week after Wildcats freshmen teammates Stanley Williams, Dorian Baker, Drew Barker and Tymere Dubose were charged with second degree disorderly conduct for their involvement in air pistol shots being fired near a campus residence hall on Sept. 28. No one was injured, but the campus was locked down for several hours while police investigated.

Police found the air pistol the next day, along with three BB guns. Guns are banned on Kentucky's campus.

Stoops suspended the four players for last week's game against South Carolina for violating team rules but said Monday that they will be reinstated for Saturday's game against Louisiana-Monroe. The players face an Oct. 28 appearance in Fayette District Court and possible internal discipline for their roles in the incident. 

Stoops also said Tuesday 'We constantly talk to [the football team] about things,' according to The Courier-Journal. 'Last week when we had the other issue, I addressed all issues, including this -- including sexual assault and any kind of assault and all those things. I addressed it at that time again. And we'll continue to do the best we can and educate these guys and help these guys and, again, coach them and teach them and mentor them, and we'll be there for them when they need us to.'
