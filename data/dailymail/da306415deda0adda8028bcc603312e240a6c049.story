On trial: Anne Lakey, pictured leaving court yesterday, is accused of a string of sex offences against a teenage boy in the 1980s

A man who claims he was seduced as a 13-year-old boy by a teacher today told a jury that he now believed it was 'disgusting and wrong'.

Anne Lakey, 54, an acclaimed headteacher, was friendly with the alleged victim and would invite him to visit her alone while her husband was at work, the court heard.

Lakey, who transformed her school into one of the best in the country, is accused of grooming the boy from the 
age of 13 or 14 for a year-long period in the late 1980s.

The alleged victim today told the jury
 that he had sex with Lakey because 
it was 'what all lads in their early teens want to do.'

But that looking back at the situation he could see that it was 'disgusting and wrong'.

Lakey, who he called a 'disgusting sexual monster' is appearing at Durham Crown Court, accused of a string of ‘predatory’ sexual offences, including 
sex with a boy under 16.

She is accused of having sex with him while he was in his school uniform and exposing herself to him.

The
 complainant claimed that one day when he was in her family home she started flirting with him and asked him to play a game of 'dare'
 with her. It led to her baring her breasts and 
allowing him to touch them.

Later she had sex with the boy, still dressed in his school 
uniform, and continued a sexual relationship with him regularly after 
that, it was alleged.

On other occasions he would watch her bathe and they would have oral sex, he told the jury.

The complainant today told the court: 'I knew we shouldn’t be doing it.

'I understood I was under age and she was married, but I didn’t think it was wrong like I do now.

'I was not looking at it like an adult. At the time I knew we shouldn’t have been doing it but it was exciting as well.'

The offences were said to have occurred when Lakey was a teacher in her late 20s, but the alleged victim was not a pupil. She denies the charges.

Ann Lakey arrived at court on Tuesday hand-in-hand with an unknown man. The offences she is accused of were said to have occurred when Lakey was a teacher in her late 20s, but the alleged victim was not a pupil

Asked why he had done it, the complainant said: 'Because I was a lad in his early teens, that’s what lads in their early teens want to do,' he said.

'Now looking at it as an adult, I think it is disgusting and wrong.

'That’s why I am here.'

When he told Lakey that he did not want to see her any more, he claimed she tried to keep him in her room and told him he must not tell anyone about what had been going on.

Feeling trapped, he grabbed something and threw it at her before running away, he told the jury.

Asked how the abuse when he was 13 and 14 had affected his later life, he said he regretted not mixing more with girls his own age during that time.

The complainant came forward in 2012 
after seeing a piece of literature which said that Lakey was committed 
to giving young people the best chance in life. 

In
 a letter, he called the defendant a ‘disgusting sexual monster’. Lakey,
 from Stanley, County  Durham, was described as an ‘inspiring leader’ by
 the Chief Inspector of Education after improving GCSE pass rates at her
 struggling school by focusing on vocational education. 

But she was suspended from her position as chief executive of the Durham Federation of Schools last December after the allegations came to light.

The complainant's mother today gave evidence via videolink saying that 'his face crumpled' when he told her in 2000 what had happened.

'He told me she had taken his cherry off him when he was 13.

'I asked if he had ever done anything about it, had he gone to the police?

'He just said no, he had been too embarrassed to talk to anybody about it.'

Lakey denies all nine charges against her, which include two counts of inciting a boy to commit an act of gross indecency, two of gross indecency, and five counts of indecent assault.

The offences are said to have happened between April 1988 and May 1989.

Lakey became the head teacher at Deerness Valley Comprehensive in 2001 which later became one of two schools to form the Durham Federation of Schools.

Under Lakey’s leadership the school boasted GCSE pass rates of 80 per cent in 2013 against 26 per cent the year before, and it was named the country’s most improved secondary school last year.

Lakey, who was appointed to the national leaders of education, a body charged with transforming struggling schools, entered teaching in 1982. The trial continues.
