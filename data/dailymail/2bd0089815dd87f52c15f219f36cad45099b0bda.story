An eight-year-old boy has tragically died just two days before Christmas after being injured on a building site in Sydney’s south-west.

On Tuesday at 1.30pm New South Wales Police were called to a construction site on George Road at Leppington, following reports a young boy had been knocked unconscious.

Initial reports suggest the boy was playing on a pile of concrete slabs, when some of the slabs slipped and fell on top of him.
