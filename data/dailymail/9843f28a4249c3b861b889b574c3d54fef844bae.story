Former US child prodigy Freddy Adu has finally found a new club after signing for Finnish side Kuopion Palloseura (KuPS) - the 11th team of his short career.

The 25-year-old was tipped to become one of the world's best players after breaking through as a teenager with DC United, but has struggled to live up to expectations at a succession of clubs ever decreasing in stature.

The former USA international recently spent short-lived spells with Bahia in Brazil and Serbian side Jagodina (plus trials with Blackpool, AZ Alkmaar and Norwegian side Stabaek) and even turned to nightclub promoting before penning a one-year-deal with KuPS.

Adu appears to be philosophical about the move after quoting former Prime Minister Winston Churchill on his Twitter account, saying: 'Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts!' 

KuPS finished seventh in the 2014 Veikkausliiga and will be hoping that the American can help them challenge the likes of HJK and SJK in the coming season. 

The modest club have pulled off  a transfer coup by attracting Adu who will join compatriot Stephen McCarthy in the squad. 

Once labelled as 'the next Pele' during the early stages of his career, the Ghanian-born forward has played just 59 minutes of competitive football since the end of the 2012 MLS season.

In 2006 he moved to Real Salt Lake, before Portuguese giants Benfica signed him a year later. He dabbled in Ligue 1 after failing to hold down a first-team spot in Lisbon, joining Monaco on loan for the 2008-09 season. 

The next season he was back in Portugal with Belenenses, before he moved to Greek side Aris in January 2010.

Thirteen months after that he joined Turkey's Caykur Rizespor, but that spell was short-lived and he returned to the US half a year later. 

Adu finally appeared to be settled after spending two years at MLS side Philadelphia Union, only to suddenly join Bahia in April 2013.

He was released by Bahia in November and had trials with Blackpool in February and in June former US boss Bob Bradley offered him a chance at Norwegian side Stabaek.

Adu failed to impress Bradley enough to secure a long-term deal, which led to a trial with Eredivisie side AZ Alkmaar before his move to Serbia. 

The 25-year-old is now at his 11th club, having played for sides including Monaco and Benfica (above)
