A dictrict council wants to ban apostrophes from street signs to ‘reduce potential confusion’.

Unsurprisingly, Mid Devon officials were unable to explain what trouble could arise from correct use of punctuation.

And they admitted that the the apostrophe purge has been pursued unofficially for years.

Banned: Existing apostrophes such as Blundell's Avenue in Devon will not be changed but no new signs will be permitted to use such punctuation

Official guidance: Mid Devon Council said in future all road signs should avoid using punctuation entirely

Too difficult: A local proofreader said it was as if punctuation is being 'erased' from public consciousness

Mid Devon District Council has issued
new guidance for street naming which says 'all punctuation, including 
apostrophes, shall be avoided.'

The authority argues the policy will 'eliminate' any potential confusion in the event of an emergency.

New streets have not contained apostrophes for many years but the guidance is now being made official, it added.

Residents and plain English campaigners have criticised the decision but the council said apostrophes could only be found in three existing street names in the district.

Proofreader Mary de Vere Taylor said abandoning apostrophes was a 'backward step'

It added that Beck's Square and 
Blundell's Avenue both in Tiverton and St George's Well in Cullompton 
were all named 'many, many years ago'.

Andrew Lacey, from Mid Devon District Council, said there was no national guidance that stops apostrophes being used.

But proofreader Mary de Vere Taylor from Ashburton hit out at the decision.

'It's almost as though somebody with a giant eraser is literally trying to erase punctuation from our consciousness,' she said.

'To me there's something terribly British and terribly reassuring about well-written and well-punctuated writing.

'Some
may say I should get a life and get out more but if I got out more and 
saw place names with no apostrophes where there should be I shudder to 
think how I'd react.'

Ms de Vere Taylor said while she 
accepted language had to evolve in her opinion the council's decision 
was a backward step.

Steve Jenner from the Plain English 
Campaign said punctuation including the apostrophe was one of the basic 
rules of language and he described the council's decision as 
nonsensical.

Local residents reacted furiously to the move.

Commenting on Facebook Beckey Boyles said: 'If the Council stop using it correctly, people are NEVER going to learn!

'Is it because the people they employ are not sure where it goes either?'

Leni
McCormick said: 'Finally! I've been going around for years complaining 
to my husband about abysmal punctuation, and English isn't even my first
language.'

Rob Harris 
posted: 'I think the decision shows that the council is confused about 
the proper use of English. Beckey is right. Use it or lose it.'

Tricky: Incorrect use of apostrophes is a common occurrence but does that mean they should be banned?

Confusing? In future all Devon road signs in the district will have to be more like this

Baffling: Residents slammed Mid Devon Council for issuing the bizarre guidance

Extinct: Campaigners say the apostrophe is one of the basic rules of the English language

Stephanie Harrison posted: 'Bad grammar, spelling and punctuation really annoy me. It is just laziness.

'I
can remember when at school in the 60's that it was a major part of our
English education. Our teachers would mark our books in red pen with 
the corrections in the margins.

'The thing you dreaded the most was the 'see me' comment at the end!'

Paddy Paddison posted: 'It irritates me no end when people use apostrophes like glitter to be scattered randomly around.'

A statement from Mid Devon Council
said: 'Our proposed policy on street naming and numbering covers a 
whole host of practical issues, many of which are aimed at reducing 
potential confusion over street names.'
