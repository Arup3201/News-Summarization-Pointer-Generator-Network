Reigning US Open Champion Marin Cilic is already looking ahead to Wimbledon and eyeing his next Grand Slam title.

‘Wimbledon is the first tournament I’ve got my eye on,’ said Cilic, who lost to Juan Monaco on Saturday night in Indian Wells in his first match of the year after a shoulder injury. ‘I’m going to try to peak my form for Wimbledon time.’

The world No 10 believes that the grass court credentials of his coach Goran Ivanisevic, who won the title in 2001, can help him conquer SW19.

‘I believe having Goran in my corner, who has been known in history as one of the best grass court players ever, is a big plus. Wimbledon is a big target for me.

‘Even last year we approached the grass court tournaments differently. When I started to play last year I straight away felt better than before and I feel its going to be similar this year.’

Cilic had an excellent run at Wimbledon 2014, knocking out Tomas Berdych in straight sets before going down in five to Novak Djokovic and that run, coupled with his maiden slam title in Flushing Meadows in September, leaves him feeling confident that he can have a successful trip to London.

‘I think I have a good chance of winning Wimbledon,’ said the 26-year-old. ‘In 2014 I played really well over there and lost to eventual champion Djokovic in a pretty close match.

‘I felt the best on the grass ever last year and that’s what’s giving the most confidence. And, with the experience of winning the US Open, I can carry that on into grand slam tournaments.’

The 6ft 6in Croat was speaking after his nomination for breakthrough sportsperson of the year at the 2015 Laureus World Sports Awards. He credits Ivanisevic for his superb 2014 season.

‘Goran was extremely hard working as a player and he still is,’ said Cilic. ‘We tried to push my game to be more aggressive, to play my own game rather than thinking about the tactics of the other guys.

‘He helped me a lot with my serve and in all areas he was a huge help. Goran knows tennis.’

Ivanisevic is part of the growing army of ‘supercoaches’ – well-known former players who are helping to guide a new generation. The trend was started by Andy Murray hiring Ivan Lendl, and Cilic believes that big-name players make the best coaches.

‘They know the game,’ he said. ‘They’ve been through many of the same situations in their own careers. Goran teaches me to not do the same mistakes he was doing during his career. It’s huge to have someone who has won a grand slam in your corner.’

He has matched his coach in winning a grand slam. He has matched his Laureus nomination (Ivanisevic won the 2002 comeback award). Now Cilic is ready to equal his mentor’s most famous achievement by winning the Wimbledon title.
