A seemingly healthy young woman was left paralysed down one side of her body after suffering a major stroke - aged just 20.

Elizabeth Ashmore, complained of a headache after Sunday dinner and went to bed and woke the following morning with no feeling down the left side of her body.

When she temporarily lost her memory and the ability to even tell the time, doctors declared she had suffered a major stroke.

Shock: Elizabeth Ashmore, 20, ended up paralysed down her left side after suffering a stroke

The news was a huge shock to the fit and active student, who doesn't smoke and regularly attended Zumba classes.

Elizabeth,
 from Canterbury, Kent, was eventually diagnosed with a middle cerebral 
artery infarct, which is a blockage of a blood vessel in the brain.

It could have been brought on by kidney condition nephritic syndrome, which can cause blood clotting.

Three months later Elizabeth, a graphic design student, has returned home after intensive physiotherapy in Kent and Canterbury Hospital.

She uses a wheelchair and stick to get around and still has no feeling in her left arm, hand ankle and toes, but is learning how to cope only using her 'good' side.

Elizabeth said: 'I'd had a normal day at home on the Sunday but after dinner I had a massive headache I couldn’t get rid of. I went to bed, but couldn’t stop shaking.

Support: Elizabeth with her boyfriend, Luke. She was so weak when he came to visit her in hospital that she could only give him the 'thumbs up' sign

'My mum tried to stand me up, but I collapsed. I didn’t know what was happening. My mouth was drooping and I couldn’t move my left arm at all or lift my leg.

'When I woke up, I was really upset. I didn’t understand where I was and then it hit me that I was paralysed.

Currently, almost a third of strokes occur in people under the age of 65, and this figure is set to rise, according to the Stroke Association.

Strokes occur when blood flow to the brain is blocked, either through a clot or a bleed.

Anything that raises blood pressure increases this risk, so smoking, alcohol consumption and obesity can all increase your risk of stroke., whatever your age.

The contraceptive pill can also increase the risk of stroke, particularly if there’s a history of high blood pressure within the family.

Pregnancy is another potential risk factor for stroke in young women.

'My boyfriend came to visit and all I could do was a thumbs up sign. I was just staring at him. I also lost my memory - I couldn’t even tell the time, which was scary.'

She added: 'It was upsetting because doctors didn’t know if I’d be the same person I was before.

'It was scary and really emotional at first. It’s made me realise how much people take things for granted. I watch people using both hands and it upsets me. You don’t think you’ll lose something so big, so young.

'Everything has changed. I’m starting to come to terms with the fact my hand might not ever work again.

'It’s a case of getting life back to how it was before, but in a different way.'

Elizabeth now realises a strange episode when her left arm went numb a month earlier could have been a warning sign - and is campaigning for more awareness of stroke in young people.

On January 5 - a month before the stroke - she went to A&E with a numb arm but doctors said it was just a trapped nerve.

She said: “At the time, I joked "imagine if it stopped working". I never expected it to actually happen.

'The doctors didn’t investigate whether it could be a stroke because of my age.

Rehabilitation: Three months later Elizabeth uses a wheelchair and stick to get around and still has no feeling in her left arm, hand ankle and toes. She is learning how to cope only using her 'good' side

'We think it might have been a warning sign and if doctors had spotted it they could have given me blood thinning drugs.

'I’m not angry with the doctors - there just needs to be much more awareness that strokes can happy to 20 year-olds.'

A stroke is a medical emergency - it's essential to recognise the early warning signs and call 999 immediately. 

A mini-stroke (also known as TIA or transient ischaemic attack) is a sign you may be at major risk of having a stroke. It’s symptoms are the same as a stroke, except that they last for a short amount of time and no longer than 24 hours.

There is a very high risk of going on to have a major stroke within the first few days following a mini-stroke, so it’s important to get the right treatment fast, says the Stroke Association.

The FAST test can help identify the signs of a mini-stroke:

* FACIAL weakness: Can the person smile? Has their mouth or eye drooped?* ARM weakness: Can the person raise both arms?* SPEECH problems: Can they speak clearly and understand what you say?*TIME to call 999

Elizabeth hopes to go back to her studies at the University for the Creative Arts in Surrey and as a part-time sales assistant job at Fenwick.

'The nurses were brilliant and the physios and occupational therapists were amazing.

'I was lucky my leg started moving in week three. I never thought I’d have to learn to stand up and walk again.'

Around 75 per cent of strokes affect the over 65s, but Elizabeth is keen to raise awareness of the risk to younger people.

She added: 'I want people to know the symptoms and get checked out if they show signs of any.

'Don’t assume that just because you’re young, it won’t happen.

'It’s scary to think I nearly died but you just have to get on with it. You learn to not take things for granted. I’m stronger than I was before.'

Elizabeth’s boyfriend Luke Elliott, 21, and friend Alexandra Podd, 21, are running 30km in June to raise money for the StrokeAssociation.
