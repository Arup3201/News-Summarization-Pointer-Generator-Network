A British ISIS fighter has blown himself up in a car on a suicide mission in Iraq using 1800kg of explosives to kill a number of the country's security force soldiers.

Abu Hajar al-Britani reportedly carried out the attack in the strategic Iraqi town of Baiji today and ISIS claims the Brit also destroyed a significant number of tanks and artillery equipment. 

A photo was released by ISIS' media branch for the province of Salahuddin, showing Abu Hajar al-Britani in full military uniform.

His face is covered with a black balaclava and his gloved left hand is raised, with his index finger extended to the sky to signify his belief in Allah being the one true God. 

In his right hand, Abu Hajar carries a machine gun, its wooden barrel appearing polished in the photo. 

A gold decorated copy of the Qu'ran can be seen tucked into the pocket of his rucksack strap - the holy book is positioned right next to his heart.

There have been no further details released about the real identity of the deceased British fighter.

Abu Hajar is the second British ISIS extremist to blow himself up in a suicide bomb mission in Baiji.

Earlier this month, it was announced that Kabir Ahmed had  carried out a suicide bombing mission for ISIS - killing eight Iraqi police officers.

Known as Abu Sumayah al-Britani, the 32-year-old from Derby was a father of-two who had previously told BBC Newsnight that he was desperate to join the 'waiting list' to become a suicide bomber. 

Ahmed had been jailed in the UK for gay hate crimes after handing out leaflets calling for the execution of homosexuals.

Abdul Waheed Majid, aka the 'Crawley bomber', was the first British fighter to carry out a suicide operation in Syria.

Known as Suleiman al-Britani, the 41-year-old was seen calmly chatting to several fighters before his death in a video released by the Al-Qaeda affiliated group, Jabhat an-Nusra. 

The video showed Majid wearing a white robe with a black headband, inscribed with the motto of Jabhat an-Nusra. 

He admits he cannot even speak Arabic but seems calm prior to carrying out the suicide mission. It goes on to show Majid climbing into a heavily armoured lorry, packed with explosives. 

The father-of-three is later filmed driving the lorry into the gates of Aleppo jail, detonating the vehicle on impact. 

According to the international Centre for the study of Radicalisation and Conflict Violence, Abu Hajar, who carried out today's attack, is the 29th British fighter to die fighting in Syria and Iraq.
