Liverpool assistant manager Colin Pascoe has backed Lazar Markovic to come good ahead of his expected recall to the team for Tuesday's Capital One Cup clash against Swansea.

Serbian winger Markovic, who signed for the Reds from Benfica during the summer in a £20m deal, has not come off the bench in three of Liverpool's past four games.

But Pascoe believes Markovic will eventually show his star quality at Anfield.

Pascoe told the Liverpool Echo: 'Lazar will definitely come good, he’s a quality player.

'That’s why we brought him in here. He’s working hard. He stays behind after training to do extra shooting.

'That’s the kind of guy he is. He wants to do well and he’s a winner.

'We’ve had a lot of new players coming in and it takes time for them to all gel together. But they are all quality players and will fit in fine.

'It is just that time where they have to bed in. They are training and working hard. Just give them time and then you’ll see the best of them.'
