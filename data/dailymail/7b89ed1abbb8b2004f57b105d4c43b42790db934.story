As the gears start to turn on his wife's potential 2016 campaign for the White House,  Bill Clinton seems more interested in new baby granddaughter Charlotte Clinton-Mezvinsky than more politics.

The former president was more than happy to dish about life as a grandfather during an appearance on the Ellen Show on Tuesday, talking in detail about how it's been 'a hoot' to watch baby Charlotte grow in the last six weeks.

'It's amazing,' Clinton said. 'Hillary and I only have one child and she's quite wonderful, but it's been a long time since she's been that age.'

'It's just a joyful experience. I love it. I'm so happy,' he added.

'Their vision starts to get out, and she almost doesn't have time to laugh, she never cries, she just soaks things up,' he revealed of the latest addition to the family.

'I think if my mind worked like that it would be so great.' 

Ellen DeGeneres also took the opportunity to present the new grandfather with a couple of gifts for the baby.

The former president dissolved into laughter as Ellen offered him the choice of two very different babygros - one with 'My Grandma's Running For President in 2016' on it and the other emblazoned with 'My Grandma's A Stay-At-Home Granny'.

Clinton diplomatically suggested the one about new grandmother Hilary running for president 'would be best for the country' but added 'it's not a decision for me to make'.

He said the other babygro that would make Hilary a 'Stay-At-Home Granny'  would make his wife 'happy as a clam'.

'So, keep them both and give her the right one when she decides,' Clinton.

When pushed further on whether Hilary might be planning another trip to the White House, Clinton responded: ''I do want to say something seriously, but I don't know what Hillary's going to do. It's true. If I did, I wouldn't tell you, but I don't know.

Proud grandfather: Bill Clinton appeared on the Ellen Show on Tuesday and spent a good deal of the interview raving about his new life as a grandfather 

Baby Charlotte turned six weeks old on Friday but the former president admits that he and Hillary have not had a lot of time to dote on their new grandchild, but hope to do so soon.

'We haven't had much spoiling time,' Clinton said. 

The Clintons have been travelling the US in recent weeks, campaigning for democratic candidates in the midterm elections. 

However, nearly all of the Senate candidates Hillary campaigned for lost, a bad omen for her presidential chances.

Charlotte's debut: Clinton says he and wife Hillary haven't had much time to spoil their new grandchild yet. For the past few months, the Clintons have been travelling across the country to campaign for Democratic candidates running in the midterm elections 

Clinton went on to recall the day daughter Chelsea gave birth and riding in the car to the hospital with Hillary to see Charlotte for the first time, and the hilarious conversation they had about their role as grandparents.

'I told Hillary as we were going to the hospital: 'Now, we have to remember that this is not our child and we have to show up when we're invited and do what we're asked'.'' 

Chelsea Clinton appears to be adjusting to motherhood well too. On Monday, she flaunted her surprisingly trim post-baby body on the red carpet at the Glamour Women of the Year awards, escorted by husband Marc Mezvinsky. 

'It's just a joyful experience. I love it. I'm so happy,' Clinton said of grandfatherhood
