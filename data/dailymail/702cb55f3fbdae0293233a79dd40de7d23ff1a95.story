A 12-year-old Florida girl suffered burns to 71 per cent of her body after a can of gasoline exploded next to her.

Heather Tyer and her family were having a pit fire at their Polk County home last week when the explosion happened. The gas was being used to set logs on fire.  

Polk County Fire Lieutenant Charles Irving told 10 News: 'Burn patients are so difficult from one minute to the next. you know, they can seem fine, and then things can go terribly wrong very quickly.'

Heather Tyer suffered burns to 71 per cent of her body after a can of gasoline exploded next to her at the Florida's 21-year-old's family home last week 

Mr Irving was first on the scene, and even returned to get Heather's mother Amy on to the emergency helicopter to accompany her daughter to Tampa General. 

Heather is said to be recovering well from the ordeal, and her local community are now fundraising to help with her treatment. 

Heather's aunt Amanda Tyler told local media that her niece was 'strong' and 'doing just fine'.  

Another one of Heather's relatives, Janice Anderson, said seeing how many volunteers had turned out to help her, 'gives me goosebumps'.

So far more than $26,000 has been raised to help pay for Heather's hospital treatment and rehabilitation 

In less than a week, more than $26,000 has been raised to help Heather through fundraising website gofundme.

Mr Irving said the accident was a reminder for people to be careful when using gasoline which was 'not one of the better fuels to use'.

He said: 'There has to be water on the site at all times, and someone attending to the fire at all times. And if we do that, tragedies like this can be avoided.'
