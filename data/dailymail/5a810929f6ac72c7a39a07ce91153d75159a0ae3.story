Police officers in the NYPD have hit back at outraged protesters furious at the death of Eric Garner, a black man who died in a police chokehold, saying he brought it upon himself.

Union officials and police supporters have seized on findings showing that Garner's asthma and obesity contributed to his death, and say they feel 'thrown under the bus' by demonstrations and politicians. 

They also said that more people should have been pointing out that Garner was wrong to resist arrest when confronted by officers in State Island, New York City, this July.

Killing: Eric Garner was killed by an NYPD officer grabbing him round the neck. Officers have pointed out that Garner's size and health issues contributed

He was wrestled to the ground and repeatedly told officers 'I can't breathe' as white patrolman Daniel Pantaleo held him round the neck.

He died in the wake of the confrontation - over the illegal sale of loose cigarettes - but a grand jury this week decided there would be no indictment over this death.

The verdict, following close behind the decision not to charge officer Darren Wilson for shooting dead Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, prompted waves of ongoing protests - which have left officers sore.

Mayor Bill de Blasio also weighed in, saying the case underscores the NYPD's need to improve relations with minorities. 

Policemen say the outcry has left them feeling betrayed and demonized by everyone from the president and the mayor to throngs of protesters who scream at them on the street.

'Police officers feel like they are being thrown under the bus,' said Patrick Lynch, president of the police union.

But Lynch said: 'What we did not hear is this: You cannot go out and break the law. What we did not hear is that you cannot resist arrest. That's a crime.'

At the noisy demonstrations that have broken out over the past few days, protesters have confronted police who had nothing to do with the case.

Signs read: 'NYPD: Blood on your hands,' 'Racism kills' and 'Hey officers, choke me or shoot me.' Some demonstrators shouted, 'NYPD pigs!' More than 280 people have been arrested, and more demonstrations were planned Friday.

In private and on internet chat rooms, officers have said they feel demoralized, misunderstood and 'all alone'.

Some are advising each other that the best way to preserve their careers is to stop making arrests like that of Garner's, in defiance of the NYPD's campaign of cracking down on minor 'quality of life' offenses as a way to discourage serious crime.

'Everyone is just demonizing the police,' said Maki Haberfeld, a professor of police studies at John Jay College of criminal justice.

'But police follow orders and laws. Nobody talks about the responsibility of the politicians to explain to the community why quality-of-life enforcement is necessary.'

Marches: People have called for police reform on the back of the Garner case. Union bosses say the message should be not to resist arrest

The fatal encounter occurred in July after Pantaleo and other police officers responded to complaints about Garner, a heavyset 43-year-old father of six.

The video showed Garner telling officers to leave him alone and refusing to be handcuffed. Pantaleo, an eight-year veteran, appeared to wrap his arm around Garner's neck and take him down to the ground with the help of other officers.

Garner could be heard saying, 'I can't breathe,' several times before he went motionless.

The medical examiner later found that a chokehold resulted in Garner's death, but also that asthma, obesity and cardiovascular disease were contributing factors.

While many have decried the death of another black man at the hands of a white officer, no evidence has come to light to suggest that Pantaleo's actions were racially motivated. His supervising sergeant at the scene was black, and so were some of the officers involved in the confrontation.

As the video sparked accusations of excessive force, the police unions mounted a counter-narrative: that Garner would still be alive if he had obeyed orders, that his poor health was the main cause of his death and that Pantaleo had used an authorized takedown move - more like a headlock than a chokehold - to subdue him.

While the grand jury proceedings were secret, Pantaleo's lawyer has said that the officer testified that he never tried to choke Garner and did not believe the man was in mortal danger.

Pantaleo's defenders have included Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who argued that the grand jury outcome would have been the same if Garner had been white, and that police were right to ignore his pleas that he couldn't breathe.

'The fact that he was able to say it meant he could breathe,' said King, the son of a police officer.

'And if you've ever seen anyone locked up, anyone resisting arrest, they're always saying, `You're breaking my arm, you're killing me, you're breaking my neck.' So if the cops had eased up or let him go at that stage, the whole struggle would have started in again.'
