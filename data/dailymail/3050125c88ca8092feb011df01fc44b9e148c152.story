Rangersesque. Or a timely reminder that, however wildly the oldco/newco debate may still rage in certain quarters, some things never change. When these two teams meet, there is invariably only one winner.

Cowdenbeath chairman Donald Findlay weighed into the fray at the weekend with his assertion that Rangers are a ‘new entity’. On Tuesday night at Central Park, his boys found their opponents just as difficult to beat as any Rangers side in history; their wait for a first victory over the Ibrox outfit since April 1930 goes on.

An early strike by Nicky Law, a Kyle Miller own goal and a late finish by sub David Templeton were enough to take Ally McCoist’s team another three points closer to the Championship summit, as they navigated another potentially tricky encounter on a cold night in Cowdenbeath, where men are men — and even the bravest are happy to wear crash helmets.

There’s no place quite like it on Planet Football.

The tyre marks on the infield provided a visible reminder, if the well-worn track and the safety fences weren’t enough, of the fact that Central Park is arguably much more famous for stock-car racing than football; this might have been one of the few nights when the beautiful game attracted as many as the meat-and-potatoes motorsport action.

Rangers were the reason for the bigger than usual crowd, of course. If the home punters turned up hoping to see the visitors skid and slide to disaster, the majority flocked to the stadium purely to laud the team expected — still — to win the Championship title.

McCoist’s men started the night seven points behind leaders Hearts, albeit with a game in hand, and here was the perfect opportunity to close that gap and apply some pressure to the Gorgie boys.

Cowdenbeath were joint-bottom of the table, level on points with Alloa, and had been conceding at a rate of over two-and-a-half goals per game. An open goal for Rangers, if ever there was, to take one more small step on the journey back to the elite division.

If that sounds like a stop-gap sort of ambition, supporters have become well accustomed to this new reality by now.

Never mind the fact that this game was taking place 22 years exactly after the Champions League glories at Elland Road. The fact that they were still playing in UEFA’s premier club competition five years ago to the night, against Unirea, is neither here nor there.

Rangers were here to win and, with Hearts setting such a brisk pace, any hint of a slip-up would have been reason for concern. They needed a quick start.

That very thing was provided with just minutes on the clock, as the pairing of Law and Kris Boyd exchanged passes to cut a broad swathe through the inside right channel, the Rangers midfielder beating goalkeeper Robbie Thomson with a sharp, low finish across goal.

Behind before they had even really got themselves into the game, Cowdenbeath might have crumbled. Instead, they seemed to discover a swagger belying both the situation and their status.

From former Wolves kid Nat Wedderburn playing his way out of defence, to the force of nature that is on-loan Dundee United striker Kudus Oyenuga, the Blue Brazil actually looked a more than decent side.

Ex-Tottenham forward Oyenuga caused Darren McGregor all sorts of problems, the Londoner dropping off his marker to pick up the ball and then, invariably, running at him with intent, displaying enough pace to make him dangerous — and more than a few tricks.

With 16 minutes gone, Oyenuga left McGregor for dead on the left, skipped along the bye-line and drilled in a low cross that required a brilliant Steven Smith clearance under pressure from Sean Higgins.

If Rangers always looked to have the better overall quality in attack, with on-loan Celtic defender Marcus Fraser forced into a great saving block on Kenny Miller and Wedderburn required to make a similarly important intervention on Smith, they also had to defend.

New Scotland call-up Lewis Macleod was booked for two ill-timed lunges in the space of minutes, with Rangers also riding their luck at times.

This was never more true than just after the half-hour mark, as Declan Hughes showed a bit of nous on the edge of the box to put Higgins in one-on-one, the striker’s left-footed shot scudding past Steve Simonsen — but bouncing off the keeper’s left post.

Rangers came close to making it 2-0 just a minute into the second half, a Smith corner from the left cleared only as far as Lee McCulloch, whose thumping low drive beat Thomson but not the vigilant figure of Dean Brett, in position at the far post to make a goal-line clearance.

The crucial second came from a brilliant finish by ‘K Miller’. Just not the ‘K Miller’ Rangers fans might have expected. Boyd’s deep cross from the right was looking for his strike partner — but the defender got there well ahead of him, his header flying in off the underside of the bar for a truly spectacular own goal.

The right-back very nearly made amends for his howler within seconds, forcing Simonsen into a full-stretch save with an absolute belter of a free-kick from nearly 30 yards out.

But, by now, this game was heading in one direction, as Rangers eased clear of a tiring home side, Templeton making it 3-0 with six minutes remaining as he finished from a neat Ian Black pass.
