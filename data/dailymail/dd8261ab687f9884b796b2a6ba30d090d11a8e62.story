A dog whose head became wedged between two boulders at a children's playpark had to be freed with two car jacks after both firefighters and the RSPCA were unable to help.

Cocker spaniel Eric was trapped for an hour and a half at the park in Blackburn, Lancashire, while worried owner Paula Gerrard, and her partner Carl, called the fire service.

Ms Gerrard said firefighters told her it was the RSPCA’s job to free him, but the charity didn’t have an officer free to help.

As Eric became more distressed the couple decided to use car jacks to lift the boulders.

The couple and their three-year-old daughter Sophia were walking Cocker Spaniels 
Eric and Henry at Witton County Park, Blackburn, when Eric got struck 
near to the children’s playground.

Ms Gerrard, 40, said: 'On the path you walk through with dogs, there’s boulders that people can sit on. Carl sat on one with the dogs on their leads while I pushed Sophia on the swings.

'Eric started yelping, because he got his head stuck between two of the boulders.'

The family, who live in Blackburn, struggled to free nine-year-old Eric.

But even with the help of passers-by they couldn’t get his head loose.

Ms Gerrard said: 'It was distressing for us all. Eric was struggling and trying to free himself. He was hurting himself so I had to pin him to the floor.

'I rang the fire brigade and they said I needed to call the RSPCA, who would evaluate the situation, and it was up to them to call the fire brigade.

'It took me 20 minutes to get through to speak to somebody. Eric was trapped for one and a half hours before we managed to get him free using two car jacks.'

She said she was disappointed with the RSPCA, adding: 'They rang us just as we got Eric free and said the fire brigade would send an engine.'

An RSPCA spokeswoman said: 'One of our inspectors started making her way to the scene to try and help.

Nine-year-old Eric has since made a full recovery from his playground ordeal

'The inspector, who was the nearest, was an hour and a half away from the country park dealing with another animal in need, so she called the fire and rescue service and asked them to help if they could.

'We are a charity which answers to more than a million calls for help every year and at busy times there can be a queue on our phone lines.

'On this evening the inspector had been dealing with a case of a horse which had been attacked by children and a kitten which had broken its leg in an accident in Yorkshire.'

A fire service spokesman added: 'When we receive a call from the owner of a small animal that is trapped, we always ask the RSPCA to investigate first and see if they can free the animal without the need for a fire engine which may be required for a life critical incident.

'If the RSPCA cannot free the animal by themselves, a fire engine will be sent to the scene to assist.'
