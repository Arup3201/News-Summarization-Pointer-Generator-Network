With its health benefits and celebrity fans, super-hydrating coconut water is the must-have drink of 2013.

But hot on its heels is mineral-rich aloe vera juice. Market trend predictors are singing the 
praises of nutrient-packed, cholesterol-lowering aloe vera-based drinks.

The latest must-sip claims to aid weight loss, digestion, immune function, and even ease general discomfort.

Move over, coconut water! With its cocktail of vitamins and minerals, aloe vera juice is tipped to be the season's hottest health trend

Aloe Vera contains a multitude of vitamins including A, C, E, folic acid, B1, B2, B3, B6 and is one of the few plants that contains vitamin B12, which helps with brain and nervous system function.

It is also mineral-rich, containing calcium, magnesium, zinc, chromium, selenium, sodium, iron, and potassium, as well as being packed with amino and fatty acids - all helpful in beating indigestion.

Much like super food favourites chia 
seeds and seaweed, aloe vera is a gelatinous plant food and well-known 
adaptogen, which boosts the body’s natural ability to resist illness and
 also eliminates toxins.

Nutritionist Madeleine Shaw, who works with Millie Mackintosh, said: 'Aloe Vera is amazing if you have any suggestive discomfort. It is very soothing for the internals and helps beat the bloat.'

The plant juice, which is sold in health stores such as the Nutri Centre and Holland and Barrett, has traditionally been used to treat burns and psoriasis.

However,
 information regarding its use dates back nearly 5,000 years to early 
Egyptian times, when it was cited as being a powerful herbal medicine.

Multi-use: The plant juice has traditionally been used to treat skin conditions but now people are starting to catch on to the benefits of drinking it

Shona Wilkinson, Head Nutritionist at The Nutri Centre, said: 'Most people are aware of the benefits of aloe vera applied topically for sunburn but the benefits are far more wide than just that - especially when taken internally.

'Drinking aloe vera replenishes your body naturally with a huge range of nutrients. It contains approximately 200 active components including - vitamins A, B1,B2,B6, B12, C, E, folic acid and Niacin.

'Many people take aloe vera to help with digestion but it is also taken for good immunity, cleansing and good skin health. 

'Aloe vera is often used to help with the symptoms of Irritable bowel syndrome and has also been shown to be helpful for conditions such as acid reflux.

'Overall its a great all rounder, jam packed full of nutrients!'
