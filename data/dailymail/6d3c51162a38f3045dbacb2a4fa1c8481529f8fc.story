The study found that individuals started to become more aware of their health while in their mid thirties

In our teens, twenties and much of our thirties, it seems, many of us think we  are indestructible.

But at 36, all that changes.

That is the age, according to a study, that we start to become aware of our mortality and adopt a healthier lifestyle.

A death in the family, a warning from the doctor or seeing an unflattering photo are the type of events that make people think differently, says a survey by Spire Bristol Hospital.

The study of 2,000 people assessed 
attitudes to health and found 56 per cent deliberately ignored warnings 
or indulged in unhealthy lifestyles in a ‘live for the moment’ approach -
 regardless of the long-term impact.

But the average person can expect a health wake-up call by age 36, with over a third saying they had a shocking moment which changed their thinking such as seeing a relative fall ill, having a health scare themselves or getting negative comments from a friend.

The research found that once people start to consider their future health, they take measures like monitoring and improving their diet and reducing their alcohol intake.

Rob Anderson, director at Spire Bristol, said: 'These findings show that by our mid-thirties, health and well-being become a much bigger priority.

'Doing something about it can be daunting prospect, but there’s lots of support designed to help people lead healthier lives.

'Simple lifestyle changes can make a big difference and reassessing how we live our lives, and the value we place on healthcare, can mean huge long-term benefits.'

However, the study also found that a free roaming six in ten adopt the 
‘life’s too short’ philosophy to justify choices they know have long 
term health effects like binge drinking or a fat-rich diet.

The top 10 health wake-up call moments:

1. Getting older

2. I had a health scare

3. A close relative died

4. A warning from my doctor

5. Seeing a shocking photo of myself

6. A close relative fell ill

7. A TV programme about bad eating habits

8. Negative comments about my health that hit a nerve

9. I had a serious accident

10. A public health message

Worryingly just four in ten thought looking after their long term health was more important than ‘living for the now.’

One in ten describe their current exercise regime as completely non-existent, while a further three in ten claim their only regular exercise comes from their day to day routine.

The lackadaisical approach of some was also highlighted with one in eight actively choosing to rely on the NHS repairing the damage, rather than taking positive steps themselves.

And one in seven deliberately ignores health warnings on a regular basis to indulge in potentially damaging lifestyle choices.

When it came to taking action, people were most likely to say that they weren’t exercising enough while fixing their diet and not getting enough sleep were other problem areas.

Just 51 per cent would rather take preventive measures and try to avoid ill health or long-term consequences.

Despite rude awakening in their mid-thirties, even those who turned over a new leaf can fall back into old habits.

Rob Anderson added: 'Once people start to take responsibility for their health it’s important that they can access healthcare services swiftly and easily.

'Rapid diagnosis and getting issues sorted quickly can help people live longer, healthier lives. At Spire we offer the best possible service to help people take control of their wellbeing.'
