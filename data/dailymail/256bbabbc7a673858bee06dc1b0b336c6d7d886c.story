Former NFL football player Keith Carlos has made history by becoming first man to win America's Next Top Model.

Carlos, who played wide receiver for the Philadelphia Eagles and the New York Giants, beat 30 other men and women to win the competition.

'I've always been told I should model... but I was so attached to football that I never really immersed myself into it,' Carlos told Zap2it.com.

'So once my career came to an end, I was like, I'm gonna do something different.'

And his decision to change it up certainly had a fruitful ending. In the show's second season with both male and female contestants, Carlos became the first ever male winner.

He proudly announced the news on Instagram with a photo of himself and host Tyra Banks, writing in the caption: 'This one is also for the MEN out there trying to succeed in a female-dominated industry.

'This is for the young in urban America with a single mother, no guidance, and a chip on their shoulder.' 

Carlos makes an appearance at New York Fashion Week in September 

He continued: 'Those that know me know that I want to see everyone win in life and this is who I am to the core. We need more positive role models out there to change the direction our society is going.

'I'm glad I am the new trend setter for this generation! It's a great responsibility and I'm strong enough to do so.'

Now, thanks to his appearance and triumph on America's Next Top Model, he is thrilled to gain international exposure.

'I'd like to walk in all the fashion shows I can - New York, L.A, internationally,' Carlos added. 'I'm looking everywhere to take this opportunity I have now and really make the most of it.'
