A staff writer for The New Yorker has resigned and sales of his latest book suspended after he admitted to inventing quotes by Bob Dylan.

Jonah Lehrer released a statement today through his publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt saying that some Dylan quotes which appeared in his book, Imagine: How Creativity Works, did 'not exist'.

Others were 'unintentional misquotations, or represented improper combinations of previously existing quotes'.

It Ain't Me Babe: Author Jonah Lehrer (right) resigned from his staff job at The New Yorker after he made up Bob Dylan quotes for his latest book

Lehrer said he acknowledged his actions after being contacted by Michael Moynihan of the online publication Tablet Magazine. Earlier today Tablet released an in-depth story on the Dylan passages in Imagine.

In his statement, Lehrer wrote: 'I told Mr. Moynihan that they [the quotes in question] were from archival interview footage provided to me by Dylan's representatives.

'This was a lie spoken in a moment of panic. When Mr. Moynihan followed up, I continued to lie, and say things I should not have said.

'The lies are over now. I understand the gravity of my position. I want to apologize to everyone I have let down, especially my editors and readers.'

On his Twitter account, Moynihan responded: 'Jonah Lehrer has resigned from the New Yorker and apologized to me. Not that this matters, but I accept his apology and wish him luck.'

Among Lehrer's inventions was a quote
that first appeared in the famous documentary from the mid-1960s, Don't
Look Back, in which Dylan told a reporter about his songs: 'I just 
write them. There's no great message.'

In Imagine, Lehrer adds a third sentence - 'Stop asking me to explain' - that does not appear in the film.

Inaccuracy: Lehrer admitted that he had used quotes by Dylan that did not exist in his new book

According to Tablet, Lehrer also 
invented quotes on how Dylan wrote Like a Rolling Stone and, when 
confronted about them, alleged that he had been granted access to an 
uncut version of No Direction Home, a Dylan documentary made by Martin 
Scorsese.

Lehrer has now admitted he never saw such footage.

Publisher Houghton Mifflin said in a statement that Lehrer had committed a 'serious misuse'.

Listings for the e-book edition of Imagine will be removed and shipments of the physical book have been stopped.

The book was published in March and had been selling well, ranking No.105 on Amazon.com today. Amazon had cited the book among the best March releases.

A spokesman for Dylan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Canceled books inevitably lead to calls for publishers to fact-check releases.

However publishers said the time and expense of reviewing thousands of texts, on a vast range of subjects, makes the process impractical.

Jonah Lehrer, 31, graduated from Columbia University in 2003 with a major in neuroscience.

He went on to study literature and philosophy at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar.

Along with the ill-fated Imagine: How Creativity Works, published earlier this year, he is also the author of two other books -  Proust Was a Neuroscientist in 2007 and How We Decide two years later.

Along with The New Yorker, he has written for Grantland, Nature, Seed, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and The Boston Globe.

'Publishing books is fundamentally different from publishing a newspaper or magazine,' Houghton Mifflin said in a statement.

'We rely on the authors' contractual warranties that the work is original and, for non-fiction, accurate.

'Nonetheless we consider accuracy and originality to be essential standards, and whenever any of our authors transgresses these standards we take it very seriously.'

Lehrer, 31, was once a rising star at The New Yorker, which is famous for its thorough fact checking.

The writer was already in trouble with the magazine after he acknowledged last month that he had recycled passages he had written for previous publications.

Some recycled passages also appeared in Imagine, the latest of three books by Lehrer who is known for his explorations of science and literature and how the mind works.

New Yorker Editor David Remnick said: 'This is a terrifically sad situation, but, in the end, what is most important is the integrity of what we publish and what we stand for.'

Dylan himself has been challenged about his use of material. His album Modern Times included lines lifted from blues songs and from the Civil War poet Henry Timrod.

An exhibition of paintings by the rock star turned out to contain images from other sources.
