Kirstie Allsopp, pictured here with her children, has suggested girls should ditch university and focus on becoming a mother

When it comes to domestic matters, she has always been outspoken.

But Kirstie Allsopp’s latest advice to girls to forget university and concentrate on having babies first has attracted howls of outrage.

She said that rather than go to university, young women should focus on finding a man and having a family before their fertility ‘falls off a cliff’ at 35.

The 42-year-old television presenter – who gave birth to her two sons at 35 and 37 – said if she had a daughter she would give her this advice: ‘I would say, “Darling, do you know what? Don’t go to university. Start work straight after school, stay at home, save up your deposit – I’ll help you, let’s get you into a flat. And then we can find you a nice boyfriend and you can have a baby by the time you’re 27.”’

The Location, Location, Location star, who has been in a relationship with property developer Ben Andersen for ten years, said it is time to speak ‘frankly’ about fertility.

‘At the moment, women have 15 years to go to university, get their career on track, try and buy a home and have a baby.

‘That is a hell of a lot to ask someone. As a passionate feminist, I feel we have not been honest enough with women about this issue.

We have to readjust. Don’t go to university because it’s an “experience”. No, it’s where you’re supposed to learn something! Do it when you’re 50!’

However, her comments in a newspaper interview yesterday attracted fierce criticism.

Jo Heywood, headmistress of the prestigious girls-only Heathfield School, said: ‘Her talk of boyfriends and babies is rather patronising for the generation I am preparing for university and beyond.’

Conservative MP Angela Bray described Miss Allsopp as a ‘bit 1950s’.

And psychologist Dr Linda Papadopoulos said: ‘It seems quite an antiquated idea that because we have ovaries, we shouldn’t have a career. I think this is telling girls to not do what is the most important thing at that age, which is to invest in your education, become self-sufficient.

‘It’s certainly not advice I would give my daughter.’

Miss Allsopp – who did not go to university – divided opinion among her 348,000 followers on Twitter.

Some called her ‘stuck in the past’ but others agreed with her.

However, she stood by her comments, tweeting yesterday: ‘Still pleased I raised the issue of the fertility window. It is scary being out on a limb and some folk being vile but majority sensible.’
