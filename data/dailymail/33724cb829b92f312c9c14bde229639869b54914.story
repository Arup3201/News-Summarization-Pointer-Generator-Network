The family of a mother who was found beaten to death by her husband six hours after a neighbor called 911 for help have filed a lawsuit against the city of Denver.

Loretta Barela's heartbroken relatives said in a federal lawsuit filed on Monday that the 44-year-old might have survived if dispatchers had sent police sooner.

A neighbor called 911 around 2am on November 18, 2012 to report seeing a shirtless Barela being punched and dragged across the street by a man.

When police failed to arrive after 45 minutes, the neighbor called 911 again.

Attack: Loretta Barela, left, was beaten to death by her husband Christopher Perea, right, in November 2012. A concerned neighbor called 911 at 2am but her body was not discovered until 8.15am

Scene: Officers showed up at the home an hour after the first 911 call but knocked on the couple's door, pictured, but left after no one answered. Perea called cops himself hours later to report the killing

Officers finally arrived around 3am and knocked on the front door and shone lights through a window but left when no one answered.

Eventually, Barela's husband, 41-year-old Christopher Perea, called authorities to say he believed he had killed his wife. He said her body was 'cold' and that her jaw was 'stiff'.

Her beaten body was found inside their home around 8.15am. Perea was arrested and later convicted in her murder.

'I just want to know why they didn't do anything about it,' he daughter Marie Cruz said to 9news at the time. 'She is tiny. She's only 90 pounds getting beaten by a man.'

The lawsuit names the city of Denver, four 911 employees and two officers, who they say failed to thoroughly investigate before leaving 18 minutes after they arrived.

At the time, Fox31 reported that police sources said they can only kick in a door when it appears to be an emergency, but it was unknown how much the officers knew.

Heartbroken: Her daughter, left, and sister, right, said after the attack that they wanted to know why officers failed to help Barela. The family has now filed a lawsuit against the city, dispatchers and police officers

The lawsuit also says that the dispatchers ignored the urgency of the neighbor's calls reporting a life-threatening emergency. At least one dispatcher resigned.

'Somebody can find another job but you can't replace my mom, you really can't,' her tearful daughter told Fox31.

The case was among several recent problems at the 911 center.

In April 2012, a 911 caller reporting a threatening situation was told Denver police wouldn't take a report unless he returned to city limits. He returned to Denver and was killed within blocks of the earlier incident.

And this April, Denver police officials said they were delayed saving a woman after a dispatcher who failed to relay information to officers about the gravity of the situation.

In that case, Kristine Kirk frantically called 911 saying her husband Richard was hallucinating after eating marijuana-infused candy and was getting a gun from a safe. 

Failed: In another Denver case, Kristine Kirk, left, called 911 saying her husband Richard, right, was threatening to shoot her after eating marijuana-infused candy. She was shot after a slow police response

She was shot dead more than 12 minutes into her 911 call.

Officials made several changes to their response policies after Kirk's killing, including requiring dispatchers to give certain calls, such as those involving weapons, the highest priority.

The new rules also give officers more authority to decide how to respond to calls in which a person is in imminent danger.

The suit says the cases show 'a widespread custom or policy of failing to identify and/or prioritize situations involving imminent danger or a life threatening emergency'.

City Attorney Scott Martinez said late on Monday that he had not seen the lawsuit and he could not comment.
