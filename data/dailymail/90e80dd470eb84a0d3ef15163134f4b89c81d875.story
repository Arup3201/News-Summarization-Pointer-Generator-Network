Ahead of Super Saturday, Sportsmail's Sir Clive Woodward rates the three contenders for the 2015 RBS 6 Nations title...

ENGLAND

Why they can win it

I’m increasingly encouraged by their intent to attack and the willingness to keep the ball moving. Despite missing chances against Scotland, for the first time in a while our strike runners consistently found clean air to run in.

George Ford has brought confidence to this backline and it helps having two of his Bath team-mates starting alongside him. But expect a much tougher defensive line against France.

Most importantly, I believe England will win because they need to. In Stuart Lancaster’s fourth year in charge they are yet to win this competition. A number of these players have been alongside Lancaster throughout and will be just as desperate to win, most notably captain Chris Robshaw. This is their best chance.

They have the points advantage, they are playing last and they are also the only contender playing at home. Everyone in Twickenham by 5pm will know what is needed to win the title and it will be a great atmosphere. I expect England to play well.

Why they might blow it

I still rate the England pack very highly, though they need a bit more pace in the back row and the recycling of possession must be quicker. They haven’t reached the heights of the autumn and that will frustrate Graham Rowntree.

It’s a concern they are finishing the tournament with less of an idea of the starting pack than when it kicked off. Geoff Parling coming in is the right call, but I am amazed there is no specialist second row on the bench. If there’s an injury early on, can we expect Nick Easter to play most of the game there against France? That could cost England.

There have been many examples recently where England have made the wrong decision which has cost them points and the opportunity to build a score. Lancaster’s side still lack the killer instinct against top sides. Also, France have been written off but that is completely wrong. England will have to be ready for a colossal physical encounter.

Who would you pay to watch?

Jonathan Joseph. He has been a massive find and even if they take nothing else away from the championship they appear to have found an outside centre with world-class potential.

I still believe that they need a better footballer at No 12 — and not picking Henry Slade has been a missed opportunity — but in Joseph they have a player they can build a team around. It is saying something that Manu Tuilagi’s absence hasn’t been felt too much. I have also been hugely impressed with Ford.

The coach’s strengths?

England operate more as a team of coaches, headed by Lancaster — compared with Wales and Ireland where Warren Gatland and Joe Schmidt are very much dominant figures.

I always put a great amount of stock in having everyone’s noses pointing in the same direction, but this becomes more difficult with more people involved. There are few coaches around who have achieved this, as Lancaster has with England.

Despite some disappointments there is an air of calm about the team and belief in what they are doing. Surrounding himself with Rowntree, Andy Farrell and Mike Catt, he has the strongest coaching team in the northern hemisphere.

IRELAND

Why they can win it

Between Jonny Sexton, Conor Murray and Paul O’Connell they have the best game management side.

They also have a strong set-piece and they do the basics very well. This goes for their kicking game as well, with Rob Kearney and Tommy Bowe’s consistency a real nuisance.

They are also playing Scotland, even if the hosts do play better in Edinburgh. And if the game is dead for Scotland with 20 minutes to go, will they mind hugely if it is the Irish not the English who win the tournament?

Why they might blow it

While I don’t think Ireland will be concerned heading to Murrayfield, they need to score at least three tries. They should set themselves a target of winning by at least 21 points. This would leave England having to win by 15 against France. But can they cross the whitewash enough?

Who would you pay to watch?

Paul O’Connell. I worked with Paul during the 2005 Lions Tour and although it was a losing tour, I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work with him. Whatever position a youngster might play, they should look to how Paul conducts himself on and off the field.

His work-rate, commitment and attitude is outstanding, but it is easy to overlook what a great player he is. A real giant of the game.

The coach’s strengths?

Ireland have been unfairly criticised for their tactics. They are nowhere near as one-dimensional as they have been portrayed. In Joe Schmidt they have the outstanding tactician in the competition.

Schmidt is a pragmatist who identifies opponent’s weak points and attacks them ruthlessly. If that involves kicking every other play I have no problem with that.

WALES

Why they can win it

They are hitting form at the right time and the way Wales have bounced back from the defeat by England has been truly impressive.

I could see them running up a big score against Italy. They have the most to do in terms of points difference, but it would be fascinating if they could do what England did last year and put 50 points on Italy.

Wales have the potential to score five or six tries if they get going.

Why they might blow it

They need to keep Italy to six points or less. It is the scrum which can cause them problems, taking up territory and time. Losing prop Samson Lee is a massive blow.

Who would you pay to watch?

Sam Warburton is the outstanding player and leader in the northern hemisphere. His work over the ball is exceptional and he has the pace that openside flankers need allied to incredible strength when carrying. Take five minutes to watch Warburton go about his work. 

What I like most is how he lifts his performance for the big games. He’s a real warrior any coach would want to work with.

Sam Warburton has led Wales superbly through the current championship with his workrate and power 

The coach’s strengths?

Warren Gatland’s c.v. is impressive and his coaches are squarely behind him — the Welsh style is clear but incredibly difficult to stop, especially when playing an inferior team. Beating Ireland at their own game was brilliant to watch. Gatland brings the best out of Shaun Edwards, his defence coach, and the effort against Ireland was world-class.

PREDICTION

Ireland will win by a few, Wales will win by a lot and England will be in a very tight game so it could come down to just one or two points. If I had a free bet, I’d put it on Ireland because if the Scots implode they could rack up points.
