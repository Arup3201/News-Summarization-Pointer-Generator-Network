At least four American hostages being held in Syria by ISIS were waterboarded during their captivity claims a new report.

James Foley, Steven J. Sotloff, and two other captives were subjected to the brutal practice according to people familiar with their treatment.

The source added that ISIS militants appear to have modeled the technique on the 'CIA’s use of waterboarding during interrogations following the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.'

A source says ISIS militants are modeling their use of waterboarding on the technique the CIA used for coercive interrogation following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001

'They knew exactly how it was done,' said a person with direct knowledge of the situation who spoke to the Washington Post on the condition of anonymity.

Waterboarding is a form of torture in which an individual is strapped down while water is poured over a cloth covering their face, making the victim feel as if they are drowning. 

President Obama has condemned the practice, and a 2008 op-ed written by Democratic senators Dianne Feinstein of California and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island criticized this form of coercive interrogation out of fear that militant groups and dictators might attempt to waterboard American captives.

'Waterboarding dates to the Spanish Inquisition and has been a favorite of dictators through the ages, including Pol Pot and the regime in Burma,' the two wrote while supporting an anti-torture bill.

'Condoning torture opens the door for our enemies to do the same to captured American troops in the future.'

Foley, who was abducted on November 22, 2012, was beheaded last week in retaliation for U.S. airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq.

The group is now threatening to execute Sotloff, 31,  as well.

His mother, Shirley Sotloff, released a video pleading with her son's captors to let him go on Wednesday.

'I am sending this message to you, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi al-Quraishi al-Hussaini, the caliph of the Islamic State. I am Shirley Sotloff. My son Steven is in your hands,' she says in her message. 

'You, the caliph, can grant amnesty. I ask you please to release my child. I ask you to use your authority to spare his life.'

She then adds at the end of her video, 'Steven has no control over the actions of the U.S. government. He is an innocent journalist.'

Last week, Didier Francois, a French journalist who was held captive with Foley for eight months in Syria following his June 2013 kidnapping, said members of ISIS singled Foley out for beatings and mock executions after learning that his brother worked for the US Air Force.

In one mock execution, Foley, who Francois calls an 'extraordinary guy,' was crucified against a wall. 

Francois had never shared any of this information as he was told by his captors before his release in April of this year: 'If you make public the fact they are being held or that you were together, reprisals will follow against [Foley, Sotloff, and the other remaining captives].' 

Members of ISIS released another video earlier today that they claim is a beheading of another one of their prisoners, an Iraqi Kurdish fighter.
