Jack Grealish has signed a new, improved contract at Aston Villa that will see him commit his future to the club for the next four years.

The winger, 19, has been on the radar of most Premier League clubs, most notably Chelsea, as his old deal ran out at the end of this season.

But fresh terms have seen his wages rise significantly.

'I'm delighted and it's a dream come true to commit my future to my boyhood club,' Grealish said.

'I've had a season ticket at Villa since I was four years old and came to every game,so this is a big thing for me and my family.' 

Grealish, a Villa fan born in Solihull, has been elevated to the first-team squad in this campaign, putting in a number of eye-catching displays from the bench and is one of the country's most highly-rated youngsters.

He is at the centre of a tussle between Ireland and England over his international ambitions. Martin O'Neill wants him to progress from the Republic's Under 21 set-up to the senior squad, while Three Lions U21 boss Gareth Southgate has spoken of his interest.

He qualifies for Ireland through his father's parents.

Roy Keane, Villa and Ireland assistant manager, warned last week against putting the young player under too much scrutiny.

'He's done very little in the game yet,' Keane said. 'People are getting a bit carried away, he's not started a game in the league for Villa, he's not scored a goal yet, he's not got an assist yet.

'If he wants to come and play for Ireland, we'll be delighted but we can't be begging people either. If they want to play for Ireland, fantastic. If not, we'll have to accept it.'
