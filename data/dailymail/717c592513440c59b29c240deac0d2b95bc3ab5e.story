Despite seeing the defeat of his favoured candidate Mitt Romney, Donald Trump has refused to exit the political fray since Tuesday's election.

His latest sally today was an attack on Chris Matthews, the MSNBC host who caused a controversy on Tuesday night when he said he was 'so glad' Hurricane Sandy had hit the Atlantic coast and allowed Barack Obama to be re-elected.

The eccentric tycoon tweeted that 'MSNBC should fire him immediately', adding: 'Tweet me back if u think we should start a petition to fire @hardball_chris for his comments on Sandy & the death & destruction it caused.'

Outspoken: Donald Trump has been very active on Twitter since seeing his side lose the election

Trump has been particularly active on Twitter since Obama's re-election was confirmed, writing that the result was 'a total sham and a travesty' as he argued, 'Our country is now in serious and unprecedented trouble.'

After his comments were denounced by Brian Williams, he flew into a rage at the NBC anchor, tweeting: 'Wouldn't you love to have my ratings?'

The star of The Apprentice was a strong supporter of Romney - and the relationship between the two men has been blamed by some for leading to the candidate's landslide defeat.

Chris Matthews' comments had earlier been greeted with outrage by Republicans and independents on Twitter.

Assault: Trump called for Matthews to be fired over his controversial televised comments

'What kind of sicko says they're so happy we had that hurricane last week? Seriously Chris Matthews is beyond revolting,' tweeted 'Christine915'.

Others were more level headed in their criticism, with Justin Hill taking to the social networking site to say that, 'No amount of political points are worth even one life lost.'

Another Twitter user called 'Stephanie Scanlon' called Matthews 'a disgusting excuse for a person', while 'Marcia Chimie' said that he was 'a disgrace to humanity.'

Even in the MSNBC studio, where he was on a panel including Rachel Maddow, Matthews' comments caused an audible 'oooo', leading him to raise his hand to explain.

The MSNBC host claimed that he was happy that Sandy had occurred because it gave President Obama a much needed boost in the polls

The 66-year-old news anchor clarified his comments on air as politically speaking - but the damage was already done

'No, politically I should say - not in terms of hurting people,' explained a backtracking Matthews. 'The storm brought in possibilities for good politics.'

Despite hailing the storm-of-a-lifetime for aiding the re-election of President Obama at the expense of Mitt Romney, the controversial MSNBC host took to Twitter where he clarified his statement.

'To clarify - I was thrilled at the cooperation between the President and state officials that made the country proud. Great bipartisanship,' he tweeted.

'Obviously I wasn't talking about the horror of the storm. I grew up on the Jersey shore,' Matthews wrote.

The death toll from Sandy has already exceeded 100 and many who were in the path of the storm in New Jersey and New York lost their property and were forced into emergency shelter - which some are still relying on.

The massive weather system also caused mayhem on Election Day, with many voting districts and precincts facing power outages, fuel shortages and some had to light up their polling places with flares in the dark.

Indeed, findings from the Pew Research Center's election weekend survey in the aftermath of the storm said that President Obama held a 48-percent to 45-percent lead over Romney among those likely to vote.

This was compared to a week before the storm which had each candidate level on 47 per cent of the likely vote.

The respected center polled 2,709 likely voters from October 31st to November 3rd in their final pre-election survey while the previous survey dated from October 24th to 28th.

In fact according to Pew, 69 per cent of all likely voters approved of the way President Obama handled the storm's impact and 46 per cent of Romney's supporters did too.

More importantly for President Obama, 63 per cent of swing voters looked favourably on his handling of the storm and its effects.

Analysts said that the storm boosted Obama's image among voters by visibly allowing him to show a bipartisan side.

His rapprochement with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and the manner in which he was publicly thanked by one of his fiercest critics was seen as damaging to Mitt Romney.

This was especially the case as Chris Christie had been the keynote speaker at the Republican National Convention and had been one of Romney's most vocal supporters.

But, even before his massively controversial comments last night, Matthews had been ruffling feathers with his forthright political opinions during early Election Day coverage.

One of his first targets were Americans who do not vote - describing them as idiots, before attacking those who vote for third party candidates.

'If you haven't voted, I don't want to talk to you,' said Matthews earlier in his broadcast.

'And if you vote for one of these numbskull third or fourth party candidates like Gary Johnson or Joe Steele and then you go "Oh, I was surprised by what happened," well, you shouldn't be.

'Because idiots like you voted for a third or fourth party candidate and they don't know how how the system works: two choices.'

Indeed, Matthews capped off a memorable evening for himself by praising Mitt Romney's concession speech instead of attacking President Obama's victory one.

'I mean, I thought Romney’s speech last night was a piece of wonder,' said Matthews.

'I thought the way he came out alone and stood in one, as they say on Broadway, right out there by himself — not with the wife, with the shoulder to cry on or any of that — stood out there with manliness and grace, and did absolutely everything right. ‘

'"I called the President. I wish him well." This is out of the book. This is how you do it; it’s Biblical. And every single thing was classic, perfect.'
