He is one of America's most wanted fugitives, but it seems that Edward Snowden could be living in luxury at a hotel at a Moscow airport.

The Novotel Moscow Sheremetyevo picks travellers up from the airport, transports them in a bus and houses them on a sealed floor, ensuring that they never step on Russian soil.

Snowden requested asylum in Russia after he leaked papers revealing many of America's secrets.

ladimir Putin offered the U.S. 
whistleblower Snowden political asylum - as long as he stops damaging 
'our American partners' with his leaks.

'Russia never 
hands over anybody anywhere and has no intention to do so,' said the 
Kremlin leader, defying a specific U.S. request.

On the run: Edward Snowden requested political asylum from countries around the world

Offer: Russia offered Snowden asylum on the condition that he does not leak anymore confidential information about the United States

Atrium: The massive hotel is thought to be home to Edward Snowden as he seeks a country that will give him unconditional political asylum

Hideout: Snowden is currently in the transit areas of Sheremetievo airport in Moscow

'If he [Snowden] wants to remain here
there is one condition - he should stop his work aimed at inflicting 
damage on our American partners no matter how strange this may sound 
coming from me.'

He showed he does not want 
to provoke a new Cold War in relations with the U.S. by firmly insisting
Snowden should stop his disclosures on covert operations which have 
caused embarrassment to America and infuriated the country's allies in 
the EU.

Seeking asylum: Snowden's options are shrinking as countries turn down his requests for asylum

Ecuadorean President: Rafael Correa said earlier this week he had yet to consider letting U.S. intelligence leaker Edward Snowden enter his country but was said to be going cold on the idea

Russian President: Vladimir Putin said Snowden can stay in Russia if he stops the leaks

Snowden has claimed that the US hacked into communications in countries across the world.

It has caused international outrage, with leaders of European countries such as France's Francois Hollande.

Ecuador's
president Rafael Correa said on Saturday that Snowden is 'under the care 
of Russian authorities', while also suggesting they did not let him 
reach the country's Moscow embassy where he could apply for asylum.

Venezuela has emerged as the country most likely to house the whistleblower.

Nicol√°s Maduro said that the NSA whistleblower had not made a formal application for refuge but that he deserved protection under international law.

Snowden has so far applied for asylum in 21 countries but faces a thinning list of options after Finland, India, Ecuador and Poland rejected his plea and a number of others said applications can only be made in person on their home soil.

Government investigators began an urgent search for Edward Snowden several days before the first media reports were published on the government's secret surveillance program.

Snowden, who has admitted to providing details of the top-secret programs, had worked on assignment at a Hawaii facility run by the National Security Agency for about four weeks before he said he was ill and requested leave without pay, according to the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.

When Snowden failed to return, that prompted a hunt for the contractor, first by his employer Booz Allen Hamilton and then by the U.S. government, they said.

Snowden, 29, was known among colleagues as a very gifted 'geek,' according to one of the sources, who added, 'This guy's really good with his fingers on the keyboard. He's really good.'

Surprise: Barack Obama said before Putin's announcement that 'high-level' talks had been held between Russia and the U.S. to deport Snowden to America

Venezuelan President: Nicolas Maduro said last week that fleeing whistleblower Edward Snowden deserves political protection under the law

News: A TV screen shows a news report of Edward Snowden at a shopping mall in Hong Kong

His job as a systems administrator would have afforded Snowden very wide access to servers containing classified information at the NSA, and possibly other U.S. intelligence agencies, the same source said, without giving specifics.

U.S. officials do not yet know the extent to which Snowden was able to access intelligence databases, nor have they identified all the secret material he might have downloaded before leaving for Hong Kong, according to three sources.

Several sources said that as a systems administrator, Snowden would have been unable to actively spy on people, even though he told the Guardian newspaper, 'I, sitting at my desk, certainly had the authority to wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant, to a federal judge, to even the President.'
