Two Florida men were dying to own a Barbie car so desperately that one of them faked a heart attack to create a diversion to allow the other to steal it from a Walmart.

Tarus Scott, 30 and Gerard Dupree, 27, were arrested after their alleged ploy to steal the girl's toy was caught on tape, reports Wesh.com.

Surveillance footage from the Lake Wales Walmart on Tuesday shows two men loading a cart with a power wheel Barbie car, a Leap Frog tablet, and a Barbie Glam vacation house before trying to dupe store security.

Scott appears to roll the stolen goods out of the store as the man who police have named as Dupree fakes a coronary to distract customers and employees from the  theft.

Concerned passers-by stop to help the suspect in apparent distress and one even appears to make a 911 call.

After spending a few seconds on the ground, Dupree stands up , his hand sill pressed on his heart, and makes his way out of the store - miraculously feeling better.

Police say the men met up outside and while they drove off in the same vehicle.

They did not try to flee the scene in the Barbie car.

Both men have been charged with theft.
