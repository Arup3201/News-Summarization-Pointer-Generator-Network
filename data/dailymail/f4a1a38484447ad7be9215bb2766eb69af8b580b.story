It's the moment thousands of us dread – coming back from Ikea to the frustrating prospect of assembling the new furniture yourself.

But after 68 years of baffling directions and fiddly parts, the Swedish giant is giving shoppers the chance to put down their allen keys.

It has developed a new range which fits together with a simple ‘click’ and is held in place by wooden plugs.

The new range of IKEA furniture is held together with wooden plugs making it easier to assemble 

The revolution is the result of Ikea’s attempt to gain ground in India.

Spokesman Annelies Nauwelaerts said: ‘The middle classes in India are not so keen on assembling their furniture with a screwdriver and spanner in the living room, so we have had to develop a quicker and easier system.

‘We are also introducing the system in Europe because not everybody here is a good handyman either.’ Four items are now on sale in Belgium, including a cabinet and dining table. 

The first four sweat-free items are already on sale in Belgium including a cabinet for displaying glassware and a dining table. 

The company was founded by Ingvar Kamprad, pictured,  in Sweden 68 years ago
