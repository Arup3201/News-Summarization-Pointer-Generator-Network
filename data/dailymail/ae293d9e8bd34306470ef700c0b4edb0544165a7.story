Elaine McKay, 58, is accused of starting a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old boy while working at a school in Essex

A married teaching assistant groomed a pupil more than four decades her junior for sex, a court heard yesterday.

Elaine McKay, 58, allegedly exposed herself to the 15-year-old boy over the video chat service Skype and sent him ‘compromising’ photographs of herself.

A jury heard they ended up having sex at the teenager’s home after he took a shower and she pulled his towel off.

The alleged illicit relationship is said to have ended when her victim – who cannot be named for legal reasons – secretly allowed friends to view her performing a sex act over her webcam.

Rumours quickly began to circulate at Clacton Coastal Academy in Essex and then reached parents.

Police arrested the mother of two, who has married three times and is understood to have two grandchildren.

Richard Scott, prosecuting, yesterday said the defendant had breached her duty to ‘ensure the safekeeping and welfare of all children’.

He added: ‘They had perfectly consensual sex.

‘The only problem was he was less than 16 at the time while she was in her late 50s.

‘Although he was near the age of consent he was not at the age of consent.’

The court heard McKay, who lives in Clacton, and the boy would regularly meet each other outside school and became closer over time.

Among the photos that she allegedly sent the pupil were some of her topless.

They were discovered when a friend borrowed the alleged victim’s phone to send a text to his girlfriend and stumbled across several explicit images on mobile messaging service WhatsApp.

The friend later taunted the teenager, saying: ‘You’ve been a naughty boy.’

Describing the occasion that the pair allegedly had sex, Mr Scott said McKay called at the pupil’s house when no one else was there.

He told the jury at Chelmsford Crown Court: ‘The date the intercourse took place was not absolutely certain, but what is clear is that it took place before he was 16.

‘The victim showered and went to the bedroom with the towel around him.

Elaine McKay removed the towel … Afterwards, [she] made her excuses and said she needed to go.’

The court heard the boy sent her a message on one occasion saying ‘it isn’t right’.

McKay is accused of sending the boy indecent pictures, which he stored on his phone and showed to his friends

When the teaching assistant was arrested on May 31 last year she gave police officers a statement saying: ‘I wholly deny ever having had sexual intercourse with the victim.’

After stories about their relationship began to emerge they are said to have exchanged messages in which they discussed getting their ‘story straight’.

McKay, whose two daughters are in their 20s, denies two charges of sexual activity with a child.

The first charge involves having sex with a boy aged 15. The second accuses the defendant of causing or inciting a boy to engage in sexual touching.

She has admitted one charge of causing a child to look at an image of sexual activity, not reasonably believing he was aged 16 or over, for the purpose of obtaining sexual gratification.

Clacton Coastal Academy is a 1,700-pupil co-education secondary school and sixth form that was rated as ‘requiring improvement’ in an Ofsted inspection last year.

The trial continues.
