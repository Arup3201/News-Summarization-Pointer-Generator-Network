Italy's former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi has finalised his divorce from Veronica Lario, leaving him free to marry a woman almost 50 years his junior.

Despite being younger than some of his children, Francesca Pascale, 28, now seems set to become the billionaire's third wife, with Italian media reporting she has already purchased a wedding dress.

The divorce comes five years after Lario, 57, said she could no longer tolerate the 77-year-old's 'consorting with minors' after spending 24 years married to the politician.

Although the divorce has been finalised, it is understood that Berlusconi and Lario and still in dispute the financial settlement, following a long and bitter legal battle.

A court initially awarded Lario, who has three children with Berlusconi, 
€3million a month but the amount was subsequently reduced to €1.4million
 after an appeal.

Lario has launched a counter appeal against that decision, with the final ruling yet to be delivered.

The divorce has hit Berlusconi's finances hard - a situation exasperated by a lack of dividends from his business empire Mediaset.

In January, Italian media reported that he had cut off monthly payments of €2,500 euros to a host of young models and dancers who attended his parties.

The women, known as "Olgettine" after the street in Milan where they lived in apartments paid for by Berlusconi, were heard on wiretaps calling for more cash, which they referred to as 'flowers' or 'fuel'.

In 2007 Berlusconi was quoted telling Miss Venezuela Aida Yespica (right): 'I'll go with you anywhere'. Last year he was convicted of paying Karima El Mahroug, also known as Ruby the Heartstealer (left), for underage sex

It was Berlusconi's colourful social life that drove Lario to divorce him.

She announced her separation from him in May 2009, saying in an open letter to the media that she could not 'remain with a man who cavorts with minors'.

It is now considered likely the 77-year-old will marry his current love interest, 28-year-old Pascale.

According to several gossip websites, including Dagospia, Berlusconi's girlfriend has already bought her wedding dress.

Pascale, rarely seen far from Berlusconi's side and often clutching a white dog, was recently quoted as saying she had to keep tabs on her boyfriend's out-of-control household spending.

Berlusconi is currently in the process of moving to a luxury apartment in central Rome where the rent will be less than the €2.1 million a year he pays for a palace nearby, according to La Repubblica.

He is currently embroiled in three court cases, and last week went on trial for allegedly bribing a senator.

The former premier is also appealing a prison sentence for having sex with an underage 17-year-old prostitute and abuse of office, and another for leaking a confidential police wiretap.
