Paris Saint-Germain might be going into their Champions League second leg against Chelsea as underdogs, but defender Maxwell thinks Chelsea got lucky in their previous 1-1 draw and hopes to reach the quarter-finals with a win on Wednesday.

Edinson Cavani levelled the tie at the Parc des Princes with his second-half strike cancelling out Branislav Ivanovic's away goal - and Chelsea certainly owed some of the credit for a decent result to goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.

Manager Jose Mourinho admitted as much, labelling the Belgian stopper as 'phenomenal' post-match - and now PSG defender Maxwell has spoken out, saying that he was what kept Chelsea in the tie in Paris last month.

'We played very well in the first leg and showed that we are capable of beating Chelsea,' the Brazilian defender said. 'They saved the result because of their goalkeeper.

'The first leg has brought us a lot of confidence and we head into the return leg looking to qualify.'

Courtois made three saves from PSG striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic in an almost perfect performance in Paris.

After the 1-1 draw, when asked whether Chelsea were let off the hook, his manager Mourinho said: 'When you see the performance of our goalkeeper, you have to say yes. He made two or three important saves in the game.

'I think 1-1 reflects one half for Chelsea, one half for Paris. But if you go to chances created and the goalkeepers' performances, we have to be honest and say they had more than us. If somebody was closer to winning the game, it was Paris and not Chelsea.' 

PSG fly to London on Tuesday hoping for better luck than in last year's away goals exit to the same opponents with a 2-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge following a 3-1 win in Paris. 

The French champions moved back to the top of Ligue 1 with a 4-1 win over Lens on Saturday. 

Courtois is likely to start again for Chelsea on Wednesday and may have to perform similar heroics
