The controversial high-speed rail project was plunged into further turmoil last night as the minister responsible for the scheme resigned to run for the post of deputy speaker.

Rail Minister Simon Burns quit ahead of David Cameron’s ministerial reshuffle next week in order to fight for the post vacated by Tory MP Nigel Evans – who was in court yesterday to answer rape charges.

His is the second major departure from the troubled scheme in as many months.

Last month the man responsible for promoting the scheme, HS2 chairman Douglas Oakervee, was replaced by Sir David Higgins – the former boss of Network Rail who masterminded the construction of the Olympic Park.

He will start in January on a £600,000 salary.

Mr Burns’ decision to walk out comes amid growing political opposition to the troubled project.

The future of the scheme is looking increasingly doubtful following predictions that the cost of the project, officially £50billion, could spiral to more than £80billion.

Quitting: Mr Burns did not mention HS2 in his resignation letter to David Cameron yesterday

Mr Burns did not mention HS2 in his resignation letter to David Cameron yesterday, but the Prime Minister replied: ‘It is no easy ask overseeing the roll-out of one of the Government’s flagship infrastructure projects, HS2 – one of our country’s most significant infrastructure projects for decades.

‘Your stewardship of our proposals has helped set the foundations of a project that will last for decades to come, a lasting legacy to your role as minister.’

MPs were last night relishing the prospect of voting for Mr Burns to spite Speaker John Bercow, with whom he has found himself clashing repeatedly.

Mr Burns was forced to apologise three years ago after branding the diminutive MP a ‘stupid, sanctimonious dwarf’.

In July this year Mr Bercow decided to hit back at Mr Burns while he was at the despatch box discussing HS2, saying: ‘The Minister of State is a slow learner.

'I gently advise him to raise his game and operate at the level of events.’

David Cameron has signalled that Mr Burns is his preferred candidate to take the deputy speakership, telling him in his letter: ‘Since you first entered the House of Commons you have been a parliamentary man through and through. I know you will continue to have a major influence in whatever you go on to do.’

Michael Fabricant, the Tory vice chairman, said: ‘Simon Burns resigns to stand for Deputy Speaker. He once called Bercow a sanctimonious dwarf. Simon’s got my vote!’
