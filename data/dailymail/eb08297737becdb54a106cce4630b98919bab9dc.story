A 15-year-old boy has been arrested in the shocking attack of a Pennsylvania schoolteacher seen on camera being sucker punched and left to lie unconscious in an alley.

The attack believed to have been completely at random shows 50-year-old Pittsburgh teacher James Addlespurger walking down the alley about 3.30pm last Thursday when he's unexpectedly hit from his left side.

Taken from a surrounding building's surveillance camera is footage capturing the attack that helped police make an arrest on Tuesday.

Unsuspecting: Jim Addlespurger was walking down an alley near his school in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, when he was attacked last Thursday

Brutal: One teen suddenly stepped into Mr Addlespurger's path and sucker-punched him without warning

Out cold: The English teacher dropped to the ground and bashed his head on a curb. He fell so quickly, he didn't even attempt to catch himself with his hands

Mr Addlespurger, who teaches 10th and 12th graders at Creating and Performing Arts School,
was walking in the other direction of the 15-year-old suspect and a 
group of five other boys and did not appear to interact with the youths 
in any way.

At the last second the suspect suddenly slid beside Addlespurger from his group and punched him in the head.

The
teacher fell hard onto a curb as the teen and the others continued 
walking, appearing to laugh and point at his lifeless body.

'We
don't know the mind state that that young man was in, but there's 
something very terrifying about it,' said Pittsburgh Councilman R. 
Daniel Lavelle, whose district includes downtown. 'In the video it 
appears he was laughing afterwards, which is very disturbing.'

Grandstanding: The teens seem to laugh and celebrate the unprovoked attack as they walk away from the unconscious teacher

The suspect was taken to a juvenile 
detention center on a charge of simple assault but was not identified 
because he's charged in juvenile court.

The suspect attends a school for troubled youths in another part of the city.

City schools spokeswoman Ebony Pugh 
said she can't comment on any discipline the student may face and isn't 
sure school officials will exercise any jurisdiction because the attack 
happened off school grounds and after the school day had ended.

Police said there's no evidence the suspect, or his friends, knew Mr Addlespurger or exchanged words with him.

Mr Addlespurger didn't immediately 
return a call for comment, but has said on Facebook and in brief 
comments to reporters that he's recovering and that 'the video pretty 
much speaks for itself.'
