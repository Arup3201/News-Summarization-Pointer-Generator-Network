For many women, pregnancy is a joyful time. But for Jenna, a mother-of-one from southern California, the experience proved to be tougher than she ever could have imagined.

Instead of happily preparing for the arrival of her second child, Jenna, who was diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder at the age of 12, was plagued with anxiety and paralysed by her fear of getting ill - a fear that left her a virtual recluse.

Now the brave mother has appeared on TLC documentary, Pregnant and OCD, to reveal what living with constant anxiety while expecting is really like.

Nerves: Jenna, pictured while pregnant with her second child, was left a virtual recluse because of OCD

'My OCD was first diagnosed when I was about 12 or 13 years old,' she explains. 'My thoughts and worries are always there - they're constant.

'I have a fear mostly of illness, so I avoid going out for fear of picking up one of the illnesses that are going around.'

As a result, Jenna spends most of her time at home and refuses to let her two-year-old son Dominic go to the park for fear of germs.

'We spend most of the days in the house,' she reveals. 'Most mothers love bringing their kids to the park but I think about the germs that are on [the slide] and that shoes have touched it. To me, the park represents a dirty place.'

For husband Josh, Jenna's OCD and the impact it has on their son is a constant source of concern.

Fearful: Jenna's fears include a terror of illness and of dirt, and as a result, she constantly washes her hands

Uncomfortable: Jenna, pictured with mother Gloria, was unable to enjoy her baby shower for fear of illness

'The OCD is a lot worse [since she became pregnant] and it's really 
stressful,' he explains. 'She's turned Dominic into a bubble boy and she doesn't really
 want him doing anything.

'He doesn't understand what's going on in Mummy's head.'

'I would definitely say the 
OCD has kept me in a prison,' adds Jenna. 'My thoughts and my fears that have to do 
with OCD become much worse with pregnancy.

'I've pretty much confined myself to the house except for when I need to go out. I worry about diseases like the Swine Flu. I wash my hands too many times to count.'

Although Jenna usually takes medication to control her symptoms, she refused to do so while pregnant - an attitude that also extended to the period spent breastfeeding when baby son Damien was born.

'Newborns are less protected so I worry 
about all that stuff,' she explains. 'I don't want to breastfeed and take that 
medication at the same time.

Concern: Since becoming a mother for the second time, Jenna has vowed to start taking medication again

Frightening: Jenna's OCD has made her reluctant to allow interaction between her two young sons

'The doctors say that lots of people do and 
they're fine but I'm unsure.'

Her OCD even has an impact on the interaction she allows between her sons, with Dominic regarded as a potential source of infection.

'When
 Dominic is interacting with Damien, I don't really like him to touch 
his face with his hands,' she admits. 'He might have germs on his hands.'

Since having Damien, however, the mother-of-two has made it her mission to overcome the disease for the sake of her sons and has started a new course of medication - despite being fearful of the effect it could have on her children.

'I want to get better and I'm trying to,' she explains. 'I hope that when the medication starts working, I'm going to feel a lot happier and less anxious.'

Normal: Jenna and husband Josh are desperate to give their sons as normal an upbringing as possible

'When she was pregnant I didn't think it could get any worse than what it was before, but it has,' adds husband Josh.

'I hope Dominic and Damien will be able to do what other boys do and go 
outside and get dirty and messy like little boys do.'

'I
 don't want my boys to see the world as a place that's full of threats,' says Jenna. 'I
 don't want them to worry about things like I do.

'I want them to see the
 world as a good place and I just want them to be happy.'
