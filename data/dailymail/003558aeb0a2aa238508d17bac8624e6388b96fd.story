A cat survived a six-mile journey perched on the boiling metal of a van's engine. 

The Persian cat, nicknamed Penelope, was discovered by the driver under his bonnet after noticing a burning smell yesterday morning.

Penelope who is now being treated for burns and a fractured jaw, is thought to have fallen from a height before ending up in the van.

Homeless: The Scottish SPCA is now looking to reunite her with her owner

The man started off on his journey just 
off London Road in Edinburgh and it is believed the cat may have 
recently gone missing from her home in the area.

The Scottish SPCA is now looking to reunite her with her owner.

Steph Grant, animal rescue officer, said: 'Penelope has sustained burns to the pads on her feet and part of her coat is singed.

'She also has a fractured jaw and cut under her chin as well as a missing tooth, so we think she may have fallen from a height and hit her face on the ground shortly before climbing inside the engine.

'Penelope is receiving antibiotics for her burns and has had her jaw wired.

'She's doing well and has proven to be very friendly and good-natured.

'It could be that Penelope is a house cat and isn't used to being outdoors so she went inside the engine for warmth and shelter.

She said the charity hoped that due to her distinctive coat she would be recognised and claimed by her owners.

'Penelope's owner must be very worried and we'd love to return her home after her frightening ordeal.'
