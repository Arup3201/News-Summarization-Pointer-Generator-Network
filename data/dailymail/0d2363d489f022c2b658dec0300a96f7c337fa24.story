Will Keane started the night with high hopes and finished it bloodied and goalless.

The Old Trafford door may be shut on the young striker but he has been on the most-wanted list as far as the Championship is concerned.

Wednesday manager Stuart Gray succeeded in sweet-talking Manchester United into borrowing the 22-year-old in the hope that it would herald a change in fortune at home.

On this evidence, Keane, who spent spells on loan at QPR and Wigan last season, needs a match or two to re-acclimatise but still had some good touches before his departure holding a cloth to the left side of his face.

Pin-pointing Wednesday’s weak spot this season does not require very much detective work. A glance at the ‘goals for’ column provides an instant clue to the team’s poor home record.

Three wins at Hillsborough and seven measly goals from 14 matches is the damning statistic.

Midfielder Lewis Baker has also arrived from Chelsea, to add more Premier League oomph to the South Yorkshire club.

The first half turned out to be the same old story, however, with Wednesday making chances and failing to take them.

Best opportunities in the first half fell to Jacques Maghoma and Atdhe Nuhui while Birmingham could have snatched the lead when Clayton Donaldson’s shot was deflected over the bar.

Birmingham were always going to be hard to break down. When boss Gary Rowett replaced sacked Lee Clark the team were second from bottom of the Championship and looking at nothing more than survival. 

At kick-off on Tuesday night, Birmingham were 11th and at Hillsborough on the back of four wins, one draw and just one defeat in six League matches.

They needed to be compact and organised with Wednesday making the early running, especially the busy Nuhiu, who helped set up Maghoma and then forced a last-ditch clearance with a shot across goal.

It will take time for Nuhiu and Keane to build up an understanding but their styles suggest they should complement each other.

Certainly Nuhiu’s physical presence caused most problems on Tuesday night although Birmingham showed great defensive qualities to stand firm.

The pitch did not help either side. There have been two significant snow falls in South Yorkshire in recent weeks, which gave it a pallid look. Pre-match sprinklers turned the heavy surface into a sticky, gluey mess too.

Birmingham manager Gary Rowett could not nick a win at Hillsborough but left with a point

It would be a tad cruel to suggest the football was similar. In fact, there were some close shaves and decent moves although not many.

Andrew Shinnie tried one long-range shot which went over the bar but it was Birmingham’s defenders who were far the busier.

Chris Maguire shaped up for a free kick in the second half which looked like it had gone in from one angle. Home fans’ cheers were ended abruptly.

And at the final whistle, the cheers were replaced by boos but even that was half-hearted.
