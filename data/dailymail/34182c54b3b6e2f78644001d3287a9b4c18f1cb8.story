Police say a Nebraska mom who disappeared last month with her son strangled the 10-year-old boy before strangling herself in the woods of an Iowa state park.

Council Bluffs police said Monday that Charlotte Schilling, 41, of PlattsmouthÂ  and her son, Owen, both died after being strangled with plastic cords in a murder-suicide.

The Schillings were missing from May 10 until their bodies were found May 20 in Lake Manawa State Park, south of Council Bluffs in western Iowa, about 20 miles north of Plattsmouth.

Gone: Charlotte Schilling, 41, checked her son Owen, 10, out of his elementary school on May 10 to go camping and had not been heard from since

Council Bluffs police say Charlotte Schilling tried to commit suicide with a plastic cord in November, but a family member intervened then.

Police believe she strangled her son first and then herself with the cord.

Council Bluffs Police Sargeant Chad Meyers said Schilling actually lost consciousness during her previous suicide attempt, and a family member heard her fall.

Unusual: The night before she disappeared Charlotte told a neighbor she didn't feel well and had fallen and bumped her head. But her husband said nothing was out of the ordinary

That time, however, someone was able to cut the cord off Schilling's neck quickly enough for her to recover.

Investigators said friends described behavior in the days before Schilling disappeared with her son as consistent with someone contemplating suicide.

For instance, Mr Meyers said Schilling gave away some of her personal belongings.

'Individually, each one of these people probably wouldn't have known anything was different,' he said.

'When you put it all together and look at it, it paints a pretty clear picture of someone who is contemplating suicide.'

The night before the woman and boy 
went missing, another neighbor, Athena Meneses, said she spoke to 
Schilling at a local Cub Scout meeting, where Meneses had taken her own 
son and Owen. Owen had wanted to join the group, Meneses said.

'I
didn't really know her very well, but she seemed upset. She had a bump 
on her head," Meneses said of Schilling. "She didn't seem like she was 
really happy that night. She said she wasn't feeling well and that she'd
like to go home. She told me that she had fallen down earlier that 
day.'

Relatives have said it wasn't unusual for Schilling to surprise her children with short road trips to parks, zoos and other nearby attractions. But the woman always called home and past excursions never lasted long.

Her family grew worried when neither she nor Owen returned home, and Schilling's cellphone went unanswered.

Charlotte's daughter, Lindsay 
Schilling, 20, said that is when she became concerned. 'I called until 
her phone died - every minute,' she told KETV.com. 'The fact that she didn't pick up mine - that's when it hit me: there's something wrong right now.'

Investigators believe the bodies of Charlotte and Owen Schilling had likely been lying in the woods near Lake Manawa since May 10 when Schilling checked Owen out of Wade Robin Elementary School in Bellevue, Neb. But police cannot determine the exact date of their death.

Police found Schilling's vehicle at the park where the mother and son's bodies were later found. Schilling's cellphone and wallet were in her car, about a half-mile from where the bodies were found.

Authorities had to rely on autopsy results to confirm the identities because of decomposition.

Mystery: Police have not ruled out the possibility of a murder-suicide in the deaths of Charlotte Schilling, left, and her son Owen, right

Sunday night a passerby saw two decomposed bodies found at Lake Manawa State Park . After an autopsy officials confirmed on Tuesday that they were the mother and son

Schilling and her son were last seen in surveillance video from a convenience store near the park.

The
video showed Owen hugging his mom, and Schilling kissing her son on the
head, and the clerk said nothing seemed unusual in the store.

Cody Johnson, a clerk at the Lake 
Manawa convenience store where surveillance video captured Schilling and
her son shortly after she checked him out of school, was one of the 
last people to see them alive.

Schilling bought a pack of cigarettes for herself, and apple juice and snacks for Owen.

'The
kid came in all hyper, like a normal kid would be, and went around 
looking at stuff,' Johnson said. 'Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. 
They were just like any other mom and son. There was nothing that showed
me anything bad was going to happen.'

Meyers
said some of the items that were purchased at the convenience store 
were found partially consumed near the bodies in the woods.

There was no sign of a struggle.
