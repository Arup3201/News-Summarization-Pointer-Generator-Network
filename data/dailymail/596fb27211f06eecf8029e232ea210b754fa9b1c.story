Passengers on an aircraft flying out of JFK had to deal with the scariest of sights just after take off.

The cabin of a Delta Airlines plane began to fill with smoke as the aircraft began its climb on one of the hottest days of the year.

Soon afterwards, the plane began to shake violently as it encountered turbulence.

Passengers were told to stay in their seats, but it didn't stop some travelers from taking pictures of the troubling sight.

Glow sticks required: Smoke began to fill the cabin of this Delta Airlines plane and it didn't dissipate until the aircraft had reached cruising altitude

One Reddit user Ficcolo posted the picture stating: 'Last night flying out of JFK....this happened and freaked us out. Disco rave flight!'

The fog in the cabin began to appear whilst the aircraft was on the ground and remained until the plane had reached cruising altitude.

Once the plane hit rough air on an otherwise clear summers evening, the worry that some passengers felt can be seen from the picture Ficcolo snapped.

Feeling their concern, the Captain decided to offer the entire planeload of passengers free alcoholic drinks. The airline normally charges up to $7 for such luxuries.

'I was grateful for my tiny bottles of vodka and juice. Worst turbulence ever after such a long Tarmac stay and fogging,' Ficcolo wrote.

Smoke on a plane: The fog seemed to form on takeoff from JFK on one of the hottest days of the year

Although the fog in the cabin appeared to rise up to the chest level of many passengers, it became apparent that it was due to the hot 90 degree weather New York has been experiencing, coupled with an air conditioning system malfunction.

However, basic science is able to explain the appearance of the fog in the cabin: hot humid air outside mixing with cool conditioned air from inside the plane, and the mist begins to form.

As the plane takes off, the air pressure in the cabin decreases. The temperature of the air also decreases and if it is rapid enough the air will cool enough for the water in the air to condense instantaneously, forming the fog that the passengers witnessed.

Nothing dangerous, but still unnerving when flying at 35,000 ft.
