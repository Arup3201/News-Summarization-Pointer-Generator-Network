The National Union of Teachers (NUT) yesterday passed a resolution at its annual conference in Torquay seeking fresh walkouts as early as this summer amid concerns over changes to public-sector pensions.

It came just hours after  the NASUWT conference  in Birmingham agreed to escalate its industrial action campaign – raising the possibility of strikes in the autumn term.

NASUWT treasurer Brian Cookson said there had been an ‘unprecedented, vicious, prejudiced and totally unjustified attack on the public sector’. He added:  ‘As teachers we are supreme professionals and we must be treated as such.’

A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘It is absurd to say our school reforms are a “vicious assault” on the teaching profession. We are putting power back into the hands of talented heads and teachers.’

The NASUWT is likely  to need a fresh ballot of members to carry out strike action. The NUT balloted its members last spring.

Pupils and working parents face added 
disruption later in the year from further industrial action aimed at 
derailing plans to scrap national pay rates and step up 
performance-related pay for teachers.

It is unclear exactly when industrial action will begin - although it could be as early as next term.

The NASUWT resolution says: 'Conference is committed to further extending the current national action instructions to restore teachers' professionalism by attacking policies and practices which deprofessionalise teachers, including punitive fallout from the inspection and accountability regimes.'

NUT general secretary Christine Blower: 'Our dispute is with the Secretary of State'

Speaking ahead of the debate, NASUWT 
general secretary Chris Keates said: 'The NASUWT has been in continuous 
action short of strike since December 2011 in an attempt to get the 
Government to focus on the real concerns of the profession and realise 
the effect their attacks are having, not just on teachers and their 
ability to do their job, but also on children and young people.'

She added: 'Teachers do not feel 
there is any area of their working lives the Government has not trampled
over and it is impairing their ability to focus on raising standards 
for pupils.

'If the Government commits to 
engaging constructively with the NASUWT there should be no need to move 
to further industrial action but we have reached a point where we feel 
we have no choice but to take steps to defend teacher professionalism 
from these attacks.'

The NASUWT was the first teaching union to pass a resolution calling for further industrial action over government reforms.

Then the National Union of Teachers (NUT), which met for its annual conference in Torquay yesterday, discussed a priority motion  on government changes to public
sector pensions.

The motion, heard in private, could pave the way for fresh walkouts as early as this summer.

It instructs the executive to 'seek 
to build a coalition of unions committed to further strike action in the
summer term and beyond to defeat the Government's proposals'.

And it calls for a discussion with 
those unions about 'all possible forms of joint strike and non-strike 
action, including national, regional and selective strike action, and 
campaigning activities such as joint national and local demonstrations 
and public meetings'.

Head  teachers are letting bright children get away with bad behaviour because they fear that excluding them will affect their schools’ position in league tables, it has emerged. 

Last year, teaching union NASUWT launched 12 ballots in schools over ‘poor management’ which had an ‘adverse effect’ on teaching and led to ‘general poor behaviour’ in classes. 

Reasons for the ballots included bright  pupils not being excluded because ‘the  school needs their results so can’t afford to let them be out’.

NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates said: ‘What you will often get with brighter pupils is... they will make comments to teachers like, “my mother will complain and you will lose your job”.

The brighter pupils will often engage in far more back chatting with the teacher.’

The NUT, along with a number of other
trade unions, has been embroiled in a row with the Government over 
public sector pensions for more than a year.

It took part in a walkout over 
pensions on June 30 last year, as well as joining the TUC's national day
of action on November 30. NUT members in London also staged a one-day walkout last month.

Earlier this year the NUT, along with
some other teaching unions including the University and College Union, 
declined to accept the Government's latest pensions offer.

Renewed action over the summer term 
would coincide with the main exams period, when teenagers across the 
country take qualifications such as GCSEs and A-levels.

The NUT insisted that it was not the union's intention to disrupt exams season.

'Our dispute is with the Secretary of
State, and ultimately, with the rest of the Government in terms of 
public sector pensions,' NUT general secretary Christine Blower said.

'We will obviously, when we discuss 
with other unions, discuss what timing makes sense and which regions 
make sense, but we would not be setting out, deliberately, to undermine 
the exams season.'

The Association of Teachers and Lecturers is the only one of the big three teaching unions to accept the Government’s proposals.

NUT figures suggest that a teacher 
with ten years of experience, working in inner London, will lose an 
extra £49 a month from April, rising to £123 a month by April 2014.

A teacher with the same experience 
outside London will lose  £30 a month from this April, rising to £74 a 
month from April 2014.

This weekend’s conference debated further 
strike calls over pay, workload and Coalition plans to increase spot 
checks of teachers to improve their performance.

A Department for Education spokesman said the teachers' pensions deal is 'as good as it gets'.

'It guarantees teachers one of the best pensions available but keeps a lid on rising costs for the taxpayer,' he said.

'We've been in serious talks for 
months with unions to address their concerns and reach a final 
settlement. Reforms to public sector pensions are essential - the status
quo is not an option.'
