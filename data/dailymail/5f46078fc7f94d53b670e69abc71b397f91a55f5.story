Dead: Police are still investigating how the bodies of Doyle, 88, and Lillian Chumney, 79, ended up dead in their burnt vehicle on a remote dirt road 30 miles away from their burglarized home

Burnt outline: All that remained of the car was a burned outline of where it once stood with the dead elderly couple inside, the cause of death still a mystery 

Burglarized: the couple's home was ransacked just days before they were discovered dead 30 miles away 

News Net 5 reports that on Friday morning the Coshocton County Coroner positively identified the bodies and that they will be sent over to Licking County Coroner for full autopsies.

Police removed the vehicle from the scene on Thursday evening but what remained was a ghostly burnt outline of where the car once stood on the narrow and muddy country road.

The couple was reported missing on Wednesday after they failed to pick up their son to take him to the airport.

When the couple's eldest daughter went to check on her parents she found their vehicle missing and their home ransacked. Drawers were opened and items were missing.

The couple was last heard from during a phone conversation on Tuesday evening at 11:00 pm and disappeared sometime between then and Wednesday morning.

Towed away: The burnt vehicle is seen being towed away after the missing Ohio couple's bodies were discovered mysteriously dead inside

Police told News Net 5 that the investigation is ongoing and they are not releasing more information at this time but that people should stay attentive to their surroundings and be on the watch for any suspicious characters. 

Residents of Bakersfield told reporters they were shocked and horrified by the alleged murder.

'It makes you stick to your stomach. Nobody deserves that,' said one neighbor.

'And whoever did this is evil I hope their caught because they don't deserve to be out in society,' said a resident of Bakersfield who was too afraid to show her face, especially with a suspect still on the loose.

After the home was burglarized neighbors held a candlelight vigil for the missing couple. 

'You can't say it doesn't happen in a town like this, but it just doesn't happen in a town like this,' said another neighbor. 

One woman said whoever the suspect is might know the area of Bakersville well since the road was small and only natives might know where it is.  

Troubled: This Ohio resident said the alleged murder made her sick to her stomach and said nobody deserves what happened the elderly couple and her neighbors agreed
