A Nevada woman who returned home to find an abandoned puppy outside her door was disgusted when she reviewed security camera footage and found that the dog had been cruelly left behind.

Toni Luisi of Henderson, Nevada, has released the heartbreaking footage in a bid to help find the dog – who she has named Graci - a loving home and shame the owner who abandoned her.

‘I mean, how do they treat their children if this is how they treat their dog?’ said Luisi.

A Nevada woman who returned home to find an abandoned puppy outside her door was disgusted when she reviewed security camera footage and found that the dog had been cruelly left behind

'How do they treat their children if this is how they treat their dog?' Luisi said she was alarmed when she reviewed the CCTV footage

Luisi returned home on May 5 to find the distressed puppy loitering around outside the gates of her home.

Initially she thought the dog must belong to someone nearby, but when she reviewed the video footage she was shocked at what she saw.

An SUV had slowly driven into the cul-du-sac where she lives and then let the animal out before quickly driving off while the confused puppy tried to follow.

‘I just feel really bad that someone could actually just open the car door and just dump this beautiful animal,’ Luisi told KTLA.

Graci is a Labrador mix who is about six months old and has a friendly nature

Chase in vain: Graci tries to follow after her owner's SUV but can't keep up as they increase their speed

Luisi took Graci, who is a Labrador mix, to the vet to get a rabbies shot and they established that she is about six months old.

Now rather than return the dog to whoever dumped her, Luisi is seeking an owner in the Las Vegas area as she already has two dogs of her own.

‘We’re gonna keep her as long as we can,’ said Luisi.

‘I mean, it would be better, because she’s so young, to get into a stable environment now so that people can get used to her, train her the way they would like her to be trained. But I’ll keep her until… we find a good home.’
