Emergency workers in Los Angeles who staged a dramatic rescue of a dog from a swollen river this week are now focused on a second part of the operation - finding the animal's owner.

Little 'Lucky' fell into the river near the Warner Bros. studios in Burbank, but was quickly swept downstream at least three miles following a sudden downpour, ending up in Glendale.

There, a Warner Bros. employee spotted the seven-year-old Shiba Inu flailing in the water and notified authorities.

Firefighters chose to do an air rescue because of how choppy the river was, NBC4 reported.

Dramatic rescue: The Los Angeles Fire Department staged an air rescue for a dog named Lucky who was swept away by a rushing river in Burbank this week

Plucked: The firefighter, John Terrusa, was lowered into the river and able to grab Lucky

Safety: The two were then pulled up and out of the river, which was unusually swollen from a downpour

Lucky: The dog, a seven-year-old Shiba Inu, is yet to be claimed

Firefighter John Terrusa was lowered into the river to pluck out Lucky.

'It was quite a team effort, quite a concert,' Terrusa told NBC4.

A group of firefighters were waiting at the river bank with towels to dry off Lucky once he and Terrusa made it safely to shore.

Lucky was then checked out by a vet and, despite a leg injury, was in good condition.

However he was not micro-chipped.

Soggy: Despite a bit of shock and a minor leg injury, Lucky was fine

Loved: Rescue workers say all signs point to Lucky being a well-cared for pet

Help needed: If no one claims the dog by Thursday, he'll be put up for adoption

No one has come forward to claim Lucky.

He is currently recuperating  in a Los Angeles shelter.

Lucky will be kept at the shelter for seven days, in the hope his owners will be found before then.

Otherwise he will be put up for adoption.

Someone has already offered to take Lucky in.

However Terrusa is confident he is a pet and that Lucky will be returned to his home. 

'It is definitely a loved animal,' Terrusa told the network. 

'It's just one of those things where I'm sure the dog just got out of somebody's yard and got in the wrong place, at the wrong time.'
