It's time to hang up your heels ... because slippers are big news this season.

Not the kind of slippers you pair with pyjamas, mind you - even if Oprah and Nicki Minaj have both been spotted in public wearing warm, fuzzy house shoes - these shoes are different.

The velvet 'smoking slipper' is highly structured and embellished – and while they used to be worn only by the likes of Hugh Heffner, times have changed and the fash pack are now racing to get their hands on a pair of sensible shoes.

Why the buzz? It’s an incredibly 
versatile shoe. Also called the ‘slipper loafer’ and ‘slipper flat’, it 
offers respite from the agony of towering heels, all the while providing
a grown up, edgy feel to the traditional slipper silhouette.

For Prada's Spring/Summer 2013 collection, 
Miuccia Prada unveiled a line of ornate slipper loafers, 
trimmed with sequins and rhinestones.

And Christian Louboutin's studded slippers have been a must-have style for several seasons.

The shoe is equally as popular with 
men as it is with women: Kanye West and Scott Disick are just as likely to be seen in them as Sarah Jessica Parker and Beyonce.

And the shoe's comfy, to boot. Both Alexa Chung and Pixie Lott have been seen arriving at Heathrow airport in velvet pumps.

Pixie, renowned for her daring sartorial choices, and Alexa, frequent winner of the British Style Awards, are the ultimate taste-makers and know exactly how to match comfort with sophistication when en route.

In West Hollywood, American model, socialite, and mother-to-be Amber Rose was caught leaving a nail salon in a pair of blue and white striped rhinestone £832 slippers by Giuseppe Zanotti.

Lindsay Lohan chose the highly-coveted £695 Christian Louboutin Intern 
Studded and Striped slippers for a trip to LAX airport and Victoria's Secret model Miranda 
Kerr spruced up her grungy, distressed jeans with her 
classic crimson slippers.

Olivia Palermo took her bright yellow outfit for a spin in a Brooklyn park, white pooch and boyfriend in tow. Palermo's initials on the front of the shoe lending a nice personalised touch to the trend (you can get yours monogrammed, too, at SchoShoes Milano).

And Anne Hathaway loves her £465 Charlotte Olympia cute 'Kitty Flats' while Abbey Clancy's stunning red velvet pair popped against the dark, muted tones of her outfit.
