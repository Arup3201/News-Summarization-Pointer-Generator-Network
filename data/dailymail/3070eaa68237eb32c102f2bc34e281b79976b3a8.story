One of Britain's leading scientists has hit out at Chinese researchers who created new strains of a killer flu virus in a bid to develop vaccines.

They claim the 'hybrid' flu, which mixes bird flu virus with human flu, could escape the lab and lead to a global health crisis pandemic killing millions of people.

It comes amid rising fears of a flu epidemic as China struggles to contain an outbreak of the virus.

The Bird Flu Virus up close: researchers fear an experimental strain of the killer virus could escape from the Chinese lab that created it

Fears over hybrid flu escaping led to scientists imposing a voluntary moratorium on their H5N1 research, banning transmission studies using ferrets.

However, researchers decided to lift the ban earlier this year, arguing that they have now consulted widely with health organisations and the public over safety concerns.

However, some scientists still oppose the work, saying any work is too dangerous and experimental strains could escape the lab.

Professor Hualan Chen, director of China’s National Avian Influenza 
Reference Laboratory at Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, deliberately mixed the H5N1 bird-flu 
virus, which is highly lethal but not easily transmitted between people,
with a 2009 strain of H1N1 flu virus, which is very infectious to 
humans.

The researchers claim the work could help develop a vaccine.

'The work of Zhang and colleagues provides a framework for further studies examining how the structure of the avian flu virus influences how readily it could transition to being a pathogen with human pandemic potential,' Science Express, the journal which published the research, said.

The study, which was carried out in a laboratory with the second highest
security level to prevent accidental escape, resulted in 127 different 
viral hybrids between H5N1 and H1N1, five of which were able to pass by 
airborne transmission between laboratory guinea pigs.

However, it is feared the mutated viruses could escape, sparking a global pandemic.

'They claim they are doing this to help develop vaccines and such like,' Lord May of Oxford, a former government chief scientist and past president of the Royal Society, told The Independent.

'In fact the real reason is that they are driven by blind ambition with 
no common sense whatsoever, and the record of containment in labs like this is not reassuring.

'They are
taking it upon themselves to create human-to-human transmission of very
dangerous viruses. It’s appallingly irresponsible,' he said.

It comes as experts warn human cases of a deadly new strain of bird flu that has killed 27 people in China are likely to crop up in Europe and around the world.

In his first media interview since returning from an international scientific mission to China last week, Professor Angus Nicoll, the head of the influenza and respiratory viruses programme at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), said the H7N9 flu outbreak in humans was one that should be taken extremely seriously and watched closely.

'We are at the start of a very long haul with H7N9,' Nicoll told Reuters in a telephone interview.

He said there were many scientific questions to be answered about the new flu strain, which was first detected in patients in China in March having been previously unknown in humans.

The flu has so far infected at least 127 people in China and killed 27 of them, according to latest data from Chinese health authorities and the World Health Organization.

Scientific studies of the virus have established it is being transmitted from birds - probably mostly chickens - to people, making it a so-called zoonotic disease that humans catch from animals rather than from other humans.

Nicoll, who visited Beijing and Shanghai last week with a team of international scientific experts, confirmed what the WHO has repeatedly said - that there is no evidence yet of the virus efficiently passing from person to person - a factor that would make H7N9 a serious pandemic flu threat if it were to evolve.

Nicoll said the 'most pressing public health question' for now was to identify the source of the circulating virus - the so-called 'reservoir' - that is leading to chickens contracting it and sporadically passing it on to humans.

This is likely to take time, with any results unlikely for several months.

He said the ECDC, which monitors disease in the European Union, and health authorities around the world should expect that 'imported cases' of H7N9 flu may well begin to crop up elsewhere.

Flu experts speaking at a briefing in London on Wednesday said those mutations, together with evidence that H7N9 is still mutating rapidly and probably spreading almost invisibly among birds because it does not make them obviously sick, meant this new flu was a 'serious threat' to world health.

'You can never predict anything about flu, but it is concerning to see those mutations there, Nicoll said. 'That's why it's important Europe should take this very seriously.'

Nicoll added that he thought the Chinese were doing an 'impressive job' handling, reporting, investigating and seeking to contain the outbreak.
