The NSA has claimed in a publicly-released document that it only reviews .00004% of Internet traffic on a daily basis. 

The seven-page document, titled 'The National Security Agency: Missions, Authorities, Oversight and Partnerships,' was released late Friday. It compares the amount of Internet data that the NSA collects to the size of a dime on a basketball court.

'According to figures published by a major tech provider, the Internet carries 1,826 Petabytes of information per day. In its foreign intelligence mission, NSA touches about 1.6% of that,' the agency states. 'However, of the 1.6% of the data, only 0.025% is actually selected for review. The net effect is that NSA analysts look at 0.00004% of the world's traffic in conducting their mission - that's less than one part in a million.

'Put another way, if a standard 
basketball court represented the global communications environment, 
NSA's total collection would be represented by an area smaller than a 
dime on that basketball court.'

The NSA denies claims that is has used foreign partners to get around U.S. laws.

'NSA partners with well over 30 different nations in order to conduct its foreign intelligence mission,' the agency states. 'In every case, NSA does not and will not use a relationship with a foreign intelligence service to ask that service to do what NSA is itself prohibited by law from doing.

'These partnerships are an important part of the US and allied defense against terrorists, cyber threat actors, and others who threaten our individual and collective security. Both parties to these relationships benefit.'

The document has no attribution or 
contact information. It is dated August 9, 2013 and was released on the 
same day that President Obama held a news conference about possible 
surveillance reforms.

In defense of its Internet-monitoring program, the NSA writes that the program was created in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, when the NSA 'did not have the tools or the database to search to identify [terorrist] connections and share them with the FBI.'

The paper concludes by stating that NSA personnel must report when they suspect the agency is overreaching or not acting within the law.

'This self-reporting is part of the culture and fabric of NSA,' the document reads. 

'We do not need to sacrifice civil liberties for the sake of national security; both are integral to who we are as Americans. NSA can and will continue to conduct its operations in a manner that respects both.'

Below are excerpts from the NSA's seven-page document on Internet surveillance programs:

'The National Security Agency: Missions, Authorities, Oversight and Partnerships

'In the wake of recent unauthorized disclosures about some of our key intelligence collection programs, President Obama has directed that as much information as possible be made public, while mindful of the need to protect sources, methods and national security. Acting under that guidance, the Administration has provided enhanced transparency on, and engaged in robust public discussion about, key intelligence collection programs undertaken by the NationalSecurity Agency (NSA). 

'This is important not only to foster the kind of debate the President has called for, but to correct inaccuracies that have appeared in the media and elsewhere. This document is a step in that process, and is aimed at providing a succint description of NSA's mission, authorities, oversight and partnerships.

'Prologue

'After the al-Qa'ida attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the 9/11 Commission found that the U.S. Government had failed to identify and connect the many "dots" of information that would have uncovered the planning and preparation for those attacks.

'We now know that 9/11 hijacker Khalid al-Midhar, who was on board American Airlines flight 77 that crashed into the Pentagon, resided in California for the first six months of 2000. While NSA had intercepted some of Midhar's conversations with persons in an al-Qa'ida safe house in Yemen during that period, NSA did not have the U.S. phone number or any indication that the phone Midhar was using was located in San Diego.

'NSA did not have the tools or the database to search to identify these connections and share them with the FBI. Several programs were developed to address the U.S. Government's need to connect the dots of information available to the intelligence community and to strengthen the coordination between foreign intelligence and domestic law enforcement agencies.

'Background

'NSA's challenge in an increasingly interconnected world - a world where our adversaries make use of the same communications systems and services as Americans and our allies - is to find and report on the communications of foreign intelligence value while respecting privacy and civil liberties.

'We do not need to sacrifice civil liberties for the sake of national security - both are integral to who we are as Americans. NSA can and will continue to conduct its operations in a manner that respects both.

'The Essential Role of Foreign Partners

'NSA partners with well over 30 different nations in order to conduct its foreign intelligence mission. In every case, NSA does not and will not use a relationship with a foreign intelligence service to ask that service to do what NSA is itself prohibited by law from doing.

'The Oversight and Compliance Framework

'NSA has an internal oversight and compliance framework to provide assurance that NSA's activities -its people, its technology and its operations - act consistently with the law and with NSA and U.S. intelligence community policies and procedures. This framework is overseen by multiple organizations external to the NSA...

'In addition to NSA's compliance safeguards, NSA personnel are obligated to report when they believe NSA is not, or may not be, acting consistently with law, policy, or procedure.
