Bond girls who had intimate relationships with the promiscuous 007 could have suffered lasting psychological damage, a senior judge has said.

Mr Justice Tugendhat made his comments when ruling on whether a compensation case brought by group of environmental activists, who discovered their former long-term partners were police spies, should go ahead.

The High Court judge compared the clandestine work of the undercover officers to James Bond, a well known fictional womaniser who uses women in the line of duty.

He said: 'James Bond is the most famous fictional example of a member of the intelligence services who used relationships with women to obtain information, or access to persons or property.

'Since he was writing a light entertainment, Ian Fleming did not dwell on the extent to which his hero used deception, still less upon the psychological harm he might have done to the women concerned.

'But fictional accounts, and there are others, lend credence to the view that the intelligence and police services have for many years deployed both men and women officers to form personal relationships of an intimate sexual nature, whether or not they were physical relationships, in order to obtain information or access.'

The activists are suing Scotland Yard for damages after discovering their former long-term partners were undercover police officers.

The 10 women, one of whom had a child with a police officer, are seeking damages for misconduct, deceit, assault and negligence.

Some them had relationships with Mark Kennedy, an officer who spent seven years spying on green activists posing as drop out climber Mark Stone.

An 11th person, a man, is also suing the police. It is believed his girlfriend left him for a police officer.

They all claim to have suffered serious personal injury including mental illness and ongoing distress.

Madeline
Smith, who played Bond girl MIss Caruso in the 1973 film Live And Let 
Die, said after the hearing she did not question at the time whether 
007's behaviour could cause harm.

She told The Telegraph: 'I was a dizzy, dippy little character in my frilly knickers, and that was OK then.

'It
was entertainment and I don't think anyone questioned it. With all 
films and computer games, there is a big danger of people crossing into 
fantasy or fiction from real life.'

Valerie
Leon, a star of the Bond films The Sky Who Loved Me and Never Say Never
Again, added: 'I think back then we didn't question it.

'Bond was what all women wanted and all men wanted to be. But we live in a different world now.'

Mr Justice Tugendhat ordered that a significant part of the case must be heard behind closed doors because it is so sensitive.

As
a result their claims will be considered by the Investigatory Powers 
Tribunal (IPT), which usually considers complaints against MI5.

Solicitor Harriet Wistrich, of 
Birnberg Peirce, said the decision means the women may never discover 
why they were ‘violated’ by the state.

She said: ‘This decision prevents both 
the claimants and the public from seeing the extent of the violations of
human rights and abuses of public office perpetrated by these 
undercover units.

'The claimants have already suffered a gross violation of their privacy and abuse of trust by the police.

'If the case is dealt with by the IPT they will be denied access to justice and may never discover why they were thus violated by the state.’

The move is the latest chapter in an extraordinary saga that has laid bare how police infiltrated protest groups across Britain and Europe over the last two decades.

Rejecting a bid by the Met to strike out the whole case, Mr Justice Tugendhat said the allegations are of the ‘gravest possible interference’ with the claimants’ private lives.

He said police have used deception before, including a woman police officer who befriended Colin Stagg when he was suspected of murdering Rachel Nickell on Wimbledon Common.

Monica Carss-Frisk QC, for the Met, said: ‘This case is not about denying remedy for any legitimate grievance. It is about the right forum for determining these claims.’

The IPT is so secret it does not even have an address, instead directing people to an anonymous PO Box in South London.

It was set up in 2000 by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, which governs how police use covert techniques and surveillance to investigate crime.
