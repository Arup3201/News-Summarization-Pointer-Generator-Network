You may have varying tastes when it comes to actors and singers you find attractive, but when it comes to real relationships, most people have a ‘type’.

Dating site Match.com is now offering a high-end service that uses image recognition software to specifically find new dates who fit this type, based on pictures of old flames.

Users are asked to send a photo of their ex so it can then be used to find matches with similar characteristics, such as face shape and characteristics.

The first facial recognition app for Google's Glass wearable computer launched in February - and it claims to be able to spot a perfect date in a crowded room.

It can scan the room, trying to match people with pictures takes from social networking and dating site, and the app's makers claim it can even check the sex offenders register before deciding on a match.

Called NameTag, it blurs the lines between online and offline dating by allowing smartphone users to simply glance at someone nearby, or take their photo, and instantly see that person's name, occupation and even visit their Facebook profile.

But finding a partner using the technology comes at price of $5,000 for a six month membership, On the Media reported.

The service is not currently available outside of the U.S, and MailOnline has contacted the company about a potential global rollout.

The technology is also not currently available for lesbian, gay and bisexual Match.com users.

This price does, however, include a dating coach who will meet up with users to talk about their ideal partner, and give tips on how to not blow the first encounter.

The dating site has partnered with a firm called Three Day Rule, to let its members upgrade to the Los Angeles-based company’s service and software.

Talia Goldstein, the founder of Three Day Rule, told Mashable: ‘People have a type and it's not necessarily about height or race or hair colour, but a lot of it is about face shape.’

‘I've noticed over my years in matchmaking that people have types.

'I always ask my clients to send me photos of their exes.'

She added that although many people claim to not have a type, ex partners usually have the similar facial structures, even if their skin colour, hair or height is different.

Although there aren't precise details on how Three Day Rule's technology works, facial recognition systems (illustrated) generally compare selected facial features from a photograph with a database. These algorithms typically map the relative size and shapes of features such as the eyes, cheekbones and chin

The company said it uses a hybrid approach to find people partners, combining in-depth personality assessments with the facial recognition technology.

Although there are not precise details on how Three Day Rule’s technology works, facial recognition systems generally compare selected facial features from a photograph with a database.

Some algorithms map the relative size and shapes of features such as the eyes, cheekbones and chin, which are used to search for other faces with similar characteristics.

And Match.com customers could choose the same service, complete with facial recognition technology in the coming weeks by upgrading to Three Day Rule’s package.

The people who have used the service tend to be wealthy and busy.

Those who sign-up to the $5,000 service let a professional matchmaker go on a ‘pre-date’ to check that a potential mate is not a waste of their time.
