His sparkling smile has already won him legions of fans and now Harry Styles' pearly whites have sparked a teeth whitening craze.

Not surprisingly, most of the newcomers to the beautifying treatment are teenage boys and young men, perhaps hoping to emulate the One Direction star's success with the ladies.

So potent is Styles' appeal, that sales of tooth whitening kits to men aged between 18 and 24 shot up by an incredible 500 per cent last year.

Something to smile about: Styles' pearly whites have sparked a 500 per cent increase in whitening treatments amongst young men

What's more, the heart-throb's appeal isn't just confined to young men who want a girlfriend.

According to tooth-whitening company, Pearlys, sales of its Professional Home Kit increased by 18 per cent across the board - all courtesy of the Styles effect.

A poll carried out by the company saw the singer revealed as the owner of the most envied set of gnashers in the country.

The Duchess of Cambridge took second place, while Jeremy Clarkson and TOWIE star, Chloe Sims, received the wooden spoon prize.

Pearlys founder Liz Ridley said: 'Women are dazzled by Harry's smile and young men want to have the same effect.

'Badly discoloured teeth are a complete turn off. 

'It’s not a surprise a heavy smoker like Jeremy Clarkson came top of the worst list, while those who took part in our survey obviously think Chloe Simms has had too much done to her teeth.'
