Switzerland is lobbying for the art of yodelling to be given Unesco World Heritage status.

The form of Alpine singing, which has existed since the 1830s, would be added to the Unesco World Heritage list alongside Stonehenge and the Taj Mahal, if the status is granted.

The request comes after the Argentinian tango was named a World Heritage tradition in 2009. Falconry and the Mediterranean diet have also been added to the list.

Tradition since 1830: Alpine horn blowers and yodelling chorus from the Geneva Swiss Alps canton of Valais

Traditionally, World Heritage status was only granted to buildings, monuments and places of natural beauty but in 2003, the category of ‘Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity’ was created.

The Swiss government has now asked for eight ‘intangible heritage’ traditions to be added to the prestigious list, The Daily Telegraph reported.

As well as yodelling, the Swiss have asked for, among others, mechanical watchmaking and managing the risk of avalanches to be given official status.

But they may have to wait eight years for the status to be granted as under current rules countries can only submit one ‘intangible heritage’ entry each year.

The yodel is a song sung with an extended note which rapidly and repeatedly changes in pitch and makes a high-low-high-low sound.

Developed in the Central Alps as a method of communication between mountaineers or between villages, the yodel later became part of the region's traditional lore and musical expression.

Most westerners of a certain age know it purely through a version of a song warbled by Julie Andrews in the classic Austrian-set musical The Sound of Music.
