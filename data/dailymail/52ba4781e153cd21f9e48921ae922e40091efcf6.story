A group of daredevil skiers has donned LED light suits to create a spectacular video of them taking to the slopes after dark.

Hailed as one of the most cinematically profound ski movies ever made, Afterglow features top athletes charging down snow-covered mountains in darkness... with just their custom-made LED suits to light the way.

The groundbreaking 11-minute labour of love was filmed over several weeks in both Alaska and British Columbia, Canada.

A partnership between Sweetgrass Productions, Philips TV and the Swedish Agency Ahlstrand & Wållgren, it's described as 'two parts creativity, one part branded content, and a pinch of masochism for good measure.'

The video follows skiers Pep Fujas, Eric Hjorleifson, Daron Rahlves, and Chris Benchetler, as they perform tricks deep in the Alaskan wilderness, leaving a trail of vibrant light and colour in their wake.

But capturing these mesermising shots was anything but easy.

With 14 people involved - and 9,000 lbs of equipment in tow - the video was an 'extreme logistical challenge.'

Filming between 7:30pm and 7:30am, the night temperatures dropped to a bitter -15 degrees Celsius, which meant that all camera rigs and lights had to be custom designed to handle the harsh climate.

But was it worth it? Definitely. 

The stunning cinematics are described as 'part creativity, part branded content and a pinch of masochism'
