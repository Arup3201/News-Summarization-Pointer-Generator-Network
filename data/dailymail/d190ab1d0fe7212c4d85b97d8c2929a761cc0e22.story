More than 64,000 pages of sensitive documents about the botched 'Fast and Furious' gun trafficking operation have been dumped on Congress following a court order that demanded their release.

The Justice Department handed 64,280 pages of documents to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee yesterday as it relented in its two-year battle to keep the information secret.

Documents in the 'election eve dump' relate to the notorious 'Fast and Furious' Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives (ATF) sting, in which Arizona field officers attempted to  track 2,000 illegally sold weapons across the border in the hope they would lead to arrests within the powerful Mexican drug cartels.

In 2012, Attorney General Eric Holder (pictured left) was found in contempt of Congress for failing to turn over the documents. President Obama had claimed the documents should not be handed over under grounds of 'executive privilege'

While straw buyers were arrested, many weapons remain unaccounted for.

Most notably, two of the guns were found at a crime scene just north of Mexico where U.S. border agent Brian Terry was gunned down by illegal immigrants in December 2010.

Republicans have now claimed the documents release is an admission by the Obama government that it had overstepped its legal boundaries, after failing to withhold them under executive privilege grounds.

Darrell Issa, the Republican chairman of the reform committee, said: 'When Eric Holder wants to know why he was the first Attorney General held in criminal contempt of Congress, he can read the judge’s order that compelled the production of 64,280 pages that he and President Obama illegitimately and illegally withheld from Congress.'

Although concerned about redactions within the files, he called it 'a victory for the legislative branch, a victory for transparency, and a victory for efforts to check executive branch power'.

But Brian Fallon, a Justice Department spokesman, told the Washington Times the release was part of a compromise it had long been attempting to reach with Congress.

He said: 'We have long been willing to provide many of these materials voluntarily in order to resolve this matter outside of court, and believe that producing them now should bring us a big step closer to concluding this litigation once and for all.'

Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry (pictured) was killed during an attack on him and three colleagues in 2010. Two rifles found at the scene were later revealed to have been tracked as part of Operation Fast and Furious

Border agent Mr Terry was killed when he and three other agents came under attack in a canyon north of the Arizona border by five gang members.

Two rifles found at the scene of the shooting were later discovered to be tracked by the ATF. They were purchased by a straw buyer for smuggling to a Mexican drugs cartel - revelations that led to a political furore in Washington.

Authorities declined to say whether the murder weapon in Mr Terry's death was linked to a purchase from the operation.
