Max Chilton is wary of the threat Sauber pose to Marussia's hopes of a constructors' championship high this season.

Ninth place may not sound much in the grand scheme of things, but to a team like Marussia such a position would effectively be as good as winning the title.

The Banbury-based marque are currently clinging on to ninth in this season's title race courtesy of Jules Bianchi ending the team's 83-race points drought in Monaco in May.

In a chaotic race Bianchi captured ninth place to spark jubilant scenes within Marussia, and set them up for another slice of history.

After finishing in the top 10 for the first time in their four years in F1 last season, Marussia could go one further this year.

Under F1's complicated prize-money structure, the financial rewards would also be considerable if Marussia could follow up with ninth on the back of their 10th spot in 2013.

The team head into F1's summer break knowing they have eight races to keep Caterham at bay, and especially Sauber, currently on their worst streak in the team's history in 11 races without a point.

'We'd love to hold them off,' said the 23-year-old Briton. 'But to do that we need to be finishing in front of them, and at the moment we're not doing that, so we're hoping in a race when points do become available, they're not in front of us.

'We're giving it our best shot, but without constant updates on the car it's hard to keep knocking on their door.

'Some races we're close, some we're not as close.

'Thankfully for us they're not closing the door on the teams in front of them.

'It's not like they're looking at points every race and they're just missing out. They're not there at the moment.

'Because they're not in a position where they can feel comfortable scoring points, it means we're not right on the edge of our seats.

'They need a bit of luck like we had.'

Adrian Sutil did come close to breaking Sauber's points duck in the Hungarian Grand Prix on Sunday, matching his best result of the year with 11th.

Sauber would certainly appear to be Marussia's main threat with Caterham struggling on and off the track.

Chilton feels a recent takeover of the team by a consortium of Swiss and Middle-Eastern businessmen will likely take time to bear fruit.

'They've gone through a lot of changes. I've heard stuff about people going and different people changing roles,' added Chilton.

'Like any sport, if you change people around it takes time for them to learn their new positions and communicate properly.

'It takes a bit of time for a team to settle down, so for us that's helping.'

Chilton, who remains hopeful of retaining his seat for next season, is still convinced he can score points of his own this year if given the right circumstances.

'I know I can do it, I just need to have the right opportunity to get it done,' said Chilton.

'I believe in my ability to score points. There are people who have scored points, and I know I can do it as well.'
