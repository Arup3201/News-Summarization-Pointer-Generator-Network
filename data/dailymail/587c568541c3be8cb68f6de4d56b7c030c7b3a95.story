Tony Pulis walked out on Crystal Palace on Thursday night, less than 48 hours before the start of the Premier League season.

The 56-year-old manager spent hours in a crisis meeting with Palace chairman Steve Parish following a row over the club’s transfer policy, before it was revealed that he had left by mutual consent.

However, it is understood that Pulis refused to carry on, in protest against the entire running of the club.

Pulis, who remarkably kept Palace in the Barclays Premier League last season after taking over in November when they had only four points, is believed to be devastated by the collapse of what he felt was a long-term plan to establish the club in the top flight.

Dave Kemp will take charge of the team at Arsenal on Saturday but will then also leave. Keith Millen will help him and stay on in a coaching role. Although former Stoke boss Pulis took training as usual on Thursday morning, Parish summoned him to their meeting at a central London location.

The pair’s relationship deteriorated in the summer over a difference of opinion about the type of players they wanted.

 The Premier League Manager of the Year wanted to be backed heavily in the transfer window, but Parish adopted a cautious approach because of the finance involved.

Pulis believed he had put together deals for Steven Caulker, Michu and Gylfi Sigurdsson but these did not materialise.

Palace went into administration twice because of a catastrophic transfer policy under former chairman Mark Goldberg and, more recently, Simon Jordan. Parish, who is one of four Palace fans with a 25 per cent share in the club, didn’t want to overstretch the budget.

Pulis took over from Ian Holloway at Selhurst Park last season when the club looked doomed to relegation, but they staged a remarkable recovery to finish in 11th place. 

Palace director of football Iain Moody is believed to want his former Cardiff boss Malky Mackay to take over from Pulis.
