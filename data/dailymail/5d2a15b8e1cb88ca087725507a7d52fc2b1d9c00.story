A woman has been caught on camera stabbing an on-duty police officer in the back with scissors.

Dash cam footage shows a woman, identified by police as 26-year-old Jessica Lugo, walking up to Fort Gibson cop Brent Maddocks and slashing him as he conducted a traffic stop on Tuesday night.

The disturbing video shows Lugo chaseing Maddocks, 25, as he tried to back from her near Whitlock Packaging at South Lee Street and Benge Road in Fort Gibson, Oklahoma.

'At first it just felt like somebody hit me,' Maddocks, who suffered a shoulder wound, told NewsOn6. 'She just started coming at me, slashing the scissors.'

Maddocks said he made a quick decision not to shoot, as a family-of-four - including two children - was sitting in the SUV he had just pulled over.

Instead, he used his Taser to stun Lugo.

Looking back at the shocking video, he said he was lucky to be alive following the unprovoked attack.

'It's an experience, and we take it, and we learn from it and we adapt and overcome,' Maddocks said.

Meanwhile, police are trying to work out what sparked the assault, as Maddocks said he had never met his attacker.

Lugo, who worked at Whitlock Packaging, was on a smoke break outside the warehouse before the attack.

Meanwhile, it is not clear when Maddocks will return to work. He is recovering from a puncture wound in the upper shoulder where his bulletproof vest provided no protection.
