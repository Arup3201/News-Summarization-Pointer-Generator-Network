On Tuesday night Cristiano Ronaldo broke the record for most goals in European competitions and   Oleksandr Kucher wrote his own name into the history books the following day.

Not that it was cause for celebration as the Shakhtar Donetsk defender was hit with the fastest red card ever in the Champions League.

Kucher was given his marching orders after just two minutes and 39 seconds when he brought down Bayern Munich's Mario Gotze in the penalty area, conceding a penalty and handing Shakhtar a mountain to climb.

There was minimal contact but Gotze hit the floor as he raced through on goal

Scottish referee Wille Collum deemed it a clear goalscoring opportunity and brandished the red card

The contact was minimal as the 32-year-old clumsily lunged toward the World Cup winning midfielder and Scottish referee Willie Collum reached for his top pocket.

The tie, delicately poised after a 0-0 draw in Ukraine three weeks ago, was effectively over for Shakhtar after Thomas Muller scored with the resulting penalty.

Bayern ran riot at the Allianz Arena as Jerome Boateng added a second for the German champions in the first half before Franck Ribery, Muller, Holger Badstuber, Robert Lewandowski and Mario Gotze completed a 7-0 rout on the night and on aggregate.
