A California couple has decided to end their 14-year marriage, not by divorce, but by uncoupling. 

Clark and Valerie Tate came together on a beach in front of their friends and 10-year old son, Jonah, to end their marriage in an 'uncoupling' ceremony, according to ABC News.

Taking a cue from Gwyneth Paltrow and ex-beau Chris Martin, the Tates have decided to avoid the messy, expensive process of divorce and have what is called a 'conscious uncoupling.'

'Uncoupling': Clark and Valerie Tate have ended their marriage not with a divorce, but an 'uncoupling'

Rings: In the ceremony, Clark and Valerie took off their wedding rings and gave them back to each other in the new age ritual

In the ceremony, Clark and Valerie took off their wedding rings and gave them back to each other in the new age ritual.

'These rings do not symbolize who we are to each other anymore,' Clark reportedly said in the ceremony.

'So we're releasing them,' Valerie added. 

By uncoupling, the Tate's no longer see themselves as being husband and wife -- though they technically are -- or romantically involved at all. That's about the only thing that will change in the lives of the two.

Both will continue to live in the same home, --  with separate bedrooms -- maintain joint assets, and raise their son Jonah together keeping their family unit in tact while openly dating other people.

Failing marriage: The Tates said that they began living as an 'uncouple' back in 2007 just five years after they began experience troubles

Clark: Clark, who had been married twice before, said that getting a divorce wasn't something he wanted to go through again

In an episode of ABC's Nightline,  the Tates said that their marriage began to fail, but divorce was never an option for them.

Their main priority is raising their son and they were determined to shield him from the effects of their failed relationship.

Clark, who had reportedly been married twice before told ABC News that getting a divorce wasn't something he wanted to go through again.

'We weren't considering really changing the structure of our family unit,' Valerie added.

Their recent uncoupling ceremony was not a spur of the moment decision, the Tates had opened up about their planning for a fall uncoupling ceremony to the New York Times back in August.  

The Tates told the Times that they began living as an 'uncouple' back in 2007 just five years after they began experiencing troubles.

The Times reports that in 2002 Clark had a major surgery and suffered the loss of his father who died that same year. When their son was born, Clark experienced added stress and Valerie felt neglected.

'I missed Clark,' Valerie told the Times. Clark said he had been 'myopically' focused on their son.

Dating: Valerie is in a serious relationship and Clark is dating, the two have unwritten rules regarding dating and have decided to only introduce serious partners to their son

The two reportedly went to therapy in 2005, but by 2006, the two were not intimate and Valerie asked if she could 'bring her romantic needs elsewhere.'

Clark and Valerie told ABC that Valerie is in a serious relationship and Clark is dating. They have unwritten rules regarding dating and they only introduce serious partners to their son. 

'We give each other private time,' Valerie said. 'Maybe Jonah and Clark are out of the house, or vice versa. But most of it is, private time is spent elsewhere.'

Clark said that the two are through their toughest times and are now in, what Valerie calls, 'the unknowns.'
