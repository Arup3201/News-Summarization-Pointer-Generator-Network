Speculation has been rife about how exactly Paris Hilton's little brother Barron received his injuries after allegedly being on the receiving end of a vicious attack in Miami on Friday.

And now, TMZ and Page Six have reported that New York writer Ray LeMoine was involved in the altercation.

Barron had originally accused Lindsay Lohan of 'masterminding' the alleged attack that reportedly left the 24-year-old requiring medical treatment for multiple face wounds. She has denied involvement.

Involved? Ray LeMoine, pictured here at an event in New York last year,  has been identified as allegedly getting into a fight with Barron Hilton at a mansion in Miami, Florida last week

Meanwhile, it has since been claimed by TMZ that Barron is now planning to sue both Lindsay and Ray for their alleged involvement in the attack.

Sources close to the family told the 
website that Paris had arranged a meeting with a lawyer on Saturday, at 
which she set things in motion for Barron to sue both Lindsay and Ray.

Law enforcement sources have also told TMZ that they are planning on arresting Ray over the attack, and that it will be happening 'soon'.

Barron posted a shocking photograph of his cut and swollen face on Saturday.

On Sunday, TMZ reported that police were seeking to speak to Ray about the incident.

After being identified by the 
website, the 31-year-old spoke out via his representative, claiming it 
was Barron who turned a verbal disagreement into something physical.

TMZ reported: 'A rep for Ray 
LeMoine...claims his fists only started flying after Barron refused to 
leave the house and says Paris Hilton's little brother got physical 
first.'

According to the website, the alleged
 fight occurred at a mansion Ray - who is a published author, journalist
 andrestaurateur - was renting on Friday.

The trouble began when 'a blitzed' Barron was asked to leave Lemoine's rented South Beach pad and refused, TMZ said.

'Barron was being totally cool, being respectful, funny, walking out,' a source told Page Six.

'Do you know who I am, who my sisters are?' Barron allegedly sneered to the former New York Times blogger.

Hilton then suddenly 'flipped' allegedly hitting Lemoine and Lemoine purportedly struck back, the source said.

According to Page Six, Lindsay was at the house at the time, and she's been 'dodging cops who want to talk to her.'

'I saw nothing,' the Liz & Dick actress told Splash News holding up her palms.

'I'm scared of the Hiltons and Paris' Cash Money crew [she 
has a record deal with the company], so I am seeking refuge in Cuba,' Ray's rep told  the Confidenti@l section of the New York Daily News.

'Castro hates the Hiltons and took 
their Havana hotel in 1959 as a base after conquering Cuba, so they are 
stoked I'm coming down to hate capitalism. Viva la Lohan!'

Ray has been published in numerous well-known publications including New York Magazine, The Guardian, and The Awl.

The downtown Manhattan-based writer 
is even a published author having co-wrote Babylon By Bus, about he and a
 friend's decision to stop selling 'Yankees Suck' T-shirts outside 
Fenway park, which allegedly netted them each a 'lawyer's salary' for 
five months of work a year - and headed to Iraq in 2003.

Managing to get jobs working for the 
US Government as part of the reconstruction effort, the the then 
20-somethings - who are described as ' two Valium-popping, 
hard-drinking...do-gooders' - engaged in a dangerous boys' own 
adventure.

Ray has reported on New York's 
nightlife and Lindsay was featured in at least one of his stories. 
However, it's unclear how they got acquainted.

Lindsay and Barron were reportedly 
'at loggerheads' at the party as Lindsay had accused him of talking 
about her to her boyfriend while at a Miami Art Basel event.

The troubled starlet remains in Miami
 for the annual art festival and posted a selfie in the Shore Club where
 she is staying. But Barron has since returned to his Bel Air home.

On Saturday the privileged heir posted on Instagram that he was with his mother Kathy saying it felt 'good to be home.'

Thicker than water: Paris Hilton has vowed to make those involved in the alleged attack on her brother Barron, seen here together in Utah earlier this year, 'pay'

The alleged feud between Lindsay and 
Barron appears to have re-ignited the tensions between the former gal 
pals, which has been simmering for years.

Late on Saturday, the former sex tape
 star angrily stepped up in support of her brother declaring the 
perpetrator will be made to 'pay.'

She broke her silence about the alleged attack by posting a comment on Barron's Instagram page.

Pictured on TMZ,
 the 32-year-old socialite wrote alongside an image of her younger 
sibling's battered face saying: 'They both will pay for what they did. 
No one f***s with my family and gets away with it!!'

Then, late Saturday night Lindsay 
followed suit, appearing to make reference to the alleged incident for 
the first time by posting an image of her at the Shore Club, saying she 
was having a great time with 'honest, fun friends...and no more bad 
folk.'

Now you see it then you don't: Lindsay made a vague reference to the alleged incident on Instagram on Saturday night but quickly deleted it just minutes after posting

The Mean Girls star deleted the post 30 minutes later.

Paris and her sister Nicky also made 
comments on their Twitter earlier on Saturday, which appeared to make 
reference to what allegedly happened between their brother and Paris's 
former party pal.

Nicky appeared to point the finger at
 Lindsay's friends, rather than the 27-year-old, while Paris turned to 
cosmic retribution writing: 'Karma's a b***h...'

Paris and Lindsay have a long history
 of being frenemies with the heiress being caught on film in 2006 making
 fun the Parent Trap star along with friend Brandon Davis - who 
infamously called Lindsay a 'firecrotch.'

MailOnline contacted representatives 
for both Lindsay and Barron about the alleged incident but they have so 
far been unavailable for comment.
