A decomposing body has been found in the trunk of a car that belonged to a missing man who was linked to a double murder on Christmas Eve.

Ilona Flint, 22, and the younger brother of her fiancé, Salvatore Belvedere, 22, were shot dead in their car outside a San Diego shopping mall on December 24.

Miss Flint's fiancé Gianni Belvedere, 24, has not been seen since the double homicide and had not been named as a suspect in the killings.

This weekend a man's body was discovered in the trunk of Mr Belvedere's green Camry, around 100 miles from where his fiancée and brother were shot. Police are yet to identify the body.

Police discovered the body of a man in the trunk of missing Gianni Belvedere's car this weekend after a passerby called about a strong odor

Witness Gabby Alcarez told ABC that she called police because '[T]he odor is pretty strong, like when I passed by it'.

A recently-released audio tape of a 911 call that Miss Flint managed to make before she died from her wounds gave police other details on a suspect. 

She told an emergency dispatcher that 
she didn't know precisely where she was but that she was near the 
Westfield Mission Valley Mall.

Both victims were hit in the head and torso as they sat in a black sedan outside a Macy's store in the early hours of Christmas Eve.

The audio tape identifies an individual who left the scene in a 2008/2011 dark gray Honda Civic.

San Diego police are baffled by the crime for which they have no motive and no suspects. 

The family of Miss Flint released a statement today which read: 'We consider Gianni Belvedere to be our 
son as much as the Belvederes consider Ilona to be their daughter.

'The Belvedere and Flint-Jones families thank the media
 for respecting our privacy during this difficult time.'

Lt
 Mike Hastings from the San Diego police department's homicide unit said
 in December that they are looking for a 5ft 9 to 5ft 11 male of unknown
 race, last seen dressed in a shirt and tan pants.

Anyone
 with information is asked to call the San Diego Police Department's 
Homicide Unit on (619) 531-2293 or San Diego County Crime Stoppers at
