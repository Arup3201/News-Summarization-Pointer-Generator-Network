Shrien Dewani surfed a gay dating website two days after his wife's murder - as her grieving father arrived to collect her body, his trial heard today. 

The millionaire is accused of arranging to have his wife Anni killed in a staged carjacking as they travelled through a notorious South African township on their honeymoon. 

The court heard he had surfed gay dating website Gaydar  as Mrs Dewani's grieving father, Vinod Hindocha, waited at the Cape Grace Hotel to collect his daughter's body two days after it was found.

He was signed into the website for nearly an hour and left his computer on and still connected when he joined Mr Hindocha in the hotel lounge. 

The court also heard that Dewani had declared himself gay, rather than bisexual, on the site.

Dewani has admitted having sex with male prostitutes and men he has met online and in clubs, although he previously told the trial that he is also attracted to women and loved his wife.

But Simon Johnson, a former digital product manager for Gaydar, said Dewani listed himself as 'gay' in a check box on his profile.

Accused: Shrien Dewani, is accused of arranging to have new wife Anni killed in a staged carjacking as they travelled through a notorious South African township

The court heard that the bullet that killed his new bride did not indicate it was an 'execution'

Dewani held a £60 a year account with Gaydar for six years before his marriage after joining in August 2004.

Dewani used the name Asiansubguy when logging into the site. Sub refers to submissive.  

He also listed himself as 'passive, sub guy' on Gaydar and said he was looking for 'single gay man, gay couple, bi-couple, group'.

The account was deactivated a week after Mrs Dewani's murder. 

Mr Johnson described Gaydar as a homosexual dating site which could also have a 'sexually charged environment.' 

There are fetish and specific sexual activity chat rooms for some members, he told the court.

Prosecutor Adrian Mopp said there were 59 saved private messages on the profile in total, of which 16 were sent or received between May 2009 and October 2010.

He also went through a table of log-ins and log-offs for the profile in question, confirming Dewani had visited the site on November 12, November 15 and November 16 in 2010.

In his formal admissions, Dewani admitted his computer was logged onto Gaydar in the early hours of the morning on November 15 2010.

His wife's body was found in their hijacked shuttle taxi early on November 14 2010.

He also conceded his computer was logged onto the site on November 15 and November 16, and while waiting with Anni for their flight from Johannesburg to Cape Town on November 12 2010.

Mr Johnson explained that the site allowed people to add users as friends or favourites to share messages and photos with.

Mr Mopp said there were a number of photos uploaded onto Dewani's profile.

Mr Johnson said that there were also a variety of chat rooms that 'were particularly sexually charged' but that these visits were not recorded by the website.

Mr Johnson was first approached by United Kingdom detectives in January 2011 to assist them with Dewani's profile and he intermittently provided them with information. 

Tragic: Mrs Dewani, 28, died from single shot that went through her neck and severed her spine. She also had bruises on her leg suggesting a struggle

Dewani joined the Gaydar website in August 2004 and the last activity on his profile was on November 21 2010.

'On that day, the profile was removed by the customer,' Mr Johnson said.

He said although the profile was removed from the site, it was still accessible to staff using a special application. 

Earlier, the court was told that Mrs Dewani was accidentally shot by a robber as he tried to drag her from a taxi to rape her, a court heard today.

The court heard that the bullet that killed his new bride did not indicate it was an 'execution'.  

Mrs Dewani, 28, died from single shot that went through her neck and severed her spine. She also had bruises on her leg suggesting a struggle.

Self-confessed hitman Mziwamadoda Qwabe, who is giving evidence for the prosecution, has told the court that his accomplice had fired the shot as had previously been arranged by Dewani.

But defence barrister Francois Van Zyl accused him of misleading the court.

The lawyer said: 'The gunshot is not what one would normally see in an execution-type killing. 

'It's not what pathologists normally see when a person has been executed. It has all the hallmarks of a shot that went off when it wasn't supposed to go off.'

The taxi where her body was found was dumped beside scrubland. 

Mr Van Zyl suggested he was trying pull her out of the car there to rape her rather than drive further into the Cape Town township.

He said: 'If a person wanted to sexually molest a person by threatening her with a firearm, that is not something you would do in a residential area.

'You were trying to pull the deceased's lower legs.

'You threatened her, pulling her leg and shot her'.

Care home tycoon Dewani had been thrown out of the cab minutes earlier after the gunmen flagged them down as they drove through the township.

The 34-year-old from Bristol claims he was forced out at gunpoint and pleaded with the killers not to harm his wife.

He has admitted being bi-sexual and using male prostitutes during his courtship of Mrs Dewani, but says he loved her.

The Western Cape High Court has heard how a 'middleman' who recruited the hitmen to murder Mrs Dewani played a bigger role in the killing than previously alleged.

Hotel receptionist Monde Mbolombo, who was granted immunity from prosecution for testifying against others in the plot, tried to arrange surgical gloves for the gunmen to conceal their fingerprints, it was alleged.

Qwabe claimed that Mbolombo was merely a 'link man' who had put them in touch with Dewani's taxi driver who was helping him arrange the murder.

But there were repeated phone calls between Mbolombo and the hitman on the evening of the murder, including one in which he told him: 'that thing we were talking about it must happen today', the court heard.

Mr Van Zyl suggested to Qwabe that showed Mbolombo was far more than just a 'link'.

'Monde Mbolombo spoke to you a number of times. Was that just to make idle conversation?

'He takes part in the planning, in arranging the bloodshed.'

Qwabe is serving 25 years in jail for his role in the murder.

Dewani denies murder, kidnapping, conspiracy to kidnap, robbery with aggravating circumstances and obstructing the administration of justice.

The trial continues.
