A girl has died after she fell off a pommel horse in a PE lesson.

Trevyn Joslin, 12, suffered head injuries after landing head first as she tried to leap over the apparatus.

She is thought to have caught her foot and was knocked unconscious when she fell on to a safety mat in front of horrified pupils.

Paramedics managed to resuscitate her after her heart stopped during the incident at Taverham High School, near Norwich, on Tuesday afternoon last week.

Tragic: Trevyn Joslin, pictured with friends in a playground, died a week after receiving head injuries during a school PE lesson in Norfolk

But she died after being in a critical condition in hospital for a week.

She had been taken to the Norfolk and
Norwich University Hospital before being transferred to the specialist 
head injuries unit at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge.

The year eight pupil was described as ‘a sunny girl’ and ‘always smiling’ by headmaster Ron Munson.

He said yesterday: ‘Everybody is deeply saddened and our thoughts are with her family and friends.’

Her parents Hannah, 40, and Derrick, 46, have one other daughter, five-year-old Alesha.

Last night her aunt, Sara Joslin, 40, from Earls Colne, Essex, said Trevyn was ‘an absolute angel’.

She added: ‘What has happened is so tragic for her mum and dad and little sister.’

She posted on Facebook: 'RIP Trevyn, my beautiful neice 
and lovely cousin to Abi and Maggie, 12 years old and taken cruelly 
after a PE lesson.

'We all prayed for you after our visit on Sunday but now your in peace and suffering no more.

'Life is so cruel. Greatly missed by us all. A brighter star in the sky. Love you always.'

Sadness: Pupils at Taverham High School were told of the student's death a week after she suffered head injuries in a PE lesson in an assembly today

Horrified: She is thought to have caught her foot on the pommel horse and was knocked unconscious when she fell on to a safety mat in front of pupils

Pupils
at the school were told of the girl's death in an assembly this morning
and headteacher Ron Munson described her as a 'sunny girl' who was 
'always smiling'.

He
said in a statement: 'It was with great sadness this morning that we 
told students and staff the heartbreaking news of the death of one of 
our Year Eight pupils.

'Everybody is deeply saddened, and our thoughts are with her family and friends at this terribly difficult time.

'Staff and students are being given the support they need to try to help them come to terms with what has happened, both immediately and in the coming weeks and months, and give them every opportunity to share their memories of their friend if they want to do so.

'She was a sunny girl and a bright student who worked hard, played a full part in our school community and could often be seen around the school, getting involved in whatever was going on, and always smiling.

Emergency treatment: The schoolgirl, named locally as Trevyn Joslin, was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridgeshire, but remained in a critical condition and died from her injuries a week later

'She was a big part of our school and we are all deeply affected by her loss.

'The
County Council’s Critical Incident Team is currently at the school to 
support staff and students, and our own pastoral team is also helping us
through this extremely difficult time.'

The school has informed the Health and Safety Executive which has launched an investigation.

Police are also investigating the circumstances surrounding the accident.

A spokesman for Norfolk Constabulary said today: 'Officers are currently conducting enquiries into the circumstances surrounding the death of the girl on behalf of the coroner and in conjunction with the HSE.'
