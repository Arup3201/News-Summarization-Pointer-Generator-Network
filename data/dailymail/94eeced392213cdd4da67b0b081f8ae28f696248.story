A mother who killed her two children while suffering from postnatal depression has been seen at her £1.5million home with the husband who stood by her throughout the tragedy.

Jewellery designer Felicia Boots suffocated the couple's ten-week-old son Mason and 14-month-old daughter Lily days after the family had moved into their new home in south west London, in May 2012.

Boots, 36 was suffering postnatal depression at the time and was under the delusion that her children were about to be taken away from her by social services.

Felicia Boots, 36, who killed her two children while suffering from postnatal depression, has been seen for the first time since the tragedy with her banker husband Jeff, 36

She was spared jail when she was sentenced at the Old Bailey in London, and was instead detained in a psychiatric hospital until doctors deemed her fit for release.

At the time, a judge said a prison sentence would be 'wholly inappropriate'.

Mr Justice Fulford, who described Boots as 'someone who delighted in being a mother' had also told the court: 'This is an almost indescribably sad case.

'Although the results of Mrs Boots's actions were profoundly tragic 
given the loss of two young lives, what occurred was not criminal 
activity in the sense that expression is normally understood.

'I 
unreservedly accept that what she did to the two children, that she and 
her husband loved and nurtured, were the results of physical and 
biological factors beyond her control.'

Now, nearly two years after the tragedy, the 36-year-old has been seen in the neighbourhood where the incident occurred with her banker husband Jeff, 36

Residents in the area, known as ‘Nappy Valley’ because of its popularity with young, rich families, were surprised to see the couple return, but pleased that their lives looked to be getting back on track.

One neighbour, who wished to remain anonymous, told The Sun: ‘People thought she'd never return because the memories must be awful, but we're pleased that she appears to be recovering.

‘Those who know them are humbled by the strength of their relationship. It's a tribute to their character that they appear to be picking up the fragments of their lives.

‘Her treatment has clearly worked and you've got to hope they can find peace.’

Mrs Boots was suffering from post natal depression and feared her children would be taken away when she suffocated her ten-week-old son Mason (pictured) and 14-month-old daughter Lily

Mr Boots had returned home to find his wife sitting in darkness, and his children lying side by side on the floor of a walk-in wardrobe

Boots was supported by her husband after she admitted two charges of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility in October 2012.

At the time, she told the Old Bailey: ‘I will be eternally sorry ... but I am a good mum and I never meant this to happen.’

Her not guilty plea to two murder charges was accepted by prosecutor Ed Brown QC.

Her husband, who was in court, has stood by his wife.

On the night of the tragedy, he returned home from work to find the house in darkness and his wife sitting on the stairs, hugging herself.

He ran upstairs and found their children lying side by side on the floor of a walk-in wardrobe in the master bedroom of the semi-detached house. They had apparently been strangled, the Old Bailey heard.

Mr Boots was heard wailing: ‘My lovely son, my beautiful daughter. They have gone. Help me, help me, help me.’

Police at the family home. Mr Boots told officers at the scene that his wife was a good mother and he 'could not believe that she would do such a thing' 

His wife had been diagnosed with postnatal depression after the birth of both children. She had been prescribed antidepressant medication and her condition outwardly appeared to be improving.

Hours before she killed her children she sent a photograph taken on her mobile phone of Lily to her husband, who took this as a sign that she was feeling better.

He was unaware that she had stopped taking the medication because she was worried about its side effects while breast feeding despite reassurances from her doctor.

Computer records show she made a series of Google searches about her concerns in the preceding weeks.

In a note found next to the bodies she ‘questioned how she could have done such a thing’.

She wrote how ‘she was scared and sorry’ and that her ‘life started to fall apart a few weeks before’.

Her husband called the emergency services but paramedics were unable to save the children.

His wife, who was ‘unsteady and weak on her feet’, was arrested.

Mr Boots told officers at the scene that his wife was a good mother and he ‘could not believe that she would do such a thing’.

The couple live in a £1.4million home in an area of south-west London known as Nappy Valley because it is popular with young, rich families

Many new mothers will experience a brief period of feeling emotional, irritable and tearful after giving birth, which is commonly known as the 'baby blues'.

The latest figures show 85 percent of mothers can feel this way and it usually starts around three to ten days after giving birth and only lasts for a day or a few days.

However, for a smaller percentage of mothers these feelings can develop into a deeper and longer-term depression, known as postnatal, or postpartum depression.

Around 10 to 15 percent of new mothers are affected, with symptoms usually developing within six weeks of giving birth, although it can be several months later.

Common symptoms of the depression include low mood, believing you are unable to cope, difficulty sleeping and feeling like you’re not emotionally connected to your partner or baby.

Charity the Association for Post Natal Illness says it is contacted by 9,000 women every year who are suffering from depression.

Research has also shown that around one to four percent of men experience depression while their child is under one.

As long as postnatal depression is recognised and treated, it is a temporary condition you can recover from, according to the NHS.

Experts advise mothers to ask for help, however many people don’t seek treatment because they might not recognise what’s happening or may feel afraid to ask. 

Treatment for postnatal depression can include self-help techniques, cognitive behavioural therapy and antidepressant medicine.

PND is thought to be the result of several factors including the physical and emotional stress of looking after a newborn baby, hormonal changes and social problems including anxiety over money, and women who have a previous history of depression are deemed to be more at risk.

Some mothers experiencing depression can have some obsessive thoughts, become very frightened about doing something wrong, being in some way inadequate and having their baby taken away, or fear they may harm their baby in some way. 

Most women who experience it won’t act on these thoughts, but it can still be frightening. If a mother is afraid that she may cause harm to the baby or herself then she should talk to her doctor as soon as possible.

Infanticide cases in the UK are very rare.

Figures compiled by the Office For National Statistics from between 2010/11 and 2012/13 show that in 6.4 per cent of the 1,1715 recorded homicide cases from that period the victim was aged under two (around 110 children).

Between 1995 and 1999 in England and Wales, 80 per cent of homicide victims under one year old were killed by a parent, according to research by the Home Office.

However, there are currently no statistics available for how many infant deaths were attributed to postnatal depression.
