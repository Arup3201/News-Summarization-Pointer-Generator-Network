Sentenced: Graham Leith, 27, has been jailed for three-and-a-half years for stealing 170 metal drain covers worth £42,250

A former fireman who stole 170 metal drain covers worth more than £42,000 has been jailed for three-and-a-half years.

Graham Leith, 27, admitted taking 113 covers belonging to Worcestershire County Council and 57 covers belonging to Solihull Council between November 2011 and January 2012.

Despite being worth a staggering £42,250, Worcester Crown Court heard Leith, from Studley, Warwickshire, sold them to scrap dealers for just £10 each.

Leith took the covers leaving gaping holes in roads in North Worcestershire, Warwickshire and the West Midlands.

Jailing Leith, Judge John Steel QC said: 'You were wholly reckless in your disregard to the public and it was simple good luck that no one was injured.'

The court heard Leith stole the drain covers to sell as scrap after he lost his job as a fireman and became addicted to cannabis.

But despite their enormous worth, Leith made just £428 selling the covers to a scrapyard in Kingswinford, West Midlands.

He was arrested in January last year when a member of the public saw his rental van acting suspiciously and called West Mercia Police.

When officers pulled Leith over, they found almost 20 drain covers in the back.

Leith's home was searched but none of the other drain covers were recovered.

The court heard the theft of drain covers had been common in Worcestershire, with more than 1,000 stolen in the county between mid 2011 and early 2012, costing the local authority more than £250,000.

Worcestershire County Council said it was now replacing broken and stolen drain covers with non-metallic ones.

Speaking after the case, Councillor John Smith said: 'Unfortunately, the theft of drain covers is a real problem and the scale of this one case in particular highlights this.

'Not only does it cost the residents of Worcestershire money but criminal acts like this put lives at risk.

Valuable: Although the drains, like the one pictured, were worth more than £42,250, Leith made just £428 selling them to a scrap dealer

'I'm pleased that justice has been done and hope this is a deterrent to anyone tempted to do anything like this in the future.'

PC Tom Birchley, from West Mercia Police, added: 'Stealing drain covers and leaving gaping holes in the road clearly put members of the public at risk.

'As well as the obvious safety implications, the cost of replacing the drain covers was huge, and needed to be met from public funds.'
