The light-hearted war of words between Joey Barton and Danny Simpson shows no signs of stopping - with the latter now claiming Barton has an inferiority complex after being overtaken as QPR's main man by new signing Rio Ferdinand.

The former Newcastle pair have been ripping into each other online during the London club's pre season tour, and Simpson has broken new ground by claiming Barton has been usurped as the top dog at QPR by the arrival of Premier League veteran Ferdinand.

'The banter has been flying,' Simpson said. 'Joey started it off but he's a little bit upset.'

'He's been the main man from his Newcastle days. Joey's always been the main man: he's got his two and a half million followers but now the big man's come in with his five and a half million followers, big Rio.

'He's a little bit upset, he's taken his mantle, hasn't he? If he's that upset and he wants to come in and get involved he can do, I'll put my arm round him. He's more than welcome to put a spare bed in our room and come and join us for tea and biscuits.

'I'm sure he'll realise that the main man's come in and he's just going to have to accept it and join in.'
