A distraught father has demanded ministers take action after his teenage daughter was raped by a boy obsessed with hardcore online porn.

The schoolgirl, who was 14 at the time, was bound, gagged, beaten up and raped by the 15-year-old as he tried to re-enact sadistic scenes he had viewed on the internet.

Yesterday, her father renewed calls for restrictions on internet porn after it emerged the boy spent hours every day looking at disturbing sex videos in the months leading up to the attack.

Sentencing: The older of the teenage attackers has been sentenced to three years in juvenile detention at Teesside Crown Court for the horrific rape of a 14-year-old girl

Earlier this week, he was jailed for 
three years, after a court heard his interest in sex was left 
‘heightened’ and ‘unfulfilled’ by watching the material, and he had 
wanted to ‘experiment’.

Following the case, the girl’s father 
said: ‘Any porn is inappropriate at that young age. But it’s the extreme
 violent nature that is worrying.

‘Kids can get it on their mobile phones really easily. They can get it anywhere.

‘There must be some sort of 
restrictions they can bring in. Surely the safety of girls like my 
daughter is more important than people’s liberty.’

Following the case, pressure groups have renewed their support for the Daily Mail’s campaign to block online porn.

Teesside Crown Court heard how the boy carried out the attack in April last year with a friend who was 14.

'Your interest in sexual matters was heightened and heightened, unfulfilled, and you wanted to experiment'

Judge Simon Bourne-Arton

The older boy was said to have come 
from a stable and respectable background, living with a supportive 
mother in a semi-detached house.

But psychiatric reports revealed he 
became obsessed with watching sadistic pornography on his computer 
without his family’s knowledge, and wanted to re-enact the scenes he had
 seen.

The three teenagers were at a house in
 Hartlepool, County Durham, when the two boys locked her in and turned 
off her mobile phone.

They then gagged her and shoved her in to a cupboard before tying her to a chair and threatening her with knives.

She had plastic bags put over her head and a scarf tightened around her neck.

The court heard the boys laughed as she was pulled down the stairs and banged her head against a wall.

Judge Simon Bourne-Arton jailed the 
older boy for three years, after hearing he was led by the more forceful
 younger boy, who was sentenced to four years. Both had admitted rape 
and false imprisonment.

At an earlier hearing, Judge Bourne-Arton described the attack as 'heinous'.

Judge Bourne-Arton told the older boy: ‘You had for many months, spent many days trawling through internet pornography.

‘Your interest in sexual matters was heightened and heightened, unfulfilled, and you wanted to experiment.

‘Weak-willed you may be and 
weak-minded you may be, but you knew everything that you did to her. You
 may have been led, but you were led willingly.’ The girl’s father, who 
runs a small business, added: ‘This will affect her for the rest of her 
life. She’s very quiet now, she’s a different person.’

Lisa Harker, of the NSPCC, said: 
‘Sadly we are hearing about more and more cases like this. ChildLine has
 seen a surge in calls from young people exposed to hard core 
pornography on the internet and from young girls saying they are being 
pestered, coerced and even forced into mimicking these videos.

‘The industry must help parents block these videos.’

Vivienne Pattison, director of 
campaign group Mediawatch-UK, added: ‘This case is a potent example of 
the potential damage that can be done by porn.

‘It’s definitely the way forward to block porn for everyone unless they opt in to it.’
