Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned that heavily indebted households will be ‘particularly sensitive’ to higher interest rates

Mortgage lenders ‘filled their boots’ by approving scores of applications without making thorough checks just before tougher rules came in, the financial watchdog said.

One in five loans was passed without verifying borrowers’ salaries prior to the introduction of the Mortgage Market Review, which banned the practice.

The figures came out as Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned that heavily indebted households will be ‘particularly sensitive’ to higher interest rates.

In a speech at a conference in Wales yesterday he said record low interest rates posed threats to the economy and ‘the biggest risks are associated with the housing market’.

According to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) between April and June this year, there were 50,000 mortgage sales when banks and building societies did not check buyers earned what they said they did.

This was despite the practice being outlawed on April 26, suggesting many applications were rushed through in the weeks beforehand.

These mortgages accounted for 20 per cent of all sales, a 4 per cent increase on the previous quarter.

Lynda Blackwell, mortgage policy manager at the FCA, said that ‘just ahead of the MMR coming into force we saw an increase in the number of mortgages where income wasn’t verified’.

‘It looks as if there was a bit of filling of the boots going on before everything was switched off’, she added during a speech at the Financial Services Expo, in London, yesterday.

Fast-track mortgages – when loans are granted without requiring proof of income – have since been banned under the MMR. Lenders must now verify all borrowers’ income – which is normally done by checking several pay slips or, for the self-employed, looking at their company accounts.

Andrew Montlake, a director at mortgage broker Coreco Group, said: ‘It is inevitable lenders would try to push things through before the regulation came into force.’

Interest rates have been frozen at 0.5 per cent since March 2009 – slashing the cost of mortgages for millions and making it easier to get on the housing ladder.

But Mr Carney said the first rate rise since 2007 ‘is getting closer’. ‘The economic outlook is much improved,’ he said. ‘While there is always uncertainty about the future, you can expect interest rates to begin to increase.’

The Canadian stressed that any increases ‘are likely to be gradual and limited’ and to a level ‘materially lower than in the past’ when they averaged around 5 per cent. He said such a cautious approach was required in part because of high levels of household debt – much of it tied up in property.

Household debt soared from 100 per cent of household income in 1998 to 163 per cent in 2008 before the housing market crashed. It has since fallen below 140 per cent.

Two members of the nine-strong committee that sets interest rates at the Bank have urged an immediate rise to 0.75 per cent. Analysts expect rates to rise late this year or in the first half of next year – although it is feared rapid rises could derail the recovery if households cut back on spending to meet mortgage repayments.
