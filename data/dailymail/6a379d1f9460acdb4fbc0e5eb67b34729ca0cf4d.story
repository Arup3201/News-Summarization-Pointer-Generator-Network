A grieving husband wanted to give the ultimate tribute to his motorbike enthusiastic wife - leading the procession to her funeral in a 18-ft long trike hearse.

Mother-of-four Dorothy Clark, 47, died from heart and renal failure on September 7 after a six year battle with ill health.

Her family chose a five-wheeled hearse as a final mark of their love and respect to lead more than 50 trikes, motorbikes and cars through Leeds, in West Yorkshire, to Rawdon Crematorium.

Bikers from as far as Scotland travelled to the city the funeral of Mrs Clark - who has always had a passion for trikes and bikes.

Her husband Gary Clark, 54, who rode a Triumph Bonneville motorcycle in the funeral procession, said: 'People always say, "We will always remember Dorothy for her massive smile", she always tried to put her own problems behind her so nobody knew.

'She always made friends wherever she would go - they all loved her.'

The couple, who considered themselves 
motorbike 'rallyists', owned a Reliant Rialto trike as well as the 
Triumph Bonneville, and used to tour the country every weekend.

Final tribute: Mrs Clark's husband Gary and her four sons wanted to make sure her funeral was special

Making a mark: The trike hearse has been specially designed for the funerals of motorbike enthusiasts

Mrs
Clark, who used to work in retail, first fell ill six years ago when 
she had a heart attack and her health gradually declined over the last 
two years.

She suffered
five heart attacks in the final six weeks of her life before passing 
away earlier this month at the Leeds General Infirmary.

More than 200 mourners attended the funeral.

Mrs
Clark, known to many as Doz, requested that any collections at the 
funeral be donated to the Yorkshire Air Ambulance Appeal, which saves 
the lives of countless motorists every year.

Her husband added: 'She said she couldn’t look after me or my sons or the motorbike family.

'So she said, "The only way I can look after you is by having a collection".'

Loved: More than 200 mourners attended the funeral of Dorothy Clark - many on motorbikes or trikes

She leaves behind her husband of 32 years, and four sons, aged 27 to 32.

The family hired the unique Hearse from a company called Your Trike which specialises in the vehicles.

Owner Samuel Mortimer, 19, said: 'We had the trike made about a year and a half ago. We contacted a company called Boom Trikes and asked them to incorporate a hearse and a trike into one unit.

'They weren't too surprised by the request to be honest, but they custom-make lots of trikes.

'We officially launched the company about a year ago but in the last few months business has definitely picked up as people hear more about us.

'We've been all over the country to funerals - we were in Cambridge one week and Lancaster the next, so it seems to be a popular choice.'
