A globe-trotting benefits cheat has admitted taking a four-month trip to Argentina at the taxpayers' expense.

Tracy Johnson, 52, told a jury her flights to Buenos Aires and living costs came out of the benefits she was receiving for being housebound.

She Johnson is accused of claiming almost £50,000 in benefits while running a tour company in South America.

novels during the period she was making claims, some of which are linked
 to the destinations she visited

Johnson, also a published writer, allegedly told the 
authorities that she was agoraphobic, suffered from post-traumatic 
stress disorder and could hardly walk - while actually indulging in 
trips to South America, New York and Madrid.

Prosecutor Joanna James asked her: 'Did you benefits pay for a four month trip to Argentina?'

Mother-of-one Johnson replied: 'I suppose so.'

Johnson claimed she was 'a prisoner of her own home' in Brighton while suffering from agoraphobia brought on by post traumatic stress disorder after witnessing the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the Twin Towers in 2001.

But a jury heard she was living in Argentina setting up a travel company called Northwest Nomads taking people on trekking expeditions.

Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard Johnson also claims to be an actress, dancer, model, DJ, interior designer and a wedding photographer.

She has also written three books including a novel called The Last Tango in Buenos Aires.

Jurors 
have been shown images of Johnson on the open salt plains of Argentina, 
and were told how she had described relaxing palm tree views from a 
hotel in Goa and boasted about expensive spa lunches.

However, she later claimed photographs produced as evidence of her travels were 'misleading'.

Johnson said: 'We know that blogging and Facebooking is a way you get yourself known in business.

'The photograph from the internet, which the DWP said was from 2012, is actually a photograph taken in 1996.'

The court heard Johnson blamed her teenage son Jackson for making bank withdrawals overseas while she was stuck at home in Britain.

The court was shown a transaction made in New York the day before a payment was made to a healthfood shop in Wales.

Johnson said: 'That would be quite a feat for me to be in New York and then shopping in Builth Wells the next day. It is obvious that my son would go to the States and use my charge card.'

She also claims the card was stolen and copied to be used at ATM machines in Argentina.

Johnson showed the court a bank statement detailing withdrawals made from an ATM in Argentina on the same day as a cash withdrawal in Llandrindod Wells, Powys, where she was living at the time.

Johnson told the court: 'That would need me to be in two places at the same time.

'Someone took my card and was using it at ATM machines in Argentina.'

She earlier denied that she had lived a lavish existence, telling jurors: 'If anyone thinks I was living a dream lifestyle for the past few years I want to say that I was not,' she said. It was pretty horrific for the most part.'

Johnson is accused of living a 'champagne lifestyle' and allegedly spent four months travelling through India, shopping in New York and on a sunshine break in Spain.

Prosecutor Joanna James said: 'Tracy Johnson was living the life that honest, decent, hard-working tax payers could only dream of.

'While workers were going out to do their daily grind she was shopping in New York or having a few days in Madrid. It was absolute, blatant dishonesty.'

But Johnson claims she was at home suffering from agoraphobia, depression, hallucinations, anxiety, blackouts and post traumatic stress disorder.

Johnson, of Frome, Somerset, was arrested after an anonymous tip-off about her alleged worldwide travels.

She denies 13 charges of fraud, dishonestly making a false representation and dishonestly failing to notify a change in circumstances between January, 2008 and July, 2012.

The trial continues.
