Jim Murphy (with new deputy leader Kezia Dugdale, above) has vowed to defeat 'arrogant' SNP leaders

Former Cabinet Minister Jim Murphy became Scottish Labour leader yesterday – vowing to defeat ‘arrogant’ Scottish Nationalist leaders Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon.

Talking to The Mail on Sunday, Murphy:

Murphy, 47, who achieved a decisive victory over union-backed rival Neil Findlay, succeeds Johann Lamont who was forced to quit after failing to stop the party’s plummeting ratings in Scotland.

The former Secretary of State for Scotland is giving up his Westminster seat to lead a Labour fightback. If he succeeds, it could help Mr Miliband win next year’s General Election.

But the men are not Labour allies. Blairite Murphy led the unsuccessful Labour leadership campaign of David Miliband in 2010 and was bitter at being sidelined by Ed Miliband.

Murphy sidestepped questions about his relations with Ed Miliband. Instead he poured scorn on Salmond’s decision to try to win a Commons seat after resigning following his defeat in the referendum.

Pointing out it will be Salmond’s third return to Westminster, Murphy said: ‘For someone who, allegedly, wants Scotland to free itself from the Commons, Alex going back there for a third time suggests he doesn’t dislike it as much as he pretends.’

And he took another swipe at Salmond for standing in the Westminster constituency of Gordon, Aberdeenshire, where he is already a member of the Scottish Assembly, instead of Glasgow.

‘Alex hasn’t had the courage to stand in Scotland’s biggest city. Instead he decided to stand in Aberdeenshire. He has a right to do that, but it would have been more confident if he’d stood in Glasgow.

‘For Alex, all the problems of the world are solved by the simple slogan of independence. Most Scots know the world is more complicated than that. A lot of good people who voted Yes in Glasgow are scunnered.’

It means ‘fed up or p****d off,’ he explains. ‘They are scunnered they’ve got David Cameron as PM.’

Murphy feels his own sense of frustration that, despite the result of the referendum – and his brave personal campaign, during which he was pelted with eggs and even branded a paedophile by demonstrators – Salmond and Sturgeon have stepped up demands for more power from Westminster, and possibly another referendum.

Mr Murphy criticised Alex Salmond and his decision to stand as an MP again, adding that he does not have 'the courage' to stand in Scotland's biggest city. The new Labour leader in Scotland said many who voted Yes in the September referendum were left 'fed up' with David Cameron as their Prime Minister

Mr Murphy blamed Labour for the rise of the SNP who, they said, were able to 'capture the symbols and emotions of patriotism like the St Andrew's flag'

‘Labour has been magnanimous in victory in the referendum, the SNP has been victorious in defeat. There’s a sense of arrogance about the SNP. 

The public like confident politicians, but they don’t like arrogant ones.’

Labour has itself to blame for the rise of the SNP, argues Murphy. ‘Just as Scotland was becoming more confident and outgoing, the Scottish Labour Party allowed the SNP to capture all the symbols and emotions of patriotism like the St Andrew’s flag.

‘I want to turn it into a contest between patriotism and nationalism – they are different. Patriotism is pride in your country, people and history. Nationalism is harder edged.’

How did he respond to McCluskey’s claim that victory for Murphy would be a ‘political death sentence for Labour’ in Scotland?

‘Len doesn’t have a vote in Scotland, he doesn’t live in Scotland so I shrug my shoulders. I’m not a fan of that kind of politics.’
