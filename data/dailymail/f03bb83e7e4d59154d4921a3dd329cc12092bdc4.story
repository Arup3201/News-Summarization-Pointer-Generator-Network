Pay-out: Sharon Shoesmith, the social services chief who failed to save the life of Baby P, is to receive £600,000 as part of an unfair dismissal claim

The social services chief who failed to save the life of Baby P is to receive a payout of more than £600,000, it was reported last night.

Sharon Shoesmith, the former head of children’s services at Haringey Council, was sacked from her £130,000-a year job in 2008 in the wake of a public outcry over the death of 17-month-old Peter Connelly.

She launched an appeal claiming unfair dismissal and eventually won and last night BBC’s Newsnight reported Haringey has agreed a compensation deal with her.

Sources say she will be paid more than £600,000, significantly short of the £1million figure it had been reported she was seeking.

Ed Balls, who was Labour's Children's Secretary when Shoesmith was fired, said the payout left a 'bad taste in the mouth'.

Now shadow chancellor, he told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'An independent report said there were disastrous failings in Haringey children's services.

'They said the management was at fault. Sharon Shoesmith was the director of children's services and so of course it leaves a bad taste in the mouth that the person who was leading that department and responsible ends up walking away with, it seems, a large amount of money.'

The package is much greater than the minimum suggested by senior judge Lord Neuberger in a 2011 ruling in the Court of Appeal.

He suggested she was entitled to a minimum of three months’ salary plus pensions contributions. Three months’ salary would have been £33,000.

Newsnight also reported that the  council and Shoesmith had signed a confidentiality clause preventing disclosure of the total. One source told Newsnight that Education Secretary Michael Gove was ‘furious’ about the clause, believing it to be ‘indefensible’.

Baby Peter died in August 2007 after months of horrific abuse at the hands of his mother Tracey Connelly, 31, her sadistic paedophile boyfriend Steve Barker, 36, and his brother Jason Owen, 40.

The family had been visited by professionals including Haringey social workers and doctors 60 times.

However, a hearing at The Court of Appeal
concluded Shoesmith had been ‘unfairly scapegoated’ and that her 
dismissal in December 2008 by Ed Balls, the then Children’s Secretary 
had been ‘intrinsically unfair and unlawful’.

Furious: Michael Gove was angry at an 'indefensible' clause that meant the final payoff will not be disclosed

Lord Neuberger had suggested the Department for Education should contribute to any payout for Shoesmith by her employer Haringey Council.

His judgement said: ‘It would be entirely appropriate for Haringey to seek a voluntary contribution from the Secretary of State whose unlawful directions gave rise to the problems.’

It is understood that the department will meet a proportion of the payout, the details of which were agreed by Haringey Council in the past few days.

Lawyers representing Haringey Council and Shoesmith had been in lengthy discussions regarding a payout since the May 2011 ruling.

Shoesmith had been due to return to court later this week, seeking a declaration that she remained employed by Haringey Council.

That action has now been dropped and the settlement reached between the two parties is understood to be a final one.

Tracey Connelly, Barker and Owen, were jailed in May 2009 for causing or allowing the child’s death.

Earlier this month it was reported that Connelly was due to be released from prison on parole. Charlotte Leslie MP, a member of education select committee that grilled Shoesmith in 2010 said: ‘It’s very simple, you’ve got to ask what responsibility actually means when she was in her position Sharon Shoesmith got a very large salary because she was the head of an organisation which means you take responsibility.

‘Showing leadership means when something goes wrong underneath you take responsibility and make yourself accountable. ‘I think the thing that people are most angry about is that whistleblowers like Kim Holt who raised all this, also lose their jobs but a lady like Sharon Shoesmith walks away with a very big payoff.’

Dr Holt, 54, was forced from her job as the designated doctor for children in care at St Ann’s Hospital in Haringey, North London, in 2007, after she and three other doctors wrote to management warning that staff shortages and poor record-keeping would lead to a tragedy.

Six months later, her worst fears became reality when an inexperienced doctor who had replaced her at the clinic failed to spot that Baby Peter was the victim of serious physical abuse.
