How to solve a problem like Lionel Messi?

That is the question which will test the tactical acumen of Louis van Gaal to the limit.

And even if Van Gaal gets all his tactics spot on, Messi has the ability to wriggle out of any shackle in a split second and change the game.

Warming up for Lionel? Nigel de Jong on the ball ahead of Holland's World Cup semi-final against Argentina

Brutal: De Jong's infamous kung-fu kick on Xabi Alonso during the 2010 World Cup final

Perceived wisdom is that it is waste of time to man mark Messi, because the Argentine can lose that player in an instant then pull the rest of the team out of shape… or exploit his shadow by taking him out of the way to offer team-mates room.

Howard Webb, who hopes take charge of the World Cup final on Sunday, admits he was wrong not show Nigel de Jong a red card for his horror tackle on Xabi Alonso in the final four years ago.

‘With hindsight I would change the call but I didn’t have a perfect viewing angle and with 25 minutes gone in the biggest game of our lives I wasn’t willing to take the risk,’ says Webb

If Webb does get the game on Sunday he would become the first ref to take charge of two finals.

But the word is that if Argentina make it he definitely won’t be chosen given political sensitivities surround the Falklands.

But given that Van Gaal is considering a recall for Nigel de Jong, he could well ask his acerbic midfielder to marshal Messi’s movement.

Then again, the Dutch system of three central defender with two wing backs - 3-4-3 -would seem ideally suited to confront Messi.

The semi ‘sweeper’ system - Ron Vlaar is more central centre back than libero - means that he, Stefan de Vrij or Bruno Martins Indi can all step out into the midfield pocket where Messi, stalks, often, walks around waiting for the ball, comfortable there is cover behind to cope with the forwards.

If Holland’s three Lions keep their concentration and compress the space in front of them when Messi has the ball then he can be stopped.

Given the resilient nature of the Argentina defence, it could unfold as an absorbing, chess-like tactical battle.

Diego Maradona has acknowledged Lionel Messi as his heir.

Former Argentina Ossie Ardiles argues Messi is better and he is certainly taller than Maradona, although not by much.

Maradona stood 5ft 5in. Messi is 5ft 7in. Both are classic No 10s with a magic left foot.

Messi has the name of his son Thiago tattooed to the calf of that wonderful left peg he uses like a conductor’s baton.

And just to remind you, he has scored 42 goals in 91 games for Argentina and 243 goals in 277 La Liga game for Barcelona.

Maradona, who won the World Cup in 1986, scored 34 goals in 91 internationals and in a short period at Barcelona scored 22 goals in 36 games.

This World Cup has been on a different planet to 2010 and the stats back that up.

With three games to go there have been 166 goals scored compared to 138 four years ago.

It’s not just been more attacking, there has been better finishing (excluding England, of course) which has been helped by a ball that they should stick with for next time.

It’s been cleaner with better refereeing, just 169 yellow cards compared with 229 and 10 red cards compared with 16. 

Leading clubs are poised to agree PL proposal to introduce free-kick foam next season.

An executive at a top club told Sportsmail: ‘I’m sure most clubs will vote for it. It has worked so well at the World Cup. It cuts out a lot of nonsense and gets the game going quicker.’

Holland are heading for their fourth World Cup final - amazing for a relatively small country with a population of 17million

But behind England, Holland has the oldest league in the world.

The Argentinian league has the third oldest league in the world.

Argentina, population 42 million, have reached four finals and won two World Cups. Holland are aiming for their first trophy.

Argentina played their first international game in 1901 when they beat Uruguay 3-2 fielding a team made up mainly of British émigrés.

But they lost to Uruguay 4-2 in the first World Cup in 1930.

Holland played at their first World Cup in 1934. 

One to watch: 

All eyes will be on Lionel Messi and Arjen Robben.

But the slightly less fashionable and not-quite-so easy-on-the-eye Dirk Kuyt could be key if Holland are to stop Messi and wear down the Argentina defence.

I-Say :

Uber Fussball: Wunderbar.

They expected fireworks in the favelas but in the end it became a funeral pyre for Brazil.

In so many ways the hosts got what they deserved.

Having abandoned their romantic roots of stylish Samba football in favour of a mean, rough, win-at-all-costs approach insisted upon by Big Phil Scolari, they were simply outplayed by a group of superior players who were never going to be out muscled.

Yes the absence Neymar and Thiago Silva made a difference.

But in that respect it a case of bonfire of vanities.

The Neymar fixation, right down to Scolari wearing a cap bearing his name when they arrived at the stadium, undermined them.

Even when Pele was in his pomp the team did not rely so heavily on him… there were so many others who could play Jogo Bonito, such as Rivelino, Tostao, Gerson, Jairzinho etc.

But having shelved the Samba approach Brazil didn’t have a clue what to do without Neymar and without Silva had no on field leadership.

So what was left was the ashes of a Brazilian football team like we have never seen before as Germany won their semi final 7-1 in such a uber cool manner. Uber Fussball indeed.

World Cup moment: 

The images remain strong for those who recall the 1978 World Cup Final.

The pitch was strewn with white ticker tape, and then there was Mario Kempes, long dark curly hair lie a rock star of the day, with socks around his ankles wearing Puma King.

Kempes had given hosts Argentina the lead but with eight minutes left Holland equalised through Dick Nanninga. But Kempes restored Argentina’s lead and Daniel Bertoni made sure with a third.

World Cup Bet: 

Some bookmakers are offering 1,000 for either team to win 7-1.

But clearly Coral’s think lightening can striker twice and offer 300/1 on a repeat of Tuesday night’s semi-final.

A 1-1 draw is 5/1, 0-0 is 7/1
