Niall Quinn says Sunderland did not spend 14 years developing Jack Colback into an England hopeful just to allow him to join rivals Newcastle on a free transfer.

The former Black Cats chairman believes something went badly wrong when their academy product quit the Stadium of Light for St James’ Park in the summer.

On Sunday Colback comes up against his old club for the first time in the Tyne-Wear derby.

And Quinn regrets both the loss of Colback and the fact they missed out on a fee, unlike the £20million they received from Liverpool for Jordan Henderson in 2011.

‘Jack had been a really strong player for Sunderland for three years (in the first-team) and we didn’t bring him through and work on him to make Newcastle stronger,’ said the ex-Sunderland striker and manager, who retains close links with the club.

‘He and Jordan Henderson have been the pick of our academy players in recent years and we got good money from Liverpool for Jordan, but to lose Jack for nothing certainly hurt.

‘Something went wayward there.’

Colback has since won a call-up to the England squad and is being tipped for a return to the international set-up in light of his recent good form at Newcastle.

Quinn believes Three Lions recognition would be deserved, although he is dismayed that such honours will not be achieved as a Sunderland player.

‘I’ve got no problem with him going to Newcastle and I said at the time he would make an England squad because he’s getting to that stage where he can take a game by the scruff of the neck,’ he said.

‘But from a Sunderland point of view we’re very proud of our academy products and to see Newcastle benefiting from that and us getting nothing in return, it’ s difficult.

‘It’s a shame for us because he was just becoming the player we knew he could be.

‘And I feel a bit for Gus Poyet. Losing Jack was undoubtedly a blow.’

Colback made 135 appearances for Sunderland and one of his five goals came in last season’s 3-0 win at St James’. 

But with the 25-year-old’s contract having expired in the summer, he decided to join hometown club Newcastle in what has proved a controversial move.

Colback, though, has impressed in black and white. He is one of the first names on Alan Pardew’s team-sheet and his new manager has also touted him for England.

Quinn understands why the midfielder is so highly-rated within the game and hopes Sunderland supporters do not turn on him this weekend.

‘Jack’s not the type of player who always catches the eye but he’s such a good, hard-working player, vigilant and disciplined,’ he added.

‘He was Mr Dependable at Sunderland and I certainly wouldn’t encourage Sunderland fans to boo him - although diehard fans might think differently!’
