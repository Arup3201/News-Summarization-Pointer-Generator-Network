Manchester City will allow Frank Lampard to miss the final game of his six-month contract to avoid a potentially awkward return to Stamford Bridge.

City confirmed on Wednesday the expected news that they had signed 36-year-old Lampard until the new year when he will move on to New York City FC for the MLS season.

The length of his stay at City is officially meant to be six months but City are known to be flexible with the fixture list throwing up a game at Chelsea on January 31, just a few days before it is due to end.

VIDEO City confirm Lampard deal 

Lampard is known to harbour serious doubts about whether he wants to play against Chelsea at a stadium where he is revered.

He
 became a free agent in the summer after 13 years at Chelsea during 
which he became the club’s record goal scorer. And to avoid any 
embarrassment, City are happy to let him go to America before the end of
 January in order to begin pre-season work for the MLS which starts in 
early March. They face Chelsea at home on September 21.

Lampard
 trained for the first time with his new City team-mates in traditional 
soggy Manchester  conditions on Wednesday and after a brief team meeting
 outside, moved inside to the club’s Carrington training centre to do 
gym work.

He hasn’t yet 
stated if he is to continue playing international  football but will 
wear Gareth Barry’s old No 18 shirt at City.  Lampard said: ‘Joining up 
with Manchester City is a fantastic opportunity for me to continue to 
train and play at the top level and make sure I am in top condition for 
New York City.

‘It has been 
an amazing few days for me since the unveiling in  Brooklyn and everyone
 connected with both clubs has been fantastic to me. This is a new 
chapter of my career and I’m really excited about the experience.’

City
 boss Manuel Pellegrini added: ‘Frank is a world-class midfielder and 
this is an opportunity which works perfectly for everyone, the player, 
Manchester City, and New York City.

‘New
 York have made a fantastic signing by recruiting Frank, and I’m really 
pleased that we’ll be able to have him with us and help prepare him for 
his new challenge.’

Premier
 League champions City hope to add to the feelgood factor by announcing a
 new deal for  28-year-old Bosnia World Cup striker Edin Dzeko.

Dzeko
 scored 28 goals last season after coming close to leaving under 
Pellegrini’s predecessor Roberto Mancini and has agreed a new three-year
 extension that will keep him at the Etihad until 2017.

City
 have dismissed reports linking them with a loan move for Monaco’s 
Colombian striker  Radamel Falcao. Pellegrini’s side face Arsenal at 
Wembley in the Community Shield on Sunday.
