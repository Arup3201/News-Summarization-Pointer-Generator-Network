Jose Mourinho has lashed out again at the Football Association and Sky Sports, accusing them of operating with double standards in pursuit of violent conduct charges against players.

Mourinho demanded to know why the rules which applied to Diego Costa did not apply to other players in the Barclays Premier League.

He did not mention Robin van Persie but he was talking about the Manchester United striker, who escaped a violent conduct charge after he appeared to throw an elbow into James Tomkins' face during a 1-1 draw at West Ham on Sunday.

The Chelsea boss mimed an elbow and said: 'A player did this in the face of somebody else and nothing happened. The same thing happened last season when Ramires was suspended and one week later a Man City player kicked a player at Norwich, who was on the floor and nothing happened. I'm used to it.'

Ramires was banned for four games last April when cameras caught an off-the-ball elbow on Seb Larsson. It was missed at the time but treated as his second red card of the season.

Michael Oliver was the referee in charge of Chelsea's Capital One Cup semi-final against Liverpool, after which Costa was banned for three games for stamping on Emre Can.

Oliver told the FA that he had not seen the Costa stamp, opening the door to a disciplinary charge. 

At West Ham, referee Mark Clattenburg awarded a free-kick, indicating he had seen the clash, but did not show Van Persie any card. 

Mourinho explained that he 'needed time to understand' why Diego Costa was given a three-match ban

As they were in different competitions, there is a slightly different disciplinary process. The Football League operate by the 'old' system which allows referees to look at a situation again, while the Premier League is led by a three-man panel of ex-referees who step in if they believe the officials have missed something, after reading the referee's report of the game.

'The same people who suspended my player didn't want to suspend a player this weekend,' said Mourinho. 

'A player could have been suspended this weekend and he wasn't. I am still processing that information.'

Speaking of the incident, Hammers boss Sam Allardyce said this morning: 'From a challenge point of view I thought it was pretty naughty. He (Van Persie) had a look to see where the defender was and then took him out basically.

'The assistant referee gave a foul but he didn't think it was more serious. Tomkins should be fit to play tomorrow night which is the most important thing for us.'

Mourinho also shed more light on why he had decided to shun the media following Costa's three-match ban.

He said: 'I'm fine. I was in a good mood. I needed more time to forget why my player was suspended.

'I needed more time to understand why some are punished and others aren't.'

The Everton contest on Wednesday night sees the return of Romelu Lukaku to Stamford Bridge after the Belgium forward struggled to break through into Mourinho's plans and was allowed to leave the club.

The Portuguese manager said: 'He proves every weekend that he's a good player. Nobody has doubts at Chelsea that he's a good player. 

Lukaku has scored 10 goals so far this season for Roberto Martinez's side

'We know Romelu is a good player. (Andre) Schurrle is a good player, (Kevin) de Bruyne is a good player, (Juan) Mata is a good player.

'They are good. We don't sell garbage. We sell top players.

'We sell top players, we get top fees. (Without) top fees we don't sell them, we keep them.

'That's football, that's life, that's market. The player wishes sometimes to be in clubs where they become clearly the first option. That's football, that's life.

'If he's happy, that's good. He wanted to play all the time.'
