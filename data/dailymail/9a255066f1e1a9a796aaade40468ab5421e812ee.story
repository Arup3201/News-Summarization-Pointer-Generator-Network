CLICK HERE to read the full story of Lewis Hamilton's clash with Nico Rosberg as Daniel Ricciardo wins in Belgium 

Nico Rosberg has admitted for the first time to 'regret' over his Spa shame with Lewis Hamilton, but is still refusing to apologise.

It is now all-out war at Mercedes between Hamilton and Rosberg in the wake of Sunday's highly-controversial Belgian Grand Prix.

Hamilton's race was wrecked by a lap-two puncture sustained after the front right-wing endplate of Rosberg's car hit his left-rear tyre, resulting in a puncture.

Hamilton, visibly upset after the incident with Rosberg claimed the German admitted he did it 'to prove a point'.

‘I was gobsmacked. He (Rosberg) basically said he did it on purpose. He said he could have avoided it. He said he did it to prove a point. He said it was all my fault.

 'And you don't have to just rely on me. Go and ask Toto, Paddy and all those guys who are not happy with him as well.' 

The Briton was eventually forced to retire late on in the race due to the damage sustained to his car from a long return to the pits, whilst Rosberg went on to claim second place behind Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo.

Hamilton later claimed the German said his actions were intentional in a heated post-race meeting between himself, Rosberg, motorsport boss Toto Wolff, executive technical director Paddy Lowe and non-executive chairman Niki Lauda.

Rosberg has not said as such publicly, and via his Facebook page continued to suggest what unfolded was 'a racing incident'.

'That was a tough race,' said Rosberg. 'We had the pace to win, but the incident cost us a top result, so I'm really disappointed because for the team it was a bad day.

'As drivers we are here to entertain and show the fans a good time, so our duels are always on the limit.

'I regret that Lewis and myself touched, but I see it as a racing incident - just as the stewards did.

'I was quicker down the straight and went to the outside as the inside line was blocked.

'I gave it a go, and after we touched I realised my front wing was damaged and thought that was it.

'In the next second I saw Lewis also had a problem, which was very unfortunate for him and for the team.

'We sat down quickly after the race, but there will be some more meetings to be held in order to avoid races like this.'

The reaction at the circuit resulted in Rosberg being booed on the podium on four separate occasions, whilst the reaction on Facebook to his own comments were mixed.

Whilst many fans naturally expressed support, there was an equal number - many simply F1 followers and not those who support Hamilton - who called him 'a cheat'.

Change: Rosberg didn't escape damage and had to have his right front-wing endplate replaced in the pits

Rosberg's lack of an apology comes after Hamilton, visibly emotional after speaking to his German counterpart about the incident, claimed: ‘I was gobsmacked. He (Nico) basically said he did it on purpose. He said he could have avoided it. He said he did it to prove a point. He said it was all my fault. 

'And you don't have to just rely on me. Go and ask Toto, Paddy and all those guys who are not happy with him as well.'

Hamilton earlier admitted the incident would seriously damage his title chances.

'I don't know why he hit me but I'm sure he'll leave here happy,' Hamilton added.

'It's really gutting. I was trying so hard in the car to do what I could with it but it was so damaged, I must have lost 50-60 points of downforce. I'm gutted for the team, we've had such a difficult time this year. We had a good start, it was looking positive.

'I took the corner as I usually do, it was my line and... I don't know why he hit me but I'm sure he'll leave here happy.'

Upset: Hamilton was visibly shaken after a meeting with Rosberg, who is claimed to have admitted guilt

April 6: During the third race of the season in Bahrain, Hamilton cuts across Rosberg, almost causing a crash. Rosberg appeals to the team over radio, saying 'Tell him that was not on!'. The British driver holds on to win the race, with Rosberg second.

May 11: In Spain Hamilton switches engine modes without the team's permission to hold off Rosberg and win the race. 

May 24: Qualifying for the Monaco Grand Prix sees the two drivers have their most public flashpoint. Rosberg crashes while on course for pole, denying Hamilton the chance to set a quicker time. Hamilton alleges the crash was deliberate but the German is cleared of any intent. Rosberg wins the race from pole. 

August 24: The two drivers collide on lap two in Belgium, with Rosberg later admitting he did not try to prevent the crash.
