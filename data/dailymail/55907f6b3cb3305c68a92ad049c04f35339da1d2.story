In tatters: David Cameron’s long-standing promise to get tough by reducing net migration to ‘tens of thousands’ a year has suffered a humiliating blow

The number of foreigners moving to Britain has soared dramatically, it was revealed yesterday, leaving the Government’s flagship pledge to slash immigration in tatters.

David Cameron’s long-standing promise to get tough by reducing net migration to ‘tens of thousands’ a year suffered a humiliating blow with news that it rose by 40 per cent.

The Office for National Statistics said 243,000 more people moved to the UK last year than departed – an increase of 68,000 newcomers on the previous year.

European Union citizens accounted for 44,000 – or two-thirds – of the increase, including a rise in arrivals from Romania and Bulgaria.

For the first time since the annual population survey began in 2004, there were more EU citizens living in the UK – 2.5million – than held non-EU nationality (2.3million).

The statistics were published as No10 was rocked by Tory MP Douglas Carswell defecting to Ukip, which has demanded tougher controls on Britain’s borders.

The figures offer clear evidence of how a new wave of EU immigration has taken advantage of Britain’s fast-recovering economy – which has produced an extra two million private sector jobs since 2010 – while the Eurozone remains mired in chaos.

Experts told Mr Cameron that imposing limits was, in a reference to folklore, akin to ‘King Canute trying to hold back the waves’.

According to the quarterly statistics, a total of 560,000 immigrants arrived in the UK in the 12 months to March, while an estimated 317,000 people left.

The overall number of arrivals from the EU was 214,000 and, for the first time in three years, the number of people migrating to the UK from outside the EU increased by 19,000 to 265,000. More than 80,000 Britons returned to the UK.

There was an increase in people arriving for work to 228,000 – up from 190,000 – while 177,000 people came here as students. Ministers have no powers to stop the free movement of European workers.

Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, said the Tories had ‘gone quiet’ on the target and regarded it as a ‘mistake’, while Labour said the Government’s migration target was in ‘tatters’.

‘This massive gap between rhetoric and the reality, as well as no serious action to tackle the root causes of anxiety about immigration, is destroying public trust and confidence,’ said shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper. Ukip MEP Steven Woolfe said ministers were not ‘listening to the people’ and that the levels of immigration were ‘driving down wages and causing overcrowding in schools’.

Sir Andrew Green, chairman of the MigrationWatch think-tank, said: ‘Either we get immigration under control or we accept that in the next 20 years we will have to build 12 cities the size of Birmingham. Where can they possibly be put?’

John Hawksworth, chief economist for accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers, said the figures suggested that ‘relatively strong growth’ in the UK was drawing in workers from elsewhere in the EU.

The number of people leaving the UK has consistently been lower than the number of immigrants arriving each year since the 1990s

‘In the face of these economic forces, attempts to limit net migration to the “tens of thousands” appear like King Canute trying to hold back the waves,’ he said.

He said hard-working immigrants benefited the economy, but added: ‘They also put additional pressure on public services such as health and education, whose budgets have been constrained by austerity programmes in recent years.’

Stephen Booth, research director of the Open Europe think-tank, said the latest figures would be a headache for Mr Cameron.

‘These figures will provide more ammunition for those who want the Prime Minister to go further in limiting the rights of EU migrants not only to claim welfare benefits but settle in the UK,’ he said.

Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said reforms had cut net migration by a quarter since Labour were in power and the Government remained focused on controlling migration at ‘sustainable’ levels.

He said reforms to rules on benefits, health care and housing made them among the tightest in Europe.
