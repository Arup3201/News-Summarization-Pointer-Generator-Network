The number of thefts carried out by criminals on bicycles has tripled in the past two years, figures show.

Statistics from Scotland Yard show there were 3,754 reported snatchings in the capital last year, up from 1,214 thefts in 2010.

All these crimes specifically relate to snatches by thieves riding bicycles.

Recent victims include the wife of Nick Mason, the Pink Floyd drummer, who was walking her two Labradors, Linka and Layla, on Hampstead Heath when a man prised her iPhone from her hand as he rode past on a bicycle.

Annette Mason, 52, said that she is afraid to use her mobile phone in public after being mugged last December.

Although the figures are for London, the head of the National Mobile Phone Crime Unit said an increased use of smart phones by pedestrians across the country has made them targets.

He said: ‘If somebody’s on a pushbike riding down the pavement or the road and they see someone with a mobile phone or a handbag, they can quickly catch it and then get away very, very quickly.

‘They can go down alleyways, they can go in between tower blocks, it’s a very quick way of getting away from the scene of the crime.’

The figures also revealed the number of thefts carried out on mopeds rose by more than 80per cent in the second half of 2012, compared to the year before.

There were 394 reported crimes from July to the end of December, up from 213 thefts over the same period in 2011.

Primary school teacher Emily Mottram, 28, had just stepped off a bus in Islington, north London, when her phone was snatched out of her hands by a cyclist riding on the pavement.

She said: ‘It was dark, there was no-one around that I knew. I just thought what would have happened if it had been even later and I wasn’t stepping off a bus?’ She said the incident had made her more aware of the threat.

‘If someone’s coming close to me I’m instantly quite nervous and I never used to really have that awareness,’ she added.

‘Maybe it’s a good thing. I’m a lot more aware of what’s going on around me but it’s also made me feel concerned about having any possessions.’

Rachel Griffin, director of personal safety charity the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, said the increased number of bike lanes alongside pavements had made people vulnerable to the threat of such attacks.

She said: ‘Increasingly footpaths are being shared with bike lanes, so it’s important to be aware that when you’re walking along, you might be on the pavement, but there could be a bicycle either coming up towards you or behind you.

‘We advise people in a shared space with a bike lane to hold their valuables, or their bag in particular, on the opposite side to that which the bicycles are on.’

ROBBERIES BY CYCLISTS

Cycling is riding a wave of new found popularity. Latest figures show more than three million people cycle “most days” and four out of 10 Brits now take to the saddle regularly, with the figure as high as 53 per cent in London.

Research by consumer analysts Mintel reveals that in the last year alone the number of British cyclists has soared from one in three people (34 per cent) in January 2012 to 41 per cent by November.

Today, half of British men (50 per cent) are taking to their bikes, while London (53 per cent) is the cycling capital of the nation.

As the number of cyclists continues to rise, the research shows six per cent - 3.1 million people - are taking to two wheels “most days”, and one in 12 (eight per cent) cycle two or three days a week, while the same number cycle on a weekly basis.
