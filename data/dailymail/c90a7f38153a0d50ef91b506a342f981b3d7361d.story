Two hunters from an ancient tribe show no fear as they use a bow and arrow to catch their dinner - just yards from a fully grown cheetah.

Photographer Jack Somerville, 26, captured the spectacular images in the Naankuse Wildlife Reserve in central Namibia, Africa.

The tribesmen appear to be entirely comfortable standing next to the potentially dangerous animal as they go about their work.

Fearless: Two hunters from an ancient tribe look unconcerned as they use a bow and arrow to catch their dinner - just yards from a fully grown cheetah

One of the hunters sits down and looks relaxed as the fully grown cheetah strolls around behind him in the Naankuse Wildlife Reserve in central Namibia, Africa

Relaxed: Both man and beast appear at one with each other as one of the hunters takes aim with a bow and arrow

No sudden moves: The two men monitor the movements of the fully grown wild cheetah. The animal, called Aiko, was brought to the reserve after being rescued

Mr Somerville, from north London, took the pictures after spending time with the San people, who are members of indigenous hunter-gatherer people in southern Africa.

They can also be called 'bushmen' or 'basarwa' and their territories span Botswana, Namibia, Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe and South Africa.

Mr Somerville travelled to Namibia to capture their way of life and their attitude around wild animals on camera.

He said: 'These two hunters are completely relaxed with the cheetah, a large male called Aiko.

'As with any big cat which is not born in captivity, Aiko is not tame. However, once you know the correct way to behave around him and respect his space it is possible to get up close to him.

'The two hunters know Aiko and were therefore comfortable with him. The cheetah is a rescued cheetah and resident on the reserve.

At one with nature: Photographer Jack Somerville, 26, captured the spectacular images while spending time with the San people in the Naankuse Wildlife Reserve in central Namibia, Africa

Even though the cheetah was born in the wild and is not tame, these two huntsmen seem so in tune with nature that they are comfortable with being around potentially dangerous animals

'The San have a deep respect for wildlife, due to co-existing alongside them for centuries. The San are thought to be the oldest living culture on earth.

'This respect for nature and the environment is something that has been lost by many other cultures the world over.'

Mr Somerville photographed the two men as they were hunting for warthog.

He said: 'The San hunt on foot, often tracking animals for days. They use small bows and arrows, as well as snares for smaller animals.

'The arrows are tipped with poison made from larvae found in Marula fruit. Normally they will hunt anything from guinea fowl to the larger antelopes. 

Aiko was taken to the reserve when he was captured in a trap set by a farmer when he was a cub, along with three of his siblings

The San people can also be called 'bushmen' or 'basarwa' and their territories span Botswana, Namibia, Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe and South Africa

'However the San do not hunt more food than they need to feed their village.

'They also gather food from bush vegetation, making sure to replant anything they dig up to ensure nothing is taken away from the land.'

Aiko was taken to the reserve when he was captured in a trap set by a farmer when he was a cub, along with three of his siblings.

Farmers will often set traps for big cats to stop them preying on their livestock.

The two San huntsman were at the reserve to teach their ancient skills to the younger, more modernised San people who live in central Namibia.
