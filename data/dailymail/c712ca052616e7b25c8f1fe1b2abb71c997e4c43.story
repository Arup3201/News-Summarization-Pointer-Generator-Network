Backlash: Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls is said to have boasted that he played a key role in a doomed takeover deal that drove the Co-op Bank to the brink

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls faces a backlash from thousands of savers after it emerged he boasted of playing a key role in a doomed takeover deal that drove the Co-op Bank to the brink.

Last night he was also facing questions over donations made to Labour by the Co-op in the year the fateful merger with Britannia Building Society was sealed.  

During a speech in 2010, Mr Balls told how he helped grease the wheels of the 2009 deal. He claimed it would create the ‘first ever super-mutual’ providing a better deal for customers ‘rather than the banking elite’.

In reality, the merger was sowing the seeds of disaster for the Co-op Bank, which is now launching a raid on its own investors to plug a £1.5billion black hole in its finances.

Mr Balls claimed that as Economic Secretary under Gordon Brown he secured the Treasury’s backing for a new Private Member’s Bill that allowed the takeover to be pushed through.

The Butterfill Bill was passed in 2007 and lifted a ban on mutuals and co-operatives from merging.

At that time regulators were concerned about the quality of the loans on Britannia’s books.

Last night Mr Balls also faced accusations of ‘conflict’ of interest as it emerged that Labour received £750,000 in donations from the  Co-op Group in 2009 – the same year the merger was sealed.

Most of this was channelled to Labour’s sister party, the Co-op Party, which supports 32 MPs.

Mr Balls is a Co-operative and Labour MP and his office received £50,000 from the group last year.

The usually outspoken Shadow Chancellor has refused to criticise the Co-operative Group over its rescue plans, which involve slashing the incomes of at least 7,000 investors –  many of them pensioners.

In the 2010 speech, entitled ‘A Co-operative mini manifesto’, Mr Balls described his ‘co-op vision of people working together for the benefit of the whole community’.

He also said he was ‘proud’ to be the first Co-op MP to stand to be a Labour leader.

Mark Taber, a private investor who is leading a campaign on behalf of thousands of investors to block the plans, said: ‘Balls has been strangely quiet but has some serious questions to answer.

‘He has been left with egg on his face and must now break his silence.’

Last year the Co-op Group donated £800,000 to fund Labour and Co-operative Party candidates.

Labour has also received £34million in cheap loans from the Co-op over the past twenty years.

The Co-op’s rescue plan involves freezing the income of thousands of investors in generous bonds.

Some were being paid as much as 13 per cent in annual interest – or £1,300 for a £10,000 investment.

In exchange for their bonds, investors will be offered either a cash pay off, shares in the new bank, or new bonds. But they face losing 35p for each £1 of Co-op bonds they hold.

A spokesman for Mr Balls said: ‘Ed has long been a champion of the important role that not-for-profit mutuals can play in providing financial services.

‘When he was a minister he supported this Private Member’s Bill, which enabled co-operatives and building societies to merge for the first time without demutualising.’

The spokesman added the merger decision was ‘a commercial decision for the Co-op Bank’.
