Manchester United are expected to make a formal offer for Feyenoord centre-back Stefan de Vrij.

The 22-year-old was poised to join Lazio but the Italians believe the player is now destined for Old Trafford after being informed of United's interest.

United boss Louis van Gaal also has a strong interest in Feyenoord right back Daryl Janmaat, although the third Feyenoord member of Holland's defensive line Bruno Martins Indi has an offer from Porto.

De Vrij had a tour of Lazio's training ground in May but they believe their chances of signing the defender have now gone and believe he will join United for around £8m.

Meanwhile, Juventus have shown fresh interest in Patrice Evra but the Frenchman is still wanted by van Gaal despite the signing of Luke Shaw.

Evra is key to united's dressing room and they yesterday confirmed the sale of Alex Buttner to Dinamo Moscow for £4.5million.
