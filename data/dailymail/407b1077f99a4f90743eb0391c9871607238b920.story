Jerome Ellis was sentenced to six years detention for killing his stepfather in a savage knife attack with his big brother

A 14-year-old boy was sentenced to six years detention for killing his stepfather in a savage knife attack with his big brother.

Jerome Ellis, 14, and Joshua Ellis, 23, stabbed Neil Tulley, 54, to death as he lay on the sofa at the family home in Cedar Way in Guildford, Surrey, last August.

A jury at Guildford Crown Court, found Jerome not guilty of murder but guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter on the basis of loss of control.

Joshua was found guilty of murder.

Mr Tulley, who was in a relationship with their mother Marie, was caught by surprise as he lay 'asleep or nearly asleep' at the time of the attack, which was so severe he was nearly beheaded. 

He suffered more than 60 blows to his body.

Judge Christopher Critchlow told Jerome: 'The evidence is not clear as to who did what in that savage attack - it maybe that Joshua did more than you.

'You accept that you used the knife and you knew what you were doing.'

A year earlier Mr Tulley had threatened to kill Joshua and had swung at him with an axe, the court heard.

He was arrested and charged with making threats to kill but was acquitted by a jury - although he had admitted some of the behaviour.

He later returned to the crowded family home but by August last year the relationship between Mr Tulley and Ms Ellis had deteriorated and he was living on the sofa.

A post-mortem examination confirmed that Mr Tulley had died from multiple stab wounds and found he had '65 separate sites of injury' across the whole of his body. 

The most severe wounds were at the neck, with one 8cm (3 inches) deep.
