Former head of the UK Border Force Brodie Clark gives evidence to MPs investigating the row over UK border checks

A bombshell inquiry has found the head of the UK Border Force relaxed vital immigration checks in clear defiance of ministers because he wanted ‘quick wins’ to reduce queues at airports. 

A leaked draft copy of a disciplinary investigation into the conduct of Brodie Clark – who yesterday denied being a ‘rogue’ civil servant – reveals fingerprint checks on foreign nationals who need a visa to enter the UK were relaxed on 164 occasions.

This was despite the Home Secretary explicitly saying that, even in ‘extremis’, this must not happen in case it allowed those from terrorist hotspots such as the Yemen to enter unchecked.

Staff also casually referred to a 
pilot authorised by Theresa May – which did controversially relax checks
on EU biometric passports and children travelling with their parents or
on school trips – as ‘children and chips’.

But
the investigation, by former police officer David Wood, concludes Mr 
Clark – who yesterday denied any wrongdoing in a dramatic appearance 
before MPs – had a ‘case to answer’ that he had broken the Civil Service
Code.

Had
he not resigned, this could have led to his dismissal. The report by Mr
Wood, the UK Border Agency’s head of enforcement and crime, which is 
likely to be published next week, supports Mrs May’s claim that Mr Clark
had relaxed border checks without her approval.

Mr Clark has said this claim was ‘wrong’ – putting Mrs May’s career on the line by implying she had misled Parliament.

The internal inquiry, one of three into the scandal, paints a picture of how the civil service threw open the UK’s borders.

But it is the confirmation that Mr Clark did not have approval to go further, by relaxing visa checks on non-EU nationals, that will be most significant at Westminster and be seen as vindication of David Cameron’s decision to back Mrs May.

The report – titled ‘formal misconduct procedures’ – makes clear that Mr Clark had been agitating since January this year for the Government to relax border controls and was looking for ‘quick wins’ to prevent chaos at airports.

He initially suggested three measures: not routinely opening the  biometric chips on passports belonging to EU nationals; not routinely checking the fingerprints of foreign nationals requiring a visa and not routinely checking the documents of EU children travelling with their parents or on a school trip.

Immigration Minister Damian Green’s office initially said he may be content to support the proposals but wanted more details of their impact.

In April, Mr Clark was sent a response from Mrs May’s office saying neither she nor Mr Green was ‘content to agree’ to the changes.

The report then highlights an e-mail from Mr Clark to a senior official in the Border Agency which lays bare his concerns that Mrs May will not do what he wants.

It says: ‘I am now very concerned about the impact of the summer pressures at the border. I am of the view that procedural changes will not be in place in time for the main pressure period.

‘I have little confidence that the Home Secretary will sign-off  the changes (in time/at all) and  we seem to have lost some of  the urgency around getting this dealt with.’

A string of further emails are exchanged between Mr Clark’s office and Mrs May’s. One, dated July 19, tells Mr Clark: ‘I can confirm you do not have authorisation to go to scenario 3 (suspending fingerprint checks) in any circumstances.’

Mr Clark later asks again if he could move to ‘Level 3’ in ‘absolute extremis’. He was informed on July 26 the answer was that he could not – ‘in any circumstances’.

The report goes on to detail how senior staff had informed Mr Clark that they had taken ‘additional measures’ which went beyond those authorised by ministers.

On two occasions, details of these ‘additional measures’ were included in weekly reports for ministers – but they ‘remained with Brodie Clark’s Private Office’ and were not sent to Mrs May or Mr Green.

The scandal was finally uncovered after a visit by John Vine, chief inspector of immigration, to Heathrow Airport. He alerted Mr Clark’s superiors, who quizzed him about what had been happening.

At this point, the report says Mr Clark conceded that checks on fingerprints for those needing a visa had been suspended on 164 occasions over the past year – 156 times at Heathrow.

One very senior official said he could not ‘possibly understand’ how Mr Clark believed he had the authority for his actions.

The report, which is likely to be published next week, concludes that: ‘I am clear that the evidence available would have led to a  recommendation, should BC still be a civil servant, that he has a case to answer in that he has not  met the standards articulated in the various parts of the [Civil Service] Code’.

It adds: ‘The Home Secretary  authorised a time limited pilot to enable Border Force to move to Level 2 checks [not checking the chips on EU passports or EU children travelling with their families or on school trips against the Warnings Index] when queues became unmanageable, and then only for the period needed. No other reductions in border controls were authorised, even in “absolute extremis”.’
