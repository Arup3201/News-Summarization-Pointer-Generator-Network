Anthony Joshua is set to return to the O2 Arena on January 31 as he continues his march towards a huge domestic fight with Tyson Fury.

The Olympic champion is due to fight Michael Sprott in Liverpool on November 22 and his promoter, Eddie Hearn, told Sportsmail he is likely to fight American Kevin Johnson in the new year.

Hearn said: ‘I hope to put him on a show at the O2 on January 31. I’d like to see him fight Kevin Johnson of the US, a good fighter who went the distance with Vitali Klitschko.

‘After that, bring on the Brits. In Fury, David Price, Dereck Chisora and David Haye, there is a pathway of excellent fights and I want, as a fan, to see them all.’

Fury called out Joshua on Twitter, though a fight is unlikely until next summer at the earliest.

Joshua extended his professional record to nine knockouts from nine fights against Denis Bakhtov on October 11.
