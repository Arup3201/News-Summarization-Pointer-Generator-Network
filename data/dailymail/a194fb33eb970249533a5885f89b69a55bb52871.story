TV presenters are prepared to handle all kinds of bizarre events when they broadcast live from an outdoor location.

But BBC Breakfast's Carol Kirkwood could have been forgiven for thinking a weather report from a deserted beach in West Sussex would go off without a hitch.

The weather presenter was, however, given a nasty surprise when a cheeky Labrador popped into view and took a pee in the sea behind her.

Hosts Charlie Stayt and Louise Minchin burst into laughter as the pet animal relieved itself in the background

Carol was delivering a live weather report this morning from the beach at West Wittering in Sussex when the black dog appeared.

The animal crouched behind the unwitting presenter and had a pee before calmly trotting off, completely unaware that its antics had been broadcast to the nation.

Staff working back at the BBC burst into laughter and hosts Charlie Stayt and Louise Minchin struggled to compose themselves.

Both presenters warned Kirkwood not to turn around and she joked: 'Upstaged by a dog, it is the story of my life.'

The weather presenter was initially unaware what was happening behind her and carried on with the weather

But she burst into laughter after show producers told her that the cheeky dog had stolen the limelight

Staff in the BBC's studio struggled to contain their laughter after the incident, which happened before 8:30am
