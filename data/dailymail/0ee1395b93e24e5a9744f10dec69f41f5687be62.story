The elated mother of a British student missing in Thailand for more than a month spoke of her immense relief last night after he was found alive.

The promising diver had been due to fly back to Britain on January 8, but never boarded his flight.

After an agonising wait, delighted Helen Armstrong-Bland, 46, said her son, Tom Armstrong had been now found safe and well.

Due home for Christmas: Tom Armstrong sent an e-mail home saying he had 'run into some kind of trouble' and would be returning in January instead - but he never arrived

Mrs Armstrong-Bland said: 'He was due to come home before Christmas but for whatever reason didn't arrive.

'That sent alarm bells ringing, but we received an email from him saying he had run into some kind of trouble in Bangkok.'

Tom, 22, then sent an e-mail saying he would get on a flight on January 8.

His anxious parents waited until the last train from London but Tom never arrived.

Tom, who lived with his mother and two siblings in Kelsale, Suffolk, had not been in touch with his devastated family since.

A Facebook appeal revealed a potential 
sighting in Bangkok almost three weeks after police said cash had been 
withdrawn from his bank account in the city.

After hearing nothing from Tom again,
Mrs Armstrong-Bland met up in the Thai capital Bangkok with Tom's 
father, Kingsley Armstrong, to help Interpol and local authorities 
search for him.

His sudden disappearance in the Far East sparked an international hunt.

Helen, an art and design teacher based in Ipswich, said: We're in the very early stages and don't yet know exactly what went on, but he is safe and that's really good news. It's all that matters.'

The mother-of-four added: 'I'm not sure if he is aware of just how much coverage this has had in the media.'

I just want to thank everyone in the 
Saxmundham community, our close friends and family, and people from all 
over the world - complete strangers.' 

'We wouldn't have found him without them.' 

Mrs Armstrong-Bland said an auction of promises planned for this Friday in aid of Missing Abroad in Saxmundham Town Hall would still be going ahead.

'I always said it would be great if Tom was back home for it', she said.
