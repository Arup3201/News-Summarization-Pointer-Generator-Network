As many as four dozen people were injured when two Chicago Transit Authority trains crashed at a station west of the city.

CTA spokeswoman Lambrini Lukidis says the crash happened Monday morning during rush hour, just before 8 a.m., when an out-of-service eastbound train hit a westbound train that was stopped at the Harlem station in Forest Park, about 10 miles west of downtown Chicago.

She says 33 people suffered non-life threatening injuries. Forest Park Mayor Anthony Calderone says he was told as many as four dozen people were injured, most reporting back and neck pain. He says they were taken to local hospitals.

About four dozen people were injured in the accident. None of the injuries were serious

Lukidis says the eastbound train was empty but traveling on the same track when it hit the westbound train. A section of one train car was crushed. The CTA is investigating.

Robert Kelly of Amalgamated Transit Union 308, said it's still unclear what happened and how the train got out of the station.

'Both the supervisor in the station at Forest Park and the motorman who was sitting in the station said there was nobody on the train as it went through and collided with the other train,' Kelly told NBC Chicago.

'This is baffling everybody,' he said.

Several ambulances were sent to the scene of the crash, where as many as four dozen people were injured

Martinez Butler, a train engineer for another company, said he witnessed the collision.

'There was a train that was stopped at the station. Another train came through and looked like it blew the signal, because I heard beeping,' she told NBC Chicago.

'I'm a locomotive engineer,' she added. 'I know the systems, I know the sounds. When you hear those beepings it's warning you that there is an obstruction in front of you and you need to stop.'
