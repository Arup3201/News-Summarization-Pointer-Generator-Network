His body was returned to his hometown of Midland for burial Monday, where crowds gathered to pay their respects. Some held American flags while fellow Marines saluted as his funereal procession made its way through town.

His hearse was escorted by eight Marines and local police squads blaring and flashing their lights.

'His smile would make you smile,' friend and fellow Marine Tanner Welch told Mlive.com.

Welch described the fallen Marine as a tough-minded and motivated person who liked to exercise and stay in shape.

'He was a Marine through and through,' John Old, who son is also a Marine and friend of Szymanski's, told Mlive.com.

Friends say the family, who was too distraught to speak, was very proud of Szymanski's accomplishments in the military.

His mother Dawn always wore a 'Marine Mom' necklace to work, MLive.com reported. 

Szymanski, a 2008 graduate of Midland High School, loved his doberman, Dag, and enjoyed taking him on long runs. He was also an avid outdoorsman. 

He will be buried at Midland City Cemetery on Tuesday, Oct. 28.
