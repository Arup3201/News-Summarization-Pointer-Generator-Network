When the Duchess of Cambridge stepped out in navy blue  in New York last night, it offered yet more evidence of her growing penchant for the LDD - or Little Dark Dress.

Chic in a flowing Jenny Packham gown worn with show stopping jewels and an elegant up-do, the Duchess looked every inch the princess as she made her way inside on the arm of husband Prince William.

But her embrace of darker hues is a far cry from the early years of her marriage, when the fledgling royal opted for inky colours by day but picked show-stopping gowns in pale shades of cream, lilac and nude by night.

Dark side: The gown was the latest in a series of inky gowns sported by the Duchess since announcing her pregnancy

Now, however, the Duchess is rarely spotted in dresses that don't come in her favourite dark navy and black - both of which she has worn almost without exception for evening appearances since announcing her pregnancy in September.

Last night's floor-length navy gown wasn't even the first time the Duchess turned to the dark side in New York, with Kate making her Big Apple debut in a delicate lace dress by eco-label, Beuhlah London.

The brand, a favourite of the Duchess', is run by her old school friend Lady Natasha Rufus-Isaacs, and is famous for its flowing, body-skimming dresses - all of which comes in handy when there's a bump to conceal.

With the exception of the bright pink Mulberry coat worn to visit the 9/11 memorial, most of her day wear came in dark shades too, most notably the glamorous £680 Goat coat worn for a visit to the Northside Child Development Centre in Harlem. 

But it is her embrace of dark partywear that has garnered the Duchess the highest number of headlines, beginning with the stunning Diane von Furstenburg gown worn to meet stars - among them One Direction's Harry Styles - at the Royal Variety Performance late last month.

With its pretty lace sleeves and sweetheart neckline, the dramatic number added a shot of demure glamour to the night - and eclipsed the more colourfully dressed A-listers who also attended.

A day later and Kate was back in black, this time for a Kensington Palace reception. This time though, the Duchess dispensed with designer in favour of High Street staple Hobbs, teaming a sheer polka dot blouse by the brand with a skirt by Jenny Packham.

And the Duchess certainly isn't alone in her love of an LDD. Both Little Dark Dresses and the classic LBD have long been a party season staple, with sales of the dresses increasing by 29 per cent as December approaches, according to department store Debenhams.

'The garment that the majority of clients have said they want is that elusive little black dress,' commented a spokesperson for the store. 'The perfect one will take you from a cocktail party to an opera, from a Michelin starred restaurant to a night club, without missing a beat. A dress that can do that is certainly worth the effort.'

Like the rest of us, the Duchess' love of the LBD and the LDD has been a lengthy affair. Already a fan of inky day wear, since giving birth to Prince George in July 2013, black and navy have become an increasingly important part of her evening wardrobe.

After wowing the crowds in red and navy during the day, Kate opted for a £2,145 bespoke Jenny Packham dress - complete with a glittering crystal fern - for a reception on her final night in New Zealand.

Then, there was a glamorous knee-length Temperley cocktail dress, once again made from her favourite black lace, which she wore to a SportsAid ball in late 2013.

Although the majority of her pre-pregnancy gowns came in vibrant shades of red or nude, black did manage the odd appearance, most notably at the London premiere of Warhorse in 2012.

It isn't only her clever way with LDDs that has made the Duchess a sartorial sensation during her tour of the Big Apple - her chic maternity style has made headlines as well.

This, says style expert Lisa Haynes, is all down to her embrace of the coat-dress which manages to combine formal glamour with space for the royal bump.

'The Duchess of Cambridge has toured the world's style capital wearing a succession of winter dress coats,' she explains. 'It's clever one-piece dressing that doesn't overtly draw attention to her bump. 

'Note that we've barely caught a glimpse of the outfit underneath - Kate's chic coat choices do all the work. She's even kept accessories to a minimum.'

But it's not only pregnant women who can benefit from a tailored coat. 'As Kate demonstrates, these tailored coats are surprisingly versatile whether you're pregnant or not,' adds Haynes.

'For a formal vibe, she teamed her monochrome Goat crepe coat with black opaques and heels but gave her Tory Burch bouclé coat a more relaxed spin for the basketball layering it over a pair of skinny trousers.

'Her overcoat collection struck the perfect balance for the couple's royal tour duties. Floaty maternitywear and stretch waistbands could have looked too casual, while clingy bodycon would have been inappropriate.'
