Just two local lads on show

The only Staffordshire lad on view Tuesday night was wearing Manchester United rather than Stoke City colours, with United's teenage forward James Wilson born just 10 miles up the road from Stoke-on-Trent in the county market town of Biddulph. To add to the irony, the only Mancunian in either starting line-up was visitors full-back Phil Bardsley.

Louis van Gaal embracing FA Cup 

Louis van Gaal may have expressed reservations about the busy Christmas period but there is one English tradition he is falling over to embrace – the FA Cup. The draw for the third round takes place on Monday and United's manager is getting all giddy about it. 'I know what the FA Cup means to this club, our players and our fans,' he wrote in his programme notes. Not to mention the only realistic chance he has of winning a trophy in his debut season at Old Trafford.

Fellaini's first Old Trafford goal since Everton days

Marouane Fellaini's towering header was his first goal at Old Trafford for two-and-a-half years – when he played for Everton. The Belgian's only previous strike at the Theatre of Dreams came in April 2012 when his volley helped Everton draw 4-4, and cost United the title.

Herrera revels in Rooney absence 

Ander Herrera was a revelation. Signed in the summer as a holding midfielder, he revelled in Wayne Rooney's absence to play at the top of Louis van Gaal's midfield diamond, and when he drifted to the left, his delivery for Fellaini's opening goal was perfect.
