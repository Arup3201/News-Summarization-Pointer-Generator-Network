The rose-colored mansion borrows from 16th-century Italian design and was created by renowned Atlanta architect Philip T. Shutze.

The color theme is continued inside the
grand property set on one and half acres - dusted in pale pink, the 
dining room and ballroom look like a setting from 1939 film Gone With 
The Wind.

The 10,905 square-foot property has seven bedrooms and eight and a half bathrooms, reported Curbed.com.

The identity of the seller is unclear, according to Buckheadheritage.com, the original owner of the mansion was 
Andrew Calhoun.

Mr Calhoun was in real estate and his wife was the founder 
of the first garden club in Atlanta, the 1923 Peachtree Garden Club.

The original estate spanned  one hundred 
acres and included an 
orchard, various gardens, a lake, and tennis courts.

But the land was split up in the 1960s and sold off.

Mr Schutze modeled the house after the Villa Cussano in Verona, Italy, which was designed by Giovanni Battista around 1650, according to This photographer's life.

The home and gardens were constructed on an axis in the same design as the original.

To the highest bidder: The Pink Castle has been listed and relisted at least five times since it first hit the market for $3.5M in May 2011

Scale: Although the sizable house is grand, some of the rooms are not too imposing and instead look intimate

Sympathetic: The kitchen remains archaic and has not been refitted and remodelled in the latest designs
