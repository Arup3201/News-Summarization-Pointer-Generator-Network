Like many social media evangelists, Twitter founder Jack Dorsey uses a variety of digital platforms to document his life but one of his latest posts might get him into trouble.

Last Thursday morning as Dorsey’s commercial flight was taking off from San Francisco he tweeted a link to a short clip of his flight leaving the ground.

To film such a video Dorsey would have had to use his cellphone, thereby disobeying Federal Aviation Administration instructions which prohibit the use of electronic devices during take-off and landings.

Dorsey, now CEO of mobile payments company Square, has not replied to requests for comment about his actions, but according to CNN Money passengers might not need to comply with that particular request for much longer.

The FAA claims that using electrical devices during take-off poses a safety issue and that radio signals emitted from electronic devices can interfere with an aircraft's communications. 

However this doesn’t prevent as many as 69 percent of adult passengers reportedly using their portable devices during flights, according to a recent study by the Airline Passenger Experience Association and the Consumer Electronics Association.

Almost one-third of passengers say they have accidentally left their device on, found the same survey.

As a result of such large numbers of passengers failing to comply with the request to switch electrical devices off, the FAA is currently looking into what kind of devices it might be OK for passengers to use on board in those situations.

A draft of the committee's report recommends the FAA should relax its ban on e-readers and MP3 players, but not cell phones, reports The Wall Street Journal.

'As the consumer electronics industry has exploded,' the report says, the FAA's traditional stance of giving individual airlines leeway to evaluate the safety of specific devices before allowing them to remain on at low altitude 'has become untenable.'

The FAA likely won't make a formal decision on the matter until after it receives the final version of the advisory panel's study, now delayed til end of September.
