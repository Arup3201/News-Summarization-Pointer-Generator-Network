Alistair and Jonny Brownlee demonstrated their amazing powers of recovery on Saturday to lead a dominant England team to glory in the mixed team triathlon relay, just two days after winning gold and silver in the individual event.

Olympic champion Alistair, 26, and London 2012 bronze winner Jonny, 24, along with team-mates Jodie Stimpson, 25, and Vicky  Holland, 28 — also displaying ‘bouncebackability’ after taking gold and bronze in the women’s individual event on Thursday — stamped their authority on the sport at Strathclyde Country Park.

One incident threatened controversy — when Alistair was outside the changeover box as he began the fourth and final leg of England’s race, transitioning from Stimpson.

Slow motion replays confirmed he was 
clearly outside but, with the naked eye, race officials did not  spot 
his error and England went unpunished.

Even
 if a sanction had been applied — and it would have been a 15sec penalty
 during Alistair’s run — the result would not have changed. He was so 
far clear of the field by the time he began his final leg he was able 
to amble to the finish, literally.

He
 even stopped to collect a St George’s Cross flag from a supporter as he
 breezed down the straight 48 seconds ahead of South Africa in second.

England’s
 total time was 1hr 13mins 24sec. South Africa won the silver in 1hr 
14min 13sec and  Australia took the bronze in 1hr 14min 14sec.

As
 if to emphasise what a breeze the race had been, Alistair attended the 
medal ceremony, put on his backpack, hopped back on his  bike, and set 
off on a ride back to his team hotel.

‘It’s
 fantastic,’ he said of England’s win, stressing that he always planned 
to give himself plenty of breathing room on the run  by destroying the 
field during the ride.

‘It’s
 a great way of testing our strengths and weaknesses. I knew I could run
 all right so I was determined to win it on the bike.’

After
 winning the individual gold to complete a career medal set of every 
conceivable honour in his sport, Alistair had joked he may now retire. 
But he clarified yesterday: ‘I’ve got no plans to retire, I have got a 
few years in me left I think.’

With
 the completion of all three Commonwealth Games triathlons — men’s, 
women’s and mixed — England had taken five of a possible seven medals, 
including all three golds.

The
 mixed event, in which each athlete completes a 400m swim, a 6km bike 
and a 1.6km run, was  making its debut here at a major games.

It
 has been denied a spot at the Rio Olympics in 2016 but could feature in
 the Olympic Games of 2020, and Britain would certainly welcome its 
arrival.

Asked if she 
thought the International Olympic Committee (IOC) should consider 
including it on the Olympic programme, Holland said: ‘I really hope so. 
Just look at the atmosphere it generates.

‘The lead changes so often. It’s  a great spectator event. Guys and girls in the same race — it’s unique.’

Alistair’s
 only real competition yesterday was from his brother, with the pair 
admitting before the race they would be comparing split times.

Jonny
 had got the better of Alistair  at the team championships in  Hamburg 
two weeks ago, and his split was quicker than his older brother’s 
yesterday, clocking 17min 29sec for his swim-cycle-run, with Alistair 
clocking 17min 36sec. But if the latter had actually bothered to go full
 pelt on his run, that gap would not have been there, or been reversed.

However, Alistair remarked on how winning a joint medal with his brother was extra special.

‘It’s very different for us doing something as a team, although we race together all the time,’ he said.

‘To
 be able to share an achievement is really good. We’ve raced so many 
relays together over the years and we really enjoy doing it. It’s  
fantastic to be able to do it on a major scale like we did today.’

Jonny,
 meanwhile, admitted it was nice just to get on top of the podium: ‘It 
feels a bit strange to win a gold medal finally but it’s nice. I want to
 win but I normally get beaten by Alistair. To get a gold medal is 
pretty special.’

England 
trailed in fourth place after Holland’s leg, five seconds behind Canada 
and with Northern Ireland and New Zealand ahead.

Jonny restored ‘normality’ during his run, however, putting England ahead.

He
 briefly allowed the lead to  slip when going through a poor  transition
 with his bike, but swiftly sprinted back in front and then kept the 
lead to the end.

Stimpson had a 16-sec lead by the time her swim began, and handed Alistair a nine-sec lead he hugely extended.

Stimpson
 said: ‘It has been an incredible couple of days. However, I’ve been in 
these dream teams before and it’s not worked out, so I wasn’t hanging 
the medal around our necks before the race.

‘The
 Olympic distance hurts like hell but this hurts, too, probably because 
you are racing for a team and putting everything on the line for them.’

Holland added: ‘We always  knew the relay was ours if we did everything we should do normally.

‘A
 lot of the athletes were fresh as they had not raced on Thursday, so it
 was important for for us to do  everything right and just get the job 
done.’
