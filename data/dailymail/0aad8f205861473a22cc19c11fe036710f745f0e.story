A routine three points for Chelsea masked a serious issue for them – another day another diver.

Just before half time Branislav Ivanovic broke into the penalty area and under the attention of Andy Carroll the Serbian threw himself to the ground. 

It was definitely an attempt to win a penalty and get his side two goals ahead in the first half.

Former World Cup and Premier League referee Graham Poll believes the Serbian threw himself to ground

Ivanovic was attempting to win a penalty for Chelsea that could have put his side 2-0 up in the first half

The defender surged into the West Ham penalty area but went to ground too easily

Ivanovic thought that Carroll would grab him but got it wrong and really should have been cautioned for simulation by the otherwise excellent Michael Oliver.

I am surprised that Jose Mourinho has not told his players to stay on their feet after dives from Willian, Gary Cahill, Diego Costa and others – but then unless they are consistently cautioned why should he?
