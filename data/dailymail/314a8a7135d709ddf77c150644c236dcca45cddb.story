Recovery teams searching for bodies at the MH17 crash site have called off the operation because fighting was making it too dangerous, the Dutch Prime Minister said today.

Mark Rutte praised the effort of the recovery mission so far, and promised families the search will resume in the future when the situation is 'more stable' in Ukraine.

He added: 'We're stopping now, but we won't stop.'

The Ukrainian government announced afterwards that it was now suspending the ceasefire with separatist rebels at the site of the Malaysian airliner crash.

Deep in thought: Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte praised the effort of the recovery mission so far and promised families the search will resume in the future when the situation is 'more stable' in Ukraine

Flight MH17 was shot down in eastern Ukraine on July 17, killing all 298 people on board.

In
 all, 228 coffins with remains have been returned to the Netherlands, 
but it is not known how many victims that number represents.

Mr
 Rutte said the international recovery team has learned that the 
recovery effort undertaken by local authorities immediately after the 
crash was more thorough than initially thought.

The
 international team of Dutch, Australian and Malaysian recovery workers 
was unable to reach the site until July 31 because of fighting in the 
area between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russia separatist rebels.

Experts suspended their search for bodies because of security fears, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said

Since then, it has found remains of only a few victims, despite expectations it might find as many as 80.

Mr Rutte said that it now appears 'fortunately that more was done after the disaster than we thought until now.'

Local
 Ukrainian authorities carried out 'an intensive search in the area with
 800 volunteers and there were many bodies recovered in those (first) 
days,' he said.

Those remains are being identified in the Netherlands.

A separate investigation into the cause of the crash is continuing, Rutte said.

A spokesman for the Dutch Safety Board, which is overseeing that investigation, yesterday said preliminary findings due on August 17 won't be ready until several weeks after that date.

Wim van der Weegen said it was in part because of the difficulty investigators have had in reaching the crash site.
