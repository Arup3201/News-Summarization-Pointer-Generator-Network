Souter has been jailed for 22 years after being convicted of sexually abusing seven boys over two decades

A former BBC presenter dubbed a ‘predatory paedophile’ has been jailed for 22 years after being convicted of sexually abusing seven boys over two decades.

Ex-BBC Norfolk and Radio Clyde broadcaster Michael Souter was found guilty of 26 offences including indecent assault, indecency with a child, serious sexual offences and seven counts of possessing indecent images of children at a trial which finished earlier this month.

He was sentenced at Norwich Crown Court today.

Norfolk Police said the 60-year-old, of Low Bungay Road, Loddon, Norfolk, was responsible for ‘one of the worst cases of prolonged child abuse’ officers had dealt with.

Souter’s victims and their families packed the court for today’s hearing.

Judge Mark Lucraft QC said there were others not covered by the counts in this trial who were also abused by Souter, who showed no emotion as sentence was passed.

He described Souter’s attempts to claim that the allegations were fabricated - and that police concocted evidence as part of a conspiracy to smear his name - as ‘pathetic’.

‘The childhood of many of your victims was destroyed and their lives blighted,’ he said.

‘You exploited your position to groom each of them.

‘You took hundreds of photographs of 
boys in shorts and were the only person in this court who could not see 
these pictures for what they were.’

He added that Souter displayed an ‘ongoing sexual obsession with boys’ and posed a risk of further offending on his release from prison. Souter will be banned indefinitely from working with children.

He was also ordered to pay legal costs of £14,694 and may be forced to sell properties in the UK and abroad to pay this, the court heard.

More possible victims have come forward in the two weeks since Souter's conviction, said Detective Inspector Paul Brown, from Norfolk Police.

Referring
to Jimmy Savile, he said revelations following the disgraced DJ’s death
had encouraged victims of child abuse to 
speak out.

He added: 'While I wouldn’t compare Souter and Savile 
directly, both used their celebrity to cultivate a certain respectable 
image and both cases have served to highlight that social attitudes are 
changing and child abuse will be investigated rigorously by police.

'We
have certainly seen an increase in people coming forward and hopefully 
convictions like this can continue to give people the confidence to do 
so.'

Norwich Crown Court heard Souter was a 'sexual deviant' who was obsessed with young boys in shorts and uniform.

The 60-year-old was found guilty of 26 sex offences at Norwich Crown Court and will be banned from working with children indefinitely. The court heard his abuse began in 1979 when he worked at BBC Radio Norfolk

His catalogue of abuse began in 1979 when he worked at BBC Radio Norfolk.

Originally
from Scotland, Souter worked as a producer and presenter in both 
commercial and BBC radio since the mid-1970s. He had previously 
presented for Radio Clyde.

Since 1989 he has worked as a freelance broadcaster and had run a media relations consultancy.

During
the 1980s and 1990s, Souter’s abuse escalated as he took up senior 
positions within the community, including as a Scout leader and social 
services youth mentor.

Two of the boys were 'repeatedly abused' over five years.

The broadcaster was first arrested by
police in 1993 but, because of a lack of evidence against him, he 
continued abusing boys for another six years.

One victim said in a statement read to the court: 'Souter’s insistence that he is innocent and that this is all lies and conspiracy has not allowed full release and closure.'

Andrew Hill, defending Souter, said: 'His position prior to these matters - the charitable works and many other local good works - will all be forgotten when it comes to sentencing. A distinguished career in the Navy and journalistically now comes to nought.'

Souter was ordered to pay legal costs of £14,694 and may be forced to sell properties in the UK and abroad to pay this, the court heard.
