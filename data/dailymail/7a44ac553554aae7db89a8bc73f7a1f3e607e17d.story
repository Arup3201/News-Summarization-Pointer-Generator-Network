A Russian student nurse is facing expulsion after uploading pictures of herself holding human organs during operations and mocking patients on social media.

Gulnaz Yalalova, 20, is seen holding a spleen in one image and also uploaded a snap of a seriously injured hand before making fun of the teenage patient while working at a hospital in Kazan, 500miles east of Moscow.

Yalalova was observing the surgery of a 16-year-old girl who had fallen from an apartment building when she took the pictures, later calling the patient a ‘275lbs schizo’.

Inexcusable: Student nurse Gulnaz Yalalova Instagrammed pictures from a surgery during her work experience and mocked the patient in the comments

The student nurse uploaded the images to her Instagram and engaged in conversation with her friends in the comment section, revealing personal details about the patient.

The surgery at Kazan Regional Clinical Hospital involved a 16-year-old female who fell from an eighth floor window in the Russian city.

As the images of the patient's organs were posted on the web, a friend asked Yalalova: ‘Are you having fun there?’

The third year trainee nurse, who wore full surgical dress for the picture replied: ‘We sure are.

'Look, we do not sleep at night. By the way, the girl is 16. Jumped from the eighth floor.’

Bad doc: The 20-year-old posed holding the spleen of a 16-year-old female and took pictures during the young woman's life-saving surgery at the hospital in Kazan, Tatarstan

Breach of trust: Although the 16-year-old patient may have been injured in an attempted suicide, Ualalova branded her a'275lbs schizo' along with the pictures from the teenager's surgery

The friend said: ‘Nasty. How is she?’

Yalalova, a student of Kazan Medical College, said: ‘In a hard condition - broken ribs, legs, head injuries, spleen is torn, easier to say what is OK.

‘She's a “Schizo”, weighs over 275lbs’

The friend replied: ‘Well now I see why she did it.’

The images has now been brought to light, and Yalalova has been banned from returning to work at the hospital and may be excluded from her degree.

‘I totally disapprove of this. It is a horrible case,’ Regional Clinical Hospital director Rustem Gaifullin said.

‘It was a serious surgery, the young woman fell from the eight floor. The team of doctors saved her life and this girl left the operation scene to take photos.

‘Of course she will never come back here for medical practice.

‘It is a matter of choosing people as medics of the future. The medical college must understand this.’

Rapped: The student, who has since removed her Instagram account, has been banned from returning to do work experience at Kazan Regional Clinical Hospital

The director of prestigious Kazan Medical College,  Zukhra Khisamutdinova, said: Gulnaz entered our college in 2012. Now she is a third year student, studying to be a nurse. ‘

‘We had never problems with her as a student,’ she said.

‘It is the first such case in the 177-year history of our college. Of course, social networks appeared not long ago.

She added: ‘There are internal rules for the students, about behaviour and clothes, but there are no rules about social networks. We could not even imagine such a thing could happen one day.’

The college director said it was now an ‘open question’ whether Yalalova would remain as a trainee nurse.

Sergei Petrushin, a psychology lecturer at Kazan University, said: ‘I think it is a sign of emotional and social immaturity, inanity.

‘It is just like when little children do not quite understand what they are doing.

‘Her age tells us she is an adult, but in terms of psychology, the girl just does not understand that this is not right.’

He claimed: ’It is a general problem of our young people. They are immature, their ethical boundaries are not fixed.

‘They hardly understand what is good and bad. But anyone can make a mistake.

‘If the girl thinks deeply about this mistake and realises what she did, she can still be a nurse in the future.’
