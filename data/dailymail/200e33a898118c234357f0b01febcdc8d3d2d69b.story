Angelina Jolie's stunt double is suing Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation for allegedly hacking into her voicemail and deleting messages, it emerged today.

Eunice Huthart is the first alleged victim of hacking to launch a legal claim against the Murdoch empire in the U.S.

The British 46-year-old, who won the first series of TV game show Gladiators, claims The Sun and the News of the World hacked her phone in an attempt to gather gossip about Ms Jolie.

News International, the British arm of News Corp, has already paid out millions of pounds in compensation to celebrities and other public figures who were hacked by the News of the World.

However, Ms Huthart is the first person to have sought justice through the American courts, which could cause major difficulties for Mr Murdoch ahead of a planned break-up of News Corp into entertainment and publishing divisions.

The stuntwoman claims that News International papers used information found on her voicemail to uncover Ms Jolie's relationship with co-star Brad Pitt during the filming of 2005 hit Mr & Mrs Smith.

Ms Huthart's complaint against News Corp is detailed in court papers filed in Los Angeles on Friday.

The claims dates back to 2004 and 2005, when she was apparently living with Ms Jolie - she says the pair were close friends who 'travelled and socialised together' as well as being colleagues on film sets.

Ms Huthart worked as the actress' stunt double on Tomb Raider 2 and Beyond Borders as well as Mr & Mrs Smith.

Around the time covered by the complaint, the Sun and the News of the World, which closed down in 2011 after revelations of widespread hacking at the title came to light, ran a number of stories on the burgeoning romance between Ms Jolie and Mr Pitt.

The stuntwoman claims that the source of many of the stories was her voicemail, as 'no one except Brad Pitt's bodyguard, Ms Jolie's bodyguard, their respective personal assistants and Plaintiff knew that Brad Pitt and Ms Jolie were now an "item"'.

The court papers also allege that Ms Huthart missed a number of deleted messages from colleagues and family members, leading to inconvenience and emotional distress.

Among the messages from Ms Jolie which Ms Huthart never received were apparently 'hotel arrangements where she was staying, code names for hotels and individuals, dinner reservations, meet-up times and, on occasion, when she sought the help of Plaintiff during times of need'.

Troubles: The claim is the first hacking case Rupert Murdoch's media empire has faced in the U.S.

Ms Huthart, from Liverpool, rose to prominence in the UK when she won the first series of Gladiators. She later joined the cast of the show under the pseudonym 'Blaze'.

As well as doubling for Ms Jolie, she has appeared in blockbusters such as Titanic and GoldenEye.

News Corp has so far refused to comment on the allegations. The company has repeatedly denied that hacking took place at the Sun.

The phone-hacking scandal came to light in 2001, when it was emerged that the News of the World had hacked into the voicemail of murdered schoolgirl Millie Dowler.

The Sunday newspaper was closed down by Mr Murdoch, and the company has since paid out more than Â£200million in compensation and legal expenses related to the victims of hacking.

A number of former News International executives are currently facing trial for hacking-related offences.

News Corp is set to be divided into its profitable film and television division, to be named 20th Century Fox, and the struggling print business, which will keep the News Corporation name.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
