A man who has been unable to smell properly for 20 years sniffed out a major gas leak just days after a kick to the head during a rugby match restored his lost sense.

Edward Baker's ability to smell gradually deteriorated throughout his adult life after he repeatedly broke his nose playing his favourite sport.

He has even undergone surgery to fix the problem, without success. 

During a recent game of rugby, he received a kick to the face which left him with another bruised and bloody nose.

Incredibly, after the swelling went down, he realised he was able to breathe properly and that his sense of smell had been restored.

The 41-year-old marketing director put his newly-restored ability to good use when he smelt a gas leak near a school in Bournemouth, Dorset just days later.

He immediately called the gas board and engineers rushed out to seal off part of the residential road and fix the leak.

Mr Baker said: 'Although I haven't been able to smell gas for years, I still recognised the pungent smell straight away.

'The leak was in a built-up area with a school and nursery just yards away so the guy who kicked me in the face potentially saved a serious situation.'

Mr Baker said he first broke his nose at the age of 14 and then on frequent occasions over the next 25 years.

Eventually he couldn't inhale properly through his nose and his ability to sniff scents and odors completely faded.

He said the player who kicked him to the head did a great service both to himself and those who would have potentially been affected by the gas leak

In a bid to restore his lost sense, Mr Baker underwent an unsuccessful operation last year which involved doctors drilling into his nose to try to improve his breathing.

But, where skilled surgeons failed, a burly rugby player succeeded.

Mr Baker's latest nasal injury happened during a game involving his team, Hampshire-based New Milton III and Poole 1st last month.

He said: 'I've broken my nose a number of times over the years and it gradually got worse and worse until I couldn't breathe through it or smell through it.

'I had an operation last year where they drilled into my nose to make me breathe better through it, but it didn't work.

'So where the surgeons failed this bloke's size 12 boot worked. It was at the end of the game and there was a bit of a melee on the pitch and my nose got kicked.

'As the swelling started to go down about a week later I realised I could breathe and smell again.

'I had sensed it was coming back, and then as I was walked up the road and I could smell gas, something I'd never been able to detect before.

'I called the gas board. What I had smelt wasn't the source but gas was creeping into a chamber nearby. But it highlighted the area and they were able to fix it.'
