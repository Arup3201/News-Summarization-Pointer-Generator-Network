Apparently leaked images show what seems to be the Galaxy S IV smartphone, Samsung's next-generation flagship mobile which is set for launch this week.

The pictures, if legitimate, confirm several of the widespread rumours about the forthcoming phones specifications, particularly the upgrade to a massive 5in screen.

The handset, dubbed 'GT-I9502', is apparently customised for Chinese carrier Unicom. It is said to have a 'Universal5410' 1.8GHz processor, 2GB of RAM and a PowerVR SGX 544MP graphics processor.

Is this the next Samsung Galaxy? These pictures,
which appeared earlier today on Chinese mobile forum 52 Samsung, appear
to show a version of the forthcoming handset 
customised for the Chinese market

You might need bigger pockets: The pictures appear to back up rumours that the S IV will have a 5in screen - with the device dwarfing the hand of the man who has taken the photographs

The images were uploaded to Chinese forum 52 Samsung just hours ago and were quickly picked up and republished by respected tech site The Verge.

A reporter for the site says the Universal5410 is probably a codename for the Exynos Octa 5410, an eight core processor which has been widely speculated to be at the heart of the new Galaxy.

Aside from the screen-size upgrade, the pictures show a mobile that is broadly similar to the last-generation Galaxy, complete with oblong home button.

Another hotly anticipated feature of 
the forthcoming handset is Samsung's patented 'eye tracking' system, 
which will allow users to automatically scroll through webpages by 
simply casting their eyes across the display.

Smartphone arms race: It is believed the new handset could have a 1920x1080 display and boast a 13MP camera as Samsung tries to leap ahead of Apple in the smartphone wars

'The phone will track a user’s eyes to determine where to scroll', a Samsung employee told the New York Times.

In January Samsung filed for a trademark in Europe for the name 'Eye Scroll', which is believed to refer to the new feature.

It also filed for the 'Samsung Eye Scroll' trademark in the United States in February, describing the service as 'Computer application software having a feature of sensing eye movements and scrolling displays of mobile devices, namely, mobile phones, smartphones and tablet computers according to eye movements; digital cameras; mobile telephones; smartphones; tablet computers.'

The Samsung Galaxy S IV is set to be revealed in New York on March 14th: This mock-up graphic based on rumoured specs by mobile retailer Expansys shows how it would compare to previous Galaxies

The S4’s predecessor, the S3, already had a feature called Smart Stay that detected if users were looking at the screen.

The rumours come amid increasing speculation over the handset ahead of its unveiling on Thursday in New York.

It is believed the new handset could 
have a 1920x1080 display and boast a 13MP camera as Samsung tries to 
leap ahead of Apple in the smartphone wars.

Mocked-up
graphics put together by mobile phone retailer Expansys based on the 
widespread rumours have shown how the S IV could match up to previous 
incarnations of the Galaxy device.

A camera on the front of the handset is able to focus on the user's eye.

It can then calculate where on the screen they are looking - and automatically advance pages when they reach the bottom, for instance.

However, The Verge sounded a note of 
caution over the latest set of apparently leaked photographs, reminding 
readers that the S III was leaked several times in dummy casings that 
concealed its actual design.

'While this leak doesn't have a 
visibly-fake outer shell, there's every chance Samsung could've crafted a
false casing for testing purposes — just as there's every chance this 
could be an elaborate hoax,' the site reported.

Samsung Electronics' mobile division chief JK Shin told South Korea's Edaily news website that the decision to launch the new smartphone in the U.S. was spurred by demand from mobile networks.

'We introduced the Galaxy S III in London last year, and this time we changed the venue (to New York)... as we were bombarded with requests from U.S. mobile carriers to unveil the Galaxy S IV in the country,' he said.

Samsung unveiled its first Galaxy S during the CTIA mobile trade show in the U.S. in 2010, followed by the Galaxy SII at the MWC fair in Spain in 2011 and the Galaxy SIII in London last year.
