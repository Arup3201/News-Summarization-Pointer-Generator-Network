A young American woman celebrating her 25th birthday in Cancun was tragically killed in a bizarre accident after a ceiling beam fell on top of her at a five-star resort.

Lauren DuFresne was out on the balcony of La Amada Hotel around 11:30 with her boyfriend when the decorative beam landed on her head and chest.

This is the second daughter the DuFresne family has lost – 14 years ago, their 2 ½-year-old MacKenzie tragically died after she rolled up a car window while her head was still outside of the car.

Tragic: Lauren DuFresne was celebrating her 25th birthday in Cancun with her boyfriend when she was struck and killed by a falling ceiling beam at a five-star resort

Ongoing: Mexican authorities continue their investigation at La Amada (The Beloved) resort in Cancun after the beam fell

Shoddy construction? Local news reports say that the beam was only held up by drywall and wasn't properly mounted

Ms DuFresne was in Cancun with her boyfriend to celebrate her 25th birthday; the two were staying at La Amada, near Isla Mujeres, according to local news reports.

Promising future: Ms DuFresne was working at a prestigious financial firm at the time of her death

The name of the hotel means ‘The Beloved’ in Spanish. 

Around 11:25 on the night of November 28, a decorative cement column fell on her, striking her head and chest and knocking her unconscious. 

Local news reports said that Ms DuFresne was rushed to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead. The beam at the exclusive five-star resort had been suspended only by drywall.

A representative from La Amanda did not immediately return MailOnline’s request for comment.

Her father, Don DuFresne, told News4Jax that many questions remain unanswered, intensified because it is a police investigation in another country.

The family grew up in Jacksonville, Florida. 

Ms DuFresne was a graduate of the University of Florida, and a star volleyball player and a member of the Delta Gamma sorority.

She got a job in the financial sector upon graduation, according to her obituary, and had a promising future in the industry.

‘She was a rising star in the financial industry whose limits were endless,' her obituary read.

‘She will be sadly missed by many. We miss you, love you, and will always keep dear to our hearts the precious moments and times together.'

She is survived by her brother Parker DuFresne, and her sister, Brook Staver, as well as their parents, Mary Kay Staver and Don DuFresne.

Ms DuFresne’s funeral will be held Thursday morning. The family has set up a website asking for donations to 'Angels for Allison,' a non-profit for families who have lost children.
