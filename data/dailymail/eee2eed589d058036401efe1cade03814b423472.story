Mystery: A researcher at an ancient monastic site in Cheshire has found this man, who died 750 years ago, was probably murdered with a single sword blow

Call in the Cold Case team - a 750-year-old murder has been unearthed at an ancient monastic site in Cheshire.

Skeletal remains of a 13th century knight buried at Norton Priory show that he died after being slashed by a sword.

The mystery man, who lies in a grand stone tomb at the site, had been examined before and was believed to have died naturally.

Shirley Curtis-Summers from the University of Liverpool says that several vertebrae were severed, which may have caused damage to connecting muscles and nerves.

By examining the skeleton, PhD researcher Mrs Curtis-Summers discovered the injury, which would have left him alive for several hours, stricken and unable to walk, before a very painful death.

A battlefield injury might be expected for a knight of this period but Medieval weapons expert and TV presenter Mike Loades suggests a more sinister incident.

He said: 'It seems almost inconceivable that a wound of this nature could be caused to anyone wearing armour. The slice would have had to cut through the armour for the entire length of the wound.

'This is not possible which suggests this wound was not received in battle. The possible scenarios that first occur to me are: assault by robbers or caught out, unarmoured, in an attack on his home or a private affray or murder.'

It seems a tragic end for a man who was evidently an important man and great benefactor of Norton Priory.

Buried in a stone coffin with a lid bearing two carved shields that once would have borne his heraldic device, he took pride of place in the nave of the Priory church.

Burial site: The undercroft of Norton Priory is the 13th century knight's final resting place - and he could be a man called Geoffrey Dutton

Curator Lynn Smith said: 'One character stands out as a strong possibility for being the occupant of this prestigious grave.

'That is Geoffrey Dutton, son of Adam de Dutton. We know he was born about AD 1170 and from skeletal evidence that he was 48 or over when he died.'

Whoever this poor man was, his story is one of many at Norton Priory which is the largest excavated monastic site in Europe.

A new research programme is hoped to reveal many more such stories. The skeleton is now back on display at Norton Priory Museum.
