Brazil legend Romario has proven his prowess for scoring is not just confined to the six-yard box after netting himself a stunning beauty almost 30-years younger than him.

The World Cup winner appears to have found love with 19-year-old American singer Dixie Pratt after proudly posting images of the pair all over social media as they holiday on the Caribbean island of Aruba.

The 48-year-old is understood to have met his teenage girlfriend in October 2014 following the end of his marriage to Isabella Bittencourt and uploading images of their daily lives have led to Pratt gaining over 13,000 new followers on her Instagram account.

An age gap of almost 30 years means that Pratt wasn't born when Romario won the World Cup in 1994

Although Romario remains a legend in Brazil, the irony of the 29-year age difference in his new relationship is that his young girlfriend was not even born when the prolific striker scored five goals to win his country the 1994 World Cup.

The former Barcelona star also won the FIFA World Player of the Year in the same year and continued playing into his late 40s to become the second most prolific goalscorer in football history (behind Austrian-Czech striker Josef 'Pepi' Bican) with over 1,000 strikes to his name.

Romario, who famously struck up a partnership with Bebeto during USA '94, scored 55 goals in 70 appearances for his country - making him the third-highest goalscorer in the Brazilian national team.

After starting his career in Brazil, Romario won league titles with both PSV Eindhoven and Barcelona in Europe before spending the majority of the rest of his career in his homeland where he won the Brazilian league title with Vasco da Gama.

Romario has since entered into the world of politics where he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies on the Brazilian Socialist Party and played a role in denouncing the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.
