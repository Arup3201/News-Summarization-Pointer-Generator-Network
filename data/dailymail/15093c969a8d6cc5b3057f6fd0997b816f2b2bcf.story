A hospital in Canada is treating a patient with flu-like symptoms similar to what an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus would look like.

The patient is being held in isolation at the Brampton Civic Hospital in Ontario after returning from a trip to Nigeria, which on Friday declared a state of emergency because of the disease.

'Initial signs and symptoms of Ebola are 
similar to many more common diseases,' cautioned Ontario's health minister, Eric Hoskins.

'One such disease relevant to 
African travel is malaria. There are currently no confirmed cases of 
Ebola in Ontario.'

Travel officials throughout the world have stepped up monitoring the spread of the disease, such as this South Korean quarantine officer checking the body temperature of a traveler

Health professionals in Canada have closely monitored the outbreak of the disease and are watching for passengers returning from West Africa.

Some 1,000 people have been killed since the virus emerged in Guinea in March, quickly spreading to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria.

There is no licensed treatment or vaccine for Ebola.

This is the largest and longest outbreak ever recorded of Ebola, which has a death rate of about 50 percent and has so far killed at least 932 people.

The World Health Organization declared similar emergencies for the swine flu pandemic in 2009 and for polio in May.

The WHO chief, Dr. Margaret Chan, said the announcement is 'a clear call for international solidarity' although she acknowledged that many countries would probably not have any Ebola cases.

'Countries affected to date simply do not have the capacity to manage an outbreak of this size and complexity on their own,' Chan told reporters in Geneva.

'I urge the international community to provide this support on the most urgent basis possible.'

In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have already elevated their Ebola response to the highest level and have recommended against traveling to West Africa.

On Thursday, CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden told a Congressional hearing that the current outbreak is set to sicken more people than all previous outbreaks of the disease combined.
