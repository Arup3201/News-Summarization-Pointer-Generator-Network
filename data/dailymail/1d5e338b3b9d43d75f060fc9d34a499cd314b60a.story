As the Bali Nine masterminds await their executions in Bali, a notorious Indonesian police chief sentenced to 15 years imprisonment has walked out of jail and returned home to his family.

The inequalities in the Indonesian prison system emerged when it was revealed on Tuesday afternoon that First Inspector Labora Sitorus, who was jailed last year for illegal logging and fuel hording, was refusing summons to go back to prison.

The revelation followed Monday's decision by the Indonesian government that Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will be in the next group of death row prisoners to be executed.

Indonesia's First Inspector Labora Sitorus walked out of jail after being sentenced to 15 years prison

The Bali Nine ringleaders, who are currently in their death row cells in Bali's Kerobokan Prison, have no hope of the same 'walk out' freedom the police inspector has experienced.

Inspector Sitorus told senior police in the region’s capital, Jayapura, that he had been lawfully released by prison officials - and waved a letter at them claiming it was his official release document, reported the Jakarta Globe.

Brigadier General Paulus Waterpauw, chief of West Papua Police, told the Jakarta Globe today that Sitorus had met two senior police officers at his home and he had refused to return to the jail with them.

‘He claims he has been released,’ said General Waterpauw.

‘Strangely, Labora has so far not been dismissed from the police force and apparently was allowed to leave prison in March 2014 for health reasons,’ said the Globe.

The Inspector was sentenced to eight years in prison for laundering $132 million, which was then revised to 15 years by the Supreme Court after he walked out of jail, reported the Jakarta Globe.

Indonesia's attorney-general has confirmed Australians Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan are in the next group of death row prisoners to be executed

Chan was arrested at the age of 21 for his role in the Bali Nine drug smuggling ring

‘He has not returned since and is now using a document from Sorong Penetentiary as proof that he doesn’t have to,' said General Waterpauw.

The General said that Inspector Sitorus was being protected by his family at his house, and that police were unable to forcefully take him to prison.

‘There are some of his relatives standing guard for him’ said the Police General. 

‘Not many, but we do not want this to lead to a clash. And there’s nothing we can do because he has a release letter.’ 

Attorney General Muhammad Prasetyo, who announced on Monday that Chan and Sukumaran would be in the next round of executions, 'indicated' that an investigation would be launched.

Inspector Sitorus' actions blatantly defy a Supreme Court ruling, reported news portal Detik.com.  

‘That’s what we need to find out - why he was released,’ Attorney General Prasetyo said.

‘The penetentiary has no authority to release him.’ 

The anomalies between the actions of the Police Inspector and the permanent incarceration of the Bali nine kingpins raises questions regarding the maintenance of control and equality within the Indonesian prison system.

Chan and Sukumaran have been on death row since 2006 and family and friends say they have totally reformed themselves since being behind bars. 

Under a ruling by Indonesia's Constitutional Court, a judicial review - which Chan and Sukumaran had asked for - could only be heard if new evidence is able to be presented.

But lawyers for the two men had pleaded for a second judicial review based on the way the the prisoners had changed since their drug arrests, pointing out they had helped many other prisoners.

Their application for a second judicial review, accepted by the courts on Friday, included handwritten pleas from the men, and accounts of their rehabilitation behind bars at Bali's Kerobokan jail. 

Indonesia's Attorney-General Mr Prasetyo said planning was underway for the executions: 'We're just waiting for the right time.' 

Chan and Sukumaran (above) are scheduled for execution and could face the firing squad next week
