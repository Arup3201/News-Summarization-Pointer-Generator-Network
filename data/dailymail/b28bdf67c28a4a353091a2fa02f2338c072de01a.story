Almost 30 protesters were arrested in three demonstrations on Tuesday in Chicago and Washington D.C., as police continued a crackdown on unruly Occupy Wall Street protesters across the U.S.

The arrests signal a hardening of the
position of both protesters and police as tension rise in demonstrations
away from where the movement first started in New York.

Five women aged between 55 and 80 were arrested in Chicago last night for taking rubbish from a foreclosed home owned by Bank of America and dumping it at one of the company’s branches.

Taken away: In Washington D.C. six people were arrested on Tuesday after 100 protesters unfurled upside-down flags - a symbol of distress - and anti-war banners in the atrium of a Senate office building

Chants: The group unfurled upside-down flags and anti-war banners in the atrium of the Hart Senate Office Building, which houses senators' personal offices and some committee rooms

Police presence: The protest had been planned for months by such anti-war groups as Veterans for Peace and Code Pink to mark the 10th anniversary of the invasion of Afghanistan

They were taken away as 21 economic 
protesters in total were arrested for trespassing in Illinois on Tuesday
and the Occupy Wall Street movement continued to gather pace in 
America's major cities.

office building.

Bill Clinton has hailed the Occupy Wall Street protests for stirring a 'good positive debate'.

The former president said the Occupy Wall 
Street movement reminded him of the Tea Party’s early days, with 
protesters saying: ‘There's something wrong with this country. This is 
not working for me’.

But
he added that the protesters must become more 
organised and come up with a better programme in order to have a bigger 
impact, reported the Chicago Tribune.

But in New York, where the protests started last month, the relationship between police and protesters has improved since 700 were arrested for blocking the Brooklyn Bridge two weeks ago and complained of brutal treatment.

Meanwhile the protests there have only got stronger, with the added celebrity backing of stars such as singer Kanye West this week.

The Occupy Wall Street demonstrators marched to 
the home of JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon on Tuesday - and today are gathering at the firm's headquarters in New York to protest.

The arrests in Chicago came one day after thousands of people including teachers and religious leaders marched and snarled rush-hour traffic while protesting unemployment and economic woes.

Those marches had appeared to target financial events in the city including a conference of the Mortgage Bankers Association, which was also subject to protesters' ire on Tuesday.

Sixteen were arrested for misdemeanour 
trespassing on Tuesday at a protest at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago 
where the a Mortgage Bankers Association conference was 
underway.

Bins: Five women aged between 55 and 80 were arrested in Chicago last night for taking rubbish from a foreclosed home owned by Bank of America and dumping it at one of the company's branches

Demonstration: Action Now, a group of working families, said Bank of America had not properly shuttered the foreclosed home from which the group took the furniture and garbage

Separately, five women from the Action 
Now group were arrested after taking rubbish from a foreclosed home 
owned by Bank of America and dumping it at a branch, the group's website
said.

'Since Bank of America will not go to our
neighbourhoods and clean up their vacant properties, Action Now members
brought the neighbourhood to them'

Action Now, a group of working families, said Bank of America had not properly shuttered the foreclosed home from which the group took the furniture and garbage.

‘Since Bank of America will not go to our neighbourhoods and clean up their vacant properties, Action Now members brought the neighbourhood to them,’ the group said on its website.

Bank of America has not yet commented. Chicago has also seen several weeks of daily protests outside the Federal Reserve Bank by ‘Occupy Chicago,’ an echo of the larger Wall Street protests.

Huge cheque: Protestors affiliated with the Occupy Wall Street protests chant outside the home of billionaire David Koch in New York on Tuesday

Placards: People representing Occupy Wall Street and other groups hold a march on the Upper East Side of Manhattan to protest policies they claim favour the super rich in New York

Beginnings: The Occupy Wall Street movement, which is protesting a wide variety of issues and started in September, is continuing in New York and is spreading to other cities around the country

Meanwhile in Washington D.C., six people were arrested on Tuesday during a protest in a Senate office building involving anti-war and Occupy DC demonstrators, police and participants said.

The group unfurled upside-down flags and anti-war banners in the atrium of the Hart Senate Office Building, which houses senators' personal offices and some committee rooms.

They chanted ‘We are the 99 per cent’ - reflecting their view that the country's wealthiest one per cent have too much and are too powerful - and ‘Stop the wars’ until Capitol police cleared the area.

The protest had been planned for months by such anti-war groups as Veterans for Peace and Code Pink to mark the 10th anniversary of the invasion of Afghanistan.

However the event drew participants as well from the Occupy DC protest, a local version of the anti-corporate Occupy Wall Street demonstrations that have spread nationwide.

On the floor: This protestor was one of around 100 arrested early on Tuesday morning after police cracked down on an Occupy Boston camp

Grabbed: These protesters were taken away from a section of the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Parkway

Force required: Many of the protesters refused to move from the camp and had to be forcibly removed by cops

Grounded: Protesters are arrested in Boston, after tensions boiled over on Tuesday morning when police arrested about 100 protesters from the Occupy Boston movement after the group expanded its camp

It comes after a huge crackdown on Occupy Boston’s second campsite that saw about 100 protesters arrested and their tents and personal belongings reportedly thrown into bins on Monday night.

They were arrested on Monday morning around 1:30am after they ignored warnings to move from a downtown greenway near where they have been camped out for more than a week, police said.

The protesters, part of the national Occupy Wall Street movement, had tried to expand from their original site in Dewey Square to a second site across the street, along the Rose Kennedy Greenway.

A local conservancy group recently planted $150,000 worth of shrubs along the greenway and officials said they were concerned about damage. The arrests were mostly for trespassing.

Police had warned protesters for hours they would have to return to Dewey Square, where a tent city has been steadily growing, and issued leaflets saying protesters could not occupy the greenway.
