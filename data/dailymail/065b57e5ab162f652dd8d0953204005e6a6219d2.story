Illinois Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth, a double amputee, has revealed that she is pregnant.

The 46-year-old Iraq veteran, who lost both of her legs and suffered serious injuries to her right arm while serving in 2004, announced she and her husband will welcome a baby girl in December.

'Bryan and I are expecting!' she wrote on her Facebook page on Monday. 'Thank you for your support and kind words during this exciting time in our lives.'

In a segment on the Today show on Monday, Duckworth revealed that she 'went through all the different varieties of IVF' before conceiving and admitted it was hard to keep the process quiet.

Good news: Iraq veteran and Illinois Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth, pictured left and right with her husband Bryan Bowlsbey, has announced that they are expecting their first baby - a girl - this December

The baby girl will be her first child with husband Bryan Bowlsbey, whom she met at George Washington University and married in 1993. He is a Major in the National Guard.

Due to her age, her pregnancy is considered high risk, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. 

Duckworth was flying a Black Hawk helicopter over Iraq on November 12, 2004 when she was shot down by a rocket-propelled grenade, losing both of her legs and shattering her right arm.

After returning to the U.S. and learning how to walk with the help of prosthetics, she worked for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and as the Director of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs between 2006 and 2009. She was elected to Congress in 2012.

Service: Duckworth is pictured serving with the Illinois Army National Guard during her tour of duty in Iraq. In 2004, she lost both legs when the helicopter she was in was shot down on a mission near Baghdad

Duckworth, who was born in Thailand to an American U.S. Marine Corps father, is the first disabled female veteran and the first female Asian American from Illinois to serve in the House.

She is also one of five female veterans who lost limbs in Iraq and, coincidentally, four of them are pregnant or recently gave birth, the Today show reported.

Melissa Stockwell, who lost most of her left leg from a roadside bomb in 2004 before going on to compete in the 2008 Paralympics, also appeared on the show. Her son is due in November.

'Tammy and I as being lower limb amputees I think very initially wondered if it would be possible to have children and learned pretty quickly you can still have children and provide, but I think you have to find yourself first,' Stockwell said.

Band of mothers: On Monday, she appeared on the Today show with fellow veteran amputees, Melissa Stockwell, left, who is also expecting a baby, and Dawn Halfaker, right, who gave birth four months ago

They appeared on the show beside Dawn Halfaker, who lost an arm in Iraq, and who is now mother to a four-month-old boy.

Then finally, Danielle Green-Byrd, who lost an arm during combat in 2004 before helping vets with PTSD, gave birth to a son 10 days ago. 

'These women were there for me as the band of sisters when I went through the greatest pain, the greatest trauma in my life,' Duckworth said. 'And now we get to be together for the time of greatest joy.'
