A Queensland woman hopes to become the youngest Australian to climb Mount Everest when she tackles the monster trek in two months.

Alyssa Azar, 18, has been climbing since she was five, mainly because her father, Glenn, is a Kokoda Track instructor.

At just eight years old, she successfully completed on the iconic trail in Papua with his help.

Ms Azar hopes to become the youngest Australian to climb the world's highest peak

She has gone on to climb Africa's Mount Kilimanjaro, the 10 highest peaks in Australia, South America's Mount Aconcagua in the Andes, and Nepal's Ama Dablam and Manaslu.

'I started doing training when I was five or six,' Ms Azar told Daily Mail Australia.

'As I got older I got onto the higher altitudes.

'After Kilimanjaro in 2011, I decided I wanted to be a professional mountaineer... and put myself against the best.'

Since climbing Mount Kilimanjaro in 2011, the teenager has been training to summit the Nepal mountain

She has been training hard, with her own equipment in the backyard (left) in Toowoomba in Queensland's south east, including a rope climb (right)

The 18-year-old caught the climbing bug largely due to her father, Glenn, who is a Kokoda Track guide

On Friday, Ms Azar will make her second expedition to conquer the world's highest peak, which stands at 8,848 metres above sea level.

Last year the Toowoomba teenager was unsuccessful when an avalanche struck just days out from her planned climb and 16 Sherpa guides were killed.

But the tragedy has not deterred her as the mountaineer attempts the summit again.

If Ms Azar makes it to the top, she will beat the record set by Rex Pemberton, 21, who climbed Mt Everest in 2005.

Since then the determined girl went on to complete many more feats before wanting to tackle Mt Everest

She is pictured here climbing Mt Kilimanjaro in 2011. It was after this trek that she decided to take on her biggest challenge

The 18-year-old has been training for the climb for years and has a set up in her backyard, which includes a rope climb.

'[I do] endurance work, I do a little of indoor rock climbing... and I do a lot of basic workouts like swimming and running as well,' Ms Azar told Daily Mail Australia.

'It’s been a long time coming now and I'm ready to go and climb the mountain.'

Ms Azar will fly into Lukla - a town in Nepal's north-east - and spend the first nine days of her two-month expedition trekking to base camp, which she describes as a 'comfortable trek'.

Ms Azar said she had decided to come a professional mountaineer and has climbed up Nepal's Ama Dablam and Manaslu

Here she is trekking up South America's Mount Aconcagua in the Andes at 4,200 metres

Her two-month expedition will take her from Lukla - in Nepal's north-east - and will take her 8,848 metres above sea level

It will take her nine days to make the journey from the Nepalese town to the base camp of Mt Everest

Ms Azar said she loved mountaineering as it gave her a sense of adventure and let her experience nature

'We start at [an altitude of] 3,000 metres in Lukla so we can adapt to the altitude and when we get to base camp it'll be 5,000 metres,' she said.

Ms Azar, who describes herself as an introvert, said she loved mountaineering as it gave her a sense of adventure.

'I get really excited going to see new places and I like the intensity of Everest,' she said.

'I'm genuinely more introverted day-to-day... and you get to be in your own head space. 

'The realness of environment is definitely part of it as well.'
