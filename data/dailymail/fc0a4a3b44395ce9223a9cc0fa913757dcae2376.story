Cristiano Ronaldo's ex-girlfriend Irina Shayk has taken a swipe at her former partner, claiming she felt 'ugly standing next to the wrong man'.

The Real Madrid superstar often gets tongues wagging when it comes to his relationships, and there was much media speculation over the reasons for his split with Shayk in January.  

Now, in an interview with Spanish magazine Hola, Shayk has spoken out about her 'ideal man', with some claiming that her words are an attack on the 30-year-old world player of the year.

'My ideal man is faithful, honest and a gentleman who knows how to treat women. I don't believe in men who make us feel unhappy, because they're boys not men.

'I thought I had once found the ideal man but it didn't turn out that way.'

She added: 'I think a woman feels ugly when she's got the wrong man at her side. I've felt ugly and insecure.'
