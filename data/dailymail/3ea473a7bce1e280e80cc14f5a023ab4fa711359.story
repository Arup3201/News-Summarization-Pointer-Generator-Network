An extra has been stabbed in the shoulder with a bayonet on the set of a World War Two epic starring Brad Pitt and Shia LeBeouf, MailOnline can reveal.

An air ambulance helicopter was flown to Watlington, Oxfordshire, where Fury is being filmed, and the victim, a man in his thirties, was rushed to hospital.

He was apparently stabbed with a bayonet at just before midday today but his injuries are not thought to be serious.

It is understood he was hurt accidentally, and not in an attack. It is not known if Mr Pitt, 49, and Mr LeBeouf, 27, witnessed the stabbing.

Officers from Thames Valley Police went to the fields where the war movie is being filmed until mid-November, but are not treating the incident as a crime.

'At 11.41am today we were called to a film set having been told a man had been stabbed.

'He had an injury to his shoulder and was taken to hospital for treatment. His injuries are not thought to be serious.'

A spokesman for the Oxfordshire Air Ambulance added: 'Thames Valley and Chiltern Air Ambulance were called to Watlington in Oxfordshire.

'A male patient, believed to be in their 30s, was airlifted to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford'.

As with incidents of this sort the police have informed the Health and Safety Executive, who may now investigated what happened. They have confirmed that their initial probe has started.

MailOnline understands the person injured is not a star of the film.

Fury, which is scheduled to hit cinemas in November 2014, tells the story of a crew of a Sherman tank taking on a dangerous mission in the final weeks of the war.

Written by director David Ayer, the film sees the crew take on a German division facing an almost hopeless battle.

Residents in the village of Shirburn have received leaflets from the film’s producers warning them to expect noise including gunfire and explosions.

Local Sue Ford complained: 'I've heard gunfire which is quite startling. Very frightening. The tanks are incredibly noisy.'

While Kim Emerson said villagers were taking it in their stride: 'We're kind of lucky enough that we live in a semi-film set.

'There's always something going on whether it's Midsomers… Sherlock Holmes… so we're kind of getting pretty used to it now.'

To prepare for the role of 
battle-hardened Sergeant Wardaddy, Mr Pitt, 49, was spotted getting tank driving
lessons through the countryside accompanied by instructors when filming
first began last year.
