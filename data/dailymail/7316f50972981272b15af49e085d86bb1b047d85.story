A British boy was left critically ill in a Turkish hospital as doctors fought to save his legs - after he was crushed by a careering car during a holiday stroll.

Mark Lalor-Smith, ten, was rushed to intensive care at the Akdeniz University Hospital in Antalya to be treated for severe injuries after the out-of-control car crushed him against a wall on Monday.

He is understood to be on his way back to Britain for more specialist treatment.

Harrowing amateur video footage of the aftermath of the horror crash, played on a Turkish website, shows young Mark laying prone in the road while his distraught father Julian and mother Sara cradle him in their arms.

A female British voice can be heard shouting threats at the driver responsible for the horror crash, while Mr Lalor-Smith, 54, a senior civil servant on the Isle of Man, tends to his son.

In the video Mark is lying immobile while a pool of blood spreads beneath him.

The sun is shining, but tears and cries of anguish fill the air as the family desperately seek help, imploring passers by to phone an ambulance.

Mark had set out for a holiday walk in the sunshine with his parents and twin siblings, Terence and Courtney, 11, to get from their hotel in Fethiye in Antalya on the Mediterraean coast, to a nearby restaurant.

According to eye-witness Ugur Etiman, the car driver responsible lost control and crashed into a van before spinning into Mark and slamming him into a wall.

Mrs Etiman said the scene was ‘horrible’ and described Mark’s legs as ‘torn’.  A passing Danish tourist administered first aid to Mark at the scene.

Mark was rushed to the local Lokman 
Hekim hospital in Fethiye (pictured) where he was stabilised before being

Turkey’s south coast

Mark was rushed to the local Lokman Hekim hospital in Fethiye where he was stabilised before being transferred 125miles to the regional university teaching hospital on Turkey’s south coast.

A spokeswoman for the Akdeniz University Hospital confirmed:  ‘Mark is currently in intensive care.  He’s suffered extensive injuries to both legs but the doctors are currently trying to repair his arteries and restore blood supply to his feet. 

'They are doing everything they can to repair the damage and save his legs. It’s too early to say the outcome. 

‘His parents, Sarah and Julian  are with him and are in constant contact with the doctors about his progress any decisions about amputation will be made in consultation with them.’

The family declined to comment.

But Turkish video footage last night showed Mr Lalor-Smith and the rest of the family pacing up and down nervously in the hospital where young Mark is being treated.

And on Mrs Lalor-Smith’s Facebook page – which is covered with happy photographs of the family together – she makes clear that they had happy holiday experiences in Fethiye in the past.

She had last October written to an American friend living in Fethiye, saying excitedly ‘Just looking at flights for next year!’

Among Mrs Lalor-Smith’s friends is an instructor at a surf school in the town.

Idyllic: But the family's holiday in Fethiye turned into a nightmare following the horrific accident

He and his family live in Foxdale on the island. On an internet profile Mr Lalor-Smith says he and the family enjoy walking their four West Highland Terriers, and that his is a committed member of the leadership of his church.

Last night Isle of Man Home Afffairs minister Juan Watterson said: 'Julian is a popular officer within the department of home affairs - and our thoughts and prayers are with him.'

Fethiye is a popular resort on Turkey’s south west coast.

Known as part of the so-called Turkish Riviera, it has been increasingly thronged by British tourists over the last decade.

Just 30 mins from the resort airport of Dalaman the population of the original fishing port swells from its 70,000 residents in the winter to hosting more than half-a-million visitors each summer.

The majority of tourists are British followed by Russian and Sweden – with many Brits loving the climate so much that they have recently bought property in the town, developing British ex-pat enclaves in suburbs such as Calis Beach and Hisaronu.

Olu Deniz bay, the poster beach of Turkey is ten miles out of Fethiye.  

But the town has seen its fair share of tragedy involving the Britons that flock there each summer.

In Aug 2009 British tourist John Kirkham disappeared while walking the famous Lycian Way – a Roman route from Fethiye to Antalya.  His body was discovered months later where he had fallen into a dried up river bed.

And the following year in July 2010 little Cerys Matthews, nine, who was holidaying in Fethiye died in a white water rafting tragedy.

Despite the tragic holiday deaths many Brits have been surprised and impressed by the excellent standard of care provided by the Turkish emergency services – particularly the paramedics and state of the art hospitals.
