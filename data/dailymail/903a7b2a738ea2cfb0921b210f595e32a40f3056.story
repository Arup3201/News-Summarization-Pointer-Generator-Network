An amazing set of pictures has given a new, rare glimpse into the lives of 1960s mining communities both in and out of the pits.

The retro images show the working and social lives of the pit men proving that although the work was hard, they enjoyed lively 'out of hours' entertainment.

The photos shine a light on the mining communities of Horden in County Durham and Workington in Cumbria, showing how the miners enjoyed their time off from the harsh conditions underground.

Miners, who are covered in dust and soot, help each other to get clean in the showers after their shift at Horden Colliery in County Durham. Despite the hard work underground extracting the coal, the men seem to be in good spirits

Men still wearing their safety hats and head lamps gather around to listen to the speaker at a National Coal Miners' Union meeting in Workington, Cumbria in 1963. The economy of the town of Workington was highly dependent on the coal industry during the 1960s 

The rare images also show the miners outside of work, enjoying a drink at a local working men's club in Horden while listening to an entertainer, left, with others playing a game of dominoes, right 

The pictures come from the 1960s at a time when coal mining was the lifeblood of many small towns.

But they show that despite the difficult work, many embraced a community spirit with the miners and their families socialising in the back streets and working men's clubs.

And amid the sombre and severe light, it shows the workers in good spirits relaxing and showering after a hard day's work.

It even shows how many enjoyed a drink and entertainment in their local working men's club as well as playing dominoes and tending to their racing pigeons.

Meanwhile their children can be seen happy playing in the narrow back streets of their miners terraced houses.

The collection of photos by awarding winning photographer Patrick Ward will be on display at the National Coal Museum in West Yorkshire, until January 2015.

Mr Ward began his photography career in the 1960s, working for many newspapers, magazines and journals.

The new exhibition also coincides with the launch of his new book called 'Being English'.

The book showcases a collection of Mr Ward's work and explores the eccentricities of life in England.

As well as dog racing, other miners spent their time enjoying pigeon racing. Here, one miner from Horden Colliery tends to his homing pigeons who are fluttering around their bird shed 

Many of the miners families also socialised together, with many living side by side in miners' terraced houses. Left, boys playing in the back streets of Workington pose for a picture, while right, a teenager miner in Horden heads home after finishing his shift
