Outraged fans took to Facebook this week after the Home & Garden Channel suggested using an American flag as a tablecloth for a Fourth of July party.

As part of a slideshow on its website titled 'Simply Chic Fourth of July Entertaining Ideas', Ole Glory was pictured underneath plates of fruit and a bowl of lemonade.

'Drape a large American flag over the table as a bright and festive table runner. Use a nylon flag so spills can be easily wiped off and the flag can later be hung with pride on a flag pole,' the caption read, according to multiple posts on Facebook.

'Disrespectful': HGTV viewers were outraged after the channel suggested using an American flag as a tablecloth during Forth of July parties in a slideshow on their website

Apology: HGTV responded on Facebook to the dozens of post decrying their suggestion that the American flag could be used as a tablecloth during parties

'Using an American flag as a table cloth dishonors all Americans who love
Old Glory — especially those who gave their lives defending it. No one 
dies for a table cloth,' one post wrote on the channel's page.

After dozens of posts decrying the suggestion, HGTV issued an apology on their Facebook page Wednesday afternoon and removed the image from the slideshow.

'HGTV Fans, regarding the recent article that appeared on our website...This was a regrettable use of our flag and it never should have happened,' the channel's apology read. 'We sincerely apologize and have removed the post from our website. We want to assure our fans that HGTV is proud of the American flag and everything it symbolizes for our people.'

Before the apology was posted, Facebook users were enraged.

'Many heroes died protecting the USA flag. and you show that level of disrespect for it?!! . its NOT a decoration!! it should be shown respect and dignity, not a spill catcher,' one post read.

Many noted they served in the military, lost someone in the military or have family and friends who are veterans or currently serving.

Respect: One user tells HGTV the American flag is 'not a tablecloth' and demands the channel respect Ole Glory

Party: The suggestion was posted in a slideshow called 'Simply Chic Fourth of July Entertaining Ideas' that had other, less offensive, decorating suggestions like this traditional tablecloth

'HGTV, boy did you mess up when you used the American flag as a tablecloth,' one HGTV reader posted. 'As the mother of a fallen soldier, I am offended that the American flag means so little to HGTV.'

'After recently seeing a flag draped over my husband's casket I can't imagine setting one out as a tablecloth,' another said.

Many pointed out that the flag's use in the picture appeared to have violated U.S. Code, which says 'no disrespect should be shown to the flag of the United States of America'.

U.S. Code also stipulates that the flag should never touch anything beneath it, like a table.

'The flag should never be fastened, displayed, used, or stored in such a manner as to permit it to be easily torn, soiled, or damaged in any way,' the code also stipulates.

While there is no punishment for violating flag code, as a tablecloth for a party, it's likely a flag would be spilled on—which HGTV even noted in the original caption. 

Many on Facebook didn't appear satisfied by the apology.

'Until I see in the news that you have fired the people responsible for using the American flag as a tablecloth, I will not even consider tuning in to your channel,' wrote one commenter. '...So many people are so totally clueless how insulting, how disrespectful, and how unamerican this is.'

Other users noted this Friday is Flag Day.
