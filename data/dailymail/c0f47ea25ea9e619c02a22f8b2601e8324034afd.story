China has drastically slashed the number of 'trashy' entertainment programmes shown on TV.

The State Administration of Radio, Film and Television (SARFT) claims two-thirds of programming classified as crass and deemed to pollute the minds of the masses have been axed from country’s 34 satellite channels.

The airings of 'vulgar' game and talent shows, dating competitions and soap operas containing 'excessive entertainment' have plummeted from 126 a week to just 38, according to the country's strict broadcasting watchdog.

'Low taste' talk shows and Jeremy Kyle-styled chat formats featuring real life stories of emotional upheaval and daily strife have also been banned or heavily restricted.

In there place during the 7.30-10pm primetime viewing slot are strictly-government approved programmes - including extra state-sanctioned news and current affairs items. 

'Satellite channels have started to broadcast programmes that promote traditional virtues and socialist core values,' watchdog officials said in a statement.

The regulator ordered the initiative in October and the announcement of is swift success follows this week's warning from President Hu Jintao that Western culture was out to attack and divide China.  

The new rules to slash the popular shows became law from January 1.

Each of the country's 34 satellite channels is now only permitted to show two entertainment programmes per week.  

And only 90 minutes of 'entertainment content' is allowed every day from 7.30 to 10p.m.  

Hugely popular dating shows such as If You Are The One, and soap operas are still allowed to be shown – but only during weekend primetime.

A popular annual talent show Super Girl - inspired by the UK’s Pop Idol - was axed by government officials last September.

The programme was watched by 400 million who were glued to their TV sets for three hours watching women of all ages compete in a singing contest.

Officials said the show  'poisoned the country’s youth' and was 'too long'.

But it was widely believed the high ratings and democratic overtones during the viewers’ vote for their favourite candidate spooked the Communist-run Government.   

Since Beijing partly opened the TV market to more competition, scores of new satellite stations have flourished.

Most have proved more popular with their cheaply made programmes than state-run TV channels that spend millions on lavish period dramas, many of which are loaded with government propaganda.   

In his article published in the ruling Communist Party’s member’s magazine 'Seeking the Truth', President Hu warned against hostile Western forces trying to split and divide China via a policy of cultural genocide.

He called on his government to promote its own red culture both domestically and overseas.
