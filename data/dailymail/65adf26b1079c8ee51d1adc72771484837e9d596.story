Plans to film the third series of hit TV show Homeland in Israel have been cancelled over concerns about the political situation in Syria.

Makers of the drama starring Damian Lewis and Claire Danes had intended to film parts of the show's third season in Israel, where parts of the first two seasons were shot.

But at the weekend the American producers told the Israeli production company that was arranging locations and shoots that they would be filming in Morocco instead because of security fears.

Homeland, starring (L-R) Damian Lewis, Claire Danes and Mandy Patinkin, will not now be shot in Israel

Fears of a Syrian retaliation over potential military action by the U.S. have been growing in Israel in recent weeks, and there have been reports of nervous civilians buying gas masks and preparing air raid shelters.

Morocco is seen as a more stable location, and Homeland's creators Howard Gordon and Gideon Raff are working on another project, a separate series called Tyrant, that is also due to be filmed there.

But the last minute decision - Homeland executives announced plans to film in Tel Aviv only two months ago - has upset television producers in Israel.

One source told Israeli news source Ynet: 'We were already getting organized, we even received scripts, and in the end we were told that the shooting had been moved. It's frustrating.'

The Israeli production company is expected to be tens of thousands of dollars out of pocket as a result to cancel filming in Tel Aviv.

The third series will begin in the U.S. later this month and will be aired in the UK in October.

Homeland producers were criticised by Lebanese tourist officials a year ago over their portrayal of 'Beirut' as a terrorist-ridden slum which they said was far from the truth

Makers of the Emmy Award-winning show were criticised a year ago by Lebanese tourism officials for portraying Beirut as a city packed with terrorists.

Faty Abboud, the minister for tourism, threatened legal action after an episode in the second series showed a part of the city looking shoddy and dangerous, when in fact it is filled with luxury boutiques.

To make matters worse, the episode had been filmed in Israel, rather than Beirut.Â  Gideon Raff, director and screenwriter, is Israeli and therefore unable to enter Lebanon.
