Europe's tallest skyscraper, which will stand more than 70 metres higher than the Shard, is going to be built in a sleepy Swiss village.

Plans for the 80-storey luxury hotel tower, designed by Los Angeles architect Thom Mayne, have been unveiled for the tiny hamlet of Vas, in the Swiss Alps.

Standing at 381 metres (1250ft) tall, the slim, glassy skyscraper aims to mirror the surrounding mountainous landscape.

Plans for the 80-storey luxury hotel tower have been created by award-winning Los Angeles architect Thom Mayne

The building will feature a slim, glass design to allow it to blend in the with the stunning scenery in the Swiss Alps

The 53,000-square-metre building will include 107 guest rooms and suites, as well as spas, a ballroom and a library, restaurants, a cafe, bar, sky bar and a gallery.

It will also feature a swimming pool and fitness centre.

Mayne's architect firm Morphosis won a competition sponsored by a resort in the Swiss town for the hotel which they hope to open in 2019, when it should be the continent's tallest—unless a planned tower in St. Petersburg assumes its full projected height.

Mayne is known for his focus on the incorporation of light in his building designs, seen in his plans for the new tower

The building will be part of the Vals resort, which already includes a hotel as well as a world-famous spa building by Swiss architect Peter Zumthor.

Mayne told Dezeen maagzine that each floor would have just one room offering exclusive panoramic views of the Alps.

'As much as possible, the hotel is a minimalist act that re-iterates the site and offers to the viewer a mirrored, refracted perspective of the landscape,' said Mayne. 

The tallest building in the world is the Burj Khalifa or 'Khalifa Tower' in Dubai which stands at 829.8 m (2,722 ft) high.

In Europe, currently the tallest structure is The Federation Tower in Moscow, Russia which measures at 373.7m (1,227ft) tall.

Thom Mayne is responsible for some of the world's most iconic buildings including the Sun Tower in Seoul, Korea and the Perot Museum of Nature and Science in Dallas, Texas.

Based in Los Angeles, the principal of architectural firm Morphosis, has won the Rome Prize Fellowship and Pritzker Prize among many.

The American architect is known for his bold and unconventional works, in particular the buildings' offset angular forms, layered exterior walls, incorporation of giant letter and number graphics.

In recent years, his firm's architecture has created more layered visual effects which has been made possible increasingly through computer design techniques, which simplify the construction of complex forms.

Mayne also has a focus emphasis on natural light within all of his designs.

In January this year, he was at the centre of controversy after buying and demolishing the house that noted writer Ray Bradbury had lived in for 50 years.

Mayne began work under Korean-born architect Ki Suh Park after graduating. 

In 1972, Mayne, Livio Santini, James Stafford and Michael Brickler founded Morphosis. The group spent their free time experimenting with new inventions for their clients, whom consisted of friends and parents of students.

The firm's design philosophy arises from an interest in producing work with a meaning that can be understood by absorbing the culture for which it was made, and their goal was to develop an architecture that would eschew the normal bounds of traditional forms

Its first official commission was a school in Pasadena, attended by Mayne's son

Publicity from this project led to a number of residential commissions, including the Lawrence Residence. 

The firm has grown into prominent design practice, with completed projects worldwide.

Thom Mayne has also become a primary architect for federal projects.

Recent commissions include: graduate housing at the University of Toronto; the San Francisco Federal Building; the University of Cincinnati Student Recreation Center; the Science Center School in Los Angeles, Diamond Ranch High School in Pomona, California; and the Wayne L. Morse United States Courthouse in Eugene, Oregon.

Current projects include  Vialia Vigo, Vigo, Galicia, Spain, 2016 , Phare Tower, La Défense, Paris, France, 2017 and Cornell NYC Tech, Roosevelt Island, New York, 2017.
