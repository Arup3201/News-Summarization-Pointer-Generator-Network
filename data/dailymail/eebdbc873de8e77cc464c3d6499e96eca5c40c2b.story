Alan Barnfield is accused of having sex with a pony

A man accused of having sex with a Shetland pony was found by police sweating profusely and smelling strongly of horses. 

Alan Barnfield, described as a 'sexual deviant' was seen leading a Shetland pony and another animal into a dark wooded area at the end of a paddock in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, where he allegedly had sex with them.

Police found Barnfield smelling strongly of horses. 

The 44-year-old was also equipped with a rucksack containing several cans of Lynx deodorant, a length of white electrical cable, a handheld water sprayer, a cloth, a metal dog chain and two bottles of Lucozade. 

DNA from one of the ponies, called Sky, was found on Barnfield. 

He also had images and videos of bestiality on his mobile phone.

Sky was found by its owner Jodie Walton in discomfort the day after the alleged sexual attack. 

A vet was called to examine the animal at Oak Tree Stables in Doncaster, South Yorkshire.

Officers had been called by worried residents after they saw Barnfield leading the horses into a dark wooded area and they were concerned he was trying to steal them

Louise Reevell, prosecuting, told Sheffield Crown Court that Barnfield was spotted putting something around the neck of the Shetland pony and leading it and another horse to the darkened end of the paddock.

The alleged incident took place at around half past midnight on August 8 2012.

Ms Reevell said: 'It is at this time the prosecution say that intercourse took place out of sight in a dark wooded area at the end of the paddock.'

Barnfield had denied sexual intercourse with an animal and told the court he was out walking at the time 

Barnfield, of Doncaster, is currently on trial at Sheffield Crown Court for sexual intercourse with an animal 

Barnfield, of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, said he was 'just out walking' and denies sexual intercourse with an animal.

The trial continues.
