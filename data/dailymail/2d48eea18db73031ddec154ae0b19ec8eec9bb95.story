There will be two teams in Tallinn on Sunday but Mart Poom plans to inspire Estonia’s players with his tale of the day there was only one, and how it triggered his move to the Barclays Premier League and three encounters with the Queen.

It is 18 years since the farcical World Cup qualifier that never was against Scotland and Poom is back in the Estonian capital.

He works among other things as goalkeeper coach for the team which faces England in the Le Coq Arena and believes this can be the campaign when his country reaches its first major finals as an independent nation.

But before they step out to face Roy Hodgson’s team of Premier League stars, the former Derby, Sunderland, Arsenal and Watford goalkeeper will remind them to seize the moment and trust in fate as he did when Estonia replayed that game against the Scots.

‘It was all very bizarre,’ said Poom. ‘That’s how I came about my chance and you never know if we had played the original game if that chance would have come. That’s how life goes. You have to take chances when you get them.

‘I will say the same thing when our lads go out against England. This is a great chance. Go out and make a name for yourselves.’

It was October 1996 and the story begins with Scotland complaining about the lights after a training session on the eve of the game.

‘We were playing in our old stadium and the temporary floodlights had been brought in from Finland,’ said Poom. ‘Scotland started to complain but we never believed they would change the kick-off time on the day of the game.

‘We got up and trained in the morning. Then we heard the kick-off had been brought forward to 3pm. But no-one could believe it was possible. We were at out training camp (60 miles from the city) and all the kit was there. We stuck to the original plan and went to the stadium for a kick off at 6.45pm.

‘It was a mistake by UEFA. We were a new nation and they thought they could do what they wanted with us. At first Scotland thought they had won. But common sense appeared and they made us replay.’

When Scotland took to the field and kicked off alone at 3pm, the Tartan Army sang: ‘There’s only one team in Tallinn’. Initially, there were reports that Craig Brown’s team would be awarded a 3-0 win, but Estonia fought their corner and won the right to a replay.

It was played four months later, in Monaco, by which time Derby manager Jim Smith was searching a new goalkeeper. Smith had signed Poom once before and called his old mate Alan Hodgkinson, then Scotland’s goalkeeping coach, to run the rule over him again.

‘I first signed for Portsmouth in ’94 when Jim was the manager,’ said Poom. ‘I came in from Wil in the Swiss first division and it was a big jump for me. There were very few foreigners in English football at the time. Pompey were in the Championship and a few eyebrows were raised when an Estonian goalkeeper arrived.

‘I couldn’t push Alan Knight from the No 1 spot and Estonia wasn’t EU at the time. My work permit wasn’t renewed and I returned to Estonia in ’96 but Jim kept an eye on me.’

Poom performed well in a goalless draw in front of fewer than 4,000 in Monaco and Hodgkinson’s report sparked the move to Derby.

He made his debut at Manchester United in the same game as Paulo Wanchope, who stole the show with a solo wonder-goal, stayed for six years and brought Pride Park to its feet when he scored the only goal of his career - a fabulous header - when he returned with Sunderland.

‘That was a special moment, because of the circumstances,’ said Poom. ‘When I left Derby I didn’t really have chance to say goodbye and on my first time back I scored an equaliser for Sunderland in the last minute.

‘I didn’t really celebrate but it was a great feeling. The goal was one thing but the reception after the final whistle was something else. I got a standing ovation from both sets of fans. I had a special relationship with the club.

‘My best years were probably at Derby and of course I am really honoured to be able to say I met Her Majesty three times. We exchanged a few pleasantries. She asked how long I’d been in England.’

Poom first met the Queen when she opened Pride Park and again when she was on her Golden Jubilee tour of Britain and he was one of the players selected to meet her when she was in Derbyshire. 

The third time was when the Arsenal players went to Buckingham Palace. The Queen had missed an appointment to open the Emirates Stadium because of a bad back so she invited Arsene Wenger’s squad to the Palace a few months later.

During two years at Arsenal he also pocketed a Champions League runners-up medal. He was in the squad as cover and did not play but it was a nice souvenir as reward for putting Estonia on the map, at least as far as English football fans were concerned.

He was in goal, eight years ago, when England were last in Tallinn. ‘Beaten by David Beckham’s crossing,’ recalled the 42-year-old, drily, when asked about the 3-0 defeat. It was the same score in the return at Wembley four months later.

Poom runs a coaching school in the city these days and works in the Estonian FA’s coach education programme but will be on the touchline tomorrow, part of Magnus Pehrsson’s coaching team as they try to recover from defeat in Lithuania on Thursday.

‘We saw the most important game as the one against Lithuania but everyone is up for England,’ said Poom. ‘The nation is looking forward to it. Tickets sold out very quickly. It’s not a big stadium, about a 10,000 capacity but people are close to the pitch and it will be a great atmosphere, like the older grounds in England.

‘Our only chance is to stick to the game-plan, be disciplined and really fight. We have spirit and the new qualifying format is better for smaller nations like Estonia. Players and fans all have higher expectations. In the last Euros we were close. We got to the play-offs and lost to Ireland. We have a chance. We can do this.’
