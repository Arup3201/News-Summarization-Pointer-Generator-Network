A pair of sisters are celebrating after both giving birth to baby girls just hours apart in the same hospital.

Inseparable siblings Kirsty and Mica Higham were delighted when they became pregnant at around the same time.

And the pair joked that the â€˜race was on' - but were stunned when they both went into labour on the same day.

They never imagined that their double deliveries would spark the ultimate family celebration with the arrival of their daughters within hours of each other at Salford Royal.

Eldest sister Kirsty, 27, from Swinton, gave birth to baby Delilah, weighing in at 7lbs 1oz, at 1.58am last Tuesday.

Then new mother Mica, 19, from Pendleton, followed suit with baby Pixie, weighing 5lbs 10oz, at 7.14pm.

Kirsty, who was already a mother-of-two, beamed: 'We were both in a slow labour that lasted two days and we joked that the race was on to have our babies.

'We said we might end up in a birthing pool together but didn't imagine that we really would give birth on the same day.

'I ended up four days overdue and Mica was five days early so we met in the middle.'

And the sisters have definitely beat the odds, as bookmakers Ladbrokes put the odds of two sisters giving birth on the same day at 2,000-1.

They both found out that they were expecting girls at a scan early in their pregnancies and both went into labour on Sunday, August 24.

Kirsty, who also has two sons Caleb, seven, and five-year-old Nile, was admitted to hospital last Monday and gave birth in the early hours of Tuesday.

Mica was admitted later on on Tuesday and gave birth on the same day.

The sisters' paths didn't cross in hospital because Kirsty had been discharged by the time Mica gave birth.

But mother Gillian Shaw, now a proud grandmother of 10, kept them informed via text message.

Kirsty added: 'My mum joked that she wished she had put a bet on us having a baby the same day now.

'We are close and when we found out we were both pregnant we went for all our scans together.We both gave birth naturally using gas and air.'

Mica said: 'It helped my sister being pregnant at the same time because we could support each other.

'And it's special that our daughters will grow up together and will the share the same birthday.'
