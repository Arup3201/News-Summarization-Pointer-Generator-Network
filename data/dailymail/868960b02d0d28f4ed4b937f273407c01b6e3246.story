Rio Ferdinand clearly knows how to hold his own as the former England and Manchester United defender steps off the football pitch - and into the UFC Octagon.

The incredible footage shows Sportsmail's World Cup columnist going from playing a video game to trying the real thing, and getting knocked to the canvas by a surprise punch to the face from British UFC star Brad Pickett.

But Ferdinand, currently acting as a pundit for BBC, didn't forget his loyalty to United in the ad for EA Sports, as he turns down blue tape in favour of red.

It's on: Ferdinand may not be at the World Cup with England but the defender looks in good shape

Ferdinand, a Mail on Sunday columnist, has been taking to social networking to show off his time in Rio, posting with the hashtag '#rioinrio'.

The centre-back is a free agent after leaving United at the end of last season and has been linked with QPR, Aston Villa, as well as other clubs in the USA and Turkey.

But he certainly looked in good nick as he continues to prepare for next season, wherever he may find himself.

EA SPORTS UFC is available now for Xbox One and PlayStation 4
