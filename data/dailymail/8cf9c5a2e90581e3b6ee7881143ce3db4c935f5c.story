Young people who grow up in an unstable household are twice as likely to leave school with no good GCSEs, according to the Prince’s Trust.

Those without a good education are also more likely to have been read fewer bedtime stories and to have had less support at home than their more successful peers, its research shows.

It also suggests the parents of those aged 16-25 with no A* to C grade GCSEs are less likely to help with their child’s homework. The survey found stability at  home was linked to success in  later life, according to the  charity’s fourth annual Youth  Happiness Index.

GCSE students are more likely to achieve better grades if they receive additional supported at home

Nearly half (45 per cent) of all high-achieving 16- to 25-year-olds said someone at home always helped them with their schoolwork, as opposed to 38 per cent of those with no qualifications.

Those with no good GCSEs were less than half as likely to have someone read to them as the  average young person, according to the YouGov survey.

Milburn is encouraging parents to be more involved in their children's education

he lack of routine also impacted upon their mental health, with the number of those with no qualifications three times more likely to be depressed than their well-educated peers.

One in three of those with lower qualifications ‘always’ or ‘often’  felt rejected, compared with one in five overall.

Those with no good GCSEs were also more likely to have irregular mealtimes than those with more than five GCSEs at grades A* to C.

Martina Milburn, chief executive of the Prince’s Trust, said: ‘Without the right support, directionless teenagers can become lost young adults – unconfident, under-qualified and unemployed.’

Taking exercise may help to boost pupils’ performance in the classroom.

Scientists at the Vrije University Medical Centre in Amsterdam found a ‘significant positive relationship’ between physical activity and academic success in children and teenagers.

Exercise may help by increasing blood and oxygen flow to the brain, their analysis suggests.
