A kind-hearted couple splashed out over £9,000 to fly 17 rescue animals from New Mexico to their home in Scotland to save them from being put down.

Rebecca Knowles and her husband Vishnu brought the 15 dogs and two cats almost 5,000 miles across the Atlantic to their country home in the hills above Loch Ness.

Mrs Knowles said she just could not bear to abandon the animals after discovering them at farm where they were kept in cages and bred continuously.

The mental health counsellor said: 'I had a small rescue sanctuary which was mostly retired breeding dogs I rescued from a puppy mill that was closing down.

'The dogs were going to be euthanised so I rescued them.

'I had 40 dogs at one point, half were from the puppy mill and the rest were strays I’d rescued and pets my clients couldn’t look after any more.'

Last year Mrs Knowles, who is originally from Aberdeen, decided to move back home to Scotland with her husband after 17 years in America and tried to rehome the animals.

Some were successful and found new homes but many were returned to the sanctuary and the couple decided they had no choice but to take them.

Route: The animals were flown almost 5,000 miles from Chaparral in New Mexico to West Abercalder in Scotland

The dogs, which include poodles and a boxer as well as mixed breeds, and the two cats had a 24-hour journey including a flight from the animal sanctuary at Chaparral to their new home at West Abercalder.

Mrs Knowles, 51, said: 'It’s cost us around $15,000 - about £9,000. In my view animal lives are just as important as human lives.

'People were saying: ‘why don’t you put them in a shelter?’ but I had rescued them from a horrible situation where they had been in cages all their lives. It was worth the expense to keep them with me.

'They are doing really well and love the space we have here.'

The couple raised £70 through an 
online appeal to help with the cost of flights and said they would 
welcome further assistance, possibly from animal charities. They would also consider rehoming suitable animals to good homes.

Mrs Knowles added: 'I’m not going to do any more rescuing.

'I’d be interested in finding homes for them over here and anybody interested in providing one can get in touch.

'Out there [America] people have a very different view of animals and pet owning.

'It’s pretty much a third world country with stray dogs in the streets.

'I feel British people have a better concept of caring for animals.

'You rarely see dogs roaming the streets whereas in New Mexico it was normal to see strays with their bones sticking out.'
