Former X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos brokered a cocaine deal after she was drugged by an undercover reporter and then offered £3.5m to star in a Hollywood film, it was claimed today.

The singer, 26, is accused of setting up an £820 drug deal between the reporter, who she believed to be a 'big shot' film producer, and her friend Mike 'GLC' Coombs.

But today Southwark Crown Court heard that Sun on Sunday investigative reporter Mazher Mahmood spiked her drink, and was asked if he had touched her thigh 'on one or more occasion' to 'create a 
friendly and inviting' atmosphere during the recorded conversation.

'Fake Sheikh' Mr Mahmood, who used the name Samir Khan when setting up the singer, admitted using subterfuge but denied claims he spiked her drink as 'outrageous.'

Tulisa first met Mr Mahmood in Las Vegas last March.

He told her he wanted her to play the lead role in a 'Slumdog Millionaire' type film alongside someone like Leonardo Di Caprio, the court heard.

The pair met again two months later at the Metropolitan Hotel in London on May 10

Giving evidence from behind a screen Mr Mahmood was today asked whether he or his associate, known only as 'Nish' had spiked the singer's drink or offered her any money.

Jeremy Dein QC, defending, asked: 'At the Metropolitan Hotel, by the time Miss Contostavlos had left the Metropolitan Hotel had she been drinking.'

Mr Mahmood replied: 'Yes she had, but she was not drunk.'

Mr Dein continued: 'You and Nish spiked her drink didn't you?'

The witness firmly responded: 'That is absolutely outrageous.'

Mr Dein continued: 'You spiked her drinks to get her to incriminate herself.'

The reporter replied: 'That is complete and utter nonsense.'

Mr Dein also asked whether the journalist, posing as a Bollywood producer, had offered the singer millions of pounds to star in his bogus film.

He said: 'I make it clear that I suggest that Nish left her tape recording device, led Miss Contostavlos to the lavatory and offered her £3.5m before anything was said about cocaine.'

Mr Mahmood said he could not remember, but it was possible that money had been offered.

The journalist was also quizzed about tactics he employed to pull off the sting.

When asked if he knew the meaning of the word 'subterfuge' Mr Mahmood replied it was an approach employed by some journalists to 'elicit the truth'.

Reading the Oxford English Dictionary definition to him, Mr Dein said: 'Deceit used to achieve one's goal.'

'Would you agreed with that definition?'

Mr Mahmood replied: 'That would imply there is some malice involved. The purpose of this deceit is purely to establish the truth.'

When it was put to him that he had acted dishonestly, Mr Mahmood disagreed, saying that would be the same as suggesting undercover police officers acted dishonestly.

Mr Dein suggested that Mr Mahmood and Nish had only befriended Tulisa in a bid to get her to

incriminate herself.

The witness replied: '(It was to) establish whether or not she was involved in supplying cocaine to her friends.'

Mr Dein suggested: 'You manipulated her by making her believe that what she was saying to you was for the purposes of an audition, when in fact you were going to use it as evidence against her?'

Sitting in the glass encased dock, Tulisa smirked as the reporter replied: 'I disagree.'

Wearing a dusty pink dress cut just above be knee, a black blazer, black kitten heels and sporting a low ponytail and pale yellow manicured nails, Tulisa sat in the dock clutching a small image of religious idols.

Mr Dein asked Mr Mahmood whether his colleague Nish discussed a £3.5 million fee for the film role with Contostavlos.

Mr Mahmood replied: 'I can't remember but it's possible.'

He added: 'I remember she asked for £3 million for this film part through her accountant on May 23.'

The
 undercover reporter denied that his colleague Nish had spoken earlier 
to Contostavlos about the film deal in the toilets of Nobu restaurant, 
the popular celebrity hangout in London, without her recording device.

Mr Mahmood said: 'She's a celebrity. You don't have a conversation like that in a toilet in a restaurant like Nobu.'

He said he discussed 
Contostavlos's fee for the film with her PA Gareth Varey at the 
Metropolitan hotel on May 10 last year.

Mr
 Varey said the singer was expecting £2 million for the next series of X
 Factor after previously being paid £1.5 million and she would want £3 
million for the movie, the witness said.

Mr Dein said the film would tell the story of a female character from a 'ghetto background' and that Mr Mahmood had given the impression that he wanted a 'bad girl' for the part.

Mr Mahmood said: 'The part in the film was a bad girl. I didn't want a bad girl to play it.'

The jury was shown footage of the meeting in Las Vegas in which Contostavlos discussed the X Factor and told the undercover team she 'wanted to get away from that'.

Shortly afterwards, Nish - which is not her real name - pretended she was on the phone to Hollywood star Cameron Diaz, the court heard.

Mr Mahmood, who was accused by Mr Dein of 'lying to the jury' during parts of his evidence, denied that it was later suggested to Contostavlos that she may lose the part to Keira Knightley.

The court has heard that Contostavlos spoke about being able to get 'white sweets' and 'green sweets' - allegedly code for cocaine and cannabis - while at the Metropolitan Hotel with Mr Mahmood on May 10 last year.

The singer was also said to have bragged that she used to be part of a gang who sold crack cocaine and that her ex-boyfriend was a cocaine dealer.

Mr Dein said: 'The plan from the beginning was to get Ms Contostavlos very heavily under the influence of alcohol.'

Mr Mahmood replied: 'I had absolutely no intention of getting Ms Contostavlos drunk, nor was she drunk.'

Mr Dein asked the witness whether he touched the singer on the thigh 'on one or more occasion' to 'create a friendly and inviting' atmosphere during the recorded conversation.

Mr Mahmood replied: 'No, not true.'

He told the court that Mr Varey was 'visibly drunk' at the end of the night but denied that Contostavlos was in the same state.

Contostavlos started giggling in the dock and put her hand over her mouth as a video was played of the pair returning to Mr Mahmood's hotel suite shortly after 2am.

Tulisa, who is being tried under her real
 name Tula, denies one count being concerned in the supply of class A 
drugs between May 10 and May 23 last year.

The trial continues.
