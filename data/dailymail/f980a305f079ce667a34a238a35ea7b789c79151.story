A competition encouraging students to have casual sex for cash to find the 'horniest student' in Britain was today condemned as 'dangerous' by sexual health experts.

S*** At Uni has launched the UK's Horniest Student 2013 award and is offering the winner £500 cash, a Samsung Galaxy mobile phone, a crate of alcohol and a year's supply of condoms.

The website, which boasts 120,000 members, was launched last year by entrepreneur Tom Thurlow and advertises itself as helping students to have sex without 'the strings attached with dating'.

Prize: S*** At Uni has launched the UK's Horniest Student 2013 award and is offering the winner £500 cash, a Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini mobile phone, a crate of alcohol and a year's supply of condoms

But the competition has been slammed by sexual health experts and campaigners, who say it could lead to students catching and spreading sexually transmitted infections.

Sexual health consultant Dr Peter Greenhouse said: ‘The more people who try to win this award, the more dangerous things will be for their friends. It is far from a brilliant idea in public health terms.

‘If anyone is seriously trying to win this award then they desperately need to get a sexual health check-up and would be advised to get vaccinated against Hepatitis B and Human papillomavirus.

‘Most people who have sexual infections have no symptoms. They get these infections from people who don't know they have it. That is why there are so many infections around.’

Members of the website can enter the competition via its Facebook page by pledging what makes them the country's ‘horniest student’, along with their age and university.

Former MTV and E4 presenter Mr Thurlow, 23, of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, told MailOnline today: ‘From my point of view, students have sex with strangers all the time.

‘They go out clubbing and drinking and one night stands are definitely in student culture. Students can use the site to get more sex, they're over 18 and it's totally within their rights.

‘We do recommend that people write about 
safe sex and we promote safe sex. It’s amazing how the numbers keep 
growing. The feedback I always get is the members like the fact that 
it's discreet.'

Students have flooded the website's Facebook page with messages detailing their sexual activities and pledging why they are worthy of winning the 'prestigious title'.

The website says in a blurb for the competition: ‘We believe that student life is one of the most exciting times of your lives and you should live it to the fullest. One area of particular excitement is definitely the amount of sex you get to have.

‘We want to hear the funniest, the naughtiest or the weirdest sex stories you have.  If you tell us and we think your entry is the best, you will be the first to be awarded our prestigious title.’

Since launching the competition just over a week ago, hordes of students have left messages on Facebook and publicly revealed all about their sexual conquests.

'Leanne', 18, from the University Of 
Manchester, said: ‘Is this competition even real or is a joke? Because 
if it is real then I should win.

Warning: The competition has been slammed by sexual health experts, who say it could lead to students catching and spreading sexually transmitted infections

'Natalie', 18, at University of the West of England in Bristol, said: 
‘Slept with three third years during fresher’s week and been sleeping 
with two of them since. (But they don’t know, lol).’

The website will post a selection of 
its favourite entries throughout the competition onto the Facebook page 
and the most popular entry will be crowned the winner on November 1.

Rob, 18, Bath Spa University'Broke up with my bird before starting uni and its the best choice I've ever made. Our house has had at least two wenches round each night since uni began #bathplayas'

Gregg, 18, London South Bank University'I'm definitely the horniest student in the UK. I have only just started uni last week and I haven't managed to bag a s*** on any of the night outs. However! I've probably watched about ten hours' worth of porn and I'm devising a strategy of how to coax the fittie who lives in the building opposite to agree to sleep with me. I can't afford to get this wrong. I'm so horny...'

Beth, 18 Leeds Metropolitan University'Me and my housemates have a s*** leaderboard! Watch out to all the boys in Leeds, none of you are safe!'

Grant, 21, Herriot Watt University
'Easy ****** over ten girls since I got 
back. Tbf [to be fair] the girls are easy in Scotland. Desperate for it,
the lot of them'

'Leanne', 18, University Of Manchester‘All my girls joke that I’m the horniest as after a night out if I haven’t pulled I bang on my ex’s door in Salford until he lets me in for a quick b***. No shame, but a girl has needs, lol'

Mr Thurlow, who became well known 
after setting up a successful second-hand book business at 13, claimed 
last year that one of the biggest uptakes of members appeared to be 
women at Oxford University.

But
Natika Halil, from sexual health charity Family Planning Association 
UK, said: ‘New diagnoses of sexually transmitted infections have 
continued to rise and we know that young people remain at highest risk.

‘We
are particularly concerned that the high-profile campaigns which drove a
significant upsurge in the use of condoms, particularly in the 1980s, 
seem to have been forgotten and many young people will not have seen 
those messages.

‘The diagnosis figures suggest condom use is on the wane and many seem to be relying on treatment rather than prevention. Condoms are the only method of contraception that can help protect against STIs and unplanned pregnancy.’

Mr Thurlow was crowned Top Entrepreneur of the Year by The Mail On Sunday in 2006 aged 16 after becoming well-known by setting up a successful second-hand book business at 13.

He got the idea for the sex website from an MTV show he used to present called The Freshers, which saw him tour universities and ask students questions about life.

Mr Thurlow told MailOnline: ‘I left school with just my GCSEs and decided to try it out in the world of business. I worked my way up at MTV. I feel like I'm unbiased because I've observed how students act and I thought “there's definitely a business here”.

He said the website's success allowed him to leave his MTV job just two months after it launched, and is now his main income source. He had also previously worked for social network Bebo.

The entrepreneur added: ‘I think it's opened my eyes to how sex is definitely very readily available - and S***  At Uni proves that. I don't think it's changed me personally. But it makes me think this is definitely a new part of culture, this is what's available.’
