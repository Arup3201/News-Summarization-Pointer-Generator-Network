The alleged ringleader of the gang rape and murder of a student on a New Delhi bus was called 'mental' by friends and bullied the local community, Indian media have reported.

The body of bus driver Ram Singh was released to his family today, a day after he was found hanged in his cell at Tihar Jail.

Authorities say the 33-year-old hanged himself but his family and lawyer believe he may have been murdered.

The results of a post-mortem to determine whether Singh killed himself or was murdered are expected today

A new report said Ram Singh was a violent bully who intimidated his local community

The results of a post-mortem are expected back today and a magistrate is now investigating his death.

Singh's body was pictured being loaded onto an ambulance outside the All India Institute of Medical Sciences today, accompanied by his family.

It comes as a new report says Singh had 'no fear of the law' and forcibly married his wife Rekha, who died within a year of the couple adopting his brother's son.

According to The Times of India, locals remained silent about the marriage because of intimidation and Singh was known for his heavy drinking and fighting.

The newspaper quoted a 'police source' as saying: 'Throughout his interrogation, he showed no remorse, his voice remained frosty, emotionless as he narrated his gory deeds.

'It was so brutal that the policeman jotting down his interrogation report could barely write. His hands shivered.'

Singh was among the five men and a 
juvenile awaiting trial for the brutal attack on the 23-year-old trainee
physiotherapist in the Indian capital in December last year.

The assault triggered nationwide protests and an intense debate about rampant crime against women in India.

He was facing the death penalty if found guilty.

The Times of India said it has seen his confession in which he describes driving around to find a 'woman for sex'. He said he hit 'the boy' with a rod and then raped the student.

Authorities have called Singh's death a 'major lapse' in security at one of India's biggest prisons.

Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde, the nation's top law enforcement official, said 'It's a grave incident.'

Vimla
Mehra, the director general of the jail, declined to say how Singh 
killed himself without alerting the three other inmates in his cell or 
the guards.

Singh's father, Mangelal Singh, said
his son had been raped in prison by other inmates and had been 
repeatedly threatened by inmates and guards.

Mangelal Singh said he feared for the safety of another son who is also on 
trial in the rape case.

Kiran Bedi, the former director of the jail and now an activist, said prison officials had a moral and legal obligation to ensure Singh's safety.

'You are duty bound to protect the lives of the prisoners,' she said.

Mamta Sharma, chair of India's 
National Commission for Women, said jail authorities had to explain 
Singh's death 'despite so much protection, so much precaution, so much 
security.'

She said: 'This
means that even though he was accused of such a heinous crime, the jail
administration did not keep a watchful eye on him.'

In 2011, 68 inmates in India killed themselves and another eight were killed by fellow inmates, according to India's National Crime Records Bureau.

Currently 12,000 people are imprisoned at Tihar Jail - nearly twice as many as the facility was designed to hold.

Vivek Sharma, a lawyer representing another defendant, said he planned to ask the court to provide greater protection for his client.

'In a high-security jail, an occurrence of this kind is highly condemnable. It raises the serious issue of security of the accused persons in the jail,' he said.
