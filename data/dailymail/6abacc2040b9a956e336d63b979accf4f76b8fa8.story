A prosecutor in the Amanda Knox appeal who has been convicted of abuse of office today asked the court not to be 'believe in fairy tales' as he rebutted defence arguments in the case which is nearing its tense climax.

Giuliano Mignini, who bizarrely has been allowed to continue as a prosecutor despite his 16 month suspended sentence, added it was time the 'tragic case was dealt with serenity and rationality' - comments that had Knox's family and supporters raising their eyebrows.

They have questioned how he can be involved in the case after he was found guilty in early 2010 of exceeding his powers by tapping the phones of police officers and journalists investigating the still unsolved 'Monster of Florence' serial killings between 1968 and 1985.

Knox, 24, was convicted in 2009 of the brutal sex murder of student Meredith Kercher, 21, who was found semi naked and with her throat cut in her bedroom of the house they shared.

Initially Mr Mignini had insisted the murder was a Satantic ritual, then it was a botched burglary after a sex game had gone tragically wrong before finally deciding it was simply a 'motiveless killing and as such both accused deserve life'.

In the first trial Knox and her co accused, her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 27, were sentenced to 26 years and 25 years respectively but both have insisted they had nothing to do with the murder and are appealing their convictions.

Mr Mignini hit back at defence claims that Ivory Coast drifter Rudy Guede, who has already been found guilty of murder, was the sole culprit insisting that evidence showed all three knew each other well.

Mr Mignini told the court: 'Rudy 
Guede is the only person responsible for this murder they say - well we 
don't believe in fairy tales and you should not believe in fairy tales 
either.'These two little 
love birds have built up a pact of steel to defend themselves,' before 
adding that Sollecito at the beginning had told prosecutors he could not
remember if Knox had spent the night with him before changing his story
again and insisting they had been together.

Mr Mignini also highlighted how earlier in the week when graphic photographs of Meredith's lifeless body were shown in court Knox and Sollecito had looked away while the public gallery gasped in shock.

Guede (left) is the only person responsible for Meredith Kercher's murder (right) is a fairy tale

He said: 'Never, ever have the accused looked at the photographs of poor Meredith's body - I saw that poor girl with my own eyes.'But Amanda never looked at them once not now or even during the first trial, she kept her head down while Raffaele looked away to the other side of the room.'Mr Mignini also hit back at the defence claims that Knox had been 'crucified by the media' saying: 'I have never heard of an accused hiring a potent PR machine, offers of a million dollars and private jets at the ready to whisk her away overseas if she is cleared.'He was referring to suggestions in the Italian media that the three main American TV networks have put in astronomical bids to secure the first interview with Knox and are willing to fly her and her family back to the United States in a private jet.

Key to their original conviction was a 
30cm kitchen knife found in Sollecito's apartment and on which DNA from 
Meredith was said to be on the blade and that of Knox on the handle.However
a court ordered independent report has said that the DNA from Meredith 
was so low it should be deemed unsafe and could not even be retested - 
although they confirmed it was Knox's on the handle but her lawyers 
pointed out she had used it for cooking.

Judge Claudio Pratillo Hellmann is conducting the Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito appeal hearing. It is expected to end on Monday when the judge and his jury of five women and one man will retire to consider their verdict

The report also dismissed a clasp from Meredith's bloody bra and on which DNA from Sollecito was found - 46 days after it had been found and then lost by the forensic team with the report saying there was a high risk of contamination because it had been left so long.Meredith, from Coulsdon, Surrey, was in Perugia as part of her Leeds University and had only been in Italy for two months before she was brutally murdered and Knox and Sollecito were jailed in December 2009.Guede was handed a 30-year sentence for murder and sexual violence following a fast-track trial in October 2008 which was later cut to 16 years. The trial is expected to end on Monday when judge Claudio Pratillo Hellman and his jury of five women and one man will retire to consider their verdict.
