At the end of a week in which Garry Monk questioned Roy Hodgson’s continued absence from the Liberty Stadium, two Englishmen gave Swansea City their third win in three and another proved his sublime traits don’t always come saddled with the ridiculous.

For this was not just about West Brom’s numerous mistakes and three well-taken goals from Nathan Dyer and Wayne Routledge, the first of which came inside two minutes and the second was quite brilliant.

This was also about Jonjo Shelvey, so dynamic in his bursts from deep positions, but all too often a victim of his seemingly insatiable desire to over-complicate things.Last weekend, against Burnley, he followed a 50-yard pass with a simpler one straight into touch. Here, he got the balance right.

Brilliant, composed and faultless – on his game he is an attacking force that deserves higher consideration. 

If that caveat leaves too much room for doubt, Hodgson could at least justify the mileage by watching the two English wingers who tore West Brom apart. 

Leon Britton, the best of the lot, is injured for the next three weeks.

A modicum of perspective ought to be given to how poor West Brom played. Winless in three with two draws, this was often poor, occasionally inept. 

For each goal, they could have done so much better. 

The first can be chalked to bad luck, such was the calamity of timing that led Jonas Olsson to slip at precisely the wrong moment.

Wilfried Bony and Dyer had exchanged passes before the latter played in Gylfi Sigurdsson, who backheeled the ball ahead of Dyer. 

Olsson had a decent headstart and was shepherding the ball towards Ben Foster but then he slipped.

Dyer went through, rounded Foster and scored his second goal in successive Premier League games. Dyer is one of the players Monk is known to think should have drawn attention from England’s manager.

As is Routledge. His goal 22 minutes later owed more to technical brilliance than good fortune, but once more West Brom did little to help themselves. 

They were placed under far too much pressure by a careless pass from Chris Brunt, who was stationed in his own area and rolled the ball straight to Sigurdsson.

Sigurdsson’s cross was met by Craig Dawson but his weak header went straight to Routledge on the edge of the area. The ball bounced high but the execution of Routledge’s half volley was perfect, the goal stunning.

Enough mistakes? Evidently not.  

Bang: Wayne Routledge unleashes a vicious shot that finds its way towards the top-right corner of the goal and cements Swansea City's lead over West Brom

Incredible: Routledge's 24th-minute goal sailed past West Brom goalkeeper Foster and doubled the home side's advantage on Saturday afternoon

Unbelievable: Routledge turns in celebration alongside Wilfried Bony after scoring his brilliant half-volleyed strike to give Swansea a 2-0 lead

Congrats: Bony approaches Routledge after the 29-year-old scored a goal to remember against West Brom at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday afternoon

How it happened: Routledge's strike was full of technique and gave Swansea a 2-0 lead after just 24 minutes against a poor West Brom outfit

Olsson headed against his own crossbar after 31 minutes and it was a further nine before they had a meaningful chance, Saido Berahino shotting straight at Lukasz Fabianski. 

Even without the problems of a weak defence, the touches were sloppy, the attacks predictable. 

Had Routledge’s next half volley, arguably an even better strike than the first, gone into the top corner after 43 minutes, it would have been game over.

He looked annoyed to have missed but he need not have been. West Brom had nothing to offer. 

When Berahino shot in the 69th minute, it went out for a throw-in.

By then West Brom were lucky to have avoided a penalty when Andre Wisdom handled a shot from Bony on the line. It was only a temporary escape.

With 19 minutes still to play, Dyer put the boot in. Angel Rangel found Sigurdsson and he created his third of the afternoon with a perfect pass for Dyer. 

The winger went through, no marker close enough, and slid a low shot past Foster.

The M4 is a long road and Swansea sits near the end of it. It’s surely worth a trip for Hodgson at some point.

Excellent: Shelvey deserves higher consideration when playing in an attacking role as he did against West Brom, but will England manager Roy Hodgson take note?

Fiery: West Brom's Craig Gardner and Swansea's Gylfi Sigurdsson square up during the intense clash between the two Premier League sides

Strike:  Dyer bags his brace against West Brom in the home tie with a shot in the 71st minute to make it 3-0 to Swansea

Two: Dyer reminds the crowd how many he's scored during the well-earned victory for Swansea on Saturday as they emerge with three important points
