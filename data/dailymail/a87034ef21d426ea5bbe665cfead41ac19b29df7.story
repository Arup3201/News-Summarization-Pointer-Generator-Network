Don't blame yourself for overdoing it next time you pour yourself an excessively large wine – it could be all down to the glass you’re using and whether you’re holding it.

Researchers found drinkers unintentionally poured larger servings when their glasses were wider and when the pourers held them in their hands.

They also found drinkers were more likely to pour out less red than white because of its deep contrasting colour to glass.

Researchers found people poured larger glasses of wine if it is wide or if they are holding it at the time

After witnessing how environmental cues 
like plate size and food labels impact eating behaviors, researchers in 
the U.S. decided to take a look at how similar factors impact drinking 
experiences.

The team at Iowa State and Cornell Universities looked at 73 drinkers.

When glasses were wider, they poured 11.9 per cent more than what was considered a normal measure.

The students poured 12.2 per cent more 
when they were holding their glasses, compared with pouring into glasses
placed on a table.

And when they were drinking white wine in a clear glass, participants poured 9.2 per cent more than when the drink was red.

The report by Doug Walker, Laura Smarandescu, and Brian Wansink said: 'Now you know that 
you’re likely to overpour if you choose a wide glass, hold your glass 
while serving, or select a wine that matches your glass.

'But the good 
news is that, retrospectively, people seem to be aware of how these cues
influence their pours.'

It concluded: 'Being aware of the 
wine cues that impact pouring can help drinkers monitor their intake.

'However, knowing that you’ll pour more into a wide glass is different 
than knowing just how many ounces you’ll pour. When trying to monitor 
your alcohol consumption accurately, realise that you may be serving 
yourself 12 per cent more alcohol than you originally planned.

'When given the 
option, choose a narrower glass, place your glass on a table before 
pouring, and select a wine that does not match your glass to avoid 
unintentionally over-serving.'
