The Michigan woman who was sentenced to more than 10 years in prison this month after attempting to kill her 14-year-old autistic daughter in a botched murder-suicide, has spoke out from behind bars to detail the morning she planned to die.

Kelli Stapleton's murder-suicide plan was foiled when police rescued her and daughter Isabelle from carbon monoxide poisoning last year. 

The fact that Isabelle - called Issy - remained unconscious for four days after the incident, and Stapleton was easily resuscitated, has been used as evidence by members of her now ex-husband Matt's family that she only ever meant to kill her daughter. 

But Stapleton has maintained that her depression was real and that she was pushed to hopelessness the day she picked up her then 14-year-old daughter from a special treatment facility her insurance company had stopped paying for. For months, the mother of three had been writing a blog about the trials and tribulations of raising a daughter who physically abused her, and of whom she feared - even posting pictures of her wounds and videos of Issy's violent attacks.

While Issy had been doing well at the facility, Stapleton lost faith that she would ever be able to control her daughter when the teen hit her in the head upon arriving home that day.

After another beating two days later, Stapleton hatched a plan to kill her daughter and then commit suicide, believing it would make life easier for her husband and their two other children.

'We will be done with autism completely,' Stapleton wrote in present tense, in a letter to New York magazine from behind bars. 'She is going to be 100 per cent happy. She is going to be 100 per cent Isabel and I cannot wait to see that child.'

The evening of Labor Day 2013,  Stapleton started tying up loose ends with her family. She finished the laundry, told her son McKewan how proud she was of him and gave youngest daughter Ainsley a bracelet which read 'REMEMBER TO LOVE'.

Injuries: Before her attempt at murder-suicide, Stapleton wrote a blog about raising an autistic teen and shared these pictures of her injuries after violent episodes with her daughter 

The next morning, Stapleton woke up happy and eager to carry out her plan. 

'I am so excited because we are going to be in Heaven before noon,' she recalled. 'For the first time in my life I am going to be able to have a real conversation with her, and see her. Get to know her, without the perseverations and the aggression.'

First, she drove McKewan and Ainsley to school and texted Issy's caretakers that they had the day off.  Then she packed up the back of the van with a mattress, pillowcases from each of her kids' beds, a shirt from her husband and a hibachi grill.

Stapleton took her daughter to a wooded area near a hiking trail she had visited with a friend before, parked the car and got out the grill to make s'mores.

After letting Issy eat two of the treats, she gave her daughter a double dose of Risperdal, a drug that helps combat her aggression and makes her sleepy and tucked her into the van.

The mother then brought the still-smoldering grill into the van and closed all of the doors, hoping the trapped smoke would kill them both. 

Stapleton recalls the last moments before passing out, saying she and Issy talked about their pets and all of the items they would bring on a vacation to Florida.

She says they laid down on the mattress, nose to nose, and shared a final 'I love you' with each other.

But when police discovered the car that evening, they described the scene with a few notable differences in their reports. 

First of all, Issy was not laying down next to her mother but strapped in to the front seat, her throat 'raw as a hamburger', her mouth foaming and unresponsive. 

Meanwhile, Stapleton was found in the back seat, laying on the mattress stripped down to her underwear with a considerably lower body temperature and carbon monoxide poison intake than her daughter.

While Issy spent the next few days on a ventilator fighting for her life, Stapleton was easily revived and was already talking to paramedics responding on the scene.  

Stapleton was arrested and charged with  attempted murder - charges her attorney Heidi Hodek hoped to fight with an insanity plea. 

But Stapleton ruined those changes when she gave an interview with Dr Phil from behind bars, ruining their case that the attempted murder wasn't premeditated.

Two weeks before her murder case was set to go to trial, Stapleton conceded by taking a plea deal.

On September 9 she pleaded guilty to charges of felony child abuse. At her exceptionally long sentencing, friends defended her as a good mother who baked her kids cookies after school. 

From the other side of the court, her ex-husband's family spoke out to call her 'evil'.

Stapleton herself  let guilt get to her behind bars, letting her natural hair grow out and replace its usually black blonde and aging several years from the pretty football coach's wife she was before.

'I am not worthy to speak her name,' Stapleton said of her daughter at sentencing, asking the judge for 15 years in prison. 'She is not the monster. I am.'

Stapleton was sentenced to 10-22 years in prison.
