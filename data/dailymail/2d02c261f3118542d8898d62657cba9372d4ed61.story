The parents of a missing pre-med student at Northwestern University pleaded for help in finding their son, as the FBI joined efforts to locate the teen after he disappeared over the weekend.

Harsha Maddula, 18, was last seen early on Saturday after a night of partying at the school in Evanston, Illinois with a group of friends.

As search efforts intensify, Maddula's parents fear the worst and told reporters that their hopes are slowly fading that they will find the boy.

Police are still trying to work out 
the events that led to Maddula's disappearance but friends, who did not 
want to be identified, told The Daily Northwestern student newspaper that Maddula had 
been party hopping with friends on Friday night.

These friends said Maddula, who is a diabetic, did not appear to be inebriated, saying the teenager rarely drank because of his medical condition.

The partying began around 10:30pm on Friday, when Maddula left his dorm with eight friends.

The coterie of students arrived at an off-campus party around 11pm but after a half hour or so the group decided to move a house party nearby.

It was when the group arrived at the second party that they realized Maddula was no longer with them.

According to people familiar with the
events that night, a sophomore, Linzy Wager, spoke to Maddula around 
12:35am and he told her that he was back
at his dorm room - but police say surveillance video from his dorm and 
his electronic key access records show that he was not there.

His friends reported him missing at 6:35pm on Saturday, after they couldn't locate him.

Police have been reviewing his cell phone records, which did not yield any new leads.

Maddula's parents, Prasad and 
Dhanalakshmi, traveled from their home in Long Island to the Chicago suburb
to meet with school officials on Tuesday.

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, his parents fought through their emotions and urged anyone with information to come forward.

'Everybody is upset and sad that we cannot find him after almost three days now,' the father, Prasad, said.

'This is the fourth day and we want them to get him...this is my son. 
It's been four days. I don't know what happened to Harsha. My hopes are 
fading.'

Overcome with emotion, the boy's mother described her son as a quiet and thoughtful teen.

'He likes to study and he worked so hard to come here,' she said.

Friends and family described the college sophomore as a straight-A student with a big heart.

The school said they are committed to finding the boy, who is of Indian descent, 5 feet 8 inches tall, approximately 150 pounds, with black hair, dark brown eyes.

He was last seen wearing a grey long sleeve sweater with white and black stitching, dark grey pants and brown shoes.

Search efforts have been launched at the
campus and in downtown Evanston, 12 miles north of Chicago, organized 
by the South Asian Student Alliance, with which Harsha was involved. The
school is asking more students to assist in looking for the student.

Police had been handling the search since the teen was reported missing
on Saturday but now the FBI and the Evanston Police Department have 
been assigned to the case as well.

'This
is the start of our school year, so it's really a tough time for the 
family and a tough time for the university,' University spokesman Al 
Cubbage said on Tuesday.
