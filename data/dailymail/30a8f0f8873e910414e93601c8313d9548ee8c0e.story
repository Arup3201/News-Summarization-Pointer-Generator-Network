It should be a time when you cast aside your predictable workday attire and revel in the freedom to dress down.

But for David Cameron, going on holiday seems to bring out a determined desire to stay within his sartorial comfort zone.

At the beginning of his summer break yesterday, the Prime Minister clung resolutely to the identikit crumpled blue shirt, dark cotton trousers and smart black shoes that have accompanied him on family trips to Cornwall, Ibiza, Siena and now Majorca.

Family outing: Mr Cameron and his wife Samantha enjoy a coffee together today in Majorca, left, but Mr Cameron clearly needs more imagination with his wardrobe as he wore a very similar shirt just a year ago, top right, while having coffee in Tuscany

Meanwhile the Deputy Prime Minister ventured out in sandals that looked more suited to heavy-duty hiking 
than a relaxed stroll in Spain – though at least he remembered to take 
his socks off. 

David Cameron and his wife Samantha are in Majorca with their children and looked thrilled to have 
swapped Downing Street for a pretty pavement cafe in a quaint cobbled 
street area.

Perhaps heading
for a coffee at the beginning of their hols is a Cameron tradition, as 
last year in Tuscany they were spotted doing the same thing with the 
Prime Minister wearing almost exactly the same outfit.

Nick Clegg, with his wife Miriam, put on some rather heavy duty sandals for a gentle stroll in Spain

But hopefully this time the Prime 
Minister left a tip after last year in Italy he managed to fall out 
with a waitress after stopping for a drink with his wife.

Mr Cameron made headlines across
the world when it emerged he had paid for a 3.10 Euro bill with a 50 
Euro banknote and failed to leave any small change, as is customary in 
Italian bars.

Waitress Francesca Ariani, 27, failed to recognise the Number 10 
resident when he walked in with his wife Samantha, 40, and ordered two 
cappuccinos asking for them to be brought to an outside table.

The next day he returned to the bar and made amends with the waitress, by leaving a tip on that occasion.

Mr Cameron left Britain with his family yesterday, after the London Olympics came to a close on Sunday evening.

Their exact location on Majorca is currently being kept secret.

He is expected to return to the UK next week and spend a few days in the office before taking a further short holiday in the UK.

Questions were raised yesterday over 
Nick Clegg’s role in the Government after he flew away on holiday on the
same day as the Prime Minister, rather than taking charge of the 
country in his absence.

As 
both the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister began summer breaks in
Spain, William Hague was instead left to take the reins.

The holiday arrangements led MPs to 
question why the Lib Dem leader would jet off at the same time as Mr 
Cameron, with one Tory saying it was proof he was not really his deputy.

Foreign Secretary Mr Hague – whose 
full title is First Secretary of State – will  take charge of the 
day-to-day business of government in their absence until he goes away 
on his own foreign holiday next week.

Happy holidays: David Cameron and his wife Samantha stop for a quick coffee as they start their summer break in Majorca

Refreshment: Samantha tells her husband a story while his sips on his coffee

Don't forget to leave a tip! Last year in Italy the Prime Minister failed to leave any spare change and fell out with an angry member of staff

Action replay: The Camerons last year in Tuscany having a coffee at the start of their hols, with the Prime Minister clearly wearing the blue shirt he uses when he goes casual on a break

His wife might be an ambassador for the British Fashion Council, but even Samantha Cameron’s designer contact book can’t save husband David’s holiday wardrobe.

When you spend most of your time power dressing in a suit and tie dressing down in style can be tricky.

Yes, he IS a dad on holiday but that doesn’t mean he has to dress like man from M&S circa 1992.

Holiday dressing is a skill, and unfortunately for David taking off your tie and swapping a smart shirt for a ‘relaxed’ chambray style is not enough when vacationing in one of the world’s most stylish countries.

While Samantha channels her typical chic holiday vibe in a simple denim tunic dress and box fresh Birkenstocks,  David looks less than comfortable in the Spanish heat wave in freshly pressed jeans, slip-on shoes and navy denim-look shirt.

Next time he’s away from Downing Street Femail would recommend some tailored city shorts, a crisp white shirt and an espadrille for summer style points.

Home Secretary Theresa May, who flew 
back early from holiday last summer when the riots began, will then take
the helm for a few days before Mr Cameron returns.

Controversially, it emerged yesterday that this two-week break is not Mr Clegg’s first summer holiday this year.

The Deputy Prime Minister quietly slipped away during the Olympics to spend one week at the villa his family owns in France.

He has now flown to the small town of Olmedo in Spain.

He is due to spend two weeks in the 
area where his wife Miriam González Durantez grew up and her family 
still live.

They will be accompanied by their three children Antonio, 
Alberto and Miguel.

Tory MP Peter Bone has repeatedly 
asked both Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg in Parliament who would take over if 
the Prime Minister were to be unable to lead, but has never received a 
definitive answer.

Last night he told the Mail the holiday plans were proof that Mr Hague, not Mr Clegg, would actually take charge.

Speaking shortly before himself flying
to the US for a holiday, Mr Bone said: ‘What it clearly shows is that 
the real Deputy Prime Minister is William Hague and the Prime Minister 
has no intention of leaving Nick Clegg in charge, which is exceptionally
good news for the British people.

‘We can sleep safely in our beds and hope that he enjoys himself.

All in this together, almost: Both David Cameron and Nick Clegg depart from the UK for their annual holidays in Spain today, but the pair are off to different destinations

Taking it easy: Nick Clegg on holiday in Norfolk last year

Left in charge: The departure of David Cameron and Nick Clegg means the most senior minister remaining in the UK will be Foreign Secretary William Hague

‘I have never got a straight answer 
about the true pecking order but if Nick Clegg was a real Deputy Prime 
Minister there is no way he would  go on holiday at the same time as Mr 
Cameron.

‘The only reason they don’t say that Hague is number two is because it would offend Nick Clegg and the Lib Dems.

‘There is a serious point here. The 
country needs to know who is going to be in charge if the Prime Minister
is unable to lead.’

An irritated Mr Cameron defended his right to a break on Sunday.

‘I am a great believer that politicians are human beings and they need to have holidays,’ he said.

‘I don’t call it annual leave, I call it a holiday and I  am looking forward to having a holiday.’

No 10 officials insist that Mr Cameron remains in charge over his summer break.

He will be accompanied by a fully working office, security official and secure communications on his trip to the Mediterranean.

Downing Street said  he would be returning to  the UK next week and would be ‘back in the office for a couple of days’.

He will then head off for a ‘short 
break’ in Cornwall before returning to London in time for the start of 
the Paralympics on August 29.

Allies say Mr Clegg is in need of a 
break after a strained period in coalition relations following the 
abandonment of his plans for House of Lords reform.

A source close to the Lib Dem leader said: ‘It’s primarily so they can both get back for the Paralympics.

‘Last year there was a  phase where Nick was minding the shop.

‘He agrees with the Prime Minister 
that politicians do need holidays and the time available has been 
limited by events this summer.’

He did take charge of the Government 
for a few days last summer but Mr Cameron was forced to come home early 
from holiday as the conflict in Libya escalated.

A senior Lib Dem source added: ‘Perhaps Peter Bone should relax and have a holiday himself.’

‘I’m sure Mrs Bone would appreciate 
the quality time,’ the source added, in a reference to Mr Bone’s regular
mentions of his wife’s views when questioning members of the Cabinet in
Parliament.
