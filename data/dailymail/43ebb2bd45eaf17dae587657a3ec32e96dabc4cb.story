One of the many appealing things about Grigor Dimitrov is the complete lack of world weariness about him.

He looks ahead to Wednesday's lip-smacking quarter-final against Andy Murray with a disarming idealism that could only come from a youthful challenger and it can only whet the appetite further.

‘That’s the beauty of tennis, it’s basically a gladiator battle. It’s two people, one of them is going to come out and win,’ he said yesterday.

‘What a great way to do that kind of thing. A quarter-final match out on Centre Court, what more can you ask for?’

Best of frenemies: Grigor Dimitrov and Andy Murray share a good friendship off court

And what’s not to like about the life of Grigor Dimitrov? Owner of a supreme natural talent, champion at Queen’s 10 days ago, boyfriend of Maria Sharapova, an open personality and considered handsome — he is the Goldenballs of men’s tennis.

Whether he is quite ready to take down the defending champion is open to question but he is ready to give it a go. ‘I am here to bring my goodies!’ is how he put it.

One thing this will not be is a grudge match. The two camps are so close that, in the week before Wimbledon, a 200metre race was held between Dimitrov’s coach Roger Rasheed and Murray’s fitness trainer Jez Green.

Murray holds Rasheed in such high regard that he nearly hired him as his coach before the appointment of Ivan Lendl and it is easy to see why in the progress that the 23-year-old Bulgarian has made.

As a tennis player Dimitrov has gone from boy to man in 12 months and doubtless there has been some positive influence from Sharapova, the ultimate pro.

Dimitrov does not want to play up the Sharapova angle but acknowledges that some of her attitude has rubbed off. ‘There is no competition between us, not at all. We are at different stages. She has had an incredible career so far and has won a lot of incredible titles. I am just starting,’ he said.

‘I think  we can both learn things from each other. She is the best example of an athlete and player with her work ethic. Even before I knew her and all that, I thought she was the best.’

Had Rasheed been available now, Murray might well have called him again but in the event he has made the innovative choice of Amelie Mauresmo as coach, with every match now a sterner test than the last.

Mauresmo spoke on Tuesday for the first time in the tournament, as uncomfortable with the spotlight’s glare as Dimitrov appears to be relishing it. Yet she has enjoyed the work with Murray, who has played sublimely well so far this fortnight.    

‘We are getting to know each other much better and entering more the phase where we can tease each other, we can go a little bit more into details because I’m getting to know his game much better so it is developing the way it is supposed to,’ she said.

‘You aren’t going to change things or say everything you want because he has his own habits, his own way of doing things, and I don’t think it would be wise to all of a sudden come up with some very different thing. There is a difference for sure, a huge difference between men’s and women’s tennis. I noticed it, I lived it as a player. I see it around.’

While the intention has always been for this to be a long-term arrangement, she did not want to project into the future yet.

‘Now I am in the moment, it is good fun, it is going well. We will see if it goes further or not. Regardless if it does, it is a great experience.’

Same again please! Andy Murray has not dropped as set on the way to the defence of his Wimbledon title

This time last year Murray had come through serenely, only to nearly come unstuck against Spain’s Fernando Verdasco before coming back from two sets down. Dimitrov is so confident that he would surely punish such a slip-up Wednesday.

Like it was for the Spaniard, this is something of a free hit for Dimitrov.

He knows there will be lots of future opportunities, while Murray is aware that the time to win again is now.
