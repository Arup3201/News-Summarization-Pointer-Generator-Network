Tragic: Air Force veteran Ronald Westbrook was shot on Wednesday morning

The Georgia man who shot a 72-year-old who had Alzheimer's, after he wandered into his yard at 4am, could use the Stand Your Ground law if charged.

It is not yet clear if Joe Hendrix will be charged after shooting dead the Air Force veteran on Wednesday, but police said it was clear the 34-year-old felt threatened.

The sheriff's office said Mr Hendrix should have stayed in his house, but he broke no laws by confronting Ronald Westbrook, who he thought was an intruder.

Walker County Sheriff Steve Wilson told Fox News he believed Mr Hendrix did feel threatened and that the state's Stand Your Ground law may apply.

Under the law, a person is permitted to use force if they feel they are under physical threat. They do not have to retreat, even if backing down is a possibility.

Mr Westbrook, who was married and had three children, knocked on the door of the rented house Mr Hendrix and his fiancee had moved to only two weeks ago.

'He had traveled about 2.6 miles from his home to the shooting location by foot with a wind chill of about 20 degrees, very loosely clothed with his two dogs,' Sheriff Wilson told WRCB TV.

As Mr Hendrix called out commands Mr Westbrook, who talked slowly, continued to walk towards him, The Times Free Press reported.

When he failed to get a response, Mr Hendrix then fired his handgun four times, killing Mr Westbrook.

A post-mortem examination is due to take place in Atlanta, Georgia, tomorrow, and the circuit district attorney could bring charges after reviewing the evidence.

'Mr Hendrix is clearly saddened and 
heartbroken. Mr Hendrix has to live with his 
actions for the rest of his life,' Sheriff Wilson said.

He added: 'In my personal opinion, I believe that 
he should have stayed inside the house. Did he violate any 
laws by exiting the house? No.'

Mr Westbrook, who was wearing a straw hat and light jacket when he was shot, had been stopped by police a few hours before after being spotted standing at a mailbox close to where he used to live.

The Air Force veteran had told the deputy who stopped that he was just getting his mail.

Sheriff Wilson said that Mr Hendrix had been very cooperative with the investigation.

The Sheriff said he believed Mr Westbrook had approached that particular house because the porch light was on, according to the Chattanooga Times.

Sheriff Wilson told Chattanooga Times that he knew Mr Westbrook, who attended the same church as him.

‘Just a fine man, fine family,’ Sheriff Wilson said. ‘I really hate it for his wife and his children.’

Mr Westbrook's family hadn't realized that he had wandered off until around the time the shooting occurred.

‘You
 can't watch them 24/7,’ Sheriff Wilson said of people suffering from 
Alzheimer's disease, which he said got progressively worse for Mr Westbrook
 after dementia was diagnosed two years ago.
