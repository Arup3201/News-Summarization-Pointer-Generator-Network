Despite years of experience as a handler, Jason McDonald just wasn't quick enough to escape the powerful jaws of this eight foot gator.

This dramatic video shows the moment the gator wrestler was taught a painful lesson during a stunt for visitors.

It shows him struggling to free himself after a risky trick - involving him putting his hand in the creature's mouth - backfired and the gator clamped his teeth down and refused to let go.

Ouch! Experienced gator wrestler Jason McDonald had never been bitten before, until a risky trick backfired 

The 34-year-old's hand was trapped inside the alligator's mouth for more than 10 minutes. 

He was eventually released when friends and co-workers prised open the 150lb beast's mouth with a piece of metal.

Mr McDonald, who has been volunteering at Colorado Gator Farm in Mosca, Colorado, for 10 years, had never been bitten before.

He said: 'I've had many close calls before and I would still have my unbitten streak if I hadn't attempted that dangerous trick.

'I was in disbelief when it bit me and I was a little mad and disappointed in myself that I had allowed it to happen.

'But I've seen plenty of other people getting bit so I didn't panic at all.'

He added employees tried to help him by wedging the creature's mouth open with stick - but it only led to the gator clamping down harder. 

'I knew I had to control the head and keep the gator from rolling or shaking its head and causing me further injury,' he said.

'The bite started to hurt a little more as we tried to put sticks in its mouth to wedge it open - every time something touched the inside of its mouth it would clamp down harder.

'Once we were able to pry its mouth open and my hand was free it felt numb - I had one puncture wound that was about half an inch deep and was filled up with blood.'

Injuries: Mr McDonald had to have a cotton bud, dipped in bleach water, inserted into his wounded hand, left, and right, the injuries to his right hand after the ordeal

But he added that despite the ordeal, he will continue handling and treating alligators.

'At no point was I ever in shock. The worst part was when we used a cotton bud with bleach water to clean out the wound and prevent infection.

'I have no ill will towards the gator at all. I honestly have no idea why it closed its mouth and I plan on continuing to catch gators and teach my wrestling class - I just won't be doing that trick anymore.'

Mr McDonald, who treats and cares for the rescued animals, is a crematory manager - but in his spare time performs tricks for visitors to the farm.

He became involved with Colorado Gators when he signed up for a wrestling class. 

Colorado Gators started out as a fish farm, but in 1987, its owners decided to buy 100 baby gators, as a means of disposing of guts and carcasses.
