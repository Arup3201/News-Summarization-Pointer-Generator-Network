Nearly all the top executives at Sony Pictures Entertainment are white and male, apparently leaked documents say, raising questions about control of Hollywood's film output.

A spreadsheet said to show the salaries of 6,000 Sony Pictures employees, including top executives, reveals that of 17 earning $1million or more a year, just two are not white and just one is a woman.

The list was leaked to a reporter at news and pop culture site Fusion as the film studio reels from a wider hacking attack which also leaked five major new films.

An entrance gate to the Sony Pictures lot in Culver City, California: Fourteen of the 17 top executives at the major film studio are white and male, according to apparently leaked internal pay documents 

Minority of one: Co-Chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment Amy Pascal, the only woman earning more than $1million a year at the company, and chief executive officer of Sony Entertainment Michael Lynton

As corporate email and internal systems were knocked offline, Sony workers reportedly saw a message on their terminals saying 'Hacked by #GOP,' which is understood to be the initials of a group called Guardians of Peace.

Sony is said to be investigating whether North Korea was involved after the pariah state objected to the release of a comedy about a CIA plot to assassinate its leader Kim Jong-Un.

The latest leak from the hack is a spreadsheet titled 'Comp Roster by Supervisory Organization 2014-10-21', including detailed data about the salaries of Sony Pictures executives.

Kevin Roose, reporting for Fusion, who was sent a link to the data by an anonymous source, said: 'When I sorted the list by “annual rate,” I noticed something notable: a stark homogeneity among the people earning the most.

'Based on the spreadsheet ... the employees of Sony Pictures with the highest annual rates appear to be nearly entirely white men.'

Amy B. Pascal, co-chair of Sony Pictures Entertainment and chairman of SPE's Motion Picture Group, is the only woman among the top 17 most-highly paid executives.

She earns £3million a year, according to the spreadsheet, joint highest on the list, along with Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton.

Meanwhile, 15 of the 17 top executives appear to be Caucasian. The exceptions are Man Jit Singh, who appears to be South Asian, and Dwight R. Caines, who appears to be African American.

And representing the rest of the world... Man Jit Singh, left, worldwide president of Sony Pictures Entertainment, and Dwight Caines, its president of marketing, are the only non-white top-ranking executives

Sony Pictures is far from unique in having a largely white male leadership, however the spelling out of exactly how homogenous its top flight is will heap embarrassment onto the damage caused by the hack attack.

Copies of some unreleased Sony films such as Still Alice, Annie, Mr Turner, and To Write Love on Her Arms are now being distributed on file-sharing websites, as well as the still-in-cinemas 'Fury'.

A direct connection between the leak of those films and the hacking hasn't been confirmed, but it seems likely.

Culver City, California-based Sony Pictures said in a statement yesterday that it is continuing "to work through issues related to what was clearly a cyber attack last week.

'The company has restored a number of important services to ensure ongoing business continuity and is working closely with law enforcement officials to investigate the matter.'

Along with the FBI, Sony has brought in forensic experts from the Mandiant division of FireEye, a Silicon Valley cybersecurity company, according to a source familiar with the case who did not want to be named because the companies have not yet announced the arrangement.

Mandiant helps companies determine the extent of breaches and repair damages. The firm has worked on other high-profile computer breaches, including one at retailer Target last year.
