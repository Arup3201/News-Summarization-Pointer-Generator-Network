Stewart Parnell, of Peanut Corporation of America, was found guilty in Georgia federal court

The head of a peanut company that distributed salmonella-tainted peanuts that sickened hundreds of people across the U.S. five years ago has been convicted of conspiracy and other charges.

Former Peanut Corporation of America owner Stewart Parnell was found guilty Friday during a federal trial in Albany, Georgia.

Parnell, his brother, Michael Parnell, and quality assurance manager Mary Wilkerson have been on trial since August 1 on federal charges stemming from a salmonella outbreak in 2008 and 2009 that sickened 714 and was linked to nine deaths.

Michael Parnell was also found guilty of conspiracy.

The brothers are charged with knowingly shipping contaminated peanut butter to customers and faking lab tests intended to screen for salmonella. Tainted peanut butter from the company's plant in rural Blakely, Georgia, ended up in jars, packaged crackers and other snacks.

The outbreak led to one of the largest food recalls in U.S. history.

The peanut plant's quality control manager, Mary Wilkerson, is charged along with Stewart Parnell with obstructing justice. Experts say it is the first time food processors have been tried in a federal food-poisoning case.

There was testimony at the trial that people got sick. But attorneys and witnesses never mentioned any of the people who died because the Parnell brothers aren't charged with killing or sickening anybody.

Medical tests confirmed people who ate 
peanut butter from the Georgia plant were sickened by salmonella. It's 
harder to be sure salmonella killed some of them.

Instead, prosecutors decided they could build a stronger case charging them with defrauding their customers — food producers including Kellogg's — and selling them tainted goods, said U.S. Attorney Michael Moore of Georgia's Middle District, whose office tried the case.

'We wanted to make sure we kept the jury focused on the conduct that led to these people's sickness, but not let the case get into the medical history of every victim out there' with testimony on individual deaths, Moore said.

Defense attorneys have acknowledged the Georgia plant shipped tainted peanut butter and covered up positive salmonella tests, but they say the scheme was carried out behind the backs of the Parnell brothers by two plant managers who pleaded guilty.

The three defendants, charged with 71 total counts, still face severe punishment if convicted.

Prosecutors have said Stewart Parnell faces a maximum of 754 years in prison and $17 million in fines. And Moore said he intends to present evidence of the deaths during sentencing if there are convictions.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which tracked the outbreak from victims back to the plant, determined 714 people got sick in 43 U.S. states.

Three deaths were reported in Minnesota, two in Ohio, two in Virginia, one in Idaho and one in North Carolina. But the CDC hedged when tying fatalities to salmonella.

'The nine deaths reported are linked to the Salmonella Typhimurium outbreak, but were not definitively caused by Salmonella,' the CDC said in a May 2009 report.

Marler said all nine who died tended to be older people with other problems that made them vulnerable to severe effects from food poisoning.

'They have cancer, they have diabetes, they have heart disease and their immune systems are compromised,' Marler said. 'There's no question they were infected. It's really about what prompted their deaths.'
