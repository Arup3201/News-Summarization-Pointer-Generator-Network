A teenage girl helped her big sister to give birth at a  rest spot on the I-95  when the baby decided that she couldn't wait for them to get to the hospital.

Kennedy Smith, 14, and her sister Kelsea Marcus, 21, were being driven to Christiana Hospital in Newark by their mom on Sunday.

But they soon realized that the baby was not going to wait until they got to the hospital as they drove down the busy road near Delaware.

‘Everyone was going crazy, so someone had to stay calm and keep everything together,’ Kennedy told Fox 29. 

Kennedy said she was sitting in the back seat of the car supporting Marcus who was sitting in the front seat and calming their mother down as she drove them at top speed to the hospital. 

As Smith entered the northbound I-95 from Del. 896, Marcus told her that she was trying not to push, 'but had to.' 

Kennedy said: ‘Ten minutes after my sister's water broke, the baby came.’

Kennedy called 911 and her mother pulled over into the Delaware Welcome Center on I-95. 

By that time, the baby was fully delivered with Kennedy's help.

The 911 operators instructed Kennedy how to tie off the baby's umbilical cord and wipe the baby's mouth area. 

Safe hands: Kennedy Smith, 14, is an honor student and helped to deliver the baby, she has plans to enter the medical field and will study  at the University of Pennsylvania next summer

They also instructed her to go six inches down and tie off the umbilical cord.

She said that if she hadn't been wearing shoelaces she was prepared to use the string from her hooded sweatshirt instead. 

The beautiful baby girl was born weighing a healthy seven pounds, one ounce. 

She was welcomed into the world with kisses and cuddles from her aunt, mom, and great- grandmother. 

Soon, New Castle paramedics arrived on the scene and assessed both the baby and her mother. They were then transported to the hospital.

The baby had been due on September 20 but was not born.

Marcus was scheduled to be induced at 9 p.m. on Sunday. But the baby clearly had other plans.

Meanwhile, Kennedy, an honor student, says she plans to become a doctor. 

This summer, she studied at Southern Methodist University in Dallas and is scheduled to study next summer at the University of Pennsylvania. 

She told Fox 29: 'I'm in a STEM program so I'm training to be a physician. And this gives me more experience I guess so I think I'd actually consider going into medical field and delivering babies.'

Her proud mother added: ‘We don't know what we would have done if Kennedy wasn't in the car keeping us calm. It was scary.’
