The woman who is known for giving Katie Price her literary success has died at the age of 49.

Author Rebecca Farnworth aided the model and businesswoman into a career as an 'author' by ghostwriting her novels and autobiographies. 

The mother of three wrote 14 books under Price's name over the past decade (nine novels and five autobiographies), with the first - Being Jordan - selling in excess of a million copies.

Rebecca Farnworth died on November 24 after battling cancer. She was the author behind 14 of Katie Price's successful novels

Katie's second ghostwritten novel, Crystal, sold 160,000 copies in the first three months and stormed straight to the top of the hardback best-sellers list.

Rebecca's literary agent Maggie Hanbury, announced on Monday that the mother and author had died last week following a battle with cancer.

Reports stated that she died on November 24, surrounded by friends and family. 

Rebecca had first teamed up with the model and businesswoman after forging a career as a radio producer and print journalist.

Prolific writer: Rebecca ghostwrote 14 of Katie Price's titles including five autobiographies and nine novels

Katie, who has yet to publicly comment on Rebecca's death, made no secret of the fact her books where ghostwritten and often praised Rebecca for her writing talent. 

She said on BBC Radio 4 in 2012: 'I feel sorry for Rebecca. She's been with me about 10 or 11 years. I speak in the dictaphone.'

She added: 'You've definitely got to have a talent to sit there and write the book. I mean she's amazing at it.

'So, I come up with the plot, and then we go through each chapter together. She fills out the bits. She's just amazing how she does it. She really is good.' 

In an interview with beachhutwriters.co.uk in 2013, Rebecca had said getting the deal to ghostwrite Kate's books had been a 'life-changing moment'.

She said: 'The turning point in my career as a writer came when I was interviewed by the literary agent, Maggie Hanbury, who was looking for a ghostwriter for Katie Price’s autobiography. 

'It was one of those life-changing moments, though I didn't know it at the time.'

In another interview with novelicious.com in 2013 she revealed how she never expected to go from being a radio producer and magazine and newspaper writer to the voice of a tabloid celebrity.

She explained: 'I hadn't set out to be a ghostwriter, in fact before I landed the job of ghost writing this particular celebrity autobiography, I would have been hard pressed to say what a ghost actually did!'    

Katie often praised Rebecca's writing talent and made no secret of the fact she hadn't penned her novels and memoirs herself

Despite being most famous for her work with Katie, the Brighton-based writer had also published several works of fiction in her own right, beginning in 2009 with Valentine, followed by two other books A Funny Thing About Love and Swimming Pool Summer. 

Maggie Hanbury described Rebecca as 'talented' adding that the fact that everyone knew of her work with Katie made her well-known and respected.

'Rebecca Farnworth had a rare talent. She wrote three romantic novels under her own name but perhaps ironically achieved greater fame - because it was an open secret - ghostwriting Katie Price's books.'

She said the first volume of Price's memoirs - written when she used the name Jordan - had been a hit, 'much to the amazement of the publishing industry'.

Maggie added that Rebecca's work on the autobiography blazed a trail for a whole new breed of celebrity writing. 

'The book broke a mould,creating a new genre that went on to spawn countless other celebrity memoirs. 

'At every turn, Rebecca was totally professional, with a journalist's ability to get to the heart of the matter, always delivering on time a near-faultless manuscript.'

More than a ghostwriter: Rebecca also wrote a number of novels in her own name after establishing a career as a journalist and radio producer

Maggie ending by saying that Rebecca was not only a huge success professionally but also a pleasure to work with. 

'Vibrant and full of life, Rebecca was huge fun to work with, always ready with a quip to set the room alight with laughter. She created memorable authentic characters that seemed to have a life of their own.'

'Her natural empathy, humour and zest for life shone through in her work.'
