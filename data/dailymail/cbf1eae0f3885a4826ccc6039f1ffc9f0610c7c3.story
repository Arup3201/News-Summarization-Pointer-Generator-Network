A P.E. teacher who was jailed for running a brothel has been banned from teaching but may be able return to the classroom in as little as three years.

Tim Blake-Powell, 51, pimped out six women - including his ex-wife - and also worked as a prostitute himself from a flat in the well-heeled cathedral city of Canterbury, Kent.

He had moonlighted as a pimp while working as a teacher at the King Ethelbert School in Birchington, near Margate, Kent, between 2004 and 2007.

Blake-Powell was jailed for nine months in 2009, after admitting a charge of controlling prostitutes for financial gain.

In a decision announced today, Secretary of State for Education Michael Gove issued a Prohibition Order removing Tim Blake-Bowell from the teaching register.

However, he accepted a recommendation from schools disciplinary body the Teaching Agency that Blake-Bowell - who also uses the name Tim Smith- can apply to be restored to the Register in three years.

In a decision issued on the Secretary of State’s behalf, Teaching Agency deputy director Alan Meyrick said: 'I have given this decision and the recommendations it contains very careful consideration.

'Mr Blake-Bowell has been convicted of a serious criminal offence. His behaviour therefore clearly brings the teaching profession into disrepute.

He has failed to uphold the high standards required of the profession. The public need to have confidence in the standards of the teaching profession.

'I support the recommendation that Mr Blake-Bowell be prohibited from teaching.

'This seems to me to be a proportionate response to a serious conviction that led to the courts imposing both a custodial sentence and a confiscation order.'

Turning to the period after which the decision can be reviewed, he continued: 'I support the recommendation that Mr Blake-Bowell be permitted to apply for restoration of his eligibility to teach after a three year period.

'This takes into account the seriousness of the offence, but also recognises the steps that Mr Blake-Bowell has taken towards rehabilitation.'

The decision means that Mr Blake-Bowell is prohibited from teaching and cannot teach in any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or children’s home in England.

He may apply for the Prohibition Order to be set aside, but not until 2015.

If he does so, a panel will meet to consider whether the Prohibition Order should be set aside.

He has a right of appeal to the Queen’s Bench Division of the High Court within 28 days.
