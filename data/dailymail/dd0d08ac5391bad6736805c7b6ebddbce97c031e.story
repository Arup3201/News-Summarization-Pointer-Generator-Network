QPR are in talks over a deal for Galway teenager Ryan Manning. 

The Republic of Ireland U19 international has also held talks with Tottenham after they agreed a fee with his club but Manning is expected to sign for the Loftus Road club. 

Manning, 18, can play in midfield or as a forward and is capped at youth level for Ireland.

QPR are in talks over a deal for Galway teenager Ryan Manning, but Tottenham are also interested in him

The Under 19 international, who has scored once in three games at that level, only joined Galway at the beginning of 2014.

Prior to that, Manning was playing for Mervue United in the League of Ireland First Division.

QPR boss Harry Redknapp previously mentioned that the suspension of striker Charlie Austin highlighted the club's need for more forwards.

But supporters may have been hoping for somebody slightly more established than Manning.
