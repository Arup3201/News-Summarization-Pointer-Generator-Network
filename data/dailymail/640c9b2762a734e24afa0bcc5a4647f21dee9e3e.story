Police have charged a man over a three-hour London siege which closed one of the country's busiest shopping streets.

Michael Green, 48, of Stevenage, Hertfordshire, is accused of storming into an office in Tottenham Court Road and allegedly making threats and carrying a weapon.

He has been charged with several offences including  possession of a weapon for the discharge
of a noxious liquid/gas or electrical incapacitating device; false 
imprisonment; making a bomb hoax; causing criminal damage and recklessly
endangering life.

He has been remanded in custody to appear at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court on Monday morning.

Detective Chief Inspector Raffaele D'Orsi, of Camden police, said: 'Yesterday's events were extremely rare and I would like to thank the general public and local business community for the support they provided to my officers in dealing with these matters so expeditiously.

'Finally I can confirm it is all back to business as usual in Tottenham Court Road and the surrounding area.'

Officers, including marksmen, explosives experts and police negotiators, rushed to the scene shortly after noon on Friday.

They ordered the evacuation of at least 1,000 office workers and many more shoppers and tourists in the area.

Heavily-armed members of Scotland 
Yard's firearms unit CO19, kitted out with Glocks, Tasers, stun grenades
and spare ammunition, deployed around the cordon as the incident unfolded.

A special forces unit based in 
central London was also put on stand-by while the Army’s bomb disposal unit 
was sent towards the scene. The RAF’s nuclear biological and chemical 
warfare group became involved because of the fear posed by the gas 
canister.

The officers perform hugely sensitive
tasks and the protection of their identity for undercover work was 
ensured by the use of a balaclava.

Bystanders were pushed 
back to Euston Road, which is about half a mile from the scene.

Snipers were also seen on nearby rooftops.

A KFC worker, Arti Pal, 23, said: 'It
all kicked off at about 12.30. Police came in and told customers they 
could no longer order food and that they had to get out.

'About 15 minutes later the came back and told us to get out as soon as possible. All our stuff is still in there.'

The area around Tottenham Court Road has been almost completely cleared by police

A police cordon was in place from Store Street to the south of the incident.

Dozens of onlookers watched and took photographs with their mobile phones.

Five marked police cars and vans could be seen lining Tottenham Court Road, as well as four ambulances.

Unmarked police vehicles also drove up to the scene and three London buses were stopped in the road with their amber lights flashing.

A police negotiator was seen speaking to the officers guarding the cordon, and he was given directions to the scene.
