Help? Residents indicated they will call on their former neighbours, Kate and Wills, to fight fracking

No sooner do I reveal that Prince William is pining for a quiet refuge for his family on Anglesey than I discover he is in danger of being dragged into a row there over mineral and mining rights — and possibly fracking.

It follows letters sent to 4,000 residents over manorial rights to the island, which were bought by a former policeman more than 20 years ago.

Stephen Hayes, 67, bought rights covering 10,350 acres of Anglesey where William enjoyed his first two years of married life with Kate while working as a search and rescue helicopter pilot.

But now the Land Registry has written to homeowners there, alerting them to the registration of the manorial title which, apparently, gives its owner interest in mineral and mining concerns.

Since this has never happened before, locals are worried, not least because they fear these might involve fracking.

One says: ‘It may be that William can help us in this.’

Only last week there was a ‘peasants’ revolt’ after the Marquess of Salisbury, the former Tory leader in the House of Lords, sent a letter to homeowners in Welwyn Garden City claiming his rights in respect of ‘mines and minerals’ beneath their homes.

In Wales, politicians have asked First Minister Carwyn Jones to end these ancient rights, which are often bought by wealthy eccentrics to give themselves a  decorative lord of the manor title.

The title for the Manor of Treffos in Anglesey was bought in 1992.

‘I was at a property auction in Manchester and by chance the title came up,’ says Hayes, who theoretically could call himself Lord Treffos.

‘I bought it with no research purely for a commercial reason, which fell through.

Neighbourly: The couple had a strong relationship with the community. Here Kate is pictured accepting gifts

‘I regarded it as worthless until the Government, in recognising mineral values as a result of fracking, appear to have decided to put all the manorial titles in order and insisted they be registered.’

He says he is £40,000 out of pocket ‘for something I bought on chance’.

Hayes adds: ‘I have spoken to some locals and told them I am happy to sell back the title to residents, some of whom are elderly and very distressed.

‘I would do this at a nominal figure if they joined together.’
