Life-saving drugs could be available years earlier  under Government plans to overhaul ‘broken’ NHS rules.

The time it takes for breakthrough drugs to be tested and cleared for use could be halved, ministers believe.

Life sciences minister George Freeman said patients must 'get access to new life-saving drugs years faster than they do now. Not one or two years, but six or seven'. He promised that this would save hundreds of lives a year. 

New life-saving drugs can take up to 10 years to get tested and signed off for use on the NHS

The Department of Health said a fresh approach was being made possible by ground-breaking developments in medicine and digital technology.

Officials said the review would examine how precision medicine and digital health technology could enable new products to be brought from the laboratory ‘as quickly and safely possible’.

‘This will transform the landscape of drug development,’ Mr Freeman told The Times.

He added: ‘For too long NHS patients have seen drugs and innovations developed in the UK but not adopted here in our NHS.

‘We are determined to unlock the power of our NHS to be a test-bed for the 21st-century medical innovations we all need, getting NHS patients faster access, reducing the cost of drug development and boosting our life science sector.’

Among the issues the review will consider is how a more ‘collaborative’ approach between the pharmaceutical companies and the regulatory and evaluation bodies can can be developed to ensure innovative products are assessed more quickly.

It will also look at whether charities and patient groups could play a greater role and what more could be done to promote the rapid adoption of important medical innovations into clinical practice.

Lisa Brydon was given 12 months to live by doctors when she was diagnosed with brain tumours

A terminally-ill woman has slammed the NHS claiming they refuse to pay for her life-prolonging drug - but will still fund cosmetic surgery.

Lisa Brydon, who was given 12 months to live by doctors when she was diagnosed with aggressive brain tumours, said it was unfair that the NHS is still funding non-emergency treatment rather than other ‘life and death situations’.

An application from her specialist has three times been rejected, with a final appeal now pending - despite scans showing the drug has shrunk her tumours and significantly reduced her dependence on steroids, both improving her condition and saving the NHS money.

Aggrieved Lisa, 43, has already paid £21,000 since July for the drug Avastin but she and her husband are rapidly running out of cash and are warning they face selling their house to fund it.

Avastin has been previously given to several dozen brain tumour patients in Yorkshire by the Government’s Cancer Drugs Fund but funding was axed following the NHS re-organisation last year.

Former triathlete Lisa said: ‘I feel aggrieved that I’ve paid for my own mini-trial to see if this drug will work. I’ve shown it has worked and is working and nobody is listening to us.

‘The NHS is still funding non-emergency treatment such as cosmetic surgery, compared with my case and others which are life and death situations - it seems unfair.’
