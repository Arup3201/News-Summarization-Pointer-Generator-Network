 On June 4, an unsupported four-story wall crashed down onto a Philadelphia Salvation army, trapping workers and shoppers for 13 hours and killing six people.

Despite an architect's warnings that the wall might collapse the night before, demolition contractor Griffin T. Campbell decided not to brace the wall in order to cut costs. He ended up cutting limbs.

Mariya Plekan was one of those victims, and remembers being trapped in the store for 13 hours. She took the bus to Center City in Philadelphia hoping to find shopping deals, but found disaster instead. Her story was made public for the first time yesterday by her lawyers who are helping her to sue responsible parties. 

Mariya Plekan, who lost her legs after being pulled from the Salvation Army rubble, told her story for the first time yesterday

Now the twice Widowed Ukrainian woman will be in a wheelchair for the rest of her life after losing her legs to amputation after her bloodied body was pulled from the rubble by a rescue team.

'They started to move things around, then I had a hope, I had a hope that they will save me shortly. But it didn't happen,' she said. 'I was screaming, 'Help, help.' But nobody heard me. And I remember everything.'

Philly.com reports that Common Pleas Judge Mark Bernstein put a stop on civil cases so that the criminal investigation could unfold, but he made an exception for Plekan due to her serious medical condition.

She was caught beneath the rubble for 13 hours before a rescue dog heard her cries for help

Her Lawyer Andy Stern of the Kline & Specter firm was there with her on Wednesday night as she spoke through a translator. Stern said her medical bills are already millions of dollars and will continue to rise.

'I was looking through the clothes and all of a sudden I heard the noise,' said Plekan, 52.

'And the only thing that I had a chance to say is, 'Why?' and the roof collapsed. . . . And my limbs, my legs were pinned down,' she continued.

Plekan said she was stuck under the rubble but that she could see a tiny light and was able to hear distant voices of the rescue team above her. She cried for help but no one heard her at first.

Finally, a search dog heard her cries and led a firefighter towards her.

'The
dog followed my yell...And they started pulling things apart and they 
pulled me out. And I didn't realize that it was night because the 
spotlights were on. I was so happy that I was saved,' she said.

The collapse could have been prevented if the 40 foot free standing wall had been secured the night before

She was a healthy mother of two and grandmother before she was brutally injured during the building collapse

'My children and my granddaughter - because of them, I want to live, I want to live,' she said. 'But it's so hard.

'Pain, pain, pain, and that pain is still going on . . . the pain of my flesh, but as well of my soul,' she lamented.

'I have a normal memory and I have a normal understanding of how I am living right now. And every day I understand how hard it is to be without legs. When you cannot take care of yourself when you constantly depend on other people to take care of you, and I do not know how to live after that because it's so hard for me,'she told lawyers.

Griffin T. Campbell and his team of 
demolition workers never warned the Salvation Army of possible dangers. 
Had the building been deemed unsafe, Plekan said she would not have 
entered.

A lawyer for 
the Salvation Army, Eric Weiss, told Philly.com that the building's 
owner Richard Basciano is also to blame for the collapse.

'They never gave the Salvation Army a chance and they never told the Salvation Army that they had a change in plans,' he said.

Griffin T. Campbell has been charged with murder, manslaughter and reckless endangerment after choosing 'greed' over safety

There was a huge communication issue between Basciano's company, STB investments, and the Salvation Army. Salvation Army reps were communicating with STB  out of New York and couldn't see STB's unsafe methods. Lawyers are ensuring that those responsible for the tragedy are persecuted.

Griffin T Campbell, The contractor who oversaw a botched building demolition that killed six people in a Salvation Army thrift store in Philadelphia has been charged with murder, manslaughter and reckless endangerment after choosing 'greed' over safety.

Griffin T. Campbell was also charged with risking a catastrophe and criminal conspiracy in addition to the six counts of third-degree murder, six counts of involuntary manslaughter and 13 counts of endangerment.

Campbell alone chose the demolition method, cutting corners to meet a deadline and cut costs, as he was being paid a flat fee, Williams said.

He was also given the right to salvage floor joints and other material, so he pulled the valuable floor joists out first, destabilizing the exterior walls, Williams said.There was also no scaffolding in place to remove an unsupported 40-foot brick wall, which tumbled onto the one-story thrift store, burying the six dead and 13 survivors.

Basciano's architect, Plato Marinakos, who had secured the demolition permit, testified before the grand jury after he was promised immunity.

Basciano, once dubbed the pornography king of New York's Times Square, owned the three run-down storefronts being razed.

Several lawsuits have been filed against Basciano, a commercial developer hoping to redevelop the block, along with Campbell, Benschop and others.

The victims' lawyers also accuse the city of lax oversight of the demolition process, but the city is generally immune from such lawsuits.

One of the victims was the 24-year-old daughter of the city treasurer.

Building owner Richard Basciano was not charged with any crimes Monday, and Williams declined to comment on his fate.

However, the grand jury will continue to hear evidence in the case.
