A woman 
decapitated her neighbour as she pleaded for her life after an argument 
over unpaid rent before scattering her body parts across two counties, it has been claimed.

Leah
 Cuevas, 42, from Brooklyn, allegedly murdered mother-of-four Chinelle LaToya 
Thompson Browne before dismembering her body and dumping the parts 
around Long Island.

Neigbours
 living in the same Brownsville apartment block reportedly heard 
blood-curdling screams as Cuevas hacked off Mrs Browne’s head with 'a 
sharp instrument'.

Prosecutors said that on July 5, Browne was seen 
entering Cuevas's apartment. Shortly thereafter, the witness reported 
hearing Browne scream, 'Oh no, oh no. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.'

Moments 
later the witness said she heard Cuevas yell an expletive telling Browne
 to 'shut up'.

The Guyenese immigrant's dismembered torso was discovered in a wooded lot near the Fire Island 
ferry terminal in Bay Shore on July 9, Biancavilla said. Her severed 
legs were found nearby.

Days
 later, the woman's arms were found in separate yards in Hempstead, 
about 25 miles west of Bay Shore, and her severed head was discovered at
 another home in the village on July 17, the prosecutor said.

Prosecutors believe Cuevas had pretended to be the landlord' following the death of the building’s owner last year.

She is said to have collected rent from tenants despite the fact the building’s lacked hot water and electricity was scarce. It is believed Browne had become fed up with the and refused to continue paying.

Cuevas, 42, has not been charged with defrauding tenants.

She was held without bail in Suffolk County District Court on Long 
Island after pleading not guilty to second-degree murder.

A
 statement a neighbor in the building gave to police said the two women 
had argued loudly the day before over complaints about no electricity, 
hot water and unpaid rent. That neighbor said Browne was renting a room 
from Cuevas.

Mary
 Beth Abbate, a court-appointed defense attorney, argued during the 
arraignment that Suffolk County was not the proper venue because the 
killing allegedly took place in New York City. Assistant District 
Attorney Robert Biancavilla said that because the victim's torso was the
 first evidence recovered — and that happened in Suffolk County — the 
local court was the proper venue.

District Court Judge G. Ann Spelman agreed and allowed the arraignment to proceed.

An
 autopsy determined that Browne died of 'homicidal violence,' including 
multiple stabbing and incise wounds, Biancavilla said. He added Browne's
 blood was found in Cuevas's apartment and in a hallway.

Scene: The Hempstead police said the head was found around 5 pm Thursday on Boylston Street, close to where the two arms were found dumped earlier this month

He
 did not say whether a murder weapon was recovered, but police noted in a
 press release announcing the arrest that the investigation remained 'active'.

Dale
 Browne, the victim's husband, said his wife had moved to New York about
 a year ago and worked in a Manhattan department store. He planned to 
move to New York with their four children after he got his paperwork 
completed.

He read from a Bible verse outside the courtroom following the arraignment before speaking with reporters.

'I trust God,'
 he said. 'My wife was a human being, a mother of four, a wife and all 
that goes with that connotation. She loved her family; she made a 
sacrifice to leave Guyana to come here.'

He
 added: 'What hurt the most is when the prosecutor described the words 
that she screamed out. I can hear those words, you know? Pretty 
animalistic. Just a beast that did this.'

He declined to comment on whether Browne had spoken of prior disputes with Cuevas.
