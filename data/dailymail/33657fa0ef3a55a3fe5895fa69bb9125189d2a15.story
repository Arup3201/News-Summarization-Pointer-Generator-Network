James Close was head of a violent group of gangsters who laundered large amounts of cash and were involved in drug dealing 

A cafe owner who called himself 'Mr Santa' because he gave out free Christmas dinners to the homeless has been jailed for almost 14 years after he was exposed as a ringleader of a criminal gang.

James Close, 31, posed as a charitable community man when he was in fact head of a violent group of gangsters who laundered large amounts of cash and were involved in drug dealing.

In total, 21 of the gang were jailed following an investigation by the North West Regional Crime Unit that seized £1.2million, heroin and cocaine worth more than £200,000 and a sawn-off shotgun.

Close courted publicity for his apparent generosity and served up Christmas dinners for the homeless. 

In 2009, he gave out 50 free Christmas dinners from his cafe and in 2010 prepared 150.  

He said: 'Everyone deserves something to eat on Christmas Day, whether you have millions or nothing.

'I'm hoping we can bring some Christmas joy to the homeless as well as elderly people and deprive families.'  

But he has been unmasked as the 'patriarch' of a criminal gang that would flood the streets with cocaine, heroin and cannabis.

He was jailed along with 20 accomplices for taking part in the conspiracy to make millions in drug money and then launder the proceeds.

Close gave off a false pretence of being a charitable and community man, but has now been unmasked 

An investigation by the North West Regional Crime Unit seized £1.2m in cash as well as heroin and cocaine worth more than £200,000

Police arrested Close and his accomplices - which included a convicted killer - last December after a six-month operation called BinBrook. 

In a series of raids by TITAN officers from the North West Regional Crime Unit, around £1.2m, along with the heroin, cocaine and a sawn-off shotgun were seized. 

One of the gang who attempted to flee police in a car nearly hit a woman in a petrol station forecourt before a kilo of cocaine was found in his car. 

At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Close admitted conspiracy to launder money and conspiracy to supply cocaine. 

He laughed and joked in the dock as he was sentenced to a total of 13 years and nine months.

The investigation by the TITAN unit ran for approximately six months and focused on the crime group, that were mainly based in the Leigh area in Greater Manchester

A shotgun belonging to one of the gang members, Patrick Roach, was also discovered by the police - he was jailed for 10 years of conspiracy to supply heroin and  possession of a prohibited weapon and ammunition

Today Detective Superintendent Jason Hudson of the North West Regional Crime Unit said: 'James Close was effectively the patriarch of a crime gang involved in criminality that spanned dirty cash, drugs and firearms.

'He was the pivotal focus of the investigation. He is a well-known criminal from Leigh, a significant person in the organised crime network and a significant drug dealer. His group did significant money laundering on behalf of big organised crime groups

'These men and their associates are involved in crime for the sole purpose of making money, so to hit them so hard and so deep in the pocket by recovering £1.2million - that we believe to have been amassed entirely through their criminal enterprises - is a massive result. 

'It is no exaggeration to say the streets where this gang mostly operated, are much safer.' 

On October 30 2013, police swooped on two cars after a handover of half a kilo of cocaine which led to a dramatic chase, pictured, where one of the gang forced motorists to run for cover

One of Close's gang was seen handing over two bags on a street corner in Leigh to the driver of a Ford Transit van and when police swooped £541,895 (pictured) was found hidden in an elaborate concealment

The investigation by the TITAN unit ran for approximately six months and focused on the crime group, that were mainly based in the Leigh area in Greater Manchester.  

One of Close's gang was seen handing over two bags on a quiet street corner in Leigh to the driver of a Ford Transit van - and when police swooped £541,895 was found hidden in an elaborate concealment controlled by a secret switch. 

Following another cash switch, £470,395  was found at a gang member's house - and set up in the spare bedroom was a sophisticated money counting and packaging operation.

More than £150,000 was recovered from a Mercedes Vito van hidden in an elaborate and electronically controlled concealment and more than £6,000 and a large number of mobile phones were found hidden about a house. 

The sawn-off shotgun and a number of shotgun shells were found in a raid on a Volkswagen van.

In October 2013, police swooped on two cars after a handover of half a kilo of cocaine which led to a dramatic police chase where one of the gang forced motorists to run for cover as he raced across a petrol station before crashing.

Zammit was jailed for nine years and Smith was handed a 12-year prison sentence

Close now faces a Proceeds of Crime hearing which will order him to repay any money he made from criminal activity.

Passing sentence Judge Michael Leeming said: 'As you will be fully aware, cocaine and heroin are dangerous drugs and people can die from them. The courts see day in and day out defendants that stand in the dock, people whose lives have been decimated by addiction to either or both.

'I am not being melodramatic when I say the consumption causes untold misery and degradation. All that misery is caused by people like you who are prepared to involve yourselves in enterprises like this in the hope of some financial advantage. 

'The message must go out that those who engage in these sorts of activity can expect to receive substantial sentences in prison.'
