Apology: Yodel's boss Dick Stead said he was sorry to customers for thousands of parcel delays

The boss of one of the UK's biggest delivery firms has been forced to make an apology over delays that left thousands of consumers fearing their parcels may not arrive in time for Christmas.

The unprecedented rise in internet shopping had led to a huge backlog and some couriers are expecting to work until 9pm tonight to deliver as many packages as possible.

Yodel - which delivers up to a million parcels a day at Christmas for firms including online retailer Amazon - had to stop collecting packages ten days ago due to high demand.

But the backlog was cleared within two days and then deliveries continued as normal. 

Last week the firm's executive chairman Dick Stead said problems had been sorted. But last night he was forced to apologise.

He told the Daily Mirror: 'Unfortunately delays on some parcels are inevitable for a number of reasons, whatever the time of year, regardless of carrier or service they are sent on.

'These can include address queries, poor packaging, mislabelling, traffic incidents and inaccessible properties.' 

He said parcels were flowing through Yodel's sorting offices and they would continue to deliver this evening and would begin again on Saturday.

But when it came to possible compensation, he advised customers to check with retailers because 'we do not have sight of their transaction or agreement'.

He added shoppers should check last order delivery dates with retailers to get a better idea of when their package might arrive. 'We apologise to anyone whose parcels have been delayed', he said.

A spokesman for the company confirmed today that all parcels due to be delivered before Christmas were now either already delivered or out for delivery today.

In a further statement issued today, Mr Stead said: ‘Following reports in a variety of publications this morning regarding a build-up of parcels in the carrier industry, we would like to reassure both our clients and their customers that Yodel has no backlog.

‘We have been delivering around a million parcels a day in the run up to Christmas. Our sort and service centres are working to plan and all parcels that are due to be delivered before Christmas are out for delivery today.

‘Deliveries will continue, as usual, until 9pm and all parcels can be tracked on myyodel.co.uk. Anyone requiring further assistance can contact our customer services, who are available on webchat and social media until 10pm tonight, as well as via telephone until 6pm.’

Brand strategy agency Mash said Yodel risked alienating customers if it failed to pay out for missing delivery deadlines.

Co-founder Jonathan Williams said: 'In times of crisis it could be the making of a brand if they are seen to act appropriately. 

Reassurance: Yodel said on their Twitter feed today that it had no backlog, although this statement was met with a chorus of disapproval from customers

'If a company has let people down then this could present an opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to their consumers.' 

The Centre for Retail Research says 2014 has seen a record amount of online spending.

Around £810million was spent by online shoppers on Black Friday last month. Cyber Monday three days later saw more than £650million spent.

Following the surge in orders, Royal Mail opened ten temporary Christmas parcel sorting centres and hired an extra 19,000 temporary staff.

A spokesman said: 'All our postmen and women have been working very hard to help deliver Christmas for our customers. We believe our network has coped well with the significant extra volume at this time.'

Last month, Yodel also came under fire after dozens of ceramic poppies planted at the Tower of London to commemorate those who died during the First World War arrived at customers' homes broken into pieces.

Disappointed customers who bought one of the £25 red blooms - designed to represent an individual British or Colonial death - were faced with missing parts, smashed petals and shattered edges as the ceramic flowers arrived on their doorsteps.

In one shocking incident, a courier was caught hurling a poppy package 25ft over a garden fence when he was unable to reach the customer's front door.

Yodel, which has been employed by the Historic Royal Palaces to deliver the packages, apologised and said at the time that any workers not treating the parcels with respect would be disciplined.

Less than half of the people who ordered a poppy are still to receive it, with about 300,000 delivered in time for Christmas, out of the vast majority of the 888,246 total earmarked for public sale.

The new retail ombudsman, who takes up his role on January 2, has urged shoppers ordering online that they should always ask the retailer to confirm in writing when the goods will arrive.

Dean Dunham said retailers' contracts with consumers are broken when a promised delivery date is not fulfilled, meaning customers can claim a full refund and ask for compensation in some cases.
