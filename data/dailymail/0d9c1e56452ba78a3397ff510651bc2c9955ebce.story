Chelsea have prepared a dossier of incidents featuring Jan Vertonghen, Jack Wilshere and Joe Hart to present to the Football Association as part of their appeal against Nemanja Matic's three-game ban.

The Serbian midfielder was sent off by Martin Atkinson on Saturday for his reaction to Burnley forward Ashley Barnes' challenge that was labelled an 'end of career' foul by Blues manager Jose Mourinho.

Chelsea are appealing the length of Matic's suspension and hope that by flagging up other similar decisions that the FA will cut the sentence.

The five incidents - none of which saw the culprits banned - picked out for inclusion are taken from the last four months of the season and aim to show that Matic's ban is excessive compared.
