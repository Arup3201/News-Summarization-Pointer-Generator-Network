A customer complained about seeing mice scurrying round a sushi restaurant, only to return a week later to find the eatery was still serving customers and more than 10 rodents were running around floors and counters.

Craig Dumpleton contacted the chief executive of YO! Sushi after he spotted the animals running round a branch in Baker Street in London one evening when the restaurant was already closed.

But despite receiving a reply saying the incident would be investigated 'immediately' and they took any claims seriously. The 33-year-old returned a week later to find that the number had doubled from five to ten and the mice appeared to be  unperturbed.

Craig Dumpleton spotted mice running round the floors and counters of YO! Sushi in Baker Street in London, returning a week later to find 10 of the animals in the restaurant and recorded the footage on his mobile phone

Mr Dumpleton, a father of two, said: 'The first time my friend saw this movement out the corner of his eye. We thought it was a rat because it was so big.

'We went to take a closer look and it was huge mouse scurrying around between the counters and the serving area in the restaurant.

'There was about five of them. It was disgusting. One was even on the counter top just sitting there. 

'They were obviously used to it because we banged on the window and they weren't even bothered.

'I was back there a week later and I couldn't believe it, there was double the amount. They were running all over the place.

'I'd already complained so all I can think is that they just aren't bothered about getting rid of them.'

He claims staff had covered part of the windows with black bags or paint after he complained. 

Mr Dumpleton, 33, recorded footage of the mice scrabbling around the sushi restaurant on his mobile phone 

However YO! Sushi said these coverings were put up after pest control were sent in immediately after his first complaint to deal with the problem.

Mr Dumpleton, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, said he first saw the mice on October 12 after arranging to meet friends at the sushi bar. 

He got there late, by which time his friends had eaten, and had a post-meal drink with them nearby.

On the walk home they looked in through windows of YO! Sushi and saw the mice running across the wooden floor.

Craig emailed chief executive Vanessa Hall two days later who replied saying she would 'investigate immediately' and offered him a gift card and a restaurant tour.

Mr Dumpleton complained after he claims he twice saw mice running around YO! Sushi in Baker Street, London, but the company said it has completely resolved the problem and sent in pest control immediately

Her email added: 'We take any incident of this nature extremely seriously, working hard on ensuring immediate resolution.'

But a week later after his first visit, Craig walked past again and said he saw at least ten mice running around again.

He claimed: 'One was going to the toilet in the middle of the restaurant.

'The last thing I want to do is go there for a meal.'

YO! Sushi has 76 restaurants in seven countries, with 65 in the UK.

A spokesman for YO! Sushi said: 'We operate a very stringent health and safety regime across all our restaurants. We responded immediately to this enquiry in mid-October.

'Our pest control contractors resolved the problem straight away and we also elevated the matter to our landlords and adjoining London Underground. We are now entirely satisfied that the issue has been resolved.'
