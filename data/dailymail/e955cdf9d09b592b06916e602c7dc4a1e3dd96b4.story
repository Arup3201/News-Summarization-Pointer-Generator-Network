High street giant H&M is among almost 40 companies named and shamed by the government for failing to pay workers the minimum wage.

The retailer failed to pay a total of £2,604.87 to 540 staff, according to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. 

A total of 37 employers including hair salons, car dealers and estate agents underpaid staff by £177,000, behaviour condemned by ministers as 'illegal, immoral and completely unacceptable'.

Welcome Break, the service station company, neglected to pay £1,318.70 to 19 workers. 

Hertfordshire estate agents Kings Group underpaid 43 members of staff by £53,808.91 while the company's lettings arm neglected to pay £26,893.43 to 49 workers.

The 37 firms listed by the government face financial penalties totalling more than £51,000.

Business minister Jo Swinson said: 'Paying less than the minimum wage is illegal, immoral and completely unacceptable. 

'If employers break this law they need to know that we will take tough action by naming, shaming and fining them as well as helping workers recover the hundreds of thousands of pounds in pay owed to them.

'We are also looking at what more we can do to make sure workers are paid fairly in the first place. As well as being publicly named and shamed, employers that fail to pay their workers the national minimum wage face penalties of up to £20,000.

'We are legislating through the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Bill so that this penalty can be applied to each underpaid worker rather than per employer.'

Business minister Jo Swinson said: 'Paying less than the minimum wage is illegal, immoral and completely unacceptable'

Almost 100 employers have now been publicly named by the Government since a new regime came into force in October 2013.

Unions have been pressing for larger fines against firms found to be paying less than the statutory rate of £6.50 an hour for adults, £5.13 for 18 to 20-year-olds, £3.79 for 16 and 17-year-olds and £2.73 for apprentices.

TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: 'It's good to see the Government getting tough on bad bosses who cheat hard-working employees out of the pay they're legally entitled to. But with over 600 employers being caught underpaying each year, those named and shamed today are only the tip of the iceberg.

'There are companies out there that cheat hundreds of staff out of a legal minimum wage - these are the biggest offenders and their pay crimes must be made public too. Ministers must also step up enforcement action with more prosecutions, higher fines and a bigger team of enforcement officers to catch the cheats.'

The TUC recently published a 10 point plan for minimum wage enforcement, including a call for much higher fines.

Philip Pepper, employment law partner at Shakespeares, said: 'There are a number of reasons why employers may have got this wrong or been caught out. It is most likely due to human error, but in some cases minimum wage regulations can be complex to apply.'
