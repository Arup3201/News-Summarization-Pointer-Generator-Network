Everton reserves striker Conor McAleny has signed a new three-year contract with the club.

The 21-year-old striker, an academy graduate, broke his leg while on loan at Brentford last August and missed much of last season.

After speaking to manager Roberto Martinez, McAleny is keen to break into the senior side now he has returned to full fitness.

New deal: Conor McAleny has signed a new contract with Everton

'He called me up a few weeks ago and we had a good chat. That was massive for me,' McAleny, who made two first-team appearances as a substitute in 2011-12, told evertontv.

'He told me I was going to be in his plans and that was a big part of why I have signed.

'I want to get as close as I can to the first team, make some appearances and hopefully chip in with a few goals if possible.'
