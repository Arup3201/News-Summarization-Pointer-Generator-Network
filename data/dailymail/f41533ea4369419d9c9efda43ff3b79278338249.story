Shocking CCTV pictures show the moment a brave dad was battered with a crowbar as he tried to stop a gang of robbers raiding his home.

Five thugs burst into the man's house in Balmoral Road in the Erdington area of Birmingham on the evening of March 6 and demanded cash and gold.

The gang threatening the victimâ€™s son with the weapon and told the terrified family to hand over their valuables.

The father, who has not been named by police, then stepped in to try and protect his son.

But the gang lashed out at the man with the crowbar, striking him across the knuckles. Luckily however, he was not serious injured.

The thieves then made off with an iPod and jewellery including four gold bangles, a gold diamond ring and leaf-effect gold earrings.

CCTV images show some of the robbers dressed in light-coloured hoodies with the drawstrings pulled tight beneath their faces. The gang member armed with a crowbar also wore a mask.

Images show one of the group, a man in glasses, was not wearing a hood, and his face can be clearly seen beneath his baseball cap.

The gang made off with items of 'both sentimental and monetary value', police said

The armed robbers, some of whom wore hooded tops, broke into the family home at around 6:30pm on March 6

Detective Constable Dan Smith, from the serious acquisitive crime team, said: 'We are working closely with the community in the area as well as scrutinising CCTV footage capturing the incident.

'While nobody was seriously injured, this is a nasty robbery for a family to have experienced where they have lost items of sentimental and monetary value.

'If anyone, especially pawnbrokers have been approached to buy any of the jewellery matching the descriptions around this time, we urge them to contact the police.'

He has asked anyone with information to contact police or leave information anonymously by calling independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Police have released CCTV images of the men in the hope witnesses will come forward with information
