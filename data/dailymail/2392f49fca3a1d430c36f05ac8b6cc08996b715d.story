An aspiring model who used stolen credit cards to pay for expensive cosmetic surgery to bolster her fledgling career  walked free from court today.

Faileigh Cooper, 23, splashed £6,850 on liposuction and lip enhancements with around £4,000 coming from stolen card details she was given by a man she met in a nightclub.

Cooper, who is now two months pregnant, told the court she ‘dreamed of being a model’ and claimed she had no idea the card details she used were stolen.

Convicted: Faileigh Cooper, 23, seen arriving at Southwark Crown Court during her five-day trial, used stolen credit cards to pay for cosmetic surgery in an attempt to improve her prospects of making it as a model

She also alleged that the surgery had left her with a burnt arm and was considering legal action.

Prosecutors said she was part of a plot with the man she said she knew only as 'Aaron' to defraud the Dr Alexandra Chambers Medical and Aesthetic Practice, on Wimpole Street, central London.

The pair were said to have repeatedly called the surgery where Cooper paid a £500 deposit to pay the balance, with around £4,000 coming from the stolen cards.

During the trial, jurors heard Cooper booked her treatment and paid a £500 deposit before paying the rest over the phone using a variety of cards.

Cooper and 'Aaron' called the surgery 14 times between February 21 and February 23 last year using both legitimate and fraudulent cards to pay off the balance.

The clinic was later informed that the card payments were fraudulent, leaving them out of pocket.

When asked by her legal team if she had ‘any reason to doubt’ that the cards belonged to 'Aaron’ she replied: ‘No’.

She described Aaron as ‘very flashy’ and said when she first met him in a club he had been ‘trying to get a lot of attention buying bottles of champagne costing over £200’.

Spared jail: Cooper was not ordered to pay legal costs and compensation because her conviction at Southwark Crown Court means she is likely to lose her job and be unable to afford the fines

Cooper said: ‘He offered to pay so he would then contact the clinic and pay the full amount.’

She insisted she believed the card did belong to ‘Aaron’, who later told Cooper he was too busy to make the payments and asked her to try for him and supplied the details.

The Judge, Mr Recorder James Mulholland QC, told her: ‘You made a series of false representations to Dr Alexandra Chambers Medical and Aesthetic Practice by using a series of eight cards, many of which did not belong to you.

‘This was a very strange case in many ways.

‘It struck me that it was almost inevitable that you would be apprehended as the surgery had your name and the address at which you resided.

‘But equally the evidence and the jury’s verdict that you would have had to have known through the number of cards, the way they were used, the constant rejections and re-submissions that what you were doing was dishonest cause it just could not have been operated in any other fashion.’

The former House of Fraser and BBC Children in Need model, of Battersea, southwest London, had denied four counts of fraud, was convicted by a jury of four counts of fraud after a five day trial in April.

Cooper was convicted and given a 12 month community order and told to carry out 80 hours of unpaid work.

An application for £4,000 in compensation and a contribution of £1,875 towards prosecution costs was reject on the grounds Cooper’s conviction would see her lose her job and she would have no money to pay.

‘I feel it would be wrong in the circumstance to impose any such order,’ said the judge.

Prosecutor Orla Daly said today: ‘The four convictions for fraud relate to the use of credit cards in order to pay for cosmetic procedures which she was not entitled to use.’
