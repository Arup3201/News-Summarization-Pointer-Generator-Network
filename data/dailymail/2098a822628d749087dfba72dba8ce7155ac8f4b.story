Peaked? Two and a Half Men co-creator Lee Aronsohn sparked outrage when he said the TV market is over-saturated with women's comedies

Lee Aronsohn, the co-creator of the CBS comedy Two and a Half Men is in hot water for saying female-oriented comedies have reached the point of saturation.

Speaking with the Hollywood Reporter at the Toronto Screenwriting Conference, he said: ‘Enough, ladies, I get it. You have periods.’

He complained of the latest batch of comedy shows targeted toward women, including 2 Broke Girls and Whitney.

He added: ‘But we’re approaching peak vagina on television, the point of labia saturation.’

But Aronsohn, 59, who is married and has three children, didn’t stop there.

He said that the show focuses on ‘damaged men. What makes men damaged? Sorry, it’s women. I never got my heart broken by a man.’

The show has portrayed women in a less-than-flattering light from its inception, led for eight seasons by Charlie Sheen.

The show has unapologetically made jokes at the expense of women since season one – for being stupid, overweight, slutty, and for having breasts that are too large or too small.

The comments struck a chord, especially with female comedy writers, actors, and critics – Raising Hope actress Martha Plimpton wrote on Twitter: ‘Um, Lee, women are 51 per cent of the population & a coveted demographic for advertisers. What are you thinking?’

Manly men: Charlie Sheen, left, and Jon Cryer were leads in the comedy, which has often been called misogynistic

Over-saturated: The producer complained that shows like 2 BROKE GIRLS are saturating the market

Are there too many comedy shows geared towards women on American TV?

She added: ‘The rise of female writers and performers in television is a result of demand. So we’re taking our place at the creative table.’

The Daily Show co-creator Lizz Winstead responded to Aronsohn’s comment with a snarky comment. 

‘You realise that if we are at Peak vagina, the prices at the pump are gonna skyrocket.’

Former New Yorker television critic Nancy Franklin encouraged other Twitter users to Aronsohn’s page, writing: ‘Lee Aronsohn’s twitter handle is @bennyace if your overexposed lady parts want to send him a message.’

Lady shows: He also criticised the NBC comedy Whitney

Blerg: Other shows, like NBC's 30 Rock feature female protagonists; Tina Fey stars as the hilarious, snack-obsessed Liz Lemon

According to the New York Times’ Arts Beat blog, Aronsohn responded with his own snide remark, saying: ‘Women, please look up “irony.”’

The comment was later deleted from his feed.

He replaced it instead with a seemingly flippant apology. ‘Yes, yes – it was a stupid joke. I’m sorry.’ 

Aside from producing Two and a Half Men, Aronsohn produced several shows with female leads, such as Grace Under Fire and Murphy Brown.

He has three children, ages 23 and 20 from his first marriage, and a four-year-old from his second.
