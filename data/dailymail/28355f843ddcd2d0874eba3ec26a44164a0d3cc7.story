Lawsuit: Lena Dunham has threatened to sue the website Truth Revolt for millions of dollars after they accused her of being a sexual abuser last week 

Lena Dunham is now threatening to sue the right-wing website which last week published an article claiming she sexually abused her little sister when they were children.

The claim is based on an excerpt from the Girls star and creator's new book, Not That Kind of Girl, and details how she once looked at her sister Grace's vagina when her sibling was a year old and she was seven. 

Lena defended the action as innocent childhood exploration based on curiosity, but the website Truth Revolt called the memory 'unsettling' and 'disturbing'.

Since then, she has been in a war of words with the site, which refused to take down or apologize for their piece titled 'Lena Dunham Describes Sexually Abusing Her Little Sister'.

On Tuesday, the website claimed that the actress was threatening to sue them and that was confirmed today when The Hollywood Reporter published the full cease and desist letter written by Lena's lawyers. 

In the letter, attorney Charles Harder calls the Truth Revolt article 'completely false and fabricated, and highly defamatory of' his client. 

He goes on to demand the website take the article down and apologize for it, or else face a multi-million dollar lawsuit. 

If they don't follow instructions to take the article down, Harder says Lena will 'vigorously pursue all legal remedies'. 

The website adamantly declined, and editor Ben Shapiro wrote another article on Tuesday explaining why they would not heed to the demands of Lena's lawyers. 

'We refuse. We refuse to withdraw our story or apologize for running it, because quoting a woman’s book does not constitute a “false” story, even if she is a prominent actress and left-wing activist. 

'Lena Dunham may not like our interpretation of her book, but unfortunately for her and her attorneys, she wrote that book – and the First Amendment covers a good deal of material she may not like, the article reads.

Allegations: In a story published last week, Truth Revolt writes that Lena (right) sexually abused her little sister Grace (left) when they were children. The claim is based on a personal essay included in Lena's new book  

The passage that Truth Revolt excerpted details a conversation that then 7-year-old Lena had with her mother, famed artist Laurie Simmons, about women's organs.

In the course of the conversation, young Lena asks her mother if little sister Grace's vagina looks like hers.

'I guess so, Just smaller,' her mother responds

'One day, as I sat in our driveway in Long Island playing with blocks and buckets, my curiosity got the best of me,' Dunham writes  

Memory: In Not That Kind of Girl, Lena writes about looking at her then 1-year-old sister Grace's vagina out of curiosity after talking with their mother about the female reproductive system. Lena was seven at the time. Grace Dunham pictured at a film screening last June

'Grace was sitting up, babbling and smiling, and I leaned down between her legs and carefully spread open her vagina. She didn’t resist and when I saw what was inside I shrieked.

'My mother came running. “Mama, Mama! Grace has something in there!”

'My mother didn’t bother asking why I had opened Grace’s vagina. This was within the spectrum of things I did. 

'She just got on her knees and looked for herself. It quickly became apparent that Grace had stuffed six or seven pebbles in there. My mother removed them patiently while Grace cackled, thrilled that her prank had been a success.'  

It was also in the book that Lena described coaxing her sister for affection. 

'As [Grace] grew, I took to bribing her for her time and affection: one dollar in quarters if I could do her makeup like a 'motorcycle chick.' Three pieces of candy if I could kiss her on the lips for five seconds. 

'Whatever she wanted to watch on TV if she would just 'relax on me.' Basically, anything a sexual predator might to do woo a small suburban girl I was trying.'

Truth Revolt  called this passages 'unsettling' and 'disturbing' in an article titled  'Lena Dunham Describes Sexually Abusing Her Little Sister'

The article reads: 'Lena Dunham describes experimenting sexually with her younger sister Grace, whom she says she attempted to persuade to kiss her using “anything a sexual predator might do.” 

In one particularly unsettling passage, Dunham experimented with her six-year younger sister’s vagina.' 

They also originally wrote that Dunham was 17 at the time of the incident, and later added a correction saying 'This article has been modified to correct a typo in the book excerpt incorrectly listing Dunham's age as seventeen'. 

Lena initially addressed the claims in a Twitter rant over the weekend, and spoke out against the story again on Tuesday with a statement to Time magazine, writing how she was 'dispayed' with the interpretation of the story.   

'First and foremost, I want to be very clear that I do not condone any kind of abuse under any circumstances.

'Childhood sexual abuse is a life-shattering event for so many, and I have been vocal about the rights of survivors. 

'If the situations described in my book have been painful or triggering for people to read, I am sorry, as that was never my intention. 

'I am also aware that the comic use of the term “sexual predator” was insensitive, and I’m sorry for that as well,' Lena writes, adding that her sister is her best friend and supported her publishing the childhood memory in her book.     

In the wake of the allegations, Lena has cancelled two stops on her book tour scheduled this week in Belgium and Germany claiming she is having health issues.

On Monday,  she tweeted that she was 'deeply sorry' to miss the Antwerp Book Fair and a signing in Berlin, adding that she's 'so grateful for your energy and support'.

'If Ms. Dunham says that our quotations from her book were “false,” or that our interpretation of those events was libelous under the law, then we look forward to asking her, in her deposition, about why they appeared in her book,' editor Ben Shapiro wrote on Tuesday.

'We also look forward to asking her why she believes it is now appropriate for a 28-year-old woman to make light of opening her baby sister’s vagina, paying her with candies for prolonged kisses on the lips in the manner of a “sexual predator,” or masturbating in bed next to her prepubescent sister,' he added.  

Grace Dunham also appears to have responded to the allegations in her own Twitter rant on Monday, writing vaguely about heternormativity and what is and is not considered 'normal' behavior. 

Grace writes that she supports writers 'narrating their own experiences, determining for themselves what has and has not been harmful'. 

She also posted: '2day, like every other day, is a good day to think about how we police the sexualities of young women, queer, and trans people.'

While the tweets seem to address the criticism of her sister's essay, they do not directly come out and support the personal story that her sister shared with the world. 

The sisters appear to have a difference of opinion on the Truth Revolt article, according to one tweet Lena wrote on Saturday. 

'Sometimes I get so mad I burn write up. Also, I wish my sister wasn't laughing so hard,' Dunham tweeted on November 1.
