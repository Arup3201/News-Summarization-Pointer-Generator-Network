A mother who is believed to have killed herself and her three-year-old son after jumping in front of a train had made an attempt on her own life just months ago, it has been claimed today.

Donna Oettinger, 41, jumped into the path of an oncoming train at Riddlesdown station, near Croydon, with their son Zaki on Friday.

Her Egyptian husband Mohamed Nahr discovered that his wife - who had told him four months ago that she felt suicidal - had dragged their child in front of a speeding train after a friend told him to 'check the internet'.

He has today spoken out, asking: 'Why did she even think about something like this... he was only a baby'

Ms Oettinger - who killed herself and her three-year-old son by jumping in front of a train had tried to commit suicide just months ago, it has been revealed today

Ms Oettinger started to suffer from depression last April when her Mr Nahr was not allowed to come and live in the UK because of Visa issues.

He told the Sun: 'I am never going to sleep. I am never going to eat. He was part of me. He was my world.'

A friend of Ms Oettinger said that the tragedy could have been avoided, adding that the mother had been let down by 'doctors and the NHS'.

The friend, who did not want to be named, told the Mirror that she had been to see a doctor up to 50 times since November to ask for help.

They added: 'She tried to commit suicide in December and she was in intensive care for two days.

'Everyone was told she might die. We said she needed to go into a psychiatric hospital. Her mum begged two psychiatrists to put her away.'

Mr Nahr said he discovered what had happened when a friend called him to say there was 'bad news' and urged him to go on the internet, where he saw from online reports that his family had died.

He told The Sunday Times: 'I've lost my family. I've lost my son and I've lost my Donna.'

He said that when Ms Oettinger had told him that she was suicidal he had begged her to consider their son, but claimed she had said she would give their child to her mother and sister to care for Zaki.

He said that Ms Oettinger had become depressed after suffering a miscarriage in 2009 and two of her close friends who had battled cancer had passed away.

The couple's little boy had only celebrated his third birthday
a week ago.

Close friends and family were today offering their support to Mr Nahr who had been in a long-term relationship with Ms Oettinger since April 2008.

Incident: Donna Oettinger and her three-year-old son Zackary, nicknamed 
Zaki, are both believed to have been killed at 
Riddlesdown Station near Purley, Surrey, on Friday

Tragedy: Donna's child Zaki had just celebrated his third birthday according to neighbours, and was much-loved in their street just 300 metres from the station where they 
died

Close friend Tanya Bowen Pearce Ray 
wrote on his Facebook page: 'will ring you again tonight...wish we 
could be there with you...stay strong xx'

Ms Oettinger had written a series of 
harrowing messages leading up to her death in which she told how she was
'so scared I don't know who I am any more'.

In another of the internet messages, 
Oettinger, who suffered anxiety attacks and depression, wrote: 'Thank 
God I have my son Zaki. I owe him a lot when I get better. Love you son 
with all my heart xxx'.

Ms Oettinger, who worked for a haulage company, was understood to have been suffering from severe depression.

She had been battling anxiety since 
May last year and had been prescribed medication to fight it. 
Unfortunately, her treatment did not seem to be working. She wrote a 
message to friends on Facebook which said: ‘So scared. Don’t know who I 
am any more.’

And in another she said: ‘Feeling so depressed. Dread waking up.’

'The tragedy took place at  Riddlesdown Station near Purley, in Surrey.

One rail worker, who did not want to be named, said the driver was in a state of shock.

The mother and son were killed when they were hit by the train.

Passengers were ordered to stay in 
their carriages for more than 90 minutes after the double fatality. 
Commuter Paul Camlett, 38, said: ‘I had just arrived at the station when
the station master rounded everyone up and ordered them off the 
platform.

‘I’m in complete shock. People were crying.’

Last night detectives were searching Ms Oettinger’s house, which is 300 yards from the station.

One neighbour said: ‘I heard about 
two fatalities on the radio this morning but I had no idea it was them. 
Poor Zaki. I’ve only just moved in but I have seen the mother a few 
times. Zaki was such a sweet little boy. Always so happy.

‘I saw her just yesterday, I’m a child-minder and she saw me with two screaming children – she looked at me with pity.

‘She was always rushing around with 
him. Last time I saw her his blanket was hanging down, I told her 
because it was getting dirty.

‘It’s a real tragedy. To hear this 
I’m just in shock.’ Ms Oettinger was understood to have lived with her
mother Carol. Last night her relatives were too upset to talk about 
their loss.

Zaki’s father Mohamed Nasr is understood to be an Egyptian who lives in Sharm el Sheikh.

Detective Chief Inspector Iain

although early indications show that no one else was believed to have 
been involved.’
