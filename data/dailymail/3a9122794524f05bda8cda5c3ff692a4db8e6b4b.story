The woman who Texas Ebola victim, Thomas Eric Duncan, had traveled to the States to marry, has not been able to speak with him since his condition was downgraded to critical, MailOnline can reveal.

Louise Troh had been in daily telephone contact with Mr Duncan since his admission to hospital last Sunday.

Now as Mr Duncan fights for his life, MailOnline has been told that Ms Troh is ‘living moment by moment,’ unable to contact him and tormented by the knowledge that that she and her 13-year-old son and two nephews currently quarantined with her, could develop symptoms at any time.

Prayers were offered up on Sunday for Ms Troh, Mr Duncan and all affected by this, the first Ebola outbreak on US soil, at Wilshire Baptist Church, Dallas, where Ms Troh is a member.

Speaking to MailOnline following the service Senior Pastor George Mason, who is in daily contact with Ms Troh, gave the first insight into how the woman at the center of the crisis is coping as Mr Duncan’s condition worsens.

He said , ‘She is struggling to manage really with all the consequences of Eric’s illness and the fear of what might happen to him.

‘And with the minute by minute question of what might be happening to her and to her son and nephews who are with her in quarantine.’

It is two days since Ms Troh and the other quarantined occupants of the now infamous Ivy Apartments were moved to a secret location in a gated community within city limits.

County Judge Clay Jenkins who said that the faith community had donated the home drove the family there personally.

A Wilshire Baptist Church spokesman today confirmed that they were supporting the move financially and had been providing meals for the family. The location was chosen by Mayor Mike Rawlings and Mr Jenkins.

According to Pastor Mason, ‘Louise is doing better since being moved to another house. That is giving her a sense of relief but she is eager for this to be over.’

This is the second tragedy to befall Ms Troh who is regarded as the matriarch of her large family, Pastor Mason revealed.

Earlier this year one her three adult daughters died in childbirth in Liberia at the age of 38.

Two daughters remained in Liberia when Ms Troh moved to the US more than a decade ago after a ‘falling out’ with Mr Duncan by whom she has a 19-year-old son, currently a student in Texas.

Ms Troh’s other adult daughter, Youngor Jallah, 35, lives in Dallas and is in quarantine along with her four children ages 2 to 11 having tended to Mr Duncan and traveled with him to hospital last Sunday.

Her husband Aaron Yah, 43, was last week told by CDC officials that he could return to work as a nursing assistant.’

According to Pastor Mason, Mr Troh visited Monrovia earlier this year and, ‘reconnected with Eric.’

He explained, ‘Their relationship never led to marriage in Liberia, but in recent times she had returned to Monrovia and they had reconnected and he was eager to come to the States.’

After so many years living in the US, Ms Troh is a naturalized citizen, Pastor Mason said. Mr Duncan entered the country on a tourist visa but his forthcoming marriage could have sped the process for his own naturalization or green card if he chose to apply.

Pastor Mason said, ‘He had applied for a visa and it had taken quite a while to come through so he was excited when actually he got the visa and was planning to come here and visit with me about having a wedding and starting a new life. He was looking forward to seeing the woman he loved and reconnect with his son.’

He added, ‘I think it’s important to know that chronology. This was not a quick decision to leave Liberia upon a sense of his having been exposed.’

Just how ‘eager’ Mr Duncan was to come to America – and remain here – has been a subject of intense scrutiny and controversy across the past week.

Liberian authorities have now claimed that he lied on exit documents, answering ‘No’ to specific questions regarding whether or not he had been in contact with or involved in the treatment of someone infected with the Ebola virus.

Pastor Mason said that he had addressed this revelation with members of his church.

He said, ‘If he did lie he will be held accountable and it's not up to us to stand in the way of that process.

‘But he hasn’t had a chance to give his own account and let’s be honest, Liberia has good reason to not want to appear to have messed up here.’

The day before he had been due to leave Liberia, Mr Duncan carried a pregnant Ebola sufferer to her home where she later died.

Addressing the anger this revelation has prompted, Pastor Mason said, ‘Let’s be honest. He had just been holding this pregnant young woman in his arms and taken her home because she could not get care in Liberia and watched her die.

‘And even if he knew he was exposed, that is – if he were to stay – what he would know would be the outcome very soon for him.

‘If he came to America with the best health care system in the world and acknowledgement worldwide that we have had aid workers who had contracted this and who have recovered he would know he stood a chance.

‘I don’t excuse him if he did intentionally conceal that information. But it’s certainly understandable that he might have.’

However ‘understandable’ Mr Duncan’s motivations , the recklessness of his alleged lie in order to secure his transit to the States has now put the lives of all who came into direct contact with him in danger, as well as countless others’ should the Communicative Diseases Center fail to contain the virus.

Yesterday their assertion that the situation was under control was dealt a severe blow with CDC’s admission that they had ‘lost’ the homeless man who had travelled in the ambulance in which Mr Duncan had been vomiting violently.

But, for now, Pastor Mason said his focus, and that of his church was on providing what support they can for Ms Troh as her fiancés condition worsens.

He said, ‘We have assured her that until the end of this period of 21 days that she has to endure, regardless of the outcome of Eric’s illness, positive or negative, we’ll walk beside her and help her to rebuild her life as much as possible.’
