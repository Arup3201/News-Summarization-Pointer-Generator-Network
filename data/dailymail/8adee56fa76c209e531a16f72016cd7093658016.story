Low-emission electric cars will be introduced across Whitehall - but David Cameron will be keeping his Jaguar and Range Rover until his 'heightened security needs' are considered

Prime Minister David Cameron could swap his ministerial limousine for an electric car under plans to make Whitehall's vehicle fleet greener.

Charging points for electric cars will be installed in Downing Street and a Cabinet minister said he expected all members of the Government ‘will want to be at the forefront of this’.

Under the plans, the use of vehicles by Government departments will be reviewed and where appropriate ultra-low emission alternatives will be procured.

But the Prime Minister's heavily modified and armoured Jaguar XJ limousine and Range Rover support vehicles would not be immediately replaced, as security concerns would need to be addressed in assessing any potential alternative.

However, engineers at Jaguar Land Rover in Coventry and Warwickshire are already developing hybrid petrol-electric power – including work at a new advanced propulsion centre at University of Warwick - for their future vehicles so the wait may not be too long.

Under the first phase of the scheme, around 150 electric cars and vans will replace existing vehicles across Whitehall.

The programme will then be expanded to allow the wider public sector including councils, police forces and the NHS, to introduce around 135 more plug-in vehicles. In both phases, charge points will also be installed to provide infrastructure support for the new cars and vans.

Transport minister Baroness Kramer said: ‘Government must lead by example. Today's investment will see government switching a significant number of plug-in cars and vans into our fleets and leading the electric charge.’

Cabinet Office minister Oliver Letwin said the infrastructure for electric cars was being installed in the heart of Government: ‘We are extremely anxious to use the Government's purchasing power to increase the chances that the British public as a whole will take up electric vehicles.

‘May I say as part of that, after some investigation, we have actually managed to establish a team to put proper charging points up and down Downing Street so that we can also run electric vehicles in Downing Street itself.’

Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, pictured here looking at plug-in cars with Deputy Prime Minster Nick Clegg, said the move would lead to 'much lower running costs and close to zero emissions'

Asked if Mr Cameron would be using an electric car, Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander said: ‘Part of the programme here is about working with different parts of Government to work out where electric vehicles can best meet the needs of individual departments and individual ministers.

‘Clearly where there are heightened security needs - there are particular issues in relation to that which would need to be addressed, but I think that every member of the Government will want to be at the forefront of this.

'It's one of the many industries where we see the UK absolutely at the cutting edge.'

Mr Alexander said he hoped to be 'one of the first in line' to use an electric car, adding: 'This is the right thing to do, with much lower running costs and close to zero emissions, these vehicles will save the taxpayer money and be much greener.'

The £5million ultra low emission vehicle (ULEV) readiness project is the first step in plans to make electric cars and other plug-in vehicles commonplace in government fleets.

The Government Car Service, which provides cars for ministers, has already begun its review and plans to order the first electric cars in the autumn.
