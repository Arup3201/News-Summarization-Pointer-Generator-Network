Mutliplayer gaming is entering the next generation. And perhaps no title shows just how far online warfare has evolved better than Titanfall.

This first-person shooter is a timed exclusive for Xbox One from Respawn Entertainment and EA where players take sides choosing either the Militia or IMC in a story-driven multiplayer experience.

At Gamescom, Daily Mail Games went hands-on in a 6 vs 6 match-up where as the Militia force, the team is sent to extract a pilot who is key to the resistance but are intercepted by the IMC (Interstellar Manufacturing Corporation) and a battle ensues.

Awesome: The battles are incredibly fun to play - especially when wielding some of the mechs ' weaponry

At the beginning players are able to select the load-out of their character and their Titan ranging from anti-Titan to short-range weaponry.

The pace and gameplay Titanfall has to offer look superb. Titan’s are on a timer and can be called in to stand and defend on their own or be entered and controlled by you, the player.

Titan’s are hugely powerful but also a big target for enemies, one of the more enjoyable tactics is flanking a Titan and jumping onto their backs to quickly deplete their health from close range.

The maps can be traversed without having to touch the ground. Players are able to jump, double jump, run along walls and easily travel along rooftops. This allows for another dimension of gameplay with many players seeking the best vantage point on the map.

Characters with have their own traits and progression with a lot of in-game context and storyline. One great addition is the new ending provided to the multiplayer game.

In the game mode previewed, Attrition, instead of a score limit being reached and people and kicked back to a lobby, Titanfall introduces the Epilogue; the losing team must make their way to the dropship for extraction within a given time limit whilst the winning team has to hunt down the escaping losers before they make it.

No boundaries: There is bucket-loads of character progression as well as an engrossing storyline

A simple but ingenious addition gives a great turn on how to end a multiplayer FPS experience.
