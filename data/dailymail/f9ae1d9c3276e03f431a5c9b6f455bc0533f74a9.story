From spinning to Zumba classes, there are always new ways to try and make the dreaded exercise regime more fun.

And now, a new exercise device that has taken America by storm has landed in the UK and the makers claim that it could revolutionise the way people work out.

Hydrofit is a bath-like contraption that contains an exercise bike or treadmill and power jets that massage you whilst you cycle or walk within the water.

Water workout: The new Hydrofit bikes promise to burn 600 calories an hour by allowing users to cycle in the water whilst being massaged by jets

Each individual bike or treadmill is situated within a hydro-massage bathtub with sixteen water jets generating a steady release of oxygen atoms to promote natural exfoliation and skin rejuvenation.

Like any other exercise bike, the 
Hydrofit targets the lower body, offering a workout to the quadriceps and 
buttocks, with general overall benefit to cardiovascular health.

Effective: Makers say that the hydro-massage jets stimulates the breakdown of cellulite and creation of muscle tissue, detoxing and encouraging lymphatic draining and improving metabolism

But its makers say that the machines, based in the Hydrofit Centre in Chelsea, London, offer many benefits that regular bike workouts cannot.

They say that the hydro-massage jets stimulate the breakdown of cellulite and creation of muscle tissue, detoxing and encouraging 
lymphatic draining and improving metabolism.

Using the Hydrofit promises to burn a minimum of 300 Calories in 30 minutes and claims to encourage a reduction in cellulite through a process of exfoliation and massage.

Entertainment: The water only comes up to your waist so each individual pod has a TV, music device and also has a Bluetooth headset for making private phone calls

The makers of Hydrofit maintain that the concept has been designed to make a user's biking/jogging/walking experience 'enjoyable, pleasant and fun'.

The water only comes up to your waist so each individual pod allows users to watch TV, listen to music and also has a Bluetooth headset for making private phone calls.

While it is aimed at those who want to get fit, the makers also say it is good for joint recovery and muscle development so recommend it for use alongside physiotherapy treatment.
