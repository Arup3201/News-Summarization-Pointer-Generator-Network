She famously took flight with an umbrella, but Mary Poppins will no longer be the only flying nanny.

Now, eight decades after the character was created by author Pamela Travers, Etihad Airways is hiring 500 on-board British-style nannies to cope with screaming babies and over-excitable children.

The Abu Dhabi-based carrier, which sponsors Manchester City FC, is training staff using the famous nanny school Norland College in Bath, Somerset, to have on long-haul flights by the end of this year.

Big job: The 'flying nannies' in bright orange aprons - who have been in training for the past two months - will provide help to families as well as unaccompanied children on flights and reduce disruption

Up in the air: Mary Poppins was first created by author Pamela Travers in the 1930s before being famously portrayed by Julie Andrews (pictured) in the 1964 Disney film. A stage musical was also opened in 2004

The 'flying nannies' in bright orange 
aprons - who have been in training for the past two months - will 
provide help to families as well as unaccompanied children on flights 
and reduce disruption.

Their
training includes child psychology courses, how to engage with children
and how to entertain them. The airline gave one example of the staff 
being trained in origami.

Aubrey
Tiedt, vice president of guest services at Etihad Airways, said: 
‘Flying with a young family can be a daunting task, even for the most 
experienced travellers.

‘The
“flying nanny” role demonstrates our understanding of our guests' needs
and our commitment to making the journey as relaxing and comfortable as
possible.’

She added: ‘The flying nanny will liaise with parents and use their experience and knowledge to make the travel experience easier.

‘This includes helping serve children's meals early in the flight and offering activities and challenges to help entertain and occupy younger guests.’

The service will also include advice offered on baby changing rooms, crechés and other airport facilities when passengers arrive.

Poppins was first created by Travers in the 1930s before being famously portrayed by Julie Andrews in the 1964 Disney film. A stage musical was also produced and opened in the West End in 2004.

The story centres around nanny Poppins, who helps two banker’s children magically explore the world around them, with songs such as Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious and A Spoonful of Sugar.
