Party: Jennifer Houle disappeared during a night out with a friend in Minneapolis last week. While out, she and a friend reportedly ran into an ex-boyfriend at a bar 

'That kind of set off some emotions,' Laven told KSTP.

Laven told the television station she and Houle went to Blarney's Pub and Grill, where they wound up separated from one another. Laven told KSTP she hasn't seen Houle since.

Laven told KSTP 'Her purse and phone were found in the middle of the street near her apartment building, which is a few blocks down from Blarney's. So a lot of us think she may have tried to walk home from Blarney's.'

Minneapolis police posted on Twitter Saturday that Houle's purse was found at 3am on Friday. 

'Purse was located on the 1100 block of 4th St SE. No further info is available at this time,' a Saturday tweet from the police department said.

Police have said Houle was wearing a black leather jacket, black boots, along with a green blouse and black leggings. She is 5'5" and weighs 140 pounds, according to authorities. 

KSTP reported that police have spoken with an ex-boyfriend of Houle's and multiple other individuals.

According to the television station, Houle attends the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities and is a Phi Beta Phi sorority member.

The chapter's president, Madeline Eddy, said in a Saturday statement to WCCO 'Pi Beta Phi is fully cooperative and our main focus is finding Jen and supporting her family.'

University vice provost Danita Brown Young said in a Sunday statement to KSTP 'The University of Minnesota is working with local law enforcement to help find Jennifer Houle, a Carlson School of Management student and Pi Beta Phi sorority member, who has been missing since Friday, March 27.'

She said counseling is available for the University of Minnesota community.

Police wrote on Facebook that 'Anyone with any information about this case is asked to call 9-1-1 or send a text to 847 411 (tip 411), enter MPD and the tip or call the tipline at 612-692-TIPS (8477). All texts are anonymous.'
