The Society of Black Lawyers hit out at Tottenham and the Football Association after repeating its threat to go to the police over what it regards as anti-Semitic chanting at White Hart Lane.

Spurs fans sent an open message of defiance to the SBL on Thursday night when they chanted 'We'll sing what we want' and 'Yid Army' throughout the club's 3-1 home win over Maribor in the Europa League.

Despite being a club with a traditionally large Jewish following, Tottenham fans often refer to themselves as 'Yids' or the 'Yid Army' in chants during the club's matches.

'We'll sing what we want': Spurs fans were in defiant mood on Thursday

Although Spurs claim otherwise, the 
SBL say the phrase is anti-Semitic and they have vowed to complain to 
the police under the Public Order Act if supporters continue to use the 
chant beyond the November 20 deadline it has set.

The SBL had monitors at the north 
London ground on Thursday night who heard the chants and this morning it
reiterated its commitment to report any such action to the police 
should fans continue their actions.

'We are not going to let go on this,' SBL chair Peter Herbert said.

'After November 20 there is a potential that people will get a criminal conviction. If they want to run that risk then fine.

'We are serious. We aren't in this 
for sensationalism. We think the vast majority of Tottenham fans are 
sensible and do not engage in anti-Semitism.

'It's a very small minority who obviously don't care about any offence.

'Their love of football is greater than their desire to deal with anti-Semitism.'

Tottenham refused to comment on the 
matter. The London club stick by the statement they released on 
Wednesday which read: 'Our guiding principle in respect of the "Y-word" 
is based on the point of law itself - the distinguishing factor is the 
intent with which it is used ie if it is used with the deliberate 
intention to cause offence. This has been the basis of prosecutions of 
fans of other teams to date.

Flying the flag: Herbert has launched another attack on Tottenham supporters

'Our fans adopted the chant as a 
defence mechanism in order to own the term and thereby deflect 
anti-Semitic abuse. They do not use the term to others to cause any 
offence, they use it as a chant amongst themselves.'

Herbert believes the club have been 
misguided over the issue and claims fans can be prosecuted regardless of
whether the songs are intended to cause offence.

'Under Section Five of the Public 
Order Act it doesn't matter what the intent is of the individual or the 
crowd, if the words cause harassment, alarm, or distress to anyone 
watching then that is sufficient,' Herbert said.

Three and easy: Defoe scored a hat-trick in Tottenham's win on Thursday

'If a crowd of men were walking down 
Tottenham High Road singing the Y-word causing offence they would be 
arrested. It doesn't make sense that they can make White Hart Lane a 
no-go area for law.'

Herbert ridiculed Tottenham's 
statement and claimed the SBL has widespread support for its campaign 
from within the Jewish community.

'We have no doubt there will be complaints (to the police),' Herbert added.

'If the Met Police say they are going to look at prosecutions then there is a good chance it will stop.

'Tottenham's statement is 
indefensible. I think if you went to the United States, Canada or South 
Africa and you made a statement like that you would face ridicule and 
condemnation.

'It is a very sad day for English football when clubs feel they have to defend a term of abuse.'

Herbert also accused the FA of a lack of interest in the Tottenham matter.

'This is an appalling abdication of 
responsibility by the FA,' he said. 'It's a complete disgrace that they 
have stayed silent on this.

'There is an inertia from the FA over racism and anti-Semitism.

'You can't go and complain about racism and anti-Semitism in Serbia and then have it happening in your own back yard.'
