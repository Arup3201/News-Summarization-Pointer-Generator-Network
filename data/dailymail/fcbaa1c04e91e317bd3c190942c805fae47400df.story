Karen Gravano says her life has been ripped off by the makers of Grand Theft Auto V who created an animated character called Antonia Bottino who was based on her

In papers filed at Manhattan Supreme 
Court by her lawyer Thomas Farinella, it is claimed: 'Notwithstanding 
the fact that plaintiff has the utmost respect for the writers and 
creators of the Grand Theft Auto V video gameâ€¦ her story is unique and 
is hers to tell.'

In the game the Bottino is rescued by the game's main character after getting buried alive off a dirt road.

According to an online synopsis of GTA V, she then recounts how a murder charge was pinned on her father and how the family was forced to be 'moving around safe houses in rat-hole hick towns where no one comes looking'.

Her fictional father, former Gambetti family underboss Sammy (Sonny) Bottino, eventually became a snitch, acquiring many enemies.

In the game he refuses to allow her to participate in a TV show called Wise Bitches, which Gravano claims is similar to the VH1 show Mob Wives she stars in.

Sammy Bottino is widely believed to be based on Gravano's father, a Gambino underboss who became a turncoat, helping to bring down John Gotti.
