Real Madrid midfielder Luka Modric is set to miss the rest of the year with a thigh injury, the La Liga leaders confirmed on Monday.

Modric went off injured in the first half of Croatia's Euro 2016 qualifier in Italy on Sunday and team doctor Boris Nemec's initial fears that tendon damage would keep him on the sidelines for over a month have been confirmed by tests at his club.

'An examination by medical staff from Real Madrid have discovered a tear in a thigh tendon in his left leg,' Real said.

Modric has been a key figure in Real's bright start to the season that sees them top La Liga with 27 points from 11 games. 

The 29-year-old midfielder injured his thigh during a sprint and signalled to the bench that he could not play on in the feisty Euro 2016 qualifier in Milan.

Modric received medial attention on the pitch but had to be helped down the tunnel after being replaced by Inter Milan youngster Mateo Kovacic.

Modric will miss Real Madrid's game against Eibar on Sunday, as well as league games against Malaga and Celta Vigo before the Christmas break. 

Carlo Ancelotti's side also have games against Basle and Ludogorets in the Champions League.

The midfielder is unlikely to be back in action by the time Real travel to Morocco for the Club World Cup in December.

The Champions League holders will face either Cruz Azul or Western Sydney Wanderers in a semi-final on December 16 ahead of a potential final four days later.
