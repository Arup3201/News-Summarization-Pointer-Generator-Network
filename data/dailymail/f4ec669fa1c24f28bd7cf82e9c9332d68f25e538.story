Police caught a presumed dead Georgia banker this week in a routine traffic stop, after he went off the grid almost two years ago following a $20million fraud scheme.

Aubrey Lee Price, 47, made his first appearance in court today in Brunswick, Georgia after his arrest on Tuesday. He is being tried for one count of bank fraud and if found guilty could spend 30 years in prison and a $1,000,000 fine.

The FBI had been searching for Prince ever since June 2012 when he sent a suicide letter to his family, saying he planned to take a ferry to Key West and jump into the ocean to end his life.

Caught: Price, who will return to court for a bail hearing on Monday, allegedly faked his suicide to avoid charges

Price disappeared on June 16, 2012 after telling his family he was going to Guatemala on a business trip, authorities said.

Two days later, his family and acquaintances received letters from him detailing his plot to jump off the ferry.Â 

'My depression and discouragement have driven me to deep anxiety, fear and shame. I am emotionally overwhelmed and incapable of continuing in this life,' said a rambling confession letter investigators believe was written by Price.

'I created false statements, covered up my losses and deceived and hurt the very people I was trying to help,' the letter said.

It seemed that Price had following out the plan when credit card records showed he bought dive weights and a ferry ticket. Price was captured on surveillance footage at the Key West airport and ferry terminal the day he disappeared, and the ferry ticket was scanned at the boarding point.

Those letters prompted a U.S. Coast Guard search for Price, which caused $173,000.

More than a year ago, a Florida judge declared Price to be legally dead, but the FBI continued to search for him offering a reward of up to $20,000 for his capture.

The FBI turned out to be right when police in Glynn County, Georgia stopped him for a tinted window violation on Interstate 95.

Officers said that it was clear Price was giving them false information during the stop and they were soon able to determine that he was wanted by the FBI.

After his capture, Price told authorities that since disappearing he had been working as a migrant worker, accepting cash for odd jobs.

At his appearance in court today, Price sported long, unkempt hair and a straggly beard, a far cry from his neat, suited appearance two years ago.

Back then, Price was the director of Montgomery Bank & Trust in Ailey, Georgia.

In December 2010, when a company he controlled bought a controlling portion of the bank's stock, according to a complaint filed in June 2012 in federal court in New York.

Price then opened brokerage accounts through a securities clearing and custodial firm in New York and told bank managers he would invest in U.S. Treasury securities.

Instead of investing the bank's money, authorities say Price wired the funds into accounts he controlled at other financial institutions and provided bank managers with fraudulent documents.

Raid: Officials believe that Price raised $40million from more than 100 investors in Georgia and Florida through an unregistered investment 
fund that he managed

Price lived with his wife and 
children in Bradenton, Florida, but bought a home in Valdosta in the 
months before his disappearance, according to authorities. Price had 
moved his family to the south Georgia city, where his wife's parents 
lived, just a few weeks before he disappeared.

FBI Special Agent Stephen Emmett said that he didn't know whether Price's wife and children had known that he was still alive.

His family had previously told investigators they believed Price was dead.

At the court hearing today, prosecutors called Price 'a flight risk' and recommended no bail be set.

A bond hearing was set for Monday in Savannah.
