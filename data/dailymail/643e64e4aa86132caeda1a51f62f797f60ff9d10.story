A drug addict was today jailed for life for stabbing a pensioner to death in a late night knife attack on his own doorstep.

William Jones, 32, had been going door-to-door with a knife looking for his ex-girlfriend and her new partner.

Vulnerable charity shop volunteer Peter Lewis, 68, opened the door to his flat in Cardiff's Claude Road in the early hours of April last year and was confronted by an angry Jones.

Crime scene: Disabled Mr Lewis used his panic alarm button in his home in Roath, Cardiff, to alert the emergency services but died shortly after arriving at hospital

The partially sighted pensioner, who had learning difficulties, was stabbed once to the chest in the unprovoked fatal attack.

Jones, from Adamstown, Cardiff, south Wales, was jailed for life today and told he will serve a minimum of 22 years in prison before being considered for parole.

Judge Mr Justice John Griffiths Williams said: 'The contrast between your life and that of Peter Lewis could not be greater.

'At the age of 32 you were a drug addict, a man who had little or no regard for his fellow man.

'Peter Lewis was a calm and gentle man who, despite his disabilities, led a full life helping others where he could.

'There was no malice in him but those who knew him understood him. There were many who held him affectionately in their regard.

'His murder was a cruel end to an affectionate life.'

The court heard that after murdering the pensioner, Jones went out to a Cardiff nightclub to enjoy himself.

The judge told Jones: 'You are a selfish and unfeeling man who has shown no remorse whatsoever.'

Jones was found guilty of murder last Friday by a jury at Cardiff Crown Court, where he was sentenced today.

In his defence he had insisted the pensioner opened the door wielding a kitchen knife and he had inadvertently stabbed him trying to grab it away.

He then made off on foot with the kitchen knife, disposing of it along the way.

But the jury last week took less than three hours to reject Jones's version of events.

The unprovoked killing was described as an 'appalling attack' by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).

'Peter Lewis was a vulnerable man who posed no threat to anyone, least of all William Jones,' senior crown prosecutor Paul Hewitt said.

'His murder was an appalling attack, carried out by a killer who has taken no responsibility for his actions, instead seeking to suggest that he himself was the one being attacked.

'Thankfully, this trial has exposed his deceit.'

Mr Lewis had made a desperate plea for help as he lay dying at his home in Roath, Cardiff, Mr Hewitt added, saying the 68-year-old was 'bleeding terribly'.

The jury heard a recording which was made through an emergency panic alarm the pensioner wore around his neck.

Despite quickly arriving on the scene, police found Mr Lewis lying pale and in shock with a single puncture wound in his chest.

He was taken to the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, but despite all efforts to save him he died 15 minutes after arriving.
