Wayne Rooney was among the raft of famous faces to publicly back a Christmas charity campaign in aid of Alder Hey Children’s Hospital.

The England captain was one of a cluster to have modelled a new range of ‘alphabet scarves’ – sold by Matalan – with proceeds going to the Merseyside medical facility.

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers and Everton fan Amanda Holden were also snapped wearing the garments, as well as David Haye.

David Haye and Danny Cipriani were also part of the wide-reaching campaign. 

The Alphabet Scarves, which have also been modelled by the likes of Helen Mirren, Rod Stewart, Tinie Tempah and Bruce Forsyth, are on sale in Matalan stores across the UK and online at www.Matalan.co.uk priced at £10 and £5 for children.

One hundred per cent of the profits will go straight to Alder Hey.
