He may be injured at the moment, but Robin van Persie saw the bright side of being unable to play as he took advantage of a free Saturday night to head out in Manchester.

The Dutch striker was seen strolling the streets of the city, before heading to a nightclub called LIV in the city centre - which admittedly may not be the best-named club for a Red Devils striker to be attending.

It is a bar where a bottle of champagne can cost as much as £700, but you can still pick up a cocktail for less than a tenner - a more than reasonable price for a man on a Premier League  wage.

Unsurprisingly, Van Persie wasn't joined by any of his team-mates, with Manchester United facing a huge game against Tottenham on Sunday.

The 31-year-old has been in indifferent form this season, and hasn't played since getting injured in February's 2-1 defeat at Swansea. 

His boss Louis van Gaal, meanwhile, has been reluctant to earmark a date for his return.

'He [Van Persie] is still with the medical department and needs to take the step to the technical department,' said Van Gaal.

'He is always training but the medical department is also sports science so he is training inside, not outside on the pitch. Even when he is on the pitch, he is with the medical department.

'He will then take the step to the technical department and then we have a process when he comes into our selection and trains.'
