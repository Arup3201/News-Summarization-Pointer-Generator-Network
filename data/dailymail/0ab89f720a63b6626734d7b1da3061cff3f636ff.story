Archaeologists have discovered an 'epic' new fossil site they could change what we know about animal evolution.

The secret site is revealing fossils at an 'astonishing' rate, researchers say.

They claim it will significantly increase our understanding of animals in the Cambrian period.

Yoho National Park's 505-million-year-old Burgess Shale – home to some of the planet's earliest animals, including a very primitive human relative – is one of the world's most important fossil sites.

This new finding is the latest in a recent string of Burgess Shale discoveries, including confirmation that Pikaia, found only in Yoho National Park, is the most primitive known vertebrate and therefore the ancestor of all descendant vertebrates, including humans.

Now, more than a century after its discovery, a compelling sequel has been unearthed: 42 kilometres away in Kootenay National Park, a new Burgess Shale fossil site has been located that appears to equal the importance of the original discovery, and may one day even surpass it.

Approximately 200 animal species had been identified at the original Yoho site in over 600 field days.

In just 15 days of field collecting, 50 animal species have already been unearthed at the new site.

The site, discovered in the summer of 2012 by an international research team led by University of Toronto ecology and evolutionary biologist Jean-Bernard Caron, is described in a paper released today in Nature Communications.

'This is an epic new chapter in a research story that began more than 100 years ago and there is no doubt in my mind that this new material will significantly increase our understanding of early animal evolution,' said Caron.

'The rate at which we are finding animals — many of which are new — is astonishing, and there is a significant possibility that we’ll eventually find more species here than at the original Yoho site, and potentially more than from anywhere else in the world.'

Protected by Parks Canada, the exact location of the new site remains confidential to protect its integrity - though future visitor opportunities have not been ruled out.

'We were already aware of the presence of some Burgess Shale fossils in Kootenay National Park,' said research team member Robert Gaines of Pomona College.

'We had a hunch that if we followed the formation along the mountain topography into new areas with the right rock types, maybe, just maybe, we would get lucky – though we never in our wildest dreams thought we’d track down a motherlode like this.

'It didn’t take us very long at all to realize that we had dug up something special.

'To me, the Burgess Shale is a grand tale in every way imaginable, and we are incredibly proud to be part of this new chapter and to keep the story alive and thriving in everyone’s imagination.'

Some species found at the new Kootenay site are also found in China's famous Chengjiang fossil beds, which are 10 million years older.

This contributes to the pool of evidence suggesting that the local and worldwide distribution of Cambrian animals, as well as their longevity, might have been underestimated.

'We know that we have barely scratched the site and nonetheless found at least 12 new species to describe,' said Cédric Aria, a PhD student in U of T's Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.

'What awaits us there, only the mountain knows, but chances are high that the discoveries will fuel a lot more research.

'The full potential of these new fossil beds has yet to be revealed.'

Approximately 200 animal species had been identified at the original Yoho site in over 600 field days. In just 15 days of field collecting, 50 animal species have already been unearthed at the new Kootenay site.

The Cambrian explosion, or Cambrian radiation, was the relatively rapid appearance, around 530million years ago, of most major animal phyla, as demonstrated in the fossil record.

Before about 580million years ago, most organisms were simple, composed of individual cells occasionally organized into colonies.

Over the following 70 or 80million years, the rate of evolution accelerated by an order of magnitude (as defined in terms of the extinction and origination rate of species) and the diversity of life began to resemble that of today.

It ended with the Cambrian–Ordovician extinction event, approximately 488million years ago.

A paper published today in the prestigious scientific journal Nature Communications describes Kootenay National Park's new 'Marble Canyon' fossil beds for the first time.

The authors suggest that the area and its extraordinary fossils will greatly further our understanding of the sudden explosion of animal life during the Cambrian Period.
