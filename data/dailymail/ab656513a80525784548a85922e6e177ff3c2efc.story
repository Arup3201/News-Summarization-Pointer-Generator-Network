Controversy: David Cameron's proposals were condemned by motoring groups as 'a toll too far'

Controversial plans to privatise roads and create ‘Lexus lanes’ that would allow the wealthiest  drivers to bypass traffic jams were met with anger last night.

Motoring and transport groups condemned David Cameron’s pay-to-drive proposals as ‘ludicrous’ and ‘a toll too far’.

Under the plans, tolls could be introduced on new highways and existing roads could be widened to create additional lanes that drivers could use to get around congestion – at a cost.

The AA warned the Government was creating ‘a poll tax on wheels’ while Labour complained of a ‘rip-off’.

Haulage firms said it was ‘unthinkable’ to introduce tolls at a time when motorists and firms were being crippled with record fuel prices and the highest levels of fuel tax in Europe.

Ministers have ruled out a comprehensive national network of road tolls, but only until the end of this Parliament in 2015. The row erupted after the Prime Minister said yesterday he was proposing a ‘radical’ plan to kick-start the economy by allowing private firms and investment funds to compete to build, operate and maintain motorways and trunk roads in England and Wales.

Under the plans, motorists will not pay tolls to use existing roads. But firms given long-term leases on sections of motorway or dual carriageway could widen them to create additional pay-as-you-go lanes that drivers could use to beat congestion.  

These are nicknamed ‘Lexus lanes’ in the U.S. because only those wealthy enough to drive luxury cars can afford to use them.

Mr Cameron, who used to drive a Lexus, is now chauffeured in an official Jaguar XJ limousine.

New roads constructed from scratch would operate like French toll roads, much like the existing system on the M6 Toll through the Midlands from Birmingham to Stafford.

Motoring groups said Britain’s 33million drivers were fed up with being ‘fleeced’ and simply don’t trust ministers to live up to their promises.

They fear drivers will be priced off the roads by profiteering companies, as has happened with privatised train companies. The Treasury raises more than £48billion a year from motorists in the form of duty and VAT on fuel, vehicle excise duty, VAT on car sales and company car tax – but less than £10billion of this is spent on the roads.

Private operators who took over the running of existing roads would receive a share of the near £6billion raised each year from road tax according to how many vehicles used the roads.

In his speech to the Institution of Civil Engineers, Mr Cameron said there was an ‘urgent’ need for private sector funds because the Government cannot afford to address growing gridlock and pothole problems.

But AA president Edmund King warned: ‘The privatisation of the railway network has hardly been a spectacular success and millions of drivers will be concerned if one of our most important and used national assets, the strategic road network, is sold off.

‘Many drivers would suspect new ownership is the thin end of the wedge leading to national road pricing. New charges would be a toll too far.’

Neil Greig, of the Institute of Advanced Motorists, said: ‘British drivers simply don’t trust the Government to come up with a new way of paying for roads that will not lead to increased costs in the long run. Drivers already pay far more in taxes and duties than they get back in investment in new roads.’

Geoff Dunning, chief executive of the Road Haulage Association, said tolls on new roads were ‘quite unthinkable’ and ‘ludicrous’ at a time of record fuel prices hitting motorists and hauliers.

Labour’s transport spokesman Maria Eagle said motorists face ‘a rip-off’ adding: ‘The Prime Minister’s double-speak gives the impression that his privatisation plans will only see tolls applied to new roads.

‘Yet he has redefined new roads to include anything that adds capacity including road widening and junction improvements. Motorists will rightly consider that to be a clear plan for charging for existing roads.’

But Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, gave a ‘cautious welcome’ to the idea of private sector investment to tackle the ‘chronic levels of traffic and congestion’.
