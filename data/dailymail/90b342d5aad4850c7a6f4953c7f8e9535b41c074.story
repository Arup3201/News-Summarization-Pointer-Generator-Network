Friends have taken to Facebook to pay tribute to Josh Furber who fell to his death after slipping on rocks near a waterfall

A student who fell to his death after slipping on rocks near a waterfall in Australia had told how he was ‘living out my dreams’ during the trip.

Josh Furber, 20, plunged 300ft over a cliff in the Blue Mountains moments after a witness described seeing a group of holidaymakers ‘mucking around’ close to the edge.

As police climbers recovered his body yesterday, family and friends paid tribute to the university undergraduate, who is understood to have been four months into a year-long adventure.

Last month Mr Furber, from Runcorn, Cheshire, posted on Facebook: ‘This is the best experience of my life and I can honestly say I am living out my dreams.’

New South Wales police said Mr Furber had travelled with friends from Sydney, where he was working as a barman at Bondi Beach.

Another visitor, Rosa Petroccitto, claimed the group were ‘skylarking’ and she feared ‘something terrible’ was going to happen.

'I saw a group of French and English kids - you know, adults - mucking around on the rocks and it's very slippery.

'Then they went down to the next one (group of rocks) and I knew something was going to happen.

'We just saw them all panic and a 20-year-old boy fell over 100m down the waterfall.'

‘I saw a group … mucking around on the rocks and it’s very slippery,’ she said.

Mr Furber was studying construction management at Leeds Metropolitan University.

Tragic: The body of a British tourist has been recovered by rescuers after he apparently slipped and fell to his death while with friends in Australia's Blue Mountains, close to Wentworth Falls, pictured

Expert police climbers using abseiling equipment and assisted by a helicopter yesterday recovered his body in what they said was a tricky operation, 24 hours after he slipped from the rocks.

His parents, Mark and Jayne, were too upset to comment at their semi-detached home in Runcorn, Cheshire last night.

His aunt said: 'Everyone is in pieces. We 
are all just so heartbroken.'

Family friend Maria Ellis posted on 
Facebook: 'Words can't explain how much we are all missing you back 
home! You was such amazing lad with big ambitions and had so much more 
to achieve.

Tragic: The young man was said to have fallen down the waterfall. His was recovered this morning

'Everyone who knew you known how much of a nice lad you were, nobody could of had anything bad to say about you.

'You loved life and pursued your dreams. You will never be forgotten and you're an inspiration to me and the rest of your friends and family.

'I still can't believe it. Gone far too soon.' College friend Myles McKeever, posted: 'He was an inspiration mate, did what most people in Runcorn can only dream about.'

Jord Blackburn, replied: 'He'll do more than what I'll do in a lifetime and many others.'

With their distinctive blue-tinged views, the Blue Mountains are popular with tourists for their bush-walking opportunities and spectacular valleys and waterfalls.

Picturesque: A popular destination for hikers and holidaymakers, the Blue Mountains in New South Wales are so named because of the blue hue over the region's forested valleys caused by vaporising eucalyptus oil

But Australian police and forest rangers warned that the area's steep drops, slippery rocks and thick bushland should always be treated with respect - and warning signs should be adhered to.

In a letter to a local newspaper, Christopher Woods wrote: 'For the death, don't blame anyone but the ones involved.

'It's not the fault of National Parks or anyone else.

'There are signs on the fence they had to climb over. I walk there often and my warnings to similar fools are always ignored.'
