Wearing designer couture and with all eyes on them, it is a place where models are supposed to feel at their best.

But these Japanese men looked far from impressed as they strutted their stuff on a catwalk at Tokyo Fashion Week today.

The models took centre stage in a range of bizarre wigs - from highly coiffed hairstyles to makeshift helmets.

One man appeared to gaze at the crowd in dismay as he walked down the catwalk in a colourful, knitted jacket and an enormous blonde wig.

The striking headwear, featuring a long trail of hair at the back, seemed to bear more resemblance to a centurion helmet than the sleek, perfect locks typical of models.

Another did not look impressed with his attire as he stared out from under a helmet of highly coiffed hair with a forlorn expression and a furrowed brow.

And even a jazzy suit could not cheer one man up - whose ginger-coloured wig attracted much more attention than his matching moustache and beard.

Unusual attire: The fashion week, which is held in Tokyo twice a year, is renowned for its alternative fashions

The unusual wigs, created for Japanese designer Yoshio Kubo's collection, were captured on camera at the Mercedes-Benz fashion week, which is being held in Japan's capital until this evening.

The fashion week, which takes place twice a year, is renowned world over for its alternative fashions that see women dressed in haute goth and men don eccentric, feminine hairstyles.

This year's event has showcased the creations of numerous designers and brands, including Kidill, NÃ©-net, Ariunaa Suri, Sretsis, NurZahra, Afriqan Apeiron, Dresscamp and Major Minor.
