Bill O'Reilly showed footage shot by CBS during the Falklands conflict as Fox News continued their defense of the veteran broadcaster.

During his Monday night show, The O'Reilly Factor, he played clips of police roaming the streets of Buenos Aires in 1982, using tear gas and firing rubber bullets during protests which he claims led to one of his photographers being injured.

The 65-year-old also interviewed NBC New's former Miami bureau chief Don Browne, who was responsible for the network's coverage in the region. 

The former journalist backed up claims the Argentine capital was a dangerous place for reporters and 'wasn't a joke'.

His support comes as O'Reilly continues to vehemently deny claims he embellished stories of what was going on in the South American country at the time.

The station's retaliation was prompted by a Mother Jones article last week calling into question O'Reilly's claims he reported in a 'war zone' or 'combat zone' during the brief conflict between Britain and Argentina.

Retaliation: Bill O'Reilly showed footage shot by CBS during the Falklands conflict as Fox News continued their defense of the veteran broadcaster 

In the archive footage, none of the stories mentions O'Reilly, then a young CBS reporter, or makes any specific reference to a crew member being hurt.

Few reporters made it to the front of the war, some 1,000 miles from the Argentine capital of Buenos Aires.

O'Reilly has said that he covered an anti-government demonstration in Buenos Aires that turned violent and that a photographer he was working with was knocked to the ground and was bleeding. 

Describing the events two years ago, O'Reilly said he 'dragged off' the photographer from danger.

Former CBS News correspondent Eric Engberg, who also was covering the event, characterized O'Reilly's account as 'dishonest' and 'completely nutty' during a Huffington Post interview on Monday. Engberg said none of the camera operators working the night in question remembers any colleague being injured. The camera person who was said to be hurt has not spoken publicly about the matter.

During one of the CBS reports, then-anchor Dan Rather said that several television crew members were knocked to the ground and that North American television crews were 'jostled.'

An Engberg report, also released by CBS on Monday, said police fired guns with tear gas and plastic bullets. He said in the report it was unknown how many people were hurt but at least some were seriously injured.

Controversy: The voice of Eric Engberg was heard in one of the clips showing police in the streets of Buenos Aires. He openly criticized O'Reilly's claims in a Facebook post over the weekend 

An Associated Press account of the demonstration said that police officers charged a group of about 50 journalists, beating some and trampling others.

'Two news photographers were reported injured by rubber bullets fired by police,' said the June 16, 1982, account by AP writer Douglas Grant Mine.

The release of the videos, while providing more detail about the situation O'Reilly faced 33 years ago, did not resolve the issue of whether his retellings of the experience have been completely factual.

In addition to his work at Fox, O'Reilly has become a force in the publishing industry with a series of books on the deaths of historical figures like Abraham Lincoln and Jesus Christ.

O'Reilly, on his program Monday night, showed portions of the CBS video and said it proved the event was no 'walk in the park.'  

Browne said the situation 'got progressively more intense' and there were demonstrations in Buenos Aires every day.

He said: 'I was surprised at the article because interesting enough you [O'Reilly] came on my radar. I was overseeing the coverage in El Salvador, it was a brutal war and you were there to cover the war. 

'It was an opportunity for young journalists to get their ticket punched. And that was the time when satellite news was on and it was the number one news story at the time.

Support: O'Reilly also interviewed NBC New's former Miami bureau chief Don Browne, who was responsible for the network's coverage in the region.

Describing the escalation of violence in Buenos Aires, he said: 'Let me give you the progression of the war. It was a joke, at first nobody took it seriously. We had the only reporter that actually got on the Falkland Islands. Robin Lloyd actually got on there through the Argentine Navy.

'At first it was casual, and then it became more and more serious and as the military were losing badly, the populous began to turn on the military leadership.

'There were tanks on the streets of Buenos Aries. It was a real country at war. It wasn't a joke. It was a real war and they were taking it very seriously.

He said the city was a good place to be if you were covering the war, but it progressively got more and more intense as it went on.

'These were veteran correspondents, we saw the situation escalating, they weren't surprised. But they were surprised at the over-reaction. 

'To them it was business as usual. It didn't happen over one day. You call it a riot, it was a very intense situation where people got hurt and there was a very serious confrontation and it was a defining moment when the populous turned on the military.'

'He agreed that it was a violent and volatile situation where reporters were in danger.

The Mother Jones piece was printed shortly after NBC News anchor Brian Williams was suspended for misrepresenting his experiences in the Iraq War. O'Reilly, long the most popular prime-time figure in cable news, has called the piece a political hit job.

'I want to stop this now,' O'Reilly said. 'I hope we can stop it, I really do.'

Fox News CEO Roger Ailes has said he fully supports O'Reilly.
