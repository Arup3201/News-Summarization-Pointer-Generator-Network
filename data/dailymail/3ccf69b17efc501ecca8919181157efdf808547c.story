Ashley Long, 14, died from after suffering an embolism from the pressurized tank depriving her brain of oxygen

The family of a teenager who died from inhaling helium at a party have said their daughter only used it because of 'peer pressure.'

Ashley Long, 14, died from after suffering an embolism from the pressurized tank depriving her brain of oxygen.

The craze of inhaling helium is a party trick spreading across the U.S, with users getting a comical high-pitched voice after inhalation, although it does not hold any 'high' effect.

But the teen's tragic death in what her friends thought was light-heartened fun, exposes the dangers of inhaling or 'huffing' helium, especially from a pressurized tank.

Ms Long had told her parents she was going to a slumber party last Saturday, but she actually went to a condo in Medford, Oregon, where police say the older sister of one of her friends was throwing a party with alcohol and marijuana.

After drinking on the drive, and downing more drinks in the condo, Ashley took a turn on a tank of helium that everyone else was inhaling to make their voices sound funny.

'That helium tank got going around,' 
said Ashley's stepfather, Justin Earp, who learned what happened from 
talking to Ashley's friends at the party.

'It
 got to my daughter. My daughter didn't want to do it. It was peer 
pressure. They put a mask up to her face. They said it would be OK. 
"It's not gonna hurt you. It'll just make you laugh and talk funny."

Instead,
 she collapsed out and later died at a hospital, the result of an 
obstruction in a blood vessel caused by inhaling helium from a 
pressurized tank.

Ashley's best friend Marina Zamora 
said that she had never used drugs and had not drunk before and the 
party was the first time she consumed alcohol.

'I think she felt I think she felt 
like she was going to let us down if she didn't do it as this guys was 
holding it up to her mouth, telling her to do it,' said Miss Zamora.

going to a slumber party last Saturday, but she actually went to a condo
 in Medford, Oregon, where she collapsed and never regain consciousness

She performed CPR on her best friend while others called 911, but Miss Long did not respond.

Miss Zamora said the young man who pressured Miss Long left when he heard others call police.

Police have arrested 27-year-old 
Katherine McAloon, who lived in the condo, on charges of providing 
alcohol and marijuana to minors.

Justin Earp said the kids had four wine
 coolers each in the car, and four mixed drinks at the condo, before 
they started passing around the helium.

Police
 said it was an 8-gallon canister, which is availability at many stores 
and the kids were taking hits directly from the tank.

'About 11.30 we got a phone call from police saying they were doing CPR on our daughter,' said Justin Earp.

At the hospital, they were told that Ashley had died.

Loriann Earp said she feels like her daughter was stolen from her.

'My whole chest is collapsed and my heart is broken,' she said through sobs.

'I don't understand.'

She says her daughter was a goofy, nerdy eighth-grader 
who struggled with her weight, was just starting to notice boys, got top
 grades in school, had posters of Justin Bieber all over her room and 
wanted to grow up to be a marine biologist.

The family moved from Grants Pass, 
Oregon, to Eagle Point about a year ago, and Ashley had just gotten over
 the difficulty of adjusting to eighth grade in a new school.

Dr.
 Mark Morocco, associate professor of emergency medicine at the Ronald 
Reagan Medical Center in Los Angeles, said what happens is similar to 
when a scuba diver surfaces too quickly.

A gas bubble gets into the 
bloodstream, perhaps through some kind of tear in a blood vessel, and 
can block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.

Death from inhaling helium is so rare 
that the American Association Poison Control Centers lumps it in with 
other gases, such as methane and propane.

Only three deaths were 
recorded in 2010, said spokeswoman Loreeta Canton.

But police say huffing is a growing trend across the country.

Officials are worried that when the tanks are on shelves with few or no limitations, choosing between proper use and abuse is at the buyer's hands.

Doctors have said 'huffing' helium can have potentially catastrophic effects on the person who abuses it, cutting off oxygen in the body, essentially causing strangulation.

And inhaling the pressurized air straight from the nozzle of a tank can also cause direct damage to the lung or separate it from the lining outside of the lung so it can't move normally, as well as causing a gas bubble in Ms Long's case.Â 

The gas is also commonly seen in suicide 
kits - mail-order hoods sold out of Oregon and elsewhere that can be 
attached to a helium tank by people who want to kill themselves. In 
those cases, the helium crowds out the oxygen, asphyxiating a person.

It's important to remind kids that ingesting any substance - for the sake of getting high or just changing their voices - can be dangerous, said Frank Pegueros, executive director of DARE, Drug Abuse Resistance Education.

Mr Pegueros said the first defense is for parents to tell their kids about the dangers of certain substances. He said kids need to also ask themselves whether going along with the crowd at a party is worth it.

'Peer pressure is a very potent force,' he said.

'We've all gone through it growing up. It's getting somebody to pause and think and evaluate the situation and determine, is this something that's going to have a bad consequence.'

Four men who were at the party have been questioned by police, but have not been charged, said Medford Police Lt Mike Budreau.

More charges may be filed after police turn over their evidence to the district attorney.

Her family has set up a foundation, Ashley's Hope, to spread the word about the dangers of inhaling helium.
