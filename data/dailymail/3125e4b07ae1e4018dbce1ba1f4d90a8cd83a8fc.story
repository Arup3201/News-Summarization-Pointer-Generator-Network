Cate Blanchett, Amy Adams and Meryl Streep led mourners from the acting world at Philip Seymour Hoffman's wake on Thursday.

The sombre actresses arrived at the Frank E. Campbell funeral home in Manhattan where they joined Hoffman's estranged partner of 14 years Mimi O'Donnell and the couple's three children Cooper, 10, Tallulah, seven, and Willa, five.

Cate, 44, clutched her husband Andrew Upton's hand and looked down as she made her way into the home.

While composed on the way in, the Australian star lent heavily on her husband for support as they left.

While clearly trying to be strong for her late friend, the actress looked near tears as she clutched a program from the memorial.

Cate was particular close to the late actor and her loss was written all over her face.

The heartbroken Cate recently cancelled interviews on both Good Morning America and Live! With Kelly And Michael.

Her
 representatives told The Hollywood Reporter the time out will 'allow 
Cate the time and privacy to grieve for the loss of her friend.'

On Monday, the Blue Jasmine actress paid 
her respects to the family of the late actor as she arrived with toys 
at the West Village, Manhattan home Hoffman shared until recently with Miss O'Donnell and their young children.

Worked closely together: Meryl Streep also paid her last respects to her former co-star and obviously deeply upset tried to discreetly leave the funereal home

The
 two Oscar winners first worked together in the 1999 psychological 
thriller The Talented Mr. Ripley, and Hoffman directed a play back in 
2010 for the Sydney Theatre Company, where Blanchett and Upton were 
artistic directors.

Meryl Streep also paid her last respects to her former co-star and obviously deeply upset tried to discreetly leave the funereal home.

The actress - who pulled her jacket up and covering her face - has worked alongside Hoffman a number of times both on stage in Anton Chekhov‘s The Seagull and in the 2008 movie Doubt.

Arrivals: Amy Adams and her partner Darren Le Gallo looked downcast as they arrived to pay their respects

Remembering her co-star: Adams starred with Hoffman and Joaquin Phoenix in The Master

Amy Adams, who co-starred alongside 
Hoffman in 2008 film Doubt and 2012 movie The Master arrived wearing 
dark sunglasses and a black coat with grey scarf.

She too was supported by her husband Darren Le Gallo, who walked quietly by her side.

Joaquin Phoenix, Ben Stiller and Justin Theroux joined the actresses in mourning for Hoffman who died of a suspected drug overdose last Sunday. Actors Ellen Burstyn, Billy Crudup and Josh 
Hamilton also attended.

Neither Adams nor Williams, who both 
starred in films with Hoffman, said anything as they entered the 
building. Williams's former partner, actor Heath Ledger, died of an 
accidental drug overdose in 2008.

Williams appeared alongside Hoffman in Charlie Kaufman 2008 film Synecdoche, New York and arrived wearing a black knitted beanie hat pulled around her ears and a pair of glasses.

Screenwriter David Bar Katz, Hoffman's close friend and the man who found his body, arrived with his son for support.

Although the body of Hoffman, 46, was 
found on Sunday in his Greenwich Village apartment with a syringe in his
 arm, autopsy results to determine the cause of his death were 
inconclusive. A spokeswoman for New York City's Chief Medical Examiner 
said further studies were being done

Four people have been arrested and charged with drug offences possibly connected to substances found at the actor's home.

O'Donnell - Hoffman's
 partner of 14 years - left the West Village home they once shared for the
 only the third time since his death to join family and close friends 
from the acting and entertainment world at the funeral
 home to mourn the Oscar-winner's tragic passing.

Hoffman's mother, Marilyn O'Connor,
 entered the funeral home soon after.

Hoffman, who was discovered on the 
floor of his bathroom on Sunday by his friend David Bar Katz, had been 
battling a relapse into drug and alcohol addiction for the best part of a
 year after being sober for more than 20.

The
 star of The Hunger Games and Capote reportedly fell off the wagon 
during the wrap party for his 2012 movie, The Master and entered rehab 
in May of last year.

Hoffman,
 an Academy Award winner for his role in the 2005 biographical film 
Capote, was considered one of the most gifted stage and film actors of 
his generation.

On Wednesday evening hundreds of friends and fans
 paid homage to him during a sombre candlelight vigil outside the 
Labyrinth Theatre Company in Greenwich Village.

Hoffman had been a
 member and a former artistic director of the New York company, which is
 one of the nation's leading ensemble theatre groups.

Broadway 
also honoured the actor when it dimmed marquees for a minute on Wednesday
 evening. Although Hoffman is best known for his film roles, he appeared
 on stage frequently.

He earned Tony award nominations for his role as 
Willy Loman in Death of a Salesman, and for his parts in Long Day's 
Journey Into Night and True West.

On the big screen Hoffman 
appeared in blockbusters such as The Hunger Games series and also 
garnered best supporting actor Oscar nominations for The Master, Doubt and Charlie Wilson's War.

Hoffman, 46, who was widely respected
 as one of the best actors of his generation, was found with around 70 
bags of heroin inside his apartment on Sunday after O'Donnell phoned his 
friend Katz to check on him after he failed to collect their children at
 9am.

Thursday's wake was the first farewell to the troubled stage and film actor. His funeral
 is due to take place on Friday at St. Ignatius of Loyola, near to the 
funeral parlor. A memorial is planned for later this month.
