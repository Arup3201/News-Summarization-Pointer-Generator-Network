The Hollywood gym inside which Manny Pacquiao plots his victory over Floyd Mayweather Jnr is being patrolled by seven armed guards.

The Wild Card Boxing Club, run by the Filipino’s esteemed trainer Freddie Roach, is usually open for fans hoping to catch a glimpse of a master at work.

But now, with a $300million (£200m) mega-fight at stake, nothing is being left to chance.

The famous Hollywood gym is being patrolled by seven armed guards ahead of the May 2 fight 

Freddie Roach (right, pictured in November) insisted on the guards having guns so that ‘people respect them’

Roach told the Associated Press that he insisted on the guards having guns so that ‘people respect them’ but the man himself will not be there to look after his charge until Sunday. 

The veteran trainer is in Macau preparing for Zou Shimming’s first world title fight on Saturday before returning to Los Angeles where Pacquiao, now 36, will spar 90 to 95 rounds instead of the usual 150.

They will both make the short trip downtown on Wednesday where they will be met by Mayweather for the only face-to-face meeting before fight week in Las Vegas.

And Roach wasted little time in taking a swipe at Mayweather’s father and trainer Floyd Snr.

Pacquiao uploaded an Instagram post on Thursday undergoing some shadow boxing

‘Going against Floyd Snr is a little disappointing,’ Roach said. ‘He just isn’t very good, especially during the fight itself. One of our advantages is having him in the other corner.’

Roach also underlined his complete confidence in Pacquiao ending Mayweather’s unbeaten record. 

‘Floyd is so disrespectful,’ he said. ‘Manny is the perfect role model for this fight and Mayweather is not. I told Manny we’ve got to beat him for the whole world. There’s no way we can’t win this fight.

Mayweather began training in his Las Vegas gym exactly two months before fighting Pacquiao

‘Floyd’s legs don’t move like they once did. He’s very clever but the fight is so big he may feel like he has to take a risk and exchange with us.

‘If he does that, that’s the best thing in the world for Manny in my mind.

‘Manny will be performing a public service for boxing when he beats Floyd.’

Pacquiao has been training in Roach’s absence and posted several videos on Instagram of his shadow boxing sessions.

And despite showing off his blistering hand speed, he wrote: ‘I feel slow but I’m not worried because I still have a lot of time.’
