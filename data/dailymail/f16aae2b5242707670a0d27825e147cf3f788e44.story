Russia's richest men have watched helplessly over the past 48 hours as vast sums of their wealth have evaporated thanks to their crumbling economy.

Alisher Usmanov, a steel magnate who owns a third of Arsenal football club, and Roman Abramovich, an oil tycoon who owns rival Chelsea, have lost more than £800million between them.

Sergey Galitsky, who owns Russia's largest supermarket chain, was the biggest loser, seeing £900million disappear in two days as the value of the Russian rouble tumbled.

The collapse of Russia's currency, which began two days ago after an interest rate hike lead to panic among investors, also threatens Russia's stranglehold on the top of the Rich List.

Mr Usmanov, who once topped the Sunday Times list, could drop from second to ninth in the table, leaving not a single Russian in the top five, compared with 2013 when there were two.

Mr Abramovich, meanwhile, could drop from number nine to number 11, behind the Duke of Westminster, unless the rouble recovers in the coming days.

On Tuesday the currency lost 20 per cent of its value in just a few hours, dropping to an all-time low of almost 80 roubles per dollar.

Yesterday the value rose and fell sharply, causing Apple to suspend online sales and forcing shops to announce sharp price rises, leading to panic buying.

Today the rouble is trading at 61 to the dollar, according to Xe.com, meaning it has gained back a lot of ground but is still below the historic low of 60 which caused the initial panic.

Despite the huge drops in wealth most Russian billionaires have seen in the last few days, two men have managed to buck the trend, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaires index.

Vladmir Potanin, who made his fortune selling shares in public assets after the fall of the Soviet Union, managed to make £117million, leaving him with an estimated fortune of £7.6billion.

Meanwhile financial manager Andrey Melnichenko raked in £32million while most of his fellow countrymen lost out.

In total the 15 richest Russians, who control £98.6billion between them, lost £5.5billion in just 48 hours as Russia's economy tumbled causing the largest crisis of Vladimir Putin's leadership.

President Putin is due to give his annual end-of-year address later today, which last year lasted for four hours.

However the timing could hardly be worse this year and is likely to be completely overshadowed by Russia's economic woes.

The country's finances have been left in a poor state largely due to a fall in the price of crude oil as Saudi Arabia has flooded the marketplace with reserves, driving value down. 

Economic sanctions from Europe and the U.S. over the situation in Ukraine have not helped, with Obama due to sign legislation passing new measures in the coming days.
