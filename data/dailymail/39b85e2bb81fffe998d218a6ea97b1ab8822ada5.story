Australian television legend Brian Henderson has spoken candidly about his struggle with cancer, after the disease returned this year for the fourth time.

The 83-year-old Gold Logie winner and former news presenter said that he was determined to beat the cancer, and was remaining optimistic about his prognosis.

'This is my fourth cancer stoush, so I'm beginning to feel I've endured more than my fair share,' said Mr Henderson.

'I've survived battles with bowel, prostate, and skin cancer, this time around it's throat cancer,' he told New Idea.

After visiting a specialist in October, Mr Henderson was given the news, and said that although he is about to start treatment, he won't have to undergo surgery.

'I will be halfway through my treatment by Christmas, so I hope I'll we well enough to enjoy Mardi's Christmas feast,' he said. 

New Zealand born Mr Henderson has two children from his first marriage, and two children, Nicole, 45, and Jody, 43, with his second wife Mardi, to whom he has been married for nearly 50 years. 

'Brian was my first real love...It's been 28 years of wedded bliss. We are also best friends- always have been,' Mardi said

The couple met when Mardi was only 16, and Brian was 33, and her parents forbid them to marry until she had turned 18.

'Brian was my first real love...It's been 28 years of wedded bliss. We are also best friends- always have been,' Mardi said.

The Australian television icon said that it is his love for his family which gives him strength and perspective in the face of another long battle.

'I'm enjoying life way too much to let another bout of cancer spoil things. I've been very lucky and feel blessed to be surrounded by such a beautiful and loving family,' Mr Henderson. 

Mr Henderson is currently Australia's longest serving newsreader, arriving in the country in 1953 to work as a DJ, before working for Channel 9 between 1957 and 2002.

He also hosted the wildly popular Australian version of music show Bandstand between 1958 and 1972, which launched now iconic stars such as Peter Allen and the Bee Gees.

'I must admit, back in those days, time were wild. Definitely too much fun, maybe a little too much carousing, gambling and drinking,' Mr Henderson told New Idea. 

'But that was the era. Then I met Mardi, who became my second wife. She settled me down and I woke up to myself,' he said. 

Mardi said that when the couple were on their honeymoon, at the height of Bandstand's popularity, a female fan accosted Mr Henderson in her excitement.

'Brian has always possessed an incredible charisma. That's when I realised I'd married a sex symbol,' she said.

'In private, he's very romantic, and his dry wit is hysterical,' Mardi said.

Mr Henderson retired from working in television in 2002, and is now focusing his energy on his children and five grandchildren, as well as fighting his battle with throat cancer.

'The prognosis looks good, thanks to early detection. So I'm remaining cautiously optimistic,' he said.
