Israel’s president told how his relatives were burned alive by the Nazis as he warned the world to ‘learn lessons from the Holocaust’ and wake up to the threat posed by a nuclear armed Iran 'before it is too late'.

Shimon Peres and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu both chose the opening of the annual memorial day for the six million Jews killed in the Holocaust
to call on the international community to prevent the militant regime from acquiring atomic weapons.

Mr Peres, 88 - who was born in the Polish town of Vishneva in 1923 and migrated to pre-state Israel before the war erupted - linked the Nazi genocide to Iran's 
suspected drive to build nuclear bombs and its leaders' repeated 
references to the destruction of the Jewish state.

Warning from history: Israel's President Shimon Peres said Iran is a 'threat to world peace' during a speech at the opening ceremony of Holocaust Martyrs and Heroes Remembrance Day at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem

He told hundreds of Holocaust survivors and their 
families, Israeli leaders, diplomats and others at Yad Vashem, Israel's official 
Holocaust memorial, that he learned later how Nazi troops beat members of his extended family and ordered them to march toward the town's synagogue.

He said: ‘Someone yelled “Jews, save 
yourselves!” The Germans shot those who tried to escape. The rest 
arrived at the synagogue that was made of wood. Its doors were locked. 
They were all burned alive.’

Threat: Israel is calling on the world not to underestimate the threat posed by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Iran's leadership

‘That was also the last day of Rabbi 
Zvi Meltzer, my grandfather, my mentor. He was burned with a prayer 
shawl on his head. That was the last Jewish day in Vishneva. Not a 
single living Jew remained.’

Mr Peres, a Nobel Peace Prize 
laureate, said humanity ‘must learn the lessons of the Holocaust and 
face existential threats before it is too late.

‘Iran is at the centre of this threat. It is the centre of terror. It poses a threat to world peace.’

The Israeli flag flew at half-mast and
a military honour guard stood at one side of the podium as poems and 
psalms were read and the Jewish prayer for the dead was recited.

Mr Netanyahu also warned: ‘The Iranian regime is acting openly and decisively toward our
destruction, and it is acting feverishly to develop a nuclear weapon to
achieve this goal.’

He added: ‘Those who dismiss the Iranian threat as a whim or an exaggeration haven't learned a thing from the Holocaust.

‘To be deterred from telling the truth
- that today, like then, there are those who want to destroy millions 
of Jews - that is disrespectful of the Holocaust. That is an insult to 
its victims and that is ignoring its lessons.’

The stated links between the Holocaust
and Iran showed how more than six decades later, the mass murder of 
Jews during the Second World War is still a central part of Israel's 
psyche.

Solemn: Tram passengers in Jerusalem bow their heads as it comes to a stop in Jerusalem when a siren sounds for two minutes silence to mark Holocaust Martyr's and Heroes Remembrance Day

The nation was created just three 
years after the end of the war, and hundreds of thousands of dazed 
survivors made their way to Israel.

Today, fewer than 200,000 elderly survivors remain in the country.

The annual memorial day is one of the 
most solemn on Israel's calendar. Restaurants, cafes and places of 
entertainment are shut down, and radio and TV programming are dedicated 
almost exclusively to documentaries about the Holocaust, interviews with
survivors and sombre music.

This morning, Israel is scheduled to come to a standstill as sirens wail for two minutes.

Pedestrians typically stop in their 
tracks, cars and buses halt on streets and roads and drivers and 
passengers stand with their heads bowed.

Further ceremonies include the public 
reading of names of Holocaust victims at sites around the country, 
including Israel's parliament.

Remember: All of Israel comes to a halt - restaurants and places of entertainment shut down - as people pause during a two-minute siren in memory of victims of the Holocaust in the market in Jerusalem today

Last night's main ceremony at Yad 
Vashem included six survivors who lit six symbolic torches to 
commemorate the six million dead. A video segment on each one's personal
story was presented.

Hours before the opening ceremony, an 
annual report by Tel Aviv University on worldwide anti-Semitism said the
number of attacks declined in 2011, but they were generally more 
violent than in previous years.

Moshe Kantor, president of the 
European Jewish Congress, said his organisation expects anti-Semitic 
attacks to rise if European economies sink into further crisis, if 
Israel attacks Iran or if violence erupts between Israel and the 
Palestinians.

He cited the deadly attack on a Jewish
school in Toulouse last month in which a rabbi and three children were 
shot dead, apparently by an extremist Muslim gunman, as indicative of 
his fears.
