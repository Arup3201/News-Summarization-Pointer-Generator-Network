the teen for a burglar.

Mr Meade, 29, is listed as an active-duty health service officer assigned to 1st Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division at Fort Carson.

Herbert said Kiana was entering her home early Monday morning at the time that she was shot.

Police say the girl was shot just before 6am in the 4300 block of Ascendant Drive in northeastern Colorado Springs. She was rushed to the hospital and later died of her wounds.

CW 2 reports that the case was expected 
to be handed down to the district attorney's office after the police 
complete their investigation. The district attorney's office will decide 
what charges to file against the girl's stepfather.

According to a recording of a police dispatch, Kiana may have been trying to sneak into the house through a basement window after a night out when she was shot. 

'I heard three bangs,' neighbor Jani 
Harvey told the station KTRK. 'They weren't all right together. It was 
like bang, bang, bang.'

Police say Kiana was struck in the stomach and chest, and was taken to a local hospital in critical condition.

Young woman: Kiana, pictured left with her mother, was the oldest of three children

The 14-year-old girl was the oldest of three children. On a memorial Facebook page that has been set up in her honor, Kiana, a freshman as Vista Ridge High School, was remembered for her bright personality and infectious smile.

Describing herself on her Pintrest page, Kiana wrote she loves 'basically everything especially food and crazy hairstyles.’

'Im [sic] a total nerd and always will be,' she stated.

Her stepfather hasn't been arrested and it will be up to prosecutors 
to decide whether charges should be filed. Colorado's 'Make My Day' law 
allows residents to defend themselves against intruders.

According to highcaliberdefense.com, the 'Make My Day' law permits homeowners to fire at intruders only if they are certain the intruder will commit a crime other than trespassing. They are permitted to fire if the intruder plans to use physical force, no matter how slight.

Westword reports that the law was first enforced in 1985 after homeowner and medical marijuana grower Al Michaud of Colorado springs used his Smith & Wesson gun to successfully ward off intruders.

'Make My Day' is in reference to Clint Eastwood's famous line he says as a cop in Dirty Harry. It is part of what police refer to as the 'castle doctrine' stemming from the old English common law, 'a man's home is his castle,' says wisegeek.com.
