How do deals still go through after the window closes on transfer deadline day? Why are there always some deals  confirmed after the clock has ticked past 11pm?

It is called the 'deal sheet', and it allows clubs up to an extra two hours after the deadline to get their business done. 

West Brom confirmed the signing of Darren Fletcher from Manchester United after the deadline

'Sometimes it is not easy for clubs to get everything on a deal completed and sent over to the Premier League by 11pm,' says premierleague.com.

'The deal sheets allows a club to confirm that a deal has been reached to allow for additional time to submit the remaining documentation.

'The sheet cannot be used before 9pm and needs to arrive fully completed before the transfer window closes.

'Once the sheet arrives, clubs have an additional two hours after the window closes to submit the full paperwork. But if a club are looking to complete an international transfer, it still has to comply with the FIFA TMS deadline of midnight.'

So it means that for domestic deals, as long as the sheet is submitted in full after 9pm, clubs have until 1am to finalise their deals and send the paperwork through to the Premier League.

This is why transfers such as Darren Fletcher's switch from Manchester United to West Bromwich Albion can go through up to two hours after the 11pm deadline. 

Hull City have completed the signing of Lokomotiv Moscow striker Dame N'Doye

For Hull City's  signing of Dame N'Doye from Lokomotiv Moscow, however, the Tigers had just an hour after the deadline.

This is because the Premier League allows two hours after the deadline - that is their decision - but international transfers must comply with the FIFA Transfer Matching System (TMS) deadline of midnight - therefore only giving clubs one hour after the deadline. 

What is FIFA's TMS? 

FIFA’s TMS is an online database to which all information must be uploaded for the transfer to gain international clearance.
