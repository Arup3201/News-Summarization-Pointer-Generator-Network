Fernando Torres has been officially unveiled as an AC Milan player, following his two-year loan move from Chelsea.

Torres ended a disappointing four years at Chelsea after his £50million switch from Liverpool when he completed a two-year loan deal with the Rossoneri. 

The 30-year-old is delighted to make the move over to Italy, and will hope for a fresh start in Serie A.

Torres never found his former lethal former at Chelsea, scoring only 45 goals in a frustrating 172 appearances for the Blues.

The Spaniard's deal with Milan ends in June 2016, which coincides with the expiry of his current Chelsea contract.

Torres became a perennial substitute under Jose Mourinho at Chelsea, but the 30-year-old has refused to criticise his former manager.

'I had a professional relationship with him,' said Torres. 'I learned so much.

'When I told him that I was going to Milan he wished me good luck, and he told me about the passion for football that is here.

'I wish him all the best, as he has done with me.'

Fresh start: Torres joins Milan on a two-year loan deal to see out his Chelsea contract until June 30 2016

Milan finished eighth last season in Serie A and will be hoping Torres can rediscover his scoring touch to fire the Rossoneri back up the table.

Chelsea team-mate Marco van Ginkel has joined Torres in Milan after completing his own loan deal.

The young Holland midfielder, 21, had told the Italians he wanted to stay at Stamford Bridge and fight for his place.

But with his chances looking limited in Jose Mourinho's side, he has decided Milan would be the next best step for his career.
