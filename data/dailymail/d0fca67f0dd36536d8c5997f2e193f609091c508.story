A Missouri family was forced to say goodbye to their pet raccoon, that had lived with them eight years, because of a state law that forbids keeping a wild animal indoors.

The Evans family, who live in Seligman, Missouri, found the orphaned raccoon, they named Scooter, and raised her since she was a newborn cub.

But two weeks ago, the 20-plus-pound Scooter was taken away by agents from the Missouri Department of 
Conservation, who said it was unsafe for Scooter to live inside their home.

Just one of the family: The Evans family (daughter Kayland pictured with Scooter) insist their beloved pet raccoon Scooter is 'a very gentle and loving girl with not an ounce of meanness in her'

'Oh, my gosh, she’s my baby,' the family matriarch Terrissa Evans, 40, told the Kansas City Star.

'She is a very gentle and loving girl with not an ounce of meanness in 
her.'

It is a violation of state law to keep a wild animal indoors as a pet.

Raccoons, though not deemed dangerous to humans, do possess great physical strength and can attack humans if provoked. Animal experts say they can become accustomed to the presence of humans but they are not domestic animals.

But the Evans say Scooter was just another member of the family. 

The lovable pet watched television with the family and even managed to learn to do her business in the litter box, following the example of the family's cat. 

'If they don’t put it in the house, it 
is not confined,' said Larry Yamnitz, chief of the Conservation 
Department’s Protection Division, saying that the family could have had the raccoon live outdoors on their 30-acre farm in Seligman, a rural community just north of the Arkansas line.

'If they put it in the house, it is 
confined' he added.

The family's two teenage children, Kayland, 17, and Zachary, 15, grew up with Scooter and the family is devastated at losing their pet.

'Our entire family is
literally torn up over this ordeal. I have stayed up many nights crying
about what is going on, scared for her as I don’t know where she is or 
how she is doing,' Mrs Evans said.

The family has enlisted an attorney who said the conservation laws are straightforward but is trying to get a dispensation for the despairing family, who fears Scooter is unprepared to live in the wild.

'I have stayed up many nights crying
about what is going on, scared for her as I don’t know where she is or 
how she is doing'

'Under the conservation 
laws, I suspect they probably have a right to do that,' attorney Emory Melton said. 'But, morally, it strikes me as a touch ridiculous.'

'That raccoon 
has been with them for eight years. The only thing the Conservation 
Department can do is turn it out to the woods and, of course, it won’t 
live. It seems utterly ridiculous.'
