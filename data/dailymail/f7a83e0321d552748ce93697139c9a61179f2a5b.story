Recovery: Andrew Marr said he is not pushing to reshoot the title sequence because it would be out of date by Christmas

Dominic Lawson made a characteristically reasonable suggestion in his column in Monday’s Mail: he thought the Andrew Marr Show on BBC1 would be improved, and more honest, if its title sequence showed me as I really am, limping with a stick and with my left arm dangling — rather than striding in confidently, as I used to do.

He made the quite correct point that there is nothing wrong with being disabled, and that those who seek to hide disability do no favours to those who are disabled; perhaps suggesting there is something wrong or to be ashamed of.

So why, then, am I not pressing for us to reshoot the titles of the show to reflect how I really am just at the moment?

The real answer is that I am changing. Many people recovering from a stroke don’t like the word ‘disabled’ at all, on the grounds that it suggests a static condition from which one cannot recover.

And the truth is I’m not disabled in the same way that somebody who has lost a leg, or is born with a disability, might be disabled. 

I’m more in the position of somebody involved in a bad accident, and recovering. 

Doing lots of physiotherapy means that I am seeing small improvements all the time. 

I don’t think I am ever going to be 100 per cent again, or run a marathon again; but I do very much hope that in a year’s time I will be walking far more fluently, and without a stick.

I have already discarded a lot of the orthotic and electronic aids I used to need in order to walk at all. I’m getting tiny amounts of use back in my left hand and arm. It’s very slow, and there are times when I despair, but the general direction is still forward.

Nothing is certain, and it’s possible that I remain stuck where I am for a long time to come. 

But just as a title sequence showing me as I was six months ago would not be accurate in portraying me as I am today, so I think a new title sequence shot now (and it is an expensive, time-consuming business) would be badly out of date by Christmas. 

It isn’t true, however, as Dominic suggests, that huge efforts go into hiding my condition on air.

In my first few appearances back on the programme, I stood with my stick. I don’t need to, any more. It’s perfectly obvious to everyone that I have a semi-paralysed hand.

The only thing I don’t do is make much of it all. But why should I? The show is not about me, but about our guests and what they have to say.

I don’t want people focusing on changes I am going through: I want them to sit and listen to Ed Miliband, or the Prime Minister, or whoever we have on.

It’s very much the same calculation when I’m filming documentaries.

I’ve just finished making three films about the Scots and the English, seen through the stories of famous writers.

Journey: The title sequence shows him riding through parts of London, including Westminster, on a moped

Mostly, in these films, you won’t see me visibly struggling or disabled because I want you to listen to what I’m saying. But where I am filmed walking, I am obviously using a stick and limping.

It’s the difference between hiding something, and not emphasising it.

In my ordinary life, meanwhile, I don’t try in any way to hide what’s happened to me.

I talk about it, far more than I really want to, and I’m constantly photographed or filmed in the street, sometimes doing physiotherapy exercises, and sometimes doing things like riding the tricycle I’ve had to use to replace bicycling.

People at the Stroke Association have told me that my very public stroke, and my decision to get back to work quickly, despite the difficulties, has been good in raising awareness — and, indeed, money.

I’m very pleased.

Focus Mr Marr, who suffered a stroke 18 months ago, says viewers will not see him struggling or disabled in new projects because: 'I want you to listen to what I am saying'

Campaign: The broadcaster says he does not want to be made a 'poster boy'. Instead he believes it is important to work for better physiotherapy treatments for stroke sufferers outside of London

But there is no obligation on anybody, me included, to be a poster boy. What is, I think, important, is to work for better physiotherapy services for those hundreds of thousands of people who have also suffered from a stroke but don’t have the luck to live in Central London, where so much of the best rehabilitation is; and who don’t perhaps have the money to pay for it, as I do.

I am merely one of a million people in Britain who are recovering from neurological damage. Some of us can’t speak or see and are in wheelchairs; others appear almost entirely undamaged.

Most of us, however, face a long and hard struggle to improve.

There is a tiny number of people who have so much determination and energy that they can effectively rehabilitate themselves.

Focus: The presenter also says that his show is about the guests and not about him 

Most of us aren’t like that — and I certainly am not. We need the help of patient, skilled and understanding physiotherapists and trainers.

They cost money — money which the NHS doesn’t have. And yet without that help, few of us can get back to work at all.

It’s a terrible waste of human lives, and an economic waste as well. All those people stuck at home, dependent on carers, who could be out there earning, paying taxes and contributing to the country.

So I believe we need some kind of big reorganisation and financial rethink to help people in my condition help ourselves — a sort of ‘national rehabilitation service’.

If you’re getting bored watching my title sequence, think about that instead!
