British men, rest easy. This summer, cougars are going on tour and they're heading for the Mediterranean.

A poll of female members of CougarLife.com, the dating site for women of a certain age looking for younger men, shows that British cougars can't get enough of Spain.

And it seems that Barcelona is their favourite hunting ground. With 19 per cent of the votes, the Spanish city topped the list.

These cougars' visits won't just be about taking in the sun, sea and sangria. Sight-seeing will also be on the to-do list (though maybe not the traditional sort). The survey reveals that a majority of the women polled plan on seeing some action. 70 per cent hope to 'hook-up' with younger men while on their holiday.

And they know who they want: 53 per cent intend to pounce on hotel or activity staff, while just over half have the hots for tennis and golf instructors.

Miss CougarLife.com's Marlo Jordan, voted in as the site's ultimate cougar, said, 'For cougars like myself who enjoy flirting with young attractive men, Spain is one fabulous playground so Iâ€™m not surprised it took the number one spot for women looking for their dream cub.'

The business owner and dating coach added, 'We like luxury, spas, beach-front cocktails and handsome Mediterranean men who appreciate mature woman and are not shy of expressing themselves.'

With 17 per cent of the vote, the Canary Islands were also popular with the survey's 1,043 respondents. In third place was Cyprus (17 per cent), followed by Greece (14 per cent) and Egypt (8 per cent).
