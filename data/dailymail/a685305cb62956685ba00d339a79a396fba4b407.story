Barely 12 hours after the last firework popped over the Olympic Park last night, the centrepiece venue of the Games looked like a ghost town.

There wasn't a spectator in sight today at the Olympic Park stadium in Stratford, as athletes, visitors and VIPs began their exodus from the capital.

After 16 days of non-stop sporting action on the grounds in Stratford, proceedings were officially brought to a close at last night's closing ceremony.

What a difference a day makes: The Olympic Park was completely empty today after it opened its doors to thousands over the course of the Games

The party's over: The set of the closing ceremony is dismantled and taken away today

What a difference a day makes: The Olympic Park stadium was packed out yesterday for the closing ceremony

Instead it was the morning after the night before. Workmen and Park staff were on site to clear up the mess from the blockbuster closing ceremony.

As the excellent weather finally gave way, the workers packed away the sets and props from the closing ceremony under overcast skies as the party seemed to be well and truly over.

At its 80,000 seat capacity, the stadium looked like a shell as the dust settled after last night's spectacular.

The Spice Girls, George Michael, Madness and One Direction - amongst others - wowed the packed venue until midnight last night, but there wasn't a soul in sight today.

Many did not want the proceedings to draw to a close. In fact, athletes and celebrities took to Twitter to voice their disdain that the Games was drawing to a close.

Game over: The Olympic flame was put out last night

Burning bright: The cauldron was extinguished gradually at the end of the closing ceremony, signalling the end of the London Olympics

Danny Boyle's innovative cauldron was slowly opened up and extinguished at the end of the closing ceremony - officially signalling the end of London's third Olympic Games in its history.

Sir Chris Hoy said: 'If they don't put the flame out, the Games won't be over. Someone stop them!!'Stephen Fry tweeted: 'I don't want it to end *sob* *stamps foot*.'

Others were simply glad to have been part of the historic Olympics closing gambit.

Model Jourdan Dunn tweeted: 'Highlight of my career so far, feel so honoured.'

Victoria Beckham wrote after The Spice Girls performed in front of the 26 million strong television audience: 'We did it!! I love you girls so much!!!!!', and fellow Spice Girl Mel B said: 'Soooo much fun!'

But the Games hasn't left the capital just yet. The Paralympic Games is due to startÂ  at the end of the month, with the opening ceremony taking place on August 29.

With more than 2.1 million tickets sold out of a total of 2.5million, the current Paralympics is already beating the previous record of 1.8 million ticket sales at Beijing in 2008.

So Olympic Park will be thriving once again for at least a week and a half until the closing ceremony on August 9.

After that though the stadium is likely to close for a year, and could be taken over by local east London football club West Ham.

There is also talk of the stadium being kept as an athletics venue, however it will be difficult to get even close to the 80,000 capacity until the World Championships are hosted in London in five years time.

Operation clean-up: Workers had a tough job on their hands to clean up the mess from last night

Last night the stadium was filled to the rafters. Athletes were paraded on the turf in front of the capacity crowd.

Then a festival, party atmosphere 
overtook the venue, as a number of musical acts, models like Kate Moss, 
and even Russell Brand and Eric idle were on stage to celebrate the 2012
London Games.

But now the stadium is empty. Workmen
were on site this afternoon to pack up the detritus and equipment from 
the closing ceremony.

They will clear the area before preparing the venue for the Paralympic opening ceremony.

The athletes have left Stratford too. They were queuing in their droves at train stations and airports across the capital.

Heathrow set up a special terminal for the stars to relax in before they got their flights to their homelands.

Meanwhile at St Pancras, the 
Netherlands team and the France team queued on one of the busiest days 
of the summer to await the Eurostar back to the continent.
