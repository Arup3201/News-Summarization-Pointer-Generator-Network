Emergency responders closest to the mountain where a 21-year-old student was swept up in a deadly Utah avalanche were never dispatched to the scene, it has emerged.

Ashleigh Cox, a Brigham Young University student from Colorado Springs, was snow-shoeing and tubing with friends at Tibble Fork Reservoir in American Fork County on February 8 when the group upset the snow, sparking an avalanche that carried Cox down the mountainside.

The slide swept Cox into a stream where she was held underwater and covered in snow until her friends dug her out 20 minutes later. A witness drove from the mountain to get cell service to call 911.

But once 911 was contacted, dispatchers failed to send the nearest team - causing a delay in reaching Cox and depriving her of precious minutes of oxygen, the Deseret News reported.

Killed: Ashleigh Cox, 21, was caught in an avalanche and trapped under snow for at least 20 minutes before she was found. Records suggest that the nearest emergency crew to her was not dispatched

'This can't happen again,' Lone Peak District Fire Chief Brad Freeman told the paper. 'This is unacceptable. We're in the business of saving lives.'

The avalanche took places at 5.28pm and scooped up four of the group, although three managed to get free. A man who had been sledding nearby was asked to call 911 for help.

'It's Tibble Creek Reservoir,' he told the Utah Valley Dispatch Special Service District at 5.40pm. 'There's an avalanche. We've lost someone there.'

Three deputies with the Utah County Sheriff's Office were dispatched from different locations three minutes later and dispatchers repeatedly tried to get through to the sheriff's search and rescue team.

But just two minutes away from the 
canyon were Lone Peak paramedics and firefighters who were ready to go -
they just didn't receive a call.

Ten
 minutes after the initial call, the team were paged and told to call 
the dispatchers, who then said that other emergency services were on 
their way.

Scene: The group were walking near Tibble Fork Reservoir when they disturbed the snow on February 8

'Do you want us to head up that direction?' a firefighter asked the dispatcher, records show.

'That's
 up to you,' the dispatcher replied. 'We're just giving you a heads-up 
at this time 'cause we don't have any, you know, confirmation or 
anything yet. We've got deputies en route.'

Anger: Fire Chief Brad Freeman said he had to dispatch his own team - the nearest to the scene

The fire chief, Freeman, decided to send his team.

He told the Deseret News: 'We were never dispatched. We had to self-dispatch on this call.

'What stands out the most is kind of how nonchalant the call (dispatcher) was and leaving it up to us.

'I'm not saying it wasn't taken seriously, but we should have been dispatched immediately. I mean, this is a critical call the way the caller called it in.'

A police officer nearest to the scene reached the group at 5.58pm, where he learned that Cox had just been found face down in three feet of water. Bystanders were administering CPR.

The Lone Peak ambulance arrived at 6.06pm, about 26 minutes after the 911 call was made and about 20 minutes after she was found.

Cox was taken to Utah Valley Regional Medical Center but she was taken off life support the next day.

Freeman said he does not know if the 10-minute delay in his team reaching the scene could have saved her life, but it would have given her more oxygen.

'I can't say she would be alive today,' he said. 'But her chances would be a lot better... This cannot happen again.'

Loss: Cox was rushed to hospital nearly half an hour after the avalanche and died the following day

No hope: Staff at the Utah Valley Regional Medical Center were able to revive Cox but her life support was switched off the next day. Freeman said if they had got there earlier, she might have had a chance

Freeman said he will be investigating further, while Utah Valley Dispatch Special Service District said a review of the incident was being conducted.

Utah County Sheriff's Sgt. Spencer Cannon said the avalanche that struck Cox was short and narrow, extending about 80 yards on a steep hill.

'It wasn't a big one - It was just enough to get caught up in it,' he said.

The
 Utah Avalanche Center issued a red-level advisory for the day of the 
tragedy, and reported several natural-occurring slides throughout the 
day along the Wasatch Front.

Around 4 p.m., the Utah Avalanche Center reported that slide danger had become extreme.

Cox spent three months of last year in Romania, where she was on exchange with BYU to work with children in an orphanage and childrenâ€™s hospital. She documented her experiences in a blog.
