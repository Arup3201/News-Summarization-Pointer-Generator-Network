Victim: William Haring, pictured, was crushed to death at a machine shop in Ohio

A 60-year-old man was crushed to death at a machine shop in Ohio where he had worked for 38 years.

The victim has been identified locally as longtime employee William Haring.

The shop where the fatal accident took place, Logan Machine Company, was previously found to be in violation of  numerous serious safety and health regulations.

An Akron police spokesman said the accident occurred sometime between 10 p.m. Friday and around 4:45 a.m. Saturday, when co-workers found him.   

Co-workers used a crane to lift a large metal frame off the victim. 

The spokesman would not identify the man but said he lived in the Akron suburb of Green.

Lt. Rick Edwards told WKYC the victim was William Haring, and that he was stuck in the middle of a workbench and a steel part.

The causes of death were 'blunt force trauma' and 'crushing injuries to the torso,' the Summit County Medical Examiner's Office told the NBC affiliate.  

Ohio.com reported that Haring had been a  foreman at Logan Machine Company. 

He was a company employee for 38 years, the website reported.

The Occupational Health and Safety Administration proposed $66,000 in penalties against Logan Machine Company in 2012 for eight serious safety violations and seven serious health violations.

The company did not immediately return a call seeking comment on the accident Sunday.
