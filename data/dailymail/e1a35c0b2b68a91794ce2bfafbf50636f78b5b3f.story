Elite athletes are not only fitter and faster than most mere mortals, but their brains are able to process information far more quickly, researchers have found.

Experts studied the 87 top-ranked 
Brazilian volleyball players, some medalists in the Beijing and London 
Olympics, and found they excelled in how fast their brains take in 
and respond to new information.

'I think we have learned that athletes 
are different from us in some ways,' said University of Illinois 
psychology professor Arthur Kramer, who 
led the study with graduate student Heloisa Alves.

'We found that athletes were 
generally able to inhibit behavior, to stop quickly when they had to, 
which is very important in sport and in daily life,' Kramer said.

'They were also able to activate, to 
pick up information from a glance and to switch between tasks more 
quickly than nonathletes.

'I would say these were modest differences, but they were interesting differences nonetheless.'

Overall, the athletes were faster at memory tests and tasks that required them to switch between tasks.

They were quicker to notice things in their peripheral vision and to detect subtle changes in a scene.

And in general, they were better able to accomplish tasks while ignoring confusing or irrelevant information.

The team also found that being an athlete minimizes the performance differences that normally occur between women and men.

Female athletes, the researchers 
found, were more like their male peers in the speed of their mental 
calculations and reaction times, while nonathletic females performed the
same tasks more slowly than their male counterparts.

The study appears in the journal Frontiers in Psychology, and the researchers say they are still unsure if the skills or learnt, or athletes were born with them.

'Our understanding is imperfect because 
we don't know whether these abilities in the athletes were 'born' or 
'made,' " he said.

'Perhaps people gravitate to these sports because 
they're good at both.

'Or perhaps it's the training that enhances their 
cognitive abilities as well as their physical ones.

'My intuition is that
it's a little bit of both.'
