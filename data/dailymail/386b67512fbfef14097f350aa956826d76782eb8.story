For a winter break on a budget, British holidaymakers should look no further than the Canaries.

The islands of Fuerteventura and Tenerife have the cheapest in-resort costs for Britons while Caribbean hotspots Turks and Caicos and Barbados rank among the priciest destinations, a study says.

For a family of four, the cost of a week-long trip could amount to just £525 in Fuerteventura and £574 in Tenerife.

While the Canaries proved wallet-friendly, Caribbean favourites such as Turks and Caicos and Barbados can cost up to as much as £3,952 and £2,095, respectively.  

Other good-value destinations include Goa in India (where the costs were £606), Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt (£608), Marrakesh in Morocco (£633) and Lanzarote in the Canaries (£645).
