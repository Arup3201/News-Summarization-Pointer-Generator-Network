No, she’s not suddenly gone all film star on us...

The reason the Queen is wearing dark glasses with a glittering Swarovski ‘Q’ on each side is that she is watching a preview of her Christmas message, which has been filmed in 3D for the first time.

Seen here in her 3D glasses as she chats to senior staff from Sky News, who have produced this year’s message, the 86-year-old monarch is said to be thoroughly delighted with the result.

A Buckingham Palace spokesman said the Queen thought the broadcast was ‘absolutely lovely’, adding: ‘We wanted to do something a bit different and special in this jubilee year, so doing it for the first time in 3D seemed a good thing, technology-wise, to do.

'The Queen absolutely agreed straight away – there was no need for convincing at all, she was absolutely ready to embrace something new in this year.’

It is not the first time the Queen has worn 3D glasses. In fact, the pictured pair were first seen when she went to a movie training centre in Toronto, Canada, in 2010.

During her message, which will be broadcast at 3pm tomorrow, the Queen will talk about the impact of London 2012, saying: ‘All those who saw the achievement and courage at the Olympic and Paralympic Games were further inspired by the skill, dedication, training and teamwork of our athletes.

‘In pursuing their own sporting goals, they gave the rest of us the opportunity to share something of the excitement and drama.’

When the message is broadcast tomorrow the Queen and Prince Philip will be at Sandringham with other royals – but they will not be joined by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

The couple have decided to break with tradition as a result of 30-year-old Kate’s pregnancy and continuing sickness and instead spend Christmas with the Middleton family.

However, they will make an appearance at Sandringham on Boxing Day for the regular pheasant shoot on the 20,000-acre Norfolk estate and are expected to remain there for a couple of days.

The move has led to speculation that the couple may choose to spend alternate Christmases with their respective families, as many modern couples do.

Prince Philip at Sandringham yesterday

The Queen missed the Sunday church service at Sandringham for the first time in living memory yesterday after being hit by a nasty bug.

A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ‘She is getting over the tail end of a cold.

'It will certainly be business as usual this week.

She hopes to be at church for the Christmas Day service, absolutely.’

Prince Philip, 91, led the royals who did attend the service, including Prince Andrew and his daughters Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie.

Prince Edward and the Countess of Wessex and their daughter Lady Louise, nine, also attended
