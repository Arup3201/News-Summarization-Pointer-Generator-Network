Welsh hurdler Rhys Williams is out of the Commonwealth Games after being charged with a doping violation.

The 30-year-old son of former Wales and British and Irish Lions rugby winger JJ Williams, failed a test at the Glasgow Grand Prix event on July 11 and has been provisionally suspended from all competition.

He becomes the second Welsh athlete to be forced out of Glasgow 2014 over an alleged doping offence after 800m runner Gareth Warburton was withdrawn earlier this month.

Defence: The son of former Wales and British and Irish Lions rugby winger JJ Williams (left) claims he has not 'knowingly' taken any banned substances 

Williams said he was 'absolutely devastated' by the news of his failed test and insisted he had never knowingly doped.

In a statement released through his management company Concept Sports Management, he said: 'I am utterly devastated about the news of this anti-doping rule violation, which has come as a great shock to me. From the outset, I would strongly like to state that I have not knowingly taken any banned substance.

'As a professional athlete, I have always supported and have been an advocate of clean sport. However, I recognise that the responsibility for this situation lies with me and I'm committed to working with UK Anti-Doping and will fully co-operate in the legal process.

'I'd like to take this opportunity to wish all the best to my team-mates at the Commonwealth Games. To be named co-team captain for the Welsh athletics team was a great honour and I am distraught that I won't be able to fulfil this role and join them as part of Team Wales. I wish them all well.

Legends: JJ Williams played 30 tests for Wales and made seven appearances for the British Lions as a winger during the 1970s 

'Finally, in line with this process and until the hearing of the national anti-doping panel, I will not be making any further comment.'

Welsh Athletics confirmed Williams had been suspended. In a statement, it said: 'Rhys has the opportunity to respond to the charges against him and to have those charges determined at a full hearing before the national anti-doping panel.

'Welsh Athletics strongly supports clean sport and has established a comprehensive education programme for its athletes.

Disappointed: Williams has said he is shocked and 'absolutely devastated' by the results

'Welsh Athletics is obviously concerned that this is the second anti-doping violation by a senior Welsh international athlete and will be conducting its own internal review.'

Williams, who was the co-captain of the Welsh athletics team in Glasgow, won the European title in Helsinki ahead of London 2012. 

UKAD chief executive Andy Parkinson said: 'UK Anti-Doping can confirm the provisional suspension of athlete Rhys Williams after being charged with committing an anti-doping rule violation under the IAAF Anti-Doping Rules.

'The athlete has the opportunity to respond to the charges against him, and to have those charges determined at a full hearing before the National Anti-Doping Panel. 

Malaysian cyclist who courted controversy with 'Save Gaza' protest following race is allowed to stay in Commonwealth Games 

A Malaysian cyclist who caused controversy by writing 'Save Gaza' on his gloves during the Commonwealth Games has avoided a ban.

Azizulhasni Awang raced  in the men's sprint wearing gloves with 'Save' over one knuckle and 'Gaza' over the other. He clenched them together and held them up to the camera as he crossed the finish line

The Commonwealth Games launched an investigation into the gesture, but decided not to expel him from the games. 

Palestinian health officials say at least 750 Palestinians, mainly civilians, have been killed since the conflict with Israel began on July 8.

Israel is trying to halt rocket fire from Gaza and destroy cross-border tunnels.
