How many UFO sightings are actually drones?

According to paranormal expert Lee Speigel, far more than you might think.

The National UFO Reporting Center has reported that UFO sightings jumped by 42 per cent between 2011 and 2012.

Writing in HuffPost Live, Mr Speigel claims that the increased use of unmanned drones by government and private groups is responsible for this figure.  

‘The thing about drones is…that you can make them look like UFOs,’ Mr Speigel said.

‘You can go to the local hardware store, and for not a lot of money, you can pick up the materials you need…to make people go crazy.’

In September, for instance, spectators at the Nat Bailey Stadium in Vancouver, Canada, were stunned to spot what appeared to be a UFO in the sky.

Mysterious: The internet exploded with sightings of the 'alien spacecraft' being driven along the Capitol Beltway near College Park on the back of a truck at around 11 p.m.

The blue object, adorned with the requisite flashing lights, appeared during the first game of the best-of-three North Division final between the Vancouver Canadians and Everett AquaSox.

The UFO was in fact a drone flown by the Canadian planetarium to deliberately fool spectators.

Another incident last year saw hundreds of people in Washington D.C. get the shock of their lives when they saw a UFO being transported across a local highway.

Many people Tweeted pictures of the mysterious object alongside exclamations of concern and astonishment.

‘A UFO In Maryland! Where’s Men In Black When You Need Them!’ @AyeeKeithyKeith said of the saucer-shaped vehicle.

The ‘alien spacecraft’ was in fact an experimental X-47B being driven along the Capitol Beltway as it was moved from West Virginia to Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Southern Maryland.

The problem, noted Mr Spiegel, is that many drones are deliberately designed to look like flying saucers.

Or, as many UFO enthusiasts might believe, that's what they want you to think....
