Germany is bracing itself for a period of chaos and instability amid claims Greece will exit from the euro, finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble (above) said

Germany is bracing itself for a period of chaos and instability amid claims Greece will exit from the euro. 

Finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble said he is resigned to the possibility of a Greek exit from the calamitous euro experiment.

In a TV interview on Thursday evening he was asked if he could envisage it and he replied: 'Yes, because the responsibility, the ability to decide what happens, resides with the Greeks, and because we do not know what the leaders intend to do in Greece, we cannot exclude it.' 

Chancellor Angela Merkel has also run out of patience with the new anti-austerity government in Athens, reports suggested.

Their comments represent a tectonic shift from the previous undiluted support Germany offered Greece - a country whose financial mismanagement is loathed by EU lawmakers.

And in recent days tensions between Berlin and Athens have spiked even further. 

The new Tsipras government first threatened to seize German businesses and assets if Germany did not provide billions of pounds of compensation for damages caused during the Nazi occupation during World War II.

Greece also made a threat to send refugees - terrorist suspects among them - from its shores to Germany if Berlin did not support it in ongoing debt crisis talks.

'If they deal a blow to Greece, then they should know the migrants will get papers to go to Berlin,' Panos Kammenos told a meeting of his right-wing party Independent Greeks.

He also said that if some of the refugees were members of the terrorist group Isis, it would be Europe's fault because of its position on Greece's economic problems.

On Thursday the Greek ambassador in Berlin made an official complaint to the foreign ministry about the behaviour of Schäuble towards his Greek counterpart Yanis Varoufakis. The Ambassador claimed that Schäuble had called Varoufakis naïve, a charge he denies.

Schäuble said Greece can only get more funds if it sticks to the agreements with its creditors.

He said: 'Europe stands ready to help Greece, but Greece must be prepared to help itself. The problem will not be solved by turning others into scapegoats.'

His comments were made as a new poll showed 52 per cent of Germans would be happy for Greece to quit the common currency while 80 per cent believe that Greece is not acting seriously in trying to adhere to its obligations on debt repayments and financial reforms.

A Greek exit would plunge Germany's financial institutions into crisis and the impact on other countries - including the UK - could be severe.

There would almost certainly be a 'flight to safety' as depositors pull euros out of other potentially vulnerable eurozone members such as Portugal, Spain and Italy to avoid taking a hit. European company share prices would also fall sharply. 

Experts say Britain would be hit extremely hard. Almost half of British trade is with Europe and a continental slump would translate into lost orders and jobs while the financial chaos would also hit the City.
