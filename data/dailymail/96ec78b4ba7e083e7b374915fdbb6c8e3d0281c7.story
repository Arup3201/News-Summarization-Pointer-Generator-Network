A close political ally of  French Socialist president Francois Hollande has two accounts in an offshore tax haven, it emerged yesterday.

The embarrassing financial arrangements of Jean-Jacques Augier, who made millions as a publisher, are a fresh blow to a left-wing  government committed to sky high taxes for the rich.

It follows the departure of Mr  Hollande’s budget minister Jerome Cahuzac after it emerged that he had kept a secret bank account in Switzerland with £500,000.

Now leaked documents have revealed 
that Mr Augier, who was  Mr Hollande’s treasurer during  the 2012 
presidential campaign, keeps much of his fortune in the  Cayman Islands.

Mr Augier, a close friend of the 
president, admitted to the newspaper Le Monde that he has two  offshore 
accounts, insisting:  ‘Nothing is illegal’.

Mr Cahuzac had issued denials to the 
president and the French public over his Swiss account, leaving  Mr 
Hollande politically exposed.

Embattled: Mr Hollande yesterday broadcast a hastily recorded televised address in a desperate bid to contain the widening firestorm caused by revelations about the financial affairs of members of his Socialist Party

Jean-Francois Cope, head of the 
conservative UMP party, said: ‘Either Francois Hollande knew nothing, 
and that’s extremely serious because it means he showed a certain amount
of naivety, or he knew and that means he lied to the French people.’

In a televised address Mr Hollande 
insisted Mr Cahuzac ‘benefited  from no protection other than  the 
presumption of innocence and that he left the government at my request 
as soon as a judicial inquiry was opened’.

The president pledged a new law within weeks aimed at ‘controlling’ the wealth of ministers, and making it public.

Mr Cahuzac, a political heavyweight, had been specifically asked by Mr Hollande to launch a fight against tax evasion.

He had previously dismissed as ‘crazy’ reports that he held an undisclosed account at the Swiss bank UBS.

The financial arrangements of 
Jean-Jacques Augier, who made millions as a publisher, are a fresh 
embarrassment to a left-wing government committed to high taxes for the 
rich.

It follows the forced resignation of 
Mr Hollande’s budget minister earlier this week after it emerged that he
kept a secret bank account in Switzerland with more than half-a-million
pounds stashed away.

Now leaked documents show that Mr 
Augier, who was Mr Hollande’s treasurer during the 2012 presidential 
campaign, keeps much of his fortune in the Cayman Islands.

his public resignation, had a secret Swiss account which was 
later transferred to Singapore

He
said the companies, one of which is a distributor based in China, had 
been set up to form partnerships with foreign entrepreneurs.

They were identified after an 
investigation into offshore accounts by the Washington-based 
International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, working in 
conjunction with a variety of media organisations including Le Monde.

The
tax row has rapidly turned into a major crisis for Francois Hollande’s 
Socialist government after former budget minister Jerome Cahuzac was 
placed under investigation for fraud and money laundering.

Opposition
MPs have already called for the resignation of both Jean-Marc Ayrault, 
the prime minister, and Pierre Moscovici, the finance minister, as well 
as a major reshuffle.

Mr Hollande broadcast a hastily recorded televised address in a desperate bid to contain the widening firestorm.

He insisted Mr Cahuzac ‘benefited from no protection other than the presumption of innocence and that he left the government at my request as soon as a judicial inquiry was opened’.

Mr Hollande pledged a new law within weeks aimed at ‘controlling’ the wealth of ministers, and making it public.
