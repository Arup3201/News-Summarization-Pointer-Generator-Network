Prime Minister Tony Abbott has reacted angrily to a UN report that stated the government's asylum-seeker policy breaches the UN torture convention by saying that 'Australians are sick of being lectured to by the United Nations'. 

Mr Abbott was furious that the UN did not acknowledge his government for stopping the boats, and questioned the international organisation's credibility.

The report by UN special rapporteur on torture Juan Mendez focused on the offshore detention on Manus Island of asylum-seekers by Australian authorities.

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott was in a combative mood in Perth on Monday. He was annoyed by a UN report that stated the government's asylum-seeker policy breaches the UN torture convention

It found that the conditions breached Australia's obligations under the Convention against Torture. 

However, Mr Abbott said that the report failed to congratulate the government for avoiding asylum-seeker deaths at sea, and that the report missed the point.

'I really think Australians are sick of being lectured to by the United Nations,' he told reporters in Perth. 

Mr Abbott (centre) was on a visit to Houghton Wines' Swan Valley vineyard in Perth on Monday when he responded to the comments made in the UN report criticising his government's policy

On Sunday Mr Abbott visited Davidson Rural Fire Brigade in Sydney where he received his ten year RFS service medal. But he was in a much less jovial mood after the UN report was revealed 

'Particularly given that we have stopped the boats and by stopping the boats we have ended the deaths at sea.' 

He felt that the UN would be 'much better served' by recognising the government's successes.

'UN representatives would have a lot more credibility if they were to give some credit to the Australian government for what we have been able to achieve in this area,' he said.

Stopping the boats was the most humanitarian, decent and compassionate way to deal with the issue, he emphasised.

Mr Abbott said conditions on Manus Island were reasonable with basic needs like food, clothing, shelter and safety being met.

Mr Abbott said he was also 'sick of being lectured to by the United Nations'
