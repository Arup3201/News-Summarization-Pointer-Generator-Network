Online campaigners Collective Shout has released their annual 'Cross 'em off your list' candidates, revealing the retailers they claim objectified women and used sexual exploitation to sell products throughout the past year.

The grassroots campaign movement is calling for shoppers to boycott the stores when purchasing gifts for Christmas, sending a clear message to the companies they allege used marketing which glorifies violence against women, rape, and pornography.

The list includes retail giants Myer, Bonds, Ultra Tune, General Pants Co, American Apparel, Schick, and Priceline, some of whom Collective Shout spokesperson Melinda Liszewski said are repeat offenders.

Collective Shout's 'cross 'em off your list' identifies retailers who have used sexualised images of women in marketing campaigns throughout 2014 

'Many companies are more than wiling to engage in dialogue about how they are being ethical towards the environment, but seem disinterested in talking about how they are contributing to a toxic cultural environment,' Ms Liszewski told Daily Mail Australia.  

'What we’re wanting to do is shine a spotlight on things that might seem fairly benign, so that people will begin to discuss what it is that they are really buying,' she said.

'Collective Shout has a role in bringing forward the public impact of these campaigns on women and girls, to make people more conscious and to motivate people to speak out and challenge the marketing practices of companies who exploit women for their own profits.' 

One of the companies Collective Shout has identified is 'repeat offender' Cafe Press, who came under fire earlier in the year for selling baby clothes with pornographic content and merchandise which activists say promote rape.

The online retailer, which specialises in user-customised products and gifts, had items for sale on their website printed with the slogans, 'You Smell Like Porn,' 'F**k me like a porn star,' 'Awesome butt sex,' and 'Retired XXL porn star,' among many other similar products.

132 items were available in a category labelled 'Adult Sex XXX Porn Baby Clothing', including baby and toddler onesies, shirts, bibs, and blankets.

Cafe Press came under fire earlier in the year for selling baby clothes with pornographic content and merchandise which activists say promote rape.

City Beach sold explicit t-shirts during the year prompted a 'Say No to Porn' campaign against the products

City Beach was also selling belts with explicit images printed on them

The site has also been accused of promoting rape culture and trivialising sexual assault, by selling a shirt with the slogan, 'No Means Yes, Yes Means Anal'. 

'Café Press has a long history of this kind of behaviour. Many designs are porn inspired, and despite persistent communication the company has continued on with same behaviour,' said Ms Liszewski. 

A spokesperson for Cafe Press released a statement which said that the company was an automated design community, and that the user-designed products varied in topic, taste and opinion.

'At times, users may upload designs that others find distasteful or offensive. It has been recently brought to our attention certain content on our site that may be considered offensive,' the statement said.

'We have taken action to extensively remove the offensive content and will to continue to review for other designs that do not meet our content usage policy.'

Recently added to the list is retailer Big W, which Collective Shout has condemned for continuing to sell the controversial Grand Theft Auto V, which depicts women being brutally murdered as part of the game.

Fresh Boost, a coffee retailer, was added to the list for their explicit marketing campaign which depicted a woman on her knees and a man with his pants around his ankles in an 'implied depiction of oral sex', which Ms Liszewski said has no relevance to the product Fresh Boost was selling

'Even Bonds 'Boobs' campaign, which is supposedly celebrating body diversity, is placing an emphasis on women's bodies and saying that we are defined by our body parts,' said Ms Liszewski

Big W came under fire earlier in the year for selling this girls shirt with a sexualised slogan on the front

'Big W chose profits over ethics, despite the fact that K-mart and Target pulled the game after being contacted by hundreds of campaigners against violence,' said Ms Liszewki.

'The retailer also sold shirts for girls with sexual slogans on them, flouting their corporate responsibility.' 

Fresh Boost, a coffee retailer, was added to the list for their explicit marketing campaign which depicted a naked woman with her legs spread, with the view obscured only by the company's logo.

The company also released an ad which showed a woman on her knees and a man with his pants around his ankles in an 'implied depiction of oral sex', which Ms Liszewski said has no relevance to the product Fresh Boost was selling. 

The other 11 stores have all used sexual exploitation of women and girls to sell products, claim Collective Shout, including Priceline, Bra's 'n Things, and Adairs, who sell the Playboy lingerie range.

'Any retailer that is selling the Playboy brand is actually supporting a corporation which exploits teenage girls,' said Ms Liszewki.

'The Playboy company was failing until it began licensing merchandise, which now props up one of the main brands in the porn industry that own not only the magazine but hardcore pornography companies,' she said.

Collective Shout is campaigning against the use of outdoor advertisements for sexually explicit marketing campaigns

'The bunny logo is cute and teenage girls will look at the nice underwear and won't understand what the symbol actually means, and it's sinister because older men will.'

'Even Bonds 'Boobs' campaign, which is supposedly celebrating body diversity, is placing an emphasis on women's bodies and saying that we are defined by our body parts.' 

Collective Shout is campaigning against the use of outdoor advertisements for sexually explicit marketing campaigns and ads that knowingly target the youth demographic without considering the impact these might have.

'How obviously wrong is it for City Beach to sell a pencil case with a naked woman on it, or for Ultra Tune to use references to BDSM to sell tyres?' Ms Liszewski asked. 

A recent study released by Flinders University has shown figures which indicate that girls from the ages of 8-10 are becoming increasingly preoccupied with their body image, a statistic which Ms Liszewski said shows that ads such as this are encouraging younger and younger women to see themselves as objects to be valued on appearance.

'In older girls, these issues lead to body image problems, anxiety, eating disorders, depression and poor academic performance,' she said.

'Sexualisation is a toxic culture and it is actually making girls sick. If we want a society where sexual harassment isn't a problem then we need to start tackling the culture of objectification.'
