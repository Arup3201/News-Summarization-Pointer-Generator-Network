Tall, slender and beautiful, fashion models appear to have it all. But as these shocking images show, maintaining lovely looks can take a horrifying toll on health.

And at the Lenny show at Rio de Janeiro Fashion Week, the scale of the problem became clear, as models strutted down the runway with just skimpy bikinis to spare their blushes.

Proving that thin doesn't mean healthy, one model's buttocks seemed to be lacking in muscle tone - which some industry insiders say could be the result of skipping workouts and staying slim by eating very little.

'It's
 no secret that a bad diet, little rest, no exercise, caffeine and 
smoking is not good for our bodies,' adds Sheldon Stringer, personal 
trainer and owner of Urban Fitness Islington in London.

'The
 main cause of cellulite is simple: a bad diet of fatty foods married 
with long periods of not eating and dehydration or lack of water intake.

'A lot of people also
 rely on other stimulants and sometimes even substitute food and water 
for these stimulants. This will also lead to diminished muscle tone and 
also promotes the development of cellulite. 

'In
 the case of these models, the stress of having to look their best, not 
eating to try and remain slim and working long hours with little or no 
rest, will result in cellulite build up as seen in these pictures.

'Due
 to the lack of nourishment caused by their bad diets and their intense 
schedules, their muscle mass is compromised as their bodies are starving
 most of the time, which results in flabby or flat muscles.'

Slender: The Lenny show saw numerous very thin girls take to the catwalk

The
 new pictures come in the wake of revelations that models stay 'Paris 
thin' by eating tissues and outrage caused by River Island's use of what
 seemed to be a size zero model in its latest campaign.

The tissue allegations appeared in 
the memoirs of veteran fashion journalist Kirstie Clements, who was 
sacked from her role as editor of Australian Vogue last May.

According to Clements, she once spent three days on a shoot with a model but didn't see her eat a single meal.

By the end of the trip, said Clements, the model was so exhausted and weak from lack of food, she could barely keep her eyes open.

She also revealed that many starve themselves for days on end, endure regular stints on hospital drips and eat tissue paper in order to feel full.

'You know how you read interviews where models insist that they eat a lot? Not true,' added Clements.

'The only way they can get that thin is to stop eating. They eat tissue paper to stave off the hunger pangs – literally ball it up and eat it.'
