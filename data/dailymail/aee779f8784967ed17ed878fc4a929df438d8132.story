Too much alcohol depletes your body’s store of vitamins, piles on empty calories and ages your skin. 

But as countless people embark on a dry January, renouncing all booze, Daryle Knight, 31, from London set out to see if a month of teetotal living  undo the damage?

His aim? To lose weight and look younger by turning his back on his old friend, the pint.

After the inevitable indulgence over the festive period, he set out to discover if a month's abstinence can really reverse the negative effects of alcohol on the body.

Daryle Knight, 31, took on the challenge to ditch booze for one month to see what the effects of a dry January would be. He lost almost a stone and an inch from his waist

Renouncing all alcohol at New Year is as unoriginal a resolution as it is typically unsuccessful.

So, to see if it really works, I pledged to live a month free from booze, abstaining to see what the true affects would be.

At first glance, my body appears untouched by my love of indulging in a drink. But the cracks are starting to show. In fact, they're beginning to hurt.

I start by looking at my vital statistics. At 5ft 11, my 13-stone weight edges me into the 'overweight' category, according to the NHS weight calculator.

My cheeks are flushed and I have dark circles under my eyes. 

And despite my three-day-a-week gym habit, I still have love handles. I’m spending £50 a month to maintain my 33-inch waist, while making zero progress.

Finally (albeit somewhat reluctantly) I face reality and record my drinking habits.

I realise I’m out between three and five times a week, and drinking up to a bottle of wine per night - that's 37 units a week.

And that's motivation enough. 

Day one 

And afterwards

Daryle before 

According to the NHS, cutting your weekly alcohol units can improve skin tone, prevent weight gain and increase energy levels. 

During his month of abstinence, Daryle's waist slimmed from 33 to 32 inches.

And his weight dropped from 13st to 12st. 

I set myself rules - no drinking for the next 28 days.

And I pledge to replace alcoholic drinks with  juice or water, to keep my body hydrated and replenish the stores depleted by nights out.

Four days in 

The first four days of the challenge are pretty easy; I develop a coping strategy - I say no to social invites.

It’s easier to stay in and drink water, than face temptation in the pub. 

But, my first hurdle appears in the shape of a colleague’s birthday.  

The phrase "go on just have one, don’t be a bore" is repeated through the night and at about midnight I think about caving, but instead I just leave early.

On the upside my body is beginning to show signs of transformation.

I spend more time in the gym - and I note it is the only location where people are drinking water out of choice. 

And I notice my strength is improving, as I increase my weights.

Before I could shoulder press 45kg soon I can lift 60kg.

A clearer head has me more focused on maximum results. I increase my arm curls. New definition is definitely emerging.

I also have extra energy, which nutritionist Dr Sue Langham-New explains is due to a better diet and sleeping like a baby. 

It turns out the reason my hangovers felt like jetlag because alcohol affects normal sleep patterns.

With the extra get-up-and-go, my three to four gym sessions a week extend to five to six times a week. 

And I'm even finding the time to cook at home; grilled chicken and vegetables have replaced my post pint steak baguette. 

Burning off the average Vodka Red Bull will involve 12 minutes on the rowing machine, while a glass of champagne will require eight minutes on the badminton court

A smoothie made of pineapple juice, banana, yoghurt and wheat germ can help counteract the effects of alcohol by replenishing potassium and vitamin B in the body

The end is in sight 

By day 26, the end is in sight. On the final day, I look in the mirror again, my stomach is definitely more defined.

I get the tape measure out and my waist is a whole size smaller.

The NHS calculator has me firmly back in a  weight for my height.

My sleep, diet and physical activity have all improved.

The results are impressive but what have I learnt? 

Mainly, I’m in no hurry to stay on this challenge. 

The whole month felt too strict and beyond the 28 days you’d need serious willpower to keep going, which is why the pubs are full come February 1. 

Instead moderation is the method for me.

I definitely want to maintain the benefits, so I’ll be opting for a two weeks on, two weeks off, plus planning more events without alcohol involved.

I want to give my body a break without the contractual abstinence. It's the rebound binge that will sink you.
