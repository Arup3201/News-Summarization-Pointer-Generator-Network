Looking for a new job packed with fun and adventure? You're in luck because a vacancy has just been announced - as a UK beach holiday tester. 

However the applicants will have to fulfill one very important criteria - and it's not about experience or qualifications.

Butlins is launching its search for a ‘Butlins Breaks (High)Chairman’ to join its team. The catch? You have to be under five years old to apply.

Is this the best job in the world? Butlins are seeking an under five to join its board and help road test activities

The successful candidate will be taken from ‘bored to board’, as the youngest ever member to join the Butlins management team, sitting alongside MD Dermot King. 

The primary role of the unpaid (High)Chairman will be to lead the team for one week on the new Just for Tots range of breaks. 

The (High)Chairman will be responsible for road-testing the inaugural break from the child’s point of view, from putting star acts such as Angelina Ballerina through her paces to trying out Annabel Karmel’s new range of kid-friendly dishes.

The candidate will also be responsible for working up a number of recommendations for the breaks based on their experience, which will be implemented across all holidays moving forward to ensure these are curated by children, for children.

Look who's boss! The successful candidate will be responsible for testing the bounciness of beds and slipperiness of slides, among other duties

Other feedback criteria include testing the bounciness of the beds, cuddliness of the characters, splashiness of the water and slipperiness of the slides.

Speaking about the new opening, 
Dermot King said: 'We are eager to find the next Lord Sugar to join our 
team as (High)Chairman - though hopefully not as scary!

'We
 are committed to making our new Just for Tots breaks the best they can 
be with every element looked at from a tots point of view - and who 
better to tell us if we got this right than a tot?'

To apply for this job, the candidate (or their PA-rent) must submit a CV of no more than 100 words to highchairman@butlins.com, outlining their suitability for the role and any previous experience.

The closing date for applications is Friday 7th February 2014.

'We’re looking forward to our new team member getting stuck in straightaway and we take our commitment to their feedback very seriously - if it’s not fun, it’s not in,' added the company.
