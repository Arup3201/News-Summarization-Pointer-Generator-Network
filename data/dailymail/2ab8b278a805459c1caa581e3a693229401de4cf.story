The threat of a huge boycott by customers forced coffee giant Starbucks into paying tax in the UK, Treasury minister Danny Alexander admitted today.

After months of HM Revenue and Customs being accused of being too lenient on multi-national firms who find ways to avoid paying tax, the Lib Dem Cabinet minister said the change of heart of 'more of a reflection' of coffee drinkers threatening to take their custom elsewhere.

The company, which has paid just £8.6million in corporation tax in the UK over 14 years - and none in the last three - is seeking to deflect a consumer boycott and increased taxman scrutiny by voluntarily increasing the amount it pays.

The move comes amid a storm of anger 
surrounding the low levels of UK tax paid by Google, Amazon and other 
major international corporations.

A damning report by the Commons Public Accounts Committee today accuses HM Revenue and Customs of being ‘way too lenient’.

Starbucks, which has more than 700 outlets in Britain, has now met with HMRC officials to discuss increasing the amount of tax it pays.

Mr Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said: 'The comments by Starbucks this morning where they’ve said they want to come to the Treasury and HMRC to talk about their affairs is perhaps more of a reflection of something quite new which is the consumer pressure that has been put on those companies.

Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said 'people pressure' forced Starbucks into paying tax in the UK

'They’ve reported that they’ve had lots of pressures from their customers and that’s a good thing.

'It’s good that the public exercises its rights there but what we can do as a government is put more resources at the disposal of HMRC to make sure they have the ability to get under the skin of what it is that companies and rich individuals too are doing in the tax system.'

Currently Starbucks pays a 'royalty fee' to a sister company in Holland for the right to use the Starbucks brand and recipe, allowing it to benefit from the country's tax regime. This legal accounting tactic helped Starbucks sidestep an estimated £5m corporation tax bill last year.

A spokeswoman said: 'Starbucks is committed to the UK for the long term and we  have invested more than £200m in our UK business over the past 12 years. Starbucks has complied with all the tax laws in this country but has regretfully not been as profitable as we would have liked.

'We have listened to feedback from our customers and employees, and understand that to maintain and further build public trust we need to do more.

'As part of this we are looking at our tax approach in the UK. The company has been in discussions with HMRC for some time and is also in talks with The Treasury. We will release more details later in the week.'

Paid handsomely: UK director John Culver (left) was paid £3.8million over two years and owns £4.7million in shares, while Ex UK boss Cliff Burrows (right) now oversees the firm's Americas operation and has shares worth £7.2million.

Mr Osborne is promising that HMRC
will be given an extra £154million over the next two years to help 
crack down on tax avoidance.

The Treasury forecasts this will claw back 
£10billion over the next five years. HMRC’s ‘affluence unit’ will also 
recruit 100 extra investigators to clamp down on tax-dodging by the 
rich.

The Chancellor plans to bolster the 
Inland Revenue team that deals with multinationals amid widespread 
condemnation of big-name firms like Starbucks, Google and Amazon after 
it emerged they pay little or no corporation tax in the UK.

Mr
Osborne told BBC 1's Andrew Marr Show: 'I think you can do two things. 
One is you can enforce the taxes we have got and I am going to be 
announcing tomorrow extra investment in the part of the Inland Revenue 
that tackles tax avoidance by multinational companies.

'Second,
you make sure internationally we have the right rules and it is 
actually Britain who has been working with Germany and France to get 
those rules on the international table.

'It will be a big priority for the G7, G8, which we host next year.

Labour MP Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said HMRC looks 'way too lenient' in dealing with multi-national firms

'So we are doing those things but let me just say we can't tackle this by pricing Britain out of the world economy.

'If we make our taxes less competitive that will just mean more companies stay out of Britain.'

Ministers are privately irritated by the tone of today’s PAC report, which they say ignores recent improvements by HMRC, which has already been given an extra £900million to tackle tax-dodging.

The cross-party committee of MPs describes the tactics used by multi-nationals to avoid tax as ‘outrageous’, but ‘widespread’ as a result of lax enforcement.

They say the issue accounts for a quarter of the £32billion-a-year tax gap – the difference between the tax HMRC is due and the amount it receives, adding that while the practice of pushing profits overseas into tax havens such as Bermuda and the Cayman Islands is legal, it is also ‘immoral’.

The committee’s Labour chairman Margaret Hodge said: ‘The inescapable conclusion is that multinationals are using structures and exploiting current tax legislation to move offshore profits that are clearly generated from economic activity in the UK.’

She added: ‘HMRC should be challenging this but its response so far to these big businesses and their aggressive tax-planning has lacked determination and looks way too lenient.’

The report says international firms have ‘an unfair competitive advantage over British businesses which have no choice but to pay their corporation tax’.

But Mr Alexander hit back at Ms Hodge: 'I would say to Margaret I welcome what she’s saying this morning, if her party when it was in government  had taken these issues more seriously we’d have a good deal tougher set of rules to be implemented now.'

Last month it emerged that Starbucks has been able to pay handsome wages to its most senior staff over the past three years.

It was reported that finance chief Troy Alstead, who owns £6.8million of shares, was paid £5.7million, and founder Howard Schultz £33million – he also owns shares, worth £545million.

Ex-UK boss Cliff Burrows who now oversees the firm’s Americas operation and has shares worth £7.2million, earned £6.5million. UK director John Culver was paid £3.8million over two years and owns £4.7million in shares.

Bosses of Google, Amazon and Starbucks were recently grilled by MPs over how they managed to pay little or no corporation tax on their UK operations. All three denied they were engaged in aggressive tax avoidance.

At the time, a Starbucks spokesman said: ‘Corporation tax is a tax on profits and although we would very much like to and are moving in the right direction, we just don’t make a profit in the UK yet.

‘Starbucks does however pay a number of 
other taxes in the UK. For example, we directly contribute more than 
£25million to £30million per year to the Exchequer in various taxes, 
including employers’ National Insurance contributions and business 
rates.’
