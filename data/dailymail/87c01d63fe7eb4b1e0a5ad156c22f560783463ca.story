Theo Walcott is in contention to start against Middlesbrough on Sunday as Arsenal attempt to retain the FA Cup following last season's triumph against Hull.

The Arsenal winger will be eager to help his side progress to the latter rounds of the competition after missing last season's 3-2 win at Wembley due to a knee injury.

Walcott has spoken to BT Sport 1 about his love for the FA Cup, opponents Middlesbrough and his relationship with his Arsenal team-mates away from the pitch in the build up to this weekend's action.

What does the FA Cup mean to you? 

To me, being English it’s been one of the traditions, I always used to watch with my Dad. I love the fact big clubs go to the lesser teams, no disrespect to them. And the fans get to see the premier players come to their grounds. 

A lot of fans always want the home matches but I quite like going away from home just for a different experience. It’s nice that fans get to see us in the flesh and to show our stuff and you never know, maybe cause an upset at times.

Last season Arsenal won the FA Cup - you weren’t in that side, but what was it like for the team to win a trophy after nine seasons?

Even though I wasn’t there I was part of the whole setup from the start from the Spurs game which was probably the biggest fixture up till the final. It had been a long time since not winning a trophy and when you go 2-0 down things might not happen for you. 

You’ve got to give credit to the players and everyone out there who dug deep and that’s why the FA Cup is special because it just shocks you at times, with the fact that four big teams went out a few weeks back, no one would have expected that at all. And with the final, no one would have expected Hull to go 2-0 up, so to be fair to them they gave a good game. It was a great watch for the neutral, not for me watching back at home, I was pretty nervous.

Did you feel part of the celebrations?

I noticed that Carl (Jenkinson) had his phone with him straight after the game so I tried calling him and he had a missed call, and then he face timed me and so I managed to get a bit of face time of the guys with the Cup, so it felt like I was there. 

Obviously I had personal things going on at the time so I couldn’t be there but it was nice to know they were still thinking about me. In the dressing room afterwards it was like I was next to them. We had some nice screenshots on the iPhone, so those memories will always stick with me.

Now that you are the holders, is that adding more pressure this time or is it better?

There’s always pressure in every game anyway, I can’t remember the last time it has been retained so there’s always going to be pressure with us being one of the favourites to win it again. 

We’ll deal with that. We deal with pressure in every game. No game is different. We’ll just have to get on with things and continue playing our football and we’ll be fine.

You’re facing Middlesbrough next – what are you expecting?

I’m expecting very similar to the Leicester game – they’ve been doing very well in the Championship. They’ve got a good balance between the way they attack and defend. They beat Manchester City away from home, they’re going to be a good team, so you can’t take anything for granted. 

It’s the FA Cup, there’s always several shocks so we need to completely ready. The last game or two we haven’t started particularly well so we’re going to have to be completely ready because Middlesbrough are challenging to be in the Premier League next year. They are a big club, so we need to not take that for granted.

What is it about the FA Cup that makes is so magic (with some of the recent FA Cup shocks)?

When I saw the results I was cheering to be fair because it’s always great to see a lower team do well and progress because they have to start a long way back. 

A lot of people tend to forget the smaller clubs play a lot of games so you’ve got to give credit to them. The teams that the opposition put out they were strong teams. So it’s not as if they were going to make up the numbers. There’s always something that happens.

Arsenal will be hoping to retain the prestigious trophy after their FA Cup final win against Hull in May 

There’s been quite a few changes in the team, you came back with quite a few new players in the team – how was that for you to come back into that squad?

Change is good. The players that have come in have done very well very quickly. It’s always difficult to settle in the Premier League. I was here every day pretty much throughout the whole summer so I was sensing the changes and the dressing room is no different, still a great family club. 

So they seem to have settled in. And that’s important, if you settle in very quickly, it seems to happen on the pitch for them.

Do the ex-Southampton crew stick together?

Yeah me, Alex and Calum do. I sit next to Alex in the dressing room. I remember when Alex was yay big and his dad was coaching me at Southampton and he used to kick the balls and stuff. So I remember, it was brilliant.

Now Lukas Podolski has gone who is the biggest joker?

Alex has got some good stuff. Good banter. (Wojciech) Sczenczy is not bad as well. Nacho (Monreal) and Santi (Cazorla) as a duo are very good. We call Nacho 'Crouchy' because of the resemblance of him and Peter Crouch, sorry Crouchy.

Which players do you hang around with off the field?

Aaron Ramsey I tend to play a bit of golf with if I can. I try and get Gibbs and Alex out but they’re fair weather players, they only like to play when the sun shines. Me and Aaron are die-hards. 

But things have changed now for me slightly with my first born so I won’t be able to get on the course as much which is fine as he (son) is a great laugh anyway.
