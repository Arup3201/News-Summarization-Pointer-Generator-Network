Real Madrid may have singed a host of new players this summer but they already seem to be settling in well.

Javier Hernandez posted a photo of himself with James Rodriguez and Keylor Navas after the Colombian midfielder returned from playing Brazil the US.

Hernandez wrote: 'Gracias por la gran cena,' or 'Thanks for the great supper.'

Rodriguez, Real's £60million signing from Monaco, played 77 minuted against Brazil before being brought off for Radamel Falcao. But neither could prevent Colombia losing 1-0 courtesy of a late Neymar goal.

Manchester Untied loanee Hernandez played no part in Mexico's 0-0 draw with Chile. 

Likewise, Keylor Navas  was also absent as Costa Rica drew 2-2 with Panama. Late goals from Johan Venegas and Cleso Borges pegged back back Panama after they took the lead early in the second half.
