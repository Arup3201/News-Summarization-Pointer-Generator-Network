Whether tearing off his gillet or kicking water bottles in a rage, spoiling for a fight or trading salutes with Emmanuel Adebayor, the most vivid memories of Tim Sherwood's five-month reign at Tottenham do him few favours.

He seemed too wound-up for a long life on the touchline, destined for self-combustion had Daniel Levy not intervened as he does to press eject. 

But perhaps the biggest mistake Sherwood made at Spurs was to allow this theatre to disguise his real intent.

Following Harry Redknapp's resignation, Tim Sherwood has emerged as the front-runner for the QPR job 

67-year-old Redknapp has left QPR, citing forthcoming knee surgery as the reason behind his decision

He is passionate, committed and ambitious. He is forthright with his opinions and he demands the same in return from those who surround him.

It gets him into trouble and will continue to do so, because he is unlikely to change on this front. If there is one lesson from his time at White Hart Lane, one thing that might change, he may be more controlled on the touchline

His emotional bond is not so deep at QPR and he will feel more relaxed, less anxious to prove his value since he will have the unconditional backing from above, with Les Ferdinand in the role of director of football. 

They know each other well and share an outlook on the game: a vital starting point in such a relationship.

At White Hart Lane, Sherwood's antics were exaggerated by the pressure of a ticking clock. He wanted to make an impression on the players and the board and on those looking on like fans, media and prospective employers. He certainly did that.

There was one notable clash in the technical area with Jorge Jesus as Benfica won 3-1 at White Hart Lane in the first leg of a Europa League tie.

Jesus became annoyed by Sherwood's hyper-activity and there were tetchy words exchanged before the Benfica boss marked his team's third goal by raising three fingers and waving bye-bye to his opposite number.

Sherwood exiled himself to the stands for the second leg to avoid becoming a side-show.

He had always been outspoken, with a sharp tongue and a quick put-down. He branded Chelsea coach Steve Holland 'patronising' and had a pop at Glenn Hoddle, so there was no surprise to see him leave QPR with Harry Redknapp on Tuesday.

Sherwood laid into his own players in private and public in a bid to shake them from their comfort zones. He accused them of lacking guts and not caring. He was not convinced of their commitment and warned they were playing for their futures.

The view seems to have been shared by his successor Mauricio Pochettino, given the new man has frozen out plenty of well-paid 'stars' and launched a concerted bid to get rid of as many as possible in January.

Sherwood was able to get the best out of maverick players such as Emmanuel Adebayor while at Tottenham

Unusually for a Premier League manager, Sherwood was also prepared to publicly criticise his own board for their lack of support.

'The silence is deafening, isn't it?' he said, when asked about his future following a heavy defeat at Chelsea.

He later compared his role to that of a 'supply teacher' as he wondered aloud why it was difficult to impose his authority on players who enjoyed far greater job security than he did.

Sherwood won his argument for 18-month contract when he replaced Andre Villas-Boas, but it did not keep him in the job any longer. 

His straight-talking style is rooted in his confidence and faith in his own football philosophy.

Sherwood is intrinsically 'Old School' in that he believes in British players and coaches. He refuses to accept they are simply inferior to those produced abroad but that they are simply not given the same care and attention.

His contribution to Tottenham's very healthy Academy was greatly admired and he learned to trust young players in his original role at the head of their development system as technical coordinator.

Behind the fury of the flying-water bottles and Full Monty costume changes was his patient work with Andros Townsend, Harry Kane, Ryan Mason, Danny Rose and Nabil Bentaleb. Long after Sherwood has left the club, Spurs are enjoying the rewards.

Sherwood's patient work with academy players like Danny Rose have benefited Spurs long after his departure

Striker Harry Kane has scored 20 goals in 33 games in all competitions for Tottenham so far this season 

Together with Ferdinand and Chris Ramsey, he will provide joined up thinking about how young talent from the Academy is nurtured through the ranks and into the first team, and how that dovetails with the club's transfer policy which clearly requires serious attention.

This ought to be good for QPR, a club which has to learn to live within its means and make more from its local talent, as they did in Ferdinand's playing days.

At the same time, of course, he has to keep them up. Can he inspire the squad left by Redknapp to better things? Can he find a balanced from an imbalanced squad? Can he cajole something special from the enigmatic Adel Taarabt as he did from Adebayor?

This is the great unknown with Sherwood. He is a deep football thinker, confident and passionate. He has success in youth football but can he translate it? Does he have the tactical ability to operate in the Barclays Premier League, where the standards are so high?

After 23 games QPR are 19th in the Premier League table with 19 points and facing a tough relegation battle 

The Hoops' 3-1 loss to Stoke City was the club's 11th consecutive away defeat in the Premier League 

He has yet to complete his UEFA Pro Licence, the elite coaching qualification, but he is midway through the course with the FA of Wales, and this will satisfy the mandatory requirements of Premier League, who let him through a loophole last season.

His experience in the field amounts to 28 games at Tottenham. He won 14 and lost 10. His teams played with adventure and risk; they scored goals and entertained but they leaked plenty too, especially against the best teams, and some tittered when he frowned at the emerging role of the defensive midfielder.

Some claimed that once the initial impact of a different voice had faded at Spurs that he had little else to offer, but there is more to Sherwood. He is ruthless and energetic and he is not short on ideas or ambition. This is what QPR can bank on.

Passionate and committed, Sherwood's high maintenance approach could be the tonic to QPR's woes
