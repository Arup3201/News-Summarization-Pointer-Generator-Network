Security camera footage of an alleged plot to cover up Rebekah Brooks’s involvement in phone hacking was shown to her trial yesterday.

The video shows her racehorse trainer husband Charlie and her security staff hiding evidence while she was being questioned by police, it was alleged.

On the day of former News International chief executive Brooks’s arrest, her 50-year-old husband and News International head of security Mark Hanna allegedly co-ordinated an elaborate operation, codenamed Blackhawk, to remove computer evidence from her Oxfordshire and London homes – hours before police searched them.

Evidence: CCTV images allegedly showing Charlie Brooks hiding evidence while wife Rebekah was being questioned by police were shown to the jury in the hacking trial in January

Mystery: Charlie Brooks was seen taking a jiffy bag and laptop into the underground car park. He is then seen to disappear behind a column and comes back into view empty-handed less than a minute later

While Brooks, 45, was being 
interviewed by detectives, CCTV footage shows her husband walking 
through the car park below their flat in  Chelsea Harbour holding a 
jiffy bag and laptop. He disappears from view and reappears moments 
later holding only his mobile phone at 12.15pm on July 17, 2011.

The
 prosecution at the Old Bailey claim he stashed the padded envelope and 
laptop behind bins so police would not find them. Two hours later, the 
footage shows Hanna arriving in the car park where he met Charlie 
Brooks.

Hanna, 50, then appears to retrieve the envelope, laptop and a brown briefcase and walks away.

Later that afternoon police arrived and searched the flat. Footage shows them leaving with computers and bags full of documents.

That evening Daryl Jorsling, another News International security guard, arrived in the car park.

Footage
 shows him taking a large black rubbish sack – which allegedly contained
 the envelope, laptop and briefcase – out of the boot of his car and 
walking towards the bins. He then returned to the car without it. 
Another man in a white T-shirt is then seen collecting pizza boxes, 
which were allegedly used as a cover for returning the items.

Investigation: CCTV showing police officers carrying various items away from the home of Rebekah and Charlie Brooks

Home: Rebekah Brooks arrives home after her police interview where she is greeted by husband Charlie, in a white shirt

Hunt: Rebekah Brooks is seen standing by the Audi car before Charlie Brooks, Brooks' driver Paul Edwards and security guard Daryl Jorsling are seen going back to the car park and appear to search the bin area

CCTV
 footage then shows Rebekah Brooks hugging her husband in the car park 
after returning from police questioning shortly after midnight.

Denial: Charles Brooks, 50, and his wife deny conspiracy to pervert the course of justice between July 5 and 19 2011

The 
following morning the security cameras show a cleaner removing the bins.
 He also found ‘various pieces of property’ behind the bins, it was 
claimed.

That afternoon, 
Charlie Brooks, chauffeur Paul Edwards and Jorsling go back to the car 
park and appear to search the bin area before heading off to the 
building’s office empty-handed.

Later
 that day, police were handed a brown briefcase and black laptop bag 
which had been found behind the bins, the court was told. The 
prosecution claim this sequence of events shows a clear plot to hide 
evidence of phone hacking.

Earlier
 in the trial, prosecutor Mr Andrew Edis, QC, told the jury: ‘This whole
 exercise was quite complicated, and quite risky, and likely to go 
wrong, as it did.

‘The only
 rational explanation was to hide material so police can’t get it. They 
must have been trying to hide something, otherwise they would have been 
behaving completely irrationally.’

Rebekah Brooks denies conspiring with others to hack phones.

She
 further denies two allegations of conspiracy to pervert the course of 
justice – one with her former  personal assistant Cheryl Carter, 49, and
 a second with her husband Charlie and Hanna. They also deny the 
charges. The trial continues.

Plot: The evidence is alleged to have been hidden while Rebekah Brooks was in custody at Lewisham Police Station on July 17, 2011
