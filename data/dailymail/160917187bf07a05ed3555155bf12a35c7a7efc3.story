Cap: Drivers are paying £200m a year too much for insurance because of accident bills, an investigation has shown

Car accident costs, such as carrying out repairs and providing a replacement vehicle, could be capped to crack down on rip-offs.

The Competition Commission said yesterday that drivers are being overcharged some £200 million a year on motor insurance because accident costs are out of control.

It is also concerned that repairs carried out following accidents may be shoddy and even dangerous.

Concerns were revealed in the provisional findings of a Commission investigation, which concluded the motor insurance market ‘is not working well for motorists’.

The inquiry also raised questions about the cosy relationship between insurers and price comparison website, who take commission to recommend deals.

The websites often make insurers sign contracts that promise not to offer cheaper premiums via rival websites with the result there is no meaningful competition.

The main problems and exaggerated costs surround drivers whose cars are damaged by other road users through no fault of their own.

Generally, their own insurer will supply an expensive replacement vehicle and arrange for repairs, which can take a long time and are often expensive.

These costs are then passed on to the insurer of the driver who was at fault and end up putting up insurance premiums for everyone on the road.

Commission chiefs have outlined a series of measures which it may implement to make the cost of dealing with accidents cheaper and so bring down the cost of motor premiums.

These include making a driver’s own insurer responsible for providing a replacement vehicle, plus caps on the costs of providing a temporary replacement and repairs.

It is also looking at whether it is necessary to carry out compulsory audits on the quality of repairs offered by garages.

The Commission said measures may be necessary to ensure there is genuine competition to offer the cheapest premium on price comparison websites.

Deputy chairman of the Commission, Alasdair Smith, who is leading the motor insurance investigation, said: ‘Our provisional view is that many drivers of the UK’s 25 million privately registered cars are footing the bill for unnecessary costs incurred during the claims process following an accident. These costs are initially borne by the insurers of at-fault drivers, but they feed through into increased car insurance premiums for all drivers.

‘There is insufficient incentive for insurers to keep costs down even though they are themselves on the receiving end of the problem.’

He added: ‘We have concerns about the quality of post-accident repairs because too many repairs are substandard.

‘Price comparison websites lead to increased competition to the benefit of motorists, but clauses requiring the same price to be offered for an insurer’s product across the market reduce competition.’

The investigation has not considered the impact of personal injury claims on premiums, which has been a scandal in its own right.

Britain became the whiplash capital of Europe in the last decade with lawyers and claims firms generating huge bills, often for bogus claims.

The government has made efforts to tackle this abuse by banning ambulance-chased lawyers from paying referral fees to people and organisations who provide details of accident victims. The ban came into effect in April, however it is unclear if it is working.

The Association of British Insurers welcomed the Commission’s efforts to cut down on costs, but it said some of the findings were based on flawed research.

Head of motor at the ABI, James Dalton, said ‘Today’s possible remedies are a further step along the road to getting a market that enables insurers to deliver fully for consumers.’

He said that ‘excessive costs’ in dealing with accidents had been passed on to drivers for too long.

‘We welcome the provisional remedies which could give the at-fault insurer greater control over the claim they are paying for and reduce the overall cost of providing replacement vehicles to customers,’ he said.

Mr Dalton also welcomed efforts to stop price comparison websites from limiting competition on premiums.

However, he said the commission’s concerns about shoddy vehicle repairs and the need for quality audits were based on a flawed inspection report which looked a very small number of cases.
