Coral reefs are often associated with tropical climates and enjoyed by snorkellers for their multi-coloured beauty.

But it would take a brave holidaymaker indeed to brave the one recently discovered by Canadian researchers - it's in the freezing waters of southern Greenland.

The reef is comprised of what are called living cold-water corals and while there are several species of coral in Greenland, this is the first time that an actual reef has been found.

The newly discovered living reef is located off Cape Desolation, south of Ivittuut, and lies at a depth of 984 yards (900 metres) in a spot with very strong currents, making it difficult to reach.

This also means that so far little is known about the reef itself and what lives on it.

The reef was discovered by accident when a Canadian research vessel needed to take some water samples. When the ship sent the measuring instruments down to the depths, they came back up completely smashed.

Fortunately, there were several pieces of broken coral branches on the instrument that showed what was responsible.

'At first the researchers were swearing and cursing at the smashed equipment and were just about to throw the pieces of coral back into the sea, when luckily they realised what they were holding,' says PhD student Helle Jørgensbye, of the Technical University of Denmark.

Deep-water coral, also known as cold-water coral, tend to be found in deeper, darker parts of the oceans than tropical coral, ranging from near the surface to beyond 2,187 yards (2,000 metres) where water temperatures may be as cold as 4°C.Like tropical coral, they provide habitat to other species. They were first discovered by fishermen about 250 years ago.The world's largest known deep-water coral complex is the Røst Reef in Norway.

It lies between 328 and 437 yards (300 and 400 metres) below the waves and is approximately 25 miles long and 1.9 miles wide.

Another Canadian research vessel returned to the site last autumn to try and lower a camera down onto the reef to explore it close up.

The coral reef is on the continental shelf itself where it is very steep and where there are strong currents.

'We got some photos eventually, although we almost lost them at the bottom of the ocean as the camera got stuck fast somewhere down in the depths,' said Mr Jørgensbye.

'It’s been known for many years that coral reefs have existed in Norway and Iceland and there is a lot of research on the Norwegian reefs, but not a great deal is known about Greenland.

In Norway, the reefs grow up to 32 yards (30 metres) high and several kilometres long. The great Norwegian reefs are over 8,000 years old, which means that they probably started to grow after the ice disappeared after the last ice age.

The Greenlandic reef is probably smaller, and we still don’t know how old it is,' he added, expressing the hope that at some point it will be investigated more closely.

Coral reefs are important areas for fish because it provides masses of food and lots of hiding places for fish fry. The Greenlandic reef is formed from Lophelia stoney corals. Other species of coral are also found in many parts of the west coast.

However, they are all 'stand-alone' corals and do not form reefs.
