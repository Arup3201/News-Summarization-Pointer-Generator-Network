Israel has launched a series of airstrikes on targets in the Gaza Strip killing at least two people including a three-year-old girl and wounding nine, Hamas officials have said.

The airstrikes are in retaliation for the deadly shooting of an Israeli civilian.

It is the heaviest flare-up of violence along the volatile border in months and threatened to destabilise a cease-fire between Israel and Gaza's Hamas rulers that largely has held for more than a year.

A series of explosions could be heard in Gaza City this afternoon.

Health Ministry official Ashraf 
al-Kidra said one airstrike killed a three-year-old girl and wounded 
three relatives, including two young siblings.

He said a man was killed in an Israeli attack in northern Gaza. In all, nine people were wounded, one critically, he said.

Israel
 launched the airstrikes shortly after a Gaza sniper shot an Israeli 
civilian laborer as he performed maintenance work on the border fence. 
The man was airlifted to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

The
 incident occurred as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was 
visiting the nearby town of Sderot, a frequent target of Palestinian 
attacks, to inaugurate a new rail line.

'This is a very severe incident and we will not let it go unanswered,' Netanyahu said.

'Our
 policy until now has been to act beforehand and to respond in force, 
and this is how we will act regarding this incident as well.'

Israel
 and Hamas are bitter enemies, but both sides largely have observed a 
cease-fire that ended eight days of heavy fighting in November 2012.

The cease-fire has been tested by periodic rocket and mortar attacks out of Gaza.

Extremists have been behind most of the violence but Israel holds Hamas responsible for any attacks out of the territory.

Israel
 recently discovered a pair of smuggling tunnels leading from Gaza into 
Israel that it said were built by militant groups planning to stage 
attacks.

Today's attack was the latest in a series of violent incidents.

An
 Israeli policeman was stabbed on Monday outside a West Bank settlement,
 hours after a rocket fired from Gaza landed in southern Israel.

On
 Sunday, a pipe bomb authorities believe was planted by Palestinian 
militants exploded on a bus in central Israel, moments after the vehicle
 was evacuated. It was the most serious attack inside Israel in more 
than a year.

Despite the uptick in violence, Israeli officials don't believe the incidents are connected.
