Ever questioned whether the moon landings were faked, whether aliens really crash landed at Roswell or whether there was more to the Kennedy assassination than Lee Harvey Oswald and a lone rifle?

Your view on popular conspiracy theories depends on your political affiliation, according to new findings.

A study of registered voters in the US has found that whether you believe in Bigfoot or think that global warming is a myth depends on which side of the political fence you sit.

Contentious: Opinion was almost literally split in half when US voters were asked whether they though there was a bigger force than Lee Harvey Oswald, right, acting alone in the 1963 assassination of John F Kennedy, left

Sceptics: You're more likely to be a Democrat than a Republican if you think the Moon landings were faked

According to the poll, carried out by the Public Policy Institute, when it comes to some of the most famous conspiracy theories out there, American opinion is split right along party lines.

While a staggering 37 per cent of those surveyed overall believe that global warming is a hoax, it is more likely that you are a Republican if you hold that view.

For almost 60 per cent of Republicans asked thought that the phenomenon was made up while just 11 per cent of Democrats polled agreed.

Republicans are also more likely to believe that aliens crash landed at Roswell in 1947. Around a fifth of those surveyed in total believe that particular conspiracy theory, but just 18 per cent of Democrats believe that a flying saucer came down in New Mexico, compared to 27 per cent of Republicans asked.

About 35 percent of Republicans and Independents believe a secretive group of worldwide elite are trying to set up a totalitarian government known as the New World Order.

But that number falls to just 15 per cent if you quiz a Democrat.

Party politics: Naturally, more Republicans believe that Democrat President Barack Obama, left, is the anti-christ than his own party's supporters, but more Democrats believe that George W Bush misled the US over Saddam Hussein's WMDs stock than Republicans

Unsurprisingly, political affiliation influenced voters' opinions on a number of conspiracy theories involving the US's two most recent leaders.

Asked if current White House incumbent Barack Obama is the anti-Christ, a fifth of Republicans said yes compared to a meagre six per cent of those polled who support President Obama's Democratic party.

And when it comes to the Iraq war and whether Republican ex-President George W Bush misled Americans over Saddam Hussein's WMDs, more than 70 per cent of Democrats say that he did and just 13 per cent of Republicans agree.

And questioned if former Iraqi leader Hussein was connected with the 9/11 terrorist attacks, just over a fifth of Democrats think he was compared to a third of Republicans.

Conspiracy? The twin towers of the World Trade Center pour smoke in New York in this September 11, 2001. Many Americans believe Saddam Hussein was involved in the attacks

But when it comes to some of history's most debated theories, opinion seems to be more divided regardless of political persuasion.

Around seven per cent of Americans believe that the 1969 moon landings were faked, with seven per cent of Democrats quizzed believing that the iconic images of Neil Armstrong taking one giant leap were mocked up, and four per cent of Republicans holding similar views.

Just over half of those polled believe that there was a wider conspiracy involved in the 1963 assassination of President John F Kennedy, with both Democrats and Republicans split almost 50/50 in their views.

And around 15 per cent of both Democrats and Republicans believe in Bigfoot.

Some of the more bizarre conspiracies bought by voters include the idea that Sir Paul McCartney died in 1965 and was replaced by a lookalike so that the Beatles could carry on with their chart success - five per cent believe that is true - with nine per cent worried that the Government is adding fluoride to the water deliberately for sinister means and, surprisingly, four per cent believing in lizard people.
