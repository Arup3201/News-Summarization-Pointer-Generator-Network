This month sees the launch of the UK shingles vaccination programme for the elderly. All adults aged 70 and those aged 79 will be offered a jab.

This is great for anyone vulnerable to this painful condition which affects one in five adults.

Shingles, or herpes zoster, is an infection of a nerve and the area of skin around it. Around 800,000 people will  be eligible for the vaccine.

Protected: The UK-wide vaccination programme is set to protect elderly against shingles

Why is the vaccine only being offered to people aged 70 or 79?

It’s a catch-up programme. Each year, all those who are 70 and all those who are  79 will be vaccinated. It is the quickest and most cost-effective way of getting the most at-risk people vaccinated. After nine years, it’ll just be offered to people when they reach 70.

Why do people get shingles?

Anyone who has had chickenpox can get shingles. The virus lies inactive in your nerve cells for life. Shingles is a reactivation of this chickenpox virus which appears as a painful, sore rash.

Can anyone get shingles?

It affects 20 per cent of the population and is most common in adults. It gets you when you’re down and your immune system is weak.

The shot will be available for men and women aged 70 and aged 79

How can I opt into the vaccination?

Your GP will offer a single jab in the arm.

If it’s just a rash, why is the vaccine necessary?

Shingles is very painful and causes great suffering. While the rash usually lasts two to three weeks, people often have permanent pain in the area of the rash. This neuralgia is debilitating and very difficult to treat. One in 1,000 people over 70 will die from shingles.

Can you have the jab if you’ve had shingles?

Yes. Once you have had shingles you are at a higher risk than normal of getting it again. The vaccine will make  a repeated attack less likely.

Can you get the vaccine if you are under 70?

It is licensed for the over 50s and you can get the jab privately. If you have a medical condition that puts you at higher risk of shingles, chat to your doctor about whether it is worth it.
