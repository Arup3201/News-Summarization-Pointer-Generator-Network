Jean-Claude Juncker - frontrunner for the European Commission - said he won't get on his knees to Britain to secure the post, reports suggest

The frontrunner for the presidency of the European Commission says he will not ‘get on his knees’ to Britain to secure the post, it was reported last night.

In a bitter attack on the UK, Jean-Claude Juncker also condemned what he described as a British campaign against  his presidency.

The former Luxembourg prime minister’s bid for the top Brussels job has been strongly criticised by David Cameron, who warned that the UK could quit the EU if Mr Juncker was to succeed because he is an arch federalist.

Mr Cameron has privately branded Mr Juncker a ‘face from the 1980s’ who ‘cannot solve the problems of the next five years’.

According to The Guardian, Mr Juncker told a closed meeting of the European People’s Party in the parliament in Brussels yesterday: ‘It is wrong if we give in to the British.

'I will not be forced to get on my knees before the British. What bothers me is the gathering British press campaign.’

Mr Cameron, emerging from a bruising round of talks aimed at preventing Mr Juncker from seizing power, warned last night that Britain will ‘drift towards the exit’ of Europe unless Brussels agrees major reforms.

He said Europe could not stick ‘its head in the sand’ and ignore the growing tide of Euroscepticism.

His intervention came as Barack Obama issued his strongest plea yet for Britain to remain in Europe – and for Brussels to make the compromises needed to keep the EU together.

Speaking at a joint press conference following the G7 Summit in Brussels, the US President said it was ‘hard to imagine’ the EU prospering if Britain left.

But he also made it plain the value placed by the US on its old ally retaining a seat at Europe’s top table.

He said: ‘With respect to the EU, we 
share a strategic vision with Great Britain on a whole range of 
international issues, so it’s always encouraging for us to know that 
Great Britain has a seat at the table in the larger European project.’

But
 he added: ‘It’s hard for me to imagine it would be advantageous for GB 
to be excluded from political decisions that have an enormous impact on 
its economic and political life.’

Mr Cameron has spent the past fortnight fighting a rearguard action to prevent Mr Juncker’s coronation as president of the European Commission.

The Prime Minister clashed with German Chancellor Angela Merkel over the issue during heated talks in Brussels in the early hours of yesterday morning.

Aides described the face-to-face meeting at the British ambassador’s residence as ‘candid’ – diplomatic-speak for a bust-up – but insisted the overall tone had been ‘friendly  and constructive’.

Mr Cameron said Europe’s leaders had to listen to voters who backed Eurosceptic parties in record numbers last month.

Negitive interest rates were yesterday imposed in Europe in a desperate bid to breathe life into the economy.

The European Central Bank cut one of its main interest rates from zero to minus 0.1 per cent.

The negative interest rate on bank deposits means commercial lenders will be charged to leave funds with the central bank for the first time.

Banks usually receive interest from the ECB on cash they deposit.

ECB President Mario Draghi hopes it will persuade banks to lend their money to credit-starved businesses and households instead. It is the first time a major central bank has imposed negative interest rates.

The ECB also cut its benchmark interest rate – affecting mortgages and business loans – from 0.25 per cent to a record low of 0.15 per cent. By contrast, the Bank of England yesterday left interest rates at 0.5 per cent, and is expected to start raising them in the next 12 months.

The dramatic move in the eurozone was part of a wider ECB attempt to stop low inflation turning into a  dangerous period of deflation.

Such an event – seen in Japan over the past two decades – can lead to a downward spiral of lower profits, falling wages and more unemployment.

Chris Williamson, chief economist at research group Markit, said: ‘While the Bank of England pulled no  surprises, the European Central Bank went further than expected, taking out a shotgun to hopefully kill off the threat of deflation.’

Negative interest rates have been used in Denmark and Sweden recently. Economist Howard Archer, of IHS Global Insight, called it ‘a bold and unusual move’, but added that there was ‘considerable uncertainty’ as to how effective negative rates would be.

The eurozone economy grew by 0.2 per cent in the first three months of 2014 compared to 0.8 per cent in the UK. Growth was driven by Germany, where output was up 0.8 per cent, but was held back by France.

Mr Williamson said France, dubbed ‘the sick man of Europe’, is ‘a major drag on the region’s revival’.

Eurozone inflation fell to 0.5 per cent, while unemployment remains high at 11.7 per cent. Mr Draghi warned: ‘We are now in a completely different world.’

He outlined a £325billion scheme to boost lending to small businesses and said the ECB could embark on a programme of quantitative easing, or money printing.

Carsten Brzeski, an economist at Dutch banking group ING, said: ‘Will it help to kick-start the economy? Probably not. The ECB has no  guarantee that the economy and lending to the private sector can really be kick-started.’

Nancy Curtin, of asset managers Close Brothers, said Draghi ‘didn’t disappoint, throwing in everything but the kitchen sink of QE’.
