Want to know how to entertain a cat with as little effort as possible?

Matt Groves from Dallas, Texas, has got the answer. 

He filmed the moment he kept his feline occupied with a laser pen. 

But playtime is abruptly interrupted when the cat chases the ray of light and runs headfirst into a door.

A woman can be heard laughing in the background as the scene unfolds. The pet appears to be okay as it stumbles away, seemingly in a state of shock.

Before the collision, footage shows Groves shining a beam of light around his living room with the kitty wildly chasing it around.

At one point the cat darts down a corridor and leaps half way up a door in a bid to catch the ray of light.

It then repeats the stunt on the other side of the room before hitting its head.
