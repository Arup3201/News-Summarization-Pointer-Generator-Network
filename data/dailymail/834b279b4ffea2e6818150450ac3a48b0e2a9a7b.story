With Halloween just a few weeks away, thoughts are turning to costume ideas.

If you're bored of dressing as a cat and tired of transforming yourself into a red devil, Millie Mackintosh has provided some garish inspiration.

The former Made In Chelsea star, who usually oozes glamour, is almost unrecognisable as she transforms herself into a terrifying zombie for a photoshoot - and she's shared the tricks behind achieving the look with FEMAIL.

Halloween inspiration? Former Made In Chelsea star Millie Mackintosh was transformed into one of the undead to help celebrate the imminent season five launch of The Walking Dead and now she's shared her tips for getting the look at home

'I usually enjoy looking glamorous so it was really fun to get into character as a zombie walker The Walking Dead TV show,' said Millie.

'People wouldn't expect me to get made up to look ugly so it was really fun to do.' 

The fashion designer has traded her usual glamorous look for blood and gore after uniting with NOW TV for the startling makeover, which saw her transformed into one of the undead, in anticipation of the new series.

With her face slathered in ghostly white foundation and smeared with fake blood, Millie, 25, a self-confessed fan of the hit show, posed for a series of fun shots. 

The painstaking steps involved in transforming the reality TV star took professional make-up artists more than three hours to complete - and the results were undeniably impressive. 

Startling: The process involved in transforming Millie took professional make-up artists more than three hours to achieve 

'This look is terrifying,' said Millie. 'I am a full-on zombie complete with wounds, hollow eyes and greasy hair.'

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Millie won't be sporting this look herself come October 31st.

'Last year Stephen and I went to Jonathan Ross' party as vampires but me and my girlfriends are going as the Spice Girls this year.

'I think I'll go as a zombified Ginger Spice because I'm strawberry blonde; I've already bought my Union Jack dress from eBay,' she said.

Recalling her most disastrous Halloween outfit, she said: 'One year I went as a zombie bride and everyone was wearing skimpy outfits. It was sort of a Lindsay Lohan in Mean Girls vibe. I just think the standard revealing outfit with fishnet tights isn't such a good look.'

Impressive: Millie, 25, a self confessed fan of The Walking Dead, traded her usually glamorous look for blood and gore 

Millie, who is married to London born grime star Professor Green, revealed that the rapper got her into boxsets - especially scary ones.

Just one year into married life, Professor Green has joked that TV box sets have already become the 'downfall' in he and Millie Mackintosh's 'sex life'.

The 30-year-old rapper, real name Stephen Maderson, revealed he and the former Made In Chelsea star enjoy nothing more than staying in for a quiet night in front of the box.

Speaking in an interview with heat magazine, the Lullaby rapper joked: 'Most of our relationship is driven by humour. All we do is take the p**s out of each other until one of us cries.

'That's been the downfall of our sex life, I think - box sets. We've done House Of Cards, Breaking Bad, 24, American Horror Story. We're doing Ray Donovan at the moment - it's f**king wicked.'

The Walking Dead has developed a cult following since its launch on American channel AMC with a tentative six episode run in 2010.

Starring British actor Andrew Lincoln – best known for his role as hapless lawyer Egg in This Life – the show follows a disparate group of survivors as they endeavour to exist in a world overrun by flesh hungry zombies.

The fifth season will launch on Fox on October 13, and fans can catch up on the first four  with a NOW: TV Entertainment Pass.

Season five is also available to watch on NOW: TV.

Special effects make-up artist Nicholas Thompson helped Millie, a former make-up artist herself, transform into a gruesome walker from the show for NOW TV.

'These simple tricks and techniques will help you achieve the look at home, with just a little practice and patience,' said Nicholas. 'Everything used within the tips can be found in a make-up bag or made with things that you can find at a supermarket or online.'

How to do it

Top tip: Ensure you aren’t allergic to any new products you might use by performing a patch test on

the wrist 24 hours before you begin

Step 1: Preparation

Massage some cleanser into the face to create a base. This will allow the skin to be moist and eases the removal at the end of the process

Pin back hair to see the full face and to stop stray hairs getting into the make-up

Step 2: Create cuts and scars

Use sculpt gel to create cuts and scars across the face

Apply the gel to the face, using a cuticle stick to move the gel around and create shapes – get creative and think about how your walker wound got there!

Don’t be too even. Nature doesn’t work in straight lines and symmetry is seen as traditionally beautiful so we want to avoid this!

Top tip: Sculpt gel can be bought online or within specialist make up shops. Porridge oats mixed with petroleum jelly make a great back up if you can’t find it

Greg’s tip: Think about what happened to the Walker for them to look like this and begin to tell a story through the make-up

Step 3: Dry the wounds

When you know where you want the wound, use a hair dryer on a low heat setting and work quickly to shape the cut using a cuticle stick

Getting ready: Massage some cleanser into the face to create a base. This will allow the skin to be moist and eases the removal at the end of the process

Step 4: Add dark shadows to the recesses of the face

Using a grease paint palette of just a few basic darker colours - you can get these from fancy dress shops or specialist make up stores - and a sponge or paint brush to apply

Add dark shadows under the eyes, temples and the nose. You want to really exaggerate where the natural shadow is for this

Top tip: Think of a skeleton’s face when doing this and try and mimic that look!

Step 5: Create a unifying base

Use a yellow grease paint and a sponge and blend it to create an even base tone

You can also highlight certain areas around the darker patches using complimentary colours to create a gaunt look

Top tip: Check out a colour wheel before you start to decide on which colours work best together

Step 6: Highlight wounds

Using light red colouring and a sponge, highlight the dried wound and make it standout

You can remove any excess with a wet wipe, but smudging and smears give a more authentic walker look – it shouldn’t look too perfect!

Top tip: Less is more here!

Final touches: Fill in the wounds with wound filler which you can get from specialist make up shops, dabbing it with a paint brush to build up in layers

Step 7: Exaggerate features

Go over the eyelids and lips with a purple or brown hue using a paintbrush to really exaggerate those features

You’re aiming here to give the areas a bruised look

Top tip: Stand further away from the mirror so you can see yourself overall rather than focussing on one area

Step 8: Fill the wounds

Fill in the wounds with wound filler which you can get from specialist make up shops, dabbing it with a paint brush to build up in layers

Highlight the highs and lows with a range of bruise tones, giving the wounds depth and a less uniform colour

You can go over the wounds with a fixing agent or talcum powder so the colour doesn’t run

Top tip: You can make your own wound filler by mixing seedless raspberry jam with cooking

glycerine

Step 9: Add blood

Paint fake blood on to the wounds to give it a more gory look

You can also flick the blood onto the face with a toothbrush for a more authentic splattered look

Greg’s tip: Think about how your Walker got their injury and use that to consider how you should apply the blood and where to. For example, a gunshot wound will look different to a cut

Step 10: Dress the hair

Apply a little conditioner and back comb the hair in sections

Spray with hairspray to achieve the messy look

Top tip: Finishing touches and accessories really make the look, so consider everything from your clothes to your hair in your overall presentation.
