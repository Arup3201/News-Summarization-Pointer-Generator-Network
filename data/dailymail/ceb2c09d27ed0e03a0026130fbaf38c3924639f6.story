Andy Murray made light work of Nick Kyrgios as he cruised into the third round of the Rogers Cup in Toronto with a 6-2 6-2 victory over the Australian.

Kyrgios produced his career highlight by knocking Rafael Nadal out of Wimbledon earlier in the summer but he was unable to dent Murray’s challenge in the Canadian capital.

Murray dominated the match with his serve, producing seven aces in the two sets to book a clash with Richard Gasquet in the next round.

It was Murray’s first match since failing to defend his Wimbledon title with a last-eight exit from the All England Club last month.

The 27-year-old British number one is on a Rogers Cup quarter-final collision course with Novak Djokovic should he progress in his debut hardcourt tournament of the season.

The event offers his main preparation before the US Open begins on August 25.
