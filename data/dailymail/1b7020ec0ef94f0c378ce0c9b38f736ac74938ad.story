Abbie Stocker, 25, has claimed she was told to stop breastfeeding her newborn son in a hospital waiting room by a nurse

A new mother claims she was asked by a nurse to move to a private room while breastfeeding her son in a hospital waiting room.

Abbie Stocker, 25, said she was left feeling ‘humiliated’ and ‘like a naughty schoolgirl’ as she sat breastfeeding ten-week-old Eric.

Mrs Stocker politely declined to leave. But after her son’s appointment with an eye consultant, she says she was forced to finish feeding her baby in a corridor.

The case comes at a time of national debate about breastfeeding in public after controversy over Lou Burns, who was told to cover herself and her baby with a napkin in Claridge’s, the exclusive Mayfair hotel.

Recalling the latest incident at Burnley Hospital, Mrs Stocker said: ‘There were about five other people in the waiting room with children and none of them seemed concerned.

‘It was clear that the staff were not happy with me breastfeeding in public. I was only offered the chance to return to the waiting room once Eric had finished his feed.

‘I felt humiliated, like a naughty schoolgirl who had been made to wait outside the headteacher’s office.’

Last week Ukip leader Nigel Farage stirred the controversy when he suggested mothers should be willing to ‘sit in the corner’ in restaurants when breastfeeding.

His comments in response to the incident at Claridge’s came under attack, with David Cameron saying it was ‘totally unacceptable’ to make mothers feel uncomfortable.

Women staged a public breastfeed outside the London hotel last week in protest at women being told to cover up. 

The new Equality Act states that it amounts to sex discrimination to treat a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding. 

The law applies to anyone providing services, facilities and premises to the public, public bodies,further and higher education bodies and association.

Women are protected  in public places such as parks, sports and leisure facilities, public buildings and when using public transport such as buses, trains and planes. 

They are protected in shops, pubs, restaurants and hotels regardless of how big or small. 

The law also applies in hospitals, theatres, cinemas and petrol stations.

Mrs Stocker, who is still breastfeeding her two-year-old daughter Millie, pointed out that the Equality Act states it is illegal to ask a breastfeeding woman to leave a public place.

She added: ‘This is not the first time I have experienced discrimination like this but to face it in a hospital that prides itself on promoting breastfeeding is unbelievable.

‘Breastfeeding reduces the mother’s risk of contracting ovarian and breast cancer and it also helps to protect the child from illnesses such as asthma and cancer.

‘I hope this will not discourage other mums because it is one of the best things you can do for your child.’ Last night the hospital said it welcomed breastfeeding mothers in all departments.

Anita Fleming, head of midwifery at East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: ‘It’s disappointing to hear that our offer of a room to allow Mrs Stocker privacy and comfort was misinterpreted on this occasion and we are sorry for any upset.’
