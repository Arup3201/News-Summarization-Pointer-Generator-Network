Second homeowners who fail to pay their taxes could face crippling fines or even jail under a major crackdown launched yesterday by HM Revenue and Customs.

Tax collectors are targeting thousands of people who have sold a second home, a holiday home or a buy-to-let property without paying tax, even if it was up to 20 years ago.

Anybody who has sold a second property in the UK or overseas will have to pay capital gains tax on the money they made from the sale.

If they fail to do so, they could face huge fines and even jail under the new plans.

The move will give rise to accusations that HMRC is penalising ordinary, hard-working families when they should be tackling tax avoidance by corporate giants who make huge profits but pay little or no tax in this country.

Under the current rules, you are allowed to sell your home without paying a penny in tax, but the rules are different if you own more than one property.

For example, a family with their main home in London and a cottage on the Cornish coast must pay capital gains tax on any profit from the sale of their country retreat.

Under the tax amnesty, HMRC is urging people who should have paid tax - but failed to do so - to come forward over the next five months. 

The deadline is August 9.

If they do not, they could face penalties worth up to 100 per cent of the capital gains tax bill which they did not pay on the sale on top of the actual bill.

Marian Wilson, head of HMRC campaigns, said: ‘It is better to come to us before we come to you’, and warned people face ‘penalties or even criminal prosecution’ if they do not.

Tax evasion is estimated to cost the British economy around £14billion a year. 

In the most extreme cases, people found guilty could be sent to jail.

The crackdown will worry hundreds of thousands of Britons, many of whom may not even know that they should have paid tax on the sale of a second home.

And the bill will not be small, given the house price rises over the last 20 years.

Official figures, from the Land Registry, show how house prices in the most popular locations for second homes, such as Cornwall and Devon, have risen sharply.

In 1998, the average home in Cornwall was worth £61,000. Fifteen years later, the same property has trebled in value to £180,000.

Capital gains tax is currently charged at up to 28 per cent on any profit over £10,600, the amount of profit which can be made every year before the tax will be charged.

But they will be liable to pay the tax at the rate which was levied in the year they sold the property. The levy has been as high as 40 per cent.

Overall, around 619,000 families have a second home, with some owning more than one extra home. Of the total of 711,000 second homes, 343,000 are in the UK and 368,000 are outside the UK.

The most popular place to have a second home is Cornwall which has around 14,560 second homeowners, followed by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in London with 7,474.

Around 84,000 people have a second home in France and around 88,000 in Spain, according to the Department for Communities and Local Government.

Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Rather than spending its time announcing yet another crackdown, HMRC should focus on the underlying problem that is Britain’s dysfunctional tax code.

‘Capital gains tax is a deeply unfair charge which targets some people just because a home has gone up in value with inflation.

‘If our tax system was reformed to make it simpler and fairer then the taxman wouldn’t have to spend so much time and money trying to chase down those not sure of the rules as well as finding it easier to pursue those who deliberately break them.’
