NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell addressed one the main topics of conversation heading into Super Bowl week in a news conference on Thursday - the deflated footballs used by the New England Patriots in the AFC championship game.

'Whether a competitive advantage was actually gained or not is secondary in my mind to whether that rule was violated,' said Goodell, who noted a resolution would not come until after the Super Bowl.

He then added; 'We don't know enough in this investigation to know who was responsible or whether there was even an infraction.'

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a news conference for NFL Super Bowl XLIX football game on Friday that Deflategate would not be addressed until after Sunday's game

Patriots owner Robert Kraft has said he expects the investigation to determine his team did nothing wrong — and he expects an apology from the NFL. 

Kraft did not attend Friday's news conference. 

Goodell also described his league — and himself — as having addressed missteps on difficult matters such as domestic violence and being ready to move on.

'As an organization, and as an individual, it's been a tough year,' said Goodell, 'but a year of great progress, and I'm excited about the future.'

Nearing the end of a season he acknowledged was filled with 'plenty of challenges.'

Goodell was also asked whether he thought he deserved a pay cut and said; 'That's up to the owners.'

Asb for whether or not he bleives he should be fiored, he said; 'No, I can't. Does that surprise you?'

Goodell brushed aside a question about whether there are conflict-of-interest problems with paying those who head up independen" investigations, such as into the league's handling of the Ray Rice case or the ongoing look at the New England Patriots' use of deflated footballs in the AFC title game.

'We have had people who have had uncompromising integrity' run those inquiries, Goodell said. 

Then, speaking directly to the reporter, he added: 'Somebody has to pay them ... unless you're volunteering, which I don't think you are.'

Rice is the former Baltimore Ravens running back who punched his now-wife in an elevator, drawing an initial suspension from Goodell of two games. 

Goodell also said the league was improving, despite numerous scandals involving domestic abuse and assault this year

Goodell changed that to an indefinite ban after video from inside the elevator was posted by TMZ. Rice later appealed, and an arbitrator reinstated him.

That and other domestic violence cases led the league to design a new personal conduct policy, which was approved unanimously by owners but has been criticized by the players' union.

'We've made enormous progress," Goodell said Friday. 

'We're in a good place.' 

Another issue that won't be resolved until after the season's final game, Goodell said, is whether Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch will be fined for refusing to answer any questions at required media sessions this week. The NFL docked Lynch $100,000 earlier this season for not talking to reporters.

'I understand it may not be on the top of his list,' Goodell said.

'But everyone else is cooperating, everyone else is doing their part.'
