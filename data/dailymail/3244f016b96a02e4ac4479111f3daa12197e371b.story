A pub once dubbed a 'smokey local boozer' has become the best pub in Britain, turning itself around in just 11 years.

The Cock in Hemingford Grey, Cambridgeshire, has bagged the top spot in the 2013 Good Pub Guide after receiving hundreds of good reviews from regulars.

The guide praised the traditional pub and its top restaurant, saying: 'Getting rave reviews from our army of reader-reporters, the Cock offers the best for all its customers.

chef Barry Greenshields and general manager Tim Prior

'This well-run, pretty pub is just 
the sort of place that pub-lovers return to again and again as it 
cleverly manages to appeal to both drinkers and diners.'

Oliver
Thain, 40, the Cock's 
co-licensee with chef Richard Bradley, 42, described the pub as a 
'smokey local village boozer' when the pair took it over in 2001.

He
said: 'It was just that. I'm not saying it was poor, it was just the 
sort of pub that needed investment and it was the only pub in the 
village.

'You 
literally walked in and it was filled with smoke. But we've kept the 
local pub, we've kept the restaurant separate and we don't do any food 
in the pub so it keeps that local pub feel.'

Father-of-three Mr Thain said the pub's 'warm welcome' was its biggest asset.

welcome: The owners Oliver and Richard say the pub's warm welcome is

He said: 'People often say it is like walking 
into a second home.'

Former area manager for Scottish and Newcastle pub company Mr Thain jumped at the chance to snap up the pub when it came on the market, and knew the area well after growing up nearby.

He decided to team up with Mr 
Bradley, also a father-of-three, who was working as head-chef at the 
Anchor at Sutton Gault, Cambridgeshire at the time, after meeting him at a
wedding. 

The pair now have five pubs and a catering company to their name - although they describe The Cock as their 'baby'.

Mr
Thain said: 'It's a lovely village, right on the banks of the River 
Great Ouse. It's quite well to do, but there's a good mixture of 
housing. We were pretty busy from day one, I think it was needed in the 
village.

The Fat Cat in Norwich won the Beer Pub of the Year accolade, with reviewers describing a visit to the pub as 'a bit like coming to a private beer festival.'

Outside Loo of the Year award - introduced for the first time this year - went to the Tram Inn at Eardisley, Herefordshire.

The prestigious Good Pub Guide lists 4,700 
pubs, including more than 250 new entries despite years of closures amid
the increasing price of a pint.

Researchers found that pub landlords are more upbeat about their prospects as increasing numbers of people go to their local rather than a restaurant for a meal, according to a new report.

It said there were clear signs of a turn-around.

Co-editor Fiona Stapley said: 'Most strikingly, the mood among publicans themselves is changing.

'Although it is extremely hard work, for the first time in over 10 years most landlords and landladies have been more upbeat.

'People are choosing to spend 
weekends away in country pubs and customers like to eat out in pubs as 
opposed to restaurants because the atmosphere is more informal - and the
food is just as good, if not better.'

Guide authors said that in England, 
the North/South divide is stark, with the price of a pint of beer in 
Surrey and London around £3.50, but in the Midlands and the North, pints
average under £3.

Staffordshire had the best value pint, where pubs charge an average of £2.56.

In addition, researchers said they had received fewer complaints from readers about service and more and more pubs were welcoming dogs.

Many pubs have been looking at new ways to draw in customers during the recession, including opening earlier, with more serving morning coffee and even breakfasts.

A handful of pubs have turned their hand to serving other goods, including jams, chutneys and sometimes bread.

The guide said: 'Other pubs are branching out in different ways' a new venture is the pub cooking class or demonstration letting pub chefs show their fined honed skills, and pubs are starting to make something of a specialty of their cream teas.'
