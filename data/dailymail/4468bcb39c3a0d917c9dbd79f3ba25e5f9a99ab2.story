Jenson Button has revealed he held an 'interesting and encouraging' conversation with Ron Dennis about the future direction of McLaren at the weekend.

Button's personal future has been in the spotlight of late as McLaren Group chairman and CEO Dennis has yet to make a decision with regard to a driver line-up for next year.

McLaren have been linked with moves to Fernando Alonso and Sebastian Vettel, whilst Dennis even suggested over the weekend he was keeping a close eye on the situation at Mercedes and the battle between Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton.

With Button out of contract at the end of this year, it means the 34-year-old is in limbo, although Dennis has promised a decision will be made by the final grand prix in Abu Dhabi in late November.

Promisingly for Button, he has confirmed he 'spent a lot of time with Ron' over the course of the Italian Grand Prix weekend.

Button said: 'Forgetting the driver situation with Kevin (Magnussen) and myself, it was good to talk about the future of the team, the direction it is going and how it is performing.

'It was all interesting and encouraging, which comes on the back of the last couple of races in particular which have been good in terms of atmosphere within the team.

'That's not just with Ron and the drivers, but the rest of the management and the direction the team is going and the improvements being made. There's a nice feel about the place at the moment.

'Last year was tough, the start of this year was tough, but now there is more direction in terms of understanding the future of the team.

'That's in terms of the people within it, the design of the car, who is in charge, so for me and everyone within the team, it gives us a lot more confidence in the future here.'

With Dennis opening up to Button in such a way, it would appear to point to the veteran being retained.

Dennis did make clear at the weekend he did not know yet who would be in the car in 2015, so for now Button is just sitting tight and driving his heart out.

'I am not scared and I have no fears of not being on the grid next year,' added Button.

'But I want to drive, this is what I love, especially these last few races because even though they have not been the results I wanted, I have loved giving it my all.

'I am here enjoying myself, trying to get the best out of myself and the car, and I feel I have done a good job, so I am happy with that.

'Of course, Ron knows and understands I want to stay, and he knows by the way I drive I am not holding back. He is an intelligent guy.'
