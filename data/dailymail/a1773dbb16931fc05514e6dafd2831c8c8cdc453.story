A homeless handyman from Florida has been arrested and charged with the killing of an 85-year-old widow who was discovered dead inside her home by her daughter and son-in-law.

Ronald Citarelli, 49, was taken into custody Tuesday on charges of first-degree murder and burglary in connection to the death of Barbara Minardi in Deltona, Florida.

Also on Tuesday the Volusia County Sheriff's Office released the heart-breaking 911 call placed by Miss Minardi's son-in-law after he and his wife discovered the elderly woman dead inside her home on Omaha Driver just before 9pm Monday.

Shocking discovery: Minardi's daughter and son-in-law came by her house on Omaha Drive Monday evening to check up on her, only to find the octogenarian dead from blunt-force trauma

Gut-wrenching call: Don Callison, Minardi's son-in-law , called 911 to report the murder as his hysterical wife (pictured right) wailed in the background

On the call, Barbara Minardi's daughter, Cindy Callison, could be heard wailing and sobbing uncontrollably while her husband, Don, tries to give information to the emergency dispatcher, reported WKMG.

Struggling to keep his composure, Mr Callison tells the female 911 operator that he and his wife stopped by Barbara Minardi's home at around 8.45pm to check up on her after failing to reach her by phone all the day.

The house was locked and there was no light inside, but the blinds were open. The Callisons also noticed that Minardi's Nissan was gone from her driveway.

When the couple entered the house, Cindy Callison, a registered nurse, discovered her mother's lifeless body.

When asked by the emergency dispatcher if CPR might help, Don Callison said that his mother-in-law was dead but asked her to send a paramedic for his hysterical wife who suffers from a heart condition.

It is believed that the octogenarian, who had spent 13 years volunteering with the sheriff's office, died from blunt-force trauma. An autopsy will be performed to determine the exact cause of death.

Busted: Citarelli, a homeless handyman, was picked up by police just hours after the killing when the victim's stolen car was spotted next to his acquaintances' home 7 miles away from the crime scene

About three hours later, Ronald Citarelli was apprehended by deputies acting on a tip about a sighting of Barbara Minardi's stolen car just 7 miles from the crime scene.

The 2010 grey Nissan Altima was found parked outside a house on Comstock Drive belonging to Citarelli's acquaintances.

Officers set up a stakeout outside the residence and collared Citarelli as he was leaving the house on foot. They also recovered some stolen property connecting him to Minardi’s killing.

According to investigators, Ronald Citarelli knew Barbara Minardi because he had recently installed flooring in her home.

Volusia County Sheriff Ben Johnson had some harsh words for the man suspected of killing the woman he described as the unsung hero of the department who never sought any credit for her hard work.

‘I think he should get the chair. Of course we don't have that anymore, but he should get the death penalty. He deserves the death penalty,’ Johnson told WFTV.

According to the woman's grieving family, Barbara Minardi had been living alone since 1999, when her husband lost his battle with cancer.

Despite her advanced age, the retiree was independent and active, joining social clubs and enjoying spending time with friends and family, reported The Daytona Beach News-Journal.

To keep herself busy, in 2001 Minardi joined the sheriff's office in Deltona as a volunteer, doing filing work, answering phones and putting together DNA kits.

Targeted: Citarelli was familiar with Minardi and knew the widow was living alone because he had installed her flooring recently 

Cindy and Don Callison were shocked to learn that Ronald Citarelli, whom they described as a pleasant 'smooth talker,' has been charged with the murder.

Mrs Callison recalled how one time Citarelli showed up to do work on her mother's floors with two women in tow - one of them pregnant - whom he introduced as his sisters.

The elderly homeowner even donated some furniture to the expectant mother, Cindy Callison said.

Mrs Minardi is survived by four grown children, nine grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.
