Photographer Annie Leibovitz has finally sold her massive townhouse in Manhattan's West Village for $28.5million.

'It is a good price, consistent with other big homes that have sold in the neighborhood — which is hot,' a broker told Page Six today of Ms Leibovitz's sale.

The compound of three separate townhouses had been relisted in April at $29million, down from $33million when it originally hit the market last December.

Photographers lair: Ms Leibovitz was forced to cut the price of her West Village home, which she lived in for a decade, by $4million to $29million after no buyers came forward

Million dollar mansion: Ms Leibovitz's old compound, which she sold for $28.5million in January 2014, is composed of three separate townhouses - one for living, one for office  space and one as guest quarters

The home's buyer appears to have hidden their identity behind an LLC called 755 Greenwich LLC - befittingly the address of the property.

A labor of love, Ms Leibovitz, 63, 
created the 10,200 square-foot compound over a decade ago after purchasing the three buildings for $6.1million, and 
gut-renovating them.

She used one for living, one for office space and one as guest quarters. The trio of properties all surround a slate patio and private courtyard garden.

The brick buildings, which Ms Leibovitz began assembling in 2002, date back to the 1830s, and include a total of seven bedrooms, five-and-a-half bathrooms, and 13 fireplaces in all.

Touching upon Ms Leibovitz's recent financial troubles that almost laded her in bankruptcy, a source told Page Six: 'This deal is another step toward her financial recovery. It is another step in the right direction.'

However in 2009, she
 was sued over a dispute over the terms of a loan repayment that 
involved her townhouses and photo archives, which creditors claimed she 
had put up as collateral, and saw her narrowly miss having to file for 
bankruptcy.

A breach of 
contract lawsuit was filed against Ms Leibovitz by Art Capital Group for
 $24 million regarding the repayment of a $15.5million loan that she 
took after experiencing multiple financial challenges.

In a short matter of time Ms Leibovitz lost
 her
 father, mother, and her long-time partner, Susan Sontag, while 
simultaneously welcoming twins into her family, and bankrolling the 
renovation of her three 
West Village properties.

However
 Art Capital Group withdrew its lawsuit against Ms Leibovitz a few 
months later in 2009 and extended the due date for repayment of the $24 
million loan.

The compound's sale would likely cover a majority of what Ms Leibovitz still must repay.

'It’s a big step on her road to financial recovery,' a source said. 'She waited long enough and made a really good deal.'

Under the agreement with Art Capital Group, Ms Leibovitz 
continues to retain control over her work, and is still the 'exclusive 
agent in the sale of her real property (land) and copyrights.'

According to multiple sources, Ms Leibovitz plans to move uptown to be closer to the school of her three
 daughters - Sarah Cameron Leibovitz who was born in 2001, and her twin 
girls, Susan and Samuelle, who were born to a surrogate mother in 2005.

Once moved in, her home's new owners will be privvy to the property's wide-plank wood floors, which are offset by high ceilings. There is also a formal dining room and chef's kitchen.

One of the buildings includes a photographer's studio and a large reception room.

Listing broker Paula Del Nunzio, of Brown Harris Stevens said: 'It's very rare to have something like this. She created it.'
