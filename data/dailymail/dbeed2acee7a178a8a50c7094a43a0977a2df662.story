Disgraced Co-op Bank chairman Paul Flowers is alleged to have secretly asked his regular dealer for cocaine just two days after he publicly pledged to seek ‘professional help’ for his drug abuse, The Mail on Sunday has learned.

On Tuesday, while in hiding from the media, he contacted drug dealer Peter Wilson – who Flowers gave £300 to in the extraordinary video we published last week. Later in a telephone conversation he allegedly asked for more drugs.

The suspended Methodist minister had made a contrite statement through the church last Sunday – apologising for ‘stupid and wrong’ actions in buying crack cocaine and other drugs.

Despite telling the Mail on Sunday he was seeking help for his addiction, Reverend Paul Flowers contacted his dealer two days later allegedly asking for more drugs

His vow was prompted by our world exclusive story last week. But shocking new evidence shows his appetite is apparently as rapacious as ever.

Inviting Wilson, 35, a convicted drug dealer whose name we have changed, to stay with him at his Liverpool ‘safe house’, Flowers said: ‘So .  .  . just er, turn up, and if you want to bring the boy Charlie, that’s fine too.’

Leeds-based Wilson, who taped the call which Mail on Sunday reporters have heard and verified, confirmed that they have no mutual friends called Charlie, and other texts we publish today show it was Flowers’s habitual term for cocaine.

‘I had absolutely no doubt Paul was referring to coke,’ Wilson told The Mail on Sunday last night. ‘He always used that word for it.

‘A bit earlier in the conversation, I asked him if it would be OK to smoke a spliff at the house – which belongs to another Methodist minister friend of his – and Paul said that would be fine as long as I did it in the garden.

How the story broke last Sunday

‘But he only mentioned “Charlie” right at the end of the conversation, trying to make it sound like a casual aside, but we both knew what he was talking about and I certainly don’t know anyone called Charlie.’

Flowers told Wilson he had been using drugs since 2010, which would include nearly all of his spell at the Co-op Bank – and also astonished him by saying he didn’t believe in God.

Wilson said: ‘He told me that he has been doing drugs for three years, so how much attention he ever paid to his business at the bank is anyone’s guess. I know how much all these drugs affect your mental powers and concentration.’

He went on: ‘I only found out he was a reverend when I saw his picture online with a dog collar. He never mentioned it. In fact, he told me that he didn’t believe in God.

‘The other thing that amazes me is that he was a trustee on the board of the Terrence Higgins Trust but he never practises safe sex.

'He never wears a condom. It was even more staggering that he told me his brother had died of AIDS aged 39.’

The day after The Mail on Sunday’s revelations last week, the Terrence Higgins Trust, Britain’s biggest HIV charity, announced Flowers’s resignation from the post after two years.

Added Wilson: ‘Paul’s been a really heavy user of coke and ketamine for a long time. Recently other drugs too, and whatever he said in his statement, it’s not going to be easy for him to come off them just because he’s been publicly exposed.

‘I laughed when I saw his statement saying he was getting professional help – the only professional help he was seeking was from a professional drug fixer – me.’

In a taped telephone conversation later on Tuesday, Flowers told Peter – after he had changed his mind about the invitation to Liverpool – they could have a ‘couple of nights away’ and suggested Manchester.

Flowers said: ‘We can’t go abroad, I don’t think, but we could find somewhere either quiet, or somewhere very busy. We could go to Manchester if you like.’

Flowers was staying with Reverend Hu, an ex-addict minister who has spoken about his battles with drugs and alcohol and has a house in the city

Wilson pointed out to Flowers that with the media storm, he would soon be spotted, and asked if he thought that a good idea.

Flowers’s reply gave an indication of the supreme arrogance which has been at the root of his downfall: ‘Yep. I do. I think one should be brazen in certain circumstances’.

The pair first met two months ago through a gay app called Scruff, said Peter. ‘He messaged me saying, “Do you want to come to a party and sniff some coke?”’

Ex-con Wilson became Flowers’s regular dealer. ‘Not only did I get to sell him the drugs, I also got to use them for nothing afterwards,’ he said.

‘On Remembrance Sunday, Flowers left the house in the morning to go and conduct the service in Bradford.

‘We had been up most of the night but that didn’t stop him laying out a great fat line of coke in the morning, which he sniffed up before he left.

‘I did get worried about him sometimes because his coke habit was massive. He took huge quantities of it, and he’s 63 years old and clearly overweight.

‘He’s really pushing his luck, especially combining it with ketamine, crack and GHB.’

The Mail on Sunday put all the allegations in our stories today to the Rev Flowers’s solicitor, former chairman of Leeds North East Labour Party Andy Hollas last night.

Mr Hollas said: ‘I cannot comment on any of these allegations, save to say I find it utterly fanciful and they smack of the kind of contrived nonsense that has been mentioned about my client. 

‘If he has a comment to make I’m sure he’ll contact me and make an appropriate statement, but at the moment, police enquiries are ongoing and you’ll appreciate that I’m not saying anything.’
