A professional dancer who had part of her leg amputated after being injured in the Boston bombings is to appear on Dancing With The Stars.

Adrianne Haslet, who has become a symbol of American resilience after the attacks, said she is 'honored' to make a guest appearance on the show.

Details of her guest appearance and role on the primetime dance competition are yet to be revealed.

But the ballroom dancer - who is said to be a fan of the programme- said 'dancing is my life' and vowed to start training as soon as possible.

Haslet takes her first tentative steps towards recovery. The professional ballroom dancer is said to be a fan of DWTS and counts Derek Hough as her favourite professional performer

DWTS host Tom Bergeron last night promised viewers that Mrs Haslet will appear in next week's episode.

He said: 'We were all very moved by her inspirational outlook. We’ll tell you how we hope to be part of her recovery'.

Mrs Haslet messaged a friend saying 'OHMUGOD!!!!!!!!! I loooove Derek!!!!!!' when she learned that DWTS favourite Derek Hough wants to dance with her.

Hough told the Boston Herald: 'It’s 
hard for anyone to really quite understand what she must be going 
through and what she’s going to go through with rehab and getting her 
balance back'

'But if she 
has the determination and she has the passion — and it sounds like she 
does — she’s going to run that marathon and she’s going to be dancing 
again. It’s not going to slow her down.'

Adrianne 
Haslet has become the face of a host of amputees who are struggling to recover from the Boston bombings.

Beth Roche wakes up knowing she can’t feel sorry for herself, that she has to focus on rehabbing her ravaged left leg.

But despite life-changing injuries, 
both women have vowed that the Boston Marathon bombings that killed 
three people and left them among the ranks of more than 260 injured will
 not define their lives.

Parts of them may be broken, but both patients at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital said in separate interviews yesterday that their spirits are intact and their thoughts are positive.

'I absolutely want to dance again and I also want to run the marathon next year,' said Haslet. 'I will crawl across the finish line, literally crawl, if it means I finish it.'

Roche, a 59-year-old medical office manager from Highland, Ind., who ran Chicago’s marathon last year, said she’s concentrating on more than just walking again.

'I want to do another marathon by the time I’m 65,' she said.

Roche said the first bomb at the 
marathon peeled her leg open “like a sardine can.” It happened right 
after she saw her daughter, Rebecca Roche, a 33-year-old Boston 
pharmacist, cross the race’s finish line.

The mother has had one surgery in which doctors implanted pins and plates in her leg, and has another surgery in her future.

The
 first blast left bones poking out of her leg, and made her unable to 
run for cover. She said a first responder tried to shield her as the 
second bomb exploded.

Roche 
ended up at Tufts Medical Center, and begged staffers before she went 
into surgery to find her family and let them know she was alive.

The blast from the second explosion knocked Haslet off her feet from about four feet away.

The
 Boston woman, an Arthur Murray Dance Studio employee, thought she was 
going to die when she looked down and saw how her body had been 
mutilated.

She’s had one surgery to amputate her left foot, and another in which doctors amputated more of the same leg below her knee.

In the hours before terror struck 
Boylston Street, Haslet was basking in the joy of having her husband 
home again. Two weeks earlier, the Air Force captain had returned from a
 four-month deployment in Afghanistan.

On
 Patriots’ Day morning, they were walking near the marathon’s finish 
line when the second explosion left them tangled in a heap on the ground
 and Haslet saw something was wrong with her foot.

'I remember thinking, "That’s so gross," and being terrified that this is the moment I was going to die,' she said.

Haslet
 crawled toward a restaurant door, before someone dragged her toward a 
staircase. Her husband, although also injured, took off his belt to make
 a tourniquet for her. Then others arrived to help and soon she was in a
 triage area where someone wrote a number on her forehead.

'I just prayed that I had a number that was high enough to get help,' she said. 'I just kept screaming out, "I’m a ballroom dancer! I’m a ballroom dancer! Just save my foot"'

The next day, she woke up at Boston Medical Center and saw her mother.

'I told my mom "My foot feels like it’s asleep." And she said, "Adrianne, you don’t have a foot anymore.”'

Nine days after the attack, neither Haslet nor Roche has thought much about the Russian-born brothers, one dead, one alive, whom authorities said are responsible for the attack.

As she recovers, Haslet said she trusts law-enforcement officials will do what’s best.

She’s hoping to get a prosthetic device in the next two months.

Roche cannot bend her left leg, as a grid of metal rods that’s meant to help her heal protrudes into it.

She said she isn’t sure if authorities should seek the death penalty for the remaining bombing suspect, but says everyone should move forward without fear.

'If we’re afraid, the enemy wins,' she said.
