It is a unique musical duet - a piano piece for two players, with one played by a hologram.

Japanese pianist Yoshiki performed the groundbreaking piece in Austin at the SXSW Festival.

To gasps from the audience, the holographic performer appeared first - and introduced the real performer.

Although the team have refused to reveal any details of the hologram, it is believed it was created using an updated version of an illusion known as 'Pepper's ghost'.

The same technique was used used at Coachella to 'resurrect' slain rapper Tupac.

That hologram effect was created using a system developed by London-based Musion, which employs an advanced version of Pepper's Ghost to great effect.

While the traditional illusion uses light partially reflected off a pane of glass, Musion's version involves a custom-developed foil to create more believable images.

'Yoshiki unveiled a never before seen classical concert performance at FLAUNT Magazine's party celebrating its upcoming List Issuem,' the musician said on his YouTube page.

'Yoshiki mesmerized the audience at Austin's Qui as he performed a piano duel with a hologram of himself, resulting in a passionate and dramatic musical experience celebrating the artistry of the multi-talented, classically trained musician.'

The musician has been experimenting with holograms for several years, long before the technology was used by more mainstream artists.

It was most famously used in 20012 at the Coachella festival where Snoop Dogg and Dr Dre brought back late rapper Tupac Shakur for their headline performance.

Snoop was joined by a life-size hologram of Tupac who stunned the crowd of 75,000 fans when he appeared onstage.

The bare-chested Tupac - who was dressed in sagging jeans and Timberland boots circa 1995, just like ones he wore around the time he was shot dead on September 13, 1996, aged 25.

He greeted the roaring crowd saying:' What's up Coachella?' - a festival that wasn't even taking place at the time of his death - before joining Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre on hit single Hail Mary.

Shakur also joined Snoop for song Gangsta Party stalking around the stage in his trademark style.

Both performances are believed to have been created using an updated version of an illusion known as 'Pepper's ghost'.

The same technique was used used at Coachella to 'resurrect' slain rapper Tupac.
