Honeymoon murder suspect Shrien Dewani has lost his High Court bid to block his extradition to South Africa until he is fit to stand trial for allegedly organising his wife's murder.

A panel of three judges, headed by Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, ruled today that it would not be 'unjust and oppressive' to force him to leave Britain.

They said this was on the basis that the South African authorities agreed to send him back to the UK swiftly if he is found unfit to stand trial, which has been agreed to.

Dewani, who is compulsorily detained in 
hospital under the Mental Health Act, is accused of ordering the killing
 of his new wife Anni, 28, who was shot as the couple travelled in a 
taxi on the outskirts of Cape Town in November 2010.

Today Anni's family welcomed the ruling but it is understood Shrien could launch one final appeal to the Supreme Court to stop the extradition.

Court case: Shrien Dewani has been fighting extradition to South Africa where he has been accused of having his wife Anni murdered in 2010

Dewani, from Bristol, has been fighting removal from the UK to face proceedings over wife Anni's death until he has recovered from mental health problems, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.

His lawyers have stressed at various hearings that he will be willing to defend himself at trial once he is fit to do so, but they say he is unfit to plead under English law and his 'prognosis is not certain'.

So far three men have been convicted over Mrs Dewani's death.

South African Xolile Mngeni was convicted of premeditated murder for shooting her. Prosecutors claimed he was a hitman hired by Dewani to kill his wife, which Dewani has consistently denied.

Taxi driver Zola Tongo was jailed for 18 years after he admitted his part in the killing and another accomplice, Mziwamadoda Qwabe, also pleaded guilty to murder and was handed a 25-year prison sentence.

Anni’s father Vinod, fighting back tears, said today: 'Since she was taken from us, life has been practically unbearable. I don’t know how we have managed to carry on.

'But the fact that we need Dewani to explain what happened on the night she was murdered has driven us each and every hour.

'I feel no joy whatsoever at today’s decision. But I do thank the judges and the British courts for being absolutely fair and proper in considering all the details'.

Mr Hindocha, speaking from his home in Mariestad,Sweden, added: 'I have said all along that I will be happy to go to South Africa with my arm around Shirien’s shoulder and support him.

'If he is innocent, I will accept that.'

The judges were asked to decide 
whether a person who is unfit to plead is 'an accused' for the purpose 
of the Extradition Act 2003 'if he is being extradited in circumstances 
where he may remain unfit to plead'.

They
 were also asked to rule on whether it was 'unjust or oppressive to 
extradite a person who is agreed at the time of the determination to be 
unfit, whatever the prognosis'.

Dewani's family have said that he remains committed to returning to South Africa 'when his health would permit a full trial and when appropriate protections are in place for his health and safety'.

A lawyer for the South African government said it was 'delighted' with the court's ruling and expected it would be able to give the undertaking, but needed 14 days 'for final clarification'.

Lord Thomas said: 'It might be unjust and oppressive to order the return of a person who was agreed to be currently unfit and where there was a prospect that he might remain permanently unfit without considering whether an undertaking should be required from the requesting state.'

He added: 'The circumstances of this case are such that we consider, on the findings made by the district judge, it would be unjust and oppressive to return him without such an undertaking.'

The effect of the undertaking would be that 'in the event of the appellant (Dewani) being found unfit to be tried, he will be free to return to the UK, unless there is found to be a realistic prospect of his being tried with a year - or other stated reasonable period - of that finding and the trial takes place within the period'.

Lord Thomas continued: 'In any event the appellant must be free to return in the event a court in South Africa, having found him unfit to be tried, embarked on the process of determining under the Criminal Procedure Act 1977 whether he did the act.'

He concluded: 'If such an undertaking was given, then it would not be oppressive or unjust.'

Amit Karia, a first cousin to Anni, said on behalf of family members at London's High Court: 'We are happy with the judgment. We have waited for it for three years, three months.'

He said: 'It seems a step closer to finally getting justice for our Anni.'

But he warned there was still a possibility that Dewani could launch a last-ditch appeal over today's ruling to the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land.

Mr Karia said: 'We are always worried and don't take anything for granted.'

He described the situation for Anni's parents as 'immensely difficult - they do not have normal life any more.'

He added: 'They just want the truth - that is all we have ever wanted.'
