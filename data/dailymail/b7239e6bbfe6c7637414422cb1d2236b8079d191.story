Eight-year-old Isabel Krige stayed up till 10pm baking cupcakes for SES searchers who are searching for toddler William Tyrell in northern NSW

An eight-year-old girl has penned a handwritten letter and baked cupcakes for the  volunteers who have been combing the bush for missing toddler William Tyrell.

The letter written by Isabel Krige was read to the volunteer State Emergency Services on Thursday night as rescue teams debriefed after the seventh long day searching for the three-year-old on the NSW mid north coast.

'Dear SES I made these cupcakes for you to show your great courage of never giving up hope,' wrote eight-year-old Isabel.

It was read out by State Emergency Service unit controller Paul Burg to assure the search teams they were doing a good job.

A week after three-year-old William disappeared from his grandmother's house in Kendall, on the New South Wales mid-north coast, police have started focussing on the likelihood he was picked up by a car in the absence of any other clues.

The community has been completely shaken by the tragedy, with parents keeping a close watch on their children and residents trying to come to grips with the fact that something sinister may have happened in their small town.

Isabel, from nearby Bonny Hills, stayed up until 10pm in order to bake the cupcakes because she was determined to help the SES searchers in any way she could.

'I thought it would be good to give them something because it's such a little community doing something for a three-year-old boy,' she said.

'I'm doing something for them and that will give them energy to do something for someone else, so it sort of goes along.' 

Three year-old William Tyrell was playing outside his grandmother's house  in Kendall on the NSW mid north coast when he was last seen a week ago

Isabel, like everyone else in the community, is completely baffled by William's disappearance.

'I really don't know because he's got a front yard and he was playing with his sister and I don't know if someone came in and stole him or he just went to the back of the bush,' she said.

'I hope they find that three-year-old boy because I'd be really scared, I'd probably be tucked up near a rock.'

On Sunday Isabel went out to the bush with her parents and sister to help the search.

David Hughes, acting principal at St Joseph's Primary School in Laurieton where Isabel goes to school, said the playground had been full of chatter and rumours about William's disappearance.

'Our main business has just been to suppress any fears for the kids in the school environment,' he said.

'You know they see police cars driving around and they've visited schools here just asking question about strangers, just covering all the angles.

'Basically what we're doing here is just trying to keep a lid on the gossip and the stories that are flying around a small community, so just trying to keep the fear level down I suppose and make sure the kids are safe.'

Isabel wanted to help the people searching for William and thought her cupcakes would give them energy to find the missing toddler

Superintendent Paul Fehon said William's family were struggling with the fact that there were still no leads in relation to his whereabouts.

'Of course, being a week from when young William went missing, it's emotionally distressing for them,' he said.

'They are doing it very tough.'

About 70 volunteers, State Emergency Service crews and police will continue searching roadsides in the nearby Middle Brother State Forest for evidence as they focus on the possibility William was picked up by a car.

More than 200 volunteers and residents have scoured kilometres of bush surrounding the property in the seven days since he disappeared.

'It's emotionally distressing for them': Police say the search for William has taken a huge toll on his family

A number of leads into William's disappearance have uncovered no trace of the missing three year old

A special task force was set up on the fifth day of William's disappearance

A number of tips, including reports that a 'well-dressed, well-spoken' man stopped at a local shop on Friday morning to ask directions to Batar Creek Road, which leads to Benaroon Drive where William was last seen, have uncovered nothing.

Forensic tests performed on a patch of blood found near a creek just over 2km from William's grandmother's house were also negative. Test results showed it was not human blood. 

Bush trackers have found clues such as a knife sheath and a set of small footprints, but tip-offs from bush searches, investigations of CCTV and interviews with neighbours and local businesses have not uncovered a solid lead.

But despite the lengthy search efforts Supt Fehon said police were aiming to broaden their investigation.

'We are following every possible avenue of inquiry that is being provided to us, be it CCTV, be it information regarding persons that may have been in the area, and we're asking the public if they know of anything to provide that information to Crime Stoppers,' he said.

Police searching for missing toddler William Tyrell have questioned motorists who may have been driving past the house where he disappeared more than a week ago, in an increasingly desperate hunt for clues

Police predict the three year old, who was last seen on Friday morning playing in the front yard of his Kendall home, is in a poor state of health and has had no food or water for three days since going missing

Around 200 volunteers from the local community helped out to try and find the toddler. The search also involved SES, RFS, local surf lifesaving club members
