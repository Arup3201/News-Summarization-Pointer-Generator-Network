The official start of the tourist season landed with a cold, wet thud across parts of Upstate New York and New England this weekend, thanks to a freak snowstorm and unseasonably cold temperatures.

But, at least one business in the region is celebrating the bizarre weather. Whiteface Lake Placid ski resort in Wilmington, New York, reported nearly three feet of snow on Sunday.

The ski resort posted remarkable pictures on its Twitter page showing employees in a heavy winter coats and four-wheel drive trucks frolicking in massive snow drifts.

The resort sits atop Whiteface Mountain, one of the highest peaks in the Adirondack Mountains. Even given the elevation of the mountain, the 34 inches of snow in late May was a remarkable sight.

Communities at higher elevations in Vermont, New Hampshire, Upstate New York and northwest Maine all reported snowfall on Sunday.

Most of the snow was little more than a dusting of large wet flakes. Above 2,800 feet of elevation, though, the snow was more substantial.

Confused residents took to Twitter to bemoan the wintry weather.

Snowflakes were confined to the higher summits of northern New England but the chilly weather lingered all day as cloud cover and rain kept highs in the 40s and 50s from New England to northeastern New York.

However, the long weekend will conclude with drier conditions and temperatures returning closer to average so those who like to kick-off the beach season on Memorial Day may still get the chance.

Residents of the Adirondack Mountains are no doubt used to snow piling up - just not in May

Residents of Binghamton, New York, 
reported sleet and soft hail on Friday afternoon, according to 
Weather.com, which is the latest date of either sleet or snow on record,
 there, dating to 1951.

In
 Syracuse, a brief period of flurries late on Friday night was the 
city's latest occurrence of snow on record, topping the previous 'latest
 snow' record from May 17, 1973.

According to Accuweather, there were even reports of trees down in some parts of Vermont due to heavy snow.

Sunday
 should be more pleasant in the Southeast, with mostly dry weather and 
temperatures in the 70s and 80s, however scattered thunderstorms could 
spread into the Tennessee Valley, southern Appalachians and Carolinas 
tomorrow.

Trees: There were even reports of trees down in some parts of Vermont due to heavy snow, though this Twitter picture is from New Hampshire

Snow: Some areas including Littleton, New Hampshire, pictured, recorded snow on Sunday

The area saw 
near-record low temperatures On Saturday and this morning, with most 
locations in the 40s and 50s and even a few 30s in the southern 
Appalachians.

In the central U.S., wild weather, 
which saw two women killed after they were swept away by floodwaters in 
San Antonio, Texas, will continue to be a threat across the holiday 
weekend.

Scattered
 showers and thunderstorms are possible from the Plains into the Middle 
and Upper Mississippi Valleys, with forecasters predicting particularly 
severe weather in the Plains.

The
 Great Lakes and Upper Mississippi Valley, including Minneapolis and 
Chicago should see high temperatures in the 60s to near 70. Temperatures of 80s and a few 90s are forecast in the central and southern Plains.

The
 northwest is likely to see showers and thunderstorms through the 
weekend and by Monday these will expand south into northern California 
including the Bay Area.

The mixed forecast comes after 
weekend rains deluged numerous roads in San Antonio, forcing more than 
235 rescues by emergency workers who aided stranded motorists and 
homeowners at times using inflatable boats.

In
 addition to the two deaths, a teenage boy was also reported missing 
after Saturday's torrential rains, carried away while trying to cross 
the swollen Cibolo Creek in the San Antonio suburb of Schertz, 
authorities said.

At
 the height of Saturday's torrential downpours, San Antonio Mayor Julian
 Castro urged residents not to drive as a flash flood warning covered 
nearly two dozen counties. Nearly 10 inches of rainfall was reported in a
 matter of hours Saturday at the city's airport.

The
 National Weather Service said the flash flood threat would persist 
until late Sunday morning though mostly cloudy weather with occasional 
thunderstorms and showers was expected to give way to partly sunny skies
 later in the day.

Widespread: The Olmos Basin Municipal Golf Course and Basse Road are underwater as a result of heavy rains in San Antonio on Saturday

The rains left more than 200 
residents of the Texas city stranded in cars and homes when water rose 
unexpectedly up to 4 feet in some spots. Traffic also was snarled, 
making driving difficult.

'It
 was pretty crazy,' said Gera Hinojosa, a valet parking cars downtown 
after the storm. 'It was pretty unexpected. We hardly got any warning 
about it.'

One
 woman became trapped in her car and climbed to the roof before being 
swept away in floodwaters, said San Antonio Fire Department spokesman 
Christian Bove. Her body was later found against a fence, he said.

Emergency
 officials also recovered the body of a woman in her 60s who was swept 
away in her car while firefighters were trying to rescue her. Authorities did not immediately identify the women.

Heating up: Temperatures were heating up over the course of Sunday though thunderstorms were predicted in the central U.S.

Memorial Day: Drier conditions are expected for tomorrow though some areas can still expect thunderstorms

At
 nightfall, water still was pooling in many ditches and underpasses. 
Several roadways were closed, including a major highway linking the 
suburbs and the city.

But
 even in low-lying neighborhoods along Commerce Street east of downtown 
San Antonio - a faded stretch of clapboard houses and beauty parlors - 
yards were clear. In the tourist district around the River Walk, the 
streets were thick with weekend holiday revelers.

While the water in some homes rose 4 
feet high, according to Bove, most residents experienced the floods 
primarily as a major traffic hassle.

Karen
 Herring, 50, who spent the day volunteering at a fitness contest at the
 AT&T Center, said participants complained of three-hour drives 
across town.

Crazy weather: Radar estimates of up to 9 inches of rain were recorded in an area between downtown San Antonio and Leon Valley over to Hollywood Park, according to the NWS

Flash flooding: Massive flooding was reported on Saturday across South Texas as emergency crews scrambled to rescue residents in flood prone areas

In the city, even a municipal bus was swept away, but firefighters on a boat were able to pluck the three passengers and driver to safety, public transit spokeswoman Priscilla Ingle said. Nobody was injured.

The San Antonio International Airport by Saturday afternoon had recorded 9.87 inches of rain since midnight, causing nearly all streams and rivers to experience extraordinary flooding. The highest amount of rainfall recorded since midnight was 15.5 inches at Olmos Creek at Dresden Drive.

The San Antonio River about 20 miles southeast of the city, near Elmendorf, was expected to peak at 62 feet by Sunday morning, well above the flood stage of 35 feet, the National Weather Service said.

The National Weather Service compared the flooding to the storm of October 1998, when 30 inches of rain fell in a two-day period. In that flood, the Guadalupe and San Antonio River basins overflowed, leaving more than 30 people dead, according to the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority.
