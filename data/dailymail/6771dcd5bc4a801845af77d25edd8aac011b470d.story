A man who is accused of killing his ex-fiance in September 2013 and was charged with drugging and raping her in March has been arrested.

Kevin Michael Adams, 50, of Frisco, Texas was arrested on Friday. He is charged with capital murder and is currently held at the Collin County sheriff's detention center, CBS DFW reports.

Adams allegedly killed his reported stockbroker ex-fiance Nicole Leger, 34, who was found dead in her Melissa, Texas home by her 17-year-old son after school on September 9, 2013, according to WFAA.

According to the arrest warrant, Leger died from two gunshot wounds to her face.

Leger was also allegedly attacked and sexually assaulted by Adams at his Frisco residence in March 2013 when she went to pick up some of her things, The Dallas Morning News reports. Leger and Adams had lived together in Frisco before breaking up in February 2013.

Adams allegedly drugged her food, tied her up in his garage and raped her, CBS DFW says. In March he was charged with aggravated sexual assault and unlawful restraint.

Leger was granted an emergency protective order in March when Adams posted bail, the channel adds. Her son reportedly told police Adams has threatened to kill his mother, as well.

In April 2013, Adams reportedly violated his protective order when he sent Leger a card and flowers, CBS DFW reports.

Adams' DNA, collected during the March 2013 sexual assault case, linked him to Leger's Melissa residence, which he was not supposed to know about, the channel adds.

Adams had told authorities that he was in Frisco at the time of Leger's murder and had previously been considered a person of interest in the case, according to WFAA.

The channel adds that Adams reportedly had a large collection of weapons and ammunition, including some stored in a storage unit owned by his ex-wife. In a search of the unit, an unfired bullet's markings matched a shell casing at the crime scene of his ex-fiance's death.

The warrant for Adams' arrest also says an office investigating the case believes Adams killed Leger to prevent her testimony in the sexual assault case, WFAA adds.
