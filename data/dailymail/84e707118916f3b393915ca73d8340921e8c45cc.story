'Inappropriate': Wild Card Kitty is among the dancers performing in the Crown Jewels: Best of British show tonight which the group of injured soldiers won't be attending

A charity organised night out for injured soldiers to a burlesque show has been cancelled after the Ministry of Defence deemed the event to be 'inappropriate'.

Armed Forces charity Stubs had bought 25 tickets for the Crown Jewels: Best of British caberet show for injured Afghanistan veterans recovering at the Headley Court rehabilition unit in Surrey.

But the trip to tonight's London show was cancelled by Commanding Officer, Group Captain Clare Walton because the show is too risqu√©.

According to The Times, the charity is appealing for other groups with links to the Armed Forces to come forward if they want the tickets. They have even been offered to the Chelsea Pensioners.

The Shepherd's Bush show is part of the nine day London Burlesque Festival which is now in its seventh year.

Stubs, which works to reintegrate military casualties with a variety of injuries into society, had booked tonight's earlier of two showings so that the troops weren't too tired and so that the wheelchairs could be accommodated more easily.

Tonight's show, at Bush Hall, features acts such as Bettsie Bonbon, Hettie Heartache and Wild Card Kitty.

But Betty D'Light, production manager of the show, told MailOnline that the MoD have got the wrong impression about what burlesque consists of.

She said: 'We've been working with the charity for a while on this, we always try and help charities who want to make group bookings.

'We went to quite a lot of bother to rearrange the seating for the group to accommodate wheelchairs and we had hoped that the performers would come out afterwards and have their picture taken with the soldiers.

'The unfortunate thing is that the 
charity loses out on the money - we can't offer them a refund because 
the show's sold out - it's left a bit of a difficult situation.

'The saddest thing is that when I spoke to the charity, she said that the soldiers were really disappointed.

Glamourous: Betty D'Light (not pictured), the shows production manager, says that burlesque is tasteful and that some people still have the wrong impression of it

'Burlesque
is just a harmless bit of fun and it's so huge now that it's quite rare
for people to have this kind of opinion on it.

'It's all very tasteful and all in the style of glamorous burlesque and we also have a variety of cabaret acts on stage too.

'Whoever
it was (that cancelled the trip) has probably got the wrong impression 
of what it's all about - some people associate it with seedy strip clubs
and it's completely the opposite to that.'

She
added: 'Burlesque has been around for a long time and in the 1930s, 40s
and 50s famous dancers of the time performed for the troops and that 
was sixty years ago and was fine then.

'Now people have this strange opinion of it - it would've been nice to continue that tradition.'

Festival organiser Chaz Royal told The Times: 'It's classic, glamourous and tasteful. It's not a seedy show by any means.

'You could take your granny to it.'

An MOD spokesperson said: 'Headley Court has a strong relationship with a number of charities who provide generous gifts for our injured Service Personnel.

'On this occasion we felt the offer was inappropriate however we are grateful to charities and the general public for their continued support for the Armed Forces.'
