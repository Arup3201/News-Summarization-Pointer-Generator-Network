Gunfire echoes across the desert plain as a Kurdish army commander, crouched on a dusty ridge, takes his finger off  his AK-47 trigger and lifts his binoculars. ‘They’re definitely getting closer,’ announces Shehab Ahmed Hamed a few moments later in a theatrical whisper.

By ‘they’ he meant the Islamic State militants fighting Kurdish armed forces, or Peshmerga, only a mile and a half away in the village of Shovepelke.

Thankfully we could only hear their guns, not see them, though that was scant comfort. ‘We need your British warplanes more than ever now,’ said Shehab after a long sigh.

Thin line of defence: Fighters beneath the Kurdish flag near Makhmour

We didn’t know it at the time – it was late yesterday morning – but as he spoke two RAF Tornadoes carrying laser-guided bombs were already flying over Northern Iraq, prepared to strike at IS targets.

Here in northern Iraq, on the frontline in the battle against IS, British assistance – any assistance from above, in fact – would indeed be most welcome. Behind us, at the foot of the Karajokh mountains, the fearful Kurdish town  of Makhmour shimmered in the distance. Its people feel trapped, surrounded – and very scared.

Makhmour fell to the Islamists a month ago, only to be reclaimed by  the Peshmerga a few days later. But there are increasing concerns that without the support of coalition jets, it may fall again soon.

‘Please tell David Cameron that IS are all around us,’ says 22-year-old Marwa Fazil, who returned home yesterday after fleeing in terror last month with her children, aged two and three.

Her husband stayed to fight with the Peshmerga. There was, she recalls, ‘a sick feeling of dread in my stomach’ when the ominous black flags of IS were raised across the town, when its terrorists swept from house to house, pillaging and killing and burning down shops.

Bullet holes scar the walls of buildings, broken glass still carpets the pavements. ‘It keeps returning, that feeling. I don’t know how long it will be safe here,’ says Marwa. ‘We all fear them coming back and I am terrified something will happen to  my children.’

All over the town, David Cameron’s name is invoked with an almost strange frequency by both young and old. They whooped with joy, they said, when the Commons voted in favour of air strikes.

‘We keep a close eye on what goes on in UK,’ explained Shehab later, a patterned scarf hung around his waist in traditional Kurdish fashion. ‘We have to. What is decided in your country can make the difference between life and death here.’

As if suddenly embarrassed by this melodramatic flourish, he quickly laughed. ‘Of course, we know the names of Manchester United’s new signings too.’

Makhmour, with a population of around 6,000, is 30 miles from the city of Erbil, the oil-rich capital of Iraqi Kurdistan, which IS has coveted for months. Buoyed by the capture of Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, the jihadists managed to reach Erbil’s margins in the summer, but were repelled.

‘They want to take Makhmour again because it is the last place before Erbil,’ said another Peshmerga fighter, Idres Salem Muamed. ‘It is strategically important to them.’

Directly opposite the cafe in the centre of the town, where Idres sat drinking tea with other Peshmerga soldiers yesterday morning, were the burnt remains of an electrical goods store.

‘They [Islamic State] did this when they were here; they burnt down a lot of our houses and shops,’ said Idres.

‘Near here they killed a child, a boy, who was fleeing with his mother and father. We knew they were coming. We could see the black flags flying from their cars.

We evacuated all the women and children – most went to the mountains – but there was not enough Peshmerga to fight back.

‘So we had to retreat and regroup and then we came back after a few days in greater numbers – 600 of us in  all from all over the region. The Islamists  soon took flight.’

It is only now that the women and children are beginning to drift back and many, like Marwa, already wish they hadn’t.

In their absence the men of the town, ranging in age from 17 to 70, took up arms. Few had any military experience. They are a volunteer army ready to fight alongside the Peshmerga.

Three miles away the front line is formed of mounds of earth. At the point where Shehab watched and waited yesterday, there was a cluster of tents, some plastic chairs and the Kurdish flag atop a pole that kept threatening to keel over. In all, it isn’t much of a bulwark against marauding terrorists.

‘But it’s the best we’ve got at the moment’, said Shehab.

Alternately peering through his binoculars and aiming his gun, Shehab said fighting was raging ‘beyond the clump of trees in the far distance’.

He added: ‘This morning the IS took control of Shovepelka and another settlement, Hoshtralok, which is nearby. But the Peshmerga has now moved in and there is fighting from close quarters. It has been going on since nine o’clock this morning.’

 'It is vital that Britain get involved because it gives legitimacy to our war. It means it is not just the US and a few others, but Europe to'

As well as help from above, the soldiers beseech the UK to ‘send us weapons’. In Makhmour, at least, they possess only archaic rifles and ‘not enough semi-automatics’.

In comparison, the IS terrorists’ arsenal is sophisticated, much of it the latest hardware from the United States. At the Peshmerga’s regional HQ, a few miles down the dusty desert road to Erbil, it is this subject that senior commander Najdt Ali Salin is constantly turning over in his mind.

‘Air strikes alone are not enough,’ he said. ‘We don’t need soldiers from Britain and America but we do need some of the marvellous weapons you have in the UK.

‘The air strikes have helped us a great deal, allowed us to recapture lost land, towns and villages. We need more, though, to strengthen our positions around Makhmour and push them [IS] further back.

‘It is vital that Britain gets involved because it gives legitimacy to our war. It means it is not just the US and a few others, but Europe too.

‘But more sophisticated weapons, are essential if we are to win this war. I do not wish to be ungrateful, I was delighted to hear the news about your Parliament’s vote.’

Elsewhere in the HQ, which was occupied briefly by IS, a less senior soldier boasted about recent successes. ‘We have killed 47 IS militants in villages around here in the past week, ‘ he said as he flourished his mobile phone, full of pictures of dead bodies.

Back at the front line, Shahab had tilted his binoculars upwards and was scanning the skies. There was still no news about Britain’s Tornados – which did not, in fact, strike at IS targets yesterday. ‘They may be further north around Mosul,’ he said. ‘Never mind. Perhaps next time for us.’
