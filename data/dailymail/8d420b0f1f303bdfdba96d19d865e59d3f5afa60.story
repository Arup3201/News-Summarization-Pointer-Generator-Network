Amazon has revealed its updated Kindle Paperwhite eReader, which includes new 'reading features' pictured

Amazon has revealed its updated Kindle Paperwhite eReader, which has a better display than its predecessor including a next-generation built-in light for reading in the dark.

The company claims the sixth generation Kindle device is its 'most-advanced eReader' as it comes with with a higher contrast display, a faster processor, the latest touch technology and new features for readers.

The Paperwhite is the only version of the Kindle with a white-coloured light-up screen and this latest model will start shipping on October 9.

The 'basic' version will retail for £109, while the Kindle Paperwhite 3G will cost £169 and will start shipping at a later date of November 6.

Amazon's Kindle has been the best-selling eReader for six years and according to the internet retailer, Kindle owners read four times as many books as they did prior to owning an eReader.

The new model has a higher contrast screen with better reflectivity, which means 'whites are whiter and blacks are blacker, so the pages are virtually indistinguishable from a physical book,' Amazon claims.

The new built-in light guides light to the surface of the eReader in a way designed not to strain readers' eyes, while the eReader promises to be 25 per cent faster than its predecessor so that users can turn pages more smoothly.

The tablet uses a touch screen, which is almost 20 per cent more sensitive than before, while avoiding accidental page turns and there is a new feature called 'page flip' to allow readers to scan a book by chapter or skip to the end without losing their place.

The new model has a higher contrast screen with better reflectivity, which means 'whites are whiter and blacks are blacker, so the pages are virtually indistinguishable from a physical book,' Amazon claims. The Kindle Paperwhite is also the only one of the family to have a light for night-time reading

A 'smart lookup' feature integrates a dictionary with Wikipedia to allow users to search for definitions and information without losing the place in their book and  a 'vocabulary builder' compiles a list of words users look up.

Just like its predecessors, the eReader has a no-glare display, eight weeks of battery life, built-in Wi-Fi as standard and can download a book in under 60 seconds.

Despite tablet computers falling in price, eReaders are still in demand and  have carved a niche in the market because of the no-glare technology they use for screens.

Writing on the Amazon site, 'Gonzalo' said: 'The reading experience is much better than that from using a tablet or a smartphone...if you like to read a lot you definitely need a Kindle, and the best one available is the Paperwhite.'

Another eReader owner called Klopus said:  'I use tablets for everything but reading books. For that I vastly prefer Kindles due to more natural experience, better portability and less eye strain.'

Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and CEO, said: 'No one is investing on behalf of readers or pushing the boundaries of hardware, software and content for readers like this team: the new Kindle Paperwhite has brand-new display technology, the next generation of our built-in light, a faster processor, plus all of the exclusive benefits of the Kindle ecosystem.'

The Paperwhite is the only version of the Kindle with a white-coloured light-up screen and this latest model will start shipping on October 9. The 'basic' version will retail for £109, while the Kindle Paperwhite 3G will cost £169 and will start shipping at a later date of November 6
