Cube shaped robots that can flip, jump and assemble themselves into different shapes have been unveiled by scientists.

The small robots, known as M-Blocks, have no external parts but can move using an internal flywheel mechanism and can stick together using magnets.

While the curious machines might seem like colourful versions of the 'liquid steel' androids in the terminator films, their creators think they could one day be used to make temporary repairs to bridges and buildings.

Cube-shaped robots that can flip, jump and assemble themselves into different shapes have been unveiled by scientists. The small robots, known as M-Blocks have no external parts but can move using an internal flywheel mechanism and can stick together using magnets

In the finale of Terminator 2, Sarah Connor attempts to kill the T-1000 with a shotgun, but he simply rebuilds himself on the spot. T-1000 is made of 'liquid metal' that is capable of rapid shapeshifting, near-perfect mimicry and rapid recovery from damage. MIT's robots are not quite the same, but can shape shift

Researchers at at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) said their modular robots can adapt to different tasks and terrains.

The M-Blocks are cubes with no external moving parts, but are able to climb over and around aone another,Â leap through the air, roll across the ground, and even move while suspended upside down from metallic surfaces.

Inside each M-Block is a flywheel that can reach speeds of 20,000 revolutions per minute and when the flywheel is braked, it imparts its angular momentum to the cube, which lets it move independently as well as in part of a group.

On each edge of an M-Block and on every face, are cleverly arranged permanent magnets that allow any two cubes to attach to each other. On each face of a cube are four more pairs of smaller magnets, arranged symmetrically, which help snap a moving cube into place when it lands on top of another

On each edge of an M-Block and on every face, are cleverly arranged permanent magnets that allow any two cubes to attach to each other.

Each edge has two cylindrical magnets that are mounted like rolling pins so that when two cubes approach each other, the magnets naturally rotate so that north poles align with south (and vice versa) allowing any cube to attach to any other.

On each face of a cube are four more pairs of smaller magnets that are arranged symmetrically, which help snap a moving cube into place when it lands on top of another.

The scientists said that they hope the modules can be miniaturised to one day allow hoards of swarming microrobots to self-assemble like the liquid steel androids in Terminator II.

They believe that 'armies' of mobile cubes could temporarily repair bridges or buildings during emergencies, or raise and reconfigure scaffolding for building projects.

In the Terminator 2 storyline, the T-1000 is made of 'liquid metal'.

Arnold Schwarzenegger's character explains that the T-1000 is a more advanced Terminator, composed entirely of a mimetic metal alloy, rendering it capable of rapid shapeshifting, near-perfect mimicry and rapid recovery from damage.

It can use its ability to quickly liquify and assume forms in innovative and surprising ways, including fitting through narrow openings, morphing its arms into solid metal tools or bladed weapons, walking through prison bars, and flattening itself on the ground to hide or ambush targets.

The T-1000 also had the ability to extrude small, simple items from itself.

The T-1000 can also change its color and texture to simulate flesh, clothing, and other nonmetallic materials.

The cubes could one day assemble into different types of furniture or heavy equipment as needed as well as swarming into environments hostile or inaccessible to humans, diagnosing problems and reorganising themselves to provide solutions, according to the team.

John Romanishin, one of the research scientists, said: 'We want hundreds of cubes, scattered 
randomly across the floor, to be able to identify each other, coalesce, 
and autonomously transform into a chair, or a ladder, or a desk, on 
demand.'

The team is is currently building an army of 100 cubes, each of which can move in any direction and designing algorithms to guide them.

They also imagine that some of the 
cubes could be adapted to perform specific tasks and carry equipment 
such as cameras, lights or battery packs.

Postdoctoral
student Kyle Gilpin said: 'In the vast majority of other modular 
systems, an individual module cannot move on its own. If you drop one of
these along the way, or something goes wrong, it can rejoin the group, 
no problem.'

Hod Lipson, a 
robotics researcher at Cornell University, who was initially skeptical 
that the robots really worked, said that the robots demonstrate a 'kind 
of cooperative group behaviour,' as multiple cubes work together and 
move other cubes.
