A British charity worker has been trapped in Africa since November after claiming to have fallen victim to a conman.

Des Cordery, 65, had travelled to Gambia where he had been visiting the grave of his late partner, who had died there in 2010 following a battle with cancer.

Mr Cordery had also been checking on the progress of a charity venture he set up with a local businessman and hotelier during a previous visit in August.

However, when he returned to the country three months later, he claimed that nothing had been done on the project.

Mr Cordery says he immediately pulled out of the project, but the hotelier called police and the British pensioner became caught up in a legal wrangle which ended with police confiscating his passport.

The incident comes more than four years after his partner of eight years, Veronique McPake, went to the West African nation in 2010 to die following a lengthy battle with thyroid cancer.

He said: ‘Veronique had been struggling with thyroid cancer for a while, and had always loved Gambia.

‘She didn't want to be a burden on her family, so when the time was near she went to the place closest to her heart. She was only 52.’

When Mr Cordery returned over the summer he said he witnessed the lack of resources for those with learning disabilities, and decided to set up a charity to help.

The grandfather-of-three, who lives in Kent and who has volunteered and worked for mental health charity Mencap, was befriended by a hotel owner and businessman.

According to Mr Cordery, the pair planned to build a day centre to help locals with learning disabilities in honour of his dead partner, and that he donated a sum of money to get the project off the ground.

He named it the McPake Educational Foundation.

But when he returned to the country in November to visit Veronique's grave and check progress on the foundation, he claimed that nothing had been done on the project.

Instead he claims that his business partner has spent his money renovating his hotel.

He was arrested thrown in a  cell after his partner allegedly called police when he pulled out of the deal.

He was unable to pay bail set by the local court, so his passport has been confiscated and he cannot get it back until he wins the case or stumps up 257,000 Gambian Dalasi (£4,000).

The retired schoolteacher added: ‘My charity partner basically turned round and tried suing me for loss of earnings because of the time he spent working on the project while I was in England.’ 

Mr Cordery, who has three grown-up children from a previous relationship, said: ‘I came out here to give some money to help set up a centre of people with learning difficulties and make the centre accessible for people in wheelchairs.

‘I think I have had a good life and it's time to give something back. I donated £800 to a police run local disabled school.

‘The directors of that school put me in contact with a local businessman who they said had been trying to open up a handicap school.

‘But it seems they have just spent the money on painting and decorating to make the hotel look good for resale. I believed him - I thought he was genuine all the way.

‘I don't want to pay this guy the money, partly because I can't afford to, and also because I want the money I can afford to spend to go to helping the needy, not lining the pockets of the greedy.’

So far seven hearings have been postponed at Kanifing Magistrates' Court in Serekunda.

Mr Cordery's brother Andrew, 67, of Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, said: ‘It's a bit of a pain for him.

'It's not clear what's going on and it's very unfortunate that he's got into this mess for his good intentions.’

The 65-year-old volunteered at East Kent Mencap, in Margate, for three years until he was employed as a case worker two years ago.

Alison Fengas, HR manager of East Kent Mencap, said: ‘His work with us involves dealing with people with learning difficulties in this country and he hoped to use his experience to help others in Gambia.

‘We all wish him well and we hope it's resolved as soon as possible.’

A spokesman for the British Embassy in Gambia said: ‘We can confirm the arrest of a British national in Gambia. We are providing consular assistance.’

But the embassy was unable to divulge further information on an ongoing civil matter, the spokesman said.

Mr Cordery will next appear before magistrates on Tuesday, but expects it may be months before he is free to return to Britain.
