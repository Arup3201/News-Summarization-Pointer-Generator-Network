A 23-year-old woman who binged on party drugs including ketamine and 'meow meow' during her teenage years - at one point snorting as many as 100 lines a day - has spoken out about how the substances left her body in tatters, and revealed she will now be having her bladder removed as a result of the damage inflicted upon it.

Danielle Watson, now clean, says she 'loved' taking horse tranquiliser ketamine and mephedrone, commonly known as 'meow meow', at parties, and quickly fell into a pattern of taking 5g - 50 lines - of each drug every day. Both substances cost £10 per gram.

Speaking to Closer magazine in the wake of a report revealing deaths by party drugs have quadrupled over the last five years, the young administrator from Nottingham - whose mother is a horse trainer and father a bus driver - said she 'fell in with the wrong crowd' after leaving home to live in a hostel aged 16.

Danielle Watson was taking 100 lines of ketamine and miow miow during her lowest point, and as a result she is now having her ruined bladder removed entirely

Danielle says she was a rebellious teenager but didn't realise the drugs were as 
dangerous as Class A substances such as cocaine and heroin - which she says she would never take - because 
mephedrone was still legal, and ketamine had been banned only the 
previous year.

When a friend offered her the party drugs she was told they were harmless. But soon her habit spiraled out of control, and eventually Danielle began finding blood in her urine.

Despite taking the drugs during the day, 
Danielle still managed to complete her Health and Social Care college 
course and work full-time at a call centre.

But
after collapsing at a party she was admitted to hospital where doctors 
revealed her bladder was so badly damaged - infected and covered with 
ulcers and scars - that she was going to have to have a catheter fitted.

She was forced to carry it around in her handbag, being able to drink only half a can of Coke before having to empty her bladder.

Deaths by party drugs such as ketamine and mephedrone have quadrupled in the last five years

She
said: 'Other girls have to pack their lipstick- but I have to carry a 
catheter in my handbag. I'm a totally different person now - my 
confidence has gone.

'I feel so unattractive. I haven't been intimate with anyone, let alone admitted the truth to a man.'

Recently,
tests revealed that the damage has worsened.

And later this month 
Danielle will be having her bladder completely removed and a new one 
fashioned out of part of her bowel.

She will 'urinate' through a hole 
next to her belly button.

She is horrified at the damage she has done to herself, and cannot believe that the drugs she was taking recreationally were ever legal to begin with.

She said: 'I'm so ashamed, but I want people to know about my condition because they need to realise how dangerous these drugs are.

'I didn't take the risks seriously because meow meow was legal back then and ketamine had only recently been made illegal. I loved the highs.

'I don't know if I will find a boyfriend or have a family - I can't bring myself to get intimate with a man. I feel ashamed and dirty.'

Elliot Elam, spokesperson for drugs charity Addaction, said: 'Young people don't realise how dangerous party drugs can be - the health risks must not be underestimated.'

It’s a powerful general anaesthetic that’s used for operations on humans and animals. The effects don’t last long, but until they wear off, ketamine can cause a loss of feelings in the body and paralysis of the muscles. It can also lead to users experiencing a distortion of reality.Ketamine, a Class C drug, can:

Mephedrone (often called ‘meow meow’) is a powerful stimulant and is part of the cathinone family, a group of drugs that are closely related to the  amphetamines - including amphetamine itself (often called ‘speed’), methamphetamine and ecstasy.

There is very little evidence about mephedrone and what long-term effects it has, but there have reports of people hospitalised due to the short-term effects. Also, you can never be entirely sure that what you’re buying is actually mephedrone and not something else.The main effects and risks of mephedrone, a Class B drug, include:
