Dunkin' Donuts will release gluten-free pastries this year

Dunkin' Donuts is the latest chain to jump on the gluten-free bandwagon, with plans to unveil a new wheat-free range across U.S. stores this year.

But while the gluten-free cinnamon sugar doughnut and blueberry muffin might help reduce bloating in sufferers of celiac disease, it won't do much for their overall weight.

According to Boston.com, the retailer's cinnamon doughnut clocks in at 320 calories, compared with the 260 calories in a regular glazed doughnut.

Although the gluten-free blueberry muffin is 400 calories - 60 calories less than the standard version.

Dunkin' Donurts executive chief Stan Frankenthaler said the new range aims to target a broader range of consumers. 

'We recognize the importance of providing our guests with many options, including alternative choices for people with food and dietary restrictions,' he said in an e-mail statement.

The pastries will be packaged separately to avoid contamination from other foods that contain wheat flour.

Less than 10 per cent of Americans have an intolerance to gluten, the major protein found in grains like wheat, barley and rye.

About one per cent of Americans have celiac disease, where even small amounts of gluten can prompt severe discomfort. Another eight per cent have a mild reaction to gluten.

However thousands of consumers have adopted gluten-free diets in recent years for the so-called 'health benefits', leaving the fast-food industry scrambling to keep up.

Coffee retailer Dunkin' Donuts is known for its carbohydrate-dense foods including bagels, doughnuts and muffins made with wheat flour

Domino’s Pizza Inc.has gluten-free crusts and Chipotle has gluten-free options, while Starbucks is considering creating some gluten-free 
items after it bought a bakery that sells organic breads last year, according to Bloomberg.

Nancy Childs, a food marketing professor at Saint Joseph’s University in Philadelphia, said more people are opting for wheat-free because they think it's better for them.

'The number of people who think they benefit from going gluten-free is growing,' she told Bloomberg.

'People feel that they are choosing a healthier alternative when they buy gluten-free fare.'

Even so, a gluten-free label may 
lure customers and help boost sales, according to data from researcher 
Nielsen.

U.S. sales of items labeled gluten-free were $19.7 billion in 
the year ended May 11, topping revenue for items identified as 
cholesterol-free, multi-grain or high-fiber, the data show.
