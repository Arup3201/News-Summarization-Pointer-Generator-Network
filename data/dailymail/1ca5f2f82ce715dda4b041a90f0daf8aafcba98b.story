Theresa May will visit 
Jordan in a bid to secure radical cleric Abu Qatada's extradition to the country, it was announced today.

Qatada has been released from jail under
strict bail conditions while the Government seeks assurances that 
evidence gained through torture would not be used in any trial against 
him.

But times is ticking because the 51-year-old cleric, once described by a judge as Osama bin Laden’s right-hand man in Europe, could be freed from his bail terms in just three months if Mrs May fails to show significant progress is being made in the talks.

Shock: Abu Qatada's (pictured earlier this week) landlord has told of his shock after discovering the radical cleric is living in his house with his family and has been in touch with the lettings agent to have him removed

The Home Secretary said today: 'The UK and Jordan remain committed to
ensuring that Abu Qatada must face justice and are pursuing all options
with regard to his deportation and it is my intention to travel back to
continue those negotiations shortly.'

Meanwhile the landlord of the house 
where hate preacher Abu Qatada is living following his release from 
prison has revealed he had no idea he was even there.

The landlord said he wants the radical cleric out 
and has already been in contact with letting agents who rented the 
property out on his behalf.

He said he had let the 
house in Wembley, north-west London out to a woman and her four children
who had a different name to Qatada.

But the 51-year-old cleric moved in with his wife and children to the £400,000 property after being freed from maximum security Long Lartin on Monday night.

His release as the result of a European human rights ruling caused outrage after it emerged 60 police will keep tabs on him, costing taxpayers £10,000 a week

But the 51-year-old cleric, once described by a judge as Osama bin Laden’s right-hand man in Europe, could be freed from his bail terms in just three months if Mrs May fails to show significant progress is being made in the talks.

Speaking after he heard the news the landlord, who cannot be identified, said he rented the property out on January 9 to a woman and four children whose name is different to Qatada. She signed a year's contract with a six month break clause.

He said: 'If he is living there I want him out. I’ve been on the phone to the agents all day. They didn’t even tell me.

'I don’t want someone like that living there. It’s not good for me. I would never rent my property to someone like Qatada.

'This is not something I stand for, it is humiliating. I cannot believe it. I want Abu Qatada and his family out of my house.'

Qatada was released from high security Long Lartin prison on Monday night and placed on a strict 22-hour curfew. He must stay at his home in Wembley, north London and cannot use a mobile phone or the internet

The landlord added: 'I am shocked. I knew nothing about this.'

He said he was called by a lettings agency in January saying the woman wanted to rent the property on a year's contract. The tenancy agreement was drawn up and he was told the woman did not have a husband.

He said the woman claims benefits and is paying him £1,900 a month.

It comes as yesterday a senior European human rights official has admitted Britain would face no real punishment if Qatada was put on a plane tomorrow.

Thomas Hammarberg said ‘there isn’t really a sanction’ were the government to ignore the European Court of Human Rights and deport the radical preacher.

The comments will heap pressure on Home Office ministers to ignore the court’s ruling and send Qatada back to Jordan.

The radical cleric, described by a British court as a ‘truly dangerous individual’ was released on bail this week as a result of the Strasbourg ruling.

Tory backbenchers have challenged Home Secretary Theresa May to follow the example of countries such as Italy and France who have ignored court rulings to deport dangerous foreign nationals.

Yesterday, in a further blow to hopes of deporting Qatada, a senior member of the Jordanian royal family appeared to pour scorn on the idea it would give in to Strasbourg’s demands.

Speaking to the BBC, Prince El Hassan of Jordan, uncle of King Abdullah, said: ‘If this man has committed crimes which is presumably why he is being held in England, I don’t know what kind of court one has to offer to the Europeans. Does it want a juvenile court?’

No sanctions: Thomas Hammarberg, a senior official, said kicking Abu Qatada out would 'set a negative example'

He added: ‘This is essentially a British European conversation and I don’t think democracy means that we have to appeal to every single European parliamentarian.’

Mr Hammarberg is commissioner for human rights at the Council of Europe, the court’s governing body. In an interview with the Guardian newspaper he accused ministers of not even reading the court’s judgement in the case.

Asked what the repercussions would be if Britain ignored the court’s ruling, he said: ‘Someone may file a complaint and there would be a judgment that there’s a violation of human rights, but it’s more the bad example.

‘It would send a signal that the UK, which currently holds the chair in the Council of Europe, is ignoring [judgments] and that would be such a bad signal. There would be a chain effect.’

‘It would set a negative example that would be used by other countries in Europe which are less keen on human rights. It would be extremely unfortunate to ignore the ruling. It’s a serious ruling and a serious matter.’

He added: ‘I have read the discussions in the UK and know that [Abu Qatada] is seen as a dangerous person. So I understand the heat but I’m not impressed by the arguments.’

‘The key point in the [ECHR] judgment in Strasbourg is torture, but it seems that the arguments have become about whether Britain should co-operate with European institutions.

‘It seems the ministers had not even read the judgments. They mixed up the EU and the Council of Europe. It was about torture, not whether to co-operate with European institutions.

Mr Hammarberg’s intervention is likely to inflame tensions between London and the council, at a time when ministers are trying to agree reforms to how the court works.

Qatada was released from high security Long Lartin prison on Monday night and placed on a strict 22-hour curfew. He must stay at his home in Wembley, north London and cannot use a mobile phone or the internet.

The ECHR judges said Qatada could not be sent back because he would not get a fair trial in Jordan - because evidence could be used against him which resulted from torture.

Home Office minister James Brokenshire travelled to Jordan earlier this week to attempt to broker a deal which would satisfy the ECHR.

Mrs May said: 'The Home Office 
Minister for Crime and Security, James Brokenshire MP, has led useful 
discussions with the Jordanian authorities and talks with officials will
continue.'

Mr Hammarberg said the court would need ‘watertight guarantees’ that evidence obtained from torture would not be used against Qatada at trial.

His comments sparked fury in Westminster last night.

Tory MP for Esher and Walton Dominic Raab said: ‘If Mr Hammarberg thinks Britain should go back cap in hand to the Strasbourg Court after this ludicrous judgment, he’s got another thing coming. In fact, since he is neither a judge nor an elected politician, he is pretty irrelevant to this debate.’
