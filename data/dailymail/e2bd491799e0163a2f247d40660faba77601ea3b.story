A year after a controversial 
biography of Mahatma Gandhi claimed he was bisexual and left his wife to
 live with a German-Jewish bodybuilder, the Indian government has bought a collection of letters between the two men days before they were to be auctioned.

India paid around £700,000 (60million rupees) for the papers, which cover Gandhi's time in South Africa, his return to India and his contentious relationship with his family.

The auction was to be held at Sotheby's in London on Tuesday but was called off at the last minute.

Lovers? Mahatma Gandhi and Hermann Kallenbach sit either side of a female companion. The Indian government has bought a collection of letters between the two men days before they were to be auctioned

The documents will now be placed with the National Archives of India in New Delhi.

They previously belonged to relatives
 of Hermann Kallenbach, a German-born Jewish architect who met Gandhi in
 South Africa in 1904 and was impressed by his ideas.

Last year, a Gandhi biography by author Joseph Lelyveld called Great Soul: Mahatma 
Gandhi And His Struggle With India detailed the extent of his 
relationship with Kallenbach.

It claimed that the leader of the Indian independence movement was deeply in love with Kallenbach.

Mr Lelyveld denied that his 
book said Gandhi was bisexual. But Gandhi's home state of Gujarat banned
 it as an 'insult' to the father of the nation.

Most of the correspondence, which 
spans five decades from 1905 to 1945, is from family, friends and 
followers of Gandhi, but there are also 13 letters written by him to 
Kallenbach.

They reference Gandhi's early political campaigns and the illness of his wife Kasturba.

He wrote in one letter: 'I no longer 
want to be angry with her so she is sweet... She had a few grapes today 
but she is suffering again. It seems to be me she is gradually sinking.'

In another, written before his return
 to India from South Africa, Gandhi wrote: 'I do all my writing 
squatting on the ground and eat invariably with my fingers. I don't want
 to look awkward in India.'

Indian historian Ramchandra Guha discovered the letters at the home of Kallenbach's grand-niece, Isa Sarid.

Almost auctioned: The documents previously belonged to relatives of Kallenbach, a German-born Jewish architect who met Gandhi in South Africa in 1904 and was impressed by his ideas

Gandhi and Kallenbach became constant companions after they met in Johannesburg in 1904.

Among the most illuminating of the 
documents are dozens of letters written by Gandhi's sons which provide 
details of his life in India, particularly in the period immediately 
after his return, when he lived in relative obscurity.

'Father is becoming more and more awful,' read one incomplete letter probably written by Harilal, his eldest son.

'It would not be strange if a time 
may come one of these days when either those who are living with Father 
might have to go or he might leave us all not being able to stand our 
life.'

India has in the past complained 
bitterly about private auctions of Gandhi's belongings, saying they 
insulted the memory of a man who rejected material wealth.

A senior official at the ministry of 
culture in New Delhi said: 'These papers are of huge importance to India
 to carry out research on the Gandhian view on various things, that is 
why we decided to purchase them.'

Sotheby's had put a pre-sale estimate of between £500,000 and £700,000 on the collection.

But the sale was pulled after Indian authorities agreed to purchase the entire archive for around £700,000 (60million rupees).

Sotheby's said in a statement: 'The 
Gandhi-Kallenbach archive... has been sold in a private transaction to 
the Indian government.'

Mr Lelyvel's book caused much controversy when it was published last year.

According to the book, Gandhi allegedly told Kallenbach: ‘How completely you have taken possession of my body. This is slavery with a vengeance.’

Kallenbach was born in Germany but emigrated to South Africa where he became a wealthy architect. 

Gandhi was working there and Kallenbach became one of his closest disciples.

The pair lived together for two years
 in a house Kallenbach built in South Africa and pledged to give one 
another ‘more love, and yet more love... such love as they hope the 
world has not yet seen'.

At the age of 13 Gandhi had been 
married to 14-year-old Kasturbai Makhanji, but after four children 
together they split in 1908 so he could be with Kallenbach, the book 
says.

At one point he wrote to the German: 
‘Your portrait (the only one) stands on my mantelpiece in my bedroom. 
The mantelpiece is opposite to the bed.’

Although it is not clear why, Gandhi wrote that vaseline and cotton wool were a ‘constant reminder’ of Kallenbach.

He nicknamed himself ‘Upper House’ 
and his lover ‘Lower House’ and he vowed to make Kallenbach promise not 
to ‘look lustfully upon any woman’.

'I cannot imagine a thing as ugly as the intercourse of men and women,’ he later told him.

They were separated in 1914 when 
Gandhi went back to India – Kallenbach was not allowed into India 
because of the First World War, after which they stayed in touch by 
letter.

As late as 1933 he wrote a letter telling of his unending desire and branding his ex-wife ‘the most venomous woman I have met’.
