Greg Ham, the flautist from Australian band Men at Work, has been found dead by police at his Melbourne home.

Mr Ham, 58, played the chirpy flute riff in the song Down Under which became an international hit.

The song which was released in early 1982 and went on to top the charts in both the UK and US.

It famously mentions Vegemite sandwiches and which became linked with the 1983 Australian win in the America's Cup yacht race from the US.

Mr Ham's death was confirmed by police who discovered his body at his home in the Melbourne suburb Carlton.

A police spokesman said: 'We have established a crime scene 
and the local crime investigation unit are attempting to determine cause
of death.

Success: Greg Ham in 1983

'There are a number of unexplained 
aspects to it and we're 
assisting the local detectives to determine what has occurred.'

Despite  Men At Work's success Mr Ham lived with disappointment at the way his Down Under tune would be remembered.

In 2010 a court decided that the flute riff was unmistakably the same as another Australia song called Kookaburra.

The music was written by a Melbourne schoolteacher more than 75 years ago for a Girl Guides competition.

Following the judgement Mr Hay said: 'I'll go to my grave knowing Down Under is an original piece of work.

'In over 20 years no one noticed the reference to Kookaburra.'

The flute riff is still played by radio 
stations and in households around the world.

It was also played in the closing ceremony of the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.

Among the quirky words that helped push the song to the top of the charts are: 'Do you come from a land Down Under? Where women glow and men plunder?'Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder? 'You better run, you better take cover.'
