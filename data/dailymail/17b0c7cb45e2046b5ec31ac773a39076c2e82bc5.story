Starbucks yesterday pledged to ‘actively recruit’ British staff over the next five years to fill 5,000 new jobs.

The coffee shop chain is to open 300 outlets and said the majority of new posts would go to UK-born workers.

Chris Grayling, the Employment Minister, has attacked some fast-food chains for using too many overseas staff.

But Starbucks’ UK boss Kris Engskov said: ‘Each shop will represent the make-up of our neighbourhoods.

‘The majority of jobs will go to British people – there are plenty who are qualified.’

It comes as brewer Greene King 
announced it expects to create 3,000 new jobs in the next three years 
with 2,000 apprenticeships for 18-24-year-olds.

Starbucks said around half of the 
drive-throughs will be operated under licence by petrol forecourt 
retailer Euro Garages, which mainly operates in the north of England, 
while the remaining stores will be company owned.

The chain has nearly 9,000 company-owned stores and just over 8,000 licensed outlets in more than 50 countries.

The announcement, which comes two 
weeks after official figures revealed youth unemployment had exceeded 
one million, was welcomed by Prime Minister David Cameron, who said it 
was a 'great boost to the British economy'.

And Nick Clegg, Deputy Prime Minister, 
backed the company's UK expansion with a visit to a London store to 
celebrate the jobs news.

Kris Engskov, managing director of 
Starbucks UK & Ireland, said the expansion plans would particularly 
benefit young jobseekers as half the chain's baristas are under 
24-years-old.

He told the Daily Telegraph there was 
definitely a need for drive-through branches as many commuters drove to 
work without passing a shop and parents enjoyed buying a coffee without 
having to park their car and get their children out of their seats.

The firm has been piloting 10 road-side shops in the UK in the past three years.

Starbucks has expanded into different marketplaces in the UK including trains, planes, supermarkets and workplaces.

In 2010, it opened 35 motorway stores with Welcome Break.

Growth business: Greene King brews the IPA ale brand and is planning to expand creating 3,000 jobs

Meanwhile Greene King, the owner of 
Hungry Horse and Loch Fyne Restaurants, has said that they will create 
3,000 new jobs as it gears up for more growth.

The Suffolk-based company wants to 
create the roles over three years to boost its tally of 950 managed pubs
and restaurants to 1,100.

A spokesman said the expansion has 
been driven by strong food sales as consumers trade down from more 
expensive restaurant-only competitors.

The chain owner said new sites and 
strong demand helped total food sales jump 16.3 per cent in the first six months
of its financial year.

The company said there were more 
opportunities for growth and added that current trading remained strong,
with a 12 per cent increase in Christmas bookings despite the current economic 
climate.

Rival brewer and pub chain Marston's 
has also pledged to build another 25 pubs in a move set to create 1,000 
jobs over the next year.

The company said it had built 19 new pubs this year and planned to build 25 a year from 2012.

Marston's who has more than 2,000 pubs
across the UK and brews Pedigree and Banks's ales, said food sales were
up five per cent on a year ago and made up 42 per cent of total sales.

A spokesman said the company's pubs had sold more than 26million meals over the year, charging an average of £6.10.

Chief executive, Ralph Findlay, added:
'We achieved impressive sales and profits growth despite a challenging 
consumer environment. Customers are looking for affordable treats.'
