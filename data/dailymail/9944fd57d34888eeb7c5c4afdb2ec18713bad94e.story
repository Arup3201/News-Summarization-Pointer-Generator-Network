Opposition Leader Bill Shorten has branded the prime minister's remarks in front of the world’s leaders on Saturday ‘weird and graceless’.

After Tony Abbott attempted to take control of the G20 heavyweights at a meeting at Queensland’s Parliament House in Brisbane – telling them they should call each other by their first names – the Labor leader hit out.

Mr Abbott cited his own difficulties with the Australian budget - particularly in gaining support for proposed higher education changes and the $7 GP co-payment - as examples of the need to persist with important reforms

Mr Shorten said the lunchtime discussion was a missed opportunity to promote Australia's position as a global leader.

‘This was Tony Abbott's moment in front of the most important and influential leaders in the world and he's whinging that Australians don't want his GP tax,’ Mr Shorten said in a statement to AAP. 

Mr Abbott gave leaders from around the world a set of conversational protocols to adhere and asked them to 'speak from their hearts' as they arrived in Brisbane to figure out how to boost global economic growth.

Ahead of an Aussie BBQ lunch made up of Queensland's finest produce at the 'leaders retreat', Mr Abbott and the G20 powerhouses sat in a circle to discuss economic issues.

Mr Abbott instructed the likes of President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin to 'only speak for five minutes' at a time.

He said he wanted a 'very candid and very honest discussion on where our countries can and should go.' 

The G20 heavyweights are this weekend attempting to create a plan to achieve a 2.1% boost in global economic growth by 2018.

'I would like the discussion to focus on the politics of economic reform... in the end though this is your retreat it is open for you to raise any subject that you wish,' he said.

'If we can speak from our hearts not from a script please,' he asked.  

'We have a heavy responsibilities all of us, the world is looking to all of us right now to try to demonstrate.

'We know what we are doing and have a plan for growth and for jobs and that's our challenge - to leave this G20 meeting in 48 hours time having installed confidence in the people of the world that there is a better and brighter future for all of us,' he said.

'We all know what we would like to do,' Mr Abbott said.

He knows better than many presidents and prime ministers about the perils of trying to get economic reform through parliament.

His 14-month-old government has been frustrated by the Senate blocking billions of dollars in budget measures.

He said deregulating universities and the $7 GP co-payment were examples of important reforms which in some G20 countries would not be unusual, but in Australia had been 'massively difficult'.

As US President Barack Obama arrived in his own vehicle - The Beast - for the BBQ at Parliament House and climbed out of his the armoured car he asked waiting reporters: 'Hey! How are you?'

Russian President Vladimir Putin also seemed to be in good spirits, flashing a small smile for the cameras. 

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, dressed in a suit and blue tie, pulled up just after 9am. 

He had earlier on Saturday held bilateral meetings with Italy's Matteo Renzi, Brazil's Dilmah Rousseff, and Spain's Mariano Rajoy.

Over the course of the G20 weekend there will be 100 chefs and 600 wait staff working 14 hours a day to provide 100,000 meals to the 7,000 delegates and official media.

G20 organisers are unwilling to divulge the exact menu that the political heavyweights will dine on over the weekend because of security reasons.

However, earlier this week executive chef at the Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre Martin Latter told the ABC that Mr Abbott's favourite meat could be served up.

Porterhouse steak is reportedly going to be cooked on the BBQ and Penfolds wine - one of Australia's oldest labels, founded in 1844 in Adelaide -  has also been requested.

Mr Latter explained that 80 per cent of the produce will come from Queensland and planning for the meals began over a year ago. 

'Every lunch and dinner will showcase different Australian meals. Everything will be the very best you can get in the country,' Mr Latter said. 

The BBQ was an opportunity for the leaders to mingle without the presence of their many aids.

Elsewhere, Treasurer Joe Hockey, who chaired the final meeting of finance ministers on Saturday, said he was confident the G20 could achieve its target of two per cent growth by 2018. 

'My finance minister colleagues and I are resolute in our determination to use all policy levers to generate growth and jobs,' he said.

Among the country plans were 1000 individual measures to lift infrastructure investment, increase trade and competition, cut red tape and lift labour market participation.

It is understood the final communique will show plans for a 2.1 per cent rise in growth, slightly better than expected in earlier talks.

Earlier, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told reporters that while the growth target was welcome, the employment created needed to be 'decent' jobs.

'We must pursue an agenda that advances sustainability, addresses inequalities and generates decent jobs, especially for young people,' he said.

Mr Ban said he understood climate change would also be on the G20's two-day meeting agenda, despite reports to the contrary.

He urged other countries to follow the lead of the US, China and Europe by bolstering their carbon emission reduction targets and contributing to a global fund.

Meanwhile, in Brisbane, some pedestrians have reported having to wait more than 40 minutes to cross city roads. Non-G20 traffic was also going nowhere fast as the motorcades traversed the city.
