Defying odds of one-in-a-trillion, a Derby couple were shocked to find a box of six eggs which were all double-yolkers.

The chances of finding just a single double-yolk egg are less than one in 1,000.

But a box of six double-yolkers as John and Angela Winfield, of Breadsall, Derby, found is even more unlikely than winning the lottery.

Two of the double-yolked eggs: a Derby couple were shocked to find all six eggs were double-yolkers

John, 48, was rustling up sausage, egg and chips for his wife’s tea and popped to corner shop Chyahm Food and Wine, near his home to pick up a box of eggs.

When he cracked the first egg into the frying pan and saw the double yolk he couldn’t believe his luck.

John said: 'My wife and I often have eggs but I’d never seen a double yolk before in all my life.

'Then I cracked another open and I 
couldn’t believe it - there was another one. The odds of what was 
happening kept going through my head.

'I
 was really excited because I wondered whether there could be even more 
double-yolkers in the box. But I didn’t dare to find out until I made 
dinner again the next day.'

The British Egg Information Service said the chances of one double-yolked egg are less than 0.1per cent - one in 1,000.

The first double-yolked egg was a surprise, but John couldn't believe it when he cracked the next egg and it also turned out to be double-yolked

That could make the odds of finding 
six in one box one in a trillion, although experts say that 
double-yolked eggs come in clusters from young hens about 20-to-28 weeks old.

When the first egg is double-yolked, the box is likely to contain more double-yolked eggs, they claim.

John added: 'When it got down to the last one, I was so nervous that I actually dropped it. It cracked on to the kitchen floor and there was yet again another double yolk.

'What happened must be as unlikely as winning the lottery - although the lottery would be better, obviously. We’d probably be sitting in another country right now and not eating eggs.'

John, who is a full-time carer for his wife, said: 'I love a yolk, so to have two for each egg meant they tasted great.

Winning the lottery: 14,000,000 to one.

Becoming an astronaut: 13,200,000 to one.

Being killed by lightning: 2,320,000 to one.

Being killed by a shark: 264,100,000 to one.

'Fried eggs are my favourite and I really like them runny, so it worked out well.'

Angela, who suffers from osteoarthritis, was just as amazed.

The 43-year-old said: 'I didn’t think these things happened anymore, so it’s very strange.'

John returned to the store where he explained to shopkeeper Raj Thillay what had happened.

It turned out the eggs were from a farm in Mansfield.

John explained: 'Raj said he’d seen a double-yolker before but had never sold a half-dozen box of them.

'I doubt we’ll ever come across a box like that again. I think it’s just one of those things.'

The odds of winning the jackpot on the National Lottery are only one in 14 million.

Finding a double-yolker can often mean more than just duplicating your breakfast - as some people believe they are a sign of a marriage due to pregnancy, predictions of a windfall, the birth of twins and a death in the family.

Double-yolked eggs almost always come from young hens about 20-to-28 weeks old, experts say

Two years ago a pack of six eggs also turned out to be double-yolkers.

It happened to Jen Clarke, of the More or Less Team on Radio 4, and her friend Lynsey.

As they were making profiteroles, the two friends cracked four eggs 
one-by-one into a mixing bowl. The first was a double-yolker. The 
second, was also a double-yolker. With a sense of anticipation they 
crack the third - again a double yolker.

Surely not the fourth as well? As they cracked the final egg, another double-yolker fell into the mixing bowl.

It turned out the last two eggs in their box were also double-yolkers.

Richard Kempsey, an agriculture director at Stonegate, which supplies 
eggs to supermarkets, told BBC double-yolked eggs almost always come from
 young hens about 20-to-28 weeks old.

He said: 'In reality it gets its mechanics just slightly wrong. You 
get a young bird and it comes to lay its first egg and it releases more 
than one egg yolk. It forms a shell around the egg and out pops a rather
 large egg with two egg yolks in it.

'The chances of getting a double-yolk from one of these hens is much 
higher. One in every 100 eggs from these birds are double-yolk.

'We've also learned from our research that the eggs in a box 
are very likely to come from the same flock, and flocks are usually 
around the same age. On that basis we can say that while chance of 
finding one double-yolk egg may be 1/1000, the chance of finding a 
second is considerably higher - more like 1/100.'

So the event that occurred in Jen's kitchen was a 
billion-to-one event? Probably not, the BBC magazine wrote. There's another big factor we need 
to consider - the size of the eggs. Double-yolk eggs are far more likely
 to be large. Yet the eggs that young birds lay are normally small.

Any large eggs that are laid would be picked out and boxed 
together. This means if you find a large double-yolk egg - and you know 
the other eggs in the box are from the same young flock - then the 
chance that the other eggs are also double-yolkers becomes a lot more 
likely. In the most extreme case, you'd find that if the first egg is a 
double-yolker, all the eggs are double-yolkers.

So bearing all this in mind what happened when we went back 
to the last two eggs in Jen's box? Well as if to prove us right it 
turned out egg five and egg six were both double-yolkers.

On our initial naive reading this would be a 
one-in-a-quintillion double-yolk streak. But as with most things there's
 actually a more obvious explanation
