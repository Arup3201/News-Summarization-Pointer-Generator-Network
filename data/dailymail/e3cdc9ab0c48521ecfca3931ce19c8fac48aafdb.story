A Virginia college student has resorted to carrying around papers in order to prove she wears a headscarf because she’s Muslim.

Melona Clark wasn’t allowed to get her picture taken for a Hampton University ID card because of her choice to wear a hijab.

She had to get a letter from both the school’s chaplain and her Mosque to get permission to wear the head scarf on campus.

'Keep calm and wear a hijab': Student Melona Clark was told she must get written permission from both her chaplain and mosque in order to wear a hijab on Hampton University's campus in Virginia

And now that she has permission, Clark is carrying around the proof wherever she goes.

‘I don’t want to have to go through anything like I went through in the first place,’ Clark told WTKR.

It started when Clark got to the front of the ID card line and was told she would not be allowed to have her picture taken.

According to the rules at the institution, ‘caps and hoods for women’ are banned.

Excessive? Clark got permission to wear the symbol of her faith but believes the rule at the private, historically black university should be overturned

'I want to have all the proof that I can': Clark has decided to carry the papers at all times in order to show anyone who might question her right to be on campus

Since the historically black school is private, they are allowed to enforce a strict dress code.

However, they do allow women to wear ‘headgear considered as a part of religious or cultural dress’ so long as the student submits ‘a written request for a review through the Office of the Chaplain.’

The bureaucratic headache seemed excessive and unfair to Clark, but she went through the process anyway.

She hopes her school changes the rule, which she seems to think suggests a larger problem.

‘If I am ever stopped and asked who I am, what I am doing on campus,’ she said of her decision to carry the hijab permission slip. ‘I want to have all the proof that I can that I am a student here.'
