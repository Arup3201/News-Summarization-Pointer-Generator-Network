Many men are battling a paunch when they hit 30, but Cristiano Ronaldo isn't your average bloke.

The Real Madrid superstar hit that milestone on Thursday but he appears to be in better shape than ever before as he helps Carlo Ancelotti's side chase domestic and European success.

He proved as much in a revealing photoshoot for his new CR7 underwear collection, showing off the muscular physique which has helped him net an astonishing 28 goals in 18 La Liga games so far this season.

Ronaldo was forced to watch from the stands as Real beat Sevilla 2-1 at the Bernabeu on Wednesday night, completing a two-match ban for kicking out at Cordoba defender Edimar on January 24.

The former Manchester United man, who also threw a punch at Jose Angel Crespo in the same game, was shown a red card during his side's victory, but he's now available for the trip to rivals Atletico Madrid this weekend.

The Portuguese's new spring and summer range of underwear is the third he has released since launching his brand in 2013, although this time he has offered fans some handy hints on how to get a body just like his. 

Ronaldo's pearls of wisdom include tips on diet, exercise, sleep and relaxation, while he also reveals that he doesn't drink alcohol and opts for a steak with salad when eating out at restaurants.

His dedication to becoming the best player on the planet has also led to him being named the Premier League's greatest ever player in a recent survey.

Conducted by Usurv, the survey showed Ronaldo was the people's choice, finishing ahead of Thierry Henry and Ryan Giggs, who joined him on the fantasy podium.

Ronaldo was brought to Old Trafford by Sir Alex Ferguson as a raw 18-year-old in 2003, and departed for Real Madrid in 2009 with three Premier League titles, a Champions League medal and an FA Cup, and as the reigning FIFA World Player of the Year.

1. Learn to train your mind as well as your body. Mental strength is just as important as physical strength and will help you achieve your goals.

2. Be disciplined. Keeping yourself motivated and sticking to your routine is key. For me, there is no room for easing off so I have to be strict.

3. Set yourself goals. It will help to keep you focused and work towards something.

4. Working with a training partner is a good way to add a bit of competitiveness and help push yourself. If you train with someone who is a similar level to you then you will help push each other.

5. Proper sleep is really important for getting the most out of training. I go to bed early and get up early, especially before matches. Sleep helps muscles recover which is really important.

6. Warming up properly prevents injury. In training we do a few laps of the pitch, stretching and cardio warm up exercises. Make sure you do something similar in your training, even if it is jogging to the gym or a warm up on the treadmill or bicycle.

7. Mix it up. I recommend a combination of cardio (running and rowing) and weight training to ensure that workouts target all areas of the body and increase both strength and stamina. It also helps to keep it interesting.

8. High intensity is important to get your blood pumping and to increase stamina. We do a lot of sprinting drills in training and they can be incorporated into your workout whether you are in the gym or outdoors. Try and add it to every workout you do.

9. Cardio sessions are also key for building up endurance and stamina, and to stay trim. Try to do periods of around 30 minutes, increasing the number of sessions as you get stronger.

10. Fit in exercise wherever you can. You can do an abs workout in your bedroom when you wake up in the morning or before you go to bed. If you get into a routine then it makes it easier as it will become a habit.

11. A good workout must be combined with a good diet. I eat a high protein diet, with lots of wholegrain carbs, fruit and vegetables and avoid sugary foods. I love fish, especially the Portuguese dish bacalhau à braz, and at restaurants I’ll order a steak with salad.

12. Make sure you stay hydrated. Drinking water is so important. I also avoid alcohol.

13. Eat regularly. If you train regularly it’s important to keep energy levels high to fuel your body for better performance. I sometimes eat up to six smaller meals a day to make sure I have enough energy to perform each session at top level.

14. I always make sure I have good music to listen to. It helps you zone out, get motivated and do your best. I like to listen to hip hop and reggaeton.

15. Relax. Training and physical sessions are most important, but living a relaxed lifestyle helps you to be the best you can be, physically and mentally. I spend my free time with family and friends, which keeps me relaxed and in a positive mind-set.
