Connecticut police say a convenience store clerk has been critically injured trying to stop the theft of two signs featuring images of actor David Hasselhoff.

Authorities say the 36-year-old clerk at a Cumberland Farms in Shelton saw a man put the signs into an SUV shortly after 1 a.m. Tuesday. Police say the worker was struck and dragged by the SUV and landed on his head.

According to the police, the driver of the SUV pulled up next to the two life-sized Hoffs, cut them off the light pole they were attached to and put them in the trunk of his vehicle.

The clerk, seeing what happened, then approached the SUV to get the signs back but was struck when the vehicle sped away.

Police
say the clerk is hospitalized in critical condition, and authorities 
are looking for the suspects. The employee's name hasn't been released.

Just a few days ago, the actor tweeted a video of one of the signs attached to an airplane, flying above a crowd on a beach

'Thanks to @cumberlandfarms and Jeff! You guys rock! What a cool banner,' he wrote.

Hasselhoff starred in the TV shows 'Baywatch' and 'Knight Rider.'

The signs featuring him advertise iced coffee. Cumberland Farms officials say more than 500 of them have been stolen from stores in several states in recent months.

Accompanying the TV ads were cutout ads featuring Hasselhoff that were distributed to the 570 Cumberland stores throughout New England and Florida.

The ads became cult hits for thieves and by July there were only 20 left in the entire country, Cumberland Farms brand strategy specialist Kate Ngo told the AP in July.
