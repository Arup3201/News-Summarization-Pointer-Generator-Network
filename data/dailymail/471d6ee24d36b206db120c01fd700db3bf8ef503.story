England's Oliver Wilson has been named the European Tour golfer of the month for October following his stunning victory in the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship.

Wilson was ranked 792nd in the world and only playing on a sponsor's invite when he held off the likes of four-time major winner Rory McIlroy to win his first European Tour title at St Andrews.

'It's the first time I've managed to win this,' said Wilson, who had previously finished runner-up nine times on the European Tour.

'It's obviously been a great month for me and it's nice to back it up with the Golfer of the Month award. It's another little memento of what I've achieved.'

Wilson played in the BMW masters this week, where he finished 56th, winning €27,600 in prize money.
