When the government shut down Tuesday after Congress couldn't pass a federal budget, many brought up the question of how our founding fathers would have reacted to such a stalemate.

One thing's for sure - they wouldn't have wanted City Tavern to close.

Called the 'most genteel tavern in America' by future-President John Adams, the original City Tavern was a popular hangout for the Founding Fathers.

Sorry we're closed: City Tavern in Philadelphia has been forced to close and cancel more than 300 reservations with the government shutdown

Revolutionary restaurant: The original City Tavern was built in 1773 and became a popular haunt for America's Founding Fathers who dined here often when attending the First and Second Continental Congresses as well as the Constitutional Convention

The original tavern was demolished in 1854, but rebuilt in the 1970s for the Bicentennial and operates as a restaurant serving Colonial-era fare in the Old City section of Philadelphia.

While the tavern is privately-operated, it has had to temporarily close because the building is owned by the U.S. National Parks Service and the restaurant is inside Independence National Historical Park.

Because the national park has had to close, the restaurant was informed that it couldn't stay open.

This came as a surprise to those at the restaurant, as City Tavern was allowed to stay open the last time there was a government shutdown,  17 years ago.

Regulars: The Founding Fathers dined every Saturday at the City Tavern while convening for the Second Continental Congress

'We were somewhat shocked when we received the news today that we would have to close at 3pm,' Molly Yun, City Tavern's public relations director told NBC Philadelphia yesterday. 'Unfortunately, we're going to have to stay closed until the government reopens and our hands are tied.'

The restaurant has had to cancel more than 300 reservations for the next four days, including a party of 200, which has made many patrons 'angry' and 'aggravated'.

The restaurant estimates that they could lose hundreds of thousands of dollars if the shutdown continues into the weekend, and it may lead their staff to look for other work.
