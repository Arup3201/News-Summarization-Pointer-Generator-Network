Hit: Contestants from ITV1 show Take Me Out (not pictured here) were thrown out of a £1.5million country mansion after a weekend long party got out of hand and police were called

Contestants from ITV dating show Take Me Out were thrown out of a country hotel after a weekend long party got out of hand and police were called.

The party, said to have been attended by some 100 revellers who had taken part in the ITV1 show, decended into a drink-fuelled orgy as contestants played strip pool ran riot.

Former contestants from all five of the show's series paid £55 each to attend the weekend long bash at Castle Hill House in Tutbury, Staffordshire.

But their fun was cut short on Saturday morning when police were called and the owners of the house decided to evict them.

One party-goer told The Sun: 'Everyone got really drunk early on and it started to get out of hand.

'Things heated up when some lads and girls decided to play strip pool.

'The girls were naked within minutes and just parading around.'

Organised by two contestants, the £1.5million eight bedroom house, which is situated close to the banks of the River Dove, had been privately rented for the party.

The ITV show, fronted by Paddy McGuinness, was first aired in 2010, with series five starting its run last night.

The show averaged just over three million viewers during the fourth series.

Police confirmed that they were called to Castle Hill House, but no one was arrested in connection with the incident.

The show is no stranger to controversial headlines.

Last year, contestant Charles Sherwin was subjected to a barrage of vile abuse on Twitter after appearing on the show.

One Twitter user even threatened to bottle the unpopular contestant.

Another contestant, Aaron Withers, who appeared on the show in January last year, was revealed to be a £50-an-hour male escort, with a profile on website Platinum Select, an agency which features the profile of more than 5,000 escorts.

Mr Withers insisted that he never offered any services to clients beyond escorting.

It was also revealed that he had been convicted of assaulting a woman in a bar in 2010.

It was reported last January that around 90 former contestants of the show trashed a £4.5million mansion in Chepstow, South Wales.

Photographs of that party were posted on Facebook and sources said there was 'lots of sh******', while another source claimed that there was two or three thousand pounds worth of damage done to the Grade II listed building.
