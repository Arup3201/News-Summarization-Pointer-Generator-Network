Distin has missed the last four matches but he could feature against the French side in the Stade Pierre-Mauroy as boss Roberto Martinez rotates his squad.

'Distin's involved, he is training but at the moment we have a lot of games and he needs to fight for his place,' said Martinez. 

'He is an important player to the squad but he has been on the sidelines for a long time.'
