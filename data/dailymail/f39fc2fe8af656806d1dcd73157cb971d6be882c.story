The British Royal Family is a favourite target of French celebrity magazines.

Twenty years ago, at another private villa in the South of France, Sarah Ferguson found herself in the paparazzi viewfinder.

Lying topless on a sun-lounger, she was photographed having her toes sucked by her Texan financial adviser, John Bryan.

Publication of the images spelled the end of her marriage to the Duke of York and signalled the start of a frenzied pursuit of the royals by French photographers, which culminated in the death of Diana in Paris.

A year after the infamous Fergie snaps, the French magazine Paris Match and a photographer were ordered to pay her and Bryan the relatively trifling sum of £84,000 for taking the poolside photographs of them without their permission.

Snapped naked: A naked photo of Prince Charles at a friend's chateau near Avignon was published in Paris Match and German paper Bild in 1994

Then, in 1994, it was the turn of the 
Prince of Wales. A photograph of him naked on holiday at a friend’s 
chateau near Avignon was published in Paris Match and the German paper 
Bild. It showed Charles standing at a window of his room after going 
swimming with only a white towelling robe thrown over his shoulder.

Other pictures in the French magazine showed the Prince on a sun-lounger in swimming trunks and dark glasses. 

The prince had spent time at the chateau every summer and been pictured through the same window four years earlier by a platoon of paparazzi who had their long lenses trained on him from a nearby olive grove.

His detectives had supervised the setting up of a ‘privacy screen’ in the chateau grounds but at least one photographer beat the security. Royal aides yesterday accused Closer magazine of ‘turning the clocks back 15 years’ – a reference to the time when paparazzi chased Diana around the world for pictures. It ended with her death in an underpass in Paris in 1997.

The Princess of Wales had been photographed in an amorous clinch with Dodi Fayed in a yacht off the French Riviera days before the couple flew to the French capital. On their arrival, they were pursued by photographers in cars and on motorbikes and ended up at the Ritz hotel.

Pictures as they died: Paparazzi were followed Diana and Dodi Fayed when their car crashed, killing them both. Photographers took pictures f her as she lay dying

They left by a back exit, again followed by paparazzi, and Diana, who was 36, and Fayed, 41, died after the Mercedes S280 in which they were travelling ran head-on into the central reservation of the Alma underpass. Photographers took pictures of her as she lay dying.

In 2008, after a six month hearing, an inquest jury concluded Diana and Dodi were ‘unlawfully killed’ as a direct result of drunk chauffeur Henri Paul’s driving and the actions of photographers hounding their car. Both Paul, who also died, and the photographers were to blame for the crash because of their ‘gross negligence.’ 

But the paparazzi – ten of whom were arrested after the crash – did not face fresh legal proceedings in France, as a police investigation cleared them of criminal responsibility.
