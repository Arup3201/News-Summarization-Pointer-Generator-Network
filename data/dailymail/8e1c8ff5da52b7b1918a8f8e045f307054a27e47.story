Oceanographer Dr Tim Boyd, 54, died after being hit by a bolt of lightning on Sunday as he walked his dog

A scientist has died after apparently being struck by lightning as he walked his dog.

Internationally respected oceanographer Dr Tim Boyd, 54, was found by a passer-by after being hit by a bolt on the Jubilee Bridge, near his home in Port Appin, Argyll, on Sunday.

Emergency services were called but they were unable to save the American-born scientist.

The father-of-two worked at the Scottish Association of Marine Science (Sams) in Oban.

It is the second tragedy to hit the association in just over a week. 

Christopher Bell, 24, a PhD student who worked at Sams, was one of four people killed in the Glencoe avalanche on January 19.

A spokesman for the association said they are 'grief-stricken about the tragic death' of Dr Boyd.

He said: 'We suffer deep pain and confusion to lose such a lively and warm friend and colleague.

'Our
hearts go out in particular to his wife and his two talented daughters 
he was so very, very proud of. Our thoughts are with his family.'

Dr Boyd joined Sams in 2007 from Oregon State University and was a well-respected physical oceanographer 'with internationally recognised expertise in Arctic oceanography'.

The association spokesman added: 'Thanks to his outgoing personality and easy-going nature he established himself quickly as a key researcher at Sams.

'Tim was also a talented lecturer who will be sorely missed by his students.

'Tim Boyd pursued his research work with 
passion and integrity and was always willing to advise and support 
colleagues.

'He truly enjoyed his science and we will all miss our 
discussions with him. Tim was a man of energy and generosity who will be
deeply missed by friends and colleagues near and far.

'We all feel loss and hurt, and will always remember the contributions he made to oceanography, Arctic science and Sams.'

Another colleague said last night that about 200 people work at the association but that it is a 'tight-knit group'.

The
colleague told the Daily Record: 'We were just trying to get to grips 
with the news of the death of Chris in the avalanche and now Tim has 
died as well.

'It's two awful tragedies - and our thoughts obviously go out to the families of both Chris and Tim.'

A large storm in the area at the time knocked down power and phone lines and it is understood he was struck by lightning.

A Strathclyde Police spokeswoman said:
'Police were called to a report of the sudden death of a 54-year-old 
man in Port Appin, Argyll, around 1.25pm on Sunday.

'There
would appear to be no suspicious circumstances; however, a post mortem 
will be carried out in due course to establish the exact cause of death.
A full report will be sent to the procurator fiscal.'

Dr Boyd pioneered the development of the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle technology programme at Sams.

Sams director Professor Laurence Mee told staff in an email that Dr Boyd had been killed by a lightning strike, according to The Record. 

It read: 'We are all very shaken by this and we will do everything possible to help Tim's family, for whom this is devastating.'

On average, about three people die from lightning strikes in the UK each year, and between 30 and 60 people are hit.
