Babysitter: Georgina Spicer, 20, of Edwardstone, Suffolk, wept as she told JPs she had only been told she was in charge of the family's one-year-old son

A babysitter was taken to court after her employer’s dog attacked the next-door neighbour and her cat.

Georgina Spicer, 20, said it was unfair that she was blamed after Tizzy the Jack Russell terrier went berserk  while she was looking after its owner’s one-year-old son.

She was babysitting at the home of the little boy’s mother, Cally Marsh.

The mother’s two dogs – Tizzy and a spaniel – escaped when the boy opened the door to the garden.

Miss Spicer, who was hanging out the washing, tried desperately to get the dogs back but they charged into the garden of neighbour Melanie Richardson.

Tizzy repeatedly bit Miss Richardson – who received eight puncture wounds to her left arm.

The dog then launched a ‘frenzied’ attack on her pet cat, which later died of its injuries.Spicer admitted being in charge of the dog after it badly injured Miss Richardson.

Wayne Ablett, prosecuting, said Miss Richardson had to use  a stick to protect herself from the dog and needed medical treatment after the incident in the village  of Edwardstone, near  Sudbury, Suffolk.

Miss Spicer, who represented herself in court, wept as she told the magistrates: ‘I was only responsible for the one-year-old. That was all I was told.

‘There was no prior arrangement for me to look after the dogs.’

The student tried to change her plea to not guilty at Bury St Edmunds magistrates’ court, and broke down and cried when she was refused permission because she had no new evidence.

She said: ‘I think it’s very unfair I’m getting blamed for this. I was only the babysitter.’

Chairman of the magistrates, Marian de Bass, gave Spicer a six-month conditional discharge, explaining: ‘You must realise that at the time you were in charge of the household which included a small child and two dogs.

‘However, the garden had not been made secure and therefore the incident happened.’ Spicer was also ordered to pay £300  compensation, £40 costs and a £15 victim surcharge.

An order was also made for Tizzy to be destroyed within two months.

‘This dog killed a cat, injured a person who needed medical  treatment and was known to have escaped before on several  occasions and killed a chicken and possibly more,’ the chief  magistrate said.

Within those two months Tizzy must be kept on a lead and muzzle in public, or kept locked up in a secure environment.

The Jack Russell is also banned from the village of Edwardstone. The court heard it was being kept in a secure kennel.

After the hearing yesterday, Miss Spicer, who is studying equine sports therapy, said she wanted to warn ‘every babysitter’ of the risks of looking after a child when there is a pet in the house.
