A teenager has become the second person to die after apparently overdosing during a music festival in the U.S.

Police say a 17-year-old boy from northern Virginia, has now died of a suspected overdose following Friday's 'Mad Decent Block Party' event at Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia, Maryland.

The youngster, who has not been identified, was one of about 20 people taken to hospital late on Friday. Many of them had drug-related symptoms.

Another man, 20-year-old Tyler Fox Viscardi of Raleigh, North Carolina, was rushed to hospital and pronounced dead at a hospital that night.

Officers are still not clear about what drugs were taken. 

Police, who say the men did not know each other, are awaiting toxicology results following the deaths.

In a statement following Tyler Fox Viscardi's death, Concert promoter Seth Hurwitz, said: 'Our hearts go out to the family as they face the unimaginable.

'As a parent, it makes me horribly sad beyond words to think of a tragedy like this. We can spend every minute of the day making perfect sense to our children regarding the obvious perils of drugs, but sometimes it is impossible to convince them that this is relevant to their world.'

American DJ Diplo took to Twitter after learning of the death of Tyler Fox Viscardi

According to Rollingstone.com, police arrested three people at the show. One for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, one for domestic assault and one for assaulting an officer.

Around 50 citations were also handed out for under-age drinking.

Friday’s concert included performances by Diplo, Sleigh Bells, Flux Pavilion and Wolfgang Gartner.

Diplo later took to Twitter to say: 'Our hearts go out to everyone impacted by yesterday’s event. we are truly devastated.'
