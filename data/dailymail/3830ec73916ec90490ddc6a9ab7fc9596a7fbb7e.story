Harry Kane's brace secured the north London derby bragging rights for Tottenham at White Hart Lane on Saturday afternoon. 

Mesut Ozil had given Arsenal a dream start with his 11th minute strike but Kane stepped up in the second-half to settle the contest as Spurs stormed to a 2-1 victory. 

Here, Sportsmail's Sami Mokbel rates each player as Mauricio Pochettino's side saw off their London rivals.

TOTTENHAM (4-2-3-1)

Hugo Lloris - 6.5 

A spectator for large chunks of the afternoon but was ready when called upon.

Kyle Walker - 7 

Spent the majority of his afternoon supplementing his side's attacking options than defending such was Spurs' dominance. 

Danny Rose (left) puts in a strong challenge on Arsenal forward Danny Welbeck 

Eric Dier - 7

Surprise inclusion in place of Fazio, didn't have the busiest of afternoons but stood firm at the end.

Jan Vertonghen - 7.5 

Organised his back-four well and coped with Giroud's physical presence for the most part. 

Danny Rose - 6.5 

Poor defending for Arsenal's first before becoming embroiled in an unnecessary tussle with Welbeck. 

Erik Lamela (left) was industrious against Arsenal but lacked a creative edge in the final third 

Nabil Bentaleb - 8 

Straight back in the team after returning from AFCON and looked assured in the heat of battle. 

Ryan Mason - 7.5 

Wasteful in possession at times but ran his heart out on an intense afternoon at the Lane.

Erik Lamela - 6.5 

Worked incredibly hard in pressing Arsenal but lacked a creative edge in Spurs' attacking third. 

Christian Eriksen (left) had a quiet afternoon by his own high standards but his deliveries were still top class 

Moussa Dembele - 6.5 

Brilliant one minute, dreadful the next. Solid on the whole, but can do so much more. 

Christian Eriksen - 6.5 

Not his most influential afternoon but the quality of some of his deliveries were exceptional. 

Harry Kane - 9 

His first goals in a North London Derby. It'll be the first of many. Spurs' hero again.

Subs

Chadli - 6 (for Dembele 75) 

Stambouli - 6 (on for Lamela 88) 

Mauricio Pochettino - 8 

Will be delighted with his side's display. Big afternoon for the Argentine. 

ARSENAL (4-2-3-1)

David Ospina - 7 

Took an early blow but recovered to deny Spurs on several occasions. 

Hector Bellerin - 6.5 

Struggled to contain Eriksen and Rose down Spurs' left, left exposed by Welbeck. 

Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina impressed despite being twice beaten by Kane 

Per Mertesacker - 7 

Looks so much more comfortable alongside Koscielny. Stood up well to bundles of Spurs pressure.

Laurent Koscielny - 7 

A tower of strength for the Gunners in defence but lost Kane for Spurs' second. 

Nacho Monreal -  6.5 

Did well in keeping Lamela's threat to a minimum. No frills display from the left back.

Laurent Koscielny (right) was a tower of strength in the centre of defence for the Gunners 

Francis Coquelin - 7.5 

Has been a revelation in recent weeks and did so much of Arsenal's dirty work again. 

Aaron Ramsey - 6 

Couldn't get to grips with the game as Spurs dominated the game in the middle of the park.

Mesut Ozil - 6.5

Third goal in as many games, but not enough to save his team. 

Welbeck (left) played a crucial part in his side's opening goal but could have been better defensively 

Santi Cazorla (left) shows his frustration during the game; the Spaniard was replaced in the second-half 

Santi Cazorla - 6 

Couldn't replicate the dazzling displays of recent weeks. Replaced in the second half.

Danny Welbeck - 6.5 

Returning from injury, the forward played a crucial role in the Gunners' opener but could have done more defensively. 

Olivier Giroud - 6 

Played a (lucky) part in Arsenal's opener, but this wasn't his best afternoon. 

Mesut Ozil (left) wheels away to celebrate after his 11th minute strike gave Arsenal an early lead 

Subs: Rosicky - (for Cazorla 67); Walcott - 6 (for Welbeck 77); Akpom 6 (for Coquelin 88); Paulinho - 6 (for Mason 90) 

Arsene Wenger -  6.5 

Will have hurt to see his side dominated by Spurs.
