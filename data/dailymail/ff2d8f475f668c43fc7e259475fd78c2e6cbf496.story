The woman who survived a vicious attack, during which her ex-partner hacked her arms off with a samurai sword, has written a book about the horrific ordeal and her inspiring recovery.

Simonne Butler, 39, from Auckland had both her arms reattached by doctors after they were cut off by killer Antoine Dixon.

Dixon also attacked Ms Butler's friend Renee Gunbie, whose left-hand was cut off and could not be reattached, before he went on a drug-fuelled crime spree in January 2003. Ms Butler and Ms Gunbie were left for dead by Dixon and paramedics called to the scene said they were minutes away from dying when they arrived.

Antoine Dixon was convicted for murder, shooting at a police officer, wounding, aggravated robbery and kidnapping in relation to the attack in 2003

Dixon then murdered  a man at an Auckland petrol station in a spray of bullets from a machine gun, before taking another man hostage and engaging in a standoff with police.

Dixon, who had taken methamphetamine during the day of the crimes, eventually surrendered to police and was sentenced to life in prison with a 20 year non-parole period. He died in prison in 2009, from what were believed to be self-inflicted injuries.

More than 11 years after the horrific events, Ms Butler has written a book about the ordeal and her physical and emotional healing.

'It was the most intense moment – or five minutes, or however long it lasted – of my life,' Ms Butler told Daily Mail Australia. 'It could be the defining moment [of my life]. But I think my healing journey is what's defined me as a person, rather than the incident.'

Between 2003 and 2008, Ms Butler underwent 12 general anaesthetic surgeries and about 100 procedures to reattach and repair her arms.

'It wasn't a really sharp samurai sword that just sliced my arms off. It took five, six, seven, maybe ten hacks to get them off,' she said.

The bones in her left arm were smashed so severely that she required a bone graft from her hips to reconnect the bones. She still has very little function in her left hand and is only able to move her wrist and thumb a few millimetres.

Her right hand was sliced vertically in half and her forearm was chopped diagonally, though was not completely severed, and after multiple surgeries and years of physiotherapy she now has between 60 and 70 percent of normal function in her right hand.

Ms Butler was in a relationship with her attacker Antoine Dixon for five years and had separated from him when he went on a violent rampage, ending with him murdering a man at a petrol station

The physical healing process has been incredibly demanding, but the emotional recovery has proved even more challenging.

Ms Butler says it took her years to deal with the emotional trauma of the attack, as well as the five-year abusive relationship she had with Dixon before it occurred.

'I was ashamed and embarrassed and it took me years to deal with that. For me, the emotional side of it was forgiving myself. I'd done so many dumb things, made so many bad choices and put myself in danger so many times. I didn't have the self-respect to say, "You can't treat me like that,"' she said.

Ms Butler said she was not surprised that Dixon, who had stalked her for six months before they started dating and been physically abusive to her throughout the relationship, was capable of such violence.

'He used to threaten to slit my grandparents' throats in the night and burn down their house,' she said. 'It ended up being a very sick and twisted cycle in my head that I deserved to be punished for making the terrible decision to be with him.'

After the incident she had 'lots and lots' of panic attacks.

'Whether it was over going out in public, or about the thought of him getting out of jail and finding me, not even finding me to be violent, just showing up with a silly big grin,' she said.

Ms Butler's left arm was so badly damaged in the attack that she can only move her fingers a few millimetres. Her right arm has 60 to 70 percent function

She hit a low point in 2007, when Dixon's conviction for murder, wounding, kidnapping, shooting at police and aggravated burglary was overturned due to a mistrial.

'When I found out there was a mistrial I had such a panic, I didn't understand what had happened, I expected him to turn up at my house,' she said.

Dixon was convicted a second time in 2008 after a re-trial and died in prison, from what were believed to be self-inflicted injuries, in 2009 at the age of 41.

When Ms Butler learnt he was dead, she felt incredibly liberated.

'I was dancing around my house with joy. I felt so light and so free and really amazing,' she said.

But Ms Butler has put the terrifying ordeal behind her and is moving on with her life.

'It's a long time ago now,' she said. 'I don't think about him or even the incident. I've got so much going on.'

Ms Butler says she does not think about the attack or her former partner, because she has too much going on in her life

Since the attack, Ms Butler has taken up horse-riding, completed her diploma in naturopathy and is half-way through a course in flower essence therapy and a shamanic apprenticeship with a master shaman

Since the attack, Ms Butler has taken up horse-riding, completed her diploma in naturopathy and is half-way through a course in flower essence therapy and a shamanic apprenticeship with a master shaman.

On top of this she has just finished writing a book about her experience, titled Recalibrate.

'That's what I did to myself. I had to fully recalibrate my mind, my body, myself,' she said.

She plans to self-publish the book with Mary Egan Publishing and she is currently crowd-funding the final stages of the book's production.

Despite everything she has achieved, Ms Butler acknowledges that she cannot help but continue to be affected by the traumatic events of her past.

'I'm so much better, but I haven't been in a long-term relationship yet. I had two six months flings with boys I could very much control. I like to think I'm fearless, but I think it is [fear] that holds me back.

'I made such a terrible mess the last time I fell in love.'

For the meantime, Ms Butler's love is reserved for her supportive family and friends – 'I live in a perpetual state of gratitude for all the amazing people I have in my life' – and for her work.

'[The book] has been a labour of love. This is the first step, my launching pad so I can go out and do really good things in the world.'
