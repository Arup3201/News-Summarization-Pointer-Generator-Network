Clara McKinty, 90, was left to sit on a plastic chair in A&E for more than eight hours after suffering a suspected stroke

A 90-year-old was left to sit on a plastic chair in A&E for more than eight hours after suffering a suspected stroke.

Clara McKinty, known as Joan, was told it was a 'usual day' after her long wait to receive treatment at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff.

She was struggling to talk and complained to doctors of a pounding headache – both common stroke symptoms – but was not given priority.

A stroke is a life-threatening medical emergency and urgent treatment is essential because the sooner a person receives treatment, the less damage is likely to happen.

The 90-year-old arrived at 5.30pm, but she was not seen until seen by a doctor until 11pm.

She then returned to her seat to wait until 2am and was placed on a trolley bed for the night until her diagnosis in the morning.

'I think it's disgusting and ridiculous. I got in there at 5.30pm and just sat, and sat, and sat,' she said.

'There were quite a few other people who were also waiting just as long as me, maybe even longer.

'But nobody came up to us to explain why it was taking so long. My son went up to the nurses four times, but they just said it was a 'usual' day.

'They said there were people the other side of the wall who were also waiting just as long. I was just relieved to be seen in the end.'

Her son Kevin drove for an hour from his Swansea home to escort her to A&E after Mrs McKinty was told it would take three hours for an ambulance to pick her up and make a 30-minute journey.

She was given a brain scan the following morning and a consultant confirmed she had not suffered a stroke and was free to return home

Mr McKinty said an elderly potential stroke sufferer should not be left waiting in such conditions. 

'Nobody offered communication or anything to eat or drink,' he said. 'I got the impression from nurses that this was an average night and just "one of those things" you put up with.

'To sit on a plastic chair for an hour or so is hard, but she was on one for more than eight.'

She was given a brain scan the following morning and a consultant confirmed she had not suffered a stroke and was free to return home.

New NHS guidelines say that 95 per cent of patients should be seen within four hours of arriving at A&E. 

A spokeswoman for Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said: 'The Medical Assessment Unit can be extremely busy and we aim to treat all patients as soon as possible, with priority given to patients with the most urgent need.

'We are sorry to hear about the family's concerns and would urge them to contact us to discuss further.'

Strokes occur when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off. 

If you suspect that you or someone else is having a stroke, phone 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance.

Face – the face may have dropped on one side, the person may not be able to smile or their mouth or eye may have dropped.

Arms – the person with suspected stroke may not be able to lift both arms and keep them there because of arm weakness or numbness in one arm.

Speech – their speech may be slurred or garbled, or the person may not be able to talk at all despite appearing to be awake.

Time – it is time to dial 999 immediately if you see any of these signs or symptoms.
