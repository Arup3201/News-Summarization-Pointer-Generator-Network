Nike have unveiled their latest football, under the name of 'Ordem', which will be used in three of the biggest leagues in Europe - England's Premier League, Spain's La Liga and Italy's Serie A.

Each league will use a different colour variation of the ball, with the the Premier League taking the blue edition while La Liga has the orange and Serie A the pink.

According to the sportswear company, the Ordem is Nike’s 'most innovative, technologically advanced and aerodynamically tuned ball to date'.

The ball consists of 12 fuse-welded panels in a three-layer casing system, and a poly-blend wrapped, free-floating carbon latex bladder.

The Ordem also features so-called AEROW TRAC grooves, Nike Football’s latest innovation. The grooves are engineered to grip and channel the air to produce the truest trajectory and most consistent flight, which help ensure stability and accuracy in mid-air.

The ball will be available from July 17 and priced at around £95.
