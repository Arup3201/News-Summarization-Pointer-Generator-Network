A woolly mammoth known as Yuka is to go on show to the public in Taipei, Taiwan from today.

The three-metre long female mammoth died at the age of 10 and was discovered in Siberia in 2010.

The prehistoric animal is thought to have lived 39,000 years ago, and her perfectly preserved body was discovered in the frozen ground by tusk-hunters, who handed it over to scientists.

Measuring three-metre long the female mammoth was 10 when she died.

Her frozen body was discovered in Siberia in 2010.

She is thought to have roamed the frozen plains 39,000 years ago.

Marks on her body including a long cut from her head to the centre of her back and an 'unusual patterned opening' on her right flank, suggest that cave men hunted the animals.

The mammoth appears to have escaped another predator at an earlier stage as it had a broken leg and other injuries.

Mammoths evolved from African elephants when the Ice Age set in.

They were around twice the size of today's elephants and weighed up to eight tonnes.

Their long tusks helped them fight predators and pick grass and shrubs out of the ice.

Visitors to the exhibition, called THE FROZEN WOOLLY MAMMOTH, will be able to see Yuka's remarkable ginger coat up close.

The woolly mammoth goes on show at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in Taipei today.

While many bones have been found 
before – so scientists have an idea of how the legendary creatures looked when 
they roamed the icy plains –  Yuka is unique in being an almost complete carcass.

A long straight cut stretches from the animal's head to the centre of its back and there is an 'unusual patterned 
opening' on the right flank made of small serrations as if from a 
primitive saw-like tool.

This skilful butchery could not have been the 
work of a predator such as a lion and was probably the work of cavemen living during the Ice Age.

Although mammoths featured in cave 
paintings from the time, this is the first evidence that humans preyed 
on them in the days when ice sheets covered 40 per cent of the northern 
hemisphere.

The find suggests humans may have 
contributed to their extinction, before the creatures were finally wiped
out in the great thaw ten millennia ago.

The mammoth appears to have escaped another predator at an earlier stage as it had a
broken leg and other injuries, which suggest an epic struggle.

Daniel Fisher, professor of earth and
environmental sciences at the University of Michigan and a world expert
on mammoths, said: 'There is dramatic evidence of a life-and-death 
struggle between Yuka and some top predator, probably a lion. Even more 
interesting, there are hints that humans may have taken over the kill at
an early stage.

'Were humans using the lions to catch mammoths and then moving the lions off their kill?'

Yuka has been preserved in spectacularly good condition and is the first mammoth carcasss to be pulled from the ice with its ginger fur still attached

The discovery of Yuka has been described as being of 'huge significance' and could be the first direct evidence of early humans having attacked woolly mammoths. The prehistoric creature's carcass with its ginger fur (pictured right) is also the first of its kind ever found

Scientists could dissect Yuka or use 
infrared scanning to look at its organs and understand how mammoths 
managed to adapt to the harsh conditions. Using the body tissue, which 
is normally lost, they can also use the latest technology to analyse its
genome, raising the possibility of cloning a mammoth from the remains.

Bernard Buiges, of the organisation 
Mammathus, obtained the carcass, from 
the Siberian tusk hunters.

He is confident that they were not 
responsible for removing the bones and that it was the work of Man. The 
incredible find was shown in detail on the BBC2 programme Woolly 
Mammoth: Secrets from the Ice earlier this year.

The remains were found by Siberian hunters and handed over to the Mammuthus science organisation

The presenter, anatomist and 
broadcaster Professor Alice Roberts, of Birmingham University, said it 
was like a 'time machine into the past' , adding: 'It just doesn't look 
like an animal which died 10,000 years ago. It looks so fresh, almost 
alive. It's a historic moment.'

Professor Adrian Lister of the 
Natural History Museum said: 'This looks like one of the most complete 
mammoth carcasses we've ever found.

'The vast majority of fossils are just
bones and teeth because that's what survives under the ground. So to 
find a complete carcass with all its flesh and skin and hair like this, 
it can only happen in the very far north of Siberia.'
