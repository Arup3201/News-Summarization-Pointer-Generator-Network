A half-brother to 2010 King George winner Harbinger, sired by Galileo, topped the Tattersalls Book One sale when sold to a bid of 2.6million guineas (£2.73m) from Coolmore Stud supremo John Magnier on Thursday,

More than 79m guineas (£82.95m), a new record, was spent over the three-day auction in Newmarket, 17m-plus guineas by Sheik Mohammed's bloodstock adviser John Ferguson.

After an extremely slow start, when he was even available for the minimum bid of 5,000 guineas, the Ashbrittle Stud-consigned youngster eventually reached an incredible 2.6million guineas when the hammer went down to Magnier after a battle with John Warren.

'When the bidding opened at 5,000 guineas, I just wanted the ground to open up,' said Ginny Whales, who led up and had looked after the colt at Ashbrittle.

'When it stuck again at 60,000, I thought the boss was bound to sack me - how could we have got it so wrong! I am just delighted and amazed at the price.'

The colt is reported to be the world's most expensive yearling sold this year.

John Ferguson, bloodstock adviser to Sheikh Mohammed, had made three six-figure signings on Wednesday and he beat Al Shaqab Racing to Lot 398.

'He came to us in July and was always a stunning, straightforward colt, always easy to deal with and always oozed class,' said Charlie Vigors of consigners Hillwood Stud.

'It is easily our biggest sale and it is a fantastic feeling.'

The day started off briskly when James Delahooke spent 1.25million on a Galileo three-quarters sister to Derby winner Pour Moi.

'She was my pick of the sale,' Delahooke told Tattersalls' website.

'I tried very hard to buy a filly by Bernardini filly earlier this summer, but was beaten by John Ferguson.

'This is the nicest filly I have seen since - she ticks all the boxes, she is gorgeous. She is for Bobby Flay and will probably race in Europe.'
