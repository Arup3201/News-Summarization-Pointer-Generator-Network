Detectives have also begun a separate inquiry into the death of Lillian Williams

Police have launched an investigation into allegations of neglect at a hospital in South Wales and arrested three nurses over falsification of patient records. 

The three nurses, a man and a woman in their 40s and a 29-year-old woman have been suspended and are on police bail. 

Detectives have also begun a separate inquiry into the death of Lillian Williams, an 82-year-old amputee.

Her family claim she was neglected on several occasions when she was admitted four times at two hospitals before she died in November 2012.

On
 one occasion they called the police to say Ms Williams was being 
'killed' by Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend and that other 
patients were at risk.

Her son Gareth Williams, 54, a retired teacher from Porthcawl, Glamorgan, said: 'We stayed with her round the clock because of previous neglect. But she was still neglected. We couldn't believe what we were seeing.'

Miss Williams, who raised five children on her own, was admitted to Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend three times where she stayed on two different wards and Port Talbot Hospital once between August 2010 and November 2012.

Her family say her dentures were 'welded' to the roof of her mouth because they were not removed at night which caused her to develop mouth ulcers.

Staff have also been accused of not taking off her artificial leg to prevent sores.

It is also alleged that she was deprived of fluid for days and became seriously dehydrated.

Allegations: Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend where Lillian Williams was admitted

On one occasion she was put on nil by mouth in error and because it was the weekend no doctor could be found to change the instructions.

After more than a month in hospital in 2012 she got very weak and doctors told the family she had pneumonia and that they were going to withdraw support, all food, drink and drugs.

They say her death was painful and agonising. The family queried the pneumonia diagnosis by a consultant. And they say two junior doctors told them they doubted the diagnosis.

The pensioner died in November 2012 four days after having medical support withdrawn.A post mortem revealed her death was not due to pneumonia.

It was put down to a heart attack, probably caused by withdrawal of anti-blood clot medication.

Following an inspection in 2012 of the Princess of Wales Hospital as well as other allegations, the NHS is reviewing the care of patients at the Bro Morgannwg Health Board in South Wales. 

Peter Walsh, chief executive of Action Against Medical Accidents, said: 'We have heard from a number of people with serious concerns about the care at the hospital and the way that complaints have been handled. 

'And we are concerned that the review which has been ordered is inadequate and will not get to the root causes of the problem.' 

A spokesman for the trust said: 'We would like to again offer sincere condolences to the family of Mrs Williams and apologise for poor care we have identified that Mrs Willims recieved from ABMU Health Board.

'We are currently unable to comment of specific aspects of this case due to ongoing police investigations. 

'We apologise sincerley to patients and families who we have let down at the Princess of Wales Hospital.'

Last week a separate investigation was launched into the Princess of Wales Hospital after the death of another patient who died after being kept in an ambulance for four hours outside the A&E department
