A wealthy parking-lot magnate has been accused of giving his model girlfriend herpes after promising her he was clean of all sexually transmitted diseases, it emerged today.

The unnamed Soho model is suing William Lerner, 57, who owns Imperial Parking Systems, for $5million.

Papers filed yesterday in Manhattan Supreme Court say that Lerner met the 43-year-old model at an art gallery in 2012 and wooed her for several months. They went on 'expensive' dates and he even took her to Aruba on a romantic trip.

The model told theÂ New York Post: 'We had fallen in love. It was a very serious relationship very quickly. The entire time, I had protected sex 
with him.

'It did cross my mind that maybe he 
should be tested, but on the other hand, I trusted him completely.'

It was in March 2012 that Lerner convinced her he didn't have any health issues and they had unprotected sex for the first time.

It was just a few days later she experienced a herpes outbreak, the papers allege.

When she went to the doctor, he told her she had recently been exposed to the herpes virus.

When she contacted Lerner and confronted him about it, he allegedly offered to pay $700 in medical expenses.

She ended their relationship soon after, her lawyers, Matthew Blit and Justin Clark, said.

Lerner's lawyers have yet to respond for comment.

It is not known if Lerner and his wife Alexandra are estranged.
