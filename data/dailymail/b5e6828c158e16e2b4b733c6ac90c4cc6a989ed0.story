Hunting for your charger and a free plug socket could soon be a thing of the past.

This is according to two electricians, who have designed the world’s first portable turbine phone charger that lets people charge their mobile phone using wind power alone.

In fact, the generator can power up any item that requires a USB charger for power.

Called Trinity, the device doesn’t quite mimic the shape of your usual wind turbine.

Instead, the product folds together into a 12-inch (30 cm) cylinder.

It then unfolds into a vertical turbine that be used to charge USB devices.

Inside the turbine is a battery that holds 15,000 mAh and a 15-watt generator.

To open the blades, you first need to pull out the legs and arrange them in a tripod or flat.

This will then enable the blades to catch the wind and spin, generating power.

Plugging a USB device into the base of the turbine will then charge it.

To close it up, the legs are pushed back in and the blades closed automatically.

To open the product you pull out the aluminium legs and arrange them either into a tripod or on a flat surface.

At the top of the legs is a turbine with three blades.

These capture the wind and spin, providing green energy for a generator that can supply to 15 watts of power.

There is also an internal battery that can store energy if you don’t need it right away.

The inventors claim when fully-charged the turbine can charge your phone four to six times.

Once
 the turbine is out of juice you can either charge it using the wind or 
plug it into a wall output, although obviously for clean energy purposes
 the former is preferred.

The
 company is currently running a Kickstarter project for funding, and 
they hope to be able to launch the portable turbine commercially by the 
start of next year.

The Trinity portable wind turbine unfolds to provide clean energy for your phone by harnessing the power of the wind. When spun the rotating blades charge the turbine, which can then be used to power mobile phones

Inside the turbine is a 15-watt generator that powers a 15,000 mAh battery. On the base of the turbine is one USB plug into which you can plug a USB device

The turbine can be unfolded wherever you are, so as long as you've got a breeze you'll be able to charge your phone. The legs can also be laid flat on surfaces
