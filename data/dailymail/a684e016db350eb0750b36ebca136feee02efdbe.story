A former Parent-Teacher Association president is being accused of filming child pornography in an elementary school.

The FBI arrested 37-year-old David Navarro on suspicion of child pornography charges Friday in North Mason County, Washington.

The feds learned about the video from authorities in Australia and Denmark who found a video depicting an 8-year-old girl engaging in sexual acts.

Because the video was shot on an iPhone they were able to track the video's origin to Belfair Elementary School.

The video was made in May and was in wide-circulation by June. The FBI were able to confirm that the videos were uploaded to the internet from Navarro's email.

At the time the video was taken, Navarro was PTA president and therefore had a set of the school's keys.

Authorities believe the girl in the video may be his step-daughter.

Navarro did have a prior record. He was arrested in San Diego in 2009 on allegations that he exposed himself and sexually assaulted three children, but those charges are dropped.

All volunteers at Belfair must undergo a background check, but they're not asked about arrests - only crimes 'for which you may have been convicted.'

The North Mason School District superintendent released a statement Wednesday, following Navarro's arrest. He said he found it 'alarming and disgusting' that the someone would film something like that in the school.

He confirmed that Navarro used to be the president of the school PTA and was a volunteer.

'While we cannot share a great deal of detail, nothing in the investigation indicates that the school should have been aware of or taken action in this case,' superintendent David Peterson said. 'The FBI informed us today that this is not something the school could reasonably have prevented.'

The arrest came as quite a surprise to fellow PTA member Gene Johnson.

He said he was shocked, and would never have suspected of Navarro engaging in such activities.

'He's a very exuberant guy, always wants to be involved, everything was about the kids,' Johnson told Q13 Fox.

Since his arrest, the FBI have confiscated 10 computers from his home, the iPhone they suspect he used to film the video and two pairs of undergarments.

They also discovered that Navarro's email was tied to an online service where it seems he posted at least 14 photos of two girls, including the 8-year-old in the initial video.

Federal agents are also looking into Navarro's social networking websites. His Twitter is still up and shows two pictures of women which he describes as 'creepshots' - taken when they aren't looking.

One of the pictures taken last October seems to be taken in the school library. It shows a female's underwear with the caption: 'School library is great.'

Navarro is currently being held at the Federal Detention Center at SeaTac, pending a hearing today.Â
