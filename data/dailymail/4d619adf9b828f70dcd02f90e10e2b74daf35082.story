'Oversight': Conservative Party co-chairman Baroness Warsi (pictured) has admitted failing to declare rental income on her London home in breach of House of Lords rules

Conservative co-chairman Baroness Warsi is facing calls for an investigation into her expenses over allegations that she claimed for overnight accommodation when staying at a friend's house rent-free.

Lady Warsi, a cabinet minister championed by David Cameron, insists that she made an 'appropriate payment' for the 'occasional nights' she stayed at a property occupied, but not owned by Tory official Naweed Khan.

Labour MP John Mann said he would be asking the Lords commissioner for standards to investigate.

Mr Khan, who later became Lady Warsi's special adviser, today backed her claim, releasing a statement saying she made a payment each time she stayed at the property.

However - according to reports in The Sunday Times and The Sunday Telegraph - the owner of the property in Acton, West London, denies that he received any income from either Lady Warsi or Mr Khan.

The 41-year-old Tory peer was at the time claiming Lords subsistence of £165.50 a night from the taxpayer.

Mr Mann said: 'If you are paying no rent where you are staying, you can't possibly be claiming subsistence for staying there.

'It all seems very murky. We need a full investigation into the matter.'

In a separate embarrassment for Lady Warsi, the most senior Muslim politician in Britain, has also admitted failing to declare rental income on a London flat in the Lords register of interests.

The two revelations are another blow for the Prime Minister who is already facing the possibility of temporarily losing Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt over the BSkyB debacle.

Mr Cameron and Lady Warsi have both spoken of the importance of a 'transparent government' and Mr Cameron's ambition to be 'one of the most transparent governments in the world.'

The smart Acton property at the centre of the claims is owned by Egyptian-born GP Dr Wafik Moustafa, a Conservative donor and former electoral candidate who is now engaged in a dispute with the party and Lady Warsi.

Mr Khan said that he stayed at the house belonging to Dr Moustafa between July 2007 and November 2008 while working in central London. He was living there rent free.

'In the early part of 2008, for a short period, Baroness Warsi stayed with me,' he said in the statement.

'I confirm she made a financial payment on each occasion, which compensated for the inconvenience caused and additional costs incurred by me as a result of her being there.'

Dr Wafik Moustafa, chairman of the Conservative Arab Network, said Lady Warsi had her own front door key and never offered to pay rent or bills and he didn't ask her for money

Dr Moustafa, chairman of the Conservative Arab Network, told the Sunday Times Lady Warsi had her own front door key and never offered to pay rent or bills and he didn't ask her for money.

He also said he used to give her occasional lifts into central London. He admitted to the paper he didn't ask for any money as he was hoping to further his political career.

Meanwhile, Lady Warsi said her failure to declare rental income on her £220,000 flat in Wembley, West London, was due to an 'oversight', adding that she had reported the letting of it in the Register of Ministers' Interests.

The arrangement had also been declared to the Cabinet Office and HM Revenue and Customs, she said.

The peer bought the property in 2007, when she was just 36 and the youngest peer in the upper chamber, but moved closer to Parliament when she became a minister in 2010, after which she began letting the Wembley flat.

Peers are required to declare sources of income of more than £500, although the annual rent on a London flat is likely to be many times greater than that.

In a statement last night, Lady Warsi said that she contracted to buy the flat in September 2007, but it was not due to be ready until the following year.

In the interim she stayed predominantly at two hotels but also, for 'occasional nights', at Dr Moustafa's Acton property occupied by Tory party adviser Mr Khan.

'The completion date for the property was slightly delayed, and not having made advanced bookings for these hotels, there was a period of around six weeks when I spent occasional nights at a flat in Acton, which was occupied by Naweed Khan, at the time a member of Conservative Campaign HQ staff,' she said.

Taking responsibility: The Cabinet Office minister did not disclose her income in the register of interests for members of the House of Lords (above), but did add it to the Register of Ministers' Interests

'For the nights that I stayed as a guest of Naweed Khan, I made an appropriate financial payment equivalent to what I was paying at the time in hotel costs.

'In March 2008, I moved into the flat in Wembley. As I was living in the property, it was therefore not registrable on the Register of Lords' Interests. Upon becoming a minister, however, my ownership of this property was fully disclosed to the Cabinet Office.

Labour MP John Mann said he would be asking the Lords commissioner for standards to investigate

'In June 2010, upon security advice, I moved to another address closer to the House of Lords and some months later began, with the prior approval of the Cabinet Office and the Leader of the House of Lords, to let out the Wembley property.

'Due to an oversight, for which I take full responsibility, the flat was not included on the Register of Lords' Interests when its value and the rent received came to exceed the thresholds for disclosure,' she said.

'When the discrepancy became apparent this week, I immediately informed the Registrar of Lords' Interests of its omission.

'I repeat, at all times my ownership of the flat and the fact that it was being let out was fully disclosed to Cabinet Office officials and HM Revenue and Customs, and was appropriately reported on the register of ministers' interests held by the Government.'

Shadow business minister Chuka Umunna has called for an inquiry.

He told BBC1's Sunday Politics: 'To rebuild trust and demonstrate this is being dealt with in a proper way there has to be a proper, independent investigation.

'So long as these stories endure, we are going to struggle to rebuild the trust and confidence we need there to be between Westminster and the people it exists there to serve. That is incredibly important.'

Lady Warsi is the daughter of immigrants from Pakistan. She failed to be elected in her home town of Dewsbury, West Yorkshire in 2005.

Despite that she was made a shadow minister two years later and her career took off.

Baroness Warsi's admission comes as it emerged Mr Hunt could temporarily step down from frontline politics after the Olympics after pressure over his handling of the bid by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation to take full control of BSkyB, it was reported in the Sunday Telegraph.

Yesterday, it was revealed how Mr Cameron ignored legal advice that allowing Mr Hunt to rule on the bid risked ‘prejudging the affair’ in the tycoon’s favour.

Mr Hunt is due to be questioned under oath at Lord Leveson’s inquiry into media standards this week.
