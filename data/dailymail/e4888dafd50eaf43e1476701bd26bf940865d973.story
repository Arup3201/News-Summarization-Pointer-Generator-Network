The role of Britain’s top mandarin in promoting the controversial £28billion takeover of the defence giant BAE by a European rival was last night under the spotlight.

Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood has helped persuade David Cameron to back the plans to join BAE Systems with EADS.

But he faces questions about his own role – and whether it constitutes a conflict of interest because he worked for three years at merchant bank Morgan Stanley, which stands to gain tens of millions from brokering the merger.

Sir Jeremy’s declaration of meetings with outside bodies reveals he has held four private sessions with BAE executives  – in May and July last year, and again in January and March – and one with EADS.

Since the election he has also twice met senior figures from Morgan Stanley, which is advising BAE – in October 2010 and October 2011 – for whom he worked between 2003 and 2007 as head of UK investment banking.

Senior government sources yesterday admitted that Mr Cameron is prepared to back the merger since it will give BAE access to the lucrative civil aviation sector.

This will happen if guarantees are given about protecting national security and reassuring the US that the plans would not compromise Pentagon secrets.

A senior Whitehall source said: ‘He is basically supportive and if he can be reassured on a number of points he will do all he can to talk to the Americans.

‘We are in a world where defence budgets are falling and by linking BAE with EADS you can create a better balance between civil and defence products.’

The Whitehall official admitted that Sir Jeremy has played an instrumental role in government talks with BAE. ‘He’s certainly been involved in the discussions,’ said the official.

‘When a company like BAE has close relations with the Government and is involved in discussions about mergers they would want to be plugged into the centre of government to hear its views.’

Tory MPs are in uproar at the plans, which will see Britain’s main defence contractor run by a German from a headquarters in France.

They believe it will leave the UK defence industry at the mercy of Europe, endanger British jobs and damage relations with the US.

Some 5000 Scots work for BAE Systems at its bases in Rosyth, Fife; Prestwick, Ayrshire; and Govan, Glasgow.

And last night Ben Wallace, who has 6,000 BAE workers in his Wyre and North Preston constituency, delivered a coded warning that Sir Jeremy’s enthusiasm for the plans is not shared by the Tory Party.

Mr Wallace did not attack Sir Jeremy by name. But he said: ‘The Government has to tread a fine line between arbitrating on the take-over and not being led down the garden path by those who have a vested interest.

If the recession has taught us anything it is: beware of bankers bearing gifts.’

He added: ‘There is great concern about handing our defence industrial base to a company controlled by the French and German states.

That cannot be good for our relations with the US or the demand from the MoD for more competition in defence procurement.’

MPs are also privately concerned that the Premier has signalled support for the deal, when the  Government also has to oversee the deal.

'It's no surprise the Cabinet Secretary often meets with Britain’s major employers. His role is no different from the role he plays on other major issues requiring high level ministerial involvement'

Department of Business sources say it is ‘very likely’ that Business Secretary Vince Cable will have to refer it to the Office of Fair Trading and potentially to the Competition Commission as well.

Mr Cable has refused to state his views, since he will be expected to behave in a quasi-judicial manner and avoid the pitfalls that befell the Government’s handling of the Murdoch empire’s bid for BSkyB.

One MP opposed to the deal said: ‘I’m not sure why No 10 are busy telling people Cameron supports the bid when the Government has to act impartially.’

A spokesman for Sir Jeremy said: ‘It's no surprise the Cabinet Secretary often meets with Britain’s major employers.

'His role is no different from the role he plays on other major issues requiring high level ministerial involvement.’

Sources close to Sir Jeremy say he left Morgan Stanley more than five years ago and that it would be ‘absurd’ to suggest he would profit in any way from the deal.
