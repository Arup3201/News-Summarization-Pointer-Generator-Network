The man suspected of fatally slashing a 25-year-old youth soccer coach in one of New York City's busiest neighborhoods has fled to Mexico, after bogus reports that police had a suspect in custody.

The suspect has been identified by investigators as Orlando Orea or Orlando Gutierrez, who fled on an Aero Mexico flight bound for Mexico City on Tuesday, two days after the murder.

He is accused of stabbing Michael Jones six times and savagely hacking off one of his ears early Sunday morning before leaving him to bleed to death.

Devoted: Mike Jones, 25, called his girlfriend Bryeanna Murphy, 23, several times the night he was killed

It had previously been mistakenly reported that a 'person of interest' in the case was in police custody.

On the night he was killed, Mr Jones had been out with his girlfriend, Bryeanna Murphy, 23, from Mamaroneck, NY, whose father described to MailOnline her devastation at her boyfriend's death.

The beloved youth soccer coach from Liverpool, England, spoke with his girlfriend Murphy, 23, on the phone just minutes before he was attacked. 

Tim Murphy told MailOnline: 'She's devastated. She can't believe it has happened.'

Long term: Miss Murphy had been dating Mr Jones for about six months

He described Mr Jones, who had been dating his daughter for six months, as 'a real gentleman.' 

He added: ' He was a lovely guy. Good mannered, good fun, just the kind of guy you'd want your daughter to go out with.'

Mr Murphy said that his daughter last heard from Mr Jones at midnight. She was home by 2am and went to sleep. 

'She didn't know anything was wrong,' he said.

On Sunday morning, police contacted a mutual friend of the couple, who had been one of the last dialled numbers on Mr Jones' phone. The friend was told to come to a police station and she was informed about the tragedy. She then contacted Miss Murphy. 

Mr Murphy said that the family has been in email contact with Mr Jones' relatives back in England. 

He said: 'We expressed to them our sincere condolences. We wanted to let them know we are thinking of them,' he said. 

The family is planning to go to a memorial service to be held on Wednesday in White Plains. Some members of Mr Jones's family, who are being flown over by the Red Bulls, are expected to attend.

Mr Murphy added: 'I hope they catch this guy and get him off the streets.' 

After getting the suspect's name, the
NYPD tried to put the suspect on a no-fly list on Tuesday afternoon, but it 
was too late to stop him.

The New York Post reported that the suspect was identified by a bartender near the scene of the murder, who described Orea as a regular.

The revelation came as it emerged 
that Mr Jones may have been brutally stabbed to death in Greenwich Village in a 
tragic case of mistaken identity.

Detectives
are looking into a fight earlier in the evening that Mr Jones' 
suspected killer had over a woman he met in a bar earlier that night, 
the Post reported.

Beloved: Mr Jones was well-liked by the young players he mentored as a coach in the Red Bulls' Westchester youth league

Police believe Mr Jones had nothing 
to do with the woman or the fight, but was instead mistaken for the 
murder suspect's nightclub adversary.

Officers have ruled out robbery, since Mr Jones' wallet and iPhone were still with him.

Surveillance video shows Mr Jones next to his pony-tailed killer about 4.15am on Sunday on West 14th Street, according to the Post.

The two men appear to exchange words 
and begin to argue. The suspect suddenly pushes Mr Jones against a 
building and pulls out a knife.

A medical examiner ruled that Mr Jones died of stab wound to his chest and stomach, including a puncture in his heart.

Mr Jones and his girlfriend spent out together on Saturday night in the East Village visiting a friend's apartment.

He left Miss Murphy about 11.30pm to hit the town at several upscale nightclubs with other friends.

Despite
the boy's' night out, Mr Jones dutifully called his girlfriend several 
times throughout the evening - including just before he was killed.

'He
coached two of my three sons and was just a great guy. He cared about 
what he did, and was very dedicated,' Mark Fischer, who oversees 
referees in the Westchester league, told the Post. 'The kids loved him.'

Mr
Jones' father Perry, who lives with his wife Carol just north over 
Liverpool, told the BBC his son loved living in the United States and 
was hoping to move to New York City permanently.

'He
loved New York and he loved the lifestyle and he was working and hoping
to get a visa so he could stay there full time,' the elder Mr Jones 
said.

He said he and his wife received a Facebook message from one of his son's friends on Sunday telling him to call the NYPD.

When the couple phoned, they found out their promising young son had been brutally murdered.

Mr Jones' body was found at 4:25am, his ear lying a few feet away.

Officers
covered the ear with a plastic cup to hide it from passersby and rushed
the man to Bellevue where he was pronounced dead on arrival.

'It was a frenzy. The guy was chopped multiple times,' a police source told the Post. 'He cut the guy's ear off. It doesn't get any more personal than that.'

In a statement released on Sunday, 
the Red Bulls said: 'We are aware of this tragedy and on behalf of the 
entire organization, want to send our most heartfelt condolences to 
Michael’s family, friends and loved ones.

'He
was a tremendous individual, a fantastic coach who loved soccer and a 
terrific friend for many of us. This is truly a sad day for our soccer 
community and we will do our utmost to help authorities in their 
investigation of this case. Our thoughts and prayers are with Michael's 
family at this time.'

Witness said that Jones was so mutilated that they believed it was a prank.

'We thought it was a Halloween joke or something because his phone was 
there, so maybe if we tried to get his phone that he’ll pop up or 
something,' a witness told CBS News York.

Another disturbed witness said: 'I never, ever, ever seen nothing like this. Ever.'
