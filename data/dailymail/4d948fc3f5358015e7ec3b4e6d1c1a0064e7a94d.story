The Sikh community has pressured Walmart into pulling a turban-themed costume from its website calling it ‘insulting’ and tells the retailer to use more 'common sense' in future.

The Sikh Coalition said in a letter on Friday that the costume is offensive to 9/11 victims and will cause ‘negative stereotypes about turbans and beards that have led to violence and discrimination against Sikhs and other minorities’.

The Sikh Coalition offered an image of the original costume and the al-Qaeda leader, Osama Bin Laden, as part of their letter.

Similarity: The Sikh community says the Halloween costume, left, bears too much resemblance to the al Qaeda terrorist Osama Bin Laden, right

'We apologise': Walmart, who called the costume the 'Turban Beard Adult Halloween Instant Costume', pulled the product from their website

The letter: On Friday the Sikh Coalition asked Walmart to discontinue the sale of the costume

The group also sent letters to retailers such as Amazon.com, which listed the costume under the banner ‘Fun World Adult Men’s Osama Bin Laden Middle East Costume Turban + Beard’.

Walmart described it as ‘Turban Beard Adult Halloween Instant Costume’.

The costume appears to be manufactured by Fun World Costumes, and is for sale on the sites of retailers such as Sears and Rite Aid, among others.

Rajdeep Singh, Director of Law and Policy at The Sikh Coalition, told The Huffington Post he doubts the costume would make people who had lost loved ones in the 9/11 attacks comfortable.

A Walmart spokesperson said they ‘disabled this item for purchase and are in the process of immediately removing it from our site’, according to the Post.

‘We sincerely apologise to any customers who may have been offended by this costume.’

Spiritual: Sikhs wear turbans due to their religious beliefs. It represents honour, self-respect, courage, spirituality and piety

Ignorance: About 70 per cent of Americans misidentify turban-wearing Sikhs (pictured) as Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists or members of the Shinto faith

Wrong culture: The Sikhs are often mistaken for being Arab because of their turban. However, Arabs do not wear turbans, they wear a Keffiyeh, such as this man from Palestine

Humiliation: Jagjeet Singh declined to take off his turban after Judge Aubrey Rimes of Mississippi Pike County Justice Court told him to 'remove that rag'

Attack: Prabhjot Singh, an professor at Columbia University, was brutally attacked and called 'terrorist' and 'Osama' in an incident that required him to get jaw surgery

Sikh Americans face an extremely high degree of ignorance surrounding their religious practices and beliefs.

According
to a recent survey by Stanford University  about 70 per cent of 
Americans misidentify turban-wearing Sikhs as Muslims, Hindus, 
Buddhists or members of the Shinto faith.

The
complaint to the retailers comes in the wake of a brutal hate crime last week 
against a respected member of the American Sikh community, Dr. Prabhjot 
Singh, a professor at Columbia University.

His attackers shouted ‘terrorist’ and ‘Osama’ and pulled at his beard and turban in an attack that required him to get jaw surgery.

And earlier this year, Jagjeet Singh, a long-haul truck driver, was told to take off his turban in court after being arrested by police officers who called him a 'terrorist'.

In court Judge Aubrey Rimes of Mississippi Pike County Justice Court said ‘remove that rag’.

Singh refused, saying that to remove his turban would be sacrilegious and shameful.

The turban is an important part of the religious identity for most Sikhs.

It is an article of faith that represents honour, self-respect, courage, spirituality and piety.

The men also wear the turban partly to cover their long hair, which their religion strictly forbids them to cut.
