With a bitter legal row escalating and his carefully crafted public image hanging by a thread, X Factor boss Simon Cowell insists he is ‘smitten and very much in love’ with the New York socialite carrying  his child and has vowed: ‘I’ll do the right thing.’

The rattled reality TV star faced a barrage of abuse this week from close friend Andrew Silverman, who accused him of shattering a perfect family by fathering a child with his glamorous wife Lauren.

But The Mail on Sunday can reveal that Cowell, 53, has promised to support his lover ‘emotionally and financially’ and insists he is committed to forging a long-term relationship with the brunette.

It is understood his support will include bankrolling her costs after her estranged husband launched a divorce case against her in which he labelled her ‘inhuman’.

A close friend of Cowell’s, speaking with his permission, has told how the star has promised to stand by Mrs Silverman, who is said to be desperate for marriage.

The confidante said: ‘Simon and Lauren are smitten with each other – they’re looking forward to the baby. They started as friends, but their friendship became stronger and they fell in love.

'I have never seen Simon so excited by something that isn’t related to his work. Becoming a father seems to have put things in perspective for him.’

But the star faces accusations that his 
apparent transformation to family man is a cynical stunt to protect his 
image in America.

After the news of the pregnancy broke, it was suggested that Cowell would merely look after the baby financially and put a roof over Mrs Silverman’s head.

The sudden turnaround from this stance to saying he will play an active role as a parent comes amid fears the scandal could destroy his popularity, particularly in America where he is the face of family television.

He launched a third series of the X Factor USA for Fox TV last week.   

His senior advisers fear the scandal could be damaging in America’s conservative and religious heartland. Insiders claim Fox executives will be watching the saga unfold ‘very closely’ fearing potential damage to their brand. Pepsi, which sponsors the X Factor, could also argue he has brought its brand into disrepute.

Cowell’s deals with Fox TV have made him the highest-earning personality on U.S. television.

He makes approximately £60 million a year from The X Factor in salary and intellectual property rights, according to business magazine Forbes.

One source said: ‘You have got to be aware that the only thing that matters to Simon is Simon’s reputation.

‘Yes, he wants to do the right thing. Yes, he wants to earn money. Yes, he wants to honour his commitments. But ultimately he wants to protect his reputation – and mostly his reputation in the US.’

Ever since Mrs Silverman told her husband about the baby, on July 10, a vicious propaganda war has been played out behind the scenes.

However, last night a close friend of the new couple, New York fashion designer Rachel Roy, insisted the romance was real.

Ms Roy, who joined them on the Slipstream super-yacht where they first met, said: ‘What I know for sure is that when they are together they are the happiest I have ever seen them.’

Rachel, who took the now infamous photograph of Cowell and Mrs Silverman cuddling on board the boat, added: ‘This is not a case of opposites attract. Simon and Lauren are similar in so many ways, they have many shared interests and values.

They laugh at the same things, love the same foods, music and simply enjoy each other’s company in a way that best friends do.’

Cowell’s close friend added: ‘He’s  told Lauren and her family that he will do everything he can to support them all while she and Andrew work out their divorce matters.

Simon respects what she thinks.’ The Mail on Sunday understands the X Factor star is planning a yacht getaway with Mrs Silverman after completing his latest TV commitments.

Mr and Mrs Silverman had a £2 million pre-nuptial agreement.

The businessman is understood to be determined to hold on to his cash, claiming that his wife will be well provided for by Cowell.

The Mail on Sunday has also learned that the agreement included a ‘no-cheat’ clause, which Mr Silverman is likely to attempt to use.

The source said: ‘If the divorce court agrees with Andrew that Simon and Lauren had an adulterous affair, Andrew won’t have to pay any alimony beyond what was set out in the pre-nup’. 

The businessman is also bidding for full custody of their seven-year-old son, Adam, and plans to accuse his wife of being a poor parent.

But a friend of Mrs Silverman insisted yesterday that the New York housewife is a fantastic mother, and claimed Cowell was not the cause of the marriage split.

Mrs Silverman is ‘outraged’ by her husband’s anger and claims he was seeing other women, it was claimed last night.

Website TMZ cited unnamed sources close to her who claimed: ‘She hooked up with Simon partly because Andrew was cavorting around the world and partying with girls on various continents. It was a mutual understanding.’

She is also vowing to fight her husband’s claim for custody. TMZ said: ‘Andrew wants full custody but Lauren is saying no way in hell will he get that. Lauren says she wants prime custody and will fight tooth and nail to get it.’ 

Cowell’s friend added: ‘She was still technically married – but the truth is her marriage was irreparably damaged when she and Simon became an item. She’s totally in love and almost obsessed. She really wants to marry him, but who knows if she will get him down the aisle.

‘Her and Andrew’s marriage was never made in heaven and they argued a lot right from the start.’

Andrew’s parents Eleanora and Allen are understood to have frowned on their future daughter-in-law from the beginning – and even boycotted the couple’s 2003 wedding at New York’s St Regis hotel because they considered her a ‘gold-digger’.

Yesterday, Mr Silverman was with his estranged wife at their £2.5 million home in Bridgehampton, New York. The source added: ‘He went there for the sake of his son. 

‘He wants to try and keep things as normal as possible for Adam.’

Andrew Silverman owns a casino in Panama where locals say prostitution is rife

The cuckolded husband of the socialite carrying Simon Cowell’s baby owns a casino in Panama where locals say prostitution is rife.

Andrew Silverman is a strait-laced property developer in New York, writes Matt Sandy, but he also owns a 300-bedroom hotel and casino in Panama City, said to be the largest in Central America, that has become a hub for sex workers.

Andrew and his brother Alexander bought the Veneto Hotel and Casino in a £39million deal in 2007through their company, Silver Entertainment.

The decision to invest in Panama City, where prostitution is legal, is curious, given its reputation as a low-rent Las Vegas-style ‘Sin City’.

Their ambition was to turn the hotel, which has 42 casino tables, into a high-end property they couldthen sell to a major hotel chain for a profit.

In the meantime the casino teems with prostitutes.

Hotel workers, tourists and the prostitutes themselves all confirmed to The Mail on Sunday that the Veneto has a more lenient policy on soliciting than some other high-end hotels in Panama City.

When this newspaper visited the 18-storey complex on Friday evening, at least 30 prostitutes were openly soliciting for business on the casino floor, while tourist police and security guards stood by and watched.

There is no suggestion that the hotel is involved directly in prostitution, or that the Silvermans endorse it.
