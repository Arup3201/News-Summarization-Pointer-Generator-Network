Affair: Married police officer David McCann reportedly had sex with his mistress 36 times while on duty

A veteran police officer has been suspended after reportedly having sex with his 'booty call' mistress 36 times while he was on duty.

Melissa Kingfield claimed she had regular liaisons with married David McCann as his 'dinner break booty call' and even recorded all their trysts in a personal journal.

McCann, 42, a veteran officer with Sunrise Police Department, Broward, Florida, has since been suspended for 200 hours after Kingfield, 30, gave her detailed sex spreadsheet to police.

Her diary reveals how the pair shared 'nooner sex' (sex at midday), as well as 'quality time/sex' while McCann was on duty.

The pair are said to have met in April 2009, according to an investigator's report, but their romance ended last summer.

According
to the Sun Sentinel, Lt William Glennon, an Internal Affairs 
investigator, said McCann 'used his position as a police officer ... to 
calculatingly and stealthily have a consensual affair with Melissa 
Kingfield while on duty.'

In a statement made last summer, Kingfield is said to have told Glennon: 'I was dinner break booty call.'

She told the Sun Sentinel: ''I felt 
like I was blinded by my love for him and I trusted all his excuses. I 
felt like I was really taken advantage of.

'I felt conned, manipulated, used. And for what purpose, I may never know.'

McCann and Kingfield had a two-year affair lasting from May 2009 until June last year, according to her sex spreadsheet.

The pair are said to have met at a crime watch meeting in April 2009, where McCann told Kingfield he was having marital problems.

Just days after they met, McCann is said to have told Kingfield she was 'perfect and everything he had been searching for his whole life'.

The last entry in her journal reads: 'Hugging â€” No sex still on a break/He says next time we're together we'll have a baby.'

The officer, who has worked for Sunrise Police for 13 years, has since insisted he did not have sex with Kingfield while he was working.

McCann has since said he 'totally cut off' Kingfield by changing his phone number and blocking her emails.

Investigator Mr Glennon cross-referenced her diary against McCann's time card to confirm whether the liaisons happened while he was on duty.

However, her account has been dismissed byUnion attorney Robert Buschel as the work of a 'scorned woman intent on revenge.'

Buschel told the Sun Sentinel: 'She is a scorned woman and this is a campaign to punish him.

'What kind of woman keeps track of her sexual activities and then turns it in to get a guy in trouble?'

Kingfield revealed the affair ended up being a 'nightmare' for her, adding that since their relationship finished 'just the sight of a police car makes me sick and scared'.
