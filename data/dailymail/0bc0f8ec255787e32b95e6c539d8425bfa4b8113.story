Taking action: Police tried to intervene over the latest cover of Private Eye featured Rebekah Brooks on the eve of her hacking trial

Scotland Yard was today accused of taking a 'blasé' attitude to press freedom after its officers warned against the sale of Private Eye because it called Rebekah Brooks a 'witch' on the eve of her phone hacking trial.

A vendor was approached near the Old Bailey and asked to 'consider' removing the magazine's latest edition from his stand because it could prejudice legal proceedings.

The 'Halloween special' cover shows Ms Brooks, 45, pictured outside the High Court, above the caption 'Horror witch costume withdrawn from shops' and surrounded by carved pumpkins. 

The former News International chief 
executive is currently facing trial along with seven other defendants 
including ex-Number 10 spin doctor Andy Coulson.

Last night the Attorney General confirmed
the cover was not in contempt of court, and the police's behaviour branded 
'worrying' by press freedom supporters.

Yesterday a jury was sworn in to try the case, which may take as long as six months, and the judge took the unprecedented step of showing them the cover and telling them to dismiss it. 

'Unfortunately Private Eye has seen fit today to put out their November edition. You will undoubtedly see it on the newstands, so I can show it to you,' Mr Justice Saunders said.

'It bears a picture of Rebekah Brooks on the cover. It's meant to be satire. You ignore it. It has no serious input and it is not relevant to your considerations.

'It is one of those things that you will have to ignore - a joke which in the circumstances of today is a joke in especially bad taste.'

Case: The police acted fearing that the trial of Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson, both pictured outside court today, could be put in jeopardy. The Attorney General said it would not.

Despite Justice Saunders' actions, the Attorney General quickly decided Private Eye posed no problems to the trial.

Presiding judge: Mr Justice Saunders showed the magazine to the jury and called the cover 'a joke in especially bad taste'

His spokesman said: 'The front cover of the current edition of Private Eye has been 
brought to the attention of the Attorney General, but it has been 
decided that proceedings for a potential contempt of court are not 
required in this case.'

The man asked to take down the cover, Tony McCarthy, has described his shock after he was approached by the authorities twice yesterday and the Met has confirmed that they tried to take action at two stalls near the Old Bailey.

'Metropolitan Police Service officers, in conjunction with other parties within the trial, made enquiries with a vendor about the latest Private Eye publication to assist the court. They advised the vendor that the publication may be in contempt of court,' a spokesman said.

Press freedom campaigners have heavily criticised the action.

Padraig Reidy, from the Index on Censorship told the Daily Telegraph: 'It is an example of a very blasé attitude towards the free press on the part of these individual policemen. That is worrying.

'The vendor should be congratulated for demanding to see a court order, which didn’t appear.'

Today the hacking trial is due to start.

Brooks and Coulson allegedly conspired with former News of the World head of news Ian Edmondson, 44, the tabloid’s ex-managing editor Stuart Kuttner, 73, and others to illegally access voicemails between October 2000 and August 2006.

Brooks is also charged with conspiring with others to commit misconduct in public office linked to alleged inappropriate payments to public officials.

She also faces allegations of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice – one with former personal assistant Cheryl Carter, 49 – over the alleged removal of material from News International.

Brooks, her husband Charlie Brooks and former head of security at News International Mark Hanna are also accused of conspiring together to pervert the course of justice.

Coulson, David Cameron’s former spin doctor, is also charged with conspiring with the News of the World’s former royal editor, Clive Goodman, 56, to commit misconduct in public office.

They all deny the charges.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
