Stationery giant Officeworks is recalling a range of USB chargers which could overheat and melt when used.

About 3,400 affected chargers were sold at Officeworks stores and its website between July 19, 2013 to August 2, 2014.

The organisation has confirmed with the New South Wales Fair Trading office they were having the chargers tested and assessed.

Officeworks has issued a recall of a USB charger which may melt when used by consumers. About 3,400 of them were sold nationwide

NSW Fair Trading Minister Matthew Mason-Cox urged consumers to check their chargers.

The product model number for the affected chargers is MS10071223.

'This is a voluntary recall undertaken by Officeworks following a recent incident where a USB charging device overheated, causing the casing to melt,' Mr Mason-Cox said in a statement.

'Consumers who have purchased these devices are urged to stop using them immediately and return the goods to Officeworks for a full refund.

'If consumers are unsure, they should still contact Officeworks for advice.'

It comes two months after the death of Sydney nurse Sheryl Aldeguer who died from being electrocuted by a faulty charger while on the phone

The 28-year-old left behind two children and her husband, Luigi (both pictured). She had just moved to the Philippines to start a new job at Gosford Hospital

The Officeworks free call number is 1300 633 423.

This latest incident comes less than two months after the death of Sydney nurse Sheryl Aldeguer who is believed to have died while taking on her phone which was plugged into a faulty charger.

The charger, which did not meet Australian safety regulations, had inadequate shielding causing 240 volts to 'arc' and pass from the charger through the phone into her body.

Mrs Aldeguer - who left behind two children and husband, Luigi - was found dead in her Gosford home and was due to start work at the local hospital.

It is believed she died instantly and her body, which had burns to the chest and ears, was found the following day by friends and her landlord.
