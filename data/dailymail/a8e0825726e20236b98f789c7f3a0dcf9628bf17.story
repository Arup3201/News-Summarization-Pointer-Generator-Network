A law student has called on Facebook's one billion users worldwide to join a class action fight against the social network over privacy rights.

Austrian campaigner Max Schrems is claiming damages of €500 (£397) per supporter for alleged data protection violations.

He has billed it as a ‘David and Goliath lawsuit’ and it could ultimately be the largest class and privacy action ever taken in Europe.

Austrian campaigner Max Schrems is claiming damages of €500 (£397) per supporter for alleged data protection violations, billed as a ‘David and Goliath lawsuit’

‘We are only claiming a small amount, as our primary objective is to ensure correct data protection,’ Mr Schrems said.

The lawsuit is being taken in the Commercial Court in Vienna against the Irish subsidiary of the New York-listed web giant. 

Therefore, it only applies to users who have a contract with Facebook Ireland. 

This means its not available to users in the US and Canada.

Angered users can sign up using an app on fbclaim.com.

The app asks users to sign in using their Facebook account to verify their identity.

They will also need to upload a scan or image of their passport or driving licence.

Supporters have been assured there are no cost risks and all the data is securely encrypted.

‘However, if many thousands of people participate we would reach an amount that will have a serious impact on Facebook.’

The lawsuit is being taken in the Commercial Court in Vienna against the Irish subsidiary of the New York-listed web giant.

Mr Schrems is moving his Europe-V-Facebook.org campaign from complaints to the Data Protection Commission in Ireland, to the courts in his homeland, as European consumer law allows complainants to take legal action where they live.

The privacy activist has more than 20 complaints of alleged data breaches involving Facebook filed with the Irish data watchdog already.

The class action in Vienna claims Facebook Ireland is in breach of European law on users' data, and that it violates rights by tracking internet use on external sites including the use of ‘Like’ buttons.

It also attacks Facebook's analysis of users through what it calls ‘big data’ systems.

Mr Schrems additionally criticised the company for allegedly supporting the US Prism surveillance programme - the National Security Agency's secret monitoring and data mining exposed by whistleblower Edward Snowden.

An earlier landmark battle, launched in Ireland to find out what Facebook tells US spy chiefs, was referred to the European Court of Justice by a judge in Dublin last month.

Facebook declined to comment. 

Mr Schrems said he is the only claimant under the Austrian legal system, but the action is being financed entirely by Roland ProzessFinanz AG.

If successful, Roland will receive 20 per cent of the damages for putting up the funding.

The class action is open to all registered adult Facebook users outside the US and Canada.

Mr Schrems added: ‘We love to complain constantly about data protection problems in Europe, now it's also time for us to enforce our fundamental rights.

‘In the beginning we made great progress in Ireland. As a result of our complaints, Facebook had to delete data and deactivate its facial recognition all over the world.’
