 An original sketch of Winnie the Pooh playing Poohsticks with his friends Piglet and Christopher Robin is set to sell for more than £100,000 when it goes under the hammer next month.

The illustration by EH Shepard was first published in 1928, and is one of the most famous images of AA Milne's beloved bear. 

It will be sold by Sotheby’s in London next month after being housed in a private collection for more than 40 years.

Shepard’s ink drawing featured in Milne's book The House At Pooh Corner, for Chapter 6, entitled 'In which Pooh invents a new game and Eeyore joins in'.

It accompanies the closing scene of the chapter where the three characters stand on the Poohsticks bridge, dropping their sticks into the water and watching them emerge on the other side of the crossing, as the mood changes from the high excitement of their new game to a more wistful atmosphere.

'For a long time they looked at the river beneath them, saying nothing, and the river said nothing too, for it felt very quiet and peaceful on this summer afternoon,' Milne wrote.

Inspiration: Shephard’s ink drawing featured in the AA Milne book The House At Pooh Corner, and the bridge in the image was based on Posingford Bridge in East Sussex (right)

Much-loved: The bridge was carefully restored and reopened by Christopher Milne (pictured) - the author’s son who inspired the character of Christopher Robin - in May 1979, before it was rebuilt in 1999

Select and mark a stick found on the ground.

Stand upstream and hold sticks out at arm's length.

At an agreed signal drop the sticks. Anyone caught throwing theirs will be disqualified.

Move to the other side of the bridge. The owner of the first stick to emerge wins.

NB: As Rabbit says, they will 'take longer than you think'.

The drawing will feature in Sotheby’s sale of English literature, history, children’s books and illustrations on December 9, alongside other illustrations by Shephard, and is estimated to sell for between £100,00 and £150,000.

'The illustration can be counted among the most familiar, and most loved, cultural references in English literature,' said a spokesman from the auction house.

The original wooden crossing on which the illustration is based, Posingford Bridge, at Hartfield Farm, East Sussex, had fallen into disrepair by the 1970s.

However, it was carefully restored and reopened by Christopher Milne - the author’s son who inspired the character of Christopher Robin - in May 1979 at a ceremony where it was called 'as important a bridge as any in the world'. 

It was completely rebuilt in 1999 after being worn down by the number of visitors wanting to follow in Pooh's footsteps. Visitors are encouraged to bring their own sticks with them to avoid damage being done to the surrounding trees.

Born in December, 1879, Ernest Howard Shepard was working as a cartoonist at the magazine Punch, when he was recommended to Milne by a colleague in 1923.

Milne had inititally thought Shepard's style was not what he wanted, but used him to illustrate his book of poems When We Were Very Young before insisting the cartoonist illustrated more of his work.

Milne recognised the contribution the illustrator had made to his books' success and arranged for him to receive a cut of the royalties, but Shepard eventually grew to resent 'that silly old bear' and felt his Pooh drawings overshadowed the rest of his work.  

Londoner Shepard was made an OBE in 1972 in recognition of his illustrations and died on March 24, 1976, aged 96. He also illustrated the characters for Kenneth Grahame's The Wind In The Willows.

Milne died aged 74 in January 1956, and his son aged 75 in April 1996.
