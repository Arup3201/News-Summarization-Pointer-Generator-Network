A dog needed life-saving treatment after she chewed the cap off a bottle of Baileys and drank the lot.

Six-year-old German Shepherd cross Molly was found crumpled in a heap by her owners at their home in Folkestone, Kent, after she guzzled a litre of the creamy liqueur.

The owners, who asked not to be named, said they had taken Molly on her morning walk before leaving her in the house for 'a short period of time'.

When they returned they found Molly barely conscious and suffering fits as she struggled to breathe.

At the time, Molly's owners had no idea what was wrong and rushed her to the vet, where she was put under general anaesthetic to stop any further seizures.

It was only when Molly's owners returned home they found a entire one-litre bottle of Baileys - which has an ABV of 17 per cent - empty in the living room.

Molly had chewed the cap of the bottle, which was full and had not previously been opened, and proceeded to glug every last drop.

Vet Jane Lewis, who helped save Molly's life at Manor Vets in Folkestone, said the dog was lucky to be alive after being treated for alcohol poisoning.

She said Molly was taken to a specialist unit for overnight care last Monday, the day she was admitted, and started to make a full recovery by the end of last week.

She said: 'She is very lucky to have made a full recovery from her ordeal.

'Alcohol is not just toxic to humans but pets as well and sweet tasting drinks such as Baileys can be impossible to resist.

'As the festive season approaches we hope this will act as a warning to all pet owners to ensure your Christmas spirits are kept out of reach for children and animals alike.

'The next time we see alcohol toxicity we may not see such a happy ending.'
