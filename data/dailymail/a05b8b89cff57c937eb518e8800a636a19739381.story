When this cunning fox spotted a vole scurrying along in the snow, it set itself up to pounce.

But despite taking aim, jumping high into the air and diving in head first, it found that its prey was just too quick - and ended up well and truly wedged in the ground.

Photographer Steve Hinch, 44, took the pictures on the snowy plains of Yellowstone National Park in the United States. He said: 'I enjoyed watching the fox leap into the snow, hunting in this fashion is a great spectacle to see.'

Photographer Steve Hinch, 44, took the pictures on the snowy plains of Yellowstone National Park in the United States. He said he could see the fox's  ears twitching back and forth trying to pinpoint the location of the vole

Once the fox had pinpointed its prey, it leapt up and dropped down face first into the snow attempting to pin the rodent with its nose or paws

Captured jumping high into the air with eyes fixed on the prize, the bushy tailed fox is seen leaping for his prey and then diving head first into the frozen surface.

With its tail pointed towards the sky, the striking young fox is buried beneath the sheet of white. However, instead of emerging with a tasty meal in its muzzle, the fox came up empty handed and a little red faced. The animal then carried on its journey to find food.

Steve said: 'The fox will listen for the sound of its prey as it moves in tunnels under the snow.

'As I was watching and photographing the fox I could see its ears twitching back and forth trying to pinpoint the location of the rodent.

'Once it had pinpointed its prey, the fox leapt up high and dropped down face first into the snow attempting to pin the rodent with its nose or paws.

'Sadly on this occasion, the fox missed its meal.'
