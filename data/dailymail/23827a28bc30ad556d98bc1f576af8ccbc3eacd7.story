Just one in ten of those living in Channel 4's latest Benefits Street are on long-term benefits while crime rates in the area are lower than the national average, statistics have revealed.

Television crews started filming in Kingston Road, Stockton, last week in the follow up to the controversial first series shot in Birmingham.

But according to figures broken down by household on the road in 2011, only eight per cent were classed as long-term unemployed.

And police figures show that crime in the area is lower than the national average with 52 crimes per 1,000 people reported in the Stockton borough.

This is the lowest rate in the Tees Valley region, the Sunday Times reports.

Producers are already being accused of filming residents who have no desire to be in the show. A number of residents living in the area have hit out at the choice of location with one insisting it 'paints a really bad picture on the area'.

The controversial first series made stars of James Turner Street in Birmingham - including White Dee, who reportedly accepted £100,000 to appear on Big Brother.

However, the show received almost 2,000 complaints by viewers who said the show was 'exploiting people' for the 'sake of entertainment' and branded 'poverty porn'. 

It has been reported that an unemployed grandmother Dot Taylor is being lined up to be the next star of the show - and is set to be joined by a neighbour with a horse in the front garden of his terraced house.

The 48-year-old grandmother, who has given up trying to find a job after 20 years out of work, has spoken about life on the deprived Stockton-on-Tees estate taking part in the second series of the Channel 4 show. 

Dot - who is 4ft 11ins - wants to be the new matriarch of the TV series and hopes it could bring her fame and fortune.

But statistics from the 2011 census, published in the Sunday Times, show that just over a third of residents in Kingston Road were in full time or part-time employment or were self employed.

Just 16 per cent were unemployed and 16 per cent were disabled or long-term sick, the newspaper reports. 

In Stockton this week, MPs  were disappointed their town had been chosen, despite the production company being told they were not welcome.

Labour MP for Stockton North, Alex Cunningham hopes to talk residents  into pulling out of appearing on the show

Labour MP for Stockton North, Alex Cunningham hopes to talk people into pulling out of appearing on the show.

He said: 'There is no doubt this is about exploiting vulnerable people in order to make money.'

'I know they will say it is about trying to give people a voice, but all they will do is expose them to the full glare of the national media.'

James Wharton, Tory MP for Stockton South, said: 'I don't want them here making a programme which will show people in the worst possible light and potentially do such huge damage.

'For the producers it's easy ratings for a few weeks, but the damage they do can last much longer."

Stockton Council leader Bob Cook was 'deeply disappointed' the Benefits Street cameras were in the town.

'No doubt this programme won't highlight the excellent work that is on-going to make our town an even better place to live and work,' he said.

Residents have given a mixed reaction to the filming.

Amanda Bedford, 37, a cashier living on Temple Court close to the filming location, said: 'On the last series they made everyone look really bad.

'My daughter was filmed in the garden at her friends house.

'I was never asked about this before hand and I hope they won't use the footage, or at least black out her face.

'They should have got my permission first, and I would have said no.

'The majority of people here are good , hard working people, and I cant believe that people have decided to do it.

Another resident, who did not to be named, said: 'I don't think it is right at all. I definitely don't want to get involved with it.

'I cant quite see why people would want to be a part of it if they have seen the first series. It paints a really bad picture on the area.' 

 A Channel 4 spokesperson told MailOnline: 'Benefits Street does not only feature residents who are long term unemployed. 

'Some participants are receiving other kinds of welfare allowance while others are in full-time employment - though the majority of households on the street do have someone claiming benefits. 

'The series is about streets that have a real sense of community and residents who are getting on with their lives despite the challenges they may face.'

Kieran Smith, the creative director at Love Productions, told the Sunday Times: 'We've come here with good intentions... I want to show the authentic experience of living on Kingston Road. 

'We are not focusing purely on people claiming people claiming benefits.'
