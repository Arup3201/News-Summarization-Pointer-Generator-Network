This horrifying video shows motorway lampposts shaking violently in a snowstorm as Britain was hit by strong winds and freezing temperatures.

The clip posted yesterday by motorist Bob Hill on Facebook has been viewed more than a million times, and has 27,500 shares.

Mr Hill, who lives in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, took the video on the M62 near Lofthouse, a West Yorkshire village in between Wakefield and Leeds.

The Highways Agency said the video shows 'vortex shedding' - when the natural frequency of a lamp column matches the speed of the wind.

A spokesman for the agency told MailOnline that the phenomenon ‘only happens at certain wind speeds and is a known but fairly rare event’.

Married Mr Hill - who has previously lived in Luton, Dunstable and Manchester - has his own tiling company but used to be a truck driver.

Much of the country was gripped by major disruption today as ‘thundersnow’ storms brought travel chaos, closing roads and an airport.
