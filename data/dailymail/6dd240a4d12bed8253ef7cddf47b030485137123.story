A Premier League footballer with a history of losing consciousness collapsed just seven minutes into a match last night.

Bafetimbi Gomis went to ground during Swansea City's game at Tottenham Hotspur in north London as the players made their way to restart after a goal.

The 29-year-old France striker was attended to for four minutes and left the field on a stretcher - by which point he was conscious and wearing an oxygen mask.

Collapsed: Footballer Bafetimbi Gomis went to ground during Swansea City's game at Tottenham Hotspur

Help: The striker, a summer signing from Lyon, was attended to for four minutes and left the field a stretcher

On the ground: Gomis has a history of losing consciousness, fainting three times since joining Lyon in 2004 

But Gomis told supporters after the game on Twitter: ‘I wanted to reassure you concerning my health - it actually looks much more scary than physically dangerous, and I am feeling well now.'

He added: ‘I have been under a great deal of stress and fatigue due to my father's health that requires me to go back and forth to France. 

'I was disappointed that I couldn't help my team tonight, but now everything is back in order. I also want to thank everyone for their support and get well messages.’

Gomis, a summer signing from Lyon, collapsed after Nacer Chadli gave Spurs an early lead. A Swansea spokesman said last night that Gomis was in a 'stable condition' following the incident.

He added: 'He is fine. He is in the medical room. It is something we have been aware of - it is something called a vasovagal condition.

'We have always been aware of it and it has happened before. He has had all the medical and cardiology tests with us.'

The striker - who earns £50,000 a week - has a history of losing consciousness, fainting three times since joining Lyon in 2004, with the latest episode occurring while training with France in 2009.

At the time, Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas admitted he was ‘worried’ about the striker. 

‘We can't not be worried, it scares you each time,’ he told ITele. 

‘A vasovagal episode (fainting) is part of the things that can happen to people who have this type of constitution. It's now three times that it's happened. Yes, I'm worried.’

Last night, BBC Match of the Day host and former England footballer Gary Lineker tweeted: 'Very worrying images at White Hart Lane where Bafetimbi Gomis has been stretchered off after collapsing to the ground with no one near him.

'Play has now restarted at WHL, which hopefully suggests the situation is not too distressful. Gomis has a condition with a history of fainting. Hopefully it's nothing more serious than that.

Meanwhile, Swansea-born former footballer John Hartson said: 'Hope Bafetimbi Gomis is okay and recovering in hospital after collapsing in the game tonight at White Hart Lane. Thinking of him.'

And BBC Sport commentator Conor McNamara added: 'Gomis underwent a series of medical tests for fainting episodes in 2009 which indicated no serious threat to his health.' 

The match finished 3-2 to Tottenham, with Ryan Mason and Andros Townsend scoring the other two goals for Spurs - while Ki Sung-yueng and Gylfi Sigurdsson replied for the Swans. 

White Hart Lane was the ground where the then Bolton Wanderers midfielder Fabrice Muamba suffered a cardiac arrest in an FA Cup quarter-final match three years ago on March 17, 2012.

Muamba received lengthy attention on the pitch and it later emerged that his heart had stopped for 78 minutes. Although he recovered and left hospital a month later, he retired from playing.
