An heir to a sprawling country estate has spoken of the moment voices told him to quit his life as a wealthy landowner, shave his head and go to Australia on a spiritual odyssey.

Napier Marten gave up the Crichel Estate in Dorset and the £115million family fortune because of a voice 'inside of me saying daily and sometimes many times daily to shave my head and go to Australia.' 

The 54-year-old spoke of how in 1996 he dropped his former life and travelled to Australia - stopping in Maui to shave his head - because his life of privilege had brought him to a point 'where everything in my life materially was a completely empty shell', reports The Sunday Times.

Marten made the revelation in an interview that appeared on Youtube last month.

He was talking to equine-assisted psychotherapist Josephine Sellers, a woman he believes he knew in a previous life 400 years ago when he was a priest tutoring her when she was the daughter of a noble Dorset house.

He told her: 'Even with small children, I had to leave the house and go pretty much overnight.

'I do recall having a recognition of myself that I was exhibiting some sort of courage, but of course in many other people's minds I was exhibiting some sort of cowardice.'

While on the trip he shaved his head, a gesture intended as a 'two finger' renunciation of his previous life as a wealthy scion, and went whale watching, an event he found so emotional it left him crying 'almost non-stop' for a week.

In Australia he joined a group of Aborigines on top of a cliff and claims to have had an out-of-body experience, where his consciousness was able to observe his own sleeping body.

He said: 'I found myself looking down at my sleeping body... the next thing I know, I'm flying out into the ocean into the dark waters and swimming with the whales. It was a complete clearing out, a transmission of energy.

'These days of expansion unfortunately can't be repeated, but when one's in it, it is the most exciting part of your life.'

At one point he lived in a lorry and supported himself by working as a chef and later trained in head massage.

The 5,000 acre estate, which includes four villages, a cricket club and a lake, will now pass to his elder son Maximilian when he turns 25 in October.

The picturesque 18th century manor house was featured in the 1996 film Emma, starring Gwyneth Paltrow.

Mr Marten now lives a few miles from the estate and runs a tree surgery firm called Dryad, a name referencing tree spirits from Greek mythology, with his younger son Tobias.

He told the paper he had the 'agreement of his family' for his life choices but did not comment further.

The Crichel estate was put up for sale after the 2010 death of his mother Mary Marten OBE, goddaughter of the Queen Mother and child playmate of Princess Margaret.

It is reportedly worth £100million and comes with 100 workers tied to it and more than 150 other properties.
