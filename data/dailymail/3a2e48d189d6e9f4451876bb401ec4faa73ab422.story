Charmer: Juan Ramon Fernandez Paz, nicknamed Joe Bravo, was said to have seduced female security guards while in a maximum security prison

Italian police fear a trans-Atlantic Mafia war after the charred and bullet ridden bodies of two Canadian gangsters were found on the Mediterranean island of Sicily.

Convicted killer and mob enforcer Juan Ramon Fernandez Paz, nicknamed Joe Bravo, was discovered along with his associate Fernando Pimentel after an anonymous tip off to police.

Investigators said they were 'riddled with at least 30 bullet wounds' and an attempt had been made to burn their bodies following the hit.

One senior police source said: 'The hit was ordered from Canada. Paz was the main target and Pimentel was probably killed because he was with him at the time. The fear now is that their could be more blood letting.'

The bodies were discovered on wasteland in the hamlet of Casteldaccia, near to the city of Palermo, on the Mafia's island stronghold of Sicily.

Paz, 56, had been deported from Canada last year after serving a 10 year jail sentence for drug offences and was in Sicily negotiating with mob bosses in a bid to secure lucrative trans Atlantic drug deals. 

Italian police were aware that he and Pimentel were in Sicily after being tipped off by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and they were named as wanted in a round up of 24 mobsters earlier this week but could not be found.

Investigators say that Paz was working 
as the Mafia's 'Canadian ambassador' and was a key player in the 
multi-million pound deals using his ties with well known Montreal 
Godfather Vito Rizzuto as his introduction.

Fears: Police are worried the killings could spark a trans-Atlantic gang war

With his good looks and smart designer clothes Paz could have walked straight of the set of mob TV blockbuster The Sopranos but he had a fiercesome reputation who served time for killing his 17-year-old girlfriend after punching her so hard in the throat she died.

Connections: Police believe Juan Ramon Fernandez Paz was a high level player in the clan headed by notorious Godfather Vito Rizzuto

In jail he also had a powerful reputation, threatening inmates and using his influence as an enforcer for Rizzuto to carve himself influence and secure drugs could be smuggled in for inmates. 

He also managed to secure shipments of drugs from Jamaica and there were even rumours that with his good looks he had managed to seduce female guards at a maximum security jail where he was being held.

Unusually, Spaniard Paz had managed to reach a reasonably high level of power within the Rizzuto clan.

But as he was not Italian he would never have earned the ultimate accolade of Godfather and his own crime family.

Paz had arrived in Sicily last year and had opened a gym in the Palermo suburb of Bagheria and Pimentel is thought to have arrived last month from Canada to visit him, with the last positive sighting of both men being in early April.

Pietro Scaduto, 49 and his brother Salvatore, 51, have been arrested by police in Palermo in connection with the murder but they said others were also being sought for the double killing.

A police spokesman said: 'We had been monitoring Paz's activities for several months but he had not been seen since early April. He was named in a prosecution order to be arrested and we believe he was involved in drugs trafficking between Canada and Sicily.'

'We also think he was using his links with Vito Rizzuto to look into the possibility of importing drugs from South America into Sicily and then onwards to Canada. We shall be liaising with colleagues from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police as part of the investigation.'

Rizzuto was the Godfather of the Montreal Mafia and was released from a US prison last November after serving a lengthy sentence for three mob murders in the 1980's.

During his time in jail a bloody war raged between rival factions in Montreal for control of his empire and his son Nick was a victim, gunned down at the age of 42 three years ago.
