Tony Marsden, 23, from Whitley Bay, admitted inciting a child to commit a sexual act when he appeared at Newcastle Crown Court in June

A trainee teacher who was spared jail despite bombarding a 13-year-old girl with sexually explicit messages could now face prison after the victim’s mother appealed against the leniency of his sentence.

Tony Marsden admitted inciting a child to commit a sexual act when he appeared at Newcastle Crown Court in June.

The judge slashed a third off a mandatory two-year custodial sentence and suspended the remainder for two years.

The court heard that  Marsden, 23, from Whitley Bay, became ‘infatuated’ with the  girl last year.

The Mail on Sunday has seen the sickening catalogue of messages with which he tried to lure the impressionable teenager.

While he was able to walk free from court, his once happy and outgoing victim has been left  too traumatised to leave the house unaccompanied.

The girl’s mother later asked the Attorney General to look at the case again on the grounds of an unduly lenient sentence.

It has now been referred to the Court of Appeal for review by three judges.

She said: ‘My daughter’s life has been turned upside down. I have been determined to fight to get justice for her.’ She told how she printed around 24,000 Facebook messages – mostly written by Marsden – to show to the NSPCC and police.
