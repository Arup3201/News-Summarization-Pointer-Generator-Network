Amazon's invite to its TV event

The so-called 'Kindle TV' service has been discussed with at least three major media companies, according to reports.

The service is expected to combine live TV with Amazon's existing Prime TV and film on demand service.

Amazon already offers on-demand TV shows and movies free to customers who are members of Amazon's premium shipping service Prime, in both the UK and US.

It is believed the service could use a low cost box similar to Roku's, or Apple's TV box, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Earlier reports claim the set-top box is being developed by Amazon’s Lab126 division in Cupertino, close to Apple's campus, and is being run by Malachy Moynihan, a former vice president of emerging video products at Cisco who also worked for Apple.

It comes as Amazon has been ramping up its video content.

Amazon invested about $1 billion in content in 2013, according to Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Youssef Squali.

Last year it introduced 14 televisions pilots, which it financed, and is now monitoring customer feedback to decide which ones to produce as full series.

The Amazon shows included Alpha House, starring John Goodman, the Hollywood actor known for his roles in The Big Lebowski and Argo.

Bill Murray, of Ghostbusters and Groundhog Day, also appears.

Roy Price, director of Amazon Studios, the unit that is creating the shows, said: ‘I think the distinction between a regular TV show and an online TV show will soon fade away.

‘It just makes sense that if you’re trying to decide what TV show to make, it might be a good idea to ask customers which one they like.’

Each pilot is available on Amazon Instant Video or Lovefilm for free, with viewer feedback deciding which show will get a full series order from the company.

The company has also paid to secure exclusive streaming rights to hit shows such as Downton Abbey.

The firm also recently acquired video studio Double Helix Games,. fuelling rumours the box could double as a games console..

Amazon already has its own studio, developing games for iOS and Android gadgets, and this acquisition suggests the firm is looking to expand this part of the business further.

TechCrunch discovered leaked details about the acquisition earlier this week and Amazon has since confirmed it bought the company as part of its 'ongoing commitment to build innovative games for customers.'

Double Helix Games was set up in 2007 following a merger between studios, The Collective and Shiny Entertainment.

Recent titles produced by Double Helix Games include G.I Joe: The Rise of Cobra, and Silent Hill: Homecoming.

Rumours about an impending games console were reported last week by gaming blog VG24/7.

The 'gaming and entertainment device' is set to cost $300 (£180) and will run on Android. It is expected to go on sale later this year.

Any games console Amazon makes will directly compete with the likes of Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft.

The company is also starting from an established base of more than 200 million customers, and already has a strong software base, with its Amazon store, alongside hardware such as the Kindle e-reader, and the Kindle range of tablets.

After selling games on its App Store, Amazon decided to set up its own studio called Amazon Games Studios in 2012.

 launched a Facebook game called Living Classics, which was pulled from 
the site in October last year. Current games include flying game Air 
Patriots, available for Apple and Android devices.

 Amazon doesn't launch a console, it could be looking to use Double 
Helix's expertise to enhance the successes of this studio.
