From animated brown bears at John Lewis to Rosie Huntington-Whiteley on a magic carpet ride for M&S the competition for festive ad of the year has never been fiercer.

Now Sainsbury's are making a bid for seasonal stardom - and have hired an Oscar-winning director to ensure their film, Christmas In A Day, hits the spot.

Inspired by Kevin Macdonald's award-winning Life In A Day movie, the 45 minute film features a series of ordinary people celebrating on Christmas day in footage filmed by themselves.

The film has been created by Life in a Day director Kevin Macdonald

The full 45 minute film will be released on YouTube on November 29

Macdonald spent hundreds of hours splicing together the crowd-sourced clips to create a heart-warming feature film, a teaser for which is unveiled exclusively below for Mail Online readers.

The full film, produced by Ridley Scott, will be released on the 29th November.

Macdonald, who is  also known for his 
films Touching The Void and The Last King of Scotland, created the
documentary and the ad campaign from the more than 360 hours of 
festive footage he received from all over the UK.

'I
was overwhelmed by the creativity and enthusiasm of the people up and 
down the country, from every walk of life, who filmed their Christmas 
and shared it with us,' says Macdonald.

'I feel that the finished film stands out for many reasons – it is 
funny, moving, often beautifully shot and above all truthful.  I am 
immensely thankful to everyone who took part and to Sainsbury’s for 
making the film possible.'

Speaking about how the concept behind the film came about, Macdonald revealed that it originally began as an offshoot from his last crowd-sourced film, Life in a Day.

'It was 
completely unlike any film that I had made before, and it really was an 
experiment in creating the opportunity to hear and see ordinary people 
share their lives, their loves and their fears,' says the director. 

'And
while we were working on it we kept talking about what an "in a day" 
film might be like if we could just choose a particular day that was 
already significant to people, and thought it had to be Christmas, 
because it is the one time in the year when everyone steps back from 
ordinary life for a day and we get to stop and think about our lives in a
way that we are all just too busy to during the rest of the year.'

Triumph: His 2006 film Last King of Scotland, about Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, also took home an Oscar

He added: 'People have been hugely generous sending us more than 360
hours of footage. My approach to Christmas In A Day was to look at 
everything and think about what the footage revealed about the different
ways we celebrate or approach Christmas.

'There are so many 
experiences which are common to so many of us, rituals and preparations,
being with family and friends, or being alone, it was all there in the 
contributions that people sent in.

'I feel that the film stands out for 
many reasons, it is funny, moving, often beautifully shot, but above all
there is beauty in the ordinariness of it.'

Sainsbury's, who will also be running
a traditional food-based campaign over the festive period, say they 
hope the film will reveal something 'really interesting about the way we
celebrate Christmas.'

'When we saw the film, we realised it had far exceeded our expectations,' they explained.

'We
believe this film is something very special indeed and I am proud that 
Sainsbury’s has been involved in this project from the outset. 

'By
having the film as our lead Christmas activity, I hope we’ll encourage 
millions of people across the UK to watch the story of Britain’s 
Christmas in a Day, which brings to life how Britain really celebrates 
Christmas.'
