The Royal baby isn’t due until July, but its arrival is already causing much speculation.

And now you can add your predictions about the name of the future monarch in a Royal Baby Sweepstake.

The stately sweepstake, from firebox.com, suggests getting together with friends to wager on the infant’s sex, weight and name.

Place your bets: A new package suggests getting together with friends to wager on the unborn infant's sex, weight and name

The £11.99 package describes itself as: 'Ideal for offices, social clubs and fanatics of pre-natal predictions.

'The Royal Baby Sweepstake is your ticket to monetising the miracle of childbirth, while still celebrating with those kids from Cambridge.'

Meanwhile, William Hill are offering bets on a host of variables.

You can bet on all sorts of odds from hair colour to which day of the week the tot will be born and even which magazine will get the exclusive first picture rights to the baby.

New offer: The latest package costs £11.99 and lets you bet with friends on the future Royal

The betting giant currently has odds of 1,000/1 on the royal newborn being named Waynetta or Chardonnay, with Diana at 6/1 and Elizabeth with odds of 8/1.

Within hours of the news in December, tens of thousands of pounds had 
already been bet on what the royal baby will be called.

And less
than 24 hours after Kate and William were forced to confirm that she 
was expecting their first child after she was taken into hospital with 
severe morning sickness, shrewd souvenir companies had kick-started the 
kilns ready for a batch of commemorative keepsakes.

A mug celebrating the Duke and Duchess of
Cambridge’s happy news had already gone into production following the official announcement by St James’s Palace.

Finished with the words 'A Royal Baby
in 2013' on one side and 'Hooray for Will & Kate' on the other, the
commemorative pieces costs £19.95.

And
Dragons of Walton Street, the high-end nursery outfitters based in 
Knightsbridge, had already received a peak in interest in 
their four-poster 'Duchess cot' hours after the news broke.
