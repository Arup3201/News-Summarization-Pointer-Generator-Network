Click here to read Sportsmail's interview with Liverpool captain Gerrard in full. 

Brendan Rodgers has confirmed he wants Steven Gerrard to remain at Liverpool and for his captain to be given a contract extension.

Gerrard raised the prospect that he could play at another club next season in an interview with Sportsmail on Friday, after revealing that he has yet to receive the offer of a new contract.

The 34-year-old's current deal runs out next June and this is the first time he has ever come so close to being out of contract at his boyhood club.

In our interview, he pointedly said: 'I won't be retiring this summer. I will play beyond this season. We will have to wait and see if that's at Liverpool or somewhere else. That's Liverpool's decision.'

Rodgers, however, has made no secret that he believes Gerrard still has a key role to play next season.

Speaking to BT Sport before Saturday's match at Newcastle, Rodgers said: 'Steven is a wonderful player. The situation is very simple. I have already spoken with Steven's representative over a week ago so a real productive good conversation and we took that to the ownership and they are obviously now in the process of getting a deal hopefully agreed and done.

'In terms of Steven, he's a player of course we want to keep. He has been a big part of my plans since I have been here.

'I've said it a number of times, he's a player that going forward I still want to very much be a part of my plans so hopefully that can be done very soon.'

If Liverpool do not speak to Gerrard in the next two months, he would be able to begin talks about moving elsewhere on a Bosman from January 1.

Liverpool travel to Newcastle this afternoon and a win could potentially take them into the top four, though Rodgers is still trying to find the right blend.

It was a summer of significant change at Anfield, following the sale of Luis Suarez and the arrival of nine new players but the manager insisted he had no choice but to break up the squad that finished second in the Barclays Premier League.

'It was not even a bold step (to do that),' said Rodgers. 'It's what we had to do. We couldn't go this season with the same group of players. And also we lost a top player.

'So some of it had to be done. It was clear we needed to do that and it is clear that some of the young players that have come in, we've see their qualities. It's just going to take them time to adapt.'

Rodgers added: 'The players we brought in were not really established. With young players, you get mistakes. Then there is the lifestyle. You have adaptation, new players coming into a different way of life. It may be difficult for other people to understand it because of where we were last season.

'As I said the natural progress of the team was halted a wee bit because we lost a world class talent.'
