Surrounded by barbed wire, sandbags and mud, these winding trenches are barely distinguishable from those occupied by soldiers fighting in the First World War a century ago.

The two dugouts have been painstakingly recreated by a dedicated group of volunteers as part of a battlefield they built outside Chauconin-Neufmontiers, a town southeast of Paris.

Yesterday, dozens of volunteers dressed in military uniform stormed the site in a reenactment of the First Battle of the Marne - which took place 100 years ago this weekend.

The conflict marked the turning point in Germany's advance on Paris in 1914.

For the last four months the group, many of whom had parents who served in the war, have spent time preparing the battlefield, made up of one German and one French trench.

Their designs were based on military plans that were recovered - which were carefully followed to ensure historical accuracy, according to blog Histoire et Collection.

They thought of every last detail - making sure the sandbags are punctured with bullet holes, and that the crosses in a nearby 'cemetery' have names marked on them.

Recycled materials - including logs and bedsheets - were used to build the battlefield, which also includes an infirmary and cemetery. One resourceful volunteer also cut a tennis net, which serves as barbed wire.

The volunteers - a number of whom were local farmers - even built a plane, the German Iron Cross painted in black on the tail, that is partially buried in the ground - as if it had been shot down in battle.

Visitors and schoolchildren have been given the opportunity to visit the reconstruction for free every weekend in September. The volunteers said that they wanted members of the public to step back 100 years and put themselves in the shoes of soldiers caught up in bloody trench warfare.

The group said that they had a duty to remember those who had fallen during the so-called ‘Miracle of the Marne’ which forced the Kaiser’s Imperial Army to abandon its advance on Paris.

After a week of fierce fighting, the Germans’ pursuit of the Allied armies was repelled along the Marne River.

French troops famously arrived in taxis from central Paris, where the population feared the humiliation of occupation.

Once
 the Germans were themselves forced to retreat, the war turned into four
 years of bloody trench warfare, in which millions were killed and 
wounded.

The Germans briefly occupied Chauconin-Neufmontiers, where the reconstruction took place, before French and Moroccan soldiers droive them out in the early days of the battle

In what is seen as a major change in attitude, President Francois Hollande will lead the tributes to the part British soldiers played in saving the French capital.

He will visit the Museum of the Great War, at Meaux, east of Paris, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the First Battle of the Marne.

French
 politicians have, over the years, been accused of underplaying 
Britain’s role in the world wars at the expense of their own efforts, 
and America’s.

But President Hollande has done much to reverse this trend – regularly paying tribute to the sacrifice millions of Britons made.
