A drunk captain abandoned his group of 30 snorkelers as they were face down in the Hawaiian ocean - in order to head off for a drunken snooze.

Although customers had paid some $100 for the expedition in Keauhou Bay, through tour company Iruka Hawaii, captain Spencer Erwin left customers in the bay and sailed off to find a peaceful spot.

Erwin and his boat, The Sea Wolf, were found drifting offshore by Pononui Lealao, a captain for another tour company Kona Ocean Adventures.

Meanwhile the snorkelers were rescued and taken back to shore by another tour boat.

Mr Lealao, who described Erwin as dazed but unhurt, towed the Sea Wolf back to Honokohau Harbor.

Mr Lealao told Hawaii TV station, KITV: 'When they (the punters) were done with the tour, they didn't have a boat to go back to.

'The guy went out and I don't know what happened, he just disappeared.'

At the harbor, Erwin was welcomed with 
an expected wake-up call when the police were waiting to arrest him on 
suspicion of operating the vehicle under the influence.

Police have since released Erwin pending further investigations.

According to Erwin's Facebook page, he is both a captain at Iruka Tours and Ko Olina Ocean adventures.

His place of residence is listed as Kailua, a beach resort known for its turquoise waters and white sands. The beach is also known for its water sports.

But although Erwin works in Hawaii, 
his page shows that he is originally from Wisconsin as is listed as 
having studied at the University of Winsconsin.

Tour company Iruka Hawaii has apologized for the incident and tours have been suspended temporarily.
