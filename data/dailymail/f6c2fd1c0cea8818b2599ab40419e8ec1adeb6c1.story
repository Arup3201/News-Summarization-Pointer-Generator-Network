Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has confirmed that Daniel Sturridge will miss 'two to four weeks' after picking up a calf injury in training last week.

The 25-year-old has been out of action since suffering a thigh problem while on England duty before their Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland.

And Rodgers confirmed that Sturridge's latest setback is likely to keep him out of their next six fixtures, including the trip to Real Madrid on November 4 and the showdown with Chelsea at Anfield on November 8.

After Liverpool's 3-2 win over QPR on Sunday, Rodgers told the club's official website: 'He was returning from his thigh injury and medically everything was fine with that.

'Then, on his very first morning, he was jogging around the pitch in the warm-up - there was no action, no striking of a ball. He was jogging around the field and then in the actual warm-up, he felt his calf a little tight.

'The scan shows that there is a little bit of damage in his calf. So the medical team tell me it's probably between two to four weeks, which is a huge disappointment for us. But we have enough players now.

'We need to keep rallying forward and hope Daniel gets back sooner rather than later.'

Liverpool's victory at Loftus Road on Sunday was the first of seven games in 21 days in all competitions before the next international break.

Sturridge is also a doubt for England’s next Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia at Wembley on November 15.
