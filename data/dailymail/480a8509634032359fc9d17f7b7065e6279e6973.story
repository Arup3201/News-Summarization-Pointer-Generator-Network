Facial hair can be itchy and uncomfortable, but nothing quite compares to the beards several brave souls donned at Clovermead Adventure Farm near Ontario, Canada.

At the annual Clovermead Bee Beard Competition contestants heads and upper torsos are covered by 'beards' made up of thousands of the buzzing insects.

Now in its 9th year, contestants cover themselves in bees and then strut their insect facial fashions on the catwalk for gathered crowds.

The buzzing beards typically weigh for pounds each and are made up of approximately 13,000- 16,000 bees, according to the St. Thomas Times Journal.

To entice the swarms of honey bees to land contestants wear a queen bee in cage from around their neck, the Journal reports.

Bee keepers then help to brush on and shape the growing mass of insects into a 'beard.'

Bees flock on to the contestants faces and upper torsos around their queen as the recognize and are drawn to her scent, the BBC reports.

Veteran competitors use petrolatum, a substance bees avoid, to help sculpt and 'grow' their bee beards into particular shapes, the news organization goes on to report.

In addition, to keep the participants from being stung the bee keepers keep the colonies well feed with sugar water and sedate the bees with smoke before letting them amass on the contestants.

To determine the weight of the beards judges weight the contestants before and after the bees collect on their face, according to the BBC.

It takes about 5,000 bees to weight a pound.

Officials also judge the contestants based on the beard's style and the performance each person puts on for the audience. In the past contestants on the catwalk have managed to hula hoop while covering by the stinging insects.
