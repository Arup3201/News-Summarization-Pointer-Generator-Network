A super-fit great-grandmother is still working out three times a week despite being 100-years-old.

Louise Smith, from Croydon, will turn 101 next month but is showing no sign of slowing down.

She uses the treadmill and cross trainer, lifts weights, swims and does aerobics classes - and takes her 79-year-old daughter along to classes for the over-65s.

Mrs Smith, who retired as a nurse in 1980, is the oldest member of Solutions Health and Fitness Club in Croydon. She will be 101 next month but is showing no signs of slowing down

Mrs Smith, who retired as a nurse in 1980, is the oldest member of Solutions Health and Fitness Club in Croydon.

She said: ‘I do almost everything - I go on the machines, I do aerobics, I go in the swimming pool.

‘I have done it for a long time and I still go because it makes me feel healthy. When I can I go three times a week, sometimes if I can I go four.

‘I've made lots of friends there. Everybody knows me.’

Mrs Smith, who has three grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren, visits the gym with her 79-year-old daughter Irene and her friend.

And the unstoppable centenarian cited two reasons for her unfailing energy.

Until two weeks ago, Mrs Smith thought she was 97 but then her niece sent her birth certificate over from Jamaica which revealed her real age

Louise Smith, 100, goes to the gym three times a week. She does aerobics, swimming, cross training, weight lifting and goes on the treadmill

She said: ‘My secret is I eat good food and I don't worry much. I eat lots of fruit and vegetables and don't drink much alcohol.’

But while she can now claim to be the borough's eldest gym-goer, a fortnight ago she had no idea she had clocked up a century of life.

Mrs Smith, who moved from Jamaica in the 1960s, said: ‘Everybody thought I was 97 but then my niece in Jamaica sent my birth certificate. I didn't know my age and wanted to get it clear.

‘I knew the date but I didn't know the 
year because my mum never told me before she died. When I started work I
had to write my age but I didn't know it, so I just guessed.

She said: 'I do almost everything - I go on the machines, I do aerobics, I go in the swimming pool. I have done it for a long time and I still go because it makes me feel healthy. When I can I go three times a week'

‘It was a surprise to find I'm 100 but I feel good about it.’

Phil Colwell, manager of Solutions, said: ‘Three generations of her family come down here. I would have thought she is certainly the oldest gym member in Croydon.

‘People throw up all sorts of excuses why they can't go to the gym and you only have to look at people like her to see really there is no reason not to.’
