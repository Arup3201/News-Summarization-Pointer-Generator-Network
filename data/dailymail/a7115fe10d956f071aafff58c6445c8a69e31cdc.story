A florist's assistant almost cut off his arm after he slipped while carrying a vase up a flight of stairs and fell on to the shards of glass.

Davy D'agostino, who was in his first week in the job helping out a friend, was carrying the heavy, water filled vase when he tumbled with his right arm landing in the glass.

It sliced through his forearm to the bone, severing all the tendons, nerves and arteries in his wrist, leaving him in a pool of blood.

The 37-year-old from Enfield, north London, was rushed to hospital where he spent three days having surgery on his torn tendons.

He also had to have more than 30 stitches in his right arm to fix the six inch gash.

Mr D'agostino said: 'I only took the job because I thought it would be a quieter way to earn some more money.

'When I slipped I dropped the vase, and it broke. I fell right on top of it and the glass sliced through my arm.

'I sliced open my left hand because I tried to put pressure on the wound and cut myself on a shard of glass that was sticking out of my arm. It was agony.'

Mr D'agostino had previously worked as a professional dog handler and had been bitten, but says nothing could have prepared him for the pain.

He explained: 'I’ve been a professional dog handler for years, but I’ve never seen a dog bite that bad.

Mr D'agostino had to have more than 30 stitches, left, to fix the six inch gash. His arm has now started to heal, right, but he says he has been unable to work since the accident 

'I had my leg savaged by a Rottweiler once, but that was nowhere near as bad.

'My hand is still numb, and I’ve got very limited movement - so I can’t do either job.

'The doctors have told me that since I severed two nerves, the recovery time is estimated at at least seven years, and I will need more surgery in the coming months.

'I could have died I lost so much blood. Who would have thought working with flowers could have been so dangerous?'

And since the accident in August, he says he has been unable to work.

He added: 'Being a dog handler, it’s par for the course that you’re going to get bitten.

'So when I started working as a florist, I didn’t ever think I could get any more injured than pricking my finger on a rose thorn.

'I don’t know what I'm going to do now, but I’ll survive. You have to get on with things.'
