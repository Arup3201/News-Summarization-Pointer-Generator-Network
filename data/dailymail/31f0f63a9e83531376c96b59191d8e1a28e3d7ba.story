Squeaky clean Richard Tipper has staked his claim as Britain’s most prolific car washer after tending to more than 25,000 supercars at up to £1,200-a-time.

Dedicated Mr Tipper started cleaning motors as a 14-year-old charging £2-a-go to wash his neighbours’ vehicles.

Twenty-eight years later, he has become a professional cleaner, or car ‘detailer’, travelling around the UK polishing supercars and classics worth in excess of £20 million.

Machine: Richard Tipper, 41 from London, claims his 30-year career with a bucket and sponge has seen him clean 25,000 cars

Dedication: He will spend a whole day to make sure his customers' vehicles are spotless and sometimes will polish the motors for up to a week

He will typically spend a whole day making each car look shinier than when it left the showroom and once spent a whole week cleaning a Ferrari F50.

Mr Tipper believes he has now washed upwards of 25,000 cars and used 2.5 million litres of water - enough to fill an Olympic swimming pool.He has gone through 1,800 lambswool wash mitts, 1,200 drying towels, ten litres of pure wax and 100 litres of polish.

The valeter’s big step came in 1989 when he saved up enough money to buy a Vauxhall Rascal van and went full-time with his company, Perfection Valet.

He started working on fleet cars, cleaning up to 300 per week and, by the mid-1990s, was moving onto more exotic motors such as Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Porsches.

Today, Mr Tipper is the go to man for a number of magazines, high-end dealers and classic car enthusiasts.

A conventional valet costs £350 while his top notch ‘concours’ detail has a £1,200 price-tag, with the owner getting a hardback photo book to accompany the completed service.

Despite the eye-opening price-tag, Richard’s skills are something customers are willing to pay for, particularly if the car is worth upwards of £20 million like the Ferrari 250 GTO he has worked on.

Mr Tipper, from North London, said: 'Strict instructions were handed down to us by the owner clearly stating ‘she’ must not be enhanced in anyway, but must be merely maintained in her current condition.

'With such a significant history, a transformation of her "patina" could have had a dramatic and detrimental effect on the value.

Success: The professional 'detailer' once spent a whole week tirelessly cleaning a Ferrari F50

'The car was an original Series 1 from 1963 and the hairs still stand up on the back of my neck when I think of how lucky I was to have looked after her.

'It was certainly a career high for me. I often wonder if I’ll ever get the chance to work on another. I live in hope.'

Mr Tipper arrives at his clients’ properties in a customised van packed full of specialist cleaning products, waxes and polishes with one setting him back a staggering £3,000.

He has now ‘detailed’ everything from standard family cars to vintage vehicles from as far back as 1905.

Career: Since the age of 14 he has perfected the art of making the paint job look as if it has just come out of the show room

The meticulous valeter has worked on 52 different models of Ferrari and has also detailed the Le Mans-winning Jaguar XJR-9 and a Ferrari 312 T4 F1 car driven by the legendary Gilles Villeneuve.

Away from the world of cleaning supercars, the married father-of-two drives a Vauxhall Zafira people carrier.

He added: 'It is a tremendously tiring and physical job and my body and mind has had to adapt to the long hours, harsh weather conditions and general anxiety felt by a conscientious person trying to provide a service to his clients.

Commitment: Mr Tipper works day and night working on his customers' cars, including this Porsche

'But I’ve had few interesting experiences over the years. On one occasion, I was cleaning a client’s car when I removed the boot mats to find a stash of pornographic magazines.

'I was also working on a lady’s Porsche and when I found a bag containing 2,000 pound coins.

'She had hidden the money when moving home and, a year later, had completely forgotten about them.'
