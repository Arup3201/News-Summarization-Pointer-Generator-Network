Duets featuring Michael Jackson and Freddie Mercury are finally set to be officially released, three decades after they were recorded.

Mercury’s former bandmates, Brian May and Roger Taylor, are working on tracks featuring the two dead superstars and have promised ‘something for folks to hear’ in two months.

Guitarist May described working on the sessions this month as: ‘Exciting, challenging, emotionally taxing. But cool.’

The prospect of pop’s two greatest showmen combining in a musical reprise is a mouth-watering prospect for fans around the world.

Yet ironically the pair fell out after a collaboration in the early 1980s.

In what is thought to have been their only session together, they recorded three songs during six hours spent at Jackson’s home studio in Encino, California.

In 2011, May confirmed the Jackson estate had given permission for him to revamp the trio of recordings with Taylor and the pair have brought in US-based music producer William Orbit, who has worked with Madonna and Blur.

The tracks are likely to include new guitar solos from May along with Queen-style vocal harmonies.

Writing on his blog in reply to a fan, May, 66, said: ‘There are a few items in progress. We will have something for folks to hear in a couple of months’ time, hopefully.’

Jackson died in 2009, aged 50, after suffering cardiac arrest linked to his drug dependency. Mercury died from an Aids-related illness, aged 45, in 1991.

A Jackson family source said he believed the post-Encino row stemmed from the pair’s inability to arrange a second recording session.
