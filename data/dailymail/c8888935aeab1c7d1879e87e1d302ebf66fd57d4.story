Hatem Ben Arfa is heading for the Newcastle exit door after being fined for being too fat on his return to pre season training, according to reports in France.

The French playmaker has allegedly been hit by a £1,600 fine after Alan Pardew lost his temper with the controversial star when he arrived back from holiday 1.5kg over Newcastle's weight limit, say French paper Le Parisien.

Ben Arfa has looked to be carrying extra weight recently and has been banished from the first team squad but he claims any gain is due to increased muscle mass.

The 27-year-old is now playing with the club's reserves and will not be included in Newcastle's pre season tour of Australia.

Despite being a fans favourite, it now seems that Pardew will move the one-time Liverpool target on this summer, although little interest has been registered so far.

The arrivals of Siem de Jong and Remy Cabella have increased the pool of attacking midfield talent available to Pardew and it has been an open secret for some time that Newcastle are open to offers.

But with no clubs keen to take Ben Arfa on, he could end up spending the final year of his contract in the reserves.
