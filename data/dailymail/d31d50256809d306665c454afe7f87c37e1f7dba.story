A former cop who posted a picture on Twitter of himself pointing a gun has denied the photo was a threat against anti-police violence protesters and claimed that the activists were 'blatant racists' for demonstrating in places they deemed 'white spaces'.

John Cardillo, who served as an officer with the NYPD in the 1990s, is now a self-styled, right-wing media commentator and runs a data analytics company.

On Sunday, demonstrators showed up at popular brunch spots in New York and California to protest the police killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. Carrying banners, the chanting activists entered a number of venues that they had identified as 'white spaces'.

In response, Mr Cardillo took a selfie in his American flag baseball cap, with the camera looking down the barrel of a gun. He added the words: 'I'm really enjoying these Eggs Benedict so move along now. #BlackBrunchNYC'

Inflammatory: Former cop John Cardillo posted this picture on Twitter in response to anti-police violence protesters storming restaurants in New York and California on Sunday, organized by #BlackBrunchNYC

The chanting #BlackBrunchNYC activists entered a number of venues that they identified as 'white spaces' on Sunday to protest police violence, including the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner

Mr Cardillo, 45, who now lives in Florida, told Daily Mail Online on Tuesday that it was 'ludicrous' to suggest he was threatening protesters with a picture of himself raising and pointing the gun.

He said: 'My photo is protected by the First Amendment. I was sitting in my own home, with no one else there, pointing an unloaded firearm.

'I published the photo as an experiment to expose the left-wing protest community - those people who support violence, encourage and cheer the murder of police officers, along with rioting and looting.'

'Those same people who were offended by my photograph, weren't offended by people being hurt in the real world.' 

Mr Cardillo said that he was a fan of legitimate protests -  even if he didn't agree with the message. However he slammed the activists who descended on restaurants on Sunday.

He said: 'I don't support what they were doing because they entered private businesses and harassed people.

'I found those protesters to be blatant racists because they targeted ''white faces.'' What is more racist than finding a place that certain races go to and targeting those places?' 

Mr Cardillo said on Tuesday that Sunday's protesters were blatant racists because they targeted 'white faces'

Zane Jones offered a simple message to Mr Cardillo on Twitter following his gun selfie picture 

Mr Cardillo added: 'You could argue because of the level of criminal harassment that their actions were hate crimes.'

The former police officer went on to say that he did not believe that his Twitpic was inflammatory but was 'controversial', adding that it had brought him widespread media coverage. 

He said that he felt the image had nothing to do with his former job as a member of the NYPD. 

He added: 'It's my First Amendment right and was absolutely the right thing to do. I posted the picture to spark debate. It's controversial but harmless.'

However some fellow Twitter users appeared to disagree with the former cop's defiant stance. 

‏@TillmanRaymond tweeted: 'should protesters take this as a threat for there lives? B/c it would taken as one for cops if they did this.'

While ‏@zanejones426 wrote: 'some people just don't get it there enough pain in the usa right now think I pray u and other just grow up.'

A Twitter user called Ted wasn't pleased with the disruption and tweeted: 'How dare folks go out for an omelette with friends and family on a Sunday! #BlackBrunchNYC #BlackBrunch'

Dozens of demonstrators stormed restaurants and targeted white diners in New York and California as part of a 'Black Brunch' protest against alleged police violence at the weekend.

Once inside, they 'disrupted' customers' meals by reading out the names of African-Americans killed by police, including Michael Brown, 17, who was shot dead by officer Darren Wilson last August.

Addressing staff and patrons, they shouted: 'Every 28 hours, a black person in America is killed by the police. These are our brothers and sisters. Today and every day, we honor their lives.'

Throughout the day, many of the three dozen protesters - who also targeted 'predominantly white' restaurants in Oakland, California - posted photos of the 'Black Brunch' demonstration online.

Alongside an image of protesters inside a New York restaurant, Sharmin Ultra, tweeted: 'We interrupt your brunch time to let you know there is a war on Black lives. We will not stay silent.'

Although the demonstration were largely peaceful - with no arrests made - there were reports of protesters getting into heated discussions with staff and customers.

And while many have applauded the nonviolent tactic online, other social media users mocked it and some have even criticized the protests as 'pathetic' and 'ridiculous'.

Bob Owens said: '#BlackBrunchNYC is the most desperate and pathetic cry for relevance I've seen in a long time.'
