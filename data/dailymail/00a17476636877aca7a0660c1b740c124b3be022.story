Rika Okada, 29, whose body was found in a storage lock-up in Tokyo

A nurse’s corpse was posted across Japan in a six-foot box labelled 'doll'.

The body of Rika Okada, 29, was sent 230 miles to a storage warehouse in Hachioji city, west of Tokyo.

On the package the killer, believed to be a woman, had written 'handle with care, life-size replica human doll'.

The company that transferred the package from Osaka to Tokyo said that the order was paid in Ms Okada's name.

The killer had used the victim's credit card to post her corpse over 200 miles, and then had flown out of the 
country using the credit card.

The nurse had been missing since 21 March and the package was delivered 24 March.

It is unclear how it was discovered that there was a body in the parcel.

Investigators found Ms Okada had more than a dozen stab wounds, but did not have any defensive markings, suggesting the injuries were inflicted after death, according to local reports.

Just
 before she went missing, Ms Okada wrote on her Facebook page that she was 
going to meet up with an old friend who she had not seen for a decade.

The alarm was raised after she failed to turn up for work.

Yesterday a Japanese-Brazilian woman, also 29, was detained in China after leaving Japan using Ms Okada's passport.   

The woman, who went to school with Ms Okada, turned herself in to the Japanese consulate-general in Shanghai and was held by local police for a suspected immigration offence.    

She is expected to be extradited back to Japan by detectives investigating the murder.
