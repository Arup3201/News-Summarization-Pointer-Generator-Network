Nick Clegg today refused to back George Osborne’s demand for massive cuts in the welfare bill, arguing parents aged under-25 should not be banned from claiming housing benefit.

The Liberal Democrat leader said he would ‘knock on the head’ the idea of Conservative plans for a £10billion cut to the welfare budget.

But he said he was open to the idea of some limits on housing benefit, putting himself at odds with Lib Dem deputy leader Simon Hughes who said last night: ‘We’ve not signed up to cutting housing benefit and I don’t imagine for a moment we will.'

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today ruled out banning under-25s from claiming housing benefit, after meeting with U2 frontman Bono yesterday to discuss global poverty

Mr Clegg was taking questions from voters in Sheffield, where he is an MP, the day after meeting U2 frontman Bono to discuss tackling poverty.

Chancellor George Osborne and Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary this week set out plans to cut the benefits bill by a further £10billion.

And in his conference speech, David Cameron said he wanted to ‘look at ending automatic access to housing benefit for people under 25’.

But Mr Clegg said he could ‘knock both ideas on the head.’

‘The idea that of that £16billion [welfare budget] we are just going to scoop out £10billion from welfare which will inevitably hit the poorest before asking anything of the wealthiest, no. Flatly no. Of course not.

‘What I am looking for is as the country unfortunately has to carry on tightening our belts for some time in the future, who should tighten their belts first.

‘I just start from the very simple principle that when we are all having to make sacrifices you ask people at the top and then work down you don’t ask people at the bottom and work up,’ he told BBC Radio 5Live.

But Mr Clegg admitted it was ‘unrealistic’ to think that no savings could be made from welfare.

Limiting housing benefit was a key policy announcement at the Tory conference in Birmingham this week.

David Cameron used his speech at the Tory party conference this week to argue under-25s should not receive housing benefit

Mr Cameron said: ‘If hard-working young people have to live at home while they work and save, why should it be any different for those who don’t?’

But Mr Clegg ruled out a ‘complete blanket ban on providing housing benefit to anyone who so happens to  have been born 25 years ago or less’.

He said parents aged under-25 should be allowed to continue to claim state help with housing costs.

‘Because there are people who have got kids, who have suffered abuse, who have suffered terrible trauma in their families, who of course as a passionate society we have got to support them.

‘But do I think there might be some under-25-year-olds who don’t need all the support they get in the same way that under-25-year-olds who aren’t on housing benefit have to make their way...

‘Do I think we need to look for further savings in welfare, unambiguously yes.’

However, last night Mr Hughes vowed to block any Tory plans to remove housing benefit from those aged under-25.

Speaking on the BBC's Question Time last night, he said: 'It is not a done deal across the Coalition and I would not agree to it as proposed – I’m very clear about that.

'Are you really saying we should be depriving a 23-year-old mum of the money she needs to keep the roof over the head of her two-year-olds?

'I’m for collecting more money from the people who are very well-off in this country. Let’s collect money from people who can afford to pay, not take money from youngsters who are struggling with all the other pressures.'

Mr Hughes, who does not sit around the Cabinet table but is on the back benches, said his party leader agreed that the plans had to be blocked.

'Nick does agree with me,' he said. 'We’ve not signed up to cutting housing benefit and I don’t imagine for a moment we will.'
