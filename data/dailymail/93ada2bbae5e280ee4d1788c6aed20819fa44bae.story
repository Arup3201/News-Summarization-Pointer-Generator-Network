Inverness Caledonian Thistle remain proudly at the top of the table after capitalising on Ronny Deila’s decision to prioritise Champions League football ahead of Premiership points.

With a seat at Europe’s top table at stake - not to mention £15million - the Norwegian coach made 10 changes to the team that drew 1-1 with Maribor last Wednesday.

To their credit, Inverness took full advantage, although they required a huge amount of good fortune to score, Eoghan O’Connell’s own goal arriving via some questionable goalkeeping by Lukasz Zaluska.

Mix up: Eoghan O'Connell's second half own goal handed the win to Inverness Caledonian Thistle

Goals: Eoghan O'Connell (o.g.) 65' 

Celtic: Zaluska, Ambrose, O'Connell, Mulgrew, McGeouch, Henderson, Biton, Twardzik (Johansen 46'), Commons, Griffiths (Stokes 68'), Pukki (McGregor 46').

Deila’s predecessor Neil Lennon did something similar at this same venue two years ago as he prepared for a play-off second leg against Helsingborgs.

On that occasion, a teenage striker by the name of Tony Watt marked his first start for the club with a double in a 4-2 victory before going on to make his name with a much more important strike against Barcelona in that season’s group stage.

That day, Watt was backed up by the likes of Victor Wanyama and Fraser Forster but Deila decided to leave out virtually all his blue-chip performers, with stand-in captain Charlie Mulgrew the only man left standing after Slovenia.

In contrast, this was very much the Inverness A team. League leaders on the back of three excellent results, there was no cause for the Highlanders to change a thing and manager John Hughes selected the same team that rolled over Motherwell last weekend.

Hughes would doubtless be happy to send the same XI out every week but perhaps the greatest threat to this continuity is the transfer deadline.

Billy McKay has long been the star attraction at the Caledonian Stadium and, as August’s end nears, the striker is attracting covetous glances, not least from long-term admirers Peterborough United.

There was to be no goal here for McKay but it was his menacing presence that forced Zaluska’s error and he provided a selfless shift at the top of a unit that worked hard and knocked the ball around productively.

The Northern Irish international might have fancied his chances against a makeshift central defensive pairing of Mulgrew and O’Connell but it was midfielder Greg Tansey who fired off two early salvos, clipping a free-kick into the side-netting and then sending Zaluska scrambling with a 35-yard effort.

With Anthony Stokes, Jo Inge Berget and young man of the moment Callum McGregor left on the bench, Celtic started with Kris Commons as the principal striker, supported from wide by Leigh Griffiths and Teemu Pukki.

It was a ploy that didn’t last long, with Commons dropping deeper into a pocket where he could get on the ball, create and, when the opportunity arose, take a shot.

Celtic weren’t particularly fluent but created plenty of chances from Efe Ambrose’s improvised hook shot to Pukki’s double effort, each saved by the impressive Dean Brill.

The Inverness keeper was beaten, though, by a sublime effort from Nir Bitton, but the Israeli midfielder’s curling shot came back off the crossbar.

‘I’m an honest guy - we rode our luck,’ admitted Hughes afterwards. ‘We have Dean Brill to thank for a few saves but to beat Celtic, you need that luck.’

The champions weren’t completely dominant, however.

Mulgrew was forced to head clear from under his own bar after Gary Warren’s looping effort beat Zaluska and there was also a claim for a penalty as Ryan Christie went down in the area. 

Forlorn: It is another poor result in a difficult start for Celtic boss Ronny Deila

Referee Bobby Madden made a similar call in Inverness’s favour just after half-time when McGregor tumbled as he drove into the box.

Right or wrong, the moment signalled a change in Celtic’s approach as the youngster’s half-time introduction for Pukki injected some verve into the Celtic attack.

Deila’s other interval switch saw Stefan Johansen replace the toiling Filip Twardzik at left-back but, instead of improving things, the Norwegian was one of three Celtic players culpable at the goal.

Effective as a central midfielder, Johansen’s discomfort at full-back was exploited by home winger Marley Watkins, who outwitted his opponent before firing the ball across goal.

Zaluska underlined his perennial deputy status by palming the ball against O’Connell, who marked his first start of the season with an unwanted goal.

In Christie, Inverness have a real talent. Son of former Caley Thistle favourite and manager Charlie, the teenager is easy on the eye whenever the ball is at his feet and he perhaps should have marked this occasion with a goal that would have clinched the points.

McKay, who foraged hard without troubling Zaluska, set up Christie with the lay-off but the first-time shot slid past.

Substitute Nick Ross had an even better opportunity but opted for placement ahead of power, allowing Zaluska to make a save.

Despite Hughes inexplicably describing the last 20 minutes as being ‘like the Alamo’, Celtic’s response was non-existent.

‘The result is different class,’ said the Caley boss. ‘But I wish Celtic all the best on Tuesday night. I really do hope they qualify as it would be good for our game.’
