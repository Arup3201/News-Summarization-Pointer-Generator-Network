Labour leader Ed Miliband will admit in his party political broadcast that immigration has let too many low-skilled workers into Britain, undercutting wages

Ed Miliband will admit today that Labour was wrong on immigration and let too many low-skilled migrants into Britain.

In a party political broadcast tonight, the Labour leader will say that communities struggled to keep up with the speed of new arrivals to Britain.

And he will concede that the scale of immigration meant workers' wages have been undercut.

Mr Miliband will pledge to introduce a ‘One Nation immigration policy’ for the many and not the few.

But his party, which has consistently refused to support a cap on numbers, will again fail to spell out any firm policies to cut immigration.

In an astonishing about-face, Mr Miliband will say: ‘Low-skill migration has been too high and we need to bring it down.

‘That
means the maximum transitional controls for new countries coming in 
from Eastern Europe, it means properly enforcing the minimum wage so 
people aren’t brought here to undercut workers already here, and it 
means proper training for people here so that they have a fighting 
chance of filling the vacancies that exist.

‘There’s
nothing wrong in employing people from abroad but the rules need to be 
fair so that local people get a fair crack of the whip.’

In
an attempt to distance himself from Labour’s ‘open-door’ immigration 
policy, which let hundreds of thousands of migrants from new EU 
countries come to Britain, he will add that it is ‘not prejudiced when 
people worry about immigration, it’s understandable’.

Mr
Miliband will say that every foreigner who settles in Britain should 
learn English, and all public-sector workers who deal directly with the 
public must be able to speak English.

And he promise to step up enforcement of the minimum wage to ensure that migrant workers are not paid less to undercut Britons.

But
a Tory source said: ‘Vague rhetoric about One Nation does nothing to 
explain how Labour would control the number of people coming into 
Britain.’

And UKIP leader Nigel Farage said: 'What will you do Mr Miliband, about the relaxing of controls on Bulgarians and Romanians? Are you prepared to defy the EU treaties and take back our border controls? If not these comments are mere crocodile tears.'

Diane Abbott appeared to torpedo Mr Miliband’s change of tack, insisting Labour would not pander to ‘anti-immigrant’ feelings.

Writing in the New Statesman magazine, Labour’s public health spokesman wrote: ‘There is no path to victory for the Labour Party through the thickets of anti-immigrant politics.’

Mr Miliband will attempt to distance himself from Labour’s ‘open door’ immigration policy which led to hundreds of thousands of migrants from the new EU countries coming to Britain as the UK did not introduce transitional controls.

Nearly 600,000 European migrants came to the UK in 2010 alone, making Labour’s predictions of just 13,000 incomers from the new EU countries laughable.

Mr Miliband will say: 'One of the things I've done since I became the leader of the Labour Party is understand where we got things wrong in government, and change them.

'And one of the things we didn't get right was immigration, and that's why I've got a new approach. Millions of people in this country are concerned about immigration and if people are concerned about it, then the Labour Party I lead is going to be talking about it.'

He will add: 'Britain's diversity is a source of our great strength. It makes us a more successful country.

'But people can lose out if migration isn't properly managed. The pace of change can be too fast or people can see their wages undercut.'

The party political broadcast was filmed at Acton College in West London, where Mr Miliband’s late, Polish father the academic Ralph Miliband came to study English 70 years ago after fleeing the Nazis.

Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, will make a speech on immigration tomorrow in which she will unveil plans to crackdown on unscrupulous employers who force migrants into overcrowded housing and pay them below the minimum wage.

She will also target 'gangmasters' employing illegal migrants in the social care, hospitality and construction industries - including a ban on housing workers in over-crowded accommodation.

Ms Cooper is also expected to detail proposed reforms of the immigration system and action to improve the training of UK workers so they can fill jobs in shortage occupations.

The news came as Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said migrants could face a minimum period before they could claim tax credits and out-of-work benefits.

Sources said it could be introduced before the lifting of restrictions on Bulgarian and Romanian immigrants this year.
