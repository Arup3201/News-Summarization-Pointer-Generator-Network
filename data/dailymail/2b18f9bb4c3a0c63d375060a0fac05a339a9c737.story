A hospital allowed a pregnant woman to take her pet dog into a maternity ward so it could watch her give birth.

Managers justified the extraordinary action by saying that Barney, who is believed to be a Labrador, was a certified 'therapy dog' and had a 'calming presence'.

But the unusual presence on the labour ward in Bristol was criticised amid claims that no special cleaning took place after the two-hour birth.

Fury: St Michael's Hospital in Bristol allowed a pregnant woman to bring a dog into the maternity unit to watch her give birth

The dog is said to have been allowed entry to the maternity ward after his owner submitted a form requesting he attended the birth at St Michael's Hospital.

Managers said Barney regularly visits wards to comfort patients in his role as a therapy dog.

But a source told the Sun: 'Nurses and doctors were appalled but someone at the hospital had given the woman permission so the dog stayed on the labour ward.

'This is the first time any of the hospital’s staff can remember such a thing happening.

'They’re now worried that other women will be allowed to do the same because a precedent has been set.'

Managers insisted that approval had been sought from infection control experts and that a thorough cleaning was done after the birth.

Sarah Windfield, head of midwifery at the hospital, said: ‘Barney is a certified Pets as Therapy dog and with his owner regularly attends to patients in hospital.

'PAT dogs are examined and passed on health, temperament, suitability and stability grounds and patients can benefit from their calming presence.

‘His owner made the request to us for Barney to be present when she gave birth as a therapy dog, not as a pet.

'Having first sought the approval of our infection control expert, we agreed to Barney sitting nearby in the delivery room.’

It is understood that Barney stayed for the birth, along with the woman's partner and a midwife, before the family took their newborn child home.
