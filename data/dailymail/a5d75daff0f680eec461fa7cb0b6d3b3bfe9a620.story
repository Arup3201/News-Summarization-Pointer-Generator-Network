Train chiefs are laying on 3,500 extra seats for the Six Nations clash between England and Wales - but few will be as lavish as the Belmond British Pullman.

While most passengers will face late-night queues for a seat on the seven extra services being laid on by First Great Western after the Friday evening game, some wealthy England fans have paid for a luxurious alternative.

Travel companies have commandeered the Belmond British Pullman to offer eye-watering hospitality packages at a premium cost.

For this year's tournament opener on February 6, fans are being offered a £499 return trip from London Paddington, travelling in the lap of luxury with former England international Victor Ubogu acting as guest host and England and British and Irish Lions hooker Lee Mears also offering entertainment on board. 

Passengers will receive a glass of Champagne and canapes on arrival followed by a three-course lunch with half a bottle of wine, coffee or tea and petit fours.

On the return journey passengers will be treated to another glass of Champagne along with shepherd's pie (or similar), half a bottle of wine per person, water, tea or coffee.'

The package is being offered by VU Limited, the specialist hospitality company owned by Ubogu.

If guests want a match ticket thrown in they will need to purchase the £899 package which includes an official category 1 WRU match ticket.

Travelling on the Belmond British Pullman will certainly guarantee you a seat on what will be a very busy weekend

Elsewhere rival travel company Corporate Entertainment is offering a £789 package on the same train which includes the benefit of coach transfer from Cardiff Central Station to the Millennium Stadium.

The Belmond British Pullman  includes vintage carriages that ran in the 1920s and have since been restored by celebrated interior designers such as Rene Laliqué.

Some of the carriages have been used extensively by the British royal family while others have carried luminaries including French President Charles de Gaulle and Soviet Union leader Nikita Khrushchev. 

Two were part of Winston Churchill's funeral train. Meanwhile, for the average rugby fan First Great Western has announced that they will provide seven additional trains to take fans home from Cardiff on February 6, as well as adding carriages to usual timetabled services.

First Great Western development manager Mark Youngman said: 'We are delighted to announce seven additional trains will be provided to help Wales fans return home from Cardiff's Millennium Stadium, but customers are warned to allow plenty of time to return to the station as a queuing system will be necessary to help passengers board trains safely. 

'Those travelling from further afield are advised to check the time of the last service to ensure onward connections are not missed.' 

The usual post-event queuing management system will be in place at Cardiff Central station after the match, allowing passengers to board their train in the most efficient and safe manner.

Fans are asked to wrap up warm as there may be up to an hour's wait before being allowed into the station.
