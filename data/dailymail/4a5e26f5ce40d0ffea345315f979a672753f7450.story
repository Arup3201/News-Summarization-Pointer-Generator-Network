It all started as an innocent attempt to find clams, but left a small fox in a tense standoff with a 500lb brown bear.

As the two animals faced one another on the tidal flats of the Katmai National Park in southern Alaska, it seemed there would only be one inevitable ending.

But miraculously after running round in circles chased by the bear, the red fox was left to return to its search in peace as it appeared the Alaskan brown bear just wanted someone to play with.

A red fox appeared to be facing an inevitable ending when it was locked in a stand off with an approaching bear

But it appeared the grizzly brown bear just wanted a playmate, and the fox and bear played a game of chase

American photographer Nate Zeman was photographing the fox when he saw the large bear approach from nearby woods and head straight for the animal - a fraction of its size.

The 32-year-old, of Breckenridge, Colorado, said: 'The bear appeared from the forest, located about a mile away, and began to make a beeline straight towards us.

'The bear walked straight past me at a very close distance and kept going towards the fox, and began to chase it.

'The fox, however, easily outmanoeuvred the bear as it was chased in circles a couple of times, and when they stopped they both squared off about thirty feet apart.'

The agile fox managed to dodge the bear and neither animal seemed aggressive, not running at full speed 

And despite the tense stand-off it soon became clear that the bear just wanted to play. 

The pair were seen running in circles, neither at full speed, with the agile fox deftly managing to stay out of harm's way.  

'Most likely the bear just wanted to chase the fox, and it's as simple as that,' added Mr Zeman. 

'It wasn't aggressive enough in its behaviour to be meaning to actually kill, it just really seemed to want a chase!

The fox had been calmly searching for clams on the tidal flats of the Katmai National Park in Alaska 

But the red fox's relative calm was soon disrupted when a grizzly brown bear made a direct beeline for it

The 500lb bear was seen to approach from a nearby forest and head straight for the fox that was clamming

Both animals faced eachother, and at first it appeared there would only be one outcome for the small fox 

 'Soon after I took the photographs the fox walked off in the other direction and continued clamming, the bear lay there for a few moments before slowly getting up and sauntering away.' 

The Alaskan brown bear is the name of any member of the grizzly bear family that lives in the coastal regions of southern Alaska.

They are the second largest type of brown bear in the world, only after the giant bears of Kodiak Island.

As the bear approached the fox began running and the game of chase between the pair began 

The fox managed to dodge the bear and both were seen running in circles across the Alaskan salt flats 

Photographer Nate Zeman said neither animal was aggressive and both seemed to be playing a game
