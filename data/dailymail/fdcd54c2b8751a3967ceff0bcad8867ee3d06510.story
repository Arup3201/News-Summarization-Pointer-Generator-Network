Cameron Jerome curled home a glorious winner as the Alex Neil era at Norwich City started in perfect fashion as leaders Bournemouth were left stunned.

Collecting the ball 25 yards from goal, Norwich’s No 10 took one touch to shift the ball and unleashed an unstoppable shot that soared past goalkeeper Artur Boruc and into the top corner.

It was even more remarkable given that Norwich were down to 10 men following Jonny Howson’s reckless tackle on Yann Kermorgant, which left the visitors numerically disadvantaged for the last half-an-hour.

The win was a deserved one - few sides have come to the Goldsands Stadium this season and matched Eddie Howe’s title-chasers like this.

Norwich had fallen behind to Matt Ritchie’s opener but levelled through Gary Hooper and successfully muted Bournemouth’s free-scoring attack.

It meant the ideal start for Neil, the 33-year-old who moved down to Norfolk from Hamilton Academical this week, and who observed from the stands after giving his first team talk.

Neil, who replaces Neil Adams, who resigned on Monday after nine months at the helm, now has something solid to build upon as the Canaries chase the play-off places.

The unexpected result ended Bournemouth’s unbeaten league run at 14 and keeps this most fascinating of title races wide open.

With nearest challengers Ipswich losing at home to Derby in the lunchtime match, the Cherries knew they would end the afternoon top of the table unless they found themselves on the wrong end of a hiding.

Eddie Howe had taken the opportunity to rest some of his big names in last weekend’s FA Cup tie at Rotherham - they still won 5-1 - but Callum Wilson, Harry Arter, Marc Pugh and Co returned here.

Norwich were also much-changed from the side that lost 2-0 at Preston in the FA Cup seven days ago, with caretaker boss Mike Phelan restoring Jerome, Alex Tettey and Martin Olsson among others.

And the visitors started the brighter with Bradley Johnson heading narrowly over the crossbar in the third minute after Redmond had retrieved Olsson’s over-hit ball wide on the right.

New manager Neil, watching on from the stands at the Goldsands Stadium, wouldn’t have been too impressed when Steven Whittaker was slow in clearing his lines and allowed Wilson to steal in and fire just wide from 25 yards.

Norwich had been the better side in the opening exchanges but Wilson’s warning wasn’t heeded.

On 18 minutes, Charlie Daniels slipped Pugh clear down the left and he broke beyond Whittaker to deliver the ball. Ritchie had timed his back post run to perfection and, after the ball evaded everyone, ghosted in to fire home his seventh of the season.

It could have been two midway through the first-half when the ball sat up invitingly for Pugh after Wilson’s crafty flick. His volley was firm but a little too high.

With Redmond making a nuisance of himself on one wing, Olsson unafraid to maraud forward on the other and Tettey storming through the centre, Norwich carried a decent threat and would soon be level.

Bournemouth were given notice when Jerome, twisting and turning near the byline, did exceptionally well to turn back inside and forced Boruc, whose loan from Southampton was this week extended, to block with his legs.

Five minutes later though, the Pole could do nothing as Hooper blasted home from close range after Turner’s flick header from Redmond’s corner. 

After a low-key start to the second period, the game sparked into life once again when Jonny Howson was shown a straight red card for a very rash two-footed tackle on Yann Kermorgant.

To compound Norwich’s woes, Ryan Bennett pulled up with an injury just a few minutes after coming on and had to be replaced by Gary O’Neil.

As expected, the final 20 minutes were a red and black onslaught. Ritchie curled a shot narrowly wide of the far post after Arter charged down the right and pulled the ball back.

And a few minutes later, Ritchie cut infield from the right and sent a low drive close enough to the near post to have John Ruddy scrambling.

But then, incredibly, the 10-men went in front thanks to Jerome’s moment of magic. Proof, as if it were needed, that you should always expect the unexpected in football.
