A Boston Marathon bombing survivor who lost his right leg in the blast has achieved his goal of walking on his wedding day as he married his high school sweetheart.

Marc Fucarile and his fiancée Jen Regan tied the knot at Fenway Park on Thursday, a year after the roofer lost his right leg, broke his left, suffered severe burns and was peppered with shrapnel.

The 35-year-old, who was the last bombing victim to leave hospital after undergoing a staggering 49 surgical procedures, had wanted to reclaim the week and create happy memories.

He grinned as he left the stadium, using a cane to help him walk on his new prosthetic and the support of his new wife's hand.

Standing strong: Marc Fucarile leaves his wedding ceremony at Fenway Park on Thursday with his bride, Jennifer Regan. They married a year after the Boston Marathon bombings claimed his leg

Happy: The childhood sweethearts had been planning their wedding at the time of the bombings

The couple,
 who have a six-year-old son, enjoyed a day themed with the colors of 
'Boston Strong' - blue and yellow - from bridesmaid dresses to the Duck Tour buses used to ferry guests.

Every
 detail of the wedding was paid for by the charity 'Love Runs Through 
Boston' after Regan entered a competition for an all-expenses-paid day 
by penning a letter about their relationship.

'We kind of all read them all 
together and we voted,' Adrienne Mendonca, one of the wedding 
coordinators, told CBS Boston. 'And I do have to say it was 
unanimous for Marc and Jen.'

Fucarile,
 who had been planning his wedding when the bombs exploded and put the 
plans on hold, added that he knew right away that Fenway was the perfect
 venue for the wedding.

'We were going to get married on an island, a beach or Fenway Park,' Fucarile told Boston.com. 'Once we found out [the reception] would be at the Hotel Commonwealth, I told Jen, "We're getting married at Fenway Park somehow".'

At the wedding, their vows touched upon their support for each other over the past year.

'They chose vows saying that they would be there forever for love and support,' Justice of the Peace Elizabeth Brennan Gemelli said. '"When you fall I will catch you, when you cry I will comfort you".'

Afterwards, they headed to their reception at the hotel and the Dropkick Murphys happened to be there and entertained guests with a few songs, CBS reported.

Family: Fucarile, who was the last victim to leave hospital, and his wife have a six-year-old son together

The wedding came as a day of joy following a tough year for the bombing survivor. He is still trying to adjust to life with his prosthetic, he said, and still uses a wheelchair 75 per cent of the time.

Mr Fucarile was watching a friend take part in the marathon with four boyhood buddies from Stoneham, Massachusetts when the bombs went off.

After the first bomb detonated, brothers Paul and J.P. Norden huddled with Jarrod Clowery, James 'Bim' Costello and Fucarale, not realizing they were inches away from the second device.

When it exploded, both brothers and Fucarile lost a leg, while Clowery suffered burns and shrapnel wounds and Costello was hospitalized with serious injuries.

A firefighter rushed to put a tourniquet 
on his leg and he was taken to hospital in a detainee van because no 
ambulance was immediately available.

In an interview with NBC News in May, he recalled how he pleaded with the firefighter.

'I'm like, 'I don't want to die,"' he recounted. '"I got a little boy and I got my fiancée. I don't want to die." He's like, "Just think of them. Just think of them. Keep them on your mind. Just hang in there".'

It wasn't until a week after the April 15 attack that Mr Fucarile opened his eyes for the first time.

He spent 45 days at Massachusetts General Hospital before transferring to Spaulding for 55 days. He went to the operating room 16 times, where he underwent 49 surgical procedures.

He finally left hospital last July and returned home with his son and future wife.
