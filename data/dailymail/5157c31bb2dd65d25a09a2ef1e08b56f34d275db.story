Happy marriage: The actress says she has cracked the formula with Percy Gibson, 48, her fifth husband

With five husbands under her belt, you could say Joan Collins is something of an expert on marriage.

But given four of those relationships ended in divorce, perhaps her rules for marital bliss should be taken with a pinch of salt.

The 80-year-old actress has shared the secrets of her continued happiness with fifth husband Percy Gibson, saying they never use the same bathroom, and never interfere with each others' lives.

She said: 'There are rules for living with Joan Collins, but I'm sure there are rules for living with anyone. We're never in the bathroom together.

'In fact, I think it's important to have separate bathrooms. He never interferes with my social calendar. I never interfere with his financial work. I occasionally give him advice on how he looks, but he's the least vain man I've ever known.

'The only time he looks in the mirror is when he's shaving.' Miss Collins and theatrical manager Mr Gibson - who is 32-years her junior - married in 2002.

She admitted she 'wasn't interested in getting married again' at first, but changed her mind after they became close friends and insisted her current marriage is 'for good'.

And despite her reputation as a strong-minded diva, she insisted she does not boss him around at home.

She told the Sunday Times Magazine: 'Day-to-day life with him is very normal. Despite what people may think, no, I don't wear the trousers in our house. I don't make him do the hovering or the washing-up.

'He's a man's man and he likes to take charge. He likes to be in control. I suppose you could say we share the trousers; one leg each.'

Dynasty ambitions: Joan planned a family with husband Ron Kass, whom she met through a mutual friend

'He'd also become quite profligate': The 
couple's marriage was already on the rocks when their eight-year-old 
daughter was involved in a terrible car accident

'I was fascinated by his talent': Joan met her 
second husband Anthony Newley, pictured here with their daughter Tara, 
while he was starring in the West End box-office smash Stop The World

In the same interview, Mr Gibson said his wife's romantic past never caused him to have second thoughts, despite the fact he was initially 'star struck' by her.

He said: 'Obviously, I knew Joan had "baggage" - her past was out there - but you don't marry Joan Collins unless you know what you're walking into.

'I just wanted to make her happy. Of course there was a lot of soul-searching about the age difference.

Co-producers: The actress was married to singer 
Peter Holm between 1985 and 1986. He became her manager and co-produced 
two of her television mini-series with her, Sins and Monte Carlo

'I didn't want this man around my daughter': Joan claims Peter turned into a fiend - angry, sulky and rude

'We knew it would impact on our lives, but we quickly came to the realisation that it only mattered in terms of the way it was perceived by other people.

'Can you put an age limit on finding love and companionship?' Miss Collins' first marriage was to actor Maxwell Reed in 1952. She later said it was a 'farce'.

She later married - and divorced - actor and singer Anthony Newley, businessman Ron Kass, and Swedish singer Peter Holm.
