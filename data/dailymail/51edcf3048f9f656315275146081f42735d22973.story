House Speaker John Boehner said Tuesday the Rep. Steve Scalise will remain a Republican leader after apologizing for a 2002 speech before a white supremacist group – a moment in his career he called 'a mistake I regret.'

Scalise, who confirmed this week that he spoke at a meeting of the European-American Unity and Rights Organization (EURO), will remain as third-in-command among the GOP leadership of the House of Representatives.

'More than a decade ago, Representative Scalise made an error in judgment, and he was right to acknowledge it was wrong and inappropriate,' Boehner said Tuesday in a statement to DailyMail.com.

'Like many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I know Steve to be a man of high integrity and good character. He has my full confidence as our Whip, and he will continue to do great and important work for all Americans.'

Moments earlier, Scalise released a statement distancing himself from the white power group, which was run at the time of his speech by Louisiana Ku Klux Klan founder and former grand wizard David Duke – a powerful Pelican State politician.

Duke had threatened to release a list of all his political allies, both Republicans and Democrats, if the GOP threw Scalise under the bus.

STAYING: Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise spoke at an international convention of white supremacists in 2002 while serving as a member of his state's legislature, but House Speaker is letting him stay in leadership

MY MAN: House Speaker John Boehner (right) held a press conference in June to announce the election of Scalise (left) as the House Majority Whip – and he is standing by him as the racially steeped controversy boils

Scalise said Tuesday that 'twelve years ago, I spoke to many different Louisiana groups as a state representative, trying to build support for legislation that focused on cutting wasteful state spending, eliminating government corruption, and stopping tax hikes.'

'One of the many groups that I spoke to regarding this critical legislation was a group whose views I wholeheartedly condemn. It was a mistake I regret, and I emphatically oppose the divisive racial and religious views groups like these hold.'

'I am very disappointed that anyone would try to infer otherwise for political gain,' he said.

Scalise insisted that his Roman Catholic faith has led him to recognize that EURO holds 'views that are vehemently opposed to my own personal faith, and I reject that kind of hateful bigotry.' 

Rumors had swirled Tuesday around Capitol Hill, speculating about Scalise's future.

After Boehner backed the Louisiana lawmaker, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the No. 2 Republican in Congress, also threw his support behind his colleague.

'Congressman Scalise acknowledged he made a mistake and has condemned the views that organization espouses,' McCarthy said in a forgiving statement.

Scalise did not address a $1,000 campaign contribution he received from top Duke aide Kenny Knight in 2008 – six years after his now-infamous EURO speech. 

But Knight himself suggested Tuesday to The Daily Beast that Scalise's hands are clean.

'Poor Steve Scalise is getting a bad rap,' Knight said.

'I don’t think Steve Scalise would come anywhere near a white hate group.'

Knight recalled that Scalise spoke for 15 minutes during the 2002 EURO meeting.

'Scalise appeared in between a representative of the American Red Cross, who spoke about CPR, and a representative of the local sheriff’s department, who spoke about setting up a local Crime Watch group,' the Daily Beast reported.

Duke, among America's most notorious white supremacists, was a political kingpin in Louisiana who ran unsuccessfully for governor after holding a statewide legislative seat in a district near where Scalise would later serve before he was elected to Congress.

Duke told the Fusion television network on Tuesday that he was bewildered by the media feeding frenzy over Scalise's speech to his organization 12 years ago.

'Why is Scalise being singled out? I don’t know,' Duke said. 'He was just going there, obviously, to tell voters about some of his initiatives on some tax matters. That’s what it’s all about. And I think it’s insane, this whole process.'

The former Klansman also issued a stark warning to lawmakers who may try to throw Scalise to the wolves.

According to Fusion, Duke 'said he has hosted both Democratic and Republican legislators at everything from conferences to his children’s birthday parties. He said he has met with Democratic legislators at least 50 times in his political life.'

He then threatened to release the names of all the politicians on both sides of the aisle that he's hobnobbed with in the past.

'If Scalise is going to be crucified – if Republicans want to throw Steve Scalise to the woods, then a lot of them better be looking over their shoulders,' Duke said. 

RACIAL ALLIANCE? David Duke (left), then grand wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in Louisiana, participated in a cross-burning in May 1977 near New Orleans; an organization he later ran invited then-state legislator Steve Scalise to speak at a meeting, and Scalise accepted

Liberal blogger Lamar White Jr. first reported on Sunday that commenters on the white-power website Stormfront.org recalled seeing Scalise speak at their event in 2002. Scalise talked to the group about tax policy. 

He has since said he didn't vet organizations that asked him to speak when he was a state representative scrambling for re-election votes. 

Scalise is also taking heat for his 2004 vote against the law that created a mandatory Louisiana state holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr, 

He was one of only six legislators in the state House of Representatives, all Republicans, who opposed the measure.

At the time, GOP spoekspersons said the party wanted MLK Day to replace another existing holiday in order to save, but Democrats refused, leading a small group including Scalise to mount a protest vote. 

Democrats smelled blood on Tuesday.

'Steve Scalise chose to cheerlead for a group of KKK members and neo-Nazis at a white supremacist rally and now his fellow House Republican Leaders can’t even speak up and say he was wrong,' said Josh Schwerin, a chief spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.'

Democratic National Committee spokesperson Mo Elleithee wrote in a statement Tuesday that Scalise's denials that he knew about EURO's racist mission don't pass the 'smell test.'

'These questions are just the tip of the iceberg – Rep. Scalise and all of Republican leadership need to start giving some real answers soon,' Elleithee said.

But Rep. Cedric Richmond, the black Democratic congressman who represents New Orleans, says: Scalise is being unfairly tarred and feathered.

'I don't think Steve has a racist bone in his body,' he told the New Orleans Times-Picayune.

'I'm not going to let them use Steve to score political points when I know him and his family.'

Meanwhile, the Huffington Post reported Monday that Scalise strongly condemned Duke in February 2004.

'David Duke is an embarrassment to our district and his message of hate only serves to divide us,' he told the New Orleans City Business Journal then.

HOLOCAUST DENIER: In 2006 Duke attended the international conference of 'Review of the Holocaust' in Iran, claiming there was doubt about whether Nazi Germany used gas chambers to exterminate 6 million Jews; a top Duke aide donated $1,000 to Scalise's political campaign in 2008

He said at the time that if he were elected to Congress he would push for a law that would forbid felons from running for office. Duke was serving a prison term for mail and tax fraud at the time. 

'I didn't know who all of these groups were and I detest any kind of hate group,' he told NOLA.com. 'For anyone to suggest that I was involved with a group like that is insulting and ludicrous.'

Scalise added that 'if I knew today what they were about, I wouldn't go.'

But he fumed that 'it's insulting and offensive for anybody to insinuate that I would affiliate with a group like that.'

Louisiana state GOP chairman Roger Villere said late Monday that he supports the suddenly embattled lawmaker, calling the controversy a 'manufactured blogger story.'

'For the 25 years that I've known Congressman Scalise, he has been an aggressive advocate for conservative reform,' Villere said. 'He has been willing to bring this message to anyone who would listen and has spoken to thousands of groups during his career in public service.'

'I've also known Steve to be a man of great integrity who embodies his Christian faith in his daily life.'

But prominent conservative blogger Eric Erickson is convinced something is amiss.

'By 2002, everybody knew that Duke was still the man he claimed not to be. EVERYBODY,' he wrote Monday on his RedState.com website. 

'How the hell does somebody show up at a David Duke organized event in 2002 and claim ignorance?'
