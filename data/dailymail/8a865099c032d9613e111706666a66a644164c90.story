'If you looked into her eyes she clearly wasn't there, she was stumbling and she smashed her head on the boot of my car and it didn't faze her,' she said. 

'The paediatrician said she was intoxicated,'

'She collapsed in one of the nurse's arms in A&E ... she was comatose and unresponsive.'

While Holly completely recovered from the incident, after she was kept in hospital overnight and rehydrated with water, her mother said she will not be sending her back to the kindergarten.
