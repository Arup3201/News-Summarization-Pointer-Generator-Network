Michael O'Neill must outwit his old boss Mixu Paatelainen to maintain Northern Ireland’s bid to qualify for a major tournament for the first time in 30 years. 

It was Finland manager Paatelainen who gave the 45-year-old Irishman his first break in coaching at Cowdenbeath. 

O’Neill revealed that the two old friends have been reluctant to compare notes so as to avoid giving away any more information about their tactics. ‘We’re similar to players, I think,’ he said.

‘When you’ve played at a club with someone and then you’ve worked briefly with them as a coach there’s obviously a relationship there. 

‘Obviously we are less inclined to discuss the opposition because he doesn’t want to tell me things I perhaps don’t know and vice versa. But we both know each other inside out and how our team will play. 

‘Regardless of what happens it won’t affect how close we are.’ Northern Ireland have never qualified for the European Championship finals, and last appeared in a major tournament at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. 

O’Neill added: ‘I think Mixu has done a great job. His job is quite similar to mine, you have a limited pool of players to choose from and he has got them playing in a nice style. There’s no doubt Finland are a good team but there is a dependence on five or six players.’
