Jin Cheng, owner of the Laughing Buddha in Maidstone, Kent, admits losing his cool when customers complained about the food and slow service at his Chinese restaurant

A restaurant owner lost more than £1,000 when he rowed with a big party of unhappy customers - causing 43 people to walk out without paying.

Jin Cheng admits to losing his cool when the group complained about the food and slow service at his Chinese eaterie.

One customer, who was so irate at the delays at the Laughing Buddha, stormed into the kitchen and started shouting at the chef.

Mr Cheng told the group they should leave if they didn’t want to pay - and all 36 got up and walked out after finishing their food and drinks.

They were joined by another seven from a different group who took advantage of the Saturday night chaos at the restaurant in Maidstone, Kent.

It has left Mr Cheng with an unpaid bill amounting to £1,128.72, yet he has been told police can't help as it is ‘a civil matter’.

He admitted yesterday: 'If I’m honest, I did have a bit of a breakdown on the night.

'I was very angry and told customers if they didn’t want to pay, they should leave.

'On top of this, a table of seven snuck out while I was talking to the large table.

'The thing is, the group of 36 people who took the offer and left had arrived late. If there was a delay, that’s why.

'Even if you don’t like the food, you can at the very least pay for the drinks.'

He added: 'I’m very angry and worried about how this is going to affect my business.

'My takings have been down since and one member of staff resigned after what happened.

'I spent three years building my reputation on Tripadvisor - now all you can see is these complaints.'

Mr Cheng said the large party ate a range of starters on the night in question, including prawn toast, satay chicken, spring rolls, spare ribs, smoked shredded chicken and crispy seaweed. He said they also finished a second course of crispy duck but walked out before their main course was served.

The Laughing Buddha was awarded a certificate of excellence from Tripadvisor last year and has 111 five-star reviews out of 169 posts.

But one customer who didn’t walk out posted a review describing his experience on the night as ‘absolutely shocking’.

They wrote: 'Had the worst dining experience of my life.

'The service was absolutely awful....by 10pm, having been in the restaurant for two hours, we hadn’t even ordered our main courses.

'Whilst we were there, 48 people got up and walked out of the restaurant due to the horrific service - they had asked to see the manager, but the manager made no appearance, so they got fed up of waiting.

Mr Cheng said the incident has affected trade at the Laughing Buddha - a Chinese restaurant and takeaway

'They had the cheek to add a service charge to the bill which we took up with the owner of the restaurant - after he had dealt with a similar issue with another table.

'Following our horrific ordeal, the owner ‘graciously’ waived the 10% service charge and ‘generously’ gave us a whole £3 off our bill rounding it down to £50 and telling us that he had already lost £800 that night as if we were supposed to feel sorry for him.

'He then stood up and turned around to the rest of the restaurant and shouted "does anyone else want to have a go, I’m standing right here?".

'The owner was rude and obnoxious and had literally zero understanding of how disgraceful the evening had been for EVERY diner in his restaurant - treating every customer as if they were being unreasonable in their expectations.

Several pictures of dishes from the Laughing Buddha have been posted on Tripadvisor including one of the Crispy Seaweed Duck, left, and the rice-based Nasi Lemak, right

'It is impossible to please everyone in this world, and of course there will always be the odd complaint here and there, but when an ENTIRE restaurant of people complains, and 48 walk out, you really do need to question what you are doing wrong - and not treat your customers as if they are being unjustified in their complaint.

'The food was nice though when we eventually got it - I’ll give them that.'

Mr Cheng said he has been in contact with the big group but says they are refusing to pay the outstanding £1,128.72 bill.

He is now considering swallowing the loss because he fears taking them to court will cost him more than the loss of earnings.

Kent Police said: 'He has been advised that this is a civil matter.'
