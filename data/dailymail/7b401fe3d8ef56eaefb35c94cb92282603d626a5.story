Barcelona defender Gerard Pique may have missed out on the La Liga title but was all smiles on Sunday as he attended the 2014 Billboard Music Awards with partner Shakira.

Having played in Barcelona's 1-1 draw with Atletico Madrid which saw Diego Simeone's side win the league on Saturday, the centre back later flew to Las Vegas with his pop star girlfriend.

Shakira, who sang at the awards ceremony, celebrated the performance by leaping into Pique's arms and giving him a lingering kiss.

The pair will have enjoyed spending time together before Pique jets off to Brazil with fellow Barcelona stars Jordi Albia, Xavi, Andres Iniesta as part of the Spain squad for this summer's World Cup.

The current world champions will face Chile, Australia and Louis van Gaal's Holland in Group B.

Pique met Shakira in Spring 2010 when the former Manchester United defender appeared in the video for the Colombian singer's 'Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)', which was the official song of the World Cup held four years ago.
