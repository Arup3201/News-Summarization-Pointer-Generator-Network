Panic: Essex woman 'beside herself' when discovered one kilo bars

A woman who stashed two stolen gold bars into her bra had 'no idea' what they were, a court was told.

Sheron Mancini put the bars - each weighing up to 1kg in her bra - in a 'panic' when detectives hunting a £1million bullion heist gang arrested her.

The 53-year-old was 'beside herself with worry and fear' when she found the iPhone-sized bars in her coat pocket after she and her boyfriend David Gale, 55, were stopped by Belgian police and arrested.

Despite being frisked briefly by a motorcycle cop, Mancini from Harlow in Essex claimed she had no idea of the bars existence until after being quizzed and led to the police cells.

Giving evidence at the Old Bailey she said: 'I was absolutely beside myself with worry and fear. I panicked.

'I did not know what it was. I knew it should not have been there. I took them out and put them in between my cleavage, not in my cups.'

She denied police claims that she hid the stolen bars in special compartments in
the bra as part of a bid to smuggle them into Britain.

She told the jury: 'It was like a living nightmare. It could have been anything but it turned out to be gold.'

A week after the robbery of the British registered lorry on a Belgian motorway last October, Mancini and Gale were pulled over by traffic police as they headed for a Channel port.

But the court had earlier heard the 
plot was 'doomed to failure' because some of the gang were being watched
by British police and they were all soon rounded up.

When stripped searched by an officer she tried to conceal the bars in her folded up bra placed in an examination box.

It was only when the officer picked up the bra to examine it that the bars fell out, it was claimed.

Her partner Gale has admitted being part of a gang who planned the heist of gold and silver bullion from the back of a lorry in Belgium driven by gang member Brian Mulcahay.

Guilty: Stepdad David Chatwood admits role in robbery

TV’s The Only Way Is Essex stars Sam 
and Billie Faiers stepdad David Chatwood, 58, Mulcahay, 46, Matthew 
Middleton, 42, Gary Cummings, 51, and Stanley Rose, 75, have also 
pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal.

Mancini is standing trial along with John Corley, 52, and father and son Andreas and Kayracos Nicolas, 50 and 30. They all deny the charges against them.

Corley declined to give evidence while Andreas and Kyriacos Nicolas, said to be wealthy import/exporters, told the court they were approached by Corley about buying gold.

But the alleged deal was never done because they expected scrap gold and the men selling the bullion failed to produce paperwork to prove they owned it.

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
