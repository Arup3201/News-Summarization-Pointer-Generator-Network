Clueless: 17-year-old Shamichael Manuel says she didn't know she was about to be attacked the day she was invited by her friend Sharkneisha and a group of girls to an apartment after school

Shamichael was so oblivious, she 
didn't think twice when Sharkeisha and a group of girls invited her over
 to an apartment after school.

The
 video shows what happens next. Shamichel shows up outside the apartment
 clutching her backpack when she's sucker punched by Sharkeisha. 
Sharkeisha continues to hit and kick Shamichael before being held back 
by friends.

Shamichael says she never even saw the hit coming.

'I was just in shock. I was just like "Oh my god, like did she really do that?"' Shamichael said. 'You're supposed to be my close, close friend.'

Shamichael believes she was set up by Sharkeisha and the group of girls who wanted revenge over a boyfriend.

After the fight, Shamichael released pictures of her black eye and busted lip, but those injuries have since healed.

Wrong: Shamichael's mother Olivia Henderson says that the video glorifies Sharkeisha's behavior

However, the terror of being attacked and in such a public way is a scar that's never going to fade.

'I'm going to have to deal with this for the rest of my life,' Shamichael said. 'How would you feel like if that was your daughter and your son and that happened to them?'

Shamichael's mother Olivia Henderson certainly knows the feeling.

Ms Henderson says the video glorifies Sharkeisha and taunts her daughter.

'I was in the grocery store, and the girl was checking out my groceries. The baggers were just laughing and talking about it. I said that's my daughter in that video, and their whole expression changed,' she said.

It's not clear whether charges have been pressed against the girl named Sharkeisha.

While Twitter and Facebook users originally identified the woman as 22-year-old Sharkeisha Tyeshia Thompson of North Carolina, Shamichael says the girl who attacked her was 16, attending school with her in Harris County, Texas.
