It is the nuclear center of inauguration security, but it’s nowhere near the National Mall.

The Multi-Agency Communications Center (MACC) has set up its security services in an undisclosed location in Maryland to monitor President Obama’s second swearing in, with the sole purpose of monitoring the event and keeping everyone safe.

In all, 42 separate agencies will be in the room for the January 21st event to ensure the event runs without incident.

Monitored: Images of the U.S. Capitol and downtown Washington appear on screens at the Multi-Agency Communications Center (MACC) in an undisclosed location in the Maryland suburbs near Washington

Purpose: Reporters interview officials, including FBI Acting Assistant Director in Charge Debra Evans Smith, right; the MACC is in an undisclosed central location where officials can monitor the inauguration for possible threats

Warning: The phones at MACC warn its users not to discuss classified information

The MACC center is stocked with top-of-the-line secure equipment, and is set up to monitor every camera feed in real time.

Local government, federal agents, 
including the FBI, and the military, have all collaborated efforts, with
42 government agencies involved in all.

Janet Napolitano, the Secretary of 
Homeland Security, said she hopes everything will go according to plan. 
‘We hope and plan for and anticipate a safe and secure inauguration and 
one that will be memorable and historic,’ she said, according to WJLA.

The political ‘mission control’ is a 
way to keep each separate agency on the same page if an incident does 
occur, the station said.

D.C. Metropolitan Police Department 
Chief Cathy Lanier said that authorities have gone to great lengths to 
ensure that hiccups from four years ago do not happen again.

All together now: Representatives from 42 government agencies will be at the MACC to ensure everything runs smoothly

Trial run: On January 13, actors ran a trial run of the inauguration, standing in for the political figures

One thing, she said, was having 500 
pole-mounted signs directing ticket-holders where to go. Some people 
were turned away in 2009 because they went to the wrong areas.

In addition, NBC Washington reports 
that several items remained banned at the event, including backpacks, 
camera bags, chairs, umbrellas, knives, and explosives.

For Mr Obama’s first inauguration, a record 1.8million people filled the nation’s capital.

Local officials are planning for an 
estimated 600,000 to 800,000 people to crowd onto the National Mall to 
witness the oath-taking ceremony.

The MACC will open on Sunday and 
remain operational until Tuesday, when all ceremonial events correlating
to the inauguration are over.

Grand occasion: Areas around the National Mall and White House will be closed off, while many other areas will be available only to residents and authorized vehicles
