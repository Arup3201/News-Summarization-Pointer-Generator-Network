This is the moment a hockey dad loses his temper during a match and shatters a spectator window with a single punch.

The unidentified man was caught on camera at the York City Ice Arena in Pennsylvania as he got down from the stalls and hit the glass barrier, causing shards to spray over the ice.

One woman covers her mouth in shock while other spectators jeer at him. 'Way to go Paul!' a bystander yells.

According to the York Daily Record, the man, who is from Florida, was slapped with a $245 fine to cover the cost of repair. He was also banned from the venue.

The incident occurred on January 19.

Eric Menzer, who is part of arena's management team, says that it is unusual for the glass that surrounds the rink to break.

However, the man struck the panel with his metal wedding ring which resulted in a 'very concentrated impact'. 

Rachel Cunningham, who claims to know the hockey dad, described him as a 'very nice husband, father and friend.'

She says he feels 'horrible' for his actions but he felt he had to stand up for his daughter who had been knocked down by an opponent on the ice.

After he broke the glass, the tournament was halted so the rink could be cleaned up.
