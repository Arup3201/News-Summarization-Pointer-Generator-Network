A sex attacker convicted of raping and murdering a mother-of-two whose body has never been found has been jailed for life.

Martin Stafford, 44, abducted female security guard Michelle Gunshon from a pub in December 2004, before carrying out the brutal sex attack and killing.

The body of the 38-year-old has never been found since she went missing and Stafford has refused to give a location.

Evil: Martin Stafford abducted Michelle Gunshon from a pub in Digbeth, Birmingham, in December 2004 before raping and murdering her

A two-week murder trial at Birmingham Crown Court heard that Stafford was employed as a glass collector in the Dubliner pub in the Digbeth area of the city when he met Mrs Gunshon.

The court heard Stafford then murdered her before 'spiriting her body away' and fleeing the country.

Birmingham Crown Court heard Stafford took Gunshon away 'against her will' in her own car before raping her, murdering her and disposing of her body so that she has never been seen since.

Hours after the killing, Stafford was caught on a speed camera driving Mrs Gunshon’s Ford Escort around Birmingham city centre with 'something in the car' strapped in the passenger seat.

Mrs Gunshon’s last contact with anyone was when she telephoned her long-term partner, who she regarded as her husband, and daughter on December 4.

The next morning her colleagues noticed she was missing and when they entered her room they found her clothes and personal belongings, including her wallet, were still there.

She was reported missing and police found that she had parked her car, a Ford Escort, in Mill Lane, near to the Dubliner after returning from work, police said.

CCTV captured from December shows two figures, very close together, approach the car, before it is driven away towards Digbeth.

Following a 13 day trial, jurors at Birmingham Crown Court today found Stafford guilty of murder - as well as false imprisonment, rape and preventing the burial of a body.

After sentencing, Detective Inspector Simon Astle of West Midlands Police, who led the case said: 'This has been a long and complex inquiry and we welcome the verdict of the court today.

'We will not give up in our efforts to trace Michelle’s body.

'Clearly Martin Stafford can assist us with that and we will make every effort to provide him with that opportunity.'

Police family liaison officer, Bev Wright, also delivered a tribute on behalf of Mrs Gunshon’s family.

She said: 'Martin Stafford is a danger to people and should not be allowed out.

'We may have justice but our mum is still out there somewhere and only Martin Stafford knows where.

'Our only wish for the future is that mum is found and this can finally be over and we can grieve properly.'

Harinderpal Dhami, from the West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service, added: 'The successful conviction of Martin Stafford today marks the end of a very difficult and complex journey for the prosecution team in this case, which began over seven years ago and included the extradition of Martin Stafford following his conviction for rape in the Republic of Ireland.

'Michelle Gunshon’s body has never been found and the only person who could answer that question is Martin Stafford, who was asked this specific question during the trial having denied being responsible for Michelle’s murder. '

Mrs Gunshon, from Mill Hill, North London, worked for Special Events Security (SES), a firm which provides security at high-profile events across the country such as Cheltenham Races and trade fairs.
