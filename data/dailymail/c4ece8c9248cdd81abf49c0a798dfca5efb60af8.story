Amanda Knox's alleged links to a circle of Italian cocaine dealers could provide new clues in the murder of British student Meredith Kercher almost seven years ago.

The Italian prosecutor in the murder trial allegedly recently gave a local newspaper the names of the men, one of whom was a known associate of Knox whose number was found on her cell phone. 

According to RadarOnline, during the investigation into Miss Kercher's death in Perugia in 2007, police uncovered a drug ring in the sleepy Italian city.

Amanda Knox (pictured left) had alleged links to a ring of cocaine dealers whom she bought drugs from, it has been claimed in the Italian media, leading to suggestions that it could provide new clues in the murder of British student Meredith Kercher (right) in 2007

Knox allegedly had the number of a suspected drug dealer in her phone. According to Italian newspaper Giallo, the American met the student from Rome on a train from Milan to Florence and shared a joint with him.

They stayed in touch with the man, only identified as 'F', dealing drugs to Knox and occasionally having a sexual relationship with her. 

Police
 papers allegedly show calls had been made between the 26-year-old 
American and a drug dealer in the days before and after the murder of Miss Kercher.

Italian prosecutor Luciano Giuliano Mignini allegedly gave a local newspaper a list of drug dealers' names who were link to Amanda Knox

A Giallo article claims that 'F' along with two friends ended up on trial for dealing cocaine, charges that were brought after Knox's phone was analyzed.

One man, 'Luciano', was arrested in 2006 for attempting to murder his brother with a kitchen knife in a dispute over drugs.

According to RadarOnline, prosecutor Luciano Giuliano Mignini confirmed the link of the drug ring to Amanda Knox.

Mignini allegedly told Giallo that he could not say if Knox knew drug dealers - but wrote down their names for the paper's reporter.

According to reports earlier this month, Italian 
prosecutors are preparing to use Amanda Knox's alleged links to the cocaine ring to extradite her to Italy.

Knox
 has vowed she would never 'willingly' return to Italy, where she and 
ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito were reconvicted earlier this year of 
the killing of 21-year-old Miss Kercher. 

Both Knox and Sollecito are 
appealing the verdict.

Sollecito and Knox were originally sentenced to 25 and 28 years in prison, respectively, for the murder of Kercher in Perugia and served four years before being released on appeal in 2011.

On January 30, an Italian appeals court reconvicted the pair of murdering Miss Kercher - a ruling the pair are again appealing.

Rudy Hermann Guede is serving 16 years for the British student's murder after a separate fast-track hearing in 2008.

It was reported earler this month that Knox could no longer rely on Sollecito being 
her alibi after he denied she was with him the whole of the night on 
which Miss Kercher was murdered.

Knox and Sollecito have always maintained
 that they were together the evening of the brutal 2007 murder after 
which Miss Kercher was found half naked her throat slit in the cottage 
she shared with Knox.
