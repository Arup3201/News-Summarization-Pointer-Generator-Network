If eating bacteria-laden meat doesn’t sound appetising, then how about eating meat wrapped in a bug-killing film?

That’s the idea behind a bizarre material developed by U.S. researchers that could help prevent meat from spoiling.

As well as killing harmful bacteria, the film is edible and the researchers hope the product will some day be used in a similar way to a sausage casing.

A bizarre material developed by U.S. researchers could help prevent meat from spoiling by using essential oils and nanoparticles. Scientists at Pennsylvania State University hope the edible material will some day be used to wrap meat products, in a similar way to a sausage casing

So far, four different versions of the material have been developed by a team at Pennsylvania State University, led by Professor Catherine Cutter.

The antibacterial ingredients in the materials are made up of either rosemary oil, oregano essential oil, zinc oxide or silver nanoparticles.

Those ingredients are combined within a layer of pullulan, which is a tasteless edible plastic created by the Aureobasidium pulluns fungus.

Pullulan is used as a film in breath freshening tabs that disintegrate on the tongue and capsules that disintegrate in the stomach.

Everyone's done it - dropped food on the floor but still eaten it because of the so-called ‘five second’ rule.

A team of microbiologists has now put this theory to the test to prove once and for all whether this rule does apply.

The research was carried out by final year Biology students from Aston University.

The food included toast, pasta, biscuits and sticky sweets and they were timed from three to 30 seconds.

The findings confirmed that time is significant in the transfer of bacteria, but the type of flooring is the deciding factor.

Carpeted surfaces were least likely to transfer bacteria, over any period of time - and this was the case for all four food types.

Across the board, toast was the food least likely to pick up bacteria from any of the flooring types but only if it was dry. Toast with butter or jam increased the likelihood of picking up germs. 

Moist foods, including pasta and sweets could be picked up within the five-second window and not pick up bacteria – but after five seconds, the risk of infection jumped.

Once meat is wrapped in the film, the pullulan sticks to its surface, gradually dissolving and slowly releasing its anti-bacterial cocktail into the meat.

During the study, meat products were first injected with bacterial pathogens, then vacuum-packed in the film and stored in a fridge for up to three weeks.

When they were analysed, the four different types of edible film were found to be fresher than samples that had been packed in conventional polyethylene film.

‘The results from this study demonstrated that edible films made from pullulan and incorporated with essential oils or nanoparticles have the potential to improve the safety of refrigerated, fresh or further-processed meat and poultry products,’ said Professor Cutter.

‘The research shows that we can apply these food-grade films and have them do double duty -- releasing antimicrobials and imparting characteristics to protect and improve food we eat.’

The safety of eating such a film, however, is still under question.  The researchers claim that regulators still require evidence that nanoparticles are not harmful to the human body when eaten.

‘The meat industry likes the properties of the polyethylene vacuum packaging materials that they are using now,’ she said.

Knowing that edible films can release antimicrobials slowly over time and keep bacteria in meat at bay, further research will be aimed at creating what Cutter referred to as ‘active packaging’ - polyethylene film with antimicrobial properties.

‘Right now, we have two different packaging materials that are not necessarily compatible, leading to a two-step process,’ said Professor Cutter.

‘I keep thinking there's a way to extrude edible, antimicrobial film in one layer with polyethylene, creating all-in-one packaging.

‘The chemistry of binding the two together is the challenge, but we need to find a way to do it because marrying the two materials together in packaging would make foods - especially meat and poultry - safer to eat.’
