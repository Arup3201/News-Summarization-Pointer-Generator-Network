One of Pope Francis' newest cardinals has sparked outrage by claiming that homosexuality is a 'physical defect' that can be 'cured with the proper treatment'.

Recently elected Fernando Sebastian Aguilar from Spain, 85, who takes up his office in the Vatican in February, angered gay rights groups by likening the sexual orientation to long lasting physical aliments like his own high blood pressure.

The comments are in direct contrast to Pope Francis' recent assertion that the Catholic church should not marginalise gay people, but should instead treat them with acceptance and compassion; comments that were immediately attacked by local politicians.

Cardinal-elect Sebastian Fernando, whose outspoken views on homosexuality have been lambasted by the LGBT community as 'medieval' and 'out of touch'

In an interview with Diario Sur, the newly elected cardinal, who lives in Malaga in Costa del Sol remained defiant against comments from LGBT groups that his words were 'medieval' and 'out of place in this time'.

Aguilar, the only Spaniard among the 19 new cardinals, insisted the Pope's message about gay people had been manipulated.

He said: 'All he is doing is offering comprehension and compassion and showing a desire to welcome those who have gone astray.'

'Homosexuality is a defective manner of expressing sexuality, because this has a structure and a purpose, which is procreation.

'A homosexual who can't achieve procreation is failing. Our bodies have many defects. I have high blood 
pressure, a defect I have to try and 
correct in whatever way I can.

'To say that 
homosexuality is a defect is not an insult: it helps because in many 
cases of homosexuality it is possible to recover and become normal with 
the right treatment.'

In an interview about the 
regeneration people have claimed Pope Francis is bringing to the Catholic church, 
Pope Francis said: 'If a person is gay and seeks God who am I to judge?'

The
 Pope's recent messages on accepting and giving compassion towards 
homosexuals in the Catholic church earned him the award '2013 person of 
the year in 'The Advocate', a U.S. gay and lesbian magazine.Â 

When reminded of the Pope's speech last year asking for compassion towards homosexuals, he said: 'The pope is very respectful and holds all people in high esteem but he doesn't betray or change the traditional teaching of the church.

It is one thing to be compassionate towards homosexuals, and another thing to morally justify the practice of that homosexuality.

'You can tell a person what their weakness is but that doesn't justify a decision to respect them and help them.'

The 84-year Archbishop emeritus of 
Pamplona, one of 19 new cardinals named by Pope Francis last week, 
elevated archbishop to the rank of cardinal in recognition of his 
life-long service to the church.

However, he is not among the 16 cardinals who were given voting rights and will one day elect his successor.

Maria Gamez, spokesman for the left-wing PSOE party in Malaga, spoke out against Aguilar's anti-gay sentiments.

He said: 'These are not the winds of change that appear to be blowing from the Vatican.

'Pope Francis seemed to have distanced himself from these retrograde, insulting and anti constitutional theses.

'He should be asking himself whether a cardinal like this is helping the regeneration he defends.'
