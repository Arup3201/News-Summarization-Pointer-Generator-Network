A 40-year-old hiker has died after plummeting 100ft down a rocky cliff as he tried to find a place to camp in a Wyoming mountain range during a storm.

Edward Tom, from Colorado, and his friend had been caught in a torrential downpour of rain and hail as they scaled a rocky path in Grand Teton National Park.

The pair had been looking for a campsite near the 'Petzoldt Caves' area in Garnet Canyon in the Tetons, according to the National Parks Traveler.

They had planned to scale the park's peak the next day with his friend - the Grand Teton summit which towers 14,000 feet.

Mr Tom was searching for the campsite when he plummeted over the edge of a ridge on Friday afternoon.

Other hikers reached Mr Tom before emergency services, but according to the parks website he was already unconscious.

Two physicians in the area carried out CPR on Mr Toms until the emergency services arrived.

But efforts were terminated shortly after
the rangers arrived. Due to the poor weather conditions and fading 
light, rangers decided to wait until the next morning before evacuating 
the body.

The Teton Range is a subrange of the Rocky Mountains, which extend from southern Alaska to northern New Mexico.

It's highest peak is the rocky Grand Teton, which was first scaled in 1872.

There are three main routes up to the peak of the range - the Owen-Spalding route, the Exum Ridge and the North Ridge.

It is not known which route the hikers planned to take; the Owen-Spalding one is known as the most difficult and dangerous.
