Found: Police acting on a tip tracked down missing schizophrenic mother of two Catherine Hoggle, 27, in Maryland but her children are still missing

A missing paranoid schizophrenic Maryland mother found and taken into custody on Friday night has told police her children are 'safe' but won't tell them nor her husband where they are located.

Catherine Hoggle is being questioned by detectives but her children are still no where to be found.

Hoggle was charged with child neglect earlier this week after police realized her children, Jacob, 2, and Sarah, 3, had not been seen for days.

Hoggle has told police that her children are alive but they are not able to verify Hoggle's statements since she has given them varying stories about their location and she has been off her medication for schizophrenia.

NBC reports that Hoggle has changed her appearance by cutting her hair.

Her disheveled look has lead police to believe that she may have been spending nights on the street prior to her arrest.  

Police said just after 11 p.m. on Friday they received a call from a Germantown resident saying that Catherine Hoggle was spotted walking near Century Rock Boulevard and Crystal Rock Drive.

Officers were dispatched to the area and were able to quickly track down the missing woman, but her two children, 2-year-old Jacob and 3-year-old Sarah, were nowhere to be found.

Many gathered at the Chik-Fil-A parking lot on Saturday night for a candlelight vigil to pray for the missing children in the hopes that they will be found safe and sound.

Hoggle, who reportedly suffers from paranoid schizophrenia and had gone off her medication, was taken to police headquarters for questioning,wUSA9 reported.

Officers remained on the scene in Germantown overnight, scouring the streets and a nearby apartment complex with K-9 dogs in search of the missing toddlers.

'Thank you to this caller. We remain concerned for the children's welfare and ask that people still call 911 with information and tips,' Montgomery County police tweeted after finding Hoggle.

Earlier in the day, authorities released a video showing Hoggle sneaking out the back of a Chick-fil-A in Germantown Monday, just moments after lying to her common-law husband, Troy Turner, about the whereabouts of their two children. 

Hoggle was then captured on video again at the Germantown Commons shopping center on Tuesday morning around 4.30am. The children are not seen in the video.

Turner contacted police on Monday night and reported that the trio were missing.

The couple had stopped at the fast found restaurant Monday on their way to the police station, as Turner was concerned about the children and felt Hoggle was 'not forthcoming' when he suggested the two go pick them up at daycare.

Moments later, Hoggle went out the back door and walked to the Germantown Transit Center.

'I want it over with, I want my children here with me,' said Turner, who has been distributing and posting  flyers all over town in hopes of finding his wife and children.

Montgomery County police have obtained a warrant for  Hoggle's arrest, charging her with child neglect, a misdemeanor with a maximum penalty of 5 years and $5,000, according to ABC 7.

On Sunday, police said Hoggle took the children to her mother's house in Clarksburg.

She said she was  going to take her son Jacob for pizza, but when she returned to her mother's home three hours later, she did not have him with her.

Hoggle claimed Jacob was at a playmate's house, but police said Jacob was not there and the youngster has not been seen since.

Police understand that at the time Turner was at his overnight job.

Sarah was last seen on Monday at Hoggle's mother's home.  

Hoggle and Turner also have another son together, whose whereabouts is known.
