A young driver accused of killing two bicyclists while high on a cocktail of drugs and alcohol told witnesses her dead mother was coming to get her after the tragic crash, it has emerged.

Darriean Hess is awaiting trial on charges of negligent homicide, DUI, second-degree assault and manslaughter after she veered across the double yellow line and into a group of cyclists competing in a bike race in September last year.

After sending bodies flying and plowing through a sign that read 'Welcome to Seabrook Beach,' the troubled New Hampshire 19-year-old's Honda came to a stop and, hysterical in the driver's seat, she told worried onlookers, 'My mom is coming to get me.'

In fact, her mom, Cherie, had died six years earlier of a drug overdose, aged 48.

Darriean's siblings found their mom kneeling in the backyard with her face in the dirt, ending a chapter of 
heartache that only led to another.

According
 to the Boston Globe, the now-20-year-old is the youngest of five 
children. Her mother battled drug and alcohol addiction throughout 
Darriean's young life and her father, whom she never knew, had for years sexually abused her eldest sister, Cassie.

With
 her mother dead, Cassie left college and took up custody of her younger
 siblings for a period, then Darriean moved to Alaska, her mother's home
 state, to stay with her granmother.

She moved back to Seabrook, New Hampshire, in her late teens but never truly settled.

That hectic, drama-filled life culminated in the fatal crash on September 21.

Pam
 Wells, 60, controller of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, wife, and 
mother of two teens, and Elise Bouchard, a 52-year-old customer service 
manager, had trained months for the charity ride that day.

Nearing
 8:30 a.m, Darriean, driving 59 mph in a 30 mph zone, crossed the double 
yellow line and veered into the northbound lane, then plunged into the 
two cyclists and fellow riders.

Jim
 Schofield, a school bus painter from Manchester, New Hampshire, was a 
short distance behind the two women and witnessed, though he didn't 
realise it until later, their bodies flying into the air.

He ran to the Honda, and joined another onlooker in wrenching open its driver's door.

That's when he saw Darriean, sobbing, and clutching a smashed iPhone.

She told him she had glass in her eyes and her mouth and he told her an ambulance was on its way.

'Do I f**** look like I need an ambulance?' the teen asked, and the men said yes.

'My mom is coming to get me,' she said according to Schofield.

Darriean grew more upset, before insisting, 'I only took my eyes off the road for a second.'

Some bicyclists helped the injured while others vomited as they came upon the bloody scene.

Wells and Bouchard's spinal cords were crushed, their hearts and lungs lacerated.

Concern: Hess's fiance Scott Martin and sister Cassandra Clifton don't know if they can afford the bail

Driver: Hess was taken to Portsmouth Regional Hospital for treatment of minor injuries

Wells'
 windower, Tom Rogers, is following Darriean's case closely. He wants 
her to take a plea bargain, but he doesn't want her to go to prison.

'I would like to see her come out of this a better person,' he told the Globe.

'People say I'm being soft, but I'm not sure justice would be served (if she goes to jail).'

Yet, he doesn't want her to get off completely free.

'Her messed-up life has messed up my life and other families' lives, and now we're all damaged goods,' he said.

Darriean,
 who was driving without a license at the time of the crash, had her 
last court appearance in September 2013, and came on the same day police
 arrested a second woman who is accused of providing drugs to the 
wayward then-teen.

Cindy
 Sheppard allegedly supplied narcotics to Darriean at about 1.30 a.m. 
the morning of the crash and, at 8 a.m. that day let her drive a car 
even though she knew the teenager did not have a license.

The 48-year-old gave Darriean fentanyl, a painkiller much more potent than morphine.

Sheppard
 had been arrested on charges of selling heroin and cocaine last May but
 was out on bail when Darriean called her to pick her up after police 
pulled her over hours in the early hours.

Under
 New Hampshire law, no plea was entered on Darriean's behalf, but the 
court heard from a retired police major, who said he saw her driving so 
fast over the bridge he thought she was being chased.

As she went over the bridge she hit four cyclists, killing Wells and Bouchard, and injuring Margo Heigh and Uwe Uhmeyer.

She continued to drive a short distance, coming to a stop after crashing into the Welcome to Seabrook sign.

The
 19-year-old, who is engaged, had been stopped by police near the spot 
of the accident only a few hours before for driving without a license.

Gordon Wiley, who was friends 
with Bouchard, said after the hearing: 'She
 didn't have any conscience when she got back in the car [after being 
stopped earlier] and I didn't see any tears rolling out of her eyes when
 she was sitting there.'

He added that his wife was a close friend of Bouchard, and often cycled with her but had ducked out of doing the Granite State Wheelmen Tri-State Seacoast Century because she was new to the sport.

First time: Wells, pictured, was planning to ride 100 miles for the first time and had been working up toward it all summer

Darriean's
 family and lawyer said she was 'traumatized' by the accident and her 
sister initially said they didn't think they would be able to afford the
 bail.

Cassie Clifton, said: 'Everybody's devastated,' adding that her sister 'just wants to be close to her family'.

Hess
 has been accused of driving too fast for the road conditions and number
 of cyclists, when she crossed over a center line and hit the riders on a
 bridge, district attorney Jim Reams said.

Her victims had been taking part in the 40th annual Granite State Wheelmen Tri-State Seacoast Century ride.

The 19-year-old had been stopped on the same road eight hours before the crash and ticketed for driving without a license.

Hampton Police Chief James Sullivan said
 the officer in that stop followed policy when he issued her an 
appearance ticket then allowed a friend to pick her up and drive the car
 away.

'It's unfortunate that the incident happened the next day but the officer had no way of knowing that,' Sullivan said.

Reams would not say if the young woman's license had been suspended and
 said only that she did not currently have a New Hampshire driver's 
license.
