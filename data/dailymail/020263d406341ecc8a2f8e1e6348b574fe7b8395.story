The father of a man killed by the FBI in the investigation of Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev is suing the agency for $30million. 

Abdulbaki Todashev, father of then-27-year-old Ibragim Todashev, said he will file a notice of claim in the death of his son, who was shot by Special Agent Aaron McFarlane the night of May 21, 2013.

The claim will lead to a wrongful death lawsuit, and the elder Todashev is also alleging negligence by the FBI for hiring McFarlane, who had a checkered past.

The agent settled two police brutality lawsuits while at the Oakland Police Department and allegedly falsified reports before joining Boston's FBI, according to the Boston Globe.

Todashev is represented by the Council on American–Islamic Relations, who says that his son 'did not pose a threat of serious bodily harm to McFarlane or any other person' while being questioned about the Boston Bombings and a 2011 murder.

The Department of Justice and a Florida State Attorney’s Office have both cleared McFarlane of wrongdoing in the shooting at Ibragim Todashev's Orlando apartment.

Both official reports said that the agent acted in self-defense after being attacked by Todashev, a trained martial arts fighter.

The Russian immigrant, who lived in Massachusetts before moving to Florida, was reportedly writing a confession for involvement in the 2011 killing of three drug dealers in Waltham, a suburb of Boston, when he threw a coffee table and lunged at McFarlane with a broom.

FBI agent McFarlane and two Massachusetts state troopers were interrogating Todashev for six hours before he was shot. The Chechen Orlando resident had reportedly been writing a confession linked to a murder case

He was shot seven times in two bursts of fire, including once on the top of the head.

Abdulbaki Todashev, in Moscow, says that the agent killed his son 'in cold blood,' according to MSNBC. 

He has previously said that 'FBI bandits' had been behind the death. 

Two Massachusetts state troopers were also present and CAIR Florida  says that 'none of the agents present sought to intervene to prevent the excessive force, though able.'

Lawyers for the group also say that McFarlane allegedly falsified police reports and was misusing government money by working for the FBI while accepting disability payments from California.

Abdulbaki Todashev also alleges negligence in the FBI's hiring of McFarlane

A statement from the Todashev family, who buried Ibragim in Chechnya, Russia, said they want to 'draw public attention to the illegal practices, abuses of power, and civil rights violations by the FBI. 

FBI internal investigations cleared every officer in 150 shootings since 1993, according to a 2013 investigation by the New York Times.

CAIR also faults the agency for 'allowing of agents to conduct potentially charged interviews in people's homes'.

Ibragim Todashev was approached by FBI almost immediately following the Boston bombings, and had questioned him repeatedly and confiscated his electronic devices before the shooting. 

The six-hour Orlando interrogation occurred in the aftermath of the 2013 Boston bombings, where Todashev's friend Tamerlan Tsarnaev, then 26, is thought to have killed three and injured more than 200 with homemade explosives.

Tsarnaev, 26, was killed in the manhunt that followed the attack. 

His friend Todashev, who had trained at the same boxing gym as the attacker, told agents that the bombings were 'horrible and unnecessary,' according to the claim of notice.

The episode that led to his death happened after the man's girlfriend had been taken to an immigration detention center after allegedly refusing FBI agents' request to inform them of his activities. 

The claim of Abdulbaki Todahsev (left) against the FBI is being handled by the Council on American–Islamic Relations's Florida office, including CAIR Tampa executive director Hassan Shibly (center)

A witness Todashev had brought to his interrogation was allegedly sent away shortly before his friend was shot.

A spokesman for the Boston FBI told Daily Mail Online that the agency does not comment on pending litigation. 

The national FBI office also declined comment on the same grounds and referred to the Department of Justice and Florida reports on the incident.

Tsarnaev's younger brother Dzhokar, 19 at the time, is on trial for terrorism charges in connection with the Boston Bombings.

Opening statements in the case will begin later this week.
