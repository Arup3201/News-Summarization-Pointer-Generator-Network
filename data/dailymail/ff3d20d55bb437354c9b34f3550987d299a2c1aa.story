Tim Sherwood threw aside any reservations like a club-crested gilet as Aston Villa scored the goal that clinched their progress to the FA Cup quarter-finals.

Having allowed himself a smile when Leandro Bacuna’s wonderful strike flew in, he punched the air with all the glee of a lifelong Villa fan after Scott Sinclair’s tame effort somehow outfoxed Mark Schwarzer one minute from time.

Sherwood watched this tie from the stands as first team coach Scott Marshall took control in the dugout. But after a goalless opening period, Villa’s 11th consecutive first half without scoring, the new manager was in the dressing room at the interval to address certain issues. From the outside, his words seemed to have had an immediate impact.

Villa beat Leicester by raising their attacking fluency in the second half and despite Andrej Kramaric’s consolation in stoppage time, a loud roar greeted the final whistle. Heaven knows these supporters, long-starved of much to shout about, would embrace a trip to Wembley, now just one win away.

Premier League survival is the prime concern, of course, but there were signs of encouragement here, too. Paul Lambert was sacked and Sherwood installed because Villa desperately required a change to shake this underperforming squad into life and out of the relegation zone.

The bounce hoped for by Sherwood’s arrival has got off to a springy start.

‘Tim came in the dressing room before the game briefly, introduced himself and wished the boys the best,’ said Marshall. ‘He came in at half time and made a couple of points to everyone about things he had spotted. There was a lot of individual detail there, it was not one big sweeping statement.

‘I put across my points about the game, what I thought and what I saw, and he had an input after that. He brought some good info to the group, good football knowledge that comes with experience and a lifetime in the game.’

Sherwood, who watched this match sitting between chief executive Tom Fox and head of recruitment Paddy Reilly, will convey those ideas at his first press conference as Villa boss on Monday before turning his attention to the visit of Stoke City on Saturday.

For his opposite number, this was another bad Sunday. Seven days ago Nigel Pearson was sacked then reinstated as Leicester manager. Here, the club’s fans requested he ‘sort it out’ and also decried the performance as a ‘load of rubbish’ during the closing stages.

Pearson explained the decision to stick with five at the back against English football’s worst attack because Villa play narrow and the system might come in useful as Leicester fight to stay in the top flight.

Trialled first in the defeat at Arsenal, it seemed unnecessary against a Villa side that had scored 15 goals in all competitions this season prior to kick-off. But three minutes after Pearson replaced Marcin Wasilewski with Leo Ulloa to go to 4-4-2, Villa took the lead.

In the 68th minute Ron Vlaar, recalled for his first match since injuring his knee at Crystal Palace on New Year’s Day, found Bacuna on the left flank. The Dutch winger cut inside Danny Simpson and unleashed a shot that flew into the far corner.

Christian Benteke was also recalled by Marshall but he wasted his one big chance by blazing over the bar in the 72nd minute when put clean through.

Villa’s second goal did come with a minute left on the clock. Benteke lofted a ball to Sinclair, who wriggled around Simpson and just about hit a shot on target. But Schwarzer should have done much better than blocking with one hand before fumbling the ball in with the other.

Leicester had shaded the first-half chances but only beat the excellent Shay Given in stoppage time — Kramaric scoring past the Irish keeper with a firm header.

It was all too late for Leicester fans who had voiced their concern. ‘People are entitled to their opinion,’ said Pearson, whose side go to Everton on Sunday. ‘What we have to do is find a way of being consistent during a game and then game-to-game. We need mental resilience, absolutely.’

Just the kind of thing Villa have recruited Sherwood to provide.
