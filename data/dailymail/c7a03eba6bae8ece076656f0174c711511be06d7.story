Kalashnikov-wielding robbers ambushed the motorcade of a Saudi prince in Paris last night reportedly  making off with 250,000 euros (£200,000) in cash and a bundle of 'sensitive' diplomatic documents.

The theft took place around Porte de la Chapelle, in northern Paris, as the motorcade was making its way from the Saudi embassy to an airport in Le Bourget, said police.

Guns were flashed but no shots fired in the dramatic raid by up to eight assailants, the Paris prosecutor's office said. No injuries or arrests were reported.

A nationwide manhunt has now been launched in a bid to track the assailants who police said somehow possessed 'detailed information' about the prince's itinerary and route.

Hold up: The prince, who has not been named, had been at the Saudi embassy in Paris

Rocco Contento, of the SGP Paris 
police union, said that the car had 250,000 euro (£200,000) in cash and 
official embassy documents, and that the assailants were well-informed 
about the itinerary of the vehicle.

The Paris prosecutor's office the car carried "things of value", but would not confirm the theft of cash or documents.

The
 Mercedes car, with a driver and two passengers, was heading for the 
city's Le Bourget airport to handle paperwork for the departing prince, 
according to the prosecutor's office.

Drama: The car attacked was a supply vehicle that was stolen and later found burned elsewhere in Paris

Le Bourget is often used for high-level visitors taking private jets to Paris.

French officials refused to name the prince, who has since left the country for an unidentified destination.

The
 burned shell of the stolen car was later found near the attack site in 
northern Paris along with another car, apparently belonging to the 
assailants, according to the prosecutor's office.

The Saudi Embassy could not be reached for comment.

The
 French foreign ministry called the attack, coming at the height of 
tourist season in the French capital, 'unacceptable'. An investigation 
was opened for armed robbery in an organised gang.
