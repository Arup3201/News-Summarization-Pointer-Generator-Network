An Australian filmmaker has made a hilarious video of people having a crack at the classic catchphrase of his homeland: 'G'day mate, how you going?' - the video's namesake.  

Most of the people Kieran Murray, from Brisbane in Queensland, engages in conversation do not understand what he is saying, with one dry cleaner in Vancouver asking 'What language is that?'

Other attempts include one girl in Austin, Texas repeating the catchphrase as 'Cheddar may hey hoe' and a man in Los Angeles who says 'Jenny Armani Young' after Murray, 24, says 'G'day mate, how you going?' in a broad Australian accent.

Brisbane's Kieran Murray, 24, has made a video documenting foreigners' reactions to the Australian catchphrase: 'G'day mate! How you going?'

Murray started his project after he walked the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival in France (right). He travelled in nine countries, including the Netherlands (right), over six months

A Texan man's reaction to being asked the question is just staring blankly into the camera.

The video, which is uploaded on Murray's YouTube channel, has so far attracted almost 30,000 views.

Murray, who now lives in Los Angeles in the United States, collected the footage over six months while travelling to nine different countries.

The countries included in the almost three-minute video include France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, the U.S. and Canada

The reactions range from confusion like this dry cleaner in Vancouver who asks what language he is speaking

This Texan man's reaction to the question was just staring into the camera blankly as Murray tried to contain his laughter

He kicked off his trip around the world in France when his short film, The F Word, was selected for the Short Film Corner at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival.

'From here on I travelled through Europe and met a lot of people who were fascinated with the Australian accent,' Murray told Daily Mail Australia.

'I got a brainwave to start filming people as they attempted to mimic the popular Australian catchphrase and the results were hilarious.'

Murray said the element of surprise was how he got his hilarious results.

'I found that I could get the best reaction from people if I filmed them with no knowledge of what I was going to ask them to say,' he said. 

He also travelled to the United States. He is pictured here at Chicago's Willis Tower skydeck

Murray said the element of surprise was his best tool as he got better reactions out of people

The filmmaker now lives in Los Angeles but is originally from Brisbane, Queensland
