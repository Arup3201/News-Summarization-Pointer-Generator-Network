A training program designed to test a woman's compatibility as an office secretary in 1959 has been unearthed by The National Archives Text Message blog.

The 25-point list, which was compiled for an unknown company in Waco, Texas, reveals the skills you'd need to fit right in to 'the business world' as a woman in mid-century America.

'Is my voice pleasing and well modulated?' is among one of the more amusing requirements. 'When people bore me, do I conceal it?'

Perfect poise: A 25-point checklist, unearthed from the National Archives, reveals what it takes to be a secretary in 1959, and some of the requirements are somewhat hilarious

And although it would be entirely unacceptable to print some of these phrases on a job application in this day and age, it goes without saying that some of these sentiments will still serve you well today.

'Do I control my impulse to meddle in other people's business?' it asks, 'Do I avoid gossiping?'

Some self-evaluational questions come off as a little more controversial to the modern eye. If you happen to be intelligent, or possess a mind of your own, for example, you'd better not show it.

'Do I refrain from showing off how much I know?' it begs. 'Do I refrain from talking about myself?'

The list in full: A score of 80 per cent reveals a 'good personality rating for the business world', and falling short of this requires you to 'work towards personal improvement'

And, reasonably enough, the list certainly seems to be eking out any sort of cattiness in the workplace.

'Do I avoid making fun of others behind their back?' it asks. 'Do I refrain from making sarcastic remarks?'

Many of the requirements on the list compare easily to the current job description for a secretary on totaljobs.com.

Am I always on the alert to improve my vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar?

The 1959 list poses the questions: 'Do I smile readily and naturally?’ and ‘ Can I talk to the boss as easily as to the office boy?'

Totaljobs.com suggests an applicant should be 'Friendly and polite (manners cost nothing after all)', 'Discrete' and the owner of 'A bright and positive attitude.'

Having said that, no job description today would stretch as far as: 'Am I always on the alert to improve my vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar?'

And if you assumed, with the advance of technology, that secretaries were now a dying breed - think again.

According to the 2010 U.S. Census, the most common job for a woman in today's America is - drum roll - a secretary, followed by a cashier, a teacher and then a nurse. And of the four million secretaries employed in 2010; only 4 per cent of them were men.

Not a dying breed: According to the 2010 U.S. Census, the most common job for a woman in today's world is still a secretary, and this shows no sign of changing

Additionally, according to the Labor Department projections, it's a category that is on the up, and set to grow 12 per cent between 2010 and 2020.

Ray Weikal, spokesman for the International Association of Administrative Professionals told CNN Money last year: '[Historically] Every time a major new technology showed up, there were always predictions that this would spell the end of secretaries.

'You saw that with the development of electric typewriters, the personal computer and the internet, but every time technology gets more efficient...You continue to need people who can use those tools.'

Perhaps in the future, we will look back on today's job descriptions and chortle; but in any case it would seem, long live the secretary.
