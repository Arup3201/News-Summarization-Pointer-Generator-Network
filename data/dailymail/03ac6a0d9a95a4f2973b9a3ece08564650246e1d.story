Activists have hit out at Beyonce for 'supporting' animal cruelty after the superstar posed for a picture with a baby tiger while travelling with husband Jay Z and daughter Blue Ivy.

The Drunk In Love singer has been sharing holiday snaps of her family's trip around Southeast Asia in recent days, but she has come under fire for riding an elephant and appearing in an image featuring a tiger being fed by a bottle.

World Animal Protection's Dr Jan Schmidt-Burbach said tigers used for these photos are often crammed into tiny cages or chained to the floor for long periods.

Animal activists have hit out at Beyonce after the superstar and her family posed for a photo with a baby tiger

Intrepid Travel slammed Beyonce on Twitter after she was pictured riding on an elephant in late December

'Their health and well-being should not be sacrificed for a photo opportunity,' Dr Schmidt-Burbach said.

'When you look behind the scenes, holiday snaps like these support an industry that relies on animal cruelty.'

Dr Schmidt-Burbach added that tigers are forcibly removed from their mothers to be fed artificially by tourists. 

'All in all a far cry from their natural lives in the wild. But this sordid side of tourism is conveniently hidden from public view,' he said.

This comes after tourism company Intrepid Travel slammed Beyonce on Twitter after she was pictured riding on an elephant in late December.

'Hi @Beyonce! We don't want to ruin your vacay, but elephant rides are not fun for elephants,' the company tweeted, and linked out to a blog post.

In the post Intrepid outlined its decision to stop offering elephant rides on any of its holidays.

'People often think that an elephant in captivity is domesticated, and so somehow it's OK to have them under human command,' the company wrote.

'But the reality is that [elephants] never have been domesticated like dogs or horses. Even if born in captivity, they are still a wild animal, and need to be "broken" to accept human control.

'There is much evidence that this process is exceptionally cruel.'

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Beyonce for comment.

Beyonce, 33, can be seen reaching over to stroke the cub while wearing a blue and gold outfit with an ornate bejeweled crown on her head.

Meanwhile, rap mogul Jay Z looks slightly out of place in the image, watching from the sidelines in a trucker cap and casual tee.

The A-list family have splurged on two lavish holidays in the past month - first to Iceland to mark the 99 Problems rapper's 45th birthday, then to Southeast Asia where they have so far visited Thailand and Cambodia.

According to the New York Post, the pair were staying in a $25,000-a-night, $35 million villa at the Amanpuri resort in Phuket.

Sources also said Beyonce and Jay Z were spotted riding around the streets on a motorcycle.

The trio have now arrived in neighbouring Cambodia, where Beyonce has been keeping her 22.9 million Instagram followers updated with snapshots from their travels.

She shared pictures of majestic temples, lush green fields and monks gazing back at her.

Queen Bey also posted a picture of herself in local dress, standing outside a beautiful temple.
