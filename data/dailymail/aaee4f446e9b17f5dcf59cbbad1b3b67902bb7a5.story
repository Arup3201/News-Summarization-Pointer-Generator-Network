A professional rugby player is facing disciplinary action by his club after posting a derogatory tweet about double Olympic gold medallist Mo Farah.

Hooker Brett Sharman appeared to question the nationality of the Team GB runner on August 11, the day Farah won his second gold medal in the 5,000m.

According to the BBC, which claims to have seen the post, the message said: 'Good luck Mohammed running for Paki... I mean Great Britain...’.

The 25-year-old South African apologised the following day and has since deleted his account.

A Saints spokesman did not reveal details of any action taken, but told the BBC that it treated 'all such matters seriously'.

He added: ‘The club has a clear policy regarding social media and is following the procedures set out in that policy.

‘Northampton Saints does not comment on individual cases.’

Farah, who was born in Somalia and moved to Britain when he was eight to escape the country's civil war, has become a worldwide celebrity since his triumphs in the 10,000m and then the 5,000m.

Sharman joined the Premiership club four years ago and has established himself as a regular, filling in for England’s Dylan Hartley when the captain is on international duty.

According to the Guardian, Sharman is qualified to play for England despite being born in South Africa.

The Saints director of rugby, Jim Mallinder, said the hooker holds a British passport and has ambitions to represent England.
