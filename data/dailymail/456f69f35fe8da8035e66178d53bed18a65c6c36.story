A 6-year-old girl has reportedly been abducted

A young girl who was reportedly abducted from outside a Brisbane school has been found 'safe and well'.

It comes after the 6-year-old was last seen at Ascot State School on the corner of Anthony and Massey streets, Ascot in Brisbane about 1.30pm on Monday.

Police have released an official statement to thank the media and public for their assistance.

'For privacy reasons, no further information is available at this time,' the statement said. 

The girl is described as being of a slim build with a fair complexion and with shoulder-length blonde hair with a red and blue bow and blue eyes.

She was wearing a dark blue button- up school shirt that has a red and yellow stripe in it and blue shorts, red socks and one black shoe.

A Queensland police spokeswoman  confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that the adult involved was known to the girl, who was not named at the request of the family.

'We can confirm that it is not a stranger,' she said. 

Police  released an abduction alert on Monday night, saying the girl 'may be at risk'.

Nearly 30,000 people shared a bright yellow flyer around on Facebook after police appealed for public assistance.

Nearby resident Kathy Reade told The Courier Mail the news came as a shock and has left her feeling 'rattled'.

'I didn't see anything, I didn't hear anything,' she said.

'It's worrying, especially around this area.'
