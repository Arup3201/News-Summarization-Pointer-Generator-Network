Fish soup with tofu and rice, stir-fried pork with vegetables and baked chicken with stuffed grape leaves... these are just some of the exotic lunches school children from around the world tuck into. 

The widely different meals from Spain, Ukraine, Greece, South Korea, Brazil, France, Finland and Italy are all fresh and wholesome, with fish, steak and vegetables featuring prominently.

But in stark contrast, the UK and US lunch trays feature processed foods such as popcorn chicken, frankfurters, cookies, and beans from a tin.

The school lunch comparisons were revealed by Sweetgreen, a chain of US restaurants, and website Never Seconds, run by Scottish schoolgirl Martha Payne, who logs her thoughts and experiences of eating school meals at her primary school in Lochgilphead, Scotland. 

The 12-year-old launched the blog in 2012 as a school writing project with assistance from her father, David, 

Written under the pseudonym 'VEG' (Veritas Ex Gustu – truth from tasting), with the subtitle 'One primary school pupil's daily dose of school dinners', the blog features daily entries on the £2 school meal that Martha/ 'VEG' has chosen that day, her thoughts on the food and its quality, a count of the number of hairs, a health rating, a picture, and marks out of 10 based on a 'Food-o-Meter'.

Martha, who has been invited to talk in international conferences is currently raising money for Scottish charity Mary's Meals, through her JustGiving page. 

Mary's Meals  - which began in 2002 as a one-off school feeding programme - currently provides daily life changing meals to over 989,000 hungry children in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Eastern Europe and South America.

The surprising pictures show just how the UK and US measures up to the rest of the world when it comes to feeding schoolchildren. 

While the majority of lunches feature fresh foods, US tray is packed with processed items. 

Similarly the typical UK school lunch is sadly lacking in fresh vegetables, featuring a baked potato, sausage and beans from a tin, and a half corn on the cob with a melon slice to follow.

Lunch in an Estonian school is rice with a piece of meat and purple cabbage. They also have bread and a get a cup of chocolate drink

Lorna Driver-Davies, a nutritional therapist at NutriCentre said to FEMAIL: 'Looking at the lunches from across the world, it seems mixed in terms of how balanced the diets are. Looks can be deceiving, since while the Finnish lunch looks very healthy - the focus is on starchy carbohydrates, starchy vegetables and fruit. So for me it's lacking in adequate protein or green leafy vegetables.

Ms Driver-Davis thinks the schoolchildren in France, Korea and Brazil have the best lunches. 

'My favourite is the Korean meal since fermented foods are great for gut health and the children are given a starchy carbohydrate such as rice, but also green and colourful vegetables and fish – boosting protein levels,' she said. 

'The French meal was also very good since they are leaning towards giving vegetables and meat rather than too much bread or pasta and the French cheese will give some protein, fat soluble nutrients and calcium. 

'The Brazilian meal was as good as the Korean, since there is an emphasis on meat and plant proteins and vegetables. We still focus on starchy carbohydrates to fill us up but children cannot have a nutritionally balanced diet without adequate good fats, proteins and a wide and large variety of vegetables. 

'The Cuban food looked a little devoid of vegetables. Greece and Spain also looked good - although Spain could have had more vegetables.' 

Balanced diet: Italian children get pasta, fish, two kinds of salad, rocket and caprese, a bread roll and grapes 

In Finland lunch is mainly a vegetarian affair of pea soup, carrots, beetroot salad, crusty roll and sweet pancake with berries to finish

But she wasn't impressed with the UK or US school dinners.  

'The healthier UK meal trumped the other UK meal comparison. The less healthy option gave the children very cheap looking sausages, a potato, watermelon and a corn on the cob. So quite low in good quality protein and almost non-existent vegetables. 

The US meal was very carbohydrate dense,' she continued. 

In France, children start their meal with a generous slab of Brie. 

This is followed by a hearty portion of rare steak, served with two types of vegetables - carrots and green beans. 

And you won't find sweets on this lunch tray. The healthy theme continues into dessert, with the young ones  tucking into kiwi fruit and apples.

A meal of traditional flavours: Brazil's rice and black beans, baked plantain, pork with peppers and coriander, green salad and a seeded roll

The South Korean lunch is equally as impressive. 

A milky fish soup to start followed by a serving of stir fried rice with tofu, broccoli and peppers. On the side is kimchi, the traditional Korean condiment of fermented cabbage.

In Scandinavia, Finnish schools dish up a vegetarian lunch of pea soup, beetroot salad, carrots and a roll. For pudding there is pannakkau, a sweet pancake served with strawberries and blueberries. 

Rice, a chicken croquette, a piece of taro root and yellow pea soup is the school lunch in Old Havana, Cuba

In Japan, school children tuck into fried fish, dried seaweed, tomatoes, miso soup with potatoes, rice (in the metal container), and milk

A plump portion of lightly fried fish sits atop rocket salad in the Italian lunch tray. This is accompanied by a small portion of pasta, a simple caprese salad of tomatoes, mozzarella and basil, a crusy roll and a bunch of grapes. 

Most of the schools have kept to traditional foods for the school lunch. 

Children in Spain start their meal with cold tomato soup, gazpacho, served with shrimp and brown rice. This is served with a seeded roll, peppers with red cabbage and half an orange for dessert. 

Children in Greece have baked chicken with orzo, stuffed grape leave, cucumber and tomato salad, yoghurt with pomegranate seeds and oranges. 

Wholesome: Seeded roll, shrimp with brown rice, gazpacho and tri-colour peppers. Dessert is half an orange

A serving of borscht (beetroot soup) with pickled cabbage, sausages and mash. Dessert is a sweet pancake

Traditional South American food such as rice with black beans, baked plantains and pork with vegetables are on offer for Brazilian children. They also had a side serving of salad and bread with their meal.

In Ukraine children feast on mashed potato, sausages, borscht, cabbage and syrniki, a type of dessert pancake.

US school lunches feature fried popcorn chicken with ketchup, mashed potatoes, peas, a fruit cup and a chocolate chip cookie.

Bowls of salad are ready to be served at Delcare Edu Center, a local kindergarten and child care center in the business district of Singapore

In France, school lunch is an art form: hot, multi-course and involving vegetables. A meal of rice, salmon, ratatouille, a slice of bread, a salad with celery and carrots, and an orange and donut at the Anne Franck school in Lambersart, northern France
