Three days earlier, he sat stern-faced through the Coalition’s latest ‘we’re all in it together’ Budget.

But with a flatlining economy and the  row raging over benefits cuts, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg knew exactly where he needed to be – at his family’s £7million, 20-room, Swiss ski chalet.

Leaving the stress of austerity Britain behind, he jetted out with his family for an Easter getaway at the luxury villa nestling between fashionable Klosters and the resort of Davos.

Luxury: Clegg's family ski chalet had 20 rooms and is worth £7million. The Deputy PM has been skiing there since infancy

His family’s retreat – which comes complete with its own chef – has a large wooden balcony for sunbathing and magnificent views through the pine trees towards Lake Davos.

Mr Clegg, 46, is enjoying his second holiday there this year with his wife, commercial lawyer Miriam Gonzalez Durantez, the daughter of a Spanish senator, and their three young sons.

They flew out last Saturday and were enjoying the millionaires’ playground – a favourite of the Royal Family – days before the benefits cuts, which are due to come into force on Monday.

The Deputy PM’s chalet – which would cost around £10,000 a week if it was available to rent – has been owned by his Dutch mother Hermance and her relatives for decades, and he has been skiing there since infancy.

Regular: Clegg described his favourite ski morning which involved a 'huge, fattening, vein-blocking breakfast' then a lot of long runs from the top of the slopes

It was built by his maternal grandfather, who loved the area so much he became a Swiss citizen.

Mr Clegg has previously recalled: ‘The family would go there every year. It was bucolic – we would walk over to the nearby farm and get fresh milk from the cows every morning for breakfast.’ 

Describing his perfect start to a ski day, he said in an interview with Ski and Snowboard magazine: ‘Up early, then a huge, fattening, vein-blocking breakfast, full of cheese and potatoes, like a rosti, washed down with a large hot chocolate. Then a lot of long runs, right from the very top all the way down.’ 

The chalet is one of his favourite bolt-holes to escape the pressures of political life. He said: ‘If there’s a hard moment in my work, I often think about my favourite places on the mountains. It’s very calming.’ This week, Mr Clegg was seen on the slopes in a Dainese designer helmet, Killy ski gloves and a trendy Patagonia jacket in ‘Lib Dem orange’.

He was spotted gallantly carrying both his and his wife’s skis, balancing them on his shoulders like a pair of hunting rifles.

On Thursday, on the way back to his villa, he stopped his people carrier and wound down his window when he saw some photographers, and asked: ‘Are you looking for me?’ Then he drove off.

Vacation: This is Clegg's second holiday this year with his family, including wife Miriam

He had earlier driven to the Jakobshorn mountain, where the family took a cable car up to the 8,000ft peak. 

They spent three-and-a-half hours enjoying the slopes, rubbing shoulders with the super-rich. The warm weather saw many of his fellow skiers abandon the snow to sunbathe at mountaintop restaurants, where lunchtime bottles of wine sell for £70.

One skier told Mr Clegg outside a restaurant that he was a fan of his and thought that he was doing a good job. Mr Clegg replied: ‘It’s very difficult at times.’ 

It is Mr Clegg’s second skiing holiday this year. His family also spent several days at the chalet in February. He has previously described himself as a ‘ski bum’ because he loves spending so much time on the slopes.

A visit there in 2011 was embroiled in controversy when Mr Clegg admitted he ‘forgot’ he was supposed to be running the country in the absence of the PM.

As well as the Swiss hideaway, Mr  Clegg, who is estimated to be worth £1.9million, also uses his father’s chateau in Bordeaux.
