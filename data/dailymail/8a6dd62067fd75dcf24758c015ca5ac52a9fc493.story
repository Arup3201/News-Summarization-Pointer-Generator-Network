Movies based on the Bible have always caused conundrums for directors as they balance creating a thrilling spectacle with sensitive issues of belief. 

The latest director to face this problem is Ridley Scott with his Biblical epic, Exodus: Gods and Kings, which opens in American theaters on December 12.

Scott has opted to cast an 11-year-old British schoolboy, Isaac Andrews, to depict God through the character of a young boy Malak.

Isaac Andrews, aged 11 and from the UK, was chosen by Ridley Scott to depict God in his new movie Exodus: Gods and Kings

The director told The Hollywood Reporter: 'Sacred texts give no specific depiction of God, so for centuries artists and filmmakers have had to choose their own visual depiction.

'Malak exudes innocence and purity, and those two qualities are extremely powerful.'

The boy appears in the film when Moses is at the 'burning bush' and then later to guide the prophet who realizes that God is channeling through the child.

The starring role in a multi-million dollar movie is far from Isaac's first big break. The 11-year-old's resume already includes roles in movies Hercules, Blackwood and British rom-com Having You.

Scott's choice will likely add to the controversy surrounding the film, a month ahead of its release date.

The film tells the story of Moses rising up in defiance against the Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses, setting 600,000 slaves on a journey of escape amid a series of plagues.

Christian Bale, who plays Moses, caused upset last month after he described his character as 'barbaric' and 'schizophrenic' at a press conference.

Speaking  in Los Angeles, Bale said he had undertaken significant research for the role in the Biblical epic, reading the Torah, the Koran and Jonathan Kirsch’s life of Moses.

The actor said: ‘I think the man was likely schizophrenic and was one of the most barbaric individuals that I ever read about in my life.'

Bale also said he was surprised by the complexity of the Old Testament figure – and his creator.

Isaac is already a star having had roles in Hercules and this British rom-com Having You 

‘He was a very troubled, tumultuous man and mercurial. But the biggest surprise was the nature of God. He was equally very mercurial,’ he said. 

Bale’s controversial comments haven't been well received by Christian writers  who fear the film is tampering too much with the original Biblical text.

Influential Christian blogger, Brian Godawa, weighed in on Bale’s comments on his blog.

Godawa wrote: 'Yes, Moses murdered a man, and he had a character arc that went from being adopted and raised as a pagan Egyptian to a conversion to his troubled and tumultuous faith. 

'He had difficulty trusting Yahweh. He didn’t want to be God’s spokesman because he stuttered. And he even had arguments with God.

'But Schizophrenic? Barbaric? Really?'

Godawa said that he hoped Bale's comment was ‘a reflection of the actor’s own ignorant bigotry than of the actual movie'. 

Exodus: Gods and Kings was filmed at Pinewood studios in the UK along with locations in the Canary Islands and Andalucia, Spain.

The movie is one of two big-budget Biblical movies to be released in coming months along with Noah, directed by Darren Aronofsky and starring Russell Crowe.
