The former Prime Minister claims that his ‘commitments in the Middle East and elsewhere’ mean that it will be ‘challenging’ for him to give face-to-face evidence to MPs about the letters

Tony Blair has repeatedly attempted to duck out of an inquiry into the ‘comfort letters’ sent to IRA fugitives by claiming that his ‘commitments’ will make an appearance ‘challenging’.

The Northern Ireland affairs committee has spent more than six months attempting to question Mr Blair over secret deals that he made with Sinn Fein.

In the negotiations struck with the party, Mr Blair made promises to more than 200 people suspected of paramilitary offences that they would not face prosecution.

But in correspondence seen by The Times newspaper, the former Prime Minister claims that his ‘commitments in the Middle East and elsewhere’ mean that it will be ‘challenging’ for him to give face-to-face evidence to MPs about the letters.

He also added that he had nothing ‘new’ to say.

In a letter sent last month, he wrote that he had ‘nothing to say which will be new to you, the members of your committee or the people of Northern Ireland.’

The former Prime Minister also noted that he had already given evidence in private to the Hallett Review.

He added that, if he came before a public inquiry his evidence would be even more scant.

The letter reads: ‘Giving information in public means that I would have rather less to say.’

The review was commissioned by David Cameron following the collapse of a trial involving a suspect in a bombing carried out by the IRA in Hyde Park in 1982.

The assurance letters came to light during the trial of John Downey - accused of murdering four soldiers in the attack.

During the case, it emerged that Mr Downey had been given a letter assuring him that he would not face prosecution.

A three-month inquiry into the ‘comfort letters’, led by Lady Justice Hallett, concluded that the scheme was not unlawful.

Instead, she said that there had been cases where ‘not wanted’ notices were issued to the wrong parties.

But MPs say that their investigation would be more open than the Hallett inquiry, as no transcripts were published following the initial investigation.

Laurence Robertson, the Conservative chairman of the Northern Ireland affairs committee, told The Times: ‘We don’t know what he said to the Hallett inquiry,’ he said. ‘We haven’t had a chance to question him on any of the issues.’

Mr Blair concluded his letter by saying: ‘However, if you continue to insist on my attendance, then I will ask my office to look for a date in the new year, but I must emphasise that my commitments... will make this challenging.’

The committee has already said that they would accept video evidence from Mr Blair instead of a personal appearance.

A spokeswoman for Mr Blair told The Times last night: ‘We are considering all the options proposed by the committee, given that they have refused to accept the offer of written evidence.

‘It should be noted that Mr Blair has already given evidence to the government’s inquiry led by Lady Justice Hallett and his commitment and respect for the people of Northern Ireland remains undiminished. We will respond to the committee shortly.’
