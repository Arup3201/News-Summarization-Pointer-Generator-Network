Suspended: Roger Bainton allegedly botched up 26 per cent of his experimental face surgery operations

A surgeon suspended over 88 alleged botched operations has blamed his failure on patients smoking, drinking and taking drugs.

Roger Bainton was struck off the dental register and suspended by the General Medical Council over a death in Scotland in 1999.

But he relocated to Stoke-on-Trent where he continued practising - and a shocking 26 per cent of his patients suffered surgical complications.

In an extraordinary attempt to defend his errors, the disgraced surgeon claimed the victims' lifestyle was to blame.

He also said patients in The Potteries, Stoke-on-Trent, have a 'weaker genetic make up', leading to further surgery mix-ups, a Royal College of Surgeons report reveals.

The document states Mr Bainton - who rebuilds the faces of assault or 
accident victims - used an unproven and experimental bone substitute 
without personally telling 33 of his 123 patients.

He started implanting the material into the eye sockets of the patients 
at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire in 2007.

The technique had only previously been used on non-facial bones.

But it was stopped in 2012 after colleagues blew the whistle and reported their concerns.

Finally, in February 2013, Mr Bainton was suspended and the RCS was called to carry out an internal review.

It said Mr
 Bainton blamed his 26 per cent failure rate on 'a high incidence of drinkers, smokers and drug 
addicts' in North Staffordshire.

The report authors added: 'He tended to rationalise 
poor patient outcomes and repeated procedures as being the result of the
 patient's own lifestyle.

Mr Bainton was suspended from University Hospital of North Staffordshire in February 2013

'There is now a legacy of patients who have had
 unproven surgical techniques applied to their care without adequate 
consent and who will likely require long-term follow-ups.'

Karen Reynolds, of Freeth Cartwright 
LLP, who is representing 30 of Mr Bainton's patients, said: 'The RCS 
report indicates significant failings, not only in Mr Bainton's 
practice, but within the maxillofacial department and the hospital trust
 itself.'

The report also reveals:

Hospital leaders and the oral and maxillofacial department where Mr Bainton worked were condemned in the report.

It found 'no strong clinical leadership' which allowed the surgeons to run services without question and left them operating independently.

Today, hospital officials reiterated their apologies to patients who may have been harmed during or following facial surgery.

They accepted the RCS findings that Mr Bainton had carried out 'unproven' techniques or had used surgical procedures unnecessarily

Thirty-three of the 88 patients were recalled after being treated with the experimental bone substitute by Mr Bainton.

A further 36 patients had jaw surgery when non-surgical measures would normally be adopted.

The final 19 patients could have had eye socket surgery needlessly.

Medical Director Robert Courteney-Harris said: 'We drew up a comprehensive action plan in response to each of the RCS's recommendations and completed the key actions some 12 months ago.

'Other, longer term actions, such as the appointment of a new oral and maxillofacial consultant with an interest in trauma, were finalised earlier this year. The appointee took up his post in March.

'We have been committed from the outset to being open and transparent with our patients, regulatory bodies and commissioners.

'Our first and last priority is to ensure our patients are able to have full confidence in the quality of care and treatment they receive from us and that any departure from these high standards is thoroughly investigated and acted upon.'

Mr Bainton was unavailable for comment.
