A frantic search is under way for a 53-year-old Colorado man who vanished without a trace during a football game in Denver last week.

Paul Kitterman, from Kremmling, has not been seen or heard from since Thursday, when he disappeared at halftime while attending a Denver Broncos game with his son and a pair of friends.

'We were looking everywhere in parking lots, trees, bushes, anywhere we could think of,' Paul's son, Jarod Tonneson, said Sunday.

Worried sick: Jarod Tonneson has spent the past four days giving out fliers in a desperate bid to locate his missing father

The missing man's family and loved ones have spent the last four days handing out fliers and plastering posters around the stadium hoping to locate him.

'I just can't help but think something bad's happened,' Tonneson told KDVR.

A spokesperson for the Denver Police Department told MailOnline Monday morning that Kitterman's disappearance remains an active missing persons case, but they do not have any leads and they do not suspect foul play at this time.

Paul Kitterman was in the stands with his son during the first half of the Denver Broncos game against the San Diego Chargers Thursday night.

Jarod left his 53-year-old father at halftime and didn't see him again after he arrived back at their bleacher seats.

When the game ended and his father was nowhere to be seen, Jarod began to worry that he had disappeared. 

9 News reported that Tia Bakke and her boyfriend had invited Paul and Jarod to see what would be their first Broncos game.

'Paul and Jarod had never been to a game so we got some extra tickets,' said Bakke, who drove down to Denver with the two from Kremmling, about two hours away.

The father and son were seated in bleachers away from Bakke, but met up during the halftime intermission. When they separated again, Paul told Bakke he'd see her after the game.

Missing: A friend of Kitterman said that it was uncharacteristic of him to disappear and leave his son and family worrying about him

That was the last anyone has seen of him. His son Jarod was in the restroom during halftime and said that he returned to his seat but that his father never did.

Paul's friends and his son scoured Mile High stadium after the game, speaking to staff and police, and phoned the area jails and hospitals without getting any clues as to what happened to Paul.

According to Bakke, Paul is 'not a technology guy' and was carrying only $50 in cash, without any credit cards, cellphone or a car.

Though a missing persons report has been filed, so far there has been no trace of Paul.

'He's absolutely nowhere to be found,' Bakke said. 'It's been the longest, [most] miserable three days of our lives.'

There were no known medical problems or drug use in Paul's past that would lead him to disappear suddenly, said Bakke.

'This is just so not characteristic of Paul,' she said. 'Paul is one of the most loyal, responsible people you'll ever meet in your life. He would never, ever just leave you hanging, and especially his son. He would never leave Jarod.'

Denver police told KDVR Sunday they did not suspect any foul play to be involved with Paul's disappearance.

Tia Bakke's boyfriend, Jay Ust, said that nothing out of the ordinary happened before or during the first half of the game, and that Kitterman seemed in good spirits.

'Nothing adds up,' Ust added.

The 53-year-old father was said to be 'totally out of his element' in the big city.

Paul Kitterman is described as a white male, 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighing 190lbs, with brown hair and hazel eyes. 

He was last seen wearing a dark hooded sweatshirt and a Broncos baseball cap. 

Anyone with information on Kitterman’s whereabouts is being asked to call Denver Police at 720-913-2000
