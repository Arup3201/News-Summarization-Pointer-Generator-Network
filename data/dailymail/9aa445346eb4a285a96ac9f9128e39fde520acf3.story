Calls for 'busty lab workers', 'sexy nuns' and actresses who are 'slim with teardrop breasts' might sound distinctly 1970s in tone but, incredibly, they don't come from vintage ads.

Instead they're just some of the sexist requests that flood casting sites every day, according to the actress behind a blog named Casting Call Woe.

Speaking to the Telegraph, the blogger, who has chosen to remain anonymous and goes by the moniker 'Miss L', revealed that the seedy side of acting is still with us and shows no sign of going away.

Not so glamorous: The star-studded face of film, theatre and TV conceals a grubby truth

Woe no: Miss L's blog, Casting Call Woe, charts some of the more ridiculous casting messages

In an interview with the paper, she explained that her blog is 'a way of letting the world know about these casting calls and a way of showing the world a side of the industry that it doesn’t generally see.'

And Miss L isn't the only actress to speak out about sexist behaviour in the world of TV, theatre and film.

Speaking at the Empire Film Awards last year, Dame Helen Mirren used a 30-second appearance to lambast the industry and lament the lack of female directors.

As she presented Sam Mendes with an award, the actress said: 'Now I just want to say quickly, it was great to hear Sam Mendes's little list of moments that inspired him.

Outspoken:  Both Helen Mirren and Thandie Newton have spoken out about sexism in the acting world

'I did, however, note that there was not one woman's name there behind the camera. I just hope, I pray, I know, that in five or ten years’ time, when the next Sam gets up and makes his or hopefully her speech, there will be two or three or four women's names there.'

She added: 'There are wonderful female directors coming up, many of them British, and it's wonderful to see that. So, go girls.'

Equally unimpressed is Thandie Newton who used a CNN interview last year to complain about 'casting couch style interviews' and told of an incident that took place when she was a teenager, in which a director asked her to sit with her legs open.

She continued: 'We all need to recognise our part in trying to be aware of sexism and exploitation. It's really bizarre that violence against women isn't a number one priority.'

Despite their pleas for change, as Miss L's blog reveals, it seems that the casting couch is one film fixture that is yet to be packed away. 

Along with bizarre requests for sexy nuns and the ability to withstand buckets of fake blood, Casting Call Woe also shines a light on some of the eye-wateringly sexist attributes included in casting ads.

Here are some of the worst:

'Busty Lab Workers: Two very under-qualified lab workers in cute shoes.'

'Male - fully clothed. Female - dressed in thong, semi-naked at times, has to do casting in underwear.'

'Must be able to portray a slag.'

'This production will require no nudity on camera however nudity will be required on set.'

'Be sexy. It sells.'

'She gets a couple of lines, a light-hearted orgy scene and then gets kicked through the window.'

'Well spoken bikini model needed to interview local politicians.'

'Character Traits - Sexy, Glam, Naughty, Lingerie, Barbie, Bimbo.'

'Girls must be up for semi-nudity, kissing and getting covered in muck and goo.'

'2 actors & 2 actresses required. Partial nudity required for the actresses.'
