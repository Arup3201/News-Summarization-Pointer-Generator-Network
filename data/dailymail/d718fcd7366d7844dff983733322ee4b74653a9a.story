Jailed: Gambling addict Sheikh Islam, 35, was jailed for life after murdering his wife in their east London flat in May last year. The court was told that Islam had 'not displayed any sign of remorse' since the incident

A gambler who stabbed his wife to death after she challenged him about his habit has been jailed for life.

Sheikh Islam stabbed his wife Rushna Begum, 28, in their council flat in Bromley-by-Bow, east London, while their two-year-old son watched on.

The 36-year-old gambling addict left the child alone in the house with his wife's dead body before arriving at a relative's home in tears and asking them to call the police.

He was ordered to serve a minimum term of 14-and-a-half years in prison after pleading guilty to murder at the Old Bailey.

Islam had been married to Mrs Begum, for 10 years and they had two sons together, but the court heard how thew couple's relationship turned violent as his gambling habit spun out of control.

Mrs Begum was subjected to death threats and domestic abuse as the couple's relationship became increasingly frayed.

Before the fatal incident, Mrs Begum had contacted police about her husband's abuse and also visited a domestic violence centre after being threatened with a knife.

Islam had gambled away up to £90,000 during the marriage, including the profits he
made from selling his takeaway shop in East Ham and a small kiosk, 
prosecutor Peter Kyte QC said.

Mrs Begum told police that she had been 'mentally tortured' by her husband since his gambling problems began in 2009.

In 2011 the couple, who had over £30,000 worth of debt, were taken to court by creditors, which acted as another catalyst for arguments.

She complained to her housing manager about her husband's threatening behaviour, saying she was 'extremely concerned' 
about her safety and the safety of her children.

She told the housing manager that her husband had threatened to kill her on 'numerous occasions'.

Mrs Begum said that she thought 'the reason is because he is addicted to gambling' and also said that their relationship had 'broken down'.

Islam also brandished a knife at his wife after another row in 2011, prompting her to contact police.

She told officers that she had been 'mentally tortured for the last two years', the court heard.

Only a few days later she attended a domestic violence centre, where she was seen to have a black eye and bruises.

In February, the couple's problems had caught the attention of their families who called a meeting to discuss their arguments.

During the meeting, Islam accused his 
wife of having an affair but also 'begged' her to forgive him for losing
their savings, spending her wages, selling her car and her jewellery.

She decided to stay with him but, a 
few weeks later, Islam started to threaten her again and said: 'I will 
put an end to your life.'

On May 25 2011, the day of the murder, 
Islam refused to take a phone call from Mrs Begum’s mother and the 
couple started to argue, said defence lawyer Jane Bickerstaff.

Islam claimed his
wife said 'I have broken my promise to you' during the argument, which he interpreted as meaning that 
she had been unfaithful.

He then stabbed her and claimed he thought his son was at nursery, before traveling to see relatives in Luton.

Islam arrived crying and trembling and asked his cousin to phone the police. When he was arrested the same day he said: 'I love my wife, I want to die.'

Police found the young child alone in the flat 'crying' and discovered a bloodied knife in the bin. The child told police: 'Mummy couldn’t answer the phone because she is sleeping.'

Mrs Begum was pronounced dead at the scene.

In a statement, Mrs 
Begum’s uncle, who helped arrange the marriage, said: 'The children have
had their whole world turned upside down.'

He said Mrs Begum’s mother was now 
looking after her two grandchildren but the youngest child suffered from
nightmares and was affected by the colour red.

Judge Brian Barker, the Common Serjeant of London, said gambling 'had got the better' of Islam and said the addiction led to his 'downfall, misery and finally disaster'.

He said Islam had caused 'untold anguish' to Mrs Begum's family and friends.

Detective Inspector Pete North described the incident as a 'violent and despicable crime' and said that Islam had not 'displayed any sign of remorse or compassion throughout the investigation'.

He added: 'This is demonstrated by the fact that
he murdered Rushna whilst their two-year-old son was present in the 
address and then left him alone with his mother’s lifeless body.

'It was only thanks to the concern of family members that he was found over four hours later. The tragedy of Islam’s crime is that he has deprived his two children of their mother.'
