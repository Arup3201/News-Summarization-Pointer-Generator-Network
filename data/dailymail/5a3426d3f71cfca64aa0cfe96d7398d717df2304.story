Norwich City were left to rue a succession of missed chances once again as Rotherham United collected a point at Carrow Road.

The Canaries had done everything but score in the midweek defeat here to Charlton Athletic and they were left kicking themselves again after a match in which they could easily have racked up four or five.

At least the sense of deja-vu didn’t include another defeat, with Cameron Jerome sliding in an equaliser with 13 minutes left to spare them after Kyle Lafferty’s clever low free-kick had ricocheted off the base of the post.

Cameron Jerome looks dejected after missing a chance - but he would eventually get his goal to equalise 

But that was the only one of Norwich’s 27 chances to count and Neil Adams will be concerned that his strikers are so profligate as they bid to bounce back immediately to the Premier League.

He will also be irked by John Ruddy’s rush of blood to the head late in the first half when the goalkeeper recklessly brought down Matt Derbyshire and Paul Green calmly stroked home a penalty to give Rotherham the lead against the grain of the game.

With Watford held at home by Brighton, the Canaries remain on their Championship perch but Nottingham Forest will return top if they beat Ipswich Town on Sunday.

Adams made two changes from the team beaten late on by Charlton in midweek, restoring Jonny Howson for his first league start of the season in place of Alexander Tettey and brining in Jos Hooiveld for Steven Whittaker.

Steve Evans brought in Derbyshire, Craig Morgan and Richard Brindley to the side that ended a five-match winless run against Blackburn Rovers on Tuesday.

And the Millers carved the first opportunity of the afternoon when Ben Pringle’s deep free-kick was knocked down at the back post by Morgan only for Derbyshire to get his feet in a muddle with the goal gaping and allow Ruddy to scramble clear.

Man of the match: Adam Collin 

In torrential Norfolk rain, table-topping Norwich quickly found their rhythm. Nippy Nathan Redmond looked dangerous every time he touched the ball and his square pass led to Bradley Johnson blazing over from a very good position.

Cameron Jerome, seeking to add to his six goals so far this season, was a constant torment to the Rotherham defence and he drove a shot wide from the edge of the area after Wes Hoolahan showed good awareness to tee him up.

Powerful frontman Jerome dominated in the air and twice headed wide, firstly from Martin Olsson’s left-wing cross and later from Redmond’s pinpoint free-kick from the right.

The match had started to lose its fizz but an extraordinary 42nd minute ignited things once again.

Rotherham keeper Adam Collin pulled off an incredible double save, initially to deny Lewis Grabban’s header from a Redmond free-kick, then to block Jerome’s point-blank follow-up. Jerome also saw a shot blocked off the line by Kari Arnason during the same goalmouth scramble.

The Millers, lucky not to be behind, then broke with pace and precision, a dangerous long ball over the top prompting Ruddy to clatter Derbyshire and Green made Norwich pay from 12 yards.

Norwich, who enjoyed 65 per cent of possession, started the second half with intent and Grabban fired a ball across the goalmouth that was just begging for a touch. Nobody obliged.

But sometimes Norwich’s sloppiness in passing proved their downfall. Alex Revell pounced on a slack Hoolahan pass and played in Derbyshire, who drove his shot wide of the far post. Those in the crowd in yellow and green groaned their disapproval.

Just after the hour, Redmond’s free-kick caused carnage as it fizzed across the box, with Rotherham somehow managing to hack it to safety,

Two minutes later, substitute Kyle Lafferty’s shot deflected off Jerome and wrong-footed Collin, only to strike the base of the post.

Norwich’s pressure had become as incessant as the drizzle and Johnson drew a smart save from Collin, who also had to push away Olsson’s wicked curling cross from underneath his crossbar.

Despite Norwich’s dominance, Rotherham still posed an occasional threat on the counter-attack, with Howson clearing off the line from Morgan’s header from Green’s cross.

There really could be no complaints when Jerome found himself in the right place at the right time to knock in Norwich’s equaliser 13 minutes from time. It was the 27-year-old’s seventh in eight matches this season but any celebrations were cut short when his knee collided with the post in the act of scoring.

The pain was worth it for the point gained, though Norwich were left feeling they should have taken more and indeed they could have done when Morgan sliced over his own goal deep into stoppage time.
