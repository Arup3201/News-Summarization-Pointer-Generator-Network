With a global football icon for a father, it was hardly surprising that Brooklyn Beckham has been a target for his old club.

But despite David Beckham's son training at Manchester United this week, he will not be offered a deal at the club, Sportsmail can reveal today.

The 14-year-old, the eldest of Beckham's four children, was at United's Carrington training ground on yesterday accompanied by his father.

He has spent the last couple of days training with United's youngsters and took part in a practice match.

But it was not a trial as such, and Brooklyn will not be offered terms at the club where his father made his name.

Brooklyn would have had to have gone some to emulate his father's success at Old Trafford.

Beckham Snr played 394 times for Manchester United, scoring 85 goals.

He won six Premier League titles, two FA Cups, one Intercontinental Cup and, of course, one Champions League.

But all is not lost for the eldest of Beckham's four children.

The brother of Romeo, 12, Cruz, eight, and Harper, two, had trials at Chelsea in January and has been training withÂ  the Queens Park
Rangers' academy - alongside Dennis Wise's son Henry.

The two played together in
a friendly for their U14s team against Charlton in September.

His younger brother Romeo, 12, has also trained with Arsenal's academy.

His younger brother Romeo, 12, has also enjoyed training with Arsenal's academy.

The Beckham boys have always been in close attendance to their famous father throughout his globetrotting career.

They have often turned up at training, occasionally alongside illustrious team-mates such as Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Thiago Silva.

Indeed Brooklyn's football skills have been witnessed before at Old Trafford.

He was introduced to the Theatre of Dreams' crowd at the tender age of just two years old when he accompanied his father on United's lap of honour following their Premier League title triumph of 2001.

Even then in front of the massed photographers he showed an aptitude for the game by scoring an impromptu goal.
