Tottenham’s Nacer Chadli has no interest in joining PSV Eindhoven so any deal for Memphis Depay will be straight cash.

PSV technical director Marcel Brands has insisted Depay will stay ahead of Thursday’s Europa League qualifier but Tottenham will press for a deal over the weekend.

However, the Holland international has hinted he is open to a move abroad after revealing he would consider a transfer away from PSV if one comes his way.

The 20-year-old enhanced his reputation at the World Cup, where he starred for Holland in their third-place finish.

'I understand that fans want me to play well this season in Eindhoven, but ultimately I'm the one who decides how my career will look and no one else.'
