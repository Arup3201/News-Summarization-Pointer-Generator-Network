Matthew Eric Emans was charged with animal cruelty in Fort Myers, FloridaMatthew Eric Emans

A Florida teacher has been charged with animal cruelty after he locked his five-month-old puppy in the trunk of his car while he taught at school.

Two students spotted Mathew Emans, 28, take the puppy out of the trunk of a Mercedes and walk it around for a brief period before putting it back in there on Friday.

The students at Gateway Charter High School in Fort Myers alerted a school resource officer, who called police and Emans was ordered to open the trunk.

TheÂ  five-months-old Staffordshire Terrier puppy, named Oakley, was still alive but was panting and in need of water.

Officers took the temperature inside the trunk and found it to be 152 degrees.

Lee County Domestic Animal Services were called and Emans surrendered the dog to the welfare officers.

The puppy was rushed to the LCDAS' veterinary clinic for care and is now up for adoption.

Emans told investigators he was only 'working half a day' and that the puppy was in the trunk for 'only 'a few hours'.

Emans has been charged with animal cruelty and faces up to a year in jail and a fine of $5,000.
