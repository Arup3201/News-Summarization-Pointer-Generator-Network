She is the fading Southern belle at the centre of Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire.

Now, a London-based theatre critic has revealed that she was the inspiration behind Blanche DuBois.

Blanche Marvin, who will turn 90 in two months, claimed the U.S. playwright used both her first and maiden names for the iconic character and her sister in the 1947 Pulitzer Prize-winning play.

She also said an off-the-cuff remark provided him with DuBois's most famous line: 'I've always depended on the kindness of strangers.'

'Tennessee fell in love with my name, 
which was then Blanche Zohar,' she said. 'Zohar means "star" and the name of the 
sister, Stella, also means star. He would take 
  things out of conversation and would transpose it into a play. That was the 
  genius of the man.'

American-born Ms Marvin, who was awarded an MBE for services to theatre four years ago, is a successful critic who spends most nights attending theatre performances.

She became a close friend of Williams in 
1944 after meeting him when he was struggling with rehearsals on 
Broadway for his breakthrough play, The Glass Menageries.

Playwright: Ms Marvin, who will turn 90 in two months, claimed that Williams (pictured in 1978) used her first name for the main character in the 1947 play. She also said she provided him with DuBois's most famous line

Ms Marvin told The Independent on Sunday the pair were introduced by the play's director Margo Jones, saying: 'We began to talk and there was a real affinity between us. The two of us ended up crying on each other's shoulders.'

Explaining how she came to inspire DuBois's iconic line, she added: 'He talked about living in hotel rooms all the time 
and was unhappy. He said he was always living with 
strangers. I said, "I've known only kindness from strangers, and so can 
you".'

A Street Car Named Desire, which first
 opened on Broadway in December 1947, tells the story of fallen DuBois, 
who moves into her sister's apartment and is tormented by her brutish 
brother-in-law.

Play: A new adaptation of the play, starring former X-Files actress Gillian Anderson (pictured), will open at London's Young Vic theatre tomorrow. Ms Marvin will be among the audience. It will run until September 19

The original 1949 London production starred Vivien Leigh and was directed by Laurence Olivier.
