It was just too good to last. The driest start to autumn in 50 years was sure to have a downside – and yesterday it arrived in the form of smog across the South.

As the pollution hit danger levels, the elderly and those with lung and heart problems were warned not to exert themselves outside due to the poor air quality.

The heavy pollution was caused by fumes from diesel cars on our roads as well as emissions from factories on the continent.

Sunbathers enjoyed the warm weather in Lyme Regis, Dorset today but the driest start to autumn in 50 years will not last 

The Environment Department issued the health warning as smog reached the second highest level of between seven and nine on its scale which goes up to ten. But our changeable weather means that thankfully, the smog isn’t here to stay as thunderstorms are likely to blow it away today.

Forecasters have warned that our Indian summer will come to a dramatic end as an inch of rain is expected to fall in just two hours.

Yesterday, temperatures hit a sweltering 26C (79F) in Sussex, which is 10 degrees above the average September daytime temperature. Last night the Met Office issued weather warnings for the South, the Midlands and most of Wales.

Paul Gundersen, chief forecaster at the Met Office, said: ‘A warm and humid airmass covers southern Britain at present.

‘This is already becoming increasingly unstable and producing a few thunderstorms through Thursday, but these are expected to become more widespread overnight into Friday and extend further north into the Midlands and Wales.

‘Many places will miss the worst of these – some may stay dry – but where they do occur, one inch of rain may fall in a short time, leading to some surface water flooding, while lightning and hail may be additional hazards.’

The torrential rain will fade away on Saturday and Sunday will be dry for most. However, the time has come to pack away your T-shirts and take out the scarves as temperatures are set to plummet to 5C (41F) in the North and 6C (43F) in the South on Sunday night.
