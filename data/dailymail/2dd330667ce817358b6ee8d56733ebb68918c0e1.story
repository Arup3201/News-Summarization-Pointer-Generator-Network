Yaya Toure, Angel di Maria and Adam Lallana may have done enough to feature in this week's top 10, but a two-goal performance from Sunderland's Steven Fletcher means the Scottish striker sails to the top of EA Sports' Player Performance Index PPI chart.

Here, EA Sports crunch the numbers to reveal the 10 best Premier League performers from the weekend. Sunderland striker Steven Fletcher tops the charts but who else makes the top 10?

10. Wilfried Bony, Swansea (PPI score: 37.6)

The Swansea striker has had a mixed start to the Premier League season in a Swansea shirt, but proved his worth once again with a low finish to put his team in the lead against Newcastle on Saturday afternoon. 

The Ivorian striker saw three of his attempts hit the target as he led Swansea's line at the Liberty Stadium.   

The EA Sports PPI is the official player rating index of the  Premier League.

It measures a player's contribution to the success of his team. The intention is to remove any opinion bias and only work with proven statistical measurements which become more accurate as the season progresses. So, what are the six indices?

1. Winning performance

2. Player's performance per match

3. Appearances

4. Goals scored

5. Assists

6. Clean sheets

9. Yaya Toure, Man City (PPI score: 41.6)

Many have questioned Toure's performances this season, but the big midfielder stepped up when Manchester City need him most and provided a crucial goal which gave his side a 1-0 lead after 82 minutes.

Toure kept his side ticking with a total of 128 accurate passes as City looked to break down a spirited defensive display from Paul Lambert's side.

8. Jordan Henderson, Liverpool (PPI score: 42.0)

Henderson continued his run of fine form in a Liverpool shirt with a winning goal and brilliant performance for Liverpool against West Brom on Saturday.

The Reds had taken the lead through Adam Lallana before a Saido Berahino penalty pulled the Baggies level in the 56th minute.

The England midfielder struck just five minutes later to cap a showing that included an 88.5 per cent pass completion rate.

7. Riyad Mahrez (PPI score: 42.1)

The Algerian midfielder managed three dribbles, one cross and an assist during a star performance as Leicester battled to a 2-2 draw with Burnley.

Mahrez forced Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton into an impressive save in the 20th minute before crossing for Jeff Schlupp in the first half.

6. Christian Eriksen (PPI score: 42.2) 

The Danish midfielder helped Tottenham to record their first home win August 24 after his fine strike put his side into a 1-0 lead after 40 minutes.

Eriksen carved out four crosses while seeing one of his two attempts on target hit the back of the net.

5. Connor Wickham, Sunderland (PPI score: 43.9) 

The Sunderland youngster impressed as Sunderland strolled to victory against Stoke. Wickham may not have been able to get on the scoresheet, but he did just enough for a top five spot after four attempted dribbles.

4. Adam Lallana (PPI score: 44.3)

The Liverpool new boy scored his first Liverpool goal on the stroke of half-time to put his side ahead against West Brom on Saturday.

The former Southampton midfielder completed 82.9 per cent of his passes as he drove Liverpool onto an important 2-1 at Anfield.   

Adam Lallana scored his first goal in a Liverpool shirt and finished fourth in this week's charts

3. Angel di Maria (PPI score: 50.3) 

Angel di Maria continued to impress since his big money move to Old Trafford with another Manchester United goal.

Di Maria put Louis van Gaal's side ahead against Everton in the 27th minute whilst making a whopping 10 crosses as United ran out 2-1 winners.  

2. Papiss Cisse (PPI score: 51.3) 

If Alan Pardew manages to keep his job as Newcastle manager, there's no doubt striker Papiss Cisse will deserve a huge pat on the back from the under-fire boss.

Cisse saved Pardew's side from defeat for the second time this season with another point-saving brace.

Cisse scored twice from just three attempts on target as the Magpies draw 2-2 with Swansea.  

Angel di Maria continued his fine run of form with a goalscoring performance against Everton

1. Steven Fletcher (PPI score: 61.0)

Sunderland striker Fletcher tops this week's PPI charts as his double helped Sunderland to an impressive 3-1 win against Stoke.

Not happy with scoring two goals from his two shots on target, Fletcher also did his bit for the defence as he won three of his tackles.
