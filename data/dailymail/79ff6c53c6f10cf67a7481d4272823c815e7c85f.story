Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the EU is now a 'putative superstate'

Britain is 'lighting a fire under the European Union' by pledging an in-out referendum, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said today.

Mr Hammond said Brussels would not be able to extinguish public demands for a vote on Britain's membership of the EU following the Prime Minister's pledge to hold a referendum by 2017.

The Foreign Secretary, who remarks are among the most Eurosceptic ever made by a serving Cabinet minister, added that the EU has become a 'putative superstate' without Britain's say-so.

Mr Hammond's claim came in a Commons debate today on a Tory bid to guarantee an EU referendum in law after the next election.

He told the House that the issue was 'surely the most important strategic question facing this country', adding: 'We are lighting a fire under the European Union by this piece of legislation.

'We are setting off a process that politicians and governments do not have the power to stop.'

He claimed that the threat of leaving the EU would give the Government 'a very powerful weapon in our armoury' when renegotiating Britain's relationship with Brussels.

It came after the Tory MP launching a new legislative bid for a poll said it was time for opponents of a referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union to 'put up or shut up'.

Mr Neill, the MP for Bromley and Chislehurst, introduced the European Union Referendum Bill surrounded by Conservative MPs but facing only a handful of the Labour opposition MPs.

The Bill is identical to one which cleared the Commons last year before getting trapped in the House of Lords and failing.

Ukip's MP Douglas Carswell, who voted for the Bill while a Tory MP in the last session, was one of about a dozen MPs on the opposition benches while Mr Neill introduced the second reading.

Mr Neill said: 'This Bill is about choice - it's about giving the British people a choice about something which is fundamental to our constitutional arrangements and it is fundamental to our future.

'It's a straightforward and simple Bill because the proposition of choice and a democratic principle for our people is a simple one.

'It is not a Bill about the future of our relationship with the European Union. It is not a Bill about whether we should in the long term stay in the European Union. It's a Bill about giving the people of this country a choice.'

Ed Miliband is facing a growing rebellion from his own party over his refusal to offer an EU referendum, it emerged this week.

Thirty-four Labour MPs have now declared publicly that they disagree with their leader’s stance on an in/out vote on Britain’s place in Europe.

They include Labour’s policy chief Jon Cruddas, shadow education minister Steve McCabe, and two former Labour government ministers, Keith Vaz and Andrew Smith.

Meanwhile yesterday it emerged that Ed Balls, the shadow Chancellor, has suggested Labour should back the Conservatives in proposing reform of EU free movement rules. 

Mr Balls agreed there could no longer be a ‘free-for-all’ in terms of the migration of workers within the EU.

Mr Hammond, who said he was speaking for the Conservative Party rather than the Government, stressed that the instincts of the British people should be trusted.

He told the Commons: 'It is right that the British people should make the decision on whether the United Kingdom stays in the European Union or leaves altogether just as it was right that the Scottish people made the decision about their future in the UK.

'Every poll shows that whatever their view on the answer to that question the overwhelming majority want the right to decide.

'In the 41 years since the United Kingdom joined the European Economic Community, in the 39 years since we last had a referendum on Europe, the EU has changed profoundly.

'It has grown enormously in its power and its reach. It's grown in its competences, its legislation has spread and the role of the European Parliament has increased almost beyond recognition at the expense of the other European institutions.

'It has morphed from a common market into a putative superstate.

'Put plainly, Europe today is very different from the Europe people voted for in 1975 and yet the British people have never been asked whether they agreed with any of these changes.

'So it should be no surprise to us that democratic support for the EU is fragile to put it diplomatically. Ever closer union has led to ever greater dissolution.'

Mr Hammond added: 'This is surely the most important strategic question facing this country today - the future of our relationship with the European Union.

'And it is a question on which we should trust the instincts of the British people.'

Mr Hammond added: 'The ultimate decision of whether to or whether to stay should be for the British people.

'The key thing is when we have completed the negotiation and we bring back the result of it, it's not a question of whether we think the outcome is good enough. It's not a question of whether Parliament thinks the outcome is good enough.

'It will be a question of whether the British people think the outcome is good enough. Not only is that good for democracy it is also good for our negotiating position.'

Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said: 'Labour believes any judgment about a referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union has to be based on what is in the national interest.

'We do not believe a Bill calling for an in/out referendum in 2017 on an arbitrary date, unrelated to the likely timetable of major treaty change, that puts jobs and investment at risk, is in our national interest.

Mr Alexander also declared the recent defections of two Conservative MPs to Ukip - Mr Carswell and Mark Reckless - the 'real reason' for the timing of the Bill.
