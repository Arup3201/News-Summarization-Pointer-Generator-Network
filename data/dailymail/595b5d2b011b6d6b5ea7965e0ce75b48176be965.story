A pair of knickers and matching bra have been created which seem to slightly take away the point of underwear.

Detailing the anatomy of the female reproductive system and the breasts, the pant and bra set is similar to the more simple ‘nipple bikini’ which hit headlines recently.

Part of the ‘Free the Nipple’ movement which aims to end the stigma surrounding female bodies, the bikini caused a stir as celebrities like Cara Delevingne shared pictures of it online.

The bra and pants make up Eleanor Haswell's piece 'Why are you so afraid of your anatomy?'

The pants detail the female reproductive organs including the ovaries, vagina and uterus 

However the 'Why are you so afraid of your own anatomy?' pieces go a step further by showing all parts considered ‘taboo’ about the female form.

The work of young artist Eleanor Beth Haswell, 18, from County Durham, the vagina pants and bra are part of her growing portfolio of art inspired by gender inequalities.

One set of pictures, entitled 'Prick', shows a woman with thorns instead of underarm hair, aiming to highlight upon the constant narrow-minded views that it is somehow an abnormal occurrence for a woman to have body hair.

Speaking to MailOnline Eleanor says: ‘The main influence for me for this piece is the divide that's been made between genders.

'I began to notice a lot more shaming online, the amount of negative comments gathered online is incredible. It's often that you hear the typical slut-shaming comments about girls who choose to do what they want with their own bodies.

Model Cara Delevingne posted a second picture of a topless couple standing next to each other denoting the anatomical similarities between the male and female nipple to her six million followers

The model also posted this image of a woman in a flesh coloured bikini top complete with realistic nipples in support of the Free the Nipple campaign

'This piece isn't being gender specific suggesting that only women have this particular anatomy, but it is to highlight upon the major difference in our society. It's to question those who think it's acceptable to shame one gender over another - who decides whose nipples are accepted for the world to see.

'There always comments being made about women who have body hair, who have cellulite, anything that doesn't live up to the standards set by society.

'This is pushed on to us from an early age, the amount of comments made about women who have chosen to have body hair disgusts me. It is one of the most natural things, everyone has it yet it is constantly frowned upon.

'It's the 21st century and women are still constantly feeling pressured to live up to these expectations of what is attractive, and it shouldn't have to be that way; it's all down to personal choice.'
