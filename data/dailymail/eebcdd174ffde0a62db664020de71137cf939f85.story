She is the self-proclaimed 'female boss'. And now it seems that Tulisa Contostavlos may have reason to believe her own hype as it is revealed that more people searched online for the X Factor judge during 2012 than any other celebrity.

Proving she really does have the X Factor, Tulisa beat off strong competition from the Duchess of Cambridge, and knocking teen heartthrob and 2011 winner Justin Bieber from first to fifth place.

While Tulisa’s singing career and role as X Factor judge no doubt inspired many of these searches, the leak of a certain X-rated video in March likely played a large part. 

Tulisa Contostavlos beat the Duchess of Cambridge to the top spot as most searched for celebrity of 2012

It was also a big year for 2012’s second most-searched person, the Duchess of Cambridge. Already a top performed in internet search charts, those unauthorised holiday snaps of the Duchess sunbathing sent people online in their droves to find out more.

Based on the aggregation of billions of search queries by search engine Bing, it was revealed that Prince Harry also got people searching after his royal Vegas antics.

The third in line to the throne was the UK’s sixth most-searched person (poor William didn't make an appearance in the top 10), behind Cheryl Cole, the late Whitney Houston and Justin Bieber. 

Robert Pattinson, Rihanna, Kim Kardashian and disgraced TV presenter Jimmy Savile round out the top 10.

Last year's number one Justin Bieber came in fifth place just ahead of Prince Harry whose Vegas antics caused an online stir

In the aftermath of the Games, it’s to be expected that Olympics and London 2012 were the most-searched events of 2012, and sure enough, Olympians led the most-searched sports stars' list.

Gold medal-winning cyclist and Strictly Come Dancing star Victoria Pendleton raced to the top, followed by sprinter Usain Bolt and gold medallist tennis star Andy Murray.

Stricken footballer Fabrice Muamba was the fourth most searched sportsperson, with heptathlete Jessica Ennis in fifth place.

Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson's on-off relationship made them the most searched for couple

Most-searched celebrity couple Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart kept Britons guessing with their on-again, off-again romance this year, but their new movie, Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 2, could only muster fifth place in the most-searched movies list, with the top spot taken by The Avengers.

EastEnders beat reality TV rivals Big Brother and X Factor to become 2012’s most searched TV show.

Bing UK Director of Search Dave Coplin, said: 'Every year, the Bing search results give us a unique insight into what and who is top of mind for Brits.

'It’s always fascinating to see which celebrities have had the biggest impact on Britons throughout the year, and of course it’s no surprise to see that the 2012 Olympics and Olympians have captured our hearts and minds after such a golden summer.'
