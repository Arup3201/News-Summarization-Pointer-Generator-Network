The royal family has fashion fever as Princess Eugenie followed in her mother's footsteps by taking centre stage at a London Fashion Week event last night.

Just days after Sarah, Duchess of York, strutted her stuff in a long black dress down the catwalk for Naomi Campbell's charity show, Fashion For Relief, her daughter Princess Eugenie did her own bit for style.

Looking chic in an all-black ensemble and red lips, the 24-year-old, joined celebrities and the art crowd at the Coach X Serpentine Future Contemporaries Party at The Serpentine Sackler Gallery, London.

While Oscar fever was taking hold in Los Angeles, homegrown stars were getting ready for the annual designer showcase of London Fashion Week.

Princess Eugenie - who had just flown home after a long week of fashion week festivities in New York, where she works as a benefit auctions manager at Paddle8 - looked every inch the fashionista.

She donned a black skater dress with strappy heels, a patent leather black Moschino clutch, and a leather jacket with fur panels.

Black eyeliner, a slick of red lipstick and gold and tuquoise earrings completed the look.

She was joined by the likes of model Daisy Lowe, DJ Mary Charteris and indie rock band Warpaint, who concluded the evening with a lively performance.

She later took off her jacket to show off her dress, boldly braving the wintry weather in bare legs. 

Other guests on the night included singer MIA, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo star Noomi Rapace, blogger Susie Bubble, Atlanta de Cadenet, daughter of Amanda de Cadanet and Duran Duran's John Tayor, Jack Guinnes and Pixie Lott.

London Fashion Week has only just begun, but it's likely the style-savvy Princess will be a regular fixture on the front row.

She's the second member of her family to get into the style spirit in the last few days after the Duchess of York gave a spirited show at Fashion For Relief at Somerset House. 

In a floor-length black gown she wore her hair down and little jewellery except for an eye-catching Fabergé Soleil de Nuit platinum necklace, featuring pear-shaped white diamonds and moonstones.

In 2007, Eugenie's sister Beatrice even joined her mother on the catwalk, walking the Fashion For Relief runway with her mother, wearing matching fitted, floor-length black dresses.
