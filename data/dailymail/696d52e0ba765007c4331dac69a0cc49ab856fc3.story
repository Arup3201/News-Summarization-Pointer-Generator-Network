An unknown man who captured his own image in a photobooth 445 times over 30 years is proving to be a mystery.

Starting in the 1930s, he took black and white selfies in a photobooth over three decades until the 1960s, charting his passage through time.

Most of the pictures show the mystery man grinning at the camera in the photobooth while others show him almost scowling as his mood changes.

For three decades this unknown man took over 445 selfies in photobooths from the 1930s to the 1960s. They now form a new exhibition at Rutgers University

It is thought the man may have been a photobooth technician and took the pictures as a way of testing the equipment

Nobody knows for sure exactly who the man is, or indeed why he took the pictures of himself over the 30 years, especially as taking self portraits were a lot harder back then.

In some of the pictures he is seen sporting a fedora and smoking a pipe, while other times he is dressed in a suit.

The pictures are now being shared in an exhibition at Rutgers University in New Jersey in an appropriately named show called '445 Portraits of Man'.

The exhibit is being shown at the Rutgers' Zimmerli Art Museum in New Brunswick and they say they are taking these early selfies and showing them as art.

The images on display of the unknown man were taken during a time when photobooths were hugely popular in the United States.

The 445 prints are owned by historian Donald Lokuta, who bought the pictures two years ago at a New York City antiques show.

He originally only came across a handful of the photographs but the dealer told him there were hundreds more images of the man and he decided to buy them all.

Mr Lokuta told Rutgers: 'As a historian, I knew this was very rare, but on a deeper level, I wondered, "Why would somebody want to take almost 500 photos of himself in a photobooth?"'

'Thereâ€™s quite an age difference in the photos: You see him as younger man and then with a white, receding hairline and wrinkles.'

It is thought the mystery man in the pictures could be from the Midwest and it is hoped the exhibition will shed new light on his identity

Mr Lokuta also added that based on conversations with another historian, it could be likely that the mystery man was a photobooth technician, who was taking the pictures to test out the equipment.

It is also likely that he hailed from the U.S. Midwest, and it is hoped the exhibition will shed new light on who the man is.

It is thought the photos originated previously from an auction in Michigan.
