A 93-year-old Central Texas woman was fatally shot at her home by a police officer - who has a history of fatal shootings - when after she allegedly brandished a gun, the Hearne Police Department said Wednesday.

Pearlie Golden, a longtime resident of Hearne who was affectionately known to her neighbors as Ms. Sully, was shot Tuesday night by Officer Steven Stem, Robertson County District Attorney Coty Siegert said.Â 

Stem was responding to a 911 call about a disturbance involving a woman with a gun.

According to KBTX, Golden was shot five times after raising her weapon. The station also reports that it was Golden's nephew who called police about the dispute.

According to the station, Golden's nephew called police after he took the elderly woman's car keys because she is no longer allowed to drive.

Golden then reportedly grabbed her gun and began threatening her nephew.

When police arrived at about 6:30 p.m., Golden was standing in front of her home waving the gun in the air.

A one-paragraph press release issued by the department Wednesday said officers responded to a 911 call involving "a female with a gun."

The Hearne Police Department said in a written statement that Golden 'brandished a firearm' when Stem encountered her. He then shot her multiple times.

A revolver believed to be the weapon Golden had at the time of the shooting was found at the scene by officers, the statement said.

She was taken to a hospital in nearby Bryan where she died from the injuries.

The investigation is being handled by the Texas Rangers.

'She did have a gun. ... Now, what she was doing with it, that is the ultimate question,' said Siegert.

City attorney Bryan Russ Jr. said the officer has been put on paid administrative leave as is standard protocol when an officer is involved in a shooting.

'What we believe is that she was instructed to drop the weapon, that is my understanding,' Russ said.

in 2012, Stem fatally shot a man named Tederalle Satchell while responding to a report of a vehicle with three passengers that had fired weapons at 'a large group of people in the parking lot' of a local apartment complex, according to a 2013 report from The Eagle.

Stem ultimately was cleared of any wrongdoing by a grand jury.

Stachell's cousin, Waymon Webster, says Stem is a danger to the community.

'What are they going to do, let him go, so he can smile and hold another
 pistol? You know what I mean? It's not right,' Webster told KBTX.com.
