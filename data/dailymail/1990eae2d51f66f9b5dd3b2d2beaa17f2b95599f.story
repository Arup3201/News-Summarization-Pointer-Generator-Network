Ex England international David Bentley has taken up Gaelic football.

The 30-year-old former Tottenham and Blackburn winger has switched codes as part of a documentary, after retiring from football last year.

He has been training with Armagh club Crossmaglen Rangers to give the sport a try for a show that will air on Irish television in March.

And Crossmaglen star Aaron Kernan will go the other way to train with Premier League side Sunderland.

Bentley has trained with Crossmaglen for the past two nights and will play in a challenge game against local rivals Silverbridge on Wednesday night.

‘You can be guaranteed the lad from Silverbridge who will be marking David won’t want him to score 1-4 off him,’ said Kernan.

Bentley played for a host of Premier League clubs including a stint at Tottenham Hotspur

Bentley was also capped seven times by England between 2007 and 2008

Bentley is going to live the life of a  player for the documentary and is even working for Kernan’s property letting company.

He appeared for his first training session with Crossmaglen on Monday night.

‘There was a bit of slagging, because we have a few Arsenal supporters,' added Kernan. ‘And there is a token Tottenham fan in the team.’
