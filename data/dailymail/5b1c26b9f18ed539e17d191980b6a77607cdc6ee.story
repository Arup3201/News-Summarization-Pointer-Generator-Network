A paedophile has been jailed after he was tracked down sleeping rough as a tramp in France following a five-year manhunt.

Peter Scott, 58, fled the UK after a string of sex attacks on three girls in the 1980s, two of whom were a young as 11 when the abuse started.

Scott, originally from Manchester, was arrested earlier this year after he was found living on the streets of Foix, a small, picturesque city in southern France close to the border with Spain.

Police had made an unsuccessful appeal to trace him in 2009 using a digitally-enhanced picture to show how he may have aged.

But he was finally caught after making an application for a new passport as part his attempts to secure a council house.

The application triggered an alert to Greater Manchester Police (GMP) and a European Arrest Warrant was obtained and Scott was later extradited.

Scott was jailed for eight years at Manchester Crown Court on Friday after he admitted 23 offences including gross indecency with a child and indecent assault on a child.

He was also ordered to sign on to the sex offenders register for life.

Scott had repeatedly preyed on his victims in Manchester, Hattersley, Greater Manchester and St Helens, Merseyside, over several years in the 1980s.

But they kept their ordeals secret until coming forward in 2007.

Checks made at the time suggested Scott was living in a house in Swansea but when police investigated they found he was no longer there.

After receiving a tip-off that he was attempting to flee the country a warning was issued to all ports but Scott slipped the net.

Detective Sergeant Suzanne Keenaghan, of GMP, said: 'Our determination to find Peter Scott was greater than his determination to avoid this day.

'When we realised he may have exiled himself abroad, we put in place a number of controls that meant there was only so much Scott could do without us becoming aware of his whereabouts.'

She added: 'The abuse that these victims suffered through the years is unimaginable. Having spent so much time with them through the whole process I am able to see first-hand the major impact this has had on their lives.

'I just hope now that this may bring some closure to them so that they can try to move on.

'They have a lot to be proud of in the way they conducted themselves throughout the entire process bearing in mind they reported it in 2007 and didn't get their justice until 2013.

'These women should give an example to anyone else who may have suffered similar abuse.

'I understand that many victims feel that the easiest thing to do is simply try and forget about the past and keep their experiences bottled up.

'For us, it is never too late for abuse to be reported.'
