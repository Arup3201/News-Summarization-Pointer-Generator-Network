The dreaded grey skies and crippling post-holiday blues are enough to compel millions of Brits  to  book their next exciting getaway in early September and enjoy some glorious sunshine.

Shorter days, damp cold weather and decreasing sunlight are also a major factor as people adjust to the change of seasons and desperately seek one last summer fix.

This Monday, 8 September, has been branded 'Travel Blue Monday,' a day in which record numbers of Britons are most likely to feel glum about the UK climate and book an exciting trip abroad.

Monarch Airlines says it has experienced a 30 per cent spike in bookings on 'Travel Blue Monday' in the past as the dreary climate and the return to work following a summer holiday encourages Brits to plan another escape.

The desire for late sunshine is so strong for many holidaymakers that Monarch Airlines says 45 per cent of those who book their trip do so with the intention of taking a break within the next six weeks.

A further one in five buoys themselves with the promise of a summer holiday, booking their next annual trip to give themselves something to look forward to during the cold winter months.

Over half (52 per cent) of Brits booking on this peak day secure a leisurely week away, whilst one in six plans a major break lasting longer than 10 days. One in eight plumps for a quick-fix treat, booking a short break to whisk them away.

A dreary  wet morning in the UK is hard to appreciate after a long summer and many Brits will relish a holiday

Sunshine is the top priority for Brits fed up with the soggy UK, with a significant 93 per cent of bookings being made to sun destinations such as the Balearics, Canaries and Sharm-El-Sheik.

Spain is the most desirable destination for British people, making up 42 per cent of all flights booked.

Southerners seem to be most affected by the return to work, with over 40% of bookings being made for flights out of Gatwick and Luton airports.

Ian Chambers, head of retail and online at Monarch Airlines, said: 'Having experienced a wonderful summer holiday and extra days off thanks to a series of bank holidays, September with its return to work can bring many people back to earth with a bump.'

Mr Chambers said the prospect of not having any time off until Christmas and being stuck in the grey and cold UK climate is not very appealing.

He said: 'The second Monday of September seems to bring a collective need across the nation to escape, or at least have a break to look forward to, no matter how far away it may seem.

'Last year saw bookings increase by almost a third on Travel Blue Monday - with the heat wave that we’ve enjoyed this summer followed by a frankly miserable August weather-wise in the UK, we’re anticipating an even greater spike in sales.'
