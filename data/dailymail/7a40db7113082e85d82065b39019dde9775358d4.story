A director of British Naturism has been forced to quit his high-profile role after admitting downloading more than 120,000 child porn images.

Brian Taylor, 59, was head of public relations for the group and was chairman of the Spectrum Swimming Club for naturists in Northfield, Birmingham.

But he has now been forced to quit both roles after being convicted of child porn offences and placed on the Sex Offenders Register.

It has since been revealed that Taylor had previously written about naked images of children, claiming in one his blogs: 'Remember nudity does not equal pornography... it is possible for a naked image to not be pornographic.'

Taylor, of Tamworth, pleaded guilty to six counts of making indecent images of children during a hearing at Stafford Crown Court earlier this summer.

They included 95 category A images, 431 category B, and more than 128,000 category C.

He was sentenced to a three year community order consisting of a 'supervision-intensive sex offender treatment course' at the same court on August 26.

Taylor, who is understood to be separated from his wife, was also ordered to pay £400 costs and placed on the Sex Offenders Register for five years.

He resigned from his unpaid director role at British Naturism and as chairman of Spectrum Club on September 2 after both learned of the conviction.

British Naturism is the UK's officially recognised naturist organisation which has a membership of around 10,500 people.

Taylor had been a naturist for more than 30 years and previously stated: 'Naturism is about body acceptance and countering the body shame born of being constantly told to cover our bodies and then presented with air-brushed models in the media.'

But it has been revealed that he also made comments on his blogs on British Naturism websites about naked children.

He said: 'Remember nudity does not equal pornography, it is perfectly possible for a non-naked image of a child to be pornographic, just as it is possible for a naked image to not be pornographic - take for instance the pictures that many parents take of their children having fun in the bath....'

In another post, he said: 'Young children love to be naked themselves and seldom even notice the nakedness of others. 

'It is only after prudish adults have brainwashed children that they grow into prudish adults themselves.'

A British Naturism spokesman said last night: 'It's difficult for us, we knew him well and had known him for many years.

'We are very surprised and stunned by the news. As with all members, when news of this nature reaches us, membership is terminated.'

The Spectrum Club confirmed Taylor had resigned on September 2 after the club learned of his conviction. He had not informed them. 

He had been a member since 2006 and chairman since 2013.
