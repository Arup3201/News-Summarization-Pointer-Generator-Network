Steven Gerrard has confirmed he would like to return to Liverpool in some capacity in the future.

The Liverpool captain announced on Friday that he will be leaving Anfield for America when his contract expires in the summer.

One-club man Gerrard has been at Liverpool since the age of eight and told their official TV channel he hopes this is not the end of his relationship with the club.

'I'll only come back and serve the club if I feel as if I can help,' the 34-year-old said. 'I'll always be a fan, of course, no matter what happens in the future. But I think that's something I'll have to consider.

'I think when you've been part of a club like this for so long and you've contributed in the way I've tried to, I'd always want that to stay the same in the future.

'I wouldn't like to come back just to be Steven Gerrard the player and just be around. I'd like to help in whatever capacity that may be.

'If I sit down with the people who are running the club at that time and they see a role for me where I can help the team or help young kids to become players, of course I will consider it because, as you say, it's been such a big part of my life.'

Throughout the interview Gerrard repeatedly referred to leaving Liverpool for a 'short while' and added: 'Hopefully it's more of a "see you soon" rather than a "goodbye".'
