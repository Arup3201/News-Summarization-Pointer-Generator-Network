A Maryland woman who lost her 15-month-old son last year and whose former fiance has been charged with murder gave birth to a daughter almost one year to the day after the death of her son.

Police say Joaquin Shadow Rams, 40, drowned his infant son Prince during an unsupervised visit in his Virginia home last October ordered by the court, despite Hera McLeod's protests.

McLeod, 33, chose to be a single mother to her second child; she does not know the father of her daughter, who was conceived via artificial insemination.

She says that being a single mother 
is far less terrifying than having to co-parent with a man she met on 
Match.com, a man who would eventually be charged with the murder of 
their child and who has now been charged with a further murder and is being 
investigated for a third.

After
the death of Prince, McLeod's friends and family were concerned she was
behaving irrationally out of grief, or trying to replace her beloved 
son by having another baby by herself.

McLeod told the Washington Post
that she knew she couldn’t stop being a mother, that she wanted another
child - but the idea of dating again or leaving her child's fate up to 
the authorities that so failed Prince filled her with horror.

'Though
I have lived through one of the worst tragedies I can imagine, part of 
honoring my son is knowing that I must also continue to choose love and 
happiness,' McLeod wrote on her blog Capuccino Queen after revealing the pregnancy.

'My decision to have my daughter was one of the first steps I took on my personal journey.'

McLeod's daughter Estela Annabelle McLeod was born October 30. The tiny girl is called a 'diva' by her mother and is doing well.

Rams
has pleaded not guilty in the death of Prince, who authorities say Rams
drowned on October 20, 2012 in an attempt to cash in on three separate 
life insurance policies he had taken out on Prince's life amounting to 
$560,000.

He 
has also been charged in the shooting death of his ex-girlfriend Shawn Katrina
Mason, the mother of his first son, who died in 2003. According to the Washington Post, he mistakenly 
believed he was the beneficiary of a life insurance policy on her life 
also.

McLeod met Rams through Match.com in February 2010.

'I
was approaching 30 and wondering if I would ever meet my soul-mate, or 
even if I had a soul-mate at all,' she told the Washington Post.

McLeod was initially put off by Rams' scruffy appearance but was soon charmed.

He
took her to lunch, sang to her and told her how he had been left to 
raise his son after the death of the child's mother in an accident.

McLeod would discover much later that
in fact, Rams' ex-girlfriend Shawn Mason had been shot in the face and 
that Rams himself was a prime suspect.

Rams told McLeod that after many bad dates, he was hoping to meet someone and settle down.

He
also claimed he owned a successful software consulting firm, and was an
aspiring R 'n' B singer who had interest from major labels. Rams also 
shaved five years off his actual age.

But McLeod was taken in - he drove an expensive car, lived in a large home and never seemed to be short of money.

McLeod,
who has a Masters degree in special education and works as an 
intelligence analyst for a defense contractor, fell pregnant by accident
and two months later Rams proposed to her.

He
and his pre-teen son had been drawn into the family by McLeod, and 
though her mother wasn't enamored of Rams, she didn't want to alienate 
her daughter, who seemed so happy and in love.

Mary
McLeod told the Washington Post that 'one always has to be careful 
about what one says about the person their child has fallen in love 
with.'

McLeod said that things began to go downhill after she became engaged to Rams and moved into his home.

He
complained about bills but he never seemed to work. His musical career was non-existent and he was charged after his son told a school 
counselor that his father hit him.

The charges were eventually dismissed and McLeod put it down to the boy being angry with his father and trying to get revenge.

'I had grown up with a mother and father who had been married for longer than I was alive and who would stay married until the day one of them dies,' she told the Washington Post.

'I hung on because I didn’t want to admit that this man was not the family man I had dreamed of. I guess I was afraid of losing that dream. I guess I was afraid of raising a baby myself.'

When Prince was born in July 2011, McLeod was overjoyed. But two weeks later, her parents arrived on her doorstep with an unthinkable allegation: Rams had raped her 19-year-old sister.

Charges against Rams in that case were dismissed but the Prince William police department is reviewing its handling of the case.

It was enough for McLeod. She fled the house with her son. It was only during the ensuing custody battle that McLeod discovered Rams was a suspect in the death of Shawn Mason.

She also discovered he was literally not who he said he was: Rams changed his name from John Ramirez in 2002.

His only income was social security and the money he received in insurance after the death of his mother.

The Washington Post reports that a Prince William social worker noted after the death of Shawn Mason: 'This worker has never interviewed anyone like Mr. Rams. It is not known if Mr. Rams’ stories are real to him or if he is just attempting to impress, but he clearly does not exhibit normal behavior.'

The Washington Post reports that Rams was a suspect in the death a decade ago - and yet he was still able to gain unsupervised visits with his son. He was indicted on murder and other charges in the case of Shawn Mason in November.

The final murder Rams is implicated in is that of his own mother, whose death by suffocation in a plastic bag was originally deemed suicide. The case has since been reopened.

In a statement released in May, Rams 
denied killing Prince: 'I did not harm my son. It breaks my heart to 
think that anyone would believe that I did. I’m still shocked to learn 
how sick he was.'

McLeod
is using her tragedy to try to change the system that she feels failed 
utterly to do its job: Protect her baby son. She has spoken at a 
Congressional briefing on 'Protecting Abused Children of Divorce and 
Separation' and writes extensively on the topic on her blog.

Rams'
guilt or innocence has yet to be established by a court, but with a 
long list of suspicious behavior, including an arrest for beating his 
older son, an accusation of rape by McLeod's own younger sister, lies 
about his age, producing pornography in his home and being a prime 
suspect in the shooting death of his former lover, that any court could 
allow unsupervised visits beggars belief.

The Montgomery Circuit Court judfge Michael Algeo said there was no evidence, only implication of Rams' illegal activity which was all 'a lot of smoke.'

McLeod was awarded sole custody of Prince, and Rams was given weekly supervised visits. But after a psychologist testified that Rams was fit to look after his child, he was allowed unsupervised visits.

On the fourth visit, Prince died.

According to the Washington Post, when the baby was brought into the hospital, staff notified Child Protective Services citing 'obvious unexplainable injuries.'

An autopsy discovered 'small bruises and abrasions on the face and upper chest and back' and 'fluid in the sinuses, airways, lungs and intestines.' He was found to have died by drowning.

McLeod's decision to have a baby as a single mother was made so that a judge will never have the power to make her hand over her child, against every maternal instinct that she has, to someone who might harm her.
