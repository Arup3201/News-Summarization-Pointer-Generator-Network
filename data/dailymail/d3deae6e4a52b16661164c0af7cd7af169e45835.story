Video of an 8-year-old girl's heartbreaking account of being bullied has gone viral, garnering more than 22,000 views in just a 24-hour period.

Sarah Cymbaluk filmed her daughter Anna's testimony after getting frustrated with the inaction of administrators at Magelsson Elementary School in Fosston, Minnesota.

Now, the third-grader is hoping to leverage the outpouring of support for the video to raise awareness of bullying across the U.S.

Targeted: Anna Cymbaluk, 8, talks about being bullied in a video that was posted on Facebook last week and has since gone viral

Mrs Cymbaluk first posted the video on her Facebook page last week, and Anna is so traumatized from the bullying that she refuses to talk about specifics of the attacks.

Instead, mom asks Anna how she feels about being targeted by bullies.

'It makes me feel sad and scared and I don't like it,' the little girl says.

Her little brother Benjamin, 7, also appears in the video with stories of his own.

He claims bullies told him he was going to commit suicide, and have called him both a 'son of a b****' and a 'motherf****.

More abuse: Anna's brother Benjamin (pictured together on the left) also appears in the video and talks about how bullies have called him a 'son of a b****' and a 'motherf*****'

In the video, Anna says she's reported the abuse to the principal about five times and has been told to 'just ignore it'.

But she thinks the kids behind the attacks should get suspended.

'It hurts my feelings,' she says. 'I want to feel like I'm wanted in school and people like me.'

Mrs Cymbaluk told WDAZ her daughter has been called the f-word and a lesbian and that the abuse has even become physical as Anna has come home with scratches and bruises.

School officials finally took the reports seriously after Mrs Cymbaluk posted the video on Facebook last week and it immediately swept the internet.  

Addressing the issue: Sarah and Jon Cymbaluk had a meeting with school administrators after posting the video last week and demanded a written apology

Mrs Cymbaluk and her husband Jon met with the school superintendent, principal and a school board member on Thursday, but don't think the meeting went well.

The parents say the first thing one of the officials said was 'What are you going to do to make us look good.'

The Cymbaluks demanded a written apology at the meeting, which officials agreed to.

However, Superintendent Mark Nohner says he wasn't informed about the bullying until the video was was posted, despite the Cymbaluk's claims that they've been dealing with the school since December.

Unaware: School Superintendent Mark Nohner says he hadn't heard about the bullying until last week, but is now doing everything in his power to make Anna feel safe

'I found out about the situation a couple of days ago and I think it could have been resolved without going to Facebook,' Mr Nohner told KXJB.

Mr Nohner says they are now doing everything to make Anna feel safe, and have since spoken with her bus driver.

Little Anna is now hoping to help other kids who have been the victim of bullying by organizing an awareness event.

Her 9th birthday is on Tuesday and she is asking everyone to wear orange, her favorite color, to honor 'ANYONE in ANY SITUATION who has been bullied' so that they know they are not alone, according to Facebook.
