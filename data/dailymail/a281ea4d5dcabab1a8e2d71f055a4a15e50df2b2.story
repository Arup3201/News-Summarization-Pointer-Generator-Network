A new study has found that lowering the hemlines on school uniforms could reduce the risk of skin cancer.

The research, which comes from James Cook University in Queensland, found that increasing the average uniform covering to the knees and elbows could increase sun protection by over 9 per cent.

The study included 100 schools in northern Queensland, and found that most schools had uniforms that only covered a small portion of the upper leg and arms, reports ABC.

Katie Clift, a spokesperson for Queensland Cancer, said the alterations 'don't require a re-design of the uniform, just small alterations or choosing loose-fitting garments, so it's a big gain for a little effort. 

The study also found that students from educationally poor schools wore less protecting school uniforms. 

Queensland currently has the highest rates of skin cancer in the world, with 3000 melanoma and 133,000 non-melanoma skin cancers diagnosed across the state yearly.

One school, Magnetic Island State School, has restyled its uniforms to abide by the study. 

Ms Clift, is encouraging other schools to follow in the steps of Magnetic Island.

'Children spend most of their week in a school environment during peak UV times, and we need to ensure they have the best protection against skin damage and skin cancer,' Ms Clift told ABC.
