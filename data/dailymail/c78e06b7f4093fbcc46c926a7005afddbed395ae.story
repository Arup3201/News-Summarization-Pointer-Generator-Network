Rafael Nadal is due to resume full training at the beginning of next month and will embark on a full schedule at the start of next year.

The 14-time Grand Slam winner is waiting for stitches to be removed from his recent appendix operation before going back into training having cut short his season and missed last week's Barclays ATP World Tour Finals.

He also confirmed the public statement from his doctor earlier this month that he has been undergoing stem cell treatment to treat his back.

Rafael Nadal spoke to the media at a Poker Stars event in central London on Tuesday night 

Despite Nadal's omission from the star names at the O2 last week, he was still in the minds of many fans

The procedure, which involves taking cells from the body and injecting them to try and repair damaged cartilage, is legal and has been used most often to help players in American Football.

Nadal admitted that his back has become a concern, and not just during January's Australian Open, where it affected him in the final.

'This year I had periods with problems in my back,' said Nadal, who was in London on Tuesday night for an event with his sponsors Poker Stars. 'I hope I will have had time enough to fix my back one hundred per cent again.'

His first tournament will be an exhibition in Abu Dhabi and after that he will play the ATP event in Doha before heading to the Australian Open.

'Of course I won't be able to train fully immediately, but I would expect to have a month when I can practice 100 per cent before my first big event.'

The 28 year-old Spaniard did not wish to become embroiled in the controversy affecting Roger Federer and Stanislas Wawrinka at the 02 Arena. However, he felt it was 'one of the strangest tournaments there has been. So many one-sided matches, normally when you get the top eight players it should be close.'

Federer failed to train on Tuesday ahead of Friday's start to the Davis Cup final in Lille but was hopeful of getting on court on Wednesday morning.
