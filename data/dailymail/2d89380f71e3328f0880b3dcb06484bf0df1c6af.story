Southampton have ditched their recent look and have gone back to tradition after unveiling their new home kit for the 2014/15 season.

Saints released their latest strip on Friday which features the club's familiar red and white stripes.

Accompanied with the slogan 'the stripes 
are back,' Southampton trio Jay Rodgriguez, Jose Fonte and James 
Ward-Prowse can be seen modelling the south coast outfit's latest kit 
which celebrates the club's long and rich heritage.

The red and white stripped-jersey features a red v-neck collar and sleeves with black shorts.

Completing the design fans can expect to see Ronald Koeman's side out on the pitch in red socks with black hoops.

The kit is in stark contrast to the club's previous releases from the past two seasons where the stripes were vacated for an unfamiliar all red ensemble.

Last season's stripe-less look upset many fans, with one supporter writing on a forum: 'Red and white stripes is what Saints are associated with.

'It just won't look right. First time since I can remember that I won't be buying it.'

And another adding: 'For me there is nothing to like about the home kit and it has nothing to do with our traditional home colours.'

The St. Mary's outfit away kit will revealed in the near future, the club have confirmed on their official website.

Breaking with tradition: Southampton's last two home kits for the 2012/13 (left) and 2013/14 (right) season were without their red and white stripes much to the frustration of many supporters
