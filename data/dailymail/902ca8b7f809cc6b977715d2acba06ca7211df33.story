A City banker has swapped the stock market for a share of the pop charts by ditching her job and releasing a raunchy rap song in which she sings: 'These playgirls look cute like cash'.

Russian Xenia Tchoumitcheva, 25, had seemed destined for a career as a high-flying banker after an internship at JP Morgan.

She had been offered roles at Merrill Lynch and Duet Group but instead decided to leave her day job behind and become a rap star.

She now spends her time hitting high notes instead of bonus targets and hopes to break into the UK charts with her tunes.

In her latest song 'You're So Beautiful' she gasps while delivering the lyrics to a heavy dance beat.

She sings: 'Sexy people look at me, beauty is my therapy. These playboys look cute like money.'These playgirls look cute like cash. Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the hottest of them all?'

Miss Tchoumitcheva said
that singing is more fun than working in banks and admits to having 
spent her days at work humming her favourite tunes while colleagues did 
trades worth millions.

She left the finance industry and did
a bit of work in television and modelling - but says that singing was 
always her true calling.

Miss Tchoumitcheva added: 'So Beautiful' is about passion and seduction. The text is very 
erotic, even provocative. It fits perfectly to the driving beats of 
house music.

'It still has to be the greatest feeling ever, when people dance to your own songs and have fun.'

Miss Tchoumitcheva, who has a degree in economics, said that started her career in finance through family connections.

She added: 'My grandfather was an 
entrepreneur and my grandmother ran a factory in Russia, so I grew up 
around finance and was always interested in it.

'I have to say that banking was a very positive experience for me - better than any other industry in the world.

'The financial system is like the blood of an organism. If there is a problem with an organ you can see it, because there is less, or more, supply.

'It is an alphabet to read the whole world, or an earthquake.'

A worker at JP Morgan said that Xenia 'brightened up the office' when she worked there.

The trader, who asked to remain anonymous, said: 'We all knew before Xenia arrived that she had done modelling, so there was a bit of excitement among the men.'

'Having her brighten up the testosterone fuelled office was a real treat. We'll all be listening with great interest to her erotic songs.'
