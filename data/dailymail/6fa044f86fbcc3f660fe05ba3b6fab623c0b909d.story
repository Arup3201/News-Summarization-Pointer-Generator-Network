They experienced grief most parents wouldn't dare to imagine, clutching six newborn babies as they died in their arms.

But Steve and Lindsey Justice have vowed to stay strong - and insist they still want to try for more children.

The college sweethearts still beam when they recall the moment a doctor said they were pregnant with sextuplets.

And despite enduring a loss of such magnitude just three weeks ago, they smile at the thought of parenting more children, whether biological or adopted.

Tragic: Lindsey and Steve Justice held all six of their babies, who were born at 21 weeks and died in their arms

Strong family: The couple had two daughters - four-year-old Hannah and two-year-old Hope - before falling pregnant with septuplets

Former NFL player: Steve was drafted by the Carolina Panthers before he and Lindsey set up their own gym

'We are still hopeful,' Lindsey told People. 

'We still want more kids. That could mean adoption, it could mean fertility drugs. We're taking it one day at a time.'

Former Carolina Panther Steve and his wife Lindsey already had two daughters - Hannah, four, and Hope, two - and dreamed of having a third before discovering that Lindsey had contracted an ovarian disease.

Finally, after a year of fertility treatments, the pregnancy test flashed pink. And a scan showed they were expecting seven girls.

He urged them to selectively abort some of them to give the rest a chance of reaching 23 weeks and a strong prospect of survival. But they refused.

However, at 12 weeks, Lindsey miscarried one.

Just 10 weeks later, on September 23, she felt contractions.

All six girls were born in ten minutes and within two hours had died in their parents' arms. 

And while they tried to cope with the grief themselves, they also had to find the words to explain the ordeal to their infant daughters.

'Hope still lifts up my shirt every day and says "baby?"' Lindsey told People. 'What do you tell her? The girls were so excited to have six little sisters.'

Now,  the couple has decided to speak out about their horrific ordeal as a sign of support to others who have gone through similar situations, and to show that they will move forward through their trauma.

'We don't have strength right now, we are broken, we are in deep mourning,' Lindsey told NBC.

'We held each one of our six girls and said goodbye to them.

Trauma: Lindsey had already miscarried a seventh fetus at 12 weeks before her waters broke at 21 weeks

'They were all living. They all have birth certificates, they all have a first name a middle name and a last name.'  

The couple, who live in Charlotte, North Carolina, met at Wake Forest college where Lindsey played soccer and Steve played football.

After marrying in 2009, they had two daughters - four-year-old Hannah and two-year-old Hope.

When they tried for a third, they discovered Lindsey had inherited PCOS, polycystic ovarian syndrome, which vastly reduces the chance of getting pregnant.

On Steve's birthday, Lindsey handed him a positive pregnancy test, NBC reported.

One trip to the doctor's surgery found there were at least six babies - and later it emerged there was a seventh.

No regrets: Lindsey recounted the birth to NBC but said she does not regret keeping all seven babies

He urged them to abort some. 

'Steve and I didn't even have to look at each other. That was just not going to be an option,' Lindsey said.

They were hit by tragedy in the 12th week when Lindsey miscarried. 

It was not until four weeks later that their doctor revealed yet another surprise: all six remaining babies were girls.

However, as they were still celebrating the news, Lindsey's waters broke.

'I started to feel some contractions and I wanted to not believe that,' she said. 

'What I would give to nurse them, to hold them, to rock them to sleep, to dress them. I want to be their mom, I want them to be here, you know. But that wasn't God's will.'

However, the couple maintain they do not regret their decision to keep all seven.

'I would do the past 21 weeks again and again and again if I had the choice,' Lindsey insists.
