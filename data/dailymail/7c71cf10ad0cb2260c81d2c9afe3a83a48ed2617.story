Selfies have become ubiquitous over the past few years, with everyone from pop stars to the president of the United States jumping on the bandwagon - but turns out the photo craze is at least a century old.

Writer and photograph Tom Byron has shared with the Internet community a handful of 'selfies' taken by his great-grandfather dating back to 1909.

Responding to a question about the best selfis on the social media site Quora late last month, Byron posted a trio of sepia-tone snapshots from the turn of the last century showing his ancestor, Joseph Byron Clayton, posing alone and with a group of friends while holding a bulky camera in his hands.

Unlike today's compact smartphones and slender tablets, taking a selfie a hundred years ago was a complicated task that required the photographer to hold a large, boxy apparatus in front of him.

The resulting images appeared disordered and out of proportion, similar to a reflection in a fun-house mirror.

In the prints aged by time, Mr Byron Clayton, a bespectacled, moustachioed gentleman, is depicted smiling for the camera in his hand alongside his friends all dressed in impeccable suits and bowler hats, with a fedora or two thrown in the mix. 

Mr Byron, a retiree from Marietta, Georgia, explained on Quora that he comes from a long line of shutterbugs beginning with his great-great-grandfather, James Clayton, who opened his first photo studio in London in mid-1800s.

The history of the Byron family as it is laid out on Ancestry.com is a fascinating one. Born in 1802 in Nottingham, England, James Clayton started out as a small-time businessman running a successful basket making company with his wife.

Around 1857, he decided to open his first photography studio, possibly inspired by his younger brother, Walter, who got into the picture-taking business a year before.

When his son, Joseph Byron Clayton, was in his teens in the early 1860s, he joined his father as a studio assistant.

But a few years later, Joseph took a job with a London photographer by the name of Sanderson and later bought him out.

In the late 1860s, the budding entrepreneur was convicted of receiving stolen goods and sentenced to 12 months of hard labor.

Once freed, Byron Clayton resumed his career in photography and married a coal miner's daughter named Julia Lewin, who bore him six children.

By mid 1880s, Byron Claytonâ€™s company had fallen on hard times. Facing a possible bankruptcy, the businessman, his wife and oldest daughter picked up and immigrated to New York in hopes of a fresh start.  

For a year Byron Clayton practiced as a freelance press photographer for the Illustrated American, among other publications, before breaking into stage photography.

His son Percy followed in his footsteps, but eventually moved to Edmonton, Canada, where he established a photographic business with his brother-in-law.

Family trait: Tom Byron seemingly inherited from his great-grandfather not only a passion for photography, but also a penchant for facial hair

The family business faltered during World War I, forcing Percy to move back to New York, where he again joined forces with his father, establishing a studio specializing in ship photography. 

Joseph Byron Clayton died in 1923, after which Percy Byron took over the Byron Company and continued to run it successfully until the middle of World War II, when business experienced a downturn and the company closed for good in October 1942.

Tom Byron, a married father of three, who earned several college degrees in economics, followed in his ancestorsâ€™ footsteps, working as a photographer until 2010, when he retired.
