A lower league ice hockey team have become the first side to wear a 'selfie jersey' - with a collage of photos of their fans including on the wacky shirt.

The Columbus Cottonmouths debuted the top ahead of their Southern Professional Hockey League match against the Pensacola Ice Flyers but ended up falling to a 4-2 defeat. 

The design was created in honour of 'social media night' and the shirts were later sold in an auction. 

The Columbus Cottonmouths created the 'selfie jersey' as part of their social media day

Cottonmouth fans had been uploading their selfie entries on Twitter since October, using the hashtag #snakeselfie for a chance to be included in the one off shirt. 

Columbus play Pensacola again on Thursday but will be back in their normal strip and hopefully can get back to winning ways. 

The shirt didn't help the result as they were beaten 4-2 Pensacola Ice Flyers before they were auctioned
