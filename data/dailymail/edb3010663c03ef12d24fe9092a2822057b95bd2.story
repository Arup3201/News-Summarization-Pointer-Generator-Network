Ambrose Murray, 22, pictured outside Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court, stole his father's opiate painkillers to feed his drug habit

A former 'star pupil' who sold his father's super-strength prescription painkillers to feed his drug habit has been jailed after they killed a young partygoer.

Ambrose Murray, 22, stole opiate skin patches from his father John, who suffers from chronic back pain.

But when he sold the medicine at a house party near his home in Altrincham, Greater Manchester, 20-year-old Josh Makin swallowed a patch instead of putting it on his skin.

It gave him 150 times the standard dose, killing him overnight.

His girlfriend found him dead beside her the next afternoon.

Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court heard Josh was  drinking, taking drugs and playing a games console at a friend's house in the early hours of September 8 last year.

Meanwhile Murray was offering his father's patches, which he had been stealing for several months alongside other pills, to guests at a house party.

He wrote on Facebook: 'Does anyone there want to buy fents?'

Prosecutor Brian Berlyne said 'fents' referred to fentanyl, the active ingredient in the stolen painkillers.

When Josh, an office worker at a solicitors' firm from Sale, Greater Manchester, arrived at the party, he and a friend were handed the patches and told Murray they would pay him the next week.

Murray told Josh the drugs were strong painkillers which should be stuck to the skin, the court heard.

But after Murray had left, Josh put a packet of fentanyl on his tongue and swallowed it.

Murray was jailed for supplying drugs. The court heard his actions did not cause Josh Makin's death directly

A strong opioid medicine similar to morphine, fentanyl is used for treating chronic pain.

It is from the same basic  family as heroin and induces relaxation and euphoria.

Skin patches containing fentanyl are 
designed to be worn like a nicotine patch for 72 hours, releasing the 
drug slowly into the bloodstream.

It takes 12 hours for the full effects of the patch, often used for terminal illnesses, to wear off.

Several patients have claimed they became addicted to the drug.

Bob Rees, 53, from Pontypridd, Wales, told the media he went into 'cold turkey' after being weaned off fentanyl.

'I’m as addicted to pain medication as junkies are to heroin,' he said.

The court ruled that Murray's actions did not directly cause Josh's death because the 
opiates were swallowed, rather than used properly.

But he was jailed for 18 months for supplying class A drugs and theft.

Murray, wearing a grey suit and dark red tie, sobbed in the dock as the sentence was handed down.

Lisa Judge, defending, told the court Murray was top of his class in junior school, but struggled when he started at the local grammar.

Murray, of Dunham Road, Altrincham, had become addicted to drugs and started stealing painkillers from his father to fund his habit, it was heard.

But Judge Mushtaq Khokhar told the court: 'Drugs are a plague on this society'.

Josh’s mother, Louise, told the Manchester Evening News after the hearing: 'No sentence that the court could have passed would bring him back.

'We just want this to be a warning that when you experiment with drugs you are in the unknown.'
