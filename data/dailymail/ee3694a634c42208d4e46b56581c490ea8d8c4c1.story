Tragedy: Averil Hart starved herself to death

A gifted student died from anorexia at 19 after a string of failings by GPs and specialists.

Averil Hart was found collapsed  at her university flat by a cleaner after becoming so weak she could barely stand.

When she died it is thought her weight had dropped to below six stone.

Averil’s family say she was supposed to have been in the care of specialist medical staff, and should not have been allowed to starve herself to death.

They have also accused NHS bosses of altering her medical records after her death, possibly as part of a cover-up.

Averil first developed the illness at 17, while she was doing her A-levels. She  became so ill she was admitted to hospital and stayed there for ten months.

She recovered well and her parents agreed to let her go to the University of East Anglia in Norwich, not far from the family home in Colchester, Essex, to do a degree in English and creative writing.

Doctors reassured the family she would be closely monitored by GPs at the university as well as by a specialist eating disorders team.

But she was placed under the care of a junior trainee psychologist who had no experience of  anorexia, her parents claim.

Despite seeing her six times a week, he failed to realise she was rapidly losing weight.

By the time her father Nicholas, 55, and older sister Imogen, 27,  visited her one weekend last November she was so weak she slurred her words as if drunk.

They drove home in tears and made an emergency call to Averil’s previous doctor who promised to send one of the NHS specialists nearby to check on her.

But nothing was done and a few weeks later she was found unconscious. She slipped into a coma and died a few days later on December 15, 2012.

Her case is one of 14 highlighted by the Patients’ Association today in a report on poor NHS care.

The charity warned that, too often, the health service forgets that ‘care and compassion should be at the heart of what staff do’.

Averil’s mother Miranda, 54, told the 
Patients’ Association the family were promised the teenager would have 
weekly check-ups from an NHS psychologist and would be weighed, have her
 blood pressure checked and mental well-being assessed.

Yet she was left
 in the care of a junior psychologist who had no experience of eating 
disorders and weighed her only three times.

The family also discovered that a manager at the NHS’s Norfolk community eating disorders team made ‘additional notes’ on her file two weeks after her death which, they said, was ‘highly questionable’.

They have made a formal complaint to the NHS and are calling for an independent inquiry.

In another case, the family of Olive Burns, 84, were told she had been placed on the Liverpool Care Pathway when staff had in fact forgotten to treat her on a busy weekend.

She had been admitted to Tameside Hospital, Greater Manchester, with terminal lung cancer shortly before her death last year.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘The shocking cases in this report defy belief and make me all the more determined to make compassionate care the beginning, middle and end of everything the NHS does.’

The NHS trusts in charge of Averil’s care offered their ‘sincerest apologies’ and said a formal investigation had been launched.

A Tameside Hospital spokesman said: ‘On occasions in the past, the care we offered our patients did not meet the standards they rightly expected and for this we are truly sorry. We are now on a journey of improvement.’
