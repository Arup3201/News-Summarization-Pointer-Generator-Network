Animal-lovers have warned ‘never give a dog a bone’ after a pet died from being given a treat.

Burtie, a two-year-old miniature schnauzer, died after a bone splintered, causing fragments to rupture his stomach.

Within hours he became sick and was unable to walk.

Tragic: Bertie became sick within hours and was unable to walk. He was given painkillers in the hope he would pass the bones naturally, but his condition deteriorated and he had to be put to sleep

He was given painkillers in the hope he would pass the bones naturally, but his condition deteriorated and he had to be put to sleep.

Owner Anna Carey, 42, from Worthing, believes the problem was caused by a Bob Martin’s premium ham bone she bought from Tesco for £2.09.

She said: ‘My advice is “Don’t give a dog a dry bone” because they are more likely to splinter. We are so sad; it’s been such a shock.

‘I don’t think a product like that should be on sale. I don’t want any other pet owner to go through what we did, watching our dog suffer such agonising pain.’

Action: Tesco (store in Hove, where the bone was bought, pictured) has withdrawn the bone from sale and Bob Martin is reviewing the future of the item

Tesco has withdrawn the bone from sale and Bob Martin is reviewing the future of the item. It paid Anna £2,300 to cover vet’s costs but didn’t accept liability.

A Bob Martin spokesman said: ‘We are looking at the packaging as consumers don’t understand the risks of giving a pet a natural product.’

Tesco said: ‘We’ve taken this item off our shelves while an urgent review is carried out.’
