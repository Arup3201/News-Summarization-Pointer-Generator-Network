The Atlanta teen initially denied a place on the nation's heart transplant waiting list because of the vague reason of 'non-compliance', has finally received a new heart.

Diagnosed with an enlarged heart and given six months to live, Anthony Stokes, 15, and his family had labeled Children's Healthcare of Atlanta's seemingly arbitrary decision as a 'death sentence'.

Stokes underwent surgery on Tuesday evening, just 10 days after his family complained publicly that he 
was unfairly rejected because of past failure to take 
medicine and show up for doctors' appointments.

Civil rights groups became involved with
 the case last week and Stokes' mother Melencia Hamilton gave several 
emotional interviews to Atlanta television stations.

A few days later, the hospital reversed course and added Stokes, who suffered from a weakened, enlarged heart that couldn't pump blood efficiently, to its waiting list.

Stokes is currently recovering in the intensive care unit of 
Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Wednesday, reports the 
Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Citing
 patient privacy, the hospital would not release further details of the 
case but said it has performed 10 heart transplants so far this year, 
three in the past week.

Relief: Melencia Hamilton, Anthony Stokes' mother has said that she will ensure her son complies with all necessary medications needed to allow the transplant to take

While
 a history of non-compliance could mean doctors were worried that Stokes
 would not take medication to ensure a successful transplant, his family
 said the truth was that Anthony's low grades at school and a brush with
 the law meant the hospital initially refused him the surgery.

After the hospital has changed its mind, Hamilton assured ABC News that her son would follow every instruction needed to ensure a succesful transplant.

'I know he will comply with all the rules,' said a crying Melencia Hamilton. 'He will take his medicine because he knows that is how he has to live.'

Previously sentenced to a period of house arrest following a brawl to protect his younger brother, Stokes was admitted to hospital with his ankle bracelet still attached.

'He was just fighting,' Hamilton said. 'Trying to take up, just trying to take up for his brother because somebody was bullying his brother.'

Denied: Anthony Stokes had had a brush with the law - which his family felt was at least part of the reason why he was initially denied a heart transplant

Illness: Stokes was diagnosed with a heart complaint in July and desperately needed a heart transplant

Last year 319 people on the 
transplant list did not survive long enough to receive a new organ and 
currently there are nine children on the list.

'He's
 been given a death sentence because of a broad and vague excuse of 
noncompliance. There was nothing specific in that decision. Just 
noncompliance,' said Christine Young Brown of Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference, prior to the hospital changing its mind.

Previously healthy, Anthony only discovered last month that his heart was failing.

Despite
 specialists informing Anthony and his family that he has less than a 
year to live, they also sent them a letter on August 7, explaining why 
he wouldn't be put on the transplant list.

'The decision was made that Anthony is currently not a transplant candidate due to having a history of non-compliance, which is one of our center’s contraindications to listing for heart transplant,' explained the devastating letter.

Diagnosis: Anthony Stokes was given just six months to live if he didn't get the heart transplant

'As we discussed today with Anthony’s 
mother, we will not place Anthony on the heart transplant waiting list 
at this time due to this decision,' the letter continued.

The hospital initially refuted any claims of mismanagement in a statement in which they repeat their claims of careful management of the transplant list.

'The well-being of our patients is always our first priority. We are continuing to work with this family and looking at all options regarding this patient's health care,' said Children's Healthcare of Atlanta spokeswoman Patty Gregory.

'We follow very specific criteria in determining eligibility for a transplant of any kind.'

Anthony's mother described earlier this week the moment she was told by the hospital her son would not be getting the transplant he needs to live.

'Doctor came in and said he's not a candidate. He's not a candidate for a heart transplant,' said Hamilton.

Family members said that the hospital explained that they fear that Anthony won't follow the strict plan of medication and follow-up treatments necessary for the transplant to succeed.

It is not clear what evidence of 'non-compliance' the hospital is basing their decision on.

'We must save Anthony's life. We don't have a lot of time to do it, but it's something that must be done,' said Mack Major, Stokes' mentor.
