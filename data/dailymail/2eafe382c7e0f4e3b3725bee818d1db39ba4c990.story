Injured Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard will watch his side take on Besiktas in the final 32 of the Europa League as a pundit for ITV, and it could be a good sign for his team.

Brendan Rodgers' side will undoubtedly miss Gerrard's experience in Europe but when the Liverpool midfielder was a Sky Sports pundit for his team's game against Tottenham at White Hart Lane  last season, they won 5-0.

Gerrard was ruled out that day with a hamstring problem and the same injury means he will miss out on Thursday.

The last time Liverpool played Besiktas at Anfield, they won 8-0 and Gerrard (second right) scored

The former England captain has appeared as an ITV pundit before, notably for the 2014 Champions League final between Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid.

Gerrard will be joined by Peter Reid, Gordon Strachan and Matt Smith as Liverpool play their first leg against Slaven Bilic's side at Anfield. 

The last time the two sides met in England, Liverpool thrashed the Turkish side 8-0 in 2007.

Gerrard scored that night but now will have to hope his team-mates can produce a similarly emphatic result ahead of the return leg next week.

The return fixture against Besiktas will see Liverpool return to the scene of their 2005 Champions League win

But while away games against Turkish sides traditionally produce a fearsome atmosphere, Gerrard has extra motivation to feature next Thursday.

The second leg will be played at the Ataturk Staidum in Istanbul, the scene of Liverpool's 2005 Champions League victory over AC Milan.
