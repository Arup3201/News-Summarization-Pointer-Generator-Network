The BBC was forced to apologise to the Chief Rabbi for ‘ambushing’ him into making unguarded comments about the Gaza crisis when he believed he was off-air.

Jonathan Sacks, who had just completed his regular ‘Thought for the Day’ slot on Radio 4’s Today  Programme, was asked by presenter Evan Davis for ‘any thoughts’ on the latest Middle East clashes.

The Jewish leader sighed loudly and said: ‘I think it’s got to do with Iran actually’, when co-presenter Sarah Montague interrupted him to whisper ‘We’re live’.

Lord Sacks then markedly changed tone
 and issued a plea for a ‘continued prayer for peace, not only in Gaza 
but the whole region’.

He added: ‘No one gains from 
violence, not the Palestinians, not the Israelis’. Twitter users 
described the question as an ‘ambush’. BBC sources said the Chief Rabbi 
was angry and made his views clear to the Today production team. The BBC
 said Davis had apologised. 

A spokesman said: ‘The Chief Rabbi hadn’t realised he was still on air and as soon as this became apparent, we interjected.

‘Evan likes to be spontaneous with 
guests, but he accepts that in this case it was inappropriate and he has
 apologised to Lord Sacks. The BBC would reiterate that apology.’

Twitter was soon awash with his remarks as users both mocked and questioned him - while some claimed that Davis had 'ambushed' the Rabbi unfairly.

 user @SimonSiThornton wrote: 'Too bad though, I would have loved to 
have heard Chief Rabbi Sacks attempt to explain how Israel's attack was 
'to do with of Iran.'

‏'Just hoping you could kindly expand on your comment about Iran being to blame for Gaza on,' wrote @ourmaniniran. 

In an official response to the 
conflict, Lord Sacks yesterday supported Israeli’s right to defend 
themselves against rockets fired from the Palestinian territories. He 
said: ‘In the past week alone over 275 rockets have been fired into 
southern Israel from Gaza.

‘No nation on earth can be expected to live under this constant threat to innocent life.

‘The people of Israel are entitled, 
as is any other nation, to live in peace and safety. We mourn with all 
the bereaved families, and pray for an end to the hostilities from which
 both sides suffer.’

The Palestinian Islamist movement 
Hamas is a long-term ally of Iran, and is thought to receive tens of 
millions of dollars in funding from the Iranian regime.

However, there have been tensions in recent months over Iran’s backing of the brutal Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad.

The BBC's apology is the second issued by the corporation in a week. It made an apology 
to Lord McAlpine six days ago after wrongly implicating him in a child 
sex abuse ring in a Bryn Estyn childrens' home near Wrexham, north 
Wales.
