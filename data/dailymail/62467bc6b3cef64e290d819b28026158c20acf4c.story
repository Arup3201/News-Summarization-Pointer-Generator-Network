Just two years after Holly Golightly's iconic townhouse at 169 East 71st St sold for $5.97million, it is back on the market - for nearly double the price.

The 3,800-square-foot Manhattan brownstone made famous 
by the Audrey Hepburn film Breakfast at Tiffany's is now on sale for $10million.

The four-story house, which is divided into two duplex units but can be converted into a four-bedroom, five-bathroom home, was bought by Cyprus-based Costalea Holdings Limited in April 2012 after serving as a hideout for 11 years to former Merrill Lynch broker Peter E Bacanovic, who originally purchased the property 
for $1.8million in 2000.

Landmark: The building's exterior was used for the film, and interiors were shot at a sound stage in California

Mr Baconovic is well known for the five months he spent in prison as part of the Martha Stewart insider trading scandal, and sold the house because 'it was time for a change,' he told The New York Times in 2012.

The 15-foot-wide Upper East Side townhouse figured prominently in the 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany's.

The house served as the backdrop for the movie's famous exterior shots, however most of inside scenes, where Miss Golightly hosted her wild soirees and lived alongside Paul Varjak, the aspiring writer played by George Peppard, were filmed in a Hollywood studio.

However, Robert Browne, Mr Baconovicâ€™s broker at Corcoran, told The New York The Times he is convinced that the party where Miss Golighty wore a bed sheet was filmed in the living room.

Good investment: Peter Bacanovic, best known as the Merrill Lynch broker who was embroiled in the Martha Stewart insider trading case, purchased the property in 2000 for $1.88million

Cozy: The home is currently separated into two duplex apartments

Warm: Mr Bacanovic said the residence could easily be converted into a single-family home with ten bedrooms

spotted in the movie. But many of its landmarks remain in place.

The top apartment features two bedrooms with en-suite baths and three fireplaces.

Downstairs, a lower apartment features two bedrooms, two fireplaces, a solarium and a large backyard.
