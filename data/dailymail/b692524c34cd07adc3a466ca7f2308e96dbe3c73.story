Off the hook: Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore escapes further disciplinary action

Under-fire football chief Richard Scudamore escaped the sack today despite the Prime Minister joining the backlash against his sexist emails.

David Cameron suggested a member of his Cabinet would not survive if they admitted sending crude messages, as the Premier League chief executive had done.

But tonight the Premier League announced ‘no further disciplinary action is required or justified’ for Scudamore, who earns a reported £2.5million. He has apologised for his actions.

Mr Cameron branded the messages ‘unacceptable’, echoing a chorus of outrage at the derogatory emails in which Scudamore called women ‘broads’ and made sexist jokes about ‘female irrationality’.

Asked if a minister would survive such a scandal, Mr Cameron told BBC Radio 5 Live: ‘No I don’t think they would.’ He added: ‘I haven’t actually seen the emails myself but obviously people should treat everybody else with respect.’

Scudamore sent the emails to male colleagues but they were leaked by his former PA, Rani Abraham, who said she was ‘humiliated, belittled and disgusted’ by their content.

England and Everton Ladies goalkeeper Rachel Brown-Finnis branded Scudamore's comments an 'insult to all women' and 'negative'.

She added: 'I was really disappointed. I wouldn't say I was massively shocked.

'These sorts of judgements and behaviours are not acceptable, not just in the Premier League but across the whole country.'

A meeting of the Premier League’s 17 members had been scheduled to decide Scudamore’s fate.

Instead a meeting, chaired by McCormick, took place at their Gloucester Place offices.

McCormick had carried out an investigation in conjunction with law firm Harbottle & Lewis, specifically appointed for this. The Premier League investigation found no evidence of a wider discriminatory attitude or inappropriate language.

In a statement afterwards, Premier League acting chairman Peter McCormick said that football clubs had accepted Scudamore’s ‘sincere’ apology and ‘accepted his undertaking to take active steps to prevent a recurrence’.

England and Everton Ladies goalkeeper Rachel Brown-Finnis says the comments from someone of Scudamore's stature in the game are 'disappointing'

The statement added: ‘In these 
circumstances and in the light of a previously unblemished record over 
15 years of service to the Premier League, the clubs resolved 
unanimously that no further disciplinary action is required or 
justified.’

Miss Abraham, 41, said today: ‘I’m delighted that David Cameron has supported my view that Mr Scudamore’s emails were unacceptable. I think it shows what an important and serious matter it is.’

But she added: ‘I can’t understand how the Premier League can claim their investigation is “rigorous” when they have never asked to interview me for my views or experience.

‘Surely, as the person who felt they had no choice but to blow the whistle on what was happening, I should have been their first port of call.’

Scudamore said in a statement he felt sincere contrition over the emails.

He said: 'Entering into email exchanges of this nature was wrong and the apology I have made is sincere, as is the contrition I feel.

'These exchanges do not reflect my views towards women in football, the workplace or in general. It is something that will never be repeated.

'The Premier League shareholders have considered and deliberated this matter and I fully accept and respect their recommendations and conclusions.

'I appreciate that I have a tremendous amount of hard work to do to convince those in the game who do not know me that my leadership and work in the areas of equality and discrimination to date reflect who I am and what I believe.

'So, I will now undertake meetings and discussions with a wide range of stakeholders in the game to hear their views and to reassure them that I will continue to do my utmost personally, and through all the Premier League's means to help promote diversity and inclusion, develop the women's game and support women who want be involved in football at any level.

'I am grateful for the support I have received throughout this from family, friends and colleagues, but especially the women who work with me at the Premier League.'

Speaking on Good Morning Britain, Miss Abraham said of the emails: ‘They were sexist - very, very degrading to women.’

Asked what she thought should happen to Scudamore, she said: ‘I feel he should resign’ - and if he did not, then he should be asked to leave.’

Football Association chairman Greg Dyke has described Scudamore’s remarks as ‘totally inappropriate’ while Sports Minister Helen Grant branded them ‘unacceptable’.

Lord Herman Ouseley, chairman of anti-discrimination campaign group Kick It Out, said today: ‘The top of the football pyramid is still a bastion of white male domination. It will be a long road to achieve equality outcomes.

'No one is ever inclined to give up power, and facing up to culture change can be painful.’

The Football Association’s independent board member Heather Rabbatts will chair a meeting tomorrow. She has already said Scudamore should consider his position in light of ‘growing evidence of a closed culture of sexism’ at the Premier League.

Sky Sports presenters Richard Keys (above, right) and Andy Gray (left) exited Sky in 2011 after being caught on tape making sexist comments off-air.

Gray was sacked by Sky in January 2011 after he and Keys were heard on air making derogatory remarks about female assistant referee Sian Massey prior to a Premier League match between Wolverhampton and Liverpool.

Believing their microphones were off, Gray said: ‘Can you believe that? A female linesman. Women don’t know the offside rule.’

Keys replied: ‘Course they don’t.’ Both were banned before further footage emerged of Gray making an inappropriate comment to Sky Sports presenter Charlotte Jackson off air at the Sky studios.

Gray’s contract was immediately terminated by Sky Sports' managing director Barney Francis for unacceptable behaviour, while Keys resigned soon after.

Keys also went on to remark on comments made by Karren Brady in the Sun on Saturday morning about the level of sexism in football by saying: 'See charming Karren Brady this morning complaining about sexism? Yeah. Do me a favour, love.'

An earlier version of this article said that the audit and remuneration committee had been scheduled to decide Scudamore's case. In fact, it was the Premier League's 17 clubs who met with Richard Scudamore. We are happy to clarify this.
