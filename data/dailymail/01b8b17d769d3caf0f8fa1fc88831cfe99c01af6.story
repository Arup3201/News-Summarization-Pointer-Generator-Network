Smith allegedly admitted to police that one of the two victims said no then added, 'Yeah, but I thought she was saying 'no' for pleasure and not to stop having sex.'

He did not consent to interview requests.

Smith has pled not guilty and will be back in court on Oct. 27.

His trial is set for December 2. 

Though school officials have said he has a right to play and his attorney has told reporters Smith is 'innocent until proven guilty,' he believes the charges are too much for the team to deal with. 

Smith allegedly admitted to police that one of the two victims said no then added, 'Yeah, but I thought she was saying 'no' for pleasure and not to stop having sex.'

'He's not going to play for the rest of the year,' his attorney, Scott Campbell, told ABC News. 'You show up at practice, there's a news truck there. It's something he and his family decided.'

Campbell added: 'He felt like it was a distraction for his team and the school and he didn't want that.'

Students and parents alike have expressed outrage over the school's decision to let Smith continue as defensive tackle.

Hoquiam School District Superintendent Mike Parker said he backed the coach's decision.

'We felt that he's innocent until proven guilty,' Parker told KOMO. 'As bad as the crime might be, as repulsive as the crime might be, we're trusting that the court system will sort that out for us.'
