NatWest have finally fixed the computer meltdown which led to millions of their bank customers being unable to access their money for the past three days.

The bank issued a statement this afternoon announcing they had solved the 'initial problem' and were working 'round the clock' to clear the backlog which is expected to continue into next week.

Customers have been left unable to pay 
bills, do their grocery shopping or make essential transfers since 
Wednesday as a result of IT problems.

Apologising to all their customers for 
the technical glitch, the bank said:' We appreciate this has caused 
an unacceptable level of inconvenience.

'We have fixed the initial problem and our priority has been to work round the clock to sort the backlog as soon as possible.'

Today over 900 branches extended their opening hours until 6pm and will be open from 9am until Noon tomorrow to handle emergencies.

NatWest - owned by taxpayer-funded RBS - admitted the breakdown resulted in money credited to customers accounts overnight not appearing in their balances 'as it should'.

In some cases people were left homeless after the computer problems meant house purchases fell through.

Others
were stranded abroad, unable to access funds which should have been in 
their account. Angry customers said the bank's response was not good enough, with some vowing to take their business away as a result of the chaos.

How it could affect you

The problem arose after staff tried to install a software update on RBS’s payment processing system, but ended up corrupting it.

When checking their accounts on 
Wednesday many customers found their balances had not updated properly 
to show new payments in. This meant those relying on wages being paid in
were unable to pay their mortgage and other bills.

Three days later, many of those 
payments have still not appeared – meaning thousands of customers are 
now likely to have been hit by penalty charges for missing the payments.

Although the banking group has 
promised that no one will be out of pocket as a result of the problems, 
it may take weeks to clear the backlog of claims.

The problems have hit 7.5million personal customers, many business customers and 100,000 customers of Ulster Bank.

Messaging boards were flooded 
yesterday with complaints from those who were unable to access wages or 
who had their cards declined in shops.

Lance King and his family were left homeless after the problems at NatWest caused their house purchase to fall through.

He and wife Gemma had sold their 
previous property, but could not move into their new one because IT 
problems meant the money for the sale had failed to appear.

Last night they and their two daughters, aged one and five, were forced to stay with Mrs King’s parents.

‘It is a complete nightmare,’ said Mr King, 34, from Whiteley, Hampshire.

‘We had a removal van outside the 
house waiting to get in but because the money was in a NatWest account, 
we couldn’t complete the sale.

‘All of our stuff is now in storage and my wife and two children are living with my in-laws. The stress has been horrendous.’

Although he is not a NatWest customer, Mr King’s move was brought to a halt because his solicitor’s account is with NatWest.

‘For a big corporate bank it is just unbelievable,’ he added.

Also hit by the problem were first-time buyers Mike Johnson and his pregnant wife Laura.

Logged off: NatWest posted a message to customers on its website this afternoon, explaining that the problems remained unresolved

First-time buyer Milley Colley, 27, was unable to move into her new two-bedroom flat yesterday because NatWest had not transferred the money.

She attempted to send the funds to her solicitor - two days before the problems officially begun - but they never arrived.

The freelance photographer was supposed to move into a property in Bow, east London, but is still in her parents home in Teddington, south-west London, while she waits for the bank to deal with the problem.

'The completion date was yesterday 
but NatWest have been having problems since Tuesday. I went into a 
branch to do a same day payment to my solicitor but that payment never 
arrived,' she said.

'I phoned NatWest and the person told
me it had arrived and there was no problem. The money left my bank 
immediately on Tuesday but has still not arrived.

'Then yesterday they said they did not know where the money had gone.

'I have got all my stuff packed up and I had taken the day off working yesterday and I was ready to go.'

She is moving into the flat on her 
own and has funded the purchase through a private family loan. Two other
people in the chain are believed to be affected.

Meanwhile, student Kora-Lee Holmes, 21, was stranded in Venice, Italy, unable to pay her hotel for the stay because her bank card was not working.

She missed her flight home while she 
battled to make the payment so her father Adrian was forced to spend 
£200 to re-book her on another one last night.

The Hull University student said: 'I 
tried paying the hotel with my NatWest Visa debit card but it didn't 
work and when I got on my online banking I was unable to transfer any 
money.

'I was trying to get the money paid 
while all the time the clock was ticking down to when my flight took 
off. I tried phoning NatWest but there was a 45 minute queue.

'I just got the standard response on 
the website about a temporary problem with the site and that was at 
8.30am Italian time. This didn't help me.'

She was flying back to Newcastle instead of Manchester because it was the only flight available.

Anger: NatWest allowed customers to post their 'feedback' on their website - and people were using it to record their disgust

Helpful banking: A message on the NatWest sight warns that they are currently experiencing technical difficulties

As NatWest battled to get their computer systems up and running again, they allowed customers to post their 'ideas' directly onto their homepage.

Irate customers unable to get hold of their money had a few comments Here are some of them:

'All systems gone on strike until RBS/NatWest receive another bailout from the taxpayer' - lollollol

'Account updated now but money is missing! Basically been called a liar on the phone by "helpful" staff. I'm going up there now ...' - BeyondAngry

The couple were thrown out of a house
they thought they had paid for on Thursday after the problems at 
NatWest meant the payment did not go through as expected.

The Johnsons had been allowed access 
to the newly-built property after transferring the money to their 
solicitor’s NatWest client account on Monday. But the balance still 
hadn’t arrived on Thursday – so that evening the site manager arrived at
their house and asked them to leave.

‘We had to pack our bags then and there and we are now living with our sister-in-law until this is sorted out,’ Mr Johnson said.

Mark Groom, of Groom Halliday 
Property Solicitors, said: ‘If we can’t see the money - whether or not 
it is actually there - a property sale simply cannot complete. Because 
so many completions occur on Fridays, the numbers affected will be 
huge.’

A NatWest spokesman said:' Staff in our branches are ready and available to answer any customer questions and help with emergency needs.'
