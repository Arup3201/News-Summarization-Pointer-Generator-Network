Christine Lee Brown loved the bologna sandwiches in Palm Bay jail  so much she just had to call 911 to thank the staff.

And now after being arrested and charged with six felony counts of misusing the emergency phone number it looks like she'll have the chance to eat one again very soon.

Florida dispatchers alerted police to at least half a dozen calls from Brown's residence Saturday.

Christine Lee Brown called 911 six times to thank the sheriff for giving her bologna sandwiches the last time she was arrested

'The last time I was arrested, the sheriff gave me his bologna 
sandwiches...I remember them,' Brown said, occasionally slurring her 
words as she talked with dispatchers at Palm Bay Police Department.

All of her calls were recorded, as is policy for 911 emergency calls.

Dispatchers
repeatedly asked if she had an emergency with each call, but 
all Brown wanted to talk about was food.

'Do you have an emergency,' an exasperated operator asked at one point.

'No...' Brown responded.

Bologna: The Florida jails fine cuisine included beans and rice

Brown then went on to ask about the jail's kitchen, baked beans, and rice.

That kitchen serves an estimated 1,600 inmates, which now includes Brown.

The arresting officer can be heard knocking on the door at one point.

Brown went to talk to him through the window still chatting with emergency dispatchers.

She remained held late Tuesday on a $3,000 bond at the Brevard County Jail Complex, which is overseen by the sheriff’s office.
