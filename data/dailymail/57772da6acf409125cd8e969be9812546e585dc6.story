Suspicions: Head football coach Todd Hoffner, 46, was arrested on allegations that he had possessed and produced child pornography

A university football coach facing child pornography charges took the stand yesterday and vehemently denied that cellphone videos he shot of his naked children in the summer were 'inappropriate' and said they were just family fun.

Speaking publicly for the first time since his August arrest, Minnesota State University, Mankato coach Todd Hoffner, 46, asked a Blue Earth County district judge to dismiss the charges, arguing that he should have never been arrested.

'There was nothing inappropriate about any of these videos,' he said of footage a technician found on his school-issued cellphone when he took it to the campus IT department after it malfunctioned. The three videos showed his children - aged five to nine years old - dancing around naked and touching their private parts.

The coach's testimony came near the end of a three-hour hearing in which his attorney, Jim Fleming, pressed investigators about whether they thought the videos were, in fact, pornographic when they first saw them. Some said they found the images 'disturbing' while others said they needed more context, according to the Star Tribune.

Both Fleming and Hoffner's wife have publicly rejected the charges as ridiculous, saying the videos simply captured the family's children being silly.

A search of computers taken from the Hoffner home has found 'no additional items that would be considered child pornography,' said Blue Earth County Sheriff's Captain Rich Murry.

Hoffner was charged last month with one count of using minors in a sexual performance or pornographic work and one count of possessing child pornography. Both are felonies. He has been the university's head football coach since 2008.

Prosecutor Michael Hanson - who was the one to cast the final decision that the images were pornographic and an arrest had to be made - said on Wednesday: 'Adults should not make videos of children in lewd poses -- period.'

Hoffner spoke to the court yesterday to explain the events surrounding the three videos. Two of them - which prosecutors said are the most troubling - show his children fooling around after a whirlpool bubble bath. They drop their towels and run around naked. At one point, the eight-year-old son grabs his genitals and his daughters bend over and spread their buttocks apart. These were shot in June.

Hoffner told the court, that after their bath, the children came down to where he was working and asked their father to videotape them because they had made upÂ  skit and wanted their dad to record it - which he did on the work Blackberry, according to the Star Tribune.

'It started with their towels on,' he said. 'They were singing, dancing and laughing. They were doing silly things, having fun.' He said his son seemed determined to 'sabotage' his sisters' routine and jumped in front of them and 'grabbed his private parts' for a few seconds.

Controversy: Hoffner was arrested and escorted off a football practice field in August, he remains on leave pending a university investigation

He said he stopped recording at this point but then his daughters, who were upset with their brother, asked them to record it again. This time, the son ran in naked with just a football helmet on. Hoffner said at this point he stopped recording as he knew his son was determined to 'mess everything up'.

In an August video, one of the coach's daughters is woken up by her father and told to go to the bathroom. As she is followed to the bathroom, the camera is focused on her underwear.

He said he did not show the videos to anyone and did not even view them again after taking them. In fact, he forgot they were even on there when he took his phone to the university's IT department, he told the court.

Support: Hoffman's wife Melodee has publicly rejected the charges as ridiculous saying that her husband is innocent and charges against him are 'ridiculous and baseless'

But Hanson said it is for this very reason that charges should be withheld. He said: 'You typically have videos made to show to your friends or put on Facebook. That didn't happen here and it didn't happen for a pretty good reason.'

Hoffner said he was genuinely shocked when he was arrested on the pornography charges and he had no idea what videos they were talking about.

A search of computers and other equipment taken from Hoffner's home when he was arrested turned up no evidence to support the prosecution's case. Social workers who interviewed the children and saw the videos said they found no evidence the couple's children had been abused.
