HMRC was accused yesterday of taking ‘a smash and grab’ approach with its demand for new powers to seize money directly from people’s bank accounts.

Britain’s leading tax experts warned the taxman risks being ‘unconstitutional’ with the controversial plans, which could come into force within months.

The proposed new powers - which were published in the Budget and subject to a public consultation which closed yesterday - have triggered an outcry among tax experts.

HM Revenue and Customs has been accused of taking a 'smash and grab' approach with its demand for new powers to seize money directly from people’s bank accounts

If HMRC believes anyone owes money to them, they will be able to take the cash directly from current accounts, joint accounts or tax-free Isas to settle an unpaid tax bill.

Around 17,000 people a year will have money seized under the proposed new powers, known as the ‘direct recovery of debts’. Each will typically owe £5,800.

To be targeted, somone must owe at least £1,000 to the tax man – and must have at least £5,000 left across their accounts after the money for their tax debt has been removed.

In its response, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales said it has ‘no sympathy’ for those who do not pay the tax they owe despite having the means to do so.

But it added: ‘Under UK law, if someone owes you money, you cannot just help yourself to it. Permission of the court is required.

‘For these reasons, the proposed new powers are unconstitutional and wrong in principle. Independent, judicial oversight is essential for any such recovery power.’

If it is granted the new powers, HMRC will not need to apply to a court in order to grab money directly from people’s accounts.

Chas Roy-Chowdhury, head of taxation at the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, said: ‘These new powers are knocking at the door of being unconstitutional.

‘It will mean HMRC can take a ‘smash and grab’ approach by delving into someone’ s back account at will and taking their money.’

The ICAEW’s response also raised concerns that HMRC will ‘inevitably make errors’ which could have ‘very damaging consequences’.

Official documents reveal it expects to get £375million between 2015 and 2019, but the ICAEW said this amount is small when it is compared to the potential loss of trust among the public.

It warned: ‘The publicity given to any case where DRD is used inappropriately would have a damaging effect on public confidence in the tax system.

‘In the UK, voluntary compliance and trust in the tax system in the tax system are crucial to the way the system operates. The cost of trust being eroded will far outweigh the sums DRD is expected to yield.’

Patrick Stevens, of the Chartered Institute of Taxation, said he is fearful of the vulnerable people who will be targeted by the new powers, such as the elderly and the sick.

While HMRC says it will have contacted a person at least nine times before removing their money, Mr Stevens said: ‘That is not going to be make a difference if you never got the letters [because you are abroad] or do not understand why you are receiving it.’

The Forum of Private Business, the business lobby group, also yesterday urged the government to scrap the plans.

Alexander Jackman, the forum’s head of policy, said it ‘unequivocally condemns tax avoidance and tax evasion’, but fears the proposed new powers will ‘unfairly target’ small firms.

During a recent grilling by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee, Lin Homer, chief executive of HMRC, said the people who will be targeted by the new money-grabbing powers can afford to pay their tax, but simply refuse to pay it.

She said they are ‘gaming the system’. Mrs Homer said: ‘They don’t dispute that the tax is due. They just won’t pay. They just fold their arms and wait for us to take some other action.’
