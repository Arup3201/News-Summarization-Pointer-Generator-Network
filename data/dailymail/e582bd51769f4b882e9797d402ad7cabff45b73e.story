A Manhattan socialite and former 1970s TV actress is refusing to leave a $25 million estate in Southampton, New York that belonged to her late shipping-magnate husband and which is due to be sold on Friday.

Tara Tyson Kulukundis has locked herself inside the stunning beachfront property and is refusing to leave - even though a new buyer is set to purchase the property this week.

Her husband was M. Michael Kulukundis, a Greek shipping fortune heir who died in 2010 at the age of 76. His will provided for his widow financially, but didn't leave his properties to her.

At the time of his death, the properties had a total value of $70 million and included another Southampton home, an apartment at Fifth Avenue's Pierre Hotel and a five-story townhouse on East 67th Street which has since been sold.

The executors of her hubby's estate filled a court order in Manhattan on Monday in a bid to force her out of the five-bedroom, five-bathroom mansion at 320 Murray Place.

They claim that for the past six weeks she has ‘locked herself in’ and blocked movers, cleaners and real estate agents from entering - thus jeopardizing the proposed sale.

The property is the latest to be sold to raise funds to pay off the estate's $30.5 million mortgage debt and to support Tara Tyson Kulukundis' ‘extravagant lifestyle,’ the filing states.

When Kulukundis died, his widow and their four children Eric, Manuel, Cassandra, and Christopher got shares in a trust worth an estimated $50 million in assets.

Using her stage name of Tara Tyson, she was a jobbing actress back in the 1970s featuring in episodes of hit TV shows Charlie’s Angels and Starsky and Hutch.

She also performed in the Off-Broadway plays ‘Foreplay’ and ‘Porno Stars at Home,’ according to IMDB.com, and was photographed by Andy Warhol.

On March 7, eldest son Eric Kulukundis, 44, moved his belongings out of the property and attempted to persuade his mom to do the same.

‘Mrs. Kulukundis appears to be very resistant to the idea of moving out, and Eric is reluctant to do things which upset her,’ his attorney wrote to the executors, according to the court papers.

He has also had his own troubles in Southampton. On March 1 he turned himself in to local police after crashing and abandoning a vehicle in Sagaponack days earlier, reports Southamptonpatch.

He has been charged with aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle in the second degree, a misdemeanor, and leaving the scene of an accident with property damage and being an unlicensed driver, both traffic infractions, as well as a number of vehicle and traffic infractions.

His right to drive had already been suspended due to unpaid fines.

The stunning property is spread over 4.3 acres with approx. 300 ft. directly facing the ocean. It also has an Olympic-size swimming pool and two waterfall spas.

The executors are concerned that should Friday's deal collapse, mortgage payments of $2,174 a day will quickly add to the debts, along with additional charges of $20,000 a month, reports DNAinfo.

The estate currently pays for a gardener, chauffeur, two housekeepers and other staff at the Southampton home and Pierre residence.

This isn’t the first time that the executors of her husband’s will and Mrs. Kulukundis have clashed.

It took a court order last October for real estate agents Sotheby's International Realty to gain entry to the property. Not long after she changed the locks.

In 2011, Kulukundis also refused to allow appraisers to assess artwork at the property for a federal estate tax return, according to the filing.

The executors also claim that in 
2012, they informed her of the need to sell the estate's sizeable art 
collection to raise funds.

Kulukundis has so far successfully stalled Sotheby's agents from appraising the art works, court papers say.

Back in the 70s and 80s Kulukundis 
was a regular fixture in Manhattan gossip columns and a 1979 issue of New York 
magazine features a story of an altercation with Elaine Kaufman, the 
late proprietor of legendary Upper East Side eatery Elaine's.

The pair reportedly got into a 
catfight in which Kulukundis claimed Kaufman scratched her face, while 
the restauranteur claimed the actress set her dress aflame with a lit 
cigarette.
