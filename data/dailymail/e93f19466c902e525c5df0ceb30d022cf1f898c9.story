Booming supermarket chain Lidl is set to move into some of London's wealthiest neighbourhoods as it launches a new range of 48 premium French wines to tempt rich customers.

The German discount chain currently only has a handful of shops in the capital, most of which in less privileged areas of the city, and none in the centre.

However, Lidl is now making a push for wealthier shoppers by selling wines from classic regions such as Bordeaux and Châteauneuf-du-Pape for as little as £5.

Booming: Supermarket chain Lidl is set to move into some of London's wealthiest neighbourhoods as it launches a new range of 48 premium French wines to tempt rich customers

The wines will go on sale in a French promotion - the chain's largest wine event - on September 5, with wines only available for a limited period.

Shoppers will be able to snap up a Côtes de Gascogne Sauvignon Blanc L'Escargot 2013 for just £4.99, or can pay £25.99 for a Haut-Médoc Sociando Mallet 2008 Bordeaux.

The following month a further eight wines will hit the shelves, all available for less than £7, including a £4.99 Languedoc-Roussillon, Pays d'Oc Cabernet Sauvignon Bouchard 2013, and a £6.99 Médoc Château Taffard 2011.

If the promotion, thought to be worth £12million, proves to be a success, a range of what the chain calls 'super premium' wines will go on sale in selected stores at a future date.

This selection includes a £49.99 2000 Premier Cru Hospices de Beaune from Burgundy, but also a Sauternes Cuvee d'Exception le Tertre du Lys D'Or 2006 Bordeaux for just £7.99.

Wine buyers at Lidl have purchased more than one million bottles from all of France's classic regions.

Hoping for success: The supermarket hopes the promotion will tempt shoppers away from more traditional rivals such as Tesco and Sainsbury's

The supermarket hopes the promotion will tempt shoppers away from more traditional rivals such as Tesco and Sainsbury’s.

A spokesman from the chain told MailOnline that the promotion will be Lidl's 'largest wine offer' ever.

'Lidl will be launching 48 wines in a French promotion which starts on September 4th, the wines will be on the shelf until stocks last,'  she said.

She added: 'The selection of wines come from across many of the classic French wine regions including Bordeaux, The Loire Valley and Châteauneuf-du-Pape.

'With wine ranging from £5 -£25 there is something for anyone with an interest in French wine.'

French wine makers said they have been surprised by the scale of Lidl’s ambition – particularly as it is a name they might have steered clear of a few years ago.

Paul Goldschmidt, owner of Chateau Siaurac in Lalande de Pomerol in the region of Bordeaux, is supplying a 2007 Reserve de la Baronne priced at £13.99.

He said: ‘Some retailers bargain on quality – but Lidl didn’t.’

Lidl, and similar chain Aldi, have boomed in recent years, finding success among middle-classes by undercutting British supermarkets on luxury goods.

And figures released earlier this month revealed that the combined sales of Lidl and Aldi are likely to top £10billion and overtake 
those of Morrisons. The two chains together now hold more than eight per cent of the country's grocery market.

Experts have put their rapid rise down to middle-class shoppers deserting 
the likes of Sainsbury’s, Tesco and even Waitrose, for the discount 
chains.

Lidl now has more than 600 UK shops in the UK, and expects to generate record sales of £7 billion this year after sales up to July grew by more than 22 per cent.

Recent openings have seen the chain target more affluent areas such as Maidenhead in Berkshire, and Dorking in Surrey, with central London expected to follow shortly. 

'There are challenges but if we really want to be established as a leading retailer in the UK then we have to have a presence in central London,' Lidl's senior buying manager Ben Hulme told the Evening Standard. 

Mr Hulme said he was confident that the forthcoming wine promotion would help bring new shoppers to the store.

He added: 'We want to be aiming at people who have not considered us before. The message is "come and a give it a try. Pick up a few bottles and see if you like them".'
