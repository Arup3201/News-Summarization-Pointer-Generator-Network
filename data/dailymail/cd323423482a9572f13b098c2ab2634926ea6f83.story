Tests for a woman from Sierra Leone showing symptoms of Ebola have come back negative after she was held at a Scottish immigration removal centre.

The woman was detained at Dungavel Detention Centre in South Lanarkshire after she fell ill and was taken to hospital where doctors carried out tests.

Health chiefs confirmed last night that she did not have the disease. A Scottish Government spokesman said: 'The results have now been returned and they have confirmed that she tested negative'.

She was placed in isolation in the
infectious diseases ward of a Lanarkshire hospital until the results became
known.

It is understood she was treated at Monklands Hospital in Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, while limited numbers of staff were allowed in contact with the patient.

The detention centre near the town of Strathaven is used as a holding unit for failed asylum seekers waiting deportation.

Officials from the Home Office suspended the detention or release of people from the unit during the investigation to islolate the risk in case it was positive.

Health officials across the UK were alerted to the situation and a full emergency plan was prepared.

The latest Ebola epidemic in Africa began in Guinea in February and has since spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.

It is transmitted through direct contact with the body fluids of an infected person.

Initial flu-like symptoms can be followed by external haemorrhaging from areas such as the eyes and gums, and internal bleeding leading to organ failure.

This latest incident in Scotland comes weeks after two athletes from Sierra Leone were tested for the deadly virus during the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. The results were negative and the pair went on to compete.

A group of international doctors yesterday admitted they did not know the true scale of the deaths from the deadly outbreak. 

Doctors Without Borders (Medecin Sans Frontieres) resembled the outbreak in west Africa to a state of war and said that the epidemic could last another six months. 

Their warning follows an announcement by a World Health Organisation official, who claimed that Ebola treatment centres are filling up faster than they can be provided in west Africa.

WHO spokesman in Geneva Gregory Hartl said: 'The flood of patients into every newly opened treatment center is evidence that the numbers aren't keeping up.'

The Organization also said today that the death toll  has risen to 1,145, the World Health Organization, as 76 new deaths were reported in the two days to August 13 in the four West African nations affected by the epidemic.

The U.N. health agency said that a total of 152 confirmed, probable and suspected new cases of the deadly hemorrhagic fever were reported in the two day period in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone, bringing the total for the outbreak to 2,127.

Joanne Liu, president of Medecins Sans Frontieres, said the pace of outbreaks in Guinea had slowed but other countries, particularly Liberia, now had to be the focus of efforts to contain the disease.

She said: ‘If we don’t stabilise Liberia, we will never stabilise the region. In terms of timeline, we’re not talking in terms of weeks, we’re talking in terms of months ... at least I would say six months, and I’m being ... very optimistic.’

Her warning came after the World Health Organization said the toll of 1,069 deaths and a further 900 sufferers could ‘vastly underestimate the magnitude’ of the outbreak.

The first European victim of Ebola, Spanish priest Miguel Pajares, died on Monday - five days after being airlifted from Liberia to Madrid for expert care. 

The 75-year-old's condition was described as stable on arrival in Spain and it is thought he was given ZMapp, an experimental drug credited with the ‘miraculous’ recovery of two American aid workers.

His body was cremated to prevent the virus spreading.

What is Ebola virus disease?

Ebola is a severe, often fatal illness, with a death rate of up to 90 per cent.The illness affects humans as well as primates, including monkeys, gorillas and chimpanzees.

How do people become infected with the virus?

Ebola is transmitted through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals.

In Africa infection in humans has happened as a result of contact with chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines found ill or dead in the rainforest.

Once a person becomes infected, the virus can spread through contact with a sufferer's blood, urine, saliva, stools and semen. A person can also become infected if broken skin comes into contact with a victim's soiled clothing, bed linen or used needles.

Men who have recovered from the disease, can still spread the virus to their partner through their semen for seven weeks after recovery.

Who is most at risk?

Those at risk during an outbreak include:

What are the typical signs and symptoms?

Sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. That is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function and internal and external bleeding.

The incubation period is between two and 21 days. A person will become contagious once they start to show symptoms.

When should you seek medical care?

If a person is in an area affected by the outbreak, or has been in contact with a person known or suspected to have Ebola, they should seek medical help immediately.

What is the treatment?

Severely ill patients require intensive supportive care. They need intravenous fluids to rehydrate them.

But there is currently no specific treatment for the disease. Some patients will recover with the appropriate care.Can Ebola be prevented?

Currently there is no licensed vaccine for Ebola. Several are being tested but are not available for clinical use.

Is it safe to travel to affected areas?

The World Health Organisation reviews the public health situation regularly, and recommends travel or trade restrictions if necessary. The risk of infection for travellers is very low since person-to-person transmission results from direct contact with bodily fluids of victims.
