Newly-elected: Libya's interim Prime Minister Abdel-Rahim al-Keeb speaks on the phone at the end of a public vote

The National Transitional Council of Libya has chosen an electronics engineer as its new interim president as the country seeks to re-wire itself for the post-Gaddafi era.

Abdel-Rahim al-Keeb, from Tripoli, was elected last night by 26 votes cast by 51 members of the NTC and he will appoint a new Cabinet in coming days.

Speaking about his election, Mr al-Keeb 
said: 'This transition period has its own challenges. One thing we will 
be doing is working very closely with the NTC and listening to the 
Libyan people.'

'We salute and remember the revolutionaries who we will never forget. We will not forget their families,' he said.

'I say to them that the NTC did not and will not forget them and also the coming government will do the same.'

Mr Al-Keeb did not set out any specific 
plans for Libya during the coming months, but said that worries over 
foreign oil contracts are unfounded.

'We understand that we had 42 years 
with a brutal dictator... concerns are in order. But there should be 
none of them,' he said. 'We demand respect for our national rights.'

The prime minister said he expected to choose his cabinet ministers within two weeks.

'We said we would (elect a cabinet) a month from the liberation. We have two weeks left and we intend to meet that deadline.'

The new government is to run Libya in the coming months and to pave the way for general elections.

Al-Keeb is considered to be a good choice for the transitional government as he is a consensus candidate.

Although his religion is listed as Sunni Islam, academia has dominated his life and he is not thought of as a radical.

He also has no links with the Gaddafi regime and has spoken out against the dictator in the past.

As he is from Tripoli in the west of the country, his appointment balances the influence at the top of government as the president is from the east of Libya.

He graduated from the University of Tripoli before going to the U.S. in 1975 to continue studying.

He became a professor at the University of Alabama in 1985 and has worked at the University in Sharjah, Dubai, and the Petroleum Institute in Abu Dhabi.

The
NTC wants to form a new interim government after the fall of Moammar 
Gaddafi because its initial members started out as an impromptu group.

Jalal el-Gallal, an NTC spokesman, says Mr al-Keeb received 26 votes in the election.

One
of his first duties will be to try and ensure peaceful stability in the
country with the U.N. Security Council urging Libyan authorities to 
prevent thousands of Gaddafi's heavy weapons falling into the hands of 
terrorists following the country's eight-month conflict.

The Russian-drafted resolution 
adopted unanimously by the council also called on the Libyan government 
to destroy chemical weapons stockpiles in coordination with 
international authorities.

Ian
Martin, the top UN envoy to Libya, told the council last Wednesday 
that Libya under Gaddafi had accumulated the largest known stockpile of 
shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles in any non-producing country.

While
thousands were destroyed during NATO operations, he said the UN is 
increasingly concerned 'over the looting and likely proliferation' of 
these weapons and other munitions, as well as a spate of newly-laid 
mines within the country.

U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Andrew Shapiro said earlier this month that Libya was believed to have about 20,000 shoulder-fired missiles in its arsenals before civil war began in March.

He said terrorist groups have expressed interest in obtaining some of the missiles, which 'could pose a threat to civil aviation'.

The resolution adopted on Monday 
calls on Libyan authorities 'to take all necessary steps to prevent the 
proliferation of all arms and related material of all types, in 
particular man-portable surface-to-air missiles, to ensure their proper 
custody.'

It calls on countries in the region 'to consider appropriate measures to prevent the proliferation' of these weapons.

The Security Council imposed an arms embargo against the Gaddafi government soon after the uprising began and it remains in place.

It reminded all countries yesterdayÂ  that they are barred from purchasing or procuring weapons from Libya and from using their aircraft or ships to transport Libyan weapons.

Russia's deputy UN ambassador Alexander Pankin said the main aim of the resolution is to prevent 'a breach of the arms embargo'.

The risk of shoulder-fired missiles and other weapons 'falling into the hands of terrorist groups... is very high,' he said, and there is also a risk to civil aviation flights.

'The Libyan authorities bear the brunt of the burden for this, but the problems require constructive cooperation with Libya's neighboring states and the whole of the international community,' said Mr Pankin.

The Security Council resolution expressed concern at the proliferation of weapons in the region 'and its potential impact on regional and international peace and security'.

The U.S. has contributed about $40million toward finding and destroying the surface-to-air missiles and sent weapons experts to the country. It co-sponsored the resolution along with France, Britain, Nigeria and Portugal.
