They had been back on Earth for a matter of hours.

But that was no excuse for three International Space Station astronauts were who whipped into some colourful traditional Kazakh costumes for a press conference today after their Soyuz spacecraft landed in the country.

Anton Shkaplerov, Anatoly Ivanishin and American Daniel Burbank had been in space for 163 days before jettisoning their capsule from the space station this morning.

They were dragged form their capsule and were soon

This afternoon, Nasa tweeted: 'Soyuz capsule lands safely at 7:45 am EDT on the steppe of Kazakhstan. All 3 crew members are safe and adjusting to gravity.'

Nasa television broadcast vivid 
images of the capsule carried by a parachute swaying slightly as it 
floated downward in the clear skies while six all-terrain vehicles 
approached the landing spot.

Eight search-and-rescue helicopters circled the landing site to ensure a speedy recovery.

Shkaplerov, in the capsule's central seat, was the first to be hauled out and hoisted into a reclining chair.

While
 medical personnel mopped his brow and checked his vital signs, the 
astronaut smiled broadly and chatted with his colleagues.

Ivanishin, and then a heartily laughing Burbank, went through the same procedure a few minutes later.

Speaking from the touchdown site, Nasa spokesman Rob Navias called it 'a bullseye landing'.

'The spacecraft landed almost exactly where it was forecast to,' he told Nasa television.

Earlier NASA TV showed footage today of the 
departing crew saying their farewells to the three astronauts left 
behind before being shut into their cramped capsule.

'Although I will miss this place and 
this crew, I also am very happy to return home to my family,' Burbank 
said. 'It is time for Expedition 30 to step aside and make way for 
Expedition 31.'

The capsule undocked and began a slow, gentle drift away from the space station as scheduled at 0818 GMT.

Its landing was aided by the deployment of several parachutes, which slowed its descent. Three small engines also fired to soften the landing.

The Soyuz TMA spacecraft is composed of three elements attached end-to-end - the Orbital Module, the Descent Module and the Instrumentation/Propulsion Module.

The crew occupies the central element, the Descent Module. The other two modules are jettisoned prior to re-entry. They burn up in the atmosphere, so only the Descent Module returns to Earth.

The Orbital Module provided the crew with extra living space during the two-day trip to the Station.

It contains systems vital to rendezvous and docking with the Station's Pirs Docking Compartment or other port - a docking mechanism, a hatch and rendezvous antennas.

Having shed two-thirds of its mass, the Soyuz reached 'Entry Interface' - a point 400,000 feet above the Earth, where friction due to the thickening atmosphere heated its outer surfaces - three hours after undocking.

With only 23 minutes left before it landed on the grassy plains of central Asia, attention in the module would have turned to slowing its rate of descent.

Eight minutes later, the spacecraft streaked through the sky at a rate of 755 feet per second (514mph). Before it touched down, its speed slowed to only five feet per second (3mph), and it landed at an even lower speed than that.

As the Soyuz made its gradual descent, one unidentified ground control staff member remarked that 'Anatoly (Ivanishin) must be real hungry right now' and that he would be looking forward to 'soup and some meat'.

The retirement of the U.S. shuttle fleet has left Russia's Soyuz spacecraft as the only means to deliver crews to the space outpost.

Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko has now taken over as commander of the space station and will stay until July together with NASA astronaut Don Pettit and Holland's Andre Kuipers.

They will now prepare for the arrival of first commercial cargo shipment to the space station in early May. The Space Exploration Technologies Corp., better known as SpaceX, launches its Dragon capsule from Cape Canaveral on April 30, and the capsule will take a few days to get to the space station.

It will be the first time a private company has launched space station supplies.

The space station will then return to its standard six-person crew with the arrival of NASA astronaut Joe Acaba and Russian colleagues Gennady Padalka and Sergei Revin, who will blast off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on May 17.
