Geary allegedly told investigators that while he was watching the child, he grew tired of her crying and shook her to make her stop before throwing her onto a bed, according to the Davis Clipper.

Geary was reportedly watching the baby while his 20-year-0ld girlfriend, Jennifer Wild, was working.

After allegedly injuring the child, Geary picked up Wild from work and took the child to Davis Hospital, investigators say.

'Aliyah saved my life,' she said in the prepared statement. 'Please parents, set your children down when frustrated. No child should ever have to go through the traumatic abuse that Aliyah has suffered.'

The Deseret News reported that the Davis County Attorney's Office is expected to review the case for possible criminal charges once an autopsy on the child has been completed.

Wild is not a suspect.
