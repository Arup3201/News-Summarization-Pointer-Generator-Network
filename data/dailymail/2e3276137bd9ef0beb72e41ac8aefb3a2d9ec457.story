An MP has complained after seeing a sign posted near a popular park warning dog-walkers to stay out of 'Islamic areas'.

Labour Member of Parliament Jim Fitzpatrick alerted police and the local mayor about the sign after it was flagged up by one of the residents in his east London constituency.

The sign, which was spotted on the railings of Bartlett Park, reads: 'Do not walk your dog here! Muslims do not like dogs. This is an Islamic area now.'

Police say an investigation is now underway to find out who put it up.

In his letter to recently re-elected Tower Hamlets Mayor Lutfur Rahman, the MP for Poplar and Limehouse said: 'I have no idea whether this was posted by the EDL, Islamists or another organisation. Regardless, this is a highly divisive sign.

'I am writing to request an investigation.

'I would also like to know what the council is currently doing to prevent signs like this from appearing.'

A spokesman for the MP added: 'We want people who put those signs up to be caught.

'It could be anybody - antagonists from either side.'

Tower Hamlets police said: 'The material has been taken down and a crime report completed for further investigation.'

A Tower Hamlets Council spokesman said: 'We have been alerted to a fly-poster stuck on a sign post near Bartlett Park, E14. We have removed it and are liaising with the police to investigate this alarmingÂ  and divisive poster.

'The council actively promotes the No Place for Hate campaign whereby people of different faiths, cultures, lifestyles and backgrounds live in harmony. This means we support community cohesion and would not want the actions of any individual or small group to impact on this.'
