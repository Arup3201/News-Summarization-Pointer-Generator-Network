A father has been left appalled by waiting staff at a sports bar called Friendly's after he was handed a receipt that described his three-year-old son as a 'f****** needy kid'.

For a father's day treat, Joseph Gibson stopped for a meal at the St Louis sports bar on Sunday, after the manager lifted his usual bar on people under the age of 21.

But his request for an extra chicken leg for his son resulted in an unfriendly remark about the family being printed on the receipt.

Offensive: Joseph Gibson with his three-year-old son, who a waitress referred to as 'f****** needy' on their bill

Mr Gibson, who had been spending the day with his son at the nearby Missouri botanical gardens, says his son was well-behaved in the bar.

He was so shocked by the comment that he contacted the St Louis Post Dispatch, not because he wanted 'anything out of it. But I was pretty upset that it happened'.

Friendly's manager Denny Domachowski said the waitress meant the comment as a joke to kitchen staff and intended to delete it before handing the $13.75 bill to Mr Gibson.

'The incident shouldn't have happened, and I made sure [the waitress] understands that,' Mr Domachowski told CNN.

'She didn't mean to offend the gentleman and his son. She had a good experience with them as customers. She was just in a hurry and forgot to take that off.'

Apology: The manager of Friendly's in St Louis apologized for the inappropriate comment on a bill

He added that he apologized several times to the customer and reprimanded his employee.

Mr Domachowski added that the sports bar had made a couple of concessions to Mr Gibson on Father's Day, by allowing a child in and by agreeing to the order of a single chicken leg.

'Normally, we don't allow substitutions. I figured because it was Father's Day, we'd give him the single leg and I'd have the rest for my lunch,' he said.

Mr Gibson said he understands 'accidents can happen, but you can also do things to prevent them'.

'If it happened to me, it could happen again,' he said. 'What else are they writing about other people?'
