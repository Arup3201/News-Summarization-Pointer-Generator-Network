A Royal Navy rapid reaction force is to set sail for Gibraltar on  Monday as tensions over the Rock continue to rise.

Ten vessels including the aircraft  carrier Illustrious, two frigates and support ships are heading to the waters off Gibraltar as part of an annual exercise.

But defence officials have revealed that three of them – the frigate Westminster and two support vessels – will call in at the British sovereign base at Gibraltar for three days, beginning on August 19.

Setting sail: HMS Westminster will leave Britain on Monday and is expected in Gibraltar within days

Incoming: HMS Westminster (left) will set sail for Gibraltar on Monday. Gibraltar's chief minister Fabian Picardo (right) urged the government to 'demonstrate the waters are British by filling them with British assets'

In a show of force, the warships will practise ‘a range of operations’ including ‘deterring adversaries’.

Although diplomatic relations between
Britain and Spain over Gibraltar have plunged into the deep freeze, the
Ministry of Defence insisted that the mission, called Cougar ’13, is a 
long-planned exercise.

But senior government sources 
conceded that the timing is convenient since it will reassure the people
of Gibraltar after Spain imposed draconian border checks in a  dispute 
over fishing.

And while the deployment could have been delayed to avoid upsetting the Spanish government, it was not.

A Whitehall source said: ‘The timing
is not unhelpful. We could  have decided to call it off or divert it  
away from Gibraltar to avoid offending  the Spanish. But there was 
absolutely no question of that.’

The deployment follows demands from 
the government of Gibraltar for the coalition to beef up its naval 
presence off the Rock, and calls for gunboat diplomacy from Tory MPs.

David Cameron broke the news that the
task force was set to sail to his Spanish counterpart Mariano Rajoy in a
tense phone call on Wednesday which failed to resolve the diplomatic 
standoff.

Appeal: David Cameron asked the Spanish Prime Minister to scale back contentious border checks with the British territory, including blocking flights to Gibraltar

Access: The Spanish government raised the prospect of imposing a 50 euros (£43) charge on vehicles entering Gibraltar and closing Spanish airspace to flights heading for the Rock

News that British warships are heading to Gibraltar is likely to add to the tensions with Spain

Downing Street claimed Mr Rajoy had 
offered to ‘de-escalate’ the  crisis after Mr Cameron issued a coded 
warning that Britain might take Spain to the European Court of Justice 
over the ‘disproportionate’ border checks.

But within minutes of the call, the Spanish government insisted they were doing nothing wrong.

Spanish foreign minister Jose 
Garcia-Margallo has threatened to impose tolls at the border and ban 
Gibraltar-bound aircraft from Spanish airspace because the government of
Gibraltar sank concrete blocks off the Rock to deter Spanish fishermen.

Last night Tory MP Andrew Rosindell, a
member of the all-party Parliamentary group on Gibraltar, said: ‘It’s 
wonderful news that the Royal Navy is on its way but I’d prefer it if 
this deployment was in response to the behaviour of the Spanish.

‘If they’re going down there, they might as well stay while this situation is going on.

‘The most powerful thing we could do 
is to announce that the Queen is going to visit. That would send the 
strongest signal that Gibraltar is British.’

On the ground, Spanish officials 
again forced motorists to wait for hours yesterday, imposing more border
checks when they spotted UKIP deputy leader Paul Nuttall viewing their 
operations.

A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: ‘The Royal Navy’s annual Cougar deployment is long-planned and well-established.

‘Gibraltar is a strategic base for UK
defence and as such Royal Navy ships visit its waters throughout the 
year as part of a range of regular and routine deployments.’

Tensions: The British Foreign Office fears the proposed Spanish border charges would penalise islanders who regularly commute to Spain for work

Clash: Prime Minister David Cameron made clear 
his unhappiness to his Spanish counterpart Mariano Rajoy, warning 
controls at the border with Gibraltar were 'disproportionate and 
unacceptable'

Warship: The Ministry of Defence stressed that the movement of the nine-vessel Response Force Task Group was 'long-planned'

Scale back: Mr Rajoy has offered to 'reduce measures' at the Gibraltar border after his conversation with David Cameron. Passengers prepare to board a flight at Gibraltar airport, which could be banned from entering Spanish airspace under the proposals
