The historic draft of Michael Sam by the NFL’s St Louis Rams also introduced the world to his boyfriend Vito Cammisano.

The two men embraced in tears of joy before repeatedly kissing after Sam smashed cake into Cammisano’s face on national television – and answered rampant speculation over whether the defensive lineman has a boyfriend.

The 2013 University of Missouri graduate has been publicly out since 2011 and competed on the school’s swim team as its first gay athlete, according to OutSports.

He attended Rockhurst High School, on Kansas City, Missouri, prior to attending Mizzou as a communications major, according to his Facebook profile.

Sam’s 23-year-old boyfriend was previously unknown to all but their closest friends prior to Saturday night’s big moment - except to anyone who may have stumbled across his social media accounts.

The Cumulus Broadcasting intern’s Instagram feed is filled with pictures of him and Sam on trips, having drinks together and even just relaxing at home.

Sam publicly acknowledged Cammisano via social media for the first time by tagging him in a tweet with a picture of the two kissing while covered in cake.

His Facebook page lists only one athlete he likes – Michael Sam.

Cammisano has two sisters and also worked in Missou’s Office of Disability Services while attending school.

He graduated last year from the same campus attended by his star football player boyfriend.

Earlier reports from multiple media outlets pegged a Sean Smith from Urbana, Illinois as Sam’s boyfriend.

There is some evidence to suggest a Sean Smith may have dated Sam in the past, but he clearly is not with him now.

Both Sam and Cammisano embraced in a historic moment inside Sam’s agent’s house in San Diego, California after he received the call he had been waiting for most of his life.

He was a St Louis Ram, he was in the NFL.

And Vito was there to celebrate with him.
