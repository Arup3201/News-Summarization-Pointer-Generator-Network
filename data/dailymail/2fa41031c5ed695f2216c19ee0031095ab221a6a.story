A glamour model has spent £22,000 on cosmetic procedures in a quest to look 'plastic fantastic' and attract male attention.

Raegan Sidley, 25, has splashed out almost the UK average wage on improving her looks, including regular Botox injections and a breast augmentation to take her from a 34C to a 32G.

'Looking this good 
definitely doesn’t come for free,' says Raegan. 'I’ve spent £22K on making over my 
appearance to make men lust after me.'

Raegan says she is 'terminally single' despite all her efforts to attract a 'nice lad', which now include laser vaginal rejuvenation

'I’m 100 per cent committed to being as perfect as I can be, and I’ll try anything.

The glamour model has also spent
 £10K on her nails, fake tan and hair extensions in just three years.

She has spent a further £7,000 on facial fillers, Botox injections and semi-permanent makeup.

'I don’t want to be a normal, boring-looking girl,' explains Raegan. 'I take pride in how I look, and think all girls should too - especially when it comes to looking good naked.'

In fact, so keen is Raegan to look good naked that she's 
now signed up for the Protege Intima ‘Love Laser’, which promises to 
rejuvenate her intimate regions.

The procedure, which is pain-free, is the first non-surgical labia remodelling treatment in the UK and costs £1,000. Traditional labiaplasty can cost up to £4,000.

Raegan
 said: 'I wasn’t unhappy with how my vagina looked, but I think there’s 
always room for improvement. It’s important to look good "down there"'.

'Women are so critical of their bits, but why be miserable when you can do something about it?'

Raegan has now had her first laser treatment in a series of four.

'I have had my first treatment, and have three more to go before Christmas. I was nervous before my treatment but the procedure was very comfortable.'

'The head of the device they use to treat you looks like a giant pen, but once you get over that it just generally feels nice. It’s run across your labia and gently heats the tissue - that’s what makes the skin tighten.

'It’s a bit embarrassing I guess, but it’s totally non-invasive and painless.'

'I’ve not seen any changes as yet, 
but I was advised it takes four sessions to see results. I should have 
the full result in January or February, I think. I’ve been telling all 
of my friends about it, and some are really keen to try it for 
themselves.'

'I’m
 a firm believer in doing whatever it takes to make you look and feel 
confident.'

Editor of the The Cosmetic Surgery 
Guide magazine, Laura Casewell, said: 'This will be the next big thing as
 far as female cosmetic surgery goes.'

'The
 advances in most non-invasive cosmetic treatments have been astonishing
 in the last few years, and the days of surgical labiaplasty may be 
numbered now Protege Intima is offering such outstanding results without
 the need for knives or needles.'

However, despite all these efforts, Raegan claims she is ‘terminally single'.

While she has her heart set on David Beckham, Raegan says instead she only attracts ‘creeps’ and ‘pervs’.

She
 said: 'I’ve always enjoyed getting male attention and I love to flirt. 
Making myself "plastic fantastic" seemed like an easy way to make guys 
fancy me, but men just assume I’m "up for it".'

'I get offered sex all the time, but I can’t remember the last time a bloke asked me out for dinner.'

Raegan is still holding out for a Prince Charming who can see beyond her ‘sexy looks’.

'Just
 because I look fake and a bit "out there", it doesn’t mean I don’t want
 a fairytale romance,' she said. 'I’d much rather a nice lad who wanted
 a relationship.'

'I know Mr Right is out there. Eventually someone will sweep me off my size 4s and see past it all.'

Raegan is often the target of cruel comments from 'regular' girls who are jealous of her surgically-enhanced looks

And it's not just men who are unable 
to see past her fake breasts, fake nails, hair extensions, facial fillers and Botox. Raegan 
is often the target of cruel comments from ‘regular’ girls who are 
jealous of her surgically-enhanced looks.

'I’ve
 had girls walk up to me in nightclubs and verbally attack me for 
absolutely no reason other than my enhanced boobs or hair extensions,” 
Raegan said.

'I choose to look fake, but it’s not my problem if some girls are jealous of that.'

'Luckily most of my close friends work in the modelling industry and understand what it's like to get unwanted attention for being pretty, but other girls can be really mean and judgemental.'
