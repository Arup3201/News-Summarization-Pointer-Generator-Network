England midfielder Adam Lallana will celebrate his call-up into Roy Hodgson’s World Cup squad by sealing a £20million move to Liverpool this week.

It is a massive boost for Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, whose side have an outside chance of winning their first title since 1990 when the Premier League season reaches its climax on Sunday.

Lallana celebrated his 26th birthday on Saturday by choosing to join the Rodgers revolution at Anfield despite interest from other clubs.

On the move: Adam Lallana is hoping to seal a £20m move to Liverpool as early as next week

Southampton believe the fee represents fair value for a player who progressed through their respected youth academy, and all sides see sense in wrapping up the move before the England players report for manager Hodgson’s pre-World Cup training camp in Portugal on May 19.

Hodgson names his 23-man squad plus seven standby players for Brazil on Monday and Lallana is certain to be included.

Liverpool will hope Lallana’s imminent arrival is a lucky omen as they face Newcastle at Anfield on Sunday afternoon - two points behind leaders Manchester City, who face West Ham at The Etihad.

Due to City’s superior goal difference, Manuel Pellegrini’s side need only a draw to be champions for the second time in three seasons. Liverpool would finish top if they won and City lost.

Regardless of the outcome of the title race, the signing of Lallana marks the start of a bold summer of spending by Rodgers to ensure his team are strong enough to compete in both the Premier League and Champions League next season.

Owner John W Henry has promised Rodgers, who will be delighted to land Lallana so early, £60m plus any money he makes on sales.

Spend: Rodgers claims Liverpool have got to do everything they can to stay in the top four for the foreseeable future

Rodgers said about his planned revamp: ‘Teams have spent the money trying to get into the top four and can’t get in. For us now, we’re in it. Now we’ve got to do everything we can to stay in.’

Lallana’s departure from Southampton is likely to be followed by manager Mauricio Pochettino, who is wanted by Spurs.

Teenage defender Luke Shaw, who also has an outside chance of being in England’s World Cup party, is being hotly pursued by Manchester United and Chelsea and will seek talks about his future after his club’s final game of the season today, against Manchester United.
