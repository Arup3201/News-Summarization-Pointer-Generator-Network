A British tourist was yesterday found dead in a hotel room in Thailand after allegedly going on a drinking binge after he broke-up with his girlfriend.

The man, named locally as Carsten Denbigh, was found kneeling on the floor with his body resting on a bed in a room yesterday afternoon in Wang Krachae, Muang district, according to reports.

The 47-year-old's body was found on the floor but showed no injuries - and he had been dead for up to seven hours when found, police and doctors told theÂ Bangkok Post.

Mr Denbigh and his British girlfriend visited the island of Koh Mak in Trat province one week ago - but his girlfriend stayed with him for two nights before returning to the UK after an argument, police said.

The tourist had consumed large amounts of alcohol for several days after the split - and was sent for treatment at Trat Hospital for two days before being released on Monday, hotel staff said.

Officers at Muang Trat police station took him to a city hotel because he had no money for transport, reported the Bangkok Post.

A Foreign and Commonweath Office spokesman told MailOnline today: 'We are aware of the death of a British national in Thailand and we are providing consular assistance to the family.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
