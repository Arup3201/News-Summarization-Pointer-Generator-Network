Chelsea Manning, the former US intelligence analyst jailed for leaking hundreds of thousands of sensitive government documents to Wikileaks, has written what she is thankful for this Thanksgiving holiday.

Writing in The Times, the woman previously known as Bradley Manning, said she was grateful to ‘social and human justice pioneers who lead through action’ such as Martin Luther King Jr.

Manning is serving a 35-year sentence in prison at Fort Leavenworth and since sentencing in August, she has been ‘trying to decompress and focus on other things after a lengthy and exhausting court-martial process’.

Act for change: Chelsea Manning, who was previously known as Bradley, has written that she is thankful for 'social and human justice pioneers who lead through action' such as Martin Luther King Jr.

At the time she also revealed that she wanted to undergo hormone therapy to transition to a woman.

In the Times piece - part of a Thanksgiving series published yesterday - Manning wrote: ‘I’m thankful for people who, even surrounded by millions of Americans eating turkey during regularly scheduled commercial breaks in the Green Bay and Detroit football game… dare to ask probing, even dangerous, questions.’

After saying she was reticent to 
celebrate the holiday, she listed figures that fought and achieved 
social justice and equality. Among them was gay rights activist Harvey 
Milk, the first openly gay politician in America who fought for gay 
rights ordinances but was shot dead by a former colleague in 1978.

One day we can live together: Manning spoke of Martin Luther King Jr. (centre), the African-American civil rights activist, praising his decision to fight for striking sanitation workers instead of lobbying in Washington D.C.

Manning also mentioned Martin Luther King Jr., the African-American civil rights activist, for his decision to fight for striking sanitation workers in Memphis instead of lobbying in Washington D.C.

She wrote: ‘I’m thankful that one day… we can live together on this tiny “pale blue dot” of a planet and stop looking inward, at each other, but rather outward, into the space beyond this planet and the future of all of humanity.’

Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison for releasing 700,000 sensitive government documents to Wikileaks and is expected to be behind bars for at least eight years.

The former intelligence analyst was found guilty of 20 crimes, including six violations of the Espionage Act, as part of the Obama administration's unprecedented crackdown on media leaks.

But the judge acquitted her of the most serious charge, aiding the enemy, an offense that could have meant life in prison without parole.
