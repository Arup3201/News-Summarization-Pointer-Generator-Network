A Chinese toddler managed to get himself wedged stuck in a washing machine after climbing in when his mother wasn't looking. 

After spending 30 minutes trying to remove the Peng, 3, from the machine in the city of Suzhou in central China's Anhui province, his mum Qian Tien, 27, finally gave up and called the professionals.

But even experienced Chinese firemen who say children getting stuck in unusual places is not uncommon were unable to remove the boy.

In the end they resorted to tearing the machine apart using electronic hydraulic rescue tools, and later an angle grinder to saw it in half.

Fire brigade spokesman Yong Wu said: 'The youngster was not scared at all which was fortunate and in fact he was really excited to see so many firemen come into the house. 

'I think his mother was more worried when she saw the angle grinder starting to cut into the washing machine but it was quite safe, we managed to remove the drum and from then on it was easier to cut him free.'
