The great-grandmother, pictured last year, made a 'significant contribution to children's literature'

Nina Bawden, who wrote 48 books including the popular children’s story Carrie’s War, has died aged 87.

The award-winning novel set during the Second World War was based on her own childhood evacuation to South Wales.

It has been studied by schoolchildren as part of the national curriculum and been adapted for stage and screen.

Miss Bawden died yesterday at her home in North London, surrounded by her family, including son Robert.

She was regarded as one of the few writers of recent times to create successfully for both adults and children, and was admired for her depictions of childhood.

She once said she liked writing for children because ‘most people underestimate their understanding and the strength of their feelings and in my books for them I try to put this right.’

In 2002 her husband Austen Kark, the managing director of BBC World Service, was killed and she was badly hurt in the Potter’s Bar train crash.

She campaigned to get answers and later received almost £1million in compensation. In one of her last books, Dear Austen, she told the story of the crash in the form of letters to her late husband.

Her publisher Lennie Goodings called her ‘a gently fierce, clever, elegant, wickedly funny woman’.

Miss Goodings added: ‘She wrote slim books but they were powerful and extraordinarily acute observations about what makes us human. She was a wonderful storyteller and she was writing to the end.’

Miss Bawden often used personal experience in her work. Her first children’s book, The Secret Passage, published in 1963, was written for her three children after they found one in their cellar.

The Outside Child told the story of a girl who finds she has a half-brother and sister from her father’s first marriage. The author had a half-sister who had been sent away to live with cousins.

Miss Bawden won a scholarship to Oxford and studied alongside Margaret Roberts, who later became Margaret Thatcher.

She was made CBE in 1995 and in 2004 received the prestigious ST Dupont Golden Pen Award for literature.

The author of more than 40 books was hailed as an influence on young writers. She is pictured left, in 1997, and right, with her husband Austen Kark, who died in 2002

Playwright Sir David Hare, whose play 
The Permanent Way, about the privatisation of the railways, featured Mrs
 Bawden, paid tribute to the writer.

He said: ‘I am extremely sad to hear of Nina’s death.

‘Nina
 was an uncomplicatedly good woman, whose long fight to obtain justice 
for the victims of the Potters Bar crash was a model of eloquence, 
principle and human decency.’

Francesca Dow, managing director of Penguin children’s division, said: ‘We are hugely saddened by the death of Nina Bawden - as proud publishers of Nina’s work for Puffin, and for each of us here on a personal level.

‘Nina was a wonderful storyteller, brilliant at stepping into the minds of her characters and conjuring up a powerful sense of time and place.

‘Such is the appeal and power of her 
classic novels - including Carrie’s War and The Peppermint Pig - that 
they continue to sell strongly today.

‘Nina
 has made a significant contribution to children’s literature and been 
an influence on many younger writers. She will be sorely missed.’

She is survived by a son, a brother, two step-daughters, nine grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.

Two more from the writer's published list include the adult novel Circles Of Deceit, published in 1998, and children's tale The Peppermint Pig, published in 1977

Nina Bawden wanted to be a war reporter before she turned to and enjoyed a phenomenally successful career as a novelist.

She was the author of more than 40 books, for both adults and children, and was still writing just days before she died, at the age of 87.

Born Nina Mabey in Ilford in 1925, her mother was a teacher and her father a marine engineer.

A war-time evacuee, she was 14 when she was sent away with the rest of her grammar school at the beginning of the Second World War.

Bawden stayed with several different families before returning to London in 1942 and her most famous book, Carrie’s War, drew on her experiences in Wales.

Despite being eight when she wrote her first novel, Bawden harboured ambitions to ‘expose things’ as a journalist.

But in Oxford, where she read politics, philosophy and economics, she published her first short story, in a magazine.

She married Harry Bawden, an ex-airman, soon after graduating but at 22, she was expecting her first baby and so turned down job offers in journalism.

‘I actually hadn’t been using contraception but I thought if you didn’t want a baby then you couldn’t have one - this is a joke nowadays but that was how I felt,’ she said.

‘So I gave up my job because my mother said I couldn’t have a job and a baby, and I decided I had better concentrate on my writing.’

Bawden had two sons with her first husband and a daughter with Austen Kark, who she met on a London bus.

Her son Nicholas Bawden, who had experienced mental health problems, died aged 33, in 1981.

His family learned that his body had been pulled out of the Thames months after he had gone missing.

Her daughter Perdita Kark also died in March this year, while her other son Robert Bawden is a doctor.

One of the characters in Bawden’s Booker prize-shortlisted novel Circles Of Deceit, published in 1987, was based on Nicholas.

Bawden could not remember the Potters Bar rail crash, in which her husband was one of seven people killed.

‘I remember getting on the train and sitting down,’ she said.

It was only when she woke up in hospital covered in plaster that she discovered her husband had not survived.

Bawden, whose ankle was smashed and her arm, leg, shoulder, collarbone and several ribs broken, was in hospital for months after the tragedy.

The author, who campaigned to get answers after the accident, featured in a David Hare play on the crash.

In 2010, Bawden’s 1970 novel The Birds On The Trees was shortlisted for the Lost Man Booker Award, a special edition of the prize awarded by public vote.
