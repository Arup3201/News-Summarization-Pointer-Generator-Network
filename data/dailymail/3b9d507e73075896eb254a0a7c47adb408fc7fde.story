German police rescued a man who spent three days trapped in handcuffs - in an apparent 'autoerotic accident'. 

A neighbour contacted authorities in the southern city of Munich after becoming concerned about the whereabouts of the 57-year-old man.

When officers arrived at the home in the upmarket Schwabing district and rang the bell, there was no answer and three days' newspapers were lying on the doormat.

Through the mail slot, they saw a light was on in the flat and could hear 'a faint, woozy murmur'.

They broke open the door to find the man lying semi-conscious on the floor of his kitchen wearing underwear and women's boots, and restrained in handcuffs.

The officers were able to unlock the cuffs using a key found in the apartment and said there was no evidence of foul play.

'We assume it was an autoerotic accident that kept the Munich resident tied up in his apartment for more than three days,' the police said in a statement.

A spokesman contacted by AFP said the man, who was weak and dehydrated when he was found, was still being treated in hospital on Thursday.

'He is not in a critical condition,' the spokesman said, adding that the man was suffering from 'sore spots' from lying in one position for an extended period of time.
