A Duke college freshman and middle class Republican has hit out at critics after her secret career in porn was revealed.

According to a story in the college paper the Duke Chronicle, the trouble started for 'Lauren' (not her real name) when fellow college freshman Thomas Bagley came up to her and asked her if she was the same girl as the adult film star he'd been watching.

Lauren admitted that she acted in pornographic films under a stage name, but swore him to secrecy.

For his part, Bagley denies having recognized her in porn, telling the Daily Caller that she actually confessed her secret to him.

Both agree that despite his promise, Bagley blabbed at his next fraternity rush event.

Once he leaked the secret, people across campus were texting and tweeting about the Duke freshman porn star within a matter of days. 

The aspiring lawyer was crudely mocked and attacked online.

'If you b***ed her, report in,' wrote one anonymous poster on the CollegiateACB message board.

'We going to pretend like she 
was unaware of the social consequences of going into that business? she 
made a decision, now she needs to live with the consequences,' wrote another.

She soon found herself talking to the campus newspaper about her life in porn, which Lauren would later call an attempt to control the conversation.

In that interview, Lauren said she started in adult films as a way to offset her massive tuition bills, and called the Duke campus a place where women had to hide their sexuality, and were held to a 'virgin-wh*** dichotomy.'

In that story, the author took note of Lauren's 'designer bag' and new iPad as proof of her porn-riches.

However, Lauren wasn't entirely pleased with the Chronicle's representation.

While she thanked them for giving her a forum she also accused them of skewing her words and betraying her trust in a response on the blog Develle Dish, adding that they had 'portrayed me as a naÃ¯ve, attention seeking little girl who flaunts her wealth.'

She went even further detailing her life in pornography and the lack of impact she expects it to have on her future in a first-hand account published on xoJane Friday.

'I couldn't afford $60,000 in tuition, my family has undergone 
significant financial burden, and I saw a way to graduate from my dream 
school free of debt, doing something I absolutely love,' Lauren wrote. 'Because to be 
clear: My experience in porn has been nothing but supportive, exciting, 
thrilling and empowering.'

She further elaborated that the site she performed for was a 'rough sex website' but that she had never been 'coerced or harmed' while filming.

'Everyone has their kinks and we should not shame anyone for enjoying something that is perfectly legal and consensual for all parties involved,' she wrote.

First-hand: In an article on xoJane, Lauren said she had no fear of porn impacting her future career as she wouldn't want to work for anyone who held it against her

'For me, shooting pornography brings me unimaginable joy. When I finish a scene, I know that I have done so and completed an honest day's work. It is my artistic outlet, my love, my happiness, my home.'

Finally, she shot back at critics who claimed she was being degraded: 'I can honestly say that I have never felt more empowered or happy doing anything else.'

Lauren also called for people to examine why they treated female sexuality 'with such disdain,' and dismissed online comments that said her history would prevent her from finding work after graduation.

'I wouldnâ€™t want to work for someone who discriminates against sex workers,' she wrote.
