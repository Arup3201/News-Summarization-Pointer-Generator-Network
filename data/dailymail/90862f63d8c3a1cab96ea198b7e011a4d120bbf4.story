Team news

West Brom

West Brom captain Chris Brunt is in line to return for his side's Boxing Day clash with Manchester City.

The Northern Irishman was unable to make his comeback from a hamstring injury against QPR last weekend but has trained this week.

West Brom boss Alan Irvine will be able to call upon his captain Chris Brunt for the Boxing Day clash

Victor Anichebe (groin) is still not training but fellow forward Georgios Samaras is back after going home to Greece due to a family matter. Graham Dorrans (calf) and Boaz Myhill (illness) missed training on Tuesday but are expected to be available.

Provisional squad: Foster, Myhill, Pocognoli, Gamboa, Dawson, Lescott, McAuley, Yacob, Davidson, Wisdom, Baird, Varela, Gardner, Brunt, Morrison, Dorrans, Mulumbu, Blanco, Sessegnon, Ideye, Berahino, Samaras.

Manchester City

Manchester City are still without strikers Sergio Aguero (knee), Edin Dzeko (calf) and Stevan Jovetic (hamstring) for the Boxing Day trip to West Brom in the Barclays Premier League.

Midfielders James Milner and David Silva could again play in the advanced central roles that proved successful against Crystal Palace last weekend or teenage forward Jose Angel Pozo might get another chance.

Captain Vincent Kompany (hamstring/calf) is also still sidelined but fellow defender Gael Clichy has recovered from a minor knock.

Provisional squad: Hart, Caballero, Zabaleta, Sagna, Demichelis, Mangala, Boyata, Clichy, Kolarov, Silva, Nasri, Navas, Toure, Fernando, Fernandinho, Lampard, Milner, Pozo, Ambrose, Sinclair.

Manchester City's lack of fit strikers means David Silva could play in a more advanced role
