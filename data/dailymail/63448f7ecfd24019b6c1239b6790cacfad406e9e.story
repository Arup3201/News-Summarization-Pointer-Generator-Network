A Texas woman on trial for the death of her 2-month-old son blames severe bipolar disorder for her deplorable actions.

'You will hear from a doctor who believes that 'but-for' the severe 
mental illness suffered by Narjes Modarresi, this tragedy would not have
 occurred,' said Modarresi's defense attorney, George Parnham, in opening statements at the Harris County District Court.

Modarresi, 32, could be sentenced to life without parole if convicted.

Narjes Modarresi, defense claims bipolar disorder drove her to kill her infant son

Prosecutors argue Modarresi's actions were far more calculated.

'She woke up on April 21, 2010 and decided to kill Masih Golabbakhsh,' said Assistant Harris County District Attorney Sunni Mitchell. 'He was a child she never wanted and never loved. He was in her way.'

The baby was her second child. He was killed after being buried facedown in the mud outside West Houston's Buffalo Bayou.

At first, she claimed two men in a beige Chevrolet kidnapped the boy while she walked him in a stroller.

But according to the Houston Chronicle, a neighbor told prosecutors they say her run and crash the stroller, with no baby in it, into a curb on purpose.

Attorney George Parnham believes his client's mental state should be a mitigating factor in sentencing even if she is convicted

She then allegedly called 911 to report the child missing.

After speaking to her neighbors, authorities finally confronted Modarresi who took them to the baby's grave.

Parnham promised to convince jurors his client was unstable with evidence from psychological evaluations, records of two suicide attempts in her teens, and on psychotic episode on the flight home from her native Iran that forced the plane to perform an emergency landing in Qatar.

Her mental health could be a mitigating factor in sentencing.

If convicted of capital murder she will automatically be sentenced to life in prison. But if convicted of a lesser offense like murder, punishments could range from five years to life in prison.
