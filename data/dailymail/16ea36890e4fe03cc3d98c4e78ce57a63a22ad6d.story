More than 100 editors have written to the Prime Minister to protest against controversial laws which allow the police to spy on journalists’ confidential sources, including whistle-blowers.

Campaigners first demanded changes to the rules when it emerged police had secretly launched snooping missions to get the phone records of two journalists investigating alleged wrongdoing by MPs.

They said police should be forced to at least apply to judges before using the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act against reporters.

Ministers insisted they had listened to the concerns and would take action. 

But the proposals unveiled by Home Secretary Theresa May still allow forces to continue to authorise their own applications for journalists’ telecoms data under RIPA. 

Officers must simply give ‘special consideration to necessity and proportionality’ if the application is made for the phone data of a medical doctor, lawyer, reporter, MP or religious minister.

Now the editors of every national newspaper, and scores of regional papers and websites, are backing a letter co-ordinated by Press Gazette and the Society of Editors which warns the rules provide ‘wholly inadequate protection for journalists’ sources’.

The letter states: ‘The mere fact a public official has contacted a newspaper is highly privileged information.

‘That an individual has contacted a lawyer or doctor tells us little. But the fact they have contacted a journalist identifies them as a source and exposes them to recrimination.

‘Public sector whistle-blowers will not come forward to journalists in future if law enforcement agencies have the power to view journalists’ phone records at will.’

Bob Satchwell, of the Society of Editors said: ‘Politicians say that terrorism laws should be used where relevant and proportionate. The police have used RIPA when it was neither. Journalism is not terrorism nor criminal.’
