Its 26-year-old founder has played predictably fast and loose with corporate etiquette, signing off news of Yahoo’s  $1.1billion cash purchase of Tumblr with ‘F*** yeah.’

New boss, Marissa Mayer, is thrilled she says at the deal she describes as her ‘stake in the ground’ as the tech giant’s new CEO.

But amid all the clamour and noise over Yahoo’s purchase of David Karp’s micro-blogging site, Tumblr, one voice has been curiously absent until now - prompting speculation that this much celebrated deal is not universally welcome.

'F*** yeah': When his Tumblr co-developer quit in 2010 David Karp, pictured, claimed he would never sell out three years on he has sold his site for $1.1billion

But
in 2010 he left Karp to ‘pursue independent projects.’

His initial reluctance to comment on the high profile sale of the site has 
re-ignited speculation that the relationship between Karp and Arment
soured in recent years.

When approached directly by MailOnline Arment said: ‘I really don’t want to respond in any way until I post my thoughts on my own site.’

Asked if he was pleased for Karp he simply re-iterated his desire not to comment.

What's next? The retweet that hints at Marco Arment's true feelings over Tumblr's sale?

And while friends, fans and site-users immediately posted on Twitter, Arment waited until the close of the day before issuing a pointedly measured response to the sale, a review of his relationship with Karp and his own role in the creation of the fantastically successful site.

Writing on his own site he admitted: 'I didn't have any advance knowledge of the Yahoo acquisition - I got official confirmation this morning, just like the public. When I read the rumor a few days ago on AllThingsD, I didn't know whether to believe it.'

He continued: 'Generally, what Tumbrl needs, and what Tumblr has always needed, is to get support and maintenance roles off of David's plate so he can focus on the product.'

He described himself as 'optimistic' at the sale, adding, 'This is clearly what David believes is best for his product.'

He doesn’t follow his former boss on Twitter and though he lists his involvement with Tumblr on online profiles he rarely refers to Karp by name since leaving his organisation three years ago.

The new boss: Marissa Mayer, Yahoo CEO who has bought Tumblr with the promise 'not to screw it up'

Arment was just two years out of college when he replied to an advertisement posted by Karp on Craigslist.

Reflecting on that time Karp once said he was ‘just stupid lucky’ to meet Arment in this fashion.

As for Arment he opted for the 
role with Davidville over an offer from Bloomberg though at the time he 
was confused as to exactly who his boss would be.

With no corporate experience to speak 
of, Karp had asked Fred Seibert, the founder of animation production 
company Frederator Studios and a family friend who had offered him an 
internship when he was 15, to sit in on his interview with Arment.

It was during a
lull in client work that Karp and Arment set to work on building the 
tumblelogging tool of Karp’s imagination. What began as a side-project 
took on a life of its own. A 
small group of angel investors came up with $775,000 in return for a 
stake in the site then valued at just $3million. Karp enlisted the help 
of more experienced men; Arment concentrated on making the site work. 

Karp was just 20 years old. He was opposed to advertising, visionary in his determination that his site should not show numbers of followers – an online habit that, he has said, ‘poisons the community’ – and unequivocal in his hope to ‘never sell-out.’

When Arment left Tumblr in 2010 to develop his own successful internet project – Instapaper, a bookmark and reading service – Karp was still holding to that line.

The Yahoo deal has made Karp an extremely wealthy young man and one who certainly need never worry about money again.

'As for me,' Arment writes, 'David was generous with my employee stock options back in the day. I won't make yacht-and-helicopter money from the acquisition, and I won't be switching to decidated day and night iPhones.

'But as long as I manage investments properly and don't spend recklessly, Tumblr has given my family a strong safety net and..the freedom to work on whatever I want.'

It is a decidely restrained response.

And perhaps a clue to Arment’s true feelings on Karp's cashing in can be found in his retweet of a humorous message from a friend.

Referring to Arment’s dog, Hops – an internet character in his own right with a Twitterfeed of his own – the post simply reads: ‘What next @marcoarment? Are you gonna sell @hopsarment too?'

So why is the first man employed by Karp the last to comment on the historic sale?
