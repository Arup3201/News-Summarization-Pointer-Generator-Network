Motorists are being ‘held to ransom’ by petrol prices of up to 16p a litre more on motorways.

Fuel at motorway service stations can be up to 10p per litre more than the national average price, and up to 16p higher than the cheapest prices at local supermarkets, research from the RAC found.

This adds up to £8 to the cost of filling up an average family vehicle.

High prices meant drivers risked ‘running on fumes’ while trying to avoid paying over the odds, the RAC said

The high prices also risked drivers ‘running on fumes’ and breaking down while trying to avoid paying over the odds, the report said.

Calling for prices to be capped to prevent profiteering, the RAC report said drivers ‘should not have to experience this 21st century form of highway robbery’.

Their spot check revealed the worst offender for high fuel prices was the Reading services on the M4 – which was selling BP petrol at 137.9p, while six miles away in Shinfield it cost 121.9p – a difference of 16p per litre.

Buying diesel on the M4 costs an average of 138.9p – 13p more than at the filling station. 

Fuel at motorway service stations (such as this one on the M25) can be up to 10p per litre more than the national average price, and up to 16p higher than the cheapest prices at local supermarkets

RAC spokesman Simon Williams pointed out that the price of fuel at the pumps has fallen to its lowest since January 2011. 

‘It’s no wonder that motorists feel held to ransom with prices on the motorways inflated to such an extent. 

'We can see no reason why motorway fuel should be so much more expensive,’ he said.

‘Prices have come down significantly in recent weeks and we are currently at levels not seen since 2010, but motorway service stations still remain much more expensive.’
