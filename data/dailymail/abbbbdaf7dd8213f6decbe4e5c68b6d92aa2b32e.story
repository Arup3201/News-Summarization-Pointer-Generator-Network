When Alba the labrador was diagnosed with a mysterious illness that has been killing dogs around the country, she was given just hours to live.

Her devastated owners were handed one last hope, however: an eight-hour operation that vets warned might kill her.

But they agreed, desperate to save their beloved pet.

Vets saved 11-month-old labrador Alba after she contracted mystery illness New Forest Syndrome, which killed dozens of pets, by filtering her blood

Clinicians used a treatment called plasmapheresis, which involved draining Alba's blood, pumping it through a machine to filer out the mystery disease, then pumping it back into her body again

Owners warned to watch out for the killer bug

Now the 11-month-old has become the 
first dog to survive New Forest Syndrome, which causes catastrophic 
kidney failure, thanks to the pioneering treatment. Vets at the Queen 
Mother Animal Hospital in Hertfordshire cured Alba by pumping her blood 
through a dialysis machine which filtered out the pathogens that were 
attacking her body.

The 
procedure, known as plasmapheresis, has been carried out on humans since
 the 1950s, but had never before been tried on a dog with New Forest 
Syndrome.

The procedure was 
risky because the machine also removes the clotting agents in the blood 
that would allow the wound to heal, meaning Alba risked bleeding to 
death.

Yesterday, Alba’s delighted owner Rebecca Magee, 49, thanked the vets for saving her beloved pet.

‘It
 was a terrifying experience,’ said Mrs Magee, who lives in Bristol. ‘It
 wasn’t an easy decision. But they made it clear it was her only chance 
of survival, so that made my mind up for me.’

Mrs
 Magee said the procedure cost £6,800 in total, only £4,000 of which was
 covered by her insurance.

‘We were lucky we could afford it,’ she 
added.

‘Even then, it meant we can’t take a holiday this year. If it had
 gone on much longer we would have had to stop treating her eventually. 
But it is hard to put a price on your pet.’

Alba’s case was featured on the BBC2 series Young Vets, which started last night.

She
 first fell ill in April, when she developed lesions all over her legs.

Within a day her kidneys started to fail, and she was soon transferred 
to the Queen Mother Hospital for expert care.

There vets diagnosed her 
with New Forest Syndrome, so called because it was first reported in 
2012 in the forest in Hampshire.

After eight hours hooked up to the machine Alba made a full recovery and is believed to be the first dog in the UK to survive New Forest Syndrome 

Vets are still unsure what causes New Forest Syndrome. Symptoms include lesions on the skin which won't heal, depression, loss of appetite and vomiting followed by kidney failure

Before surgeons treated Alba using the technique, no dog had been known to survive the illness

Since then the mystery disease has spread to Cornwall, Surrey, Worcestershire and County Durham, killing more than 40 dogs.

Dan
 Chan, the vet who treated Alba, said he has already seen six cases at 
the Queen Mother Hospital but had not managed to save any of them.

‘These
 are very early stages of understanding what the disease process is,’ he
 added. ‘Alba was very lucky because her kidney was not yet completely 
destroyed, and she was young and healthy enough to recover.’

Young Vets continues tonight on BBC2 at 7pm.
