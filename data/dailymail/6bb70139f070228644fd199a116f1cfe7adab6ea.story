A suspect was filmed being kicked by a police officer after receiving a 1,200 volt shock from a Taser.

Police have launched an internal investigation after dramatic footage emerged of the male police officer appearing to forcefully kick the man from behind while he was falling to the ground face-first.

He was then heard shouting ‘put your hands up’ - despite the suspect on Brighton seafront in East Sussex being unable to move, because he was disorientated and surrounded by three more officers.

Sussex Police are now carrying out an investigation following the emergence of the footage, which was shot by a passer-by who watched the dramatic scene unfold as he was walking to the shops.

The man, a local businessman who asked not to be named, said: ‘You could see that he clearly had some issues as he started taking his clothes off [when surrounded by officers].

‘There was a lot of shouting and he was saying he had been Tasered before. What concerned me was not the shouting, but the kick that the police officer gave him.

‘He was already going down but to be kicked like that while being Tasered is quite concerning.’

The witness claimed that despite standing on a public highway, a police officer asked him to stop filming. When he carried on, the officer then allegedly stood in his way to block the view.
