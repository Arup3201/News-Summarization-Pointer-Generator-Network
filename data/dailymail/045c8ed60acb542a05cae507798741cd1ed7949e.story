Andy Robertson had hit back at the idea that England will face a physical battle in Scotland on Tuesday.

England and Scotland face each other for the first time in Glasgow since the Euro 2000 play-off in 1999. 

Scotland go into the game on a high having beaten the Republic of Ireland 1-0 on Friday night thanks to a Shaun Maloney goal.

And the Robertson is not concerned with Ben Foster's view Scotland will try and force a physical game on England. 

The England goalkeeper - who is set to replace Joe Hart - said Scotland and Ireland players were 'kicking lumps out of each other' on Friday.

But Hull defender Robertson said: 'That's his opinion. We were the ones trying to play football. Just look at the goal it's sheer passing, straight from the training ground, and Shaun's finish unbelievable.'

Robertson, 20, admits he can't remember Paul Scholes' double at Hampden Park 15 years ago as England won 2-0 but says he watched last year's Wembley friendly game while in digs in Dundee having just signed for Dundee Utd.

He added: 'When I was growing up Scotland-England was already a thing of the past but we heard all about it. It will be a competitive game.'
