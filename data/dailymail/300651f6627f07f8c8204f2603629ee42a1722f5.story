Prince Harry has promised to throw a party for stunning Olympic swimmer Missy Franklin.

Harry met the statuesque US star at the Warrior Games in Colorado during his recent trip to the US and even joined in singing to her on her 18th birthday.

'They had a long chat about Missy's decision to go to college for only two years so she can focus on the 2016 Olympics,' said my US spy.

'Hitting it off': Prince Harry met swimming star Missy Franklin on his recent tour of the U.S.

'It ended with Harry promising a big do in honour of her winning four gold medals last year. They really hit it off.

'Harry likes collecting attractive young womenÂ  as friends.'

Prince Harry asked Franklin, attending the event with her parents, for a rundown of her medals.

The swimming sensation later tweeted about her encounter with the royal well-wisher: 'And the perfect way to end my 18th birthday!?

'Meeting Prince Harry! It was a honor meeting him and I had a blast as always.'

The American teenager blitzed the world's best to claim gold in the 100m and 200m backstroke, 4 x 200m freestyle and 4 x 100 m medley at the Olympics.

Franklin also broke two world records at last summers' games.

He was there to see how a garden he is supporting for his charity is blooming and wore a high visibility jacket as he arrived at the west London site.

Prince Harry spent several minutes talking to designer Jinny Blom as he was shown around the B&Q Sentebale garden - set up to promote the charity he founded with Prince Seeiso of Lesotho.
