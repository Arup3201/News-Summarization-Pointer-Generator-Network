Junior Cooper, 35, has been jailed for nine years for targeting professional women who were walking home alone in London

The leader of a gang of muggers, who attacked and snatched handbags from professional women who were walking home alone at night, has been jailed for nine years.

Junior Cooper, 35, from Queens Park, north west London, and his accomplices pounced from behind and choked their victims in three violent attacks in central London last year. 

One victim, pianist Susanne Suhonen suffered a broken finger and may never be able to play properly again.

Another victim was choked with her own silk scarf, while the third victim was dragged along the street when she refused to let go of her handbag.  

Sentencing him to nine years in prison, Judge Michael Grieve said: ‘Extreme planning was involved in all the robberies. Women on their own likely to have valuable goods were targeted.’

Cooper - who was jailed in 2009 for a spate of robberies - drove the gang around in a stolen Audi looking for vulnerable women, the court was told. 

One victim, Jacqueline Hurst, had just parked her car near her home in Marylebone at 10.30pm in November 2013 when she was attacked by the thugs.

One of the men grabbed her around the waist, while another choked the woman with her scarf, Southwark Crown Court heard.

She was knocked to the ground during the robbery and is still traumatised.

In a statement to the court, she said: ‘Before the attack I was a confident girl, happy, fun and totally unfazed by city living.

‘Everything has changed and I am half the woman I used to be. At all times day or night I am looking behind myself.’

Ms Hurst added that she now has to wait for her boyfriend to escort her from her car. She also has to sit or stand with her back to a wall when she is out in public, fearing she will be grabbed from behind.

About half an hour after that attack, Sarah Lewishon was targtted as she walked from her car to her house in St John’s Wood, north London.

She was also grabbed around the neck but refused to let go of her handbag and was dragged along the ground. Ms Lewishon now suffers severe neck pain and is terrified to go out at night alone.

Eleven day later, Ms Suhonen was attacked by the gang as she walked home. 

She told the court she was unable to sleep for about two weeks after the attack and that she kept having nightmares.

She said: ‘I had to open my eyes and I didn’t want to close them for fear of seeing the same scenes again - needless to say I was exhausted in my domestic life and at work.’

Cooper was jailed at Southwark Crown Court for nine years, after being found guilty of conspiracy to rob

Tom Nicholson, prosecuting, said: ‘She fractured her finger on her right hand, which healed crooked, due to the fracture and the way the position of the tendon, she is unable to have it straightened.

‘She might not be able to play the piano properly with that hand again. Her wrist was inflamed and extremely painful. She had to postpone her piano exam for one year because of her injuries.’

Cooper and his accomplice Remy McLeod were convicted after a trial in July this year of conspiracy to rob.

McLeod refused to come to court from prison today and will be sentenced on 9 September.

Martin Sharpe, defending, said Cooper has a history of crack cocaine abuse, but has started to face up to his addiction problems in prison.

He said: ‘He is not someone who is hopeless, he’s not without personal charm, not without personal warmth and not without hope.’ 

Cooper was on licence at the time of the offences and will serve the remaining three years of his 2009 sentence concurrently.
