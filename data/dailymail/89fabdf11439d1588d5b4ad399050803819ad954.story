Before discussing Rory McIlroy’s latest wonder round at the DP World Tour Championship it’s worth stressing that the Earth Course measures almost 7,700 yards and more than a third of the field comprising the European Tour’s top 60 golfers failed to break par.

McIlroy, who has never shot worse than the regulation mark in 21 rounds here dating back to 2009, shot a bogey-free 66 to be tied for the lead with Irishman Shane Lowry after the first day and lower his course average to 68.2 strokes. To put that utterly ludicrous figure into context, only six players managed to better that mark on Tuesday.

This was the world No 1’s sixth score of 66, to place alongside five 67s, two 68s, two 69s, five 71s and that solitary 72. Again, for the purposes of perspective, Sergio Garcia shot 73, Ian Poulter 75, while recent tour winners Mikko Ilonen, Marcel Siem and Brooks Koepka shot 74, 76 and 78 respectively. Yes, on the Earth Course McIlroy really is otherworldly.

McIlroy had suggested in the build-up that six weeks away from the game would sharpen his appetite rather than dull his competitive edge and so it proved.

Remember the start he made to his singles match at the Ryder Cup, where he blew Rickie Fowler away in the first few holes? Here we had more of the same, and five holes worth of shot-making to begin with that illustrated once more why he has moved several strides ahead of the competition during this stellar year.

Standing on the sixth tee, he was already breathing down the necks of the leaders. He was four under par and would have been five but for a missed birdie putt from short length at the third.

Sometimes, though, it’s the putts for par that are far more important. One came at the difficult 12th where, following a relatively humdrum run of six straight pars, he was actually in danger of dropping a stroke. But a beautifully played pitch left him a six-foot putt, which he holed.

McIlroy returned to the birdie trail with 12-foot putts at the 15th and 16th. Now he is threatening to effectively wrap up the destination of this title before the 72nd hole on Sunday, having completed formalities already in the Race to Dubai.

Why does this course suit him so? It’s a bomber’s paradise, pure and simple, and no-one pounds it longer and straighter than McIlroy. As his playing partner Henrik Stenson — no slouch himself — said: ‘With his length he was able to take on a couple of carries I couldn’t manage and, as he was in position A1 pretty much all day, it gave him a huge advantage.’

McIlroy could hardly contain his enthusiasm in the build-up to the first round. ‘Just under three hours until I hit my first competitive golf shot in six weeks. To say I’m excited is an understatement,’ he tweeted, complete with the daring hashtag: #imready.

Well, daring until he’d played the first five holes anyway, and showed he was more than ready.

Much of McIlroy’s time away was spent preparing legal documents for a forthcoming courtroom showdown with his former management company, Horizon Sports. How ironic, then, that the only man who should match him on this day was Horizon- managed Lowry. Lowry is 52nd in the world and needs a good finish here to break into the top 50 and secure a first invitation to the Masters. He’s squandered a couple of good opportunities already in recent weeks and admitted: ‘It has been on my mind for a while.’

It certainly did not show down the run-in here, as he picked up four shots in the final six holes.

One man who will not be conceding the title to McIlroy at this stage is in-form defending champion Stenson, who shot 68.

Comeback of the day came from Englishman Justin Rose, who played the first 10 holes in a horrible four over but the last eight in five under to salvage a 71.
