It was never going to do much for cross-Channel relations.

But David Cameron’s suggestion that 
wealthy Frenchmen should escape their country’s high taxes by moving to 
Britain has left Paris rather, well, hopping mad.

French politicians have responded by 
criticising Britain’s health and education system and accusing the Prime
Minister of wanting to establish a UK ‘tax haven’. They also implied 
that Mr Cameron was drunk when he made his offer.

Green and pleasant land: David Cameron promised to welcome rich French citizens with open arms as Francois Hollande prepared to raise taxes

The Prime Minister promised to 
welcome anyone looking to escape a 75 per cent top rate of tax, which is
set to be introduced by France’s new socialist president Francois 
Hollande.

This week Mr Cameron told a business 
summit in Mexico: ‘If the French go ahead with a 75 per cent top rate of
tax we will roll out the red carpet and welcome more French businesses 
to Britain, and they can pay tax in Britain and pay for our Health 
Service and schools and everything else.’

French socialist MP Claude Bartalone 
replied: ‘I hope it was an after-dinner remark and that he didn’t have 
all his wits about him when he said these things, because it’s just not 
the done thing.

‘He can’t have had his wits about him 
because if he had, he would have paid more attention to all those 
Europeans who go to work in England but who come for medical treatment 
in France, and who put their children in French schools because there 
are no more public services in England.’

Employers’ federation chairman 
Laurence Parisot added: ‘I don’t want French businesses to walk on this 
red carpet. There is no way that the entrepreneurial spirit should be 
monopolised by our British friends.’

The leader of the Communist Party, 
Pierre Laurent, said ‘Britain’s ambition to be Europe’s tax haven’ was 
‘sad’. Chancellor George Osborne lowered the top rate of tax from 50p to
45p in this year’s Budget.

A Downing Street spokesman stressed 
that the Prime Minister had been making a ‘serious point about having a 
competitive tax policy’, while a source close to Mr Cameron branded Mr 
Bartalone’s comments as a ‘ridiculous outburst’.

The jibes about the Prime Minister’s 
dining habits follow embarrassing claims in a new biography that he 
spends a significant amount of time ‘chillaxing’ and enjoys several 
glasses of wine with his lunch.

It recently emerged that he left his eight-year-old daughter Nancy in a pub in Buckinghamshire after a long Sunday meal.

Britain’s relationship with France was already strained, even before Mr Hollande’s election victory last month.

Mr Cameron had snubbed the socialist 
when he was in opposition, choosing instead to rub shoulders with the 
man he ousted, Nicolas Sarkozy.

The nations are also divided on the best way to deal with the recession.

Mr Hollande, who describes himself as 
an ‘enemy of finance’, announced massive increases in public spending to
be funded by a tax hike.

Those earning more than €1million (£800,000) a year will pay 75 per cent tax.
