As DIY disasters go, this one is pretty hard to beat.

A hapless Chinese homeowner was left wishing he'd called in the professionals after his entire house collapsed around him during an ill-advised attempt to demolish it himself.  

The 44-year-old man, named only as Yiburaymu, was planning to use his life savings to build anew home on the plot in Liangtai village near Bole, in western China.

Spot of bother? Chinese home owner Yiburaymu became trapped under the debris of his house following a an ill-advised attempt to demolish it himself

Tight squeeze: Yiburaymu was planning to use his life savings to build a new home on the plot in Liangtai village near Bole, in western China

Yiburaymu was left trapped under a mountain of rubble when the house suddenly collapsed due to
the heavy cement ceiling and fragile walls.

He was left buried
underneath a mountain of rubble, with only his head and one hand outside. Firefighters arrived to find that he was stuck by six
falling cement ceiling plates.

After the called-in crane lifted out the plates,
Yiburaymu was dug out from the debris, and was taken to hospital in an
ambulance.

Luckily he was only found to have a ruptured tendon on
the left foot, and is not in danger.

Rescue: Emergency workers hoist concrete slabs as they race to free 
the 44-year-old Yiburaymu

Hang-on: Yiburaymu clings to a rope attached to part of his house as he tries to stop himself slipping down into the rubble

Freed: Yiburaymu is carried away on a stretcher after finally being rescued from the remains of his home. Luckily his only injury was a ruptured tendon in his left foot
