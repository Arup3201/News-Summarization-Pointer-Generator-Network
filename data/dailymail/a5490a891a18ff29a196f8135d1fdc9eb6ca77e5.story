An astonishing £3billion portfolio of luxurious homes is set to be created by a huge sell-off of London embassies, it emerged today.

Twenty diplomatic missions and residences have been readied for sale in the past half a year - and more are on the way as foreign governments try to cash in demand from wealthy buyers.

The majority of the properties are expected to be converted into apartments in central areas of the capital such as Belgravia, Kensington and Holland Park, reported the London Evening Standard.

Pricey: Some £40million was raised by the sale of the old Brazilian embassy (left) in Mayfair and the seven-storey Canadian High Commission (right) in the same area is expected to be sold soon for £175million

Venetia van Kuffeler, The Diplomat magazine editor, told the newspaper: ‘Dating back to the Victorian era, grand embassy buildings used to be an important visual representation of each country.

‘However with the internet and 24 hour news that isn’t so necessary as people now know a lot more about countries from around the world.’

Just this week the former European Council of Foreign Relations eight-storey building near St James’s Park was sold for £21.5million to Galliard Homes and will be converted into 35 apartments.

These could be worth a combined £100million, with the developer saying that diplomatic buildings are full of impressive décor and spacious interiors thanks to them being ‘built to impress’.

The former Montserrat embassy in Marylebone has already been converted into flats by Galliard.

Some
£40million was raised by the sale of the old Brazilian embassy in 
Mayfair - and the diplomatic homes of countries including Greece, 
Tajikistan and Kazakhstan are also expected to be relocated.

Changes: The American embassy is moving from Grosvenor Square (left) to a new £600 million site in Nine Elms (right) in four years, with its current building sold to the Qatari royal family’s property development arm

Expensive: Indian steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal owns a building on 'billionaires row' Kensington Palace Gardens, which is a combination of the former Egyptian and Russian embassies

Peter Wetherell of Wetherell agents told the Standard that the Brazilian sale ‘has heightened awareness in the diplomatic community that the missions are sitting on a property gold mine’.

Another property expected to be sold soon is the seven-storey Canadian High Commission in Mayfair, which first went on the market for £50million in 1999 - but could now go for an eye-watering £175million.

The US embassy is moving from Grosvenor Square to a new £600million site in Nine Elms in four years, with its current building sold to the Qatari royal family’s property development arm.

And it is thought up to five buildings are being considered for sale on ‘billionaires row’ Kensington Palace Gardens - which is full of diplomatic buildings - and could go for a combined £500million.

Indian steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal, 63, owns a building on the road, which is a combination of the former Egyptian and Russian embassies.
