When the Atlanta Falcons take the field at Wembley Stadium for their game on Sunday against the Detroit Lions they’ll hope to have homefield advantage despite being about 4,200 miles away from the Georgia Dome.

For the second game of the 2014 National Football League International Series they will play ‘host’ to the Lions on Sunday afternoon.

Atlanta (2-5) are very much the underdog with only one victory away from the Georgia Dome in the past two seasons. The Falcons have lost four in a row after winning two of their first three games. Meanwhile, the favoured Lions (5-2) have won their last two road games and are on the back of a two-game winning streak.

The Lions and Falcons have played 35 times overall, including their first-ever meeting in 1966, and Detroit has won the lion’s share of the match-ups with 23 victories. However, Atlanta has won the last three meetings between the teams and outscored Detroit by a combined margin of 88 to 55.

The tables might be turned on Sunday as the Falcons have struggled to score points this season under the leadership of head coach Mike Smith. This is the seventh season the 55-year-old has been on the sidelines for the Falcons and he has a 62-41 record overall. However, Smith has only won a single playoff game in four postseason appearances and there have been rumblings that his job is on the line. A win on Sunday against the NFC North leaders would certainly help his cause.

Smith may be in luck because Detroit All-Pro wide receiver Calvin Johnson is uncertain to suit up on Sunday. Johnson, who holds the NFL record for most receiving yards in a season with 1,964, has been dealing with an ankle issue and has missed the past two games. If Johnson is unable to go, it will be a big break for Atlanta’s defense, a unit that has already surrendered 1,921 passing yards this year, second-most in the NFL.

When the teams take the field for London’s first daytime NFL game it will be 9.30am Eastern time in the US. The early start time in the States means fans can watch the NFL morning, noon and night in four separate Sunday timeslots. Although the Sunday morning kickoff may interfere with breakfast plans in Atlanta and Detroit, the earlier start is not expected to affect attendance and the Lions and Falcons will likely be playing in front of a packed house.

The first NFL match-up at Wembley in 2014, which saw the Miami Dolphins trounce the Oakland Raiders 38-14, was played in front of 83,436 fans. Tickets for Sunday’s game sold out quickly and the final 2014 NFL game at Wembley on November 6 between the Cowboys and the Jacksonville Jaguars has already sold out as well.

The Falcons arrived at Gatwick on Monday morning and will be practicing at the Arsenal Training Centre this week. ‘Good morning, London. The Falcons are here! #UKFalcons #RiseUp,’ the team tweeted out on Monday.

Detroit arrived earlier today and players and coaches from both teams will be participating in various functions including an NFL Fan Rally at 12.pm on Saturday in Trafalgar Square. The rally, which drew more than 40,000 fans last year, will feature food, drink, music, dance acts and appearances by ex-NFL players and other special guests.
