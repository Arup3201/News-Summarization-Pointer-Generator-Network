A firefighter thought he could solve his dental problems without spending a fortune by having surgery in Budapest.

But the money he saved ended up causing more trouble than it was worth after his teeth began to fall out following a botched operation.

Stephen Carter, 53, needed dentures due to decades of drinking fizzy drinks and a fear of the dentist that meant he delayed getting his decaying teeth fixed.

He then got into a play fight at work that caused his false teeth to break, leaving him with just five teeth.

The firefighter admits his toothless smile left him self-conscious about his appearance.

He said: 'I didn't smile as much as I used to. I used to have a nice smile in my younger days.'

His girlfriend, Sarah Groves, added: 'He became quite withdrawn with it, he didn't want to speak out loud with it. He became very conscious of his teeth all the time.'

The firefighter had just five teeth and dentures he had fitted in Budapest kept breaking and falling out

Stephen lived with the problem for two years as he investigated how it could be solved.

He couldn't afford to have the surgery in Britain so he looked at having it done aboard and discovered it would cost half as much.

He recalled: 'The prices in Britain were between £16,000 and £21,000 which I thought was a lot of money.

'I found a surgery in Budapest that offered cheap implants and free accommodation. It took me a long time to actually decide to go for it. They offered me a discount of £500 if I paid in cash.'

He opted for a fixed palate with a lifetime guarantee which cost £6,500 upfront in cash.

'Over the last 10 years, we're seeing more 
and more the results of disasters which are emanating from cosmetic 
surgery tourism'

Stephen said: 'The teeth were actually taken out in London and then I went to Budapest for surgery. It was very professional, and it all looked very clean, very hygienic. Immediately afterwards my teeth were good, strong and I had a nice smile.'

However three months later, he was horrified when one of the teeth broke off completely when he munched a chocolate bar.

'I bit into a Mars bar and thought, this is a bit crunchy, this Mars bar. I pulled the bit out and it was a bit of tooth,' he said.

He contacted the company in Budapest and was given a replacement tooth but three weeks later, another one fell out and then yet another.

Soon the whole bridge holding his teeth snapped. Even though he had a 'lifetime guarantee' he was told he would have to return to Hungary at his own cost to have a replacement, which he would also have to pay for.

The replacement eventually snapped too and Stephen was left worse off than he was before and down £10,000.

When he complained, he was only given a 25 per cent refund.

Patrick Mallucci, a consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon based in the UK, said Stephen is one of many victims of inadequate and unscrupulous surgeons who tempt Brits aboard with discount deals.

He said: 'Over the last 10 years, we're seeing more 
and more the results of disasters which are emanating from cosmetic 
surgery tourism.'

An exasperated Stephen said he now didn't know what to do: 'I'd like a nice set of teeth. I'd 
like to be able to properly smile again with confidence, to properly eat
 again. It would mean the world to me to have my teeth fixed.'

His salvation finally came after he appeared on Channel 5 show Botched Up Bodies: Aboard and was given the teeth he'd always wanted by cosmetics surgeon Dr Adam Slade.

Delighted with the results, he said: 'I think I've got an excellent smile now. My teeth fit together when I bite - there's no rocking or anything. I'm really, really impressed! It's made me good-looking again.'
