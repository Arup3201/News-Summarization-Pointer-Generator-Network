Wealthy pensioners should be stripped of universal benefits such as free bus passes, Nick Clegg suggested yesterday.

Anyone with assets of more than £1million could lose out on payments including the winter fuel allowance and free TV licences.

The Deputy Prime Minister insisted age-related payments would be protected for the duration of this Parliament. But he indicated they could be curbed afterwards.

Idea: Nick Clegg, pictured with his wife Miriam yesterday in Brighton, said wealthy pensioners should be stripped of universal benefits such as free bus passes

Mr Clegg said the welfare budget could not be ‘immune’ from the swingeing cuts aimed at reducing Britain’s budget deficit. The controversial plans are expected to be included in the Liberal Democrat manifesto at the next General Election, due in 2015.

But some senior Lib Dems are calling for them to come sooner. Mr Clegg’s comments follow demands for a £2million ‘mansion tax’ for the ‘stinking rich’ and Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander’s warning that the Government would go after tax dodgers. David Cameron promised to retain free bus passes during the live television debates between the party leaders before the last election.

But Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith wants an end to universal benefits for the elderly to help shave £10billion from the welfare budget.

Mr Clegg said it would be ‘very difficult to explain’ if low earners lost state help while better-off pensioners continued to receive universal benefits. Middle class parents are already due to lose their child benefit payments next year.

‘It would be quite interesting if you could ask the Labour party for this, because they appear to be saying that at a time when people’s housing benefit is being cut, we should protect Alan Sugar’s free bus pass,’ Mr Clegg told Radio 4.

He said that the Coalition Agreement ruled out changing age-related universal benefits, but that would change ‘in the future’.

But one of his ministers called for cuts to be made immediately. Local Government Minister Don Foster told  Radio 5 Live: ‘It’s not yet Liberal Democrat policy, it’s something we’ll work on. But you know, if there is something that can be done now then we need to get the economy moving now, not just put it in a Liberal Democrat manifesto for 2015.

‘If we can get something like this implemented now then that would be better.’

Former Lib Dem Treasury spokesman Lord Oakeshott added that Mr Cameron should take a ‘hit’ by axing universal benefits for the elderly.

Unhappy: Nick Clegg said it would be difficult to defend the state giving a free bus pass to wealthy pensioners like businessman and TV star Lord Sugar

He said: ‘I’ve been raising these questions about winter fuel payments going to people who don’t need them, whether they are sipping Sangria in the sun in Seville or people like me in their 60s with good jobs: why at least should these not be taxed?

'If you start means-testing pensioner benefits, many of those who need help will not get it, as they won’t claim, it will cost huge sums in administration and you will be penalising those who have saved'

‘Nick has bravely taken hits for the Coalition team on tuition fees and the NHS, for example, why on earth can’t David Cameron at least accept that if we’re all in it together, rich pensioners in good jobs should take the hit too? Why aren’t we fighting for fairness on well-off pensioners’ perks now rather than waiting for 2015?’ 

But Ros Altmann, of Saga, warned: ‘If you start means-testing pensioner benefits, many of those who need help will not get it, as they won’t claim, it will cost huge sums in administration and you will be penalising those who have saved.’

Later Mr Clegg shot down Mr Foster’s calls for the change to happen before 2015. He said: ‘He’s wrong and it’s not going to happen in this Parliament, and I cannot stress enough that what I mean is people, who are very wealthy indeed, receive off millions of ordinary taxpayers across this country free bus passes, TV licences and winter fuel support; even though they frankly don’t need it.’

Fight: Nick Clegg, who yesterday visited the Red Roaster Coffee Shop in Brighton, is preparing to do battle with the Tories over cuts to the welfare bill

Last night Lord Sugar, 65, hit back at
Mr Clegg’s comments – saying he didn’t even have a bus pass and that Mr
Clegg was an ‘idiot’ and a ‘twit’.

'Idiot. Even if I did have a bus pass, I’ve personally paid tens of millions in tax, my companies hundreds of millions in the past 45 years. What has Clegg done?'

Lord Sugar

The Labour peer tweeted: ‘The twit 
Nick Clegg moaning about me having a bus pass. Idiot. I haven’t got one.
Even if I did have a bus pass, I’ve personally paid tens of millions in
tax, my companies hundreds of millions in the past 45 years. What has 
Clegg done.’

The attack on 
universal benefits is the Liberal Democrats’ latest plan to target 
wealthy Britons.  The party was yesterday reported to be looking at 
increasing council tax on multi-million pound homes by creating 
additional bands for properties worth over £1million.
