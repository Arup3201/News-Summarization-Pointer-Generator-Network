A web button has been created that scans websites for abusive comments and replaces the negative words with more positive ones.

For example, angry words such as 'hate' are replaced with words including 'love' or 'kittens'.

The button is a plugin that can be downloaded on the Chrome or Safari browser and was inspired by the torrent of abuse directed to magazine GQ after they ran a series of One Direction covers.

An online button has been designed by V Energy to replace abusive comments on websites with positive 'words of love'. It scans for swear words or negative language on Twitter, pictured, and YouTube and replaces them with words including cupcake and delicious puppies

The GQ debacle with One Direction fans kicked off on Twitter earlier this week.

The bands exclusive interview with GQ
 magazine was classed as 'their most revealing to date', but One 
Direction's devoted fans weren't happy with how their idols were 
portrayed.

Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Louis 
Tomlinson, Liam Payne and Niall Horan were unveiled as the latest cover 
stars for the publication this week, with topics discussed in the 
accompanying interview including bisexual rumours, groupies and their 
tangled love lives.

And since the publication of the 
interview, the magazine has experienced a major backlash from dedicated 
Directioners, who bombarded the GQ Twitter account with a string of  foul-mouthed and abusive messages.

There are similar plugins available already that can block out all mentions of Justin Bieber, for example, as well as James Corden or the Royal baby.

It works by using a database of negative and positive words.

Swear words, as well as words such as 'hate', 'stupid' and 'punch' are classed as negative.

Words such as 'rainbow', 'unicorn' candyfloss', 'hug' and so on are classed as positive words.

The VQ-Hab de-troller is part of V Energy drinks V-Hab.com’s Silence The Troll campaign that uses a comment converter to make internet trolls appear less angry or aggressive.

The anti-trolling browser extension works with Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.

A V-hab.com spokesperson said, 'We 
Love British GQ, but boy did those poor souls not know what they were 
getting themselves into!

'Luckily for them, at V-hab we’re all
 about countering trolls with a bit of positive energy so we’ve created 
VQ-hab to take some heat of those poor journalists and try and inject a 
bit of humour and positivity into what has clearly been a rather large 
misunderstanding on all sides.'

Not so lucky: GQ's Twitter account was subjected to a barrage of abuse thanks to its One Direction cover

VQ-hab has taken the most notable tweets in the original GQ article and run them through the anti-trolling comment converter to show what the internet could look like if everyone was just a bit more positive and understanding.

The GQ debacle with One Direction fans kicked off on Twitter earlier this week.

The bands exclusive interview with GQ magazine was classed as 'their most revealing to date', but One Direction's devoted fans weren't happy with how their idols were portrayed.

Since the publication of the interview, the magazine has experienced a major backlash from dedicated Directioners, who bombarded the GQ Twitter account with a string of often foul-mouthed and abusive messages.
