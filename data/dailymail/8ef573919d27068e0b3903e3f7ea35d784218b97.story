A leading Islamic community leader has revealed two of the four Sydney brothers who have gone to Syria to fight for the Islamic State are 'obese' weighing in at over 140kg amid fears they might be snubbed by fellow terrorists if they eat all their rations.  

Dr Jamal Rifi, said the boys would not make good foot soldiers for the terror group, instead he believes they will be used for propaganda videos.

The boy's from western Sydney, who all lived at home with their parents, sent their shocked mother a one line text message saying they had arrived safely in Syria, she thought it was a cruel joke.

The message read: 'We made it to Bilad al-Sham, we will see you in Paradise.'

One of the boys who works had initially told the mother that he won dour tickets to Thailand and he was going to take his brothers with him. 

Dr Rifi told radio station 2UE: 'The family is distraught, their main concern is to initiate contact, the concern are not concerned how they were radicalised but that they want them to come back.

'We are hoping the fact that because two of them are quite obese they will not good foot soldiers, they are over 140 kg. 

Dr Jamal Rifi said he was in daily contact with the family,he revealed two of the brothers are over 140kg and would not make good foot soldiers for IS

'People are going to realise what are we going to do with them? Are they going to eat al the food and you can't even run on the field.' 

Dr Rifi said the family was trying to get messages to the boys but they had not responded and had probably had their mobile phones confiscated by IS.  

He explained the family had given all the information to the authorities who were trying to 'put the pieces of the puzzle together'. 

The boy's mother is of Lebanese descent and their father is a taxi driver, they also have another brother and sister living at home. 

Dr Rifi added they were 'simple boys' who could not organise trip properly, he revealed the boys had missed the first flight they had booked and had to re-book one for the next day. 

He said: 'They have no life experience. They (the parents) had no idea what their kids were planning such a move, these are ordinary kids who live at home, they showed no sign of radicalisation.'  

The fifth son went to meet the flight that was coming in from Thailand on Saturday, hoping it was a joke. 

Dr Rizi said the family had alerted the authorities to the boy's departure and it was now up to them to 'put the pieces of the puzzle together'.  

It emerged on Saturday authorities had tracked the brothers - who lived in south-west Sydney - as far as Turkey and alerted the family last week. 

But it was believed they had crossed the border and ended up in Bilad al-Sham - a region in Syria.

Family friend and Muslim community leader Dr Jamal Rifi told AAP the family had thought the message was a joke.

'The family didn't know what to make of it... They got scared and deleted the SMS,' Dr Rifi said.

The mother even went to Sydney airport the next day to pick up her sons who were meant to have been on a holiday in Thailand, but they never arrived. 

The sons, 17, 23, 25 and 28, are believed to be the latest group of young Australians who have joined IS militants in Syria. 

The mother has pleaded with them to come home, 9News reported.

'My sons, you are dear to us,' she said in a statement.

'You are good at heart. You have done nothing wrong.

'We want you back. I can't stop crying day and night. We love you all.'

Authorities argue they need more tools to monitor suspects and prevent them from being radicalised

It is understood the 17-year-old was studying for his HSC at a public high school and the older brothers had stable jobs before they left.

Unlike some before them, the siblings were 'clean-skins' and had not been on any watch-lists that would have alerted immigration controls.

Dr Rifi said the family had no inclination the boys were at risk of joining IS.

'The boys are simple boys,' he said.

'They are religiously involved but not hardline or radical.' 

Dr Rifi said social media was playing a big role in the recruitment of these young Sydney men but there had to be someone manipulating the situation face-to-face.

'... and providing contact information through the networks and how to cross the border,' he said.

The four boys, one of whom still attended school, lived at home with their teenage sister, according The Sunday Telegraph. 

Their family home have been searched by police.

Earlier this week on Thursday, Australian Federal Police commissioner Neil Gaughan told a parliamentary committee that the group of four that managed to leave the country this week were 'not on anyone's radar', The Guardian reported.

'We got wind of it after the fact, but the fact is there are still people travelling,' said Gaughan, the national manager of counter-terrorism for the Australian Federal Police,' he said. 

Authorities were alerted last Saturday when the family contacted a member of a local community after they failed to hear from their boys since they fled the country, News Corp reported.

On Saturday, Immigration Minister Scott Morrison confirmed the family was seeking his help but unfortunately, it was too late.

'Australia has lost yet another four young kids. This is why we are so adamant in trying to prevent people leaving to join these foreign fighters', Mr Morrison told The Daily Telegraph.

It follows the disappearance of 'ginger' jihadist Abdullah Elmir from his Bankstown home in Sydney's south-west in June and made his way to the Middle East.

The 17-year-old gained notoriety when he declared that ISIS will not stop their murderous campaign 'until the black flag is flying high in every single land' in the YouTube video.

According to The Daily Telegraph, counter terrorism officers have been deployed to all Australian international airports.

This comes just days ahead of the G20 summit to be held in Brisbane, which will be attended by a large number of world leaders.

Police commissioner Neil Gaughan also told the committee he believed federal police officers needed greater controls urgently, so they were better able to track the movements and interactions of suspects.

'But the fact is there’s still people travelling and regardless of what we’re doing, we’re not stopping that so we need some other tools,' he said, according to the Telegraph.

Though he did not reveal from where or to what destination the group travelled, Gaughan said officers are now virtually powerless to stop them unless they resurface elsewhere.

'Unfortunately, once they get into Syria or into Iraq, there is nothing the AFP can do except wait for them to basically pop their head up somewhere on the way back.' 

Gaughan was speaking at an investigation into new legislation which aims to give security agencies power to issue control orders on people who are enabling or supporting terrorism.

He also revealed that authorities were struggling to keep up with the sheer number of people being radicalised in such a short time - often less than six months.

Authorities said the ability to put restrictions on who suspects can communicate with and where they can go would allow them to greatly reduce the change of an attack on home soil.

There are now more than 60 Australians known to be fighting in foreign conflicts.
