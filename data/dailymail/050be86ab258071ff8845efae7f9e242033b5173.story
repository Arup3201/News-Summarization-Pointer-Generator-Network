Argentina boss Alejandro Sabella has admitted Lionel Messi was right to go public with his criticism of the coach's tactics.

Messi was unhappy Sabella played with five defenders in their World Cup opener against Bosnia-Herzegovina - it was only at half-time, after the coach reverted to the usual 4-3-3 formation, that Argentina began to look impressive.

Argentina face Iran in Belo Horizonte in their second Group F game and Sabella insisted that Messi had been right to speak out.

Outspoken! Lionel Messi has questioned Alejandro Sabella's tactics in their opening World Cup game

Sabella told a news conference: 'I was not hurt by Leo's comment and he has said that before.

'He likes to play 4-3-3 with (Angel) Di Maria up front.

'He was asked how he likes to play and he answered what he thinks in a respectful way. We respect each other, we have a very strong team spirit. It is good to have an open dialogue with my players.

'Sometimes players learn from us the coaches and sometimes we learn from them.

'We can all make mistakes you know. On Sunday we will start with a 4-3-3 formation and we will take it from there. We may have to change the formation or not.'

It was only after the change against Bosnia that Argentina started playing fluently, culminating in an excellent individual goal by Messi, who said a 4-3-3 formation makes it much easier for him and fellow striker Sergio Aguero.

Messi said: 'As strikers we prefer that system as it gives us more attacking opportunities and if we don't use that system we suffer a bit.

'We as strikers favour that line-up. In the first half I was often on my own and so was Kun (Aguero) and it was very difficult, so there are things to be improved on.'

Sabella said he had no issue with Messi going public over this concerns.

'I am the one who encouraged Messi to (say that) and I fully trust all my players from a human and professional standpoint,' he said.

'We have a two-way street in our dialogue because if you don't let them say what they want to say then you won't get the best out of them.'

Iran drew 0-0 against Nigeria in their opening game but coach Carlos Queiroz admitted they were up against it.

He said: 'It will require a miracle since Argentina is one of the best teams in the world and also they have one day of rest more than we do.'
