Dressed only in their underwear and provocatively holding weapons for the camera, they appear to be having a great time posing for photographs in their barracks room.

But four Israeli female soldiers have now been disciplined by the country's military for their 'unbecoming behaviour' after the raunchy pictures were posted on Facebook.

The images, published on Israeli news website Walla, showed the soldiers removing their fatigues to expose their underwear and backsides.

In another, five women posed in what 
appeared to be a barracks room, dressed only in helmets and a small 
amount of combat equipment.

Walla, which blurred the faces of the women, said they were new recruits stationed on a base in southern Israel.

The
 incident is the latest in a string of episodes involving young Israeli 
soldiers on social media that have drawn reprimand from the military.

In
 a statement, the military said the women had acted in a manner showing 'unbecoming behaviour' for Israeli soldiers, adding: 'The commanding officers disciplined the soldiers as they saw fitting.'

The statement did not identify the soldiers or give any details about the punishments. Military officials said the base conducted educational lectures to keep soldiers from repeating the offence.

Several times in recent years, the Israeli military has disciplined soldiers for what were considered improper postings in social media sites.

Last year, the social media chief for the Israel Defence Force was branded 'racist' after posting a picture on Facebook of his face covered in mud alongside the caption 'Obama style'.

Lt. Sacha Dratwa faced a barrage of abuse for the picture, which appeared to show him swimming in the Dead Sea, and denied he was racist.

A male Israeli soldier was also condemned after being filmed dancing suggestively around a blindfolded Palestinian woman in a video posted to YouTube in 2010.

That incident followed the discovery of photos earlier that year showing a female soldier posing in front of Palestinian prisoners.

The Israeli military banned soldiers from using social media sites while on base after the photographs came to light.

The ban was an effort to prevent future embarrassing posts on social media. It remains unclear whether the ban is in effect.

Early this year, another soldier was reprimanded for writing anti-Palestinian tweets and posting pictures to multiple social media services showing himself naked with a gun.

Most Jewish Israeli men and women are required to serve in the military, starting at age 18.
