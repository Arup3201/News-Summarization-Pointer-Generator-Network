The school's president, M. Lee Pelton, described her death only as 'unattended,' reports the Boston Globe.

'[She] was a bright light taken from this world far too soon,' Pelton wrote.

'Several of my Emerson colleagues and I visited with some of you who knew Jocelyn and I want you to know that we all share your deep sense of loss,' ran the email.

Pelton said that a memorial service was being planned.
