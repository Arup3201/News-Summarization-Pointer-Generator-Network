Rush Limbaugh has continued his attack on a student he branded a 'slut' for her views on contraception despite being ditched by advertisers and criticized by the President.

On his radio show yesterday, the 61-year-old defended his comments which have caused widespread outrage and went on to suggest that Ms Fluke 'had boyfriends lined up around the block. Or they would have been in my day'.

He said: 'She's having so much sex that she's going broke, she says... You're worried here that I'm just stepping in it deeper, yes you are but this is the truth.'

On Friday three advertisers revealed they will pull all adverts from the radio show after the host had made fun of Ms Fluke for saying religious institutions should cover birth control in health insurance - and said in a further show that she should have to make sex tapes if this ever happens.

Rant: Rush Limbaugh, 61, left called Sandra Fluke, right, a student at Catholic college Georgetown University, a 'slut' for saying religious institutions should cover birth control under health insurance

Now mattress retailers Sleep Train 
and Sleep Number, as well as mortgage lender QuickenLoans, have all 
bowed to pressure on Twitter and said they will no longer advertise on 
the show.

And Barack Obama 
has also weighed in to the row, describing the comment as 
'reprehensible' and calling student Sandra Fluke to discuss the 
controversy.

‘We don't condone negative comments 
directed toward any group,’ a Sleep Train spokesman tweeted. ‘Thanks to all of you 
for your concern and input.’

'Recent comments by Rush Limbaugh do not align with our values,' a Sleep Number spokesman said. 'So we made decision to immediately suspend all advertising on that program.'

A QuickenLoans spokesman said: 'Due to continued inflammatory comments - along with valuable feedback from clients & team members - QL has suspended ads on Rush Limbaugh.'

Meanwhile advertiser ProFlowers said it will 
're-evaluate’ its marketing plan and dating site eHarmony insisted it 
will look into ‘the matter of 'network buys’.

Mr Limbaugh said earlier this week that Ms Fluke, of Catholic college
Georgetown University in Washington D.C., was promiscuous for saying 
woman should get the pill for medical reasons.

And he went even further on his next show, saying: 'If we are going to pay for your contraceptives and thus pay for you to have sex... we want you to post the videos online so we can all watch.'

In addition, Barack Obama said he considered Mr Limbaugh's remarks 'reprehensible' and called Ms Fluke to express his disappointment that she was the subject of 'inappropriate personal attacks'.

'He said he hoped my parents were proud of me,' Ms Fluke said, adding that the President 'thanked me for speaking out and for expressing the concerns of so many women'.

Angry: Mattress retailer Sleep Train, based in Rocklin, California, has bowed to pressure on Twitter and said it will no longer advertise on the show

Also angry: Another mattress company in Sleep Number also announced through a spokesman that they were 'immediately suspending' all advertising on the Rush Limbaugh show

Out: Quicken Loans also decided to pull advertising from the show after the 'inflammatory comments'

'The fact that our political discourse has become debased in many ways 
is bad enough,' a White House spokesman said. 'It is worse when
it's directed at a private citizen simply expressing her 
views.'

More surprisingly, Mr Limbaugh has also faced criticism from the Republican presidential candidates, with Rick Santorum calling his comments 'absurd'.

When Mitt Romney was asked what he thought about the remarks, he replied: 'I'll just say this, which is, it's not the language I would have used.'

'If we are going to pay for your contraceptives and thus pay for you to have sex... we want you to post the videos online so we can all watch'

Rush Limbaugh

Mr Limbaugh
said on his original show regarding Ms Fluke's comments on birth 
control: ‘What does that make her? It makes her a slut, right? It makes 
her a prostitute. She wants
to be paid to have sex.

‘She's having so much sex she can't afford the contraception. She wants you and me and the taxpayers to pay her to have sex.’

Ms Fluke said on Friday that she has been left 'very upset' by the comments made by Mr Limbaugh.

'My reaction was the reaction
a lot of women have had historically when they’ve been called these 
types of names,' she told MSNBC. 'Initially to be stunned by it, and then to quickly feel outraged and very upset.'

Shock: Ms Fluke told MSNBC's Today show on Friday that she was 'stunned and outraged' by the comments

Ms Fluke was due to testify at a 
hearing on Capitol Hill last month about Barack Obama's mandate that 
health insurers provide contraception.

The Senate yesterday defeated a GOP effort to roll back President Barack Obama's policy on contraception insurance coverage.

It was the first vote on an issue that has raised controversy on religious and women's rights.

The close 51-48 vote killed an amendment to allow employers and insurers to opt out of portions of the President's health care law they found morally objectionable.

But committee chairman Darrell Issa of
California said she could not testify at the hearing as it was focused 
on threats to religious freedom.

Ms Fluke later put her testimony on 
YouTube and spoke about a friend who had to take birth control to treat a
disorder that caused ovarian cysts.

The friend subsequently lost her 
ovary. She also spoke of classmates who can’t afford contraception, 
which was what really riled Mr Limbaugh.

Ms Fluke claimed a female student spends $3,000 on protected sex during a three-year course at university, reported ABC News.

‘Three thousand dollars for birth 
control in three years? That’s $1,000 a year of sex - and, she wants us 
to pay for it,’ Mr Limbaugh said.

Spokesman: Ms Fluke was due to testify at a hearing on Capitol Hill last month about Barack Obama's mandate that health insurers provide contraception - but she wasn't allowed to do so

Another target: Mr Limbaugh also hit out at NASCAR driver Danica Patrick earlier this week on Monday for backing contraceptive insurance coverage

'She's having so much sex she can't 
afford her own birth control pills and she agrees that Obama should 
provide them, or the Pope.’

Should U.S. university students' health insurance cover birth control costs?

Female rights activists were left 
seething and two Democrats walked out of the Capitol Hill hearing last 
month after it was led by an all-male panel.

Ms Fluke did eventually speak about 
birth control at a Democratic hearing led by House Minority Leader Nancy
Pelosi last week, reported ABC News.

She is a third-year law student at Georgetown and ex-president of the Students for Reproductive Justice group at the university.

Mr Limbaugh also hit out at NASCAR driver Danica Patrick this week on Monday for backing contraceptive insurance coverage.

But he has faced attacks of his own to
deal with this week - after a survey of American viewers found he was 
their least-liked news personality.

Bomb squad officials investigated Rush Limbaugh's home in South Florida on Thursday after hearing reports of a possible threat.

The
apparent danger attracted extra attention on the day that the death of 
his fellow conservative commentator Andrew Breitbart was announced.

But
the item probed turned out to be an electronic plaque sent by a 
listener of the host's programme as a 'business opportunity' for him.

When
it was screened by an X-ray device, staffers saw what appeared to be 
wires and called police. The sender apologised to investigators.
