Never tell a sex joke to a Yorkshireman, and don't even dare use toilet humour in Scotland.

They're two crucial rules any stand-up must follow - if they believe a new study on the ever-elusive British sense of humour.

The report interviewed more than 2,000 comedy fans across Britain and claimed Londoners and the Welsh were the only people who liked toilet humour overall, while those in the South West were the biggest fans of sex jokes.

Rules of the game: A new survey claims there are big differences in sense of humour from region to region - while TV personalities like Geordie stand-up Sarah Millican (pictured) have boosted sales for female acts

The most prudish, it seemed, were those from Yorkshire - as the region emerged as the only one which reacted more negatively than positively to jokes about bedroom antics.

It scored minus 5 on a scale from 100 to minus 100, while the South West registered a score of 33. 

Some topics, including disability, race and death, were off-limits for almost everyone.

Others were fair game, including family, politics, the economy, education, gender and health.

Shappi Khorsandi said: 'It's great to see the surge in female comedians, stamping out the prejudice'

Most comedy fans enjoyed a gentle ribbing about where they live but those in the South West and North West were particular fans, with those in the East Midlands less impressed.

Toilet humour was deemed unacceptable everywhere except London and Wales - and Scotland thought scatological jokes were particularly unfunny.

Despite the regional differences the State of Play: Comedy report, commissioned by the gig sales website Ticketmaster, found there was no clear north-south divide to what Britons enjoy in comedy.

The wide-ranging survey also found big-name female comics such as Sarah Millican and Miranda Hart are putting women on the map - and into the box office.

Shows by female comedians now account for 14 per cent of all comedy tickets sold.

Despite comprising less than a seventh of all sales, the figure is a big improvement on 2009 when women were producing just 2 per cent of the industry's takings. 

Comedian Shappi Khorsandi said: 'It's great to see the surge in female comedians, stamping out the prejudice.

'We have still further to go though, I'd like to see more female comics enjoying the dominance that men do on the bigger stages.

'Perhaps we are not capturing the public's imagination in the same way, but it is all changing for the better and we are well on the way to enjoying equal success with our comedy brothers.'

The nation's favourite comedians were still dominated by men including Lee Evans, Michael McIntyre, Peter Kay, John Bishop and Jimmy Carr.

Miranda Hart was the only woman to make the top ten, squeezing into tenth place, but she came fifth in a list of comedians most likely to 'unite families' on the sofa.

The poll of more than 2,000 people revealed the extent to which TV can make or break a comedian's career, as 51 per cent of the respondents - who watched live shows regularly - said they would only pay to see someone who had already appeared on-screen.

Top pick: Michael McIntyre regularly crops up in the nation's list of favourite comics, and this was no exception

Britain's regions may have differences in what people find funny but comedians are drawn from every corner of the country. Pictured: Lancashire-born Peter Kay (left) and Liverpool's John Bishop (right) made the top five

And it claimed the art of heckling is disappearing, with only one in five thinking it was acceptable and just 3 per cent admitted to doing it regularly.

But as any comedy-lover worth their salt will insist, few gig-goers are perfect.

Even though more than four-fifths of people said whispering during a set was unacceptable, almost the same number admitted to doing it themselves.
