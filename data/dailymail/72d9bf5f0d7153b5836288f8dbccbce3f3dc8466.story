Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Leicester City have won none of their last six Premier League matches (W0 D1 L5), failing to score in five of those games.

Sunderland have won four and lost none of the last five league meetings with Leicester City but the two teams have not met since January 2007 in the Championship.

Sunderland have won just two of their last 12 Premier League matches (W2 D6 L4) both by a 3-1 scoreline.

Excluding blocked shots, Leicester City have fired in fewer shots (75) than any other team in the top flight this season.

Leicester and Sunderland haven't met since New Year's Day in 2007, when Tobias Hysen scored the opening goal with 11 minutes remaining in a 2-0 Championship win for the Black Cats at the King Power Stadium

Wes Morgan has blocked more opposition shots than any other player in the Premier League this season (17).

Connor Wickham has conceded more fouls than any other player in the top flight this season (27).

Vito Mannone has made more errors leading directly to goals than any other Premier League player this season (3).

Sunderland’s 3-1 win at Selhurst Park last time on the road ended a run of three away league games without scoring for the Black Cats.

Sunderland have won on their last two visits to the King Power Stadium, without conceding a goal.

However, the Black Cats have never won away at Leicester in the Premier League losing three and drawing one of their four visits.
