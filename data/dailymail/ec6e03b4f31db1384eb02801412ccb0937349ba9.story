The three boys were charged with aggravated criminal sexual assault and brought before Cook County Court on Friday

Three teenage boys are accused of raping a 12-year-old girl at gunpoint and then posting a video of the attack on Facebook.

Kenneth Brown, 15, Justin Applewhite and Scandale Fritz, both 16, appeared at court on Friday charged with aggravated criminal sexual assault.

They are accused of luring the young girl to Fritz's home in Englewood, Chicago, before sexually assaulting her.

The girl visited the home on West 60th Place on December 15, last year.

Prosecutors said she saw  Brown hold a gun and was then told by Fritz to go to the basement.

The girl said she was raped by Fritz and then ordered to have sex with Brown and Applewhite.

Prosecutors said the girl refused but was raped by Brown and Applewhite and ordered to perform sex acts on them.

She feared being shot if she tried to escape, local media reported.

A day after the alleged attack, the child told someone and was taken to hospital and police were contacted. 

A video of the alleged attack was uploaded to Brown's Facebook page two days later, according to the Chicago Tribune.

It was then shared and appeared on Applewhite and Fritz's pages.

Court prosecutors said the boys are visible in the video and can be heard shouting gang slogans.

Fritz later admitted making a tape, according to court records.

The three teenagers will be tried as adults.

They were brought before Criminal Court Judge James Brown on Friday where bail was set at $900,000 each. 

They are due back in court on June 6.

According to local news website DNAinfo Fritz plays basketball at Englewood High School and Brown plays football at Hubbard High School.

A video of the alleged attack was uploaded to Facebook and was shared on the suspect's pages (file picture)
