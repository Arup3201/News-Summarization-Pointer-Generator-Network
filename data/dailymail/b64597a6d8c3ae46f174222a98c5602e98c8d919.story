In tears and clutching a Valentine’s Day card for her boyfriend, Lizzy Yarnold yesterday received  Britain’s first gold medal at the Winter Olympics.

The former grammar school pupil had dominated the skeleton competition in Sochi which saw her hurtle down an ice track at 80mph on a ‘tray’  nicknamed Mervyn.

It was a sweet victory for the 25-year-old who had dedicated herself to winning the gold medal after being talent spotted as a future Olympic hero as a teenager.

With a time of 58.06, she beat American Noelle Pikus-Pace by just under a second

Following her run Yarnold said the win was going to take a while to sink in

After the last of her four runs yesterday she admitted she had been so confident of winning that she had even learned how to say ‘I’m champion’ in Russian.

She had been cheered on at the track by the ‘Yarnie Army’ – her former PE teacher mother Judith, businessman dad Clive, and her sisters, Katie and Charlotte.

And she was in tears on the podium as she held a Valentine’s Day card for her boyfriend James Roche, who works with the technical team for British Bobsleigh.

Miss Yarnold, from Sevenoaks in Kent, said: ‘As an athlete you give up so much, but on a day like today, with a victory like today it’s so worth it.

‘I wanted to do myself justice and I can’t believe I won the race. It’s lovely that it’s Valentine’s Day today as well, there’s lots of romance in the air.

‘My mum and dad coming to watch me, my sisters, my best friends, everyone’s here that I can share it with; I couldn’t do it without them.’

Miss Yarnold had been determined to be a successful sportswoman from the age of seven when she would beat her farmer father Clive in races on the ski slope.

After prep school she had chosen to go to Maidstone Grammar School rather than accept an independent school scholarship so she could finish at 3.30pm to train as a county standard runner and swimmer.

She had hoped to be selected for the modern pentathalon but after attending a Girls4Gold programme aimed at identifying future Olympic athletes she was told she was suited to the skeleton.

After winning yesterday Miss Yarnold urged others to follow her example. She said: ‘Have a go, follow your dreams. Never limit yourself, never limit yourself to what you can achieve.’

Mr Yarnold said he had taught Lizzy to ski at the age of seven and soon she was beating him in races.

Support: Yarnold's family were there to see her win, including sister Katie, father Clive and mother Judith

He said: ‘She would get to the bottom and tell me to hurry up.

‘She was always a hard working, determined and dedicated girl, so strong mentally.’

To win gold Miss Yarnold had to negotiate a 1,500 metre course with 18 corners, a vertical drop of nearly 132m and an average gradient of 9.3 degrees.

Her sled is nicknamed ‘Mervyn’ after Mervyn Sugden whom she met when she took a summer job at Hardy Underwriting – an insurance syndicate of Lloyd’s of London – to fund her training.

Yarnold said the final run was a bit shaky, but that she had been relaxed and enjoyed it

Making it look easy: With a commanding overnight lead, it would have taken a major error today to rob Britain of the title

Mr Sugden, a retired underwriter, was so impressed with her determination he brokered a deal with Lloyd & Partners to finance the British skeleton team to the tune of £100,000. Miss Yarnold, who relaxes by knitting and listening to the Archers, had been sent his good luck message before she competed.

Before travelling to Sochi she had revealed the lengths she had gone to in order to achieve her Olympic dream. She had said: ‘Champions don’t happen by accident.

‘My whole life I have dreamt about becoming a British Olympian and for the last five years since I took up skeleton, Sochi 2014 has been my primary focus.

‘It helps if you are a little bit mad.  You have to totally embrace what you are doing and accept your fate.’

Miss Yarnold is such an accomplished all-round sportswoman that she also represented Britain last year in team bobsleigh, finishing seventh at the 2013 World Championships in Switzerland.

On
 Thursday, in warm conditions which saw a group of Canadians walk around
 bare-chested, Yarnold was the coolest competitor about. She observed 
her usual patterns of listening to music and napping between runs.

Her first 80mph descent immediately put her in charge. Her second run kept her there. ‘I was relaxed as soon as I got to the track,’ said the 25-year-old.

‘As soon as I stepped on to the start
 line my coach really settled me. Once I started, everything felt so 
natural and I loved it.

‘I 
don’t feel the pressure, I’ve not been thinking about other people’s 
expectations because I’ve got such high expectations of myself anyway.

On Sunday Jenny Jones won Britain's first medal of the Games, with a bronze in the snowboard slopestyle

With Yarnold's gold added to Jones' bronze, Team GB is now just one medal off of its three medal target

‘I’ve
 tried lots of different things in training and brought that through 
into competition. I didn’t get curve 14 on the first run right and it’s 
an uphill section so that bled my time. But the first and second runs 
are the fastest I’ve ever gone. It’s not a bad day.’

Pikus-Pace, highly fancied coming into the Olympics but suffering a bad back, said: ‘It is hers to lose, I guess.’ 

Not everyone was quite as gung-ho as that. Nigel Laughton, GB team leader, called the margin a ‘good lead but not insurmountable’.

The atmospherics will be different on Friday — Riviera conditions giving way to black skies and floodlights and adding a further frisson of excitement to the drama unfolding on the icy, twisting descent. None will feel the tension more than the  travelling ‘Yarny Army’, comprising Yarnold’s friends and family.

Yarnold was the day’s top British performer, eclipsing Shelley Rudman, the skeleton world champion, who struggled with the fast technical course and ended the day in 11th place.

Creditable: James Woods finished in a respectable fifth place in the Skiing slopestyle final on Thurday

Another letdown for those of us watching was James Woods’ marginal failure to win a medal in the ski slopestyle. He seemed thrilled not only to have finished fifth, despite so painful a hip injury that it crossed his mind he might need to withdraw, but simply to be part of the jamboree.

No British male skier has ever been placed as high as Woods at an  Olympic Games.

Congratulations to all the British slopestylists. Five out of six have made it into the top 10 here. Jenny Jones, has won the country’s only medal of these Games, a bronze. 

Now over to Yarnold to add the bullion. ‘It’s as good as it gets,’ she said. Not quite. God willing, Russian skulduggery notwithstanding, that comes on Thursday night.
