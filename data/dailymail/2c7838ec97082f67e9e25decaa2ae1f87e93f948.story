A violent boyfriend high on a cocktail of alcohol, cocaine and cannabis, stabbed his mistress to death after she found his £1,500  gambling winnings and threatened to spend it on their love child.

Andre Bright, 30, stabbed Victoria Adams, 22, in the chest and in the stomach in Oldham, Greater Manchester, on December 8 last year, leaving her with a wound so deep it reached her kidney.

As police arrived  to arrest Bright they found him watching Miss Adams bleed to death on her hallway carpet while she begged for her baby daughter, who was asleep upstairs.

When he refused to go with police an officer shot him with a 50,000 volt Taser. He didn't move, and after the officer threatened to shoot him again he sneered: 'I enjoyed that. You need more volts.'

Andre Bright, 30, sentenced to 17 years in jail for the murder of Victoria Adams, 22. When police went to arrest Bright in Oldham, Greater Manchester, last year they found him watching as Miss Adams bled to death

Bright was convicted at 14 after shooting him in the face with a BB gun. He also stabbed a man in a bar fight, beat a pregnant ex-girlfriend, and attacked a bouncer with an Afro pick after trying to urinate on him

Today Bright was jailed for 17 years after being found guilty of murder and assault at Manchester Crown Court.

He shrugged as the unanimous verdict was read out, while friends and relatives of the victim wept, screamed and cheered in the public gallery.

Bright had a long history of violence stretching back to when he was just 14. He was arrested after he shot a man in the face with a BB gun, causing him to loose the sight in one of his eyes.

He was also convicted of stabbing two men in a bar fight, leaving one with a perforated bowel, and of beating up a previous girlfriend while she was pregnant when she accused him of cheating.

Police arrested him three months before the attack outside a nightclub with scissors in his pocket. 

Just hours before killing Miss Adams he was caught on CCTV trying to urinate on a bouncer, and when the man pushed him away he stabbed him repeatedly in the face with an Afro pick.

Bright often bragged to friends that, on the estate where he lived, it was cool to carry a knife. 

Bright married in 2009 and had three children with his wife, but kept a string of secret girlfriends in tow, and had at least one other child with Miss Adams.

She was a travel and tourism graduate who first met Bright when she was just 16, and the pair began a stormy six-year on-off relationship.

The court heard that Bright never went out with Miss Adams as a couple, and instead used her flat as a place to crash whenever he was drunk or high on drugs.

Mr Mark Kellet, prosecuting, said that Miss Adams found out she was pregnant with his child after taking a pregnancy test in January 2013, and sent him a text with the good news.

Miss Adams met Bright when she was 16, beginning an abusive six-year relationship. Manchester Crown Court heard they never went anywhere as a couple, and Bright used her house to crash in while drunk or high

Bright married in 2009, and has three children with his wife, but in kept seeing Miss Adams, who fell pregnant in 2013. After telling him about the baby, Bright told her to delete his number and never call him again

But Bright was furious, telling her to delete his number and to never call him again.

Three days before she was killed, on December 5, Miss Adams had a fight with Bright after she went out with friends for the first time since having her baby in August.

Bright stormed to her house, and began calling his other girlfriends in front of her. When she told him to stop he spat on her, told her he would sleep with her friends, then threw a bottle at her.

Mr Kellet said: 'She had run from the house fearing that Andre Bright would kill her.' She later turned up at a friend’s house crying, wearing a dressing gown and no shoes. 

She told Bright’s sister Michelle Dunkley that 'Andre’s conduct had become frightening' and when he turned up at the flat again she sent to a text message to Ms Dunkley saying: 'I don’t wanna stay here but he’s in such a bad way.'

On the night of the murder Bright and a friend visited another house in the area, buying three bottles of wine along the way, before he returned to Miss Adams flat in a taxi at around 9.35am.

She found a wad of cash in his pocket, and threatened to keep it 'given what little he had done for their daughter.'

Just half an hour later Bright phoned police, saying: 'Can I have an ambulance please? Someone is dying in front of me. Someone has stabbed her, I don’t know what’s happened. She’s dying.'

Pressed for more information on how the stabbing had happened, Bright became angry. When the call handler asked him for a third time he shouted 'shut up' and slammed the phone down. 

On the night of the murder Bright was four times over the drink-drive limit, and had taken cocaine and cannabis. During a row over his gambling winnings, he stabbed Miss Adams in the chest and stomach

Three days before the attack Miss Adams went out with friends for the first time since having the baby. Bright came to her house, called his other girlfriends in front of her, spat on her, and threw a bottle at her 

When officers arrived they found Bright, who was three times over the drink drive limit, and high on cocaine and cannabis, standing with a ‘fixed, almost vacant gaze’, with his hands in his pockets.

Only a short distance away, Miss Adams lay bleeding to dead in the doorway of her flat.

Paramedics treating Miss Adams say they tried to ask her about what had happened, but every time she spoke it was to ask where her baby was.

Fearing Bright was still holding the knife, an officer hit him with a Taser. He was warned that if he moved he would be hit again, and he said: 'I enjoyed that. You need more volts in your taser.'

Mr Kellet said: 'A female officer states that as the defendant was being escorted out of the premises, he looked directly at her and smiled.

'The Crown say the defendant was doing as he did, seeking to intimidate police officers.'

Miss Adams was taken to Manchester Royal Infirmary, where doctors discovered a three inch deep stab wound to her chest, and a five inch wound to her abdomen which had penetrated her kidney.

She bled to death several hours later, despite the efforts of surgeons to save her.

Bright attempted to deny the crimes, saying Miss Adams had run into him while he was holding a knife, and that he had been in the middle of a psychotic episode and unable to control himself.

Bright shrugged as he was sentenced today, while family and friends of Miss Adams cried, screamed and cheered in the public gallery

However, a jury swept his claims aside to deliver a unanimous guilty verdict today.

Sentencing Bright, Mrs Justice Susan Carr said: 'You have a history of violent offending and show no remorse whatsoever for the victim’s family. 

'You had a wife and three children and other girlfriends from time to time and it is clear you were using Victoria for sex.

'Whether your motive was the fact she had found and spent some of your money or you felt trapped in some way by the arrival of your child doesn’t matter. 

'You have a propensity for violence and this was sheer violence.

“I’m quite satisfied you intended to kill Victoria when you stabbed her. Victoria’s family and friends have attended every day of this trial. 

'Mr Adams described in graphic terms the ordeal of the trial which has intensified their despair and anguish. He speaks with pride of a wonderful daughter who did well at school, went to college, was a hard-worker with a vibrant social life and many friends.

'She had everything to look forward to. He describes her as beautiful, intelligent, funny, happy and wonderful. So many people loved her and have had their hearts broken.

“The pain he and his wife and feel is difficult to describe. He describes a total debilitating grief, an incredible sense of loss is with them all of the time and it has affected the lives of so many others. 

'The pain her daughter will suffer, the guilt and sadness as she grows up. Her daughter has to live her life without her amazing mother.'

Detective Chief Inspector Howard Millington, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'Bright's relationship with Victoria had been described as volatile and his family members had noticed he had recently been drinking heavily and taking drugs.

'For reasons only known to Bright himself, he decided he would get a taxi to Miss Adam's house and stab her.

'Victoria had a young daughter and, tragically, she will grow up never really knowing who she was. 

'Not only has Bright robbed her of her mum, he has also taken away a beloved daughter of Victoria's parents. 

'They have been left truly devastated by what happened that morning and will never truly recover.'
