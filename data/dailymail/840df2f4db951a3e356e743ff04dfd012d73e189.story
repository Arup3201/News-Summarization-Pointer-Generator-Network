Under fire: Dr Sunil Kakar, 46, has been temporarily barred from practicing psychology for allowing a prostitute to flee with his laptop containing information on hundreds of patients

A Washington state psychologist has been suspended from practice for allowing a prostitute to take off with his laptop containing sensitive information on his 652 clients.

Dr Sunil Kakar, 46, of Gig Harbor, initially told police that his portable computer was stolen from his unlocked car February 4, but he later admitted that a call girl swiped it while he went to take cash out of an ATM.

The psychologist allegedly failed to report the theft for four days in violation of his contract with the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services and downpayed the number of patients who could be affected. 

Police investigators were eventually able to locate the stolen device, The Seattle Times reported.

In March, Kakar sent a letter to his clients apologizing for his conduct.

'I am extremely sorry for this situation and understand it may cause concern, embarrassment and inconvenience,' he wrote. 'I try very hard to earn your trust, and that includes protecting sensitive information about you. I take client confidentiality very seriously.'

The DSHS said in a press release Monday that Kakar cannot resume his practice until the charges against him are resolved.

The doctor will have an opportunity to present his side of the story during a hearing later this month. He could face a longer license suspension or revocation, as well as a fine of up to $5,000 for each violation.

Odd behavior: Kakar got in trouble in 2011 after allegedly stealing food from an inmate at a prison where he worked as a psychologist

The allegations against Kakar stem from an incident that took place February 4 when the 46-year-old newly single doctor left his personal laptop with a hooker as collateral while he went to withdraw money from an ATM.

By the time Kakar returned to his car, both the woman and his laptop were gone.

According to the Department of Health, Kakar did not contact the agency about his missing laptop holding his patients’ unprotected health information until February 7.

The 46-year-old psychologist waited another week before filing a report with police, who were able to track down the stolen laptop to a pawn shop that same day.

This is not the first time that Mr Kakar has come under scrutiny over allegations of unprofessional conduct.

According to the DSHS, Kakar was involved in a bizarre incident in April 2011 while working as a mental health provider for the Department of Corrections, The News Tribune reported.

The doctor allegedly refused to leave an area where an inmate was set to be strip-searched and then stole food from a prisoner. He also allegedly threatened to beat up the boyfriend of another inmate.

Later than month, Kakar was admitted into a mental health clinic and was issued a recommendation for a chemical dependency evaluation.

Newly single: Dr Kakar, who specializes in depression and traumatic events, split from his wife (left) last year after 12 years of marriage

In July of that year, the psychologist was arrested for DUI and marijuana possession, but pleaded guilty to a downgraded charge of negligent driving.

Kakar, a graduate of Loma Linda University in California, was licensed as a psychologist in 2004, specializing in depression, anxiety and traumatic life events like death and divorce.

According to his Facebook page, Kakar split from his wife last year after 12 years of marriage, and the couple have a teenage daughter.
