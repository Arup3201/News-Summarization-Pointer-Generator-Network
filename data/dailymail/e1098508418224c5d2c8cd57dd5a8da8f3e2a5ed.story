A nine-year-old girl woke up to find both her parents dead after accidentally overdosing on a party drug called Dr Death.

The child found the body of her mother, Suzanne Van Hagen, 34, and stepfather John Worton, 37, in separate rooms at home in Frankley, Worcestershire.

She called 999 and told an operator 'blood was coming out of her dad's mouth'.

Shock: Suzanne Van Hagen, 34, and John Worton, 37, were found dead at home by their nine-year-old daughter after accidentally taking an overdose of the Class A party drug called Dr Death or Pink Ecstasy

An inquest heard the child woke up shortly after 9am before seeing her stepfather's body lifeless in the living room.  

Post mortem results revealed fitness instructor Mr Worton had taken a lethal dose of paramethoxyamphetamine (PMA), also known as Dr Death or Pink Ecstasy.

He had also taken recreational stimulant BZP and was drinking alcohol in the hours leading up to his death on February 8 last year, a pathologist told the court.

An inquest into Ms Van Hagen's death will take place at a later date, but a previous post mortem examination showed she had also died from an accidental overdose of the Class A drug.

Ambulance technician Adrian McCorkell said he was sent to the property at 9.53am after the child's distraught 999 call. 

Tragic: The child found her stepfather John Worton (pictured with an unidentified child) in the living room

Crime scene: Police and paramedics were called to the house in Frankley, Worcestershire, at 9.53am

Investigation: The child was put in the care of her grandparents as a post mortem examination was carried out

PMA, nicknamed Dr Death for its lethal side-effects, has claimed the lives of ten young people within a 60-mile radius of Manchester since January.

The pills, which are available for as little as £3 each, are sometimes pink and shaped like Love Hearts sweets, or stamped with an ‘M’.

The amphetamine is also known as pink ecstasy, but it contains a different active ingredient which makes it as much as five times stronger.

PMA also takes longer to have an effect than ecstasy which means some users take more and unwittingly give themselves fatal overdoses.

The youngest victim was 16-year-old Ellie Jones, who died after suffering breathing difficulties at a friend’s house in Warrington.

PMA has also been linked to the deaths of eight revellers in Canada and there have been other deaths in Norway and Denmark.

He said: 'I was greeted by a young girl. 

'She stated that she was upset, she stated that her dad would be very upset if she let me in. 

'I pushed the door open and passed her and since I got into the property, I asked her to show me where her mother was and she pointed into the direction of the doorway.'

Mr McCorkell said he saw Ms Van Hagen in the bedroom. 

He was then shown to the living room where he found stepfather Mr Worton's body, which had been had been covered by a sheet. 

He said: 'I tried to get the girl to sit outside. 

'She was reluctant to leave the property.'

Police officers arrived and took care of the youngster before declaring the one-bedroomed maisonette a major crime scene.

Mr Worton was pronounced dead at 10.10am by Mr McCorkell.

Pathologist Alexander Kolar said: 'There was also evidence of alcohol and drugs of a therapeutic level.'

Coroner Louise Hunt recorded Mr Worton's cause of death as 'mixed drug toxicity', principally PMA and Benzylpiperazine.

Nearly 20 people have died after taking PMA, which can cost as little as £3 per pill.

They include friends Chris Goodwin, 30, and Emma Johnson, 21, from Bolton, who took up to five times the lethal dose of the amphetamine at a party in 2012.

Ms Van Hagen, who is thought to have worked as a nurse, was a former pupil at a top Catholic girls' school, St Paul's, in Birmingham.
