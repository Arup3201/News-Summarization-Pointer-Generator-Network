A U.S. Marine returning from a tour of duty in Iraq has been ordered to remove an American flag he's hoisted outside his Florida home.

Gregory Schaffer says an anonymous complaint from a neighbor over the banner's pole has led to a citation from his town of Hypoluxo accusing it of being a code violation.

'It's sad. It's sad that we have to go through that just to fly a flag,' Mr Scahaffer told WPTV.

Violation: Marine Gregory Schaffer has been told he must take his American flag down from his front yard in Hypoluxo, Florida with the pole found in code violation

Policy: Mr Schaffer, who recently returned home from a tour of duty in Iraq, says his town's building department insist that he have a building permit for the pole

Mr Schaffer raised the flag to share a symbol of national pride in his town but the building department says that it must side with the neighbor.

'He can fly his flag, the issue is that he has to get a building permit,' Tim Large, who heads Hypoluxo's building department told WPTV.

The flag pole he says is considered a structure, one the Marine doesn't have a permit for.

'I would love to see the guy be able to do this. To me it's not personal, it's strictly my job,' said Mr Large.

But getting a permit is easier said than done, according to Mr Schaffer.

Cited: Days after Mr Schaffe raised the flag in his front yard, seen, he received the citation from an anonymous neighbor

Because he's only renting the property he says he'll have to go through a third party contractor to submit an application.

He says that could cost him nearly $1,000.

'It's disgusting that anybody should have to go through that. I fought for the flag, now I'm paying for the flag,' said Mr Schaffer.

As for the neighbor who reported him, Mr Schaffer says he has mixed feelings on that matter.

Outrageous: Mr Schaffer shows off the notice he received, informing him of his need of a permit which he says could cost him around $1,000

Having served in the Marines he knows well the rights of freedoms given to all Americans, ones he personally fought to protect.

'I respect their right to be able to file a complaint and handle things the way they did. Do I respect what they did? No. I respect their ability to do so,' he said.

The town says they're working with Mr Schaffer to make sure he has every chance to fly his flag.
