The attention at Gleneagles this weekend may be focused on whether Paul McGinley's team can seal a hattrick of Ryder Cup victories, but on Thursday there was a different contest taking place between Europe and the USA. 

Their boyfriends and partners were busy preparing for this weekend's highly-anticipated battle  - but the so-called GWAGs have wasted no time getting the competition started early.

The hot contest between team Europe and team USA was well and truly underway today as the Golfing Wives and Girlfriends paraded along the sporting catwalk into the opening ceremony of this year's Ryder Cup. 

Competition: The U.S and European Golfing Wives and Girlfriends arrived at Gleneagles golf course in style for the opening ceremony of the 2014 Ryder Cup

Wearing matching outfits to represent their respective sides, the stylish women demonstrated their fashion credentials as they descended on the Gleneagles golf course in Perthshire earlier today.

Led by Hilary Watson - wife of U.S 
Captain Tom Watson - the women from Team USA wore matching 
camel-coloured jacks, black ankle boots, belted black dresses and 
striped scarves to pledge their allegiance to their men.

Meanwhile,
 the opposing team went for a slightly more understated look, donning a 
belted navy blue trench coat, stiletto black boots and black jeans for 
the event. 

But unlike those who coined the initial WAG term, it seems the GWAGs are insistent on making the Ryder Cup a classy affair.

While
 the like of Coleen Rooney and Cheryl Cole were somewhat mocked for 
their look during the 2006 World Cup, these women are already scoring 
points in the style stakes. 

They
 also seem to be getting along famously and were seen laughing and 
joking with one another as they watched on at the opening ceremony. Having
 very much become an integral part of the Ryder Cup weekend, the wives 
and girlfriends will no doubt be as much in the spotlight as their 
partners take to the Scottish fairways.

Elsewhere, the event was altogether a cheery affair. From
 tartan kilts, to star-spangled tracksuits, and suits emblazoned with 
the German flag, golf fans from across Europe and America have flooded 
to Gleneagles today for the opening ceremony of the 2014 Ryder Cup.

The
 supporters were joined by the European team, decked out in snappy 
tartan suits, the Americans dressed in an imposing black pattern, and 
drummers kitted out in traditional Scottish formal wear, although the 
wind got the better of one musician's hat.

The
 pairings for the opening fourballs were announced during the opening 
ceremony, with Rory McIlroy and Sergio Garcia set to face Keegan 
Bradley and Phil Mickelson during the hotly-anticipated opening fourballs on Friday.

McIlroy took to Twitter earlier today and posted a selfie of the European team, along with the messsage: 'Pre opening ceremony selfie!!'

2011.
