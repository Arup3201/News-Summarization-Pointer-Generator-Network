Emotional pooch Scipio isn't pleased that someone else is having Happy Birthday sung for them or he simply doesn't like his owner's singing.

Either way, it makes for adorable footage of the mid-sized brown pooch posted online by user 'JustinEb'.

As the man, not seen in the video and unnamed, begins a slow rendition of Happy Birthday, Scipio reacts immediately ... and while it's up for interpretation he's not especially positive about it.  

At the opening strains of the dirge-like version of the celebratory song the dog seems to whimper and put his nose to the carpet.

However, when the man filming the exchange stops singing, Scipio appears to calm down.

Scipio reacts immediately as his owner sings Happy Birthday, and it doesn't seem to be a positive reaction

The animated brown pooch appears to cry when the unseen man sings his slow version of the tune 

But as the song begins again the canine's agitation returns until he reaches the point where laying down and looking away until it's over is his preferred option.

At the end, as the owner slowly and in a low tone says, 'I love you,' Scipio lets out a howl and decides it's his turn to sing.
