Sentenced: Sandy Nguyen, 29, pleaded guilty to charitable fraud and child abuse after the scam

A mother who lied about her son having cancer to more than $25,000 in charitable contributions will serve five years of probation and spend 90 nights in jail on work release.

Sandy Nguyen, from Aurora, Colorado, was sentenced on Tuesday after pleading guilty to one count each of charitable fraud and child abuse,KUSA reported.

Police say she convinced her six-year-old son, family and others in the community that the boy had bone cancer and had been receiving treatment since about September 2012.

At the time of her arrest in March, she was pregnant and her child was taken away from her in light of the criminal case - although it is not yet known if she will get her children back.

She started falsely telling members of her community that the boy had been diagnosed the previous April with 'an aggressive, rare, stage 3 childhood bone cancer and Acute Myelogenous Leukemia'. 

There were even times the boy and everyone else believed he'd gone into remission and once when Nguyen, 29, allegedly said the 'he probably only had 8 more months with them'.

The community also held a 5K charity walk for the boy. The event's page notes that he was 'fighting cancer for the 3rd time'.

Photos from Nguyen's Facebook page also reportedly showed a boy both with hair and a bald head, as if he had endured chemotherapy. The page has since been removed.

Scam: She raised thousands of dollars and used some of the money to take her family to Disneyland

Various community and school fundraisers raised some $25,000 for the family, and police say Nguyen used some of the money to pay for a family trip to Disneyland. 

But the scheme began to unravel after a doctor at Children's Hospital of Denver's oncology unit overheard her talking about her son but did not recognize his name. 

After checking records at the hospital, investigators found out the youngster hadn't been treated for cancer at the hospital, but that he had seen doctors for less serious ailments.

Arapahoe County Sheriff's investigators executed a search warrant at Nguyen's home, recovering about $23,000 in cash. 

Her defense lawyer said that all of the money was recovered and that none of it had been raised for her personal gain. 

At her sentencing hearing, Nguyen's defense team said the scam began after the young boy was diagnosed with a skin condition and that she had never intended to deceive people, CBS reported.   

Tricked: She claimed she never intended to deceive people but didn't discourage them from thinking that her son had cancer either, she said. She gave birth after her arrest and is now fighting to get her kids back

'We don't have any reason to believe that anyone other than her knew the truth,' Arapahoe County Sheriff's Captain Larry Etheridge told KMGH following her arrest earlier this year. 'The little boy believed he had cancer. The rest of the family believed he had cancer.'

The child's principal, Darla Thompson, informed parents of the situation in a letter after the allegations emerged, writing: 'We are deeply troubled by these allegations and saddened to learn that an adult may have taken advantage of an innocent child and our school community.

'It is important for our community to continue to show support and compassion for this child, who is also a victim in this case. The child was wrongfully led to believe that he was ill, and he was not responsible for the parent’s alleged actions.'

Her sentence means she can go to work during the day but must return to jail as soon as her shift is finished. She also has two other children, aged one and eight.
