Craig Gordon insists it’s wrong to bill Sunday’s Old Firm game as the most mismatched of all time - and claims Celtic’s chances of reaching the League Cup Final are no more than 50/50.

The Scottish champions moved three points clear of Aberdeen at the top of the Premiership with a 1-0 victory over Ross County in Dingwall on Saturday, while Rangers, whose caretaker boss Kenny McDowall last week handed in his notice, remain mired in a boardroom crisis and trail Championship leaders Hearts by 13 points.

Parkhead striker Anthony Stokes has admitted some fans won’t be satisfied unless Ronny Deila’s men rack up four or five goals against their beleaguered rivals at Hampden.

But Celtic No 1 Gordon says talk of running up a cricket score is dangerous and misguided.

He said: ‘We got by against Ross County with just one goal and that shows you can’t go into any game thinking about how many goals you’re going to score.

‘Is it a 50-50 game? They probably always are 50/50 games, regardless of who’s playing for the two sides.

‘Rangers still have enough quality in their team to win a game so we’ll be looking at ourselves and our preparation.

‘The form book goes out the window in Celtic-Rangers matches. There are two sides with 11 men desperate to win the game. And when you have that, anything can happen.

‘You go out in any match intending to win your own individual battles and try to get a victory – whatever the scoreline.’

Former Sunderland and Hearts star Gordon knows the quality of the Rangers squad having spent time training at Murray Park during his long recovery from injury. The 32-year-old was involved in a public spat last November when ex-Rangers boss Ally McCoist claimed he had tried to sign him – a claim the keeper rejected.

He also rejects the notion Celtic will be under enormous pressure on Sunday, given they are clear favourites.

‘I don’t feel there is added pressure on us. It’s not just experience Rangers have, but good, quality players, too. So we’ll have to be wary of that, as well as causing our own problems for them.

‘It’s a semi-final and it’s a massive match - but it would be massive regardless.’

Meanwhile, Celtic boss Deila remained coy when asked about a link with Manchester United and Scotland midfielder Darren Fletcher on Saturday.

He said: ‘There’s nothing new in that matter. He has several [interested clubs] and it is best for me to wait to next Monday to see where we are.’

Celtic also been linked with a move for midfielder Kim Bo-Kyung. They missed out on the South Korea international when Malky Mackay brought him to Cardiff for £5million in 2012 but he has just been released by the Welsh side.
