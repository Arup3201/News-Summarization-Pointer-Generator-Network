A teacher has pleaded not guilty to abducting a teenage girl, as he appeared in court via prison videolink.

Jeremy Forrest, 30, was arrested in Bordeaux in France on September 28 last year following the issuing of a European arrest warrant.

Following extradition to Britain, Forrest - a teacher at Bishop Bell C of E School in Eastbourne, East Sussex - was charged by Sussex Police on October 10 with abducting a child, who cannot be identified for legal reasons.

Today, at a plea and case management hearing at Lewes Crown Court in front of judge Mr Justice Singh, Forrest denied child abduction as he appeared via videolink from HMP Lewes.

Prosecutor Richard Barton said a two-week trial will be heard at the same court from June 10 in front of Judge Richard Brown. A pre-trial review will be heard on May 17.

No bail application was made and Forrest, of Chislehurst Road, Petts Wood, south-east London, was remanded in custody.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
