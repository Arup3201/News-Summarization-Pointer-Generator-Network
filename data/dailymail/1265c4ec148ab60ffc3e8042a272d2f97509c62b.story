Thousands of health workers began knocking on doors across Sierra Leone on Friday in search of hidden Ebola cases as the entire West African nation was locked down in their homes in an unprecedented effort to combat the deadly disease.

Wooden tables lay empty at the capital's usually vibrant food markets. Police stood guard at roadblocks in this nation of six million people. This crumbling seaside capital, its streets normally crowded with bumper-to-bumper traffic, seemed like a ghost town.

Health workers planned to give each household a bar of soap during neighborhood canvassing. Once a house is visited it is to be marked with a sticker. President Ernest Bai Koroma urged Sierra Leoneans to cooperate.

'The survival and dignity of each and every Sierra Leonean is at stake,' he said Thursday night in an address to the nation.

The lockdown comes as six people were arrested in neighbouring Guinea for the deaths of eight people who were on an Ebola awareness campaign.

Police are enforcing a strict lock-down in Freetown Sierra Leone as the government tries desperately to stop the spread of the killer virus during the deadly outbreak

President Ernest Bai Koroma announced the three-day lock down on movement, asking his people to respect the instruction stop the spread of the disease 

Across the city, only a handful of people tried to pass through the roadblocks as teams of medics attempt to locate hidden cases of the disease 

At least 562 people are believed to have died from Ebola since the virus came to Sierra Leone from neighbouring Guinea. It is believed that more than 2,600 people have died across west Africa since the current outbreak started. 

Authorities hope to find and isolate Ebola patients who have resisted going to health centers, often seen only as places to die. Some international health experts have warned there might not be enough beds at treatment centers for new patients found during the three-day lockdown which ends Sunday.

UNICEF said the measure provides an opportunity to tell people how to protect themselves.

'If people don't have access to the right information, we need to bring life-saving messages to them, where they live, at their doorsteps,' said Roeland Monasch, UNICEF Representative in Sierra Leone. In a statement, the U.N. children's fund said the operation needs to be carried out 'in a sensitive and respectful manner.'

Most seemed to be taking the order seriously, and there were no immediate reports of resistance to the lockdown.

'It will protect our country from this dangerous virus,' said Ishmail Bangura, a Freetown resident. 'Many of our people have died - nurses and doctors too - so if they ask us to stay home for three days, for me it not bad.'

The woman's clothes are covered in blood, which is highly infectious and is one of the reasons the government wants to identify all existing cases to control the spread

However during this first-ever Ebola outbreak in West Africa, some people have previously lashed out at health workers, accusing them of bringing the dreaded disease. Others don't believe it exists. Many villagers in rural Guinea have reacted with fear and panic when outsiders conducted awareness campaigns, and this week such an encounter resulted in deaths.

A team of eight who were on a campaign to raise awareness for Ebola have been killed in the country. The government announced that six people have been arrested. The team, accompanied by journalists, had gone to the village of Womey on Tuesday. Another team dispatched to look for nine missing members discovered eight bodies, including those of three local journalists, a hospital administrator and several health officials, the government said.

Only one of the missing - the son of a Womey deputy administrative official - was found alive and hiding in the area, the government statement said.

More than 2,600 people have died across West Africa, with more than half the fatalities recorded in Liberia.

Earlier this week, President Barack Obama pledged 3,000 troops and the first increased American military aid arrived in Liberia on Thursday, according to the U.S. Embassy there.

The C-17 U.S. military aircraft brought a team of seven military personnel along with some equipment. An embassy statement said more supplies and personnel are expected in the coming days.

In Freetown, only the odd person can be seen on the streets as three-day lock-down continues across the country 

This shanty-town market area in Waterloo,Freetown should be packed with traders and shoppers but the area is almost deserted as residents obey the lock-down

Medics believe more than 560 people have died of Ebola in the current outbreak in Sierra Leone since the disease crossed the border from neighbouring Guinea 

Meanwhile in Guinea, The National Post reports that eight health officials and journalists were murdered after they arrived in a village to educate the residents about how to avoid transmitting Ebola. 

The residents of Womey, Guinea, attacked the health workers with knives and rocks fearing that they were bringing the disease to their village.

The Guinean government confirmed that six people had been arrested in connection with the murders. 

There have also been attacks on several health care centres as frightened villagers blame outsiders for bringing the disease to their areas.  

Many Freetown residents are happy to stay indoors for three days if it gives a realistic chance of combating the deadly disease which was first identified in the 1970s
