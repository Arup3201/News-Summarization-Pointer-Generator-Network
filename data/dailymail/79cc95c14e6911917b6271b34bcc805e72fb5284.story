Planet Earth is approaching the end of the annual Perseid Meteor Shower and hundreds of stunning photos have emerged of comets shooting across the sky. However, few are quite as impressive as a a collection of time-lapsed photos snapped by Associated Press photographer Blaine McCartney.

The photos show meteors streak above the Wyoming countryside early Tuesday morning north 
of Cheyenne in this time-elapsed photo.

The last few nights were the 
peak of the Perseids Meteor Shower, which run from mid-July through 
mid-August.

Amazing: About 50 to 60 meteors hit the Earth's atmosphere per hour during the peak of the Perseids Meteor Shower

The shower, which gets its name from the constellation, 
Persus, are the remants from the comet Swift-Tuttle, which passes by Earth once every 133 years.

As Earth's orbit brings it closer to the comet's orbit, debris from the comet gets sucked into Earth's atmosphere and burns up, creating what many call 'nature's fireworks.'

When the debris hits the atmosphere, it's traveling at about 100 kilometers per second.

The shower peaked on Sunday night leading into Monday morning, with roughly 50 to 60 visible meteors per hour.

During last year's shower, the hourly rate of meteors peaked at a stunning 173.

The last time the Swift-Tuttle Comet passed by Earth was 1992. It's not expected again until 2125.
