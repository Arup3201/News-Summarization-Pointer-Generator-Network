David Cameron today insisted it was still possible to win back powers from Brussels and secure Britain's place in Europe, despite last week's humiliating failure to stop Jean-Claude Juncker becoming EU president.

The Prime Minister told MPs the appointment of Mr Juncker over Britain's objections had made his renegotiation plan harder - but insisted that with 'real fortitude and real drive there's no reason why we can't succeed'.

He said he still wanted to change Britain's relationship with Brussels before fighting to stay in the EU. But Labour's Ed Miliband said his strategy was in 'tatters' adding: 'You were outwitted, outmanoeuvred and outvoted. You are a defeated Prime Minister who cannot deliver for Britain.'

The Prime Minister said he had stuck to his principles by refusing to support Jean-Claude Juncker. But Ed Miliband said: 'He just looks absurd'

Mr Miliband, the Labour leader, accused the Prime Minister of being unable to reform the EU

Mr Miliband said: 'He started with a divided Europe over Juncker's candidacy, and ended with a united Europe against him.'

The Labour leader added: 'Europe isn't unreformable, it's just he can't do it.' 

Mr Cameron responded: 'We have heard yet another performance worthy of Neil Kinnock  - endless words, endless wind.' The PM said Mr Miliband was 'weak, opportunist and wrong'.

He added 'I have to say I won't take lectures on negotiation from the people who gave away the veto, who gave away the rebate, who backed down on the budget every year, and who even signed us up to euro bailouts. We won't take any lectures from you.'

Mr Cameron was given vocal support from his backbenchers. Stewart Jackson said: 'I always knew he had lead in his pencil. I'm glad to see he has sharpened it.' 

Today's Commons debate came after the Prime Minister insisted it was possible to 'do business' with Mr Juncker - despite fighting tooth and nail to block him becoming President of the European Commission.

The Prime Minister last night called Mr Juncker to salute his appointment, despite having spent weeks trying in vain to persuade allies not to support him.

Mr Cameron insisted he wants to 'move on' from the bitter row, which left him isolated in Europe, and focus on his plans to claw powers back from Brussels. 

Mr Cameron’s phone call yesterday will be seen by critics as a 
humiliation for the Prime Minister, who was outvoted 26 to two in 
Brussels on Friday when he tried to stop the appointment of the 
arch-federalist.

Downing Street claimed that Mr Juncker had pledged his support for a ‘fair deal’ for Britain, and was ‘committed to finding solutions’ for the UK’s concerns about an over-centralised Europe.And Mr Cameron himself struck a bullish tone, writing in a newspaper article that he can still do business with Mr Juncker.

‘I
 am ready to move on and keep fighting for Britain’s interests in 
Europe,’ he wrote in the Daily Telegraph, adding: ‘Anyone in Europe who 
thought I was going to back down or blink is now thinking again.’

Responding
 to Mr Juncker’s claims during the nomination that he was ready to 
deliver a ‘fair deal’ to the UK, the PM wrote: ‘If by a fair deal, we 
can agree that we are not heading, at different speeds, to the same 
place – as some have assumed up to now – then there is some business we 
can do.’ 

Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Mr Cameron today insisted he can still secure reforms to Britain's relationship with Europe.

'I am ready to move on and keep fighting for Britain's interests in Europe,' he wrote.

Referring to previous claims by Mr Juncker that he was ready to deliver a 'fair deal' for Britain, Mr Cameron said: 'If by a fair deal, we can agree that we are not heading, at different speeds, to the same place - as some have assumed up to now - then there is business we can do.'

Mr Cameron said his decision to stick to his word showed he meant business.

He added: 'Anyone in Europe who thought I was going to back down or blink is now thinking again.'

Mr Cameron
 also faced criticism from within his own party, with former Chancellor 
Lord Lawson saying his pledge to get powers repatriated from Brussels 
was unlikely to be realised.

But
 the Cabinet rallied round, with Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt accusing 
other EU leaders of ‘cowardice’ for not following through on their 
private opposition to Mr Juncker. William Hague refused to agree it 
would be a ‘disaster’ if the UK left the European Union – saying it 
would be a matter for the voters in a referendum the Tories want to hold
 in 2017 if they are returned to office next year.

Mr
 Cameron spoke to Mr Juncker, the former Luxembourg prime minister and 
now Commission President-designate, yesterday afternoon.

Downing
 Street said: ‘The Prime Minister congratulated Mr Juncker on running a 
successful campaign and securing the Council nomination. They discussed 
how they would work together to make the EU more competitive and more 
flexible.

Shadow chancellor Ed Balls branded the failed negotiations a ‘catastrophe for Britain and the British national interest’

Lord Lawson said Mr Cameron has little chance of getting powers repatriated

‘Mr Juncker said he was fully committed to finding solutions for the political concerns of the UK.’

Mr
 Cameron had tried to garner support from other leaders for another 
candidate for the top job, saying Mr Juncker did not understand that 
voters wanted an EU that was smaller, less interfering, and less bossy.

But
 his failure to persuade them means many are unconvinced he will be able
 to get powers back from Brussels before the 2017 referendum. Margaret 
Thatcher’s former chancellor, Lord Lawson, who has moved from being one 
of the most Europhile Tories to an advocate of withdrawal, said Mr 
Cameron had little chance of getting powers repatriated.

‘He’s made it clear he’s going to vote for 'in' irrespective, so he has no negotiating hand to speak of,’ he said.

Labour’s
 Ed Balls branded the failed negotiations a ‘catastrophe for Britain and
 the British national interest’, adding: ‘I’ve never seen a negotiation 
so cack-handed.’

The Shadow Chancellor told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘He’s weak, he’s lost control, he’s on the back foot, Britain is suffering.’

Mr
 Hague said it was ‘far too early to say’ if the Government would fail 
in its bid to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with Brussels. ‘The 
Prime Minister acknowledged that the task had got harder when he spoke 
on Friday,’ he said. ‘But look at the track record of the last few 
years. He is the first Prime Minister to negotiate an actual reduction 
in the European budget.’

Asked
 if it would be a disaster to exit, he replied: ‘This will be the debate
 in the referendum. I have always argued against more power going to the
 European Union, but for us to be a member of Europe but not run by 
Europe. The British people will decide in a referendum whether that is 
sustainable or not.’

Germany’s
 finance minister last night said Berlin would do everything in its 
power to prevent Britain leaving the EU. Wolfgang Schäuble said a 
British exit from the EU was ‘unimaginable’, and that UK membership was 
important for Germany because London and Berlin share a market-oriented 
reform approach.

Fears intensified in Europe last night that Mr Juncker may not be able to cope with his new role because of his drinking habits.

Diplomatic sources in Brussels say it is advisable to catch him before lunch, because otherwise the alcohol can take its toll.

There were claims at the weekend from a former Tory minister in the Foreign Office that the new President of the European Commission drinks so heavily that he has been seen to dribble during meetings.

The situation is so bad, diplomatic sources claim, that he is often ‘incapable of working after lunchtime’. It has also been repeatedly suggested that he has ‘cognac for breakfast’ and that he has turned up ‘blind drunk’ at meetings.

Rumours of Mr Juncker’s drinking were so serious that his habits were discussed at the highest levels by European leaders in advance of Friday’s vote which handed him the Commission crown. But leaders went ahead and voted for him anyway.

The newly-elected Brussels boss raised eyebrows by apparently tweeting from a bar about his victory on Friday night.

Mr Juncker resigned as prime minister of Luxembourg last year following a spy scandal. One newspaper in the country, the Letzebuerg Privat, has referred to him as the country’s ‘drunken stupor premier’ and alleged that he drank ‘a Campari, three glasses of wine and three Sambucas in only two hours’.

In Britain, the former Tory minister told a newspaper at the weekend that ‘all the stories about Juncker’s drinking are true’.

‘I regarded it as pointless talking to him after 12 o’clock because at times he seemed incapable of working, so drunk you couldn’t get any sense out of him,’ he said. ‘It is every bit as bad as people say. I have seen him so p***** that he was dribbling.’
