Demand: Lyle Kercher, brother of Meredith Kercher, said America must 'practise what it preaches' and lock up Amanda Knox

Amanda Knox could face up to five years in jail in the US as she awaits extradition to Italy, it was revealed last night, as the family of her victim called for her to be ‘locked up while she waits’.

Top U.S. extradition lawyer Bruce Zagaris said if her latest conviction for the murder of Meredith Kercher is upheld  by the Italian Supreme Court, she will be put in jail.

Mr Zagaris said: ‘It is rare for the U.S. to deny extradition requests from allied countries like Italy. Her lawyers would have the chance to appeal and any extradition is a long, drawn-out process which takes between one to five years.

‘If Italy applies for extradition Knox would be arrested by marshals and placed in jail. She could apply for bail and may get it but it would be a close call. It’s likely that she will spend one to five years in jail in America while the process drags on.’

Meredith’s brother Lyle Kercher told The Mail on Sunday: ‘She should be locked up while the process goes on.  I don’t understand why a convicted criminal is not in custody. America needs to practise what it preaches. We see cases all the time where they’re trying to extradite people – Julian Assange, Edward Snowden. You can’t be going around saying one thing and doing another.

‘I would be surprised if America doesn’t accept it if Italy calls for extradition. It would make a mockery  of the word reciprocation.

‘We would like to see her extradited. I would like to see her imprisoned in Italy. I don’t think it’s right her remaining  in her own country.’

But a close friend of the Knox family, retired Seattle judge Michael Heavey, said: ‘There is no way Amanda will spend another night in jail.

'The overwhelming majority of the American public believe that she is the victim of a chronic miscarriage of justice and that she and indeed the Kercher family continue to be made victims by this charade going  on in Italy.

'There would be an outcry if anyone tried to place her in any US jail. It’s never going to happen.’

Perugia lawyer Marina Cancellotti said Knox’s ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 25, – who remained in Italy for the second trial where he was also re-convicted – could end up in prison while she remains free.

Cancellotti said: ‘Italy will ask for extradition but will not obtain anything. I mean who would send Knox back to Italy? We will have to weigh up what it means to live in Italy or the U.S. if Sollecito ends up in prison and Knox free in the States.’

'We will have to weigh up what it means': While Knox, right, may avoid prison, or spend years in America awaiting extradition, Raffaele Sollecitor, left, could be jailed much sooner

Knox, 26, could be put in Seatac Federal Detention Centre less than five miles from her father’s home in Seattle where Knox watched on TV as an Italian judge re-convicted her of murder on Thursday and sentenced her in her absence to 28 years and six months in jail.

The ultimate decision about whether to extradite Knox will rest with John Kerry, the U.S. Secretary of State who has refused to comment on the case.

Zagaris said: ‘There is always room for political pressure but the U.S. will likely extradite if the Italy government requests it because they will not want to get into a diplomatic row with Italy.’

Knox has told friends she has written to the Kercher family offering sympathy for their plight, but Meredith’s brother Lyle added: ‘If there’s a letter that has ever been sent to the family my parents never mentioned it and they would have.

'She’s never called or written a letter to say sorry for our loss or express any regret.’
