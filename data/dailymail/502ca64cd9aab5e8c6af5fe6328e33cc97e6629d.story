On a Wimbledon afternoon of brooding clouds, driving rain and seething frustration, the face of Rafael Nadal beamed out like a beacon.

For the world No1 has discovered his most formidable form when it matters most and the second week carries the promise of dramatic achievement. His satisfaction could not be concealed or contained.

His 6-7, 6-1, 6-1, 6-1 victory over Mikhail Kukushkin of Kazakhstan was scarcely unexpected but the manner of his triumph, the way in which he was required to solve his problems and find his game, was enormously impressive.

Comeback man: Rafael Nadal comfortably dispatched Mikhail Kukushkin after an early setback

The loss of the first set could almost have been a part of his grand plan, since it allowed him to flick through the gears before delivering a performance of towering authority.

He was watched from the Royal Box by some of the most imposingly regal figures in British sport. David Beckham, whose aristocratic credentials are increasingly accepted, Victoria Pendleton, of blessed Olympic memory, and Sir Bobby Charlton, whose blood runs as blue as anybody born to the purple. They stood as one when Nadal closed out his success, recognising a kindred spirit, acclaiming a champion at the peak of his powers.

The Spaniard would later express his delight in his progress. 'I finished all my matches playing better than when I started and that is very positive. I'm very happy to be in the second week after two years losing in the first and second rounds. I am fighting for every ball and playing to find the right solutions in every game.'

Ouch! The Spaniard lost the first set after a tense tiebreak on centre court on Saturday afternoon

From a man who is not given to idle chatter, it sounded distinctly ominous for his rivals.

Nadal plays tennis like a great fighter warming to his work. Watch him open his body to throw the big forehand and you see images of Hearns, Hagler and Leonard, that dazzling trinity of terrifying middleweights.

The intent is mean, the execution savagely impeccable, the effect disastrous. In the thin, grey light beneath the Centre Court roof, with the rain splattering the crowds outside and June wearing the colours of January, the similarity was irresistible. And it was a genuine contest, a real match for an hour of the first unpredictable set.

Kukushkin, ranked 63 in the world, went for his shots without fear of consequence. And the greater the gamble, the greater the reward. The first serve was testing, the double-fisted backhand a blunt weapon. Hard as Nadal worked and chased, his unfancied opponent found most of the answers. His tie-break success was awarded the clamorous approval of the Centre Court crowd.

Given a right runaround! Kukushkin struggled to cope once he took the first set as Nadal progressed easily

'He played fantastic in that first set,' said Nadal. 'I was thinking: "If he is able to play like that for three sets, I will be in trouble".'

He considered his problems on an extended toilet break at the close of the set. When he emerged, to the faint disapproval of that crowd, he was a man restored.

Mild incontinence is a besetting affliction of certain tennis stars, especially when they have just lost a set, but he seemed surprised at the faint hint that he had been guilty of gamesmanship. 'I needed to go to the bathroom, that's all. It wasn't because I wanted to have a break. I needed it.'

With a truly English reticence on such matters, his questioners did not press him further. In any event, the change in his game was impossibly dramatic.

The great ones in any sport can lift their form when they most need to and Nadal simply flicked a switch and surged away. Aware that he had lost the opening set of both his matches last week, Nadal was also aware that he could find himself at will. And so it proved.

He broke Kukushkin in the fourth game of the second set and from there his course was set.

A little bit damp: Wimbledon was a sea of umbrellas on a miserable day in SW19

As the winners began to flow, as the pace was raised and the angles became more improbable, his opponent seemed almost visibly to shrink. The warrior of the first set now wore the nervous apprehension of a bank clerk plucked from the crowd and furnished with a racquet. Where his problems had once seemed so simple, now they were far beyond solution. Nadal hustled through the second set in 35 minutes and the third in 28.

At times, we wanted to look away, the way we used to when Hagler had trapped some pain-racked victim on the ropes. There was one hopelessly outclassed contender who asked his manager for the best way to approach a fight with Marvellous Marvin.

'Don't make him angry,' came the useful response. Poor Kukushkin could have employed a similar tactic.

Game followed game in unchallenged monotony, with the fourth set going the way of its predecessors.

'I played aggressive, I had great movement, I just felt great,' said Nadal. 'Nobody can say this is not a special place.'

Likewise, nobody can say that this is not a remarkably special player. There were times yesterday when he wore that air of invulnerability, times when he seemed quite unplayable.

All may change over this crucial week, of course. The likes of Murray, Djokovic, even Federer may come up with the answers which were way beyond Kukushkin.

But the current signs are enormously encouraging for Nadal. Champion in 2008 and 2010, his chances of a third title were shining brightly through the Wimbledon gloom.
