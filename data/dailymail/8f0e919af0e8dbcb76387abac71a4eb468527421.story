Soul diva Aretha Franklin has some harsh words for a server who showed D-I-S-R-E-S-P-E-C-T by telling the Queen of Soul she wasn't allowed to eat her takeout inside the restaurant.

A spokesman for Franklin says the situation unfolded Tuesday at a Johnny Rockets restaurant on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls.

The spokesman says Franklin ordered a hamburger after performing a sold-out show.

But he says the server screamed at Franklin, saying she couldn't sit down to eat because she ordered takeout.

Franklin issued a statement stating that the worker was 'very rude, unprofessional and nasty.'

The employee, who it can only be assumed was unaware she was dealing with the Queen of Soul, told Franklin she was not allowed to eat the burger she had ordered as a post-show meal inside the restaurant because she had ordered it to go.

The 72-year-old had dropped into the faux-'50s diner for a bite after her sold-out performance at the Artpark Outdoor Amphitheater in Lewiston.

A Johnny Rockets spokeswoman says the franchise owner is sorry for the actions of 'a new and very young employee.'

She says the owner has spoken with the employee and has clarified the takeout policies.
