A stunned relative of the three victims of the Cumberland Hotel hammer attack sent out a series of desperate tweets moments after it happened, it was revealed today.

Shekha Al Mauhairi, 18, was staying next door and ran down from the seventh 
floor to the first screaming for help after the female tourists were hit in the face and head in a brutal attack.

She said on Twitter: 'I am 18 years old and someone has attacked my family.'

She then tweeted: 'I'm in London. Some foreigner from London came and attacked us.'

In a final tweet she said that she has
 now moved to another hotel and is being looked after by security. Her 
tweets have since been deleted.

Khalood
 Al Muhairi, 36, remains in a 'critical' condition in hospital more than
 48 hours after being attacked at the four star Cumberland Hotel off 
Oxford Street in central London.

She is reported to have been placed in an induced coma.

It
 is understood two other women injured in the same incident in the early
 hours of Sunday and now recovering at a London hospital are her sisters
 Fatimah Al Muhairi, 31, and 34-year-old Ohoud Al Muhairi.

All three women, from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), were enjoying a break in London with their children and other relatives.

Their attacker is still being hunted by police.

Guests
 staying at the Cumberland Hotel in Marble Arch said they have been 
warned by their Embassy to be careful of thieves following the incident.

Fatima
 Al Hammadi, 28, who is from Abu Dhabi in the UAE and is staying at The 
Cumberland with 10 family members, said: 'We came for relaxation, but 
when we heard about this we were just really surprised.

'We
 have heard of these things happening in Thailand, but never here. The 
youngest, Shekha, has spoken about it on Twitter. Everyone knows about 
it.

The women, who are in their thirties, had travelled to London for a shopping spree from their home in the United Arab Emirates

'The Embassy contacted 
us about being careful of thieves. We have been to the Embassy today and
 have asked them to move us to another hotel.

'We
 don't care about the money - we want to get out, we don't feel safe 
here. We don't know how the attackers could have got in, you need a key 
card to use the lift.

'It's 
all over the newspapers. A newspaper in the Gulf has an interview with 
one of their brothers Badar al-Ansari, who said that London was like his
 second home and completely safe, but now he's scared.'

The UAE's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) has said they are closely following the case.

'There
 are special agencies following up the case in co-ordination with our 
embassy in London,' the MoFA official in charge of nationals, Rashid Al 
Dhaahiri said.

The UAE 
ambassador to London, Abdulrahman Ghanim Al Mutaiwee, said they are 
working 'with a number of security agencies in a bid to apprehend the 
offenders.'

The Ambassador 
added that he was hopeful that the 'advanced technology in the hotel 
will be used to identify and apprehend the offender who we believe had a
 motive of robbery.'
