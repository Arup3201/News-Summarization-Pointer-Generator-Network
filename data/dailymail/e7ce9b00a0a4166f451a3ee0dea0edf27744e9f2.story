Britain's overheating housing market finally appears to be cooling - as figures revealed mortgage lending had stalled last month.

Some £16.5 billion-worth of home loans were handed out in May, matching the figure for the month before according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders said.

Despite holding steady month-on-month, lending is still 'substantially' higher than a year ago, with lending in May some 12 per cent higher than the year before.

After months of increased lending, mortgage lending finally slowed down in May. The figures come amid growing evidence that the housing market is slowly starting to cool

Council of Mortgage Lenders chief Bob Pannell blamed the 'softening in the pace of recovery' was linked to tougher mortgage rules which came into force at the end of April.

He said the recent 'softening in the pace of recovery' would appear to back up reports that demand in London, where the market has been at its most heated, is starting to cool.

The new Mortgage Market Review rules mean lenders have to grill mortgage applicants more thoroughly about their spending habits, to make sure that their repayments will be affordable.

Chancellor George Osborne announced plans last week to hand the Bank of England powerful new tools which would give it the power to cap the size of mortgages based on people's salaries or the value of the house.

It comes after the Business Secretary Vince Cable warned against a premature rise in interest rates.

The Lib Dem Cabinet Minister sounded the alarm about homebuyers who are being lent mortgages equal to ‘five times’ their salary.

An outspoken critic of Britain’s banks, Mr Cable questioned whether such super-size loans were ‘sensible’.

Chancellor George Osborne has introduced new rules for banks to check whether families can afford mortgage repayments, in a bid to avoid a fresh house price bubble

He warned that the overheating housing market could lead to a premature rise in interest rates which would jeopardise the recovery.

Mr Cable said: ‘There is a risk that the destabilising effects of the rise in house prices, certainly in London and the South East, potentially has a major impact on the economy as a whole.

‘If, for example, interest rates were to rise sooner than they otherwise would have done on the basis of the overall position of the economy, then this potentially is a negative consequence of the imbalance that is happening.’

His comments came as the Bank of England gave its strongest signal yet that interest rates will rise before the end of the year – pushing up mortgage costs of millions of families.

Mr Cable said a home loan which is five times bigger than a worker’s salary ‘must raise all kinds of questions about whether this is sensible for lenders and sensible for borrowers’.

Mr Cable said the ‘traditional’ model was to lend around three to 3.5 times’ somebody’s salary.

The Office for National Statistics this week said house prices have risen by nearly 19 per cent in London over the last year. This is the second fastest rise in house prices in the capital since its records began, and means the average London home now costs nearly £500,000.

In Mr Cable’s constituency of Twickenham, the average person who lives in the leafy London borough and works full-time in the area earns £33,000. But the average house price is nearly £595,000, according to the property website Zoopla.

If they want to buy a house, they would need to borrow a mortgage which is 18 times bigger than their salary.

The Bank of England this week dropped hints that interest rates could rise sooner than expected, which would add to the costs of mortgage-holders, although any increase is expected to be gradual.

Average UK house prices have hit a new peak of £260,000 after leaping by 9.9 per cent over the last year, according to figures released by the Office for National Statistics this week.

But in a sign of what is to come, property website Rightmove also reported this week that it is seeing evidence that house-sellers’ asking prices are starting to come 'off the boil', with property values in some parts of London appearing to have hit the ceiling of what buyers will pay.

Rightmove said the new Government rules have already dampened housing market demand, with estate agents reporting that some lenders are initially applying the new rules in a 'knee jerk' way, leading to house sales falling through.

The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has also said that the recent sharp rises in some house prices and the stricter mortgage lending rules are starting to take some of the strongest heat out of the property market.

Speculation that further steps could be taken to cool the market has also been growing.
