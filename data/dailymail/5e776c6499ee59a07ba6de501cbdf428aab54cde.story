An alleged murderer tried to claim a reward from police after providing details on a drive-by shooting he was involved in, a court heard today.

Isaac Dawson, 27, informed officers of the whereabouts of two weapons used in the murder of teenager Nana Darko-Frempong.

The 18-year-old was gunned down outside his house in Tulse Hill, South London, for 'being in the wrong place at the wrong time'.

Trial: Nana-Darko Frempong, 18, (pictured) who was gunned down outside his home in Tulse Hill, South London, in what prosecutors say was a motiveless act. Eight people are on trial at the Old Bailey accused of involvement in the murder

The Old Bailey heard how Dawson had told an ex-girlfriend that the teenager had been 'bodied' with a sawn-off shotgun and pistol.

He is now standing trial with 
eight others who allegedly took part in the motiveless killing.

Dawson first phoned police four months after the murder, giving the names of Christopher Gabriel and Nathan Deacon as two of the killers - both of whom have also been charged with murder.

Police recovered two weapons in a flat above a Best One convenience store on the High 
Trees Estate in Tulse Hill, following Dawson's tip-off.

The weapons in the flat, which was occupied by Sachia 
Clarke, 22, were forensically matched to firearms residue at the scene of the 
shooting.

Prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC told the court that Dawson had sought a reward for 
'providing information in connection with a murder that he himself had 
taken part in'.

He added: 'That was why he had been able to 
tell police all about the shooting of Nana Darko-Frempong, that was why 
he was able to tell them all about where the guns might be found. 
Because he himself was involved.'

The court heard how the victim was 'almost home' when the occupants of a grey Ford Focus opened fire on him.

Two guns were then fired at the teenager from a distance of only a few feet, before the 'driver of the car then put his foot down and raced off'.

Reward: Isaac Dawson, 27, informed officers of the whereabouts of two weapons used in the murder and the names of two of the alleged killers. The Old Bailey heard how he then asked police for a reward

Mr Darko-Frempong had been hit in the face and stomach and collapsed as his parents rushed down from their flat.

They were moved away as paramedics 
tried to save their son, assuming the fact he was not being rushed to 
hospital meant he was not seriously hurt.

But the parents then experienced what was described in court as 'every parent's worst nightmare', when their son was pronounced dead at the scene.

The car was was later set ablaze in nearby Camberwell.

Two weeks after Dawson had phoned police with information on the weapons' whereabouts, he once again called police.

Mr Aylett said: 'He must have heard about what the police had found in the flat above the Best One shop.'

'He now rang to ask the police for a 
reward. The police told him they could not give him a reward unless they
knew his name. He gave the name. It was Isaac Dawson.'

Nine months later his girlfriend, and the mother of his son, told police how Dawson had confessed his involvement to her.

'The night after the murder Dawson had gone to visit her. He had been unable to sit still,' Mr Aylett said.

He told her that a 'madness happened' and confessed he had 'bodied' someone.

She was appalled and asked him 'how can you do something like that', to which he replied 'It wasn't just me, it was like three men shooting at him'.

Mr Aylett said there was no known motive for the murder, telling jurors: 'There is nothing to indicate anyone had any reason to harm Nana Darko-Frempong.'

'Furthermore, although he was shot 
outside his home address, there is no reason to believe he was expected 
home at any specific time.

'Whoever was responsible for the 
murder was able at short notice to call upon a number of willing 
assistants to help with the destruction of the dark grey Ford Focus that
had been used by the gunmen.

'Nana it would seem, must have been in the wrong place at the wrong time.'

Dawson, Tafari Deacon, also 27, 
Christopher Gabriel, 25,  and 
Nathan Deacon, 25, all deny murder

Romario Henry, 21, Christopher Broderick, 26, and Nathaniel Solomon, 23, deny 
perverting the course of justice by setting the car alight.

Al Daniels, 22,  and Sachia Clarke deny firearms offences.

The trial continues.
