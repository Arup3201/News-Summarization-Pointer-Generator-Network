The formation of Tropical Storm Andrea in the Gulf of Mexico officially kicked off hurricane season in the Atlantic, putting many along Florida's west coast under this year’s first tropical storm warning Wednesday.

Forecasters predict Andrea to slam the west coast of Florida on Thursday before moving northeast, according to the National Hurricane Center.

The tropical storm warning covered Florida's Gulf Coast from the southern tip at Boca Grande to Ochlockonee River in the panhandle.

Here she comes: Andrea, the first named storm of the Atlantic season, forms over the Gulf of Mexico. The tropical storm is likely to bring wet weather to parts of Florida's west coast by the end of the week

The first warning comes just two weeks after the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted the 2013 Atlantic hurricane season to be particularly 'active'.

'This year, oceanic and atmospheric conditions in the Atlantic basin are expected to produce more and stronger hurricanes,' said Gerry Bell, the lead seasonal hurricane forecaster with NOAA's Climate Prediction Center. 'These conditions include weaker wind shear, warmer Atlantic waters and conducive winds patterns coming from Africa.'

Tropical Storm Andrea developed in the Gulf of Mexico in the last few days, inching toward Florida at 3 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center.

The storms slow movement is expected to continue through Wednesday night, with maximum winds of 40 mph. Andrea is supposed to pick up speed on Thursday, continuing its movement through Friday.

Andrea's center should reach Florida's 'Big Bend'—the intersection of the peninsula and panhandle—on Thursday afternoon, the center reported. It will then move over southeastern  Georgia and eastern South Carolina on Thursday night and Friday.

The Weather Channel reported the 'main concern' from Andrea will be heavy rainfall in Florida, which is expected to continue through Friday, because of a combination of upper atmosphere wind shear and dry air on the storm system’s west side. The effect traps the heaviest winds on the east side of the system.

Localized flooding throughout the peninsula could result from Andrea's heavy rain. The Weather Channel also reported isolated tornadoes could develop by Thursday.

Andrea may also enhance rainfall along the East Coast.
