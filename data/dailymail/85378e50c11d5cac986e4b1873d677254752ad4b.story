BBC star presenter Fiona Bruce, pictured, seems unimpressed by Sudbury, famous for being the birthplace of 18th-century painter Thomas Gainsborough

She reads the news with unwavering 
impartiality. But in her role as a part-time travel writer, Fiona Bruce 
is finding that offering her opinions is a much riskier business.

She has been hit by an angry backlash from a Suffolk town after some rather frank observations in her newspaper column.

She
described Sudbury as recession-hit and complained it has too many 
charity shops. And she committed the even greater faux pas of describing
one of its best-loved churches as a ‘relic’.

Locals said the comments 
were ‘utter rubbish’ and criticised her journalistic skills, telling her
to return to the town to look round properly.

The Antiques Roadshow presenter’s column, Fiona Bruce’s Britain in The Daily Telegraph, highlights ‘unsung attractions’.

However,
it seems Miss Bruce was left unimpressed by Sudbury, famous as the 
birthplace of 18th-century painter Thomas Gainsborough.

She
said the ‘recession has taken its toll’, adding: ‘There are forlorn 
empty premises and an overabundance of charity shops.’

Miss Bruce seemed
particularly unenthusiastic about St Peter’s Church in the  centre of 
the town.

‘[It] was built 
during the 15th century on a Norman site, its pews once full of local 
folk singing hymns,’ she wrote.

‘Now it’s a relic of past observance, no
people, not even a pew.’

The Friends of St Peter’s, which looks after the church, hit back at the comments.

Town
councillor Peter Gray, who is on the committee, said: ‘St Peter’s was 
closed for public worship in 1971 but it is one of the most used 
redundant churches in Britain and is second only to one in York for  
visitor numbers.

'It is booked two years in advance for events ranging 
from farmers’ markets to concerts.’

The Friends of St Peter's, which looks after the church, pictured, said Miss Bruce had 'missed the point'. Town Councillor Peter Gray said it is 'one of the most used redundant churches in Britain'

Councillor Lesley Ford-Platt criticised Miss Bruce’s journalism.

She said: ‘She is talking utter rubbish. I do not know what day she came – it sounds like 6pm on a Sunday. 

‘I
am really disappointed she would say these things. She is influential, 
she is a respected journalist. What she had down is a snapshot of the 
town without looking at what’s actually offered.

‘Yes, Sudbury has some charity shops but there is a huge number of independent traders.’

Roger
Green, chairman of the Friends of St Peter’s, added: ‘We have composed a
letter to Miss Bruce inviting her to return to Sudbury to see the 
things she obviously missed the first time around.’

Last night Miss Bruce was  unavailable for comment.
