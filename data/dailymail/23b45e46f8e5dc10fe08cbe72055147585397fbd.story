Most of us take telling the time for granted. But for visually impaired people it can be a real struggle and sometimes a speaking clock just isn’t practical.

However, a new tactile watch is about to hit the shops that lets people tell the time just by touching it – and it’s so stylish that many people with perfect vision are also ordering one for themselves.

The Bradley Timepiece has a minimalistic titanium face with gently protruding markings, but no numbers or hands.

It's about time! The Bradley Timepiece (pictured left) lets people tell the time using their sense of touch. It is named after Paralympic gold medal winner Bradley Snyder (pictured right) and features two distinctive grooves with ball bearings set inside them that denote the minutes and hours of the day

Instead of traditional watch hands, time is indicated by two ball bearings.

The one towards the centre of the watch indicates the passing minutes and one marking the hours is positioned on the side.

The ball bearings are connected to a watch movement beneath the casing with magnets.

If the ball bearings are pressed a little too hard and are moved accidently, a user can shake their wrist and they spring back to show the correct time.

Its unique feature is two ball bearings set into grooves that people can touch to tell the time.

The ball in the central groove rotates to mark the minutes, while another set into the side of the timepiece travels round the face to denote the hours.

Designer Hyungsoo Kim, CEO of E-onetime, which is based in Washington DC, designed the quirky timepiece while he was a student at MIT.

‘Most clocks and watches require vision and checking the time is still a big problem if you're visually impaired. We wanted to develop a timepiece where you can touch time,’ he said.

‘This is a timepiece and not a watch because you don’t have to watch this to tell the time.’

Touch the time: As well as helping visually impaired people live independently Mr Kim explained it's been a hit with people with perfect sight too. There are occasions - from lectures and job interviews to dinner with the in-laws - when looking at a watch is considered rude and telling the time by touch solves that problem, he said

Because of its striking design, the timepiece is proving a hit with everyone and Mr Kim explained that there are so many occasions – from lectures and job interviews to dinner with the in-laws – when looking at a watch or smartphone is considered rude and telling the time by touch solves the problem.

The Bradley Timepiece is named after a Paralympian gold medallist who lost his sight in Afghanistan.

Lieutenant Bradley Snyder served with the U.S. Navy in Afghanistan, dealing with unexploded devices, until one day in 2011 he was blinded when one of the IEDs blew up in his face.

While he went on to win two gold medals and a silver in swimming at the 2012 Paralympics in London, adjusting to everyday life was difficult for him – particularly telling the time.

Mr Synder told the BBC: ‘You don't realise how much you use time to orient where you are. At the beginning it was very disorienting. And especially being in the military, time is all important.’

After meeting Mr Lim through a mutual friend, he became the face of the watch, which is hoped will change many more people’s lives when it launches this summer.

Mr Synder had been using a speaking watch, but said: ‘as soon as I hit that button it highlights me as someone with a special need. I love the idea of using the same thing that everyone does. And I want to feel as normal as possible.’

There are a number of watches for visually impaired people currently available, including one that vibrates to denote the hour and minutes of the day, those with tactile or braille faces – which look similar to traditional watches – and of course the talking watches.

Neil Heslop, RNIB Group Director Solutions, told MailOnline: 'Design is just as important for people with sight loss as it is for sighted people.

'What’s great about the Bradley Timepiece is that it is accessible to everyone but it also looks good and that combination is incredibly powerful.'

Colourful: Despite initially being developed for people who cannot see how good their watch looks, the Bradley Timepiece is up for design of the year at London's Design Museum and its slick titanium body gives it widespread appeal. The timepiece is even available with three different coloured straps

The Bradley Timepiece is up for design of the year at London’s Design Museum and its slick titanium body gives it widespread appeal. The timepiece is even available with three different coloured straps.

Mr Kim and his team of designers originally raised money on crowd funding website Kickstarter last summer to put their product into production, attracting $594,602 (£357,290).

The ‘watch’ launches in the U.S. in May for $195 (£117) if it is pre-ordered and $275 (£164) thereafter. It will be available in the UK and Europe later in the year.

The company said that just one to two per cent of people that have so far pre-ordered the watch are visually impaired.

It is one of 76 nominations for the Designs of the Year competition at London’s Design Museum.

Getting into the groove: The watch has a deep groove running around the side of its face to show what hour it is. It might look chunky, but it is made of lightweight titanium. If a ball bearing is pushed too hard, a user can shake the watch and it will go back to the correct position again
