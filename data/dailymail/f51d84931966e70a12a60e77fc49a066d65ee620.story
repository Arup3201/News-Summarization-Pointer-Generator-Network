A 'senseless' thief was filmed stealing two live koi carp by stuffing them into his pockets in a 'sickening' act of cruelty. 

CCTV footage captured the man walking around Aquatic Supplies Wales in Swansea before hovering around the tanks where the exotic fish were kept. 

He plunged his hands into the water, dropping one of the £60 fish before trying repeatedly to put it in his pocket.  

The thief was filmed putting fish in each of his pockets before walking out of the aquatics store in Swansea

Eventually he made off with two of the creatures, with staff at the store unaware of his crime until they reviewed the footage later. 

'It was really sickening to watch, 'I've never seen anything like it,' said Dani Grogan, who works at the shop. 

'We were thinking maybe he’d have a bucket of water out in his car - but he didn't intend on stealing the fish to keep, he just put it in his pocket to kill it.

'It doesn't make any sense whatsoever, it’s just a horrible thing to have seen.'

Footage shows the man walking towards the back of the store to where the expensive fish are kept. 

He lifted one small carp out of its tank with his bare hands then returned to try to steal a larger creature with a handheld net. 

After around four minutes the thief walked out of the shop with a fish in each pocket. 

Staff at the shop did not realise the fish had been stolen until they reviewed CCTV footage of the crime

Determined to identify the person in the tape Miss Grogan shared the footage on the Aquatic Supplies Wales Facebook page. 

It was viewed more than 30,000 times with customers eager to help find the thief. 

'We had to do something and all our customers wanted to help,' said Miss Grogan's partner and the shop's owner, Thomas Dodd.

'We love running this shop and work hard to pay the bills. It is terrible when someone abuses it like this.'

The couple have reported the incident to South Wales Police. 

'Police have received a report of theft from the Aquatic Supplies store in Fforestfach, Swansea which happened at around midday on Friday 27th February,' a spokesman for the force said. 

'The theft is being investigated and anyone who has any information is asked to call 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously 0800 555 111 quoting occurrence number 1500076456.' 

Dani Grogan, pictured with the shop's owner, Thomas Dodd, said the crime was 'sickening and senseless'
