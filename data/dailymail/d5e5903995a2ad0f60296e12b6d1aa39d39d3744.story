Horrified: Becky Livesey, 21, has spoken of her 'shock' after discovering photos from her Facebook page had been used to create fake dating profiles

A 21-year-old marketing executive has spoken of her horror after discovering photos from her Facebook page had been used to create fake dating profiles.

Becky Livesey, from Blackburn, Lancashire, came across the stolen 'selfies' after an IT worker grew suspicious of a 'girl' he was speaking to online.

They had been used on dating site Plenty of Fish and Facebook - alongside nude photos of other women.

Ms Livesey then tracked down the culprit, radio producer Stuart Grant - before challenging him on networking site LinkedIn.

She has now received a personal apology from Mr Grant, who works for Capital Xtra in London.

Today, Ms Livesey said she was 'shocked and scared' to discover that her Facebook photos had been used to create fake dating profiles.

She said: 'The IT worker said he had been chatting to a "girl" online and that her pictures were actually of me - and it went from there.

'I just felt shocked and, when I realised he had sent nude photos of other women from the neck down pretending to be me, I felt scared my reputation was on the line.

'Stuart Grant could have spoken to someone who thought it was genuinely me. It's quite scary to think someone can easily pretend to be me.'

She said the unnamed IT worker had been chatting to a girl called Chelly on Facebook when he became suspicious and demanded proof that she was who she claimed to be.

He asked for a photo of her holding up three fingers - and what he received was an image of Ms Livesey lying on her bed that had been clearly digitally altered

'The picture he added the hands onto is actually my no-make up selfie I did for cancer awareness,' said Ms Livesey. 'They are not my hands - they're massive.'

Culprit: He then told Ms Livesey, who tracked down the culprit - Capital Xtra producer Stuart Grant (pictured)

The IT worker then traced the pictures back to their original source - and while doing so, came across a separate account using her pictures, in the name of Chelly Chaz Hume.

He later searched for Ms Livesey's Facebook account and told her about the stolen photos, which are believed to have also featured on Plenty of Fish.

Ms Livesey then tracked down the culprit and determined it was Mr Grant, before challenging him on LinkedIn. 

Apology: The marketing executive has now received a personal apology (pictured) from Mr Grant, from London

'As soon as I connected with him, he sent me a huge message apologising. He admitted what he did and said sorry,' she said.

I replied saying, "well done for being honest but you can't just pretend to be someone else just because you are a prat".

'Then he deleted his account. I'm so lucky that somebody drew my attention to what was happening.'

Ordeal: Today, Ms Livesey said she felt 'shocked, scared and violated' after discovering the dating profiles

Mr Grant is believed to have met some of the biggest names in the music industry during his 
career, including Alicia Keys, Neyo and Nicki Minaj.

In his apology to Ms Livesey, the radio producer admitted he had 'made some very bad choices'.

He wrote: 'What I have done is completely wrong and I absolutely should not have done this.

'I was caught up in a very bad place where my behaviour was wrong. It's a very long and tragic story and I let things go way beyond where they should.

Warning: She has now made her profile on Facebook private - and is warning others to do the same

'What I did was use some of your pictures and create a fake profile. I want to be absolutely clear on this point: It was wrong. I will never do it again. I should never have done it in the first place.

'I can promise with my hand on my heart, this has stopped. I have deleted everything and there are no more fake profiles, photos, or anything, in existence. I want this to be over for good.

'I know you don't know me but I hope you believe me when I say that my intention was not to hurt anybody.

'I was deeply in love with someone and behaved out of character and made some very bad choices.

'Using your photos was a horrible thing to do and I would feel pretty awful if someone had done it to me.'

In a statement he added: 'I am incredibly sorry for my actions. I am ashamed, and understand that I've caused upset and therefore apologise unreservedly.'

Ms Livesey said she had made her Facebook profile private following the ordeal - and is warning others to do the same.

'I now know how important it is to double check your privacy settings on social-networking sites,' she added.

'People might think it's my fault for having my pictures out there but I didn't realise. I always thought my profile was private but I'd never made sure.

'I hope this shows people how easy it is for people to steal your identity and that could be really dangerous, especially on dating websites.

'I feel really violated by it all and I worry that somebody will see me in the street and think I've been sending out naked pictures of myself.'

Lancashire Police said the issue was a 'grey area' and it was not immediately clear whether any crime had been committed.
