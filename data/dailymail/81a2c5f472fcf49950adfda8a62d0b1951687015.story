Their reputation suggests they may be reluctant to, but Yorkshiremen can well afford to stand their round in the pub, research suggests.

Along with those in the North West and North East they enjoy the cheapest pints in the country, a study has shown.

And they have the advantage of supping their pints while tucking into some of the best pub food in the most pleasant surroundings in the UK, according to the Good Pub guide.

The guide found that pies are the most popular food item in pubs

A pint of your favourite bitter would 
cost you £2.87 on average in the North West, North East and Yorkshire, 
compared with £3.15 in London and the South East, the guide found.

But cost is not the only reason to head up north - the guide also states that city pubs lack the 'character' and 'charm' to be found in country inns.

It described town and city drinking holes as 'pleasant enough', with 'okay' levels of service, 
but said it appeared that furnishings often came from a vast warehouse hidden away in an anonymous
'off-motorway wasteland'.

Pubs brewing their own ale charge just under £2.50 a pint, with scarcely any increase over the past year, compared with a seven per cent rise every where else, said the guide.

North West, North East and Yorkshire  £2.87

Heart of England £2.88

Wales £2.90

South West £2.95

East Midlands £2.99

East of England £3.04

Scotland £3.11

London  £3.15

Pie and ale is what most people want as the annual guide also discovered that 
the most popular food pub goers went for was steak and ale 
pie, closely followed by fish and chips, often given a boozy spin by 
being 'beer-battered'.

Lasagne scored zero in a list of top food choices, with curry, sausage and mash and ham and egg also slipping well down the popularity stakes.

Good quality coffee was said to be available in nearly all good pubs, although the guide said it was a 'shame' that almost half of pubs in the UK did not open until noon.

Fiona Stapley, editor of the Good Pub Guide, said: 'Today's number one food choice for pub-goers is steak in ale pie, in all it glorious variations: steak in ale-Guinness-stout-red wine, with mushrooms, stilton, kidneys, oysters.

'Other pies follow, like all types of 
fish, chicken, pork, lamb, rabbit, shepherd's, venison, wild boar, 
duckling, goose. And they love suet puddings too.'

Charm: Country pubs like The Fountaine Inn in Linton near the Yorkshire Dales have more 'character' than their city counterparts

Pricey: Customers are expected to part with more cash for food and drink at venues like The Hemingway gastro pub in London's Victoria

The guide, launched 30 years ago, lists pubs, landlords and dining pubs of the year.

Paul Nuttall, UKIP's deputy leader, said: 'It comes as no surprise that in these challenging economic times that folk are plumping for pub comfort food with dishes such as steak and ale pie and fish and chips. It is the kind of food that Britain does best.

Thrifty: The Good Pub Guide has found it is cheaper to enjoy your favourite tipple in northern parts of the UK

'However, the Government could do 
more to make the pint of a pub-goer cheaper by not increasing excise 
duty by two per cent above the rate of inflation every year.

'Such a move is destroying Britain's pub trade and stunting growth.'

Paul Maloney, national officer of the 
GMB said: 'Since the Good Pub Guide was first published the Beer Orders 
were introduced in 1989.

'The aim was to foster competition

to increase consumer choice and bring down prices.

'The opposite of this aim has been achieved. The average price for a pint of lager in Britain has risen by 80p higher than justified by inflation and changes in taxes in pubs, as property companies replaced brewers as owners.

'Local pubs owned by property companies have been priced out of the market and widespread pub closures have resulted particularly in working class areas in Britain.

He added that the average price of a pint of lager increased by 46 per cent between 1991 and 2000 compared to a 27 per cent rise in inflation. Between 2000 and 2010 the average price of a pint of lager increased by 47 per cent compared to a 31 per cent increase in inflation, said Mr Maloney.
