Gordon Brown was heckled by angry an Scottish nationalist today after returning to front line politics to rescue Alistair Darling’s flailing campaign against independence.

The former Prime Minster was labelled ‘an absolute disgrace’ by pro-independence supporter Mike Barile after delivering his rallying call for the Union

Mr Barile, a Labour supporter who was struck off as a teacher for assaulting two pupils, shouted ‘rubbish’ before he was removed from the Dundee meeting half way through the Labour MP’s address.

Scottish nationalist Mike Barile heckled the former Prime Minister Gordon Brown today as he spoke at a Better Together rally in Dundee

Mr Barile, who allegedly gave a false name to gain entry to Mr Brown's speech, called the former Prime Minister 'an absolute disgrace'

Mr Barile said he became infuriated after Mr Brown praised Mr Darling’s leadership over the last few weeks. He said: 'As a Labour voter, I was disgusted at the message they were sending.'

Today's rally, which came just days after Monday’s dramatic TV debate over independence, saw Mr Brown and Mr Darling put aside their differences to share the stage in support of the union.

Mr Darling, leader of the pro-UK Better Together campaign, served as chancellor when Mr Brown was in charge at 10 Downing Street.

Mr Brown allegedly tried to replace the Better Together leader with Ed Balls during the financial crisis – while Mr Darling has admitted considering joining a plot to get rid of the Prime Minister.

Mr Brown today insisted it was a ‘pleasure to sit alongside Alistair Darling’ who he praised for leading the Better Together campaign.

He said: ‘For the last two years [he] has done the incredibly difficult job, which we must now thank him for, of bringing together all the parties under the banner of Better Together.’

Mr Brown today claimed Scottish independence would only benefit the rich – because of the promised business tax breaks offered by Mr Salmond.

The former PM said the biggest winners from independence would be wealthy business bosses

Mr Brown told the audience that while the nationalists ‘dine out’ on ideas of equality, they have ‘no plans to raise funds that would come from a fairer taxation system’.

‘They dine out on Scottish ideas of equality - they talk as if they actually believe it,’ he said.

‘But when you look at the actual policies of the SNP, there is not one measure in their document that suggests there would be a higher rate of income tax for those at the very top, or a millionaire's tax at the top of council tax, or a mansion tax at the top of stamp duty, or even the bankers' bonus tax that is proposed for the UK.

‘They have no way of raising the money to pay for all the expensive promises they have made.’

Mr Brown returned to front line politics today after his former Chancellor Mr Darling was mauled by Mr Salmond on Monday

Mr Brown said SNP proposals to cut corporation tax would benefit large companies, including energy firms.

‘The biggest beneficiaries of the SNP's tax policy are the shareholders and directors of the privatised energy companies in Scotland,’ he said.

‘The beneficiaries of an independent Scotland are not the ordinary people of Scotland but the richest directors of the most profitable, privatised companies in Scotland.

‘When you look at the Scottish National Party policies, inequality and poverty will survive until doomsday if Alex Salmond is all that confronts it.’
