Good news: Billy Connolly last night announced he had been given the all-clear from prostrate cancer

Billy Connolly has been given the all-clear from prostate cancer.

The Scots comedian, affectionately known as the Big Yin, announced the news during a live television interview ahead of Celtic’s Champions League match against Barcelona last night.

The 70-year-old star, who is an avid Celtic fan, travelled to Glasgow for the match from his home in New York.

He told Sky Sports News yesterday: ‘My health - I got the clearance on Wednesday on my cancer so I’m OK.’

Last month it was revealed that Connolly, 70, had undergone surgery for the condition and was receiving treatment for the initial stages of Parkinson’s disease.

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, second only to lung cancer in terms of how many it kills.

Around 40,000 men a year are diagnosed with the illness. Former chatshow host Sir Michael Parkinson has also been battling the illness.

The comedian’s announcement comes six weeks after it was revealed that Sir Michael is similarly expected to recover from the illness after completing a month of intensive radiotherapy.

Connolly  underwent an operation in the US which was described as ‘a total success’, but doctors spotted signs of the shaking disorder.

Parkinson’s affects 127,000 Britons and symptoms include tremors while the victim rests, rigidity of muscles, slowness of movement, unsteady balance and memory loss.

Connolly’s spokesman revealed that, despite the setback, the star will continue with his work commitments.

She said last month: ‘Billy has been assured by experts that the findings will in no way inhibit or affect his ability to work, and he will start filming a TV series in the near future, as well as undertaking an extensive theatrical tour of New Zealand in the new year.’

Fans were concerned earlier this year when Connolly admitted he had started to forget his lines during performances.

A show at the Waterfront Hall in Belfast in April was marred by forgetful moments where he asked the audience what he was talking about.
