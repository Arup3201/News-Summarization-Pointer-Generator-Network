A former Miami Dolphins player who fell off a fishing boat has survived after swimming nine miles to shore.

Robert Konrad, who played for the NFL between 1999 and 2004, was fishing alone off the coast of Palm Beach, Florida on Wednesday night and trying to land a catch when he fell into the water.

His 36-foot boat was on autopilot and drifted away from him, leaving him stranded.

When he failed to return home, friends contacted authorities and the Coast Guard deployed a helicopter to search for him, but came up with nothing.

Meanwhile, Konrad started swimming to shore through the night - spending a staggering 12 hours in the water. 

He eventually hit land at 1800 South Ocean Boulevard in Palm Beach at around 4.40am on Thursday, wearing nothing but his underpants, and managed to flag down a passing cop, WPBF reported.

At the time, the Coast Guard had been preparing for another search but received a call from the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office to say Konrad had been found. 

It is believed he was in the water for between 10 and 12 hours and swam approximately nine miles, according to the Coast Guard. For comparison, marathon swims are defined as 6.2 miles.

On Wednesday afternoon, shore temperatures in Palm Beach were 61F (16C) and dropped to 55F (12.8C) overnight. 

The former fullback told police that he had seen the lights of the Coast Guard helicopter overhead as he swam towards shore, but the crew had not spotted him, WPBF reported.

Konrad, 38, was taken to hospital and treated for hypothermia but has now been released.

He told local media he did not wish to speak about the incident.

A Coast Guard spokesman told Local 10 News that Konrad's boat was last seen headed in the direction of the Bahamas and has not been recovered.

Konrad, who was a second-round draft pick, stopped playing with the Dolphins in 2004 and was briefly with the Oakland Raiders before leaving football and working for investment firms. 

According to his firm's website, he is president and CEO of Alterna Capital, Alterna Wealth Management, and Executive Vice President for Alterna Capital Funding.

He now lives in Boynton Beach with his wife Tammy, according to property records.
