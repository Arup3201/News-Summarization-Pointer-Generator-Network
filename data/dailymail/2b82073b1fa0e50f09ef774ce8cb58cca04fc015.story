Nicolas Sarkozy’s most senior aide regularly mocked him as a ‘dwarfish Napoleon’, an ‘airhead’ and a ‘nutter’, it was claimed last night.

The revelations will come as a huge blow to the former French president, 60, who is aiming for re-election in two years.

Adviser Patrick Buisson, 65, was credited with steering Mr Sarkozy into the Elysee Palace, where he served between 2007 and 2012.

But a book called The Bad Genie claims Mr Buisson frequently mocked the 5ft 5in politician, who wore stacked heels, especially when with his third wife, former supermodel Carla Bruni. 

Mr Buisson, who is an expert on opinion polls, said Mr Sarkozy could 'do nothing without me' and would call him all the time.

'It was the Dwarf' or 'the Little One', Mr Buisson would tell colleagues after receiving a call from Mr Sarkozy.

Mr Buisson was viewed as a 'compass' and 'genius' by Mr Sarkozy, despite also being referred to as a 'nutter' or 'airhead'.

Mr Buisson would not think twice about slamming the phone down on Mr Sarkozy, saying: 'I'm having lunch, you're bothering me'.

He would also put Mr Sarkozy's voice on speaker, and laugh about him with friends, saying: 'He can do nothing without me, Naboleon'.

The nickname was a cross between 'Napoleon' - the legendary French leader - and the term 'nabot', which means dwarfish.

Authors Ariane Chemin and Vanessa Schneider, who both write for Le Monde, said Sarkozy would phone Mr Buisson for 'reassurance' more than his wives.

Mr Buisson fell out with Mr Sarkozy last year, after it emerged that he had recorded many of their conversations without the politician's consent.

In one, Carla Bruni dubs her husband a 'kept man', thanks to her fortune amassed during her time as a model in the 1990s.

Mr Sarkozy went on to sue his former mentor for around 70,000 pounds, saying: 'In my life I've known betrayal, but rarely one like this.'

Mr Sarkozy was defeated by Francois Hollande, his detested Socialist rival, in 2012 after just one term in office.

The conservative leader of the UMP Party is determined to get back into power, but is facing a range of corruption enquiries.

They include claims that he received millions in back handers from former Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi. Mr Sarkozy denies any wrongdoing.
