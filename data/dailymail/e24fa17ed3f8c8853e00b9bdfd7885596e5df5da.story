Shocking footage has emerged online of a man hurling  racial abuse at two Muslim men on a bus.

The video shows two young passengers, who appeared to be Middle Eastern, grabbing their backpacks and  luggage as they made their way off a bus in Naenae in Lower Hutt, New Zealand.

An old man can be heard screaming obscenities, saying 'Islam c****, that's where you fellas (sic) from - go back to your country' and accusing them of 'shooting innocent people'.

But a female passenger named Pene Walker who intervened, has been hailed a hero after she was heard defending the two men on Wednesday as she yelled 'doesn't matter who killed who'.

Shocking footage has emerged online of a man hurling racial abuse at two Muslim men on a bus

The 60-year-old mother of two, from Lower Hutt, told Daily Mail Australia the rant had started for more than half an hour on the bus before she stepped in.

'I ignored it for a good half an hour,' Ms Walker said.

'The guys didn't know their way around the area so another lady and I tried to direct them to their destination but then they started to get abused by that man.

'I don't see myself as a hero. I just needed to stand up for myself and the guys because of what he said. He also abused me and called me names.'

In the video, Ms Walker is heard speaking back at the old man, telling him to 'behave'.

But the man, who was donning a white cowboy hat, started abusing Ms Walker after the two men got off at their stop.

'Shut your mouth up. Get f***,' the man said to Ms Walker, who was sitting a couple of rows in front.

Ms Walker then turns around and says 'excuse me' before the man continues to verbally abuse her.

'Come on then - I'll take your back,' the man said.

'F*** turn around, turn around. Shut your mouth up b****.'

Another female passenger, who recorded the video and uploaded it to Facebook, told 3 News she was impressed to see Ms Walker defend the two male passengers.

'Who are you to tell anyone to go back to your country?' the woman who is known as 'Noor' wrote.

'New Zealand don't need people like you here (sic). People like this need to grow up and [get] a life - we don't want anything like that here.'

NZ Bus has apologised to the passengers who were abused and are currently investigating the incident

NZ Bus has apologised to the passengers who were abused but hit back at people who have claimed the bus driver didn't intervene or 'kick the abusive man off the bus'.

'If they step into a situation like that and confront the passenger it could potentially escalate the situation and that puts themselves and their passengers at risk,' NZ Bus' chief operating officer Tonia Haskell said.

It is unknown as to what happened after the video stopped recording but Ms Walker claims she has reported the incident to police and NZ Bus will be investigating the incident.
