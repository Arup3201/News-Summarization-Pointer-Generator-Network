This clip shows the moment a group of Canadian gangsters perform a daring prison break using a helicopter that landed in the jail yard. 

Yves Denis, Denis Lefebvre, and Serge Pomerleau, escaped the Quebec prison in June this year but were found two weeks later in a fancy 10th-floor condo in the Old Port district of Montreal.

The surveillance clip was released by a Quebec Superior Court after it was shown in court this week.

The clip begins with two of the inmates visible inside the yard of the Orsainville Detention Centre in Quebec

The bold escape occurred at 7.45pm on June 7 this year and led to an international manhunt

A few seconds later, the green helicopter is partly visible as it takes off. 

The brazen but well-planned escape, happened at 7.45pm on June 7 and led to an international manhunt.

Quebec's Public Security Ministry announced no-fly zones over three detention facilities in the province as an increased security measure.

Four days later, there were no signs of the fugitives, leading to Interpol issuing an Orange Notice, or an international alert, to all of its 190 member countries to help track down the men. 

And after more than two weeks on the run, a heavily-armed SWAT team raided an upscale condominium and captured the men on June 22.

At the time, Quebec police Sergeant Audrey-Anne Bilodeau said: 'It could be a person who helped them escape from prison or a person who helped them hide from us,.

The three men were originally arrested as part of Operation Crayfish in 2010, which dismantled a network of drug traffickers. 

The escape took place while the three men were on trial.

They were found guilty of drug trafficking, conspiracy and gangsterism.

But now, they face another trial on charges of jailbreak and escaping legal custody.
