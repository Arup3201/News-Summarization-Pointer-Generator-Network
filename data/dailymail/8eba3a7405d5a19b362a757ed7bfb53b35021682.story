A Chinese man was left stunned after he went to the doctor experiencing stomach aches and blood in his urine – only to discover that he was a woman on his period.

The married 44-year-old man from Zhejiang province, China, visited his local doctor with his wife in Yongkang where he made the shocking discovery that he had, all along, in fact been a woman.

After a full examination, doctors discovered that he had a full set of female reproductive organs along with a penis - which he said had given him an active sex life with his wife of ten years.

PMT: Doctors told him that his stomach ache was actually his monthly period

But doctors doubted this.

Doctors found that his genitals were different from other men and he did not possess an Adam’s apple.

A spokesman for First People’s Hospital of Yongkang said that doctors doubted that Mr Chen was a female at first.

He said: ‘He was wearing men's clothes with short hair, so we didn’t think that he would be a female at the beginning’.

However, Mr Chen said that he had known that something was wrong with him after he found himself constantly feeling fatigued with swollen face and legs.

Even worse, he constantly found blood in his urine.

A CT scan soon revealed that he had a uterus and ovaries.

Meanwhile, a chromosome examination showed that Mr Chen had a pair of XX sex chromosomes, making him genetically female.

The
 condition of being 'Intersex' affects one in every 2,000 births in the 
UK (although figures may be much higher) and there are an estimated 
30,000 intersex people in the UK.

There are several known abnormalities that can lead to specific sexual ambiguity.

So called 'XX male syndrome' occurs
 in people who have two X chromosomes - one of which contains a 
significant amount of genetic material from a Y chromosome.

These people appear to be male, but
 are, in fact, genetically female. Typically, they will possess male sex
 organs, but these will often be underdeveloped.

They will also often develop breasts and maintain a high-pitched speaking voice.

In fact, biologists now recognise a
 host of conditions, both genetic and otherwise, which are labelled 
under the umbrella term 'intersex' - which replaces older terms such as 
'hermaphrodite'.

Intersex people may be genetically 
female, but physiologically male. Some will be true hermaphrodites, 
producing both eggs and sperm.

Mr Chen was also suffering from Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia, a genetic disease that causes the adrenal glands to swell due to a decrease in stress hormone and an increase in male sex hormones.

A lump was later surgically removed from his adrenal glands. 

This type of medical case is extremely rare and doctors have not confirmed whether Mr Chen was a hermaphrodite or intersex. But he did appear to have two types of genitalia.

Doctors said it was too late for Mr Chen to seek medical treatment for his unusual problem as it was only effective for younger people.
