Linked arm-in-arm, Paula Broadwell and her husband Scott were seen together yesterday evening for the first time since the news broke of her affair with shamed former CIA Director David Petraeus.

Arriving at her brother's home in the Mount Pleasant suburb of Washington D.C. in a black SUV, the two put on what was a clear show of solidarity as they marched from the garage to the back door of the $2.3 million property.

Since the scandalous revelations surrounding his wife first surfaced just over a week ago, Scott Broadwell has been conspicuous for his absence and his appearance last night indicates that he is standing by the West Point Graduate.

Looking stern and taking the lead from her husband, the Paula Broadwell did not speak to the gathered news reporters as she marched into her sibling's home.

Presumably, the pair had been out that evening, possibly at dinner and it is not clear when Scott arrived at the home or when Paula herself left.

Indeed, this is the first time that Paula has been seen since Tuesday evening, when she was photographed wearing a hot pink top in the kitchen of her brother's home.

She has been holed up there since returning from what was supposed to be a romantic get-away with Scott to celebrate her 40th birthday - which was curtailed when news of the Petraeus affair broke over one week ago.

Paula Broadwell and her husband Scott parked their car in the garage at her brother's Washington D.C. home and then entered in through the back yard entrance

Friends and family of the pair told 
reporters in the wake of the affair revelations that the Broadwell's had
built a happy home in Charlotte, North Carolina, where they live with 
their two sons, Lucien 6, and Landon, 4.

The radiologist works at a hospital 
in the southern city and the 43-year-old and his wife  'love 
to do Crossfit, run, ski and surf together.' according to a biography of Paula Broadwell published by the University of Denver,

In
January, while promoting her now fated biography of David Petraeus, 
Paula Broadwell told the Charlotte Observer that she met Scott in 
Germany and described them both as 'adventure junkies.'

At
an alumni event for the University of Denver in October, Broadwell said
it was 'very difficult to start a family' when the two of them were on 
active duty.

'We had decided before we got married that every other move would be the other person’s choice, since we are both very career-oriented,' said Paula Broadwell at the event. according to the Daily Beast

'And he chose Colorado, he chose Denver.'

They moved into their $800,000 two-story brick home in Charlotte's Dilworth suburb in 2009 and Scott became an employee of Charlotte Radiology at the same time.

In the January interview with the Charlotte Observer Broadwell said that when she was abroad with Petraeus in Afghanistan, Scott and her mother took care of their two sons.

Scott Broadwell and his wife have also been involved in a number of groups that work to benefit veterans of the armed forces.

Since the affair broke, their home has been empty and visible on the driveway is power-washed writing, which reads in a flourishing font: ‘Dad loves Mom.’

Paula Broadwell's affair with 
Petraeus was exposed after she sent a series of messages to Florida 
socialite Jill Kelly, apparently warning her off her lover.

The messages, which have been described as 'kind of cat-fight stuff',  had been sent anonymously to an account shared by Mrs Kelley and her husband, but FBI investigators traced them to Broadwell.

In one of the 
emails from Broadwell to Kelley, she accused the Florida housewife of touching 'him' underneath a table 
and another email asked if Kelley's husband was aware of her actions, 
according to the Wall Street Journal.

In another, the biographer of the 
former CIA director was apparently aggressive towards Mrs Kelley, 
saying: 'Who do you think you are?'

She also accused the socialite, a 
Petraeus family friend, of 'parad[ing] around the base', adding: 'You 
need to take it down a notch.'

Kelley has denied being any more than
friends with Petraeus and released a statement saying: 'We and our 
family have been friends with Gen. Petraeus for over five years.

'We respect his family’s privacy and want the same for us and our three children.'

It
also emerged today that Broadwell sent an email anonymously to General 
John Allen, who has been accused of swapping thousands of 
'inappropriate' emails with Kelley. It was traced back to Petraeus' 
mistress and he discussed it with Kelley, it is claimed.

In fact the bombshell of the illict 
affair that rocked the nation broke when Broadwell and her husband Scott
were enjoying a two-day break at the Middleton Inn in Little 
Washington, Virginia.

Sources told the Washingtonian.com 
that the couple had enjoyed 'strenuous' bike rides, champagne and cozy 
dinners since arriving at the luxury inn last Thursday evening - the day
before the scandal hit the news.

According
to sources, Dr Broadwell, a radiologist, had arranged for Champagne and
a bouquet of roses for his wife's milestone birthday.

The
couple reportedly joined other guests at the Inn for breakfast - but by
the time they returned from a romantic dinner last Friday evening, they
were described to the magazine as 'not being in very good moods'.

They
left abruptly last Saturday morning and were allegedly on their way to 
D.C. A party had also been planned for Mrs Broadwell's birthday on 
Saturday night - but it was cancelled.
