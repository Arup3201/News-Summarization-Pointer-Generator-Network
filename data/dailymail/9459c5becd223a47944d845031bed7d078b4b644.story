He's back!

Disgraced ex-Congressman Anthony Weiner is once again trolling around on Twitter — the same social media platform where he destroyed his political career.

This time, the married father chose as a 'favorite' pic a shot of a scantily-clad woman who goes by the name of Joslyn Stevens , of 'SugarFuzz' on Twitter, Gawker reported.

On the microblogging site, Stevens' bio reads: 'Filling in for your wife since 2001. Indulge your sexual fantasies by having an affair.'

Oops: Anthony Weiner didn't learn much from the sexting scandal that cost his political career. He's once again perusing attractive young women's Twitter accounts and publicly marking their pictures as 'favorites'

Target: Joslyn Stevens is the woman whose picture Weiner favorited on Twitter

The married Weiner in 2011 was caught in a sexting scandal that forced him to resign from Congress.

Then he went on to launch a failed bid for mayor of New York City last year — while he was still sexting with women.

His most notable sexting partner, Sydney Leathers, has gone on to become a porn actress and once bragged about exchanging dates and sexual acts with sugar daddies for money, MailOnline reported exclusively.  

Last week, Weiner told Politico his 'political career is probably over' but wouldn't say if he still exchanges saucy messages with women.

His wife, Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, has stood by his side. 

This is not the first this happens. Weiner once favorited a a tweet declaring 'Tinder will now be the ultimate sext machine.'

And he once favorited sexy photos of a California woman who went by the name of 'ParisDylan550' on Twitter.

Back then, Weiner said: 'There were a bunch of favorites there that I either didn't recognize or mean to favorite.

'I'm not clear on how they got marked in the first place but I assume I hit the little star thing accidentally as I scrolled through stuff.'

The favorite has since been removed from Weiner's Twitter account.

Stevens seems to be enjoying her five minutes of fame.

'I’m not upset but I do love weiners,' she tweeted about being dragged into the media spotlight.
