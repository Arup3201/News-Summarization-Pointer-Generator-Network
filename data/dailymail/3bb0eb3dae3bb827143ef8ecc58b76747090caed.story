Gordon Brown was locked in an extraordinary war of words with News International last night.

In an unprecedented attack by a former prime minister on a leading business, Mr Brown claimed Rupert Murdoch’s media group has ‘links with the criminal underworld’ and accused it of using ‘disgusting’ methods to gain access to personal information.

He said he and wife Sarah had been left ‘in tears’ when Rebekah Brooks, then editor of The Sun, contacted them to tell them she was going to publish a story about his son Fraser’s diagnosis with cystic fibrosis.

However, The Sun last night claimed that
there had been no wrong-doing and that the story came to them through a
good old-fashioned method - a tip-off from a member of the public.

Mr Brown also claimed his bank accounts and legal files had been accessed by investigators working for the Sunday Times. 

The former Prime Minister said: ‘News International were using people who were known criminals,’ he said. ‘People who had in some cases criminal records, and... News International as a result were working through links that they had with the criminal underworld.’

But News International hit back last night, categorically denying allegations that The Sun had accessed medical records.

It also claimed Mr Brown and his wife Sarah gave senior staff at the paper consent to publish the November 2006 article.

A spokesman for the firm said: ‘We are able to assure the Brown family that we did not access the medical records of their son, nor did we commission anyone to do so.

'On receipt of the information, The Sun approached Mr Brown and discussed with his colleagues how best to present it.

'Those colleagues provided quotes which were used in the published piece which indicated his consent to it.

'We continue to inquire into other allegations made by Mr Brown.'

In an article published today in The Sun, the unnamed member of the public said he contacted reporters with information about Fraser's cystic fibrosis in an attempt to raise awareness about the condition.

He said: 'I felt vindicated in contacting The Sun. I just felt at the time that we could have made something positive out of the tragedy and I believe the truth would have come out eventually anyway.

'It is tragic for the Browns like 
many other people throughout the years who have children diagnosed. But 
the fact that they are so high profile could have made a difference.'

The father, who is said to have links
with the Brown family, learned about Fraser's condition just weeks 
after he was born, the paper said.

However, he did not immediately pass on the news because he expected it to be widely reported.

'I was very surprised it didn't come 
out before it did," he added. 'I did it with the best of intentions and I
totally stand by that decision.

'I have no regrets. I just wanted to 
highlight this. It's happened to many people and it's just sad that it's
happening to another family. A very high profile family.'

The source also said he did not have access to the Brown family medical records.

'I have not had access to the medical records of the child at any time,' he said.

The Sunday Times also denied Mr Brown’s claims, insisting it had investigated a story about his purchase of a flat, which it published in January 2000, in the public interest. 

‘We were told that Mr Brown had bought a flat cheaper than any normal valuation and that he obtained it through a company in which Geoffrey Robinson, a close ally, had been a director,’ the newspaper said in a statement.

A convicted conman, Barry Beardall, is said to have been commissioned by the paper to ‘blag’ information on the apartment.

But the statement said: ‘We had reasonable grounds to investigate this matter and followed the PCC Code on using subterfuge.

‘We believe no law was broken in the process of this investigation, and contrary to Mr Brown’s assertion, no criminal was used.’
