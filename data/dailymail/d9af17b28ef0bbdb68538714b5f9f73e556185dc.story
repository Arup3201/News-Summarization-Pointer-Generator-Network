A homeowner has been denied home insurance because of a flood risk despite living 250ft above sea on a hillside. 

Eric Brisley, 85, whose home overlooks North Sands beach in scenic Salcombe, Devon, couldn’t believe it when Lloyds told him it was too risky to insure his home.

The retired ICI worker said it would be impossible for his home to flood because of its height and distance of 750ft from the sea.

But the company which assesses risk on a postcode basis said all houses in his postcode are a flood risk and has placed a blanket ban on insuring them.

Mr Brisley, a grandfather of three has lived at the house for 30 years and is already insured with another firm.

But after an unrelated appointment at Lloyds Bank in Kingsbridge, he was offered a quote for insurance on his home.

He said: 'I was quite happy with my present insurer but the assistant said she thought she could do better.

'She put in my particulars into the computer and began to look very worried.

'And went off to make a phone call.

'When she came back she said there was something wrong with the system and would phone me when she had sorted it out.

'But she phoned me to say unfortunately as my house was liable to flooding she couldn’t insure me.

'I was absolutely astonished because I live 250ft above sea level and 750ft from the water - it’s quite ridiculous.

'There’s no possibility of getting flooded either from streams or from the sea.

'I don’t think even the biggest tsunami would affect us up here.

'Most of England would be flooded before I get flooded.'

Despite sending letters and maps indicating his home was unlikely to flood, Lloyds and its underwriters would still not give him insurance.

Mr Brisley is worried the refusal by Lloyds could affect his future premiums as he will now have to declare he was denied insurance.

Kimberly Hamilton, media relations manager at Lloyds Bank, said: 'This particular postcode is coastal and on a very significant slope, part of which is high flood risk, hence why we decline to underwrite in that area.'

However, Mr Brisley said: 'The whole post code area TQ8 8JP has never been flooded.

'The system of assessment, which Lloyds use is seriously flawed.

'There is nothing unusual or unique about our situation and so it follows that there are likely to be many thousands of homes around our coasts which are incorrectly being denied cover.

Ms Hamilton added: 'Unfortunately, at present, our systems are only able to underwrite at a postcode level, which occasionally can mean situations such as Mr Brisley’s arise.

'However, we are currently working towards a system that will allow us to underwrite based on an individual house level, which will prevent these issues from arising.'
