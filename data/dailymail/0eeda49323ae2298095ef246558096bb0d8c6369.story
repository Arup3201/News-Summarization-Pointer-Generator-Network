Andrew Strauss has called for an end to all the mud-slinging and ‘madness’ that has been ignited this week in the wake of Kevin Pietersen releasing his autobiography.

The former captain believes damage is being done to the national side as scores are settled and major figures in the game line up on one side or the other supporting or condemning the controversial batsman.

Strauss wants to see a period of calm. ‘A lot of this going on at the moment is madness,’ the former England skipper told Sky Sports.

‘The victim here isn’t Kevin Pietersen or (Andy) Flower or (Matt) Prior; it’s actually the England cricket team and Alastair Cook and Peter Moores, who have got to try to take the side forward. That to me is the disappointing thing about this whole episode.

‘There has been a lot of rumour, innuendo and opinion. I prefer to stick with the facts. All this tit-for-tat stuff, I don’t think it helps the England team.’

Strauss acknowledged that Pietersen could be proud of playing some of England’s ‘most memorable innings’ and described him as one of the country’s ‘finest players’.

Yet he also defended Prior and Flower, the two men who had scorn and vitriol poured upon them in the book, which went on sale yesterday.

‘Matt had a massive impact on the team, with the bat and behind the scenes — he was the embodiment of a culture we were trying to produce of putting the team first. Andy Flower is a guy of complete integrity. 

'He’s achieved phenomenal things, and should be regarded as one of England’s great coaches. The idea the team comes first was central to what we did, and something he was very conscious and protective of.’ 

Pietersen's book has caused considerable controversy, with the former batsman pulling no punches 

England bowler James Anderson, when asked about Pietersen’s allegations, said: ‘It’s just sad that what was a successful period for England has now been overshadowed by what has come out. 

‘What I remember about the time Kevin is talking about is that this was one of the most successful periods English cricket has ever had and that comes down to Andy Flower and the guys in the dressing room at the time. 

'We won three Ashes, including winning them away from home for the first time in 24 years, and we beat India and became No 1 in the world, so what is being talked about here are many of the highlights of my career. 

Bowler James Anderson has said that the story is taking away from England's impressive record  

Speaking at a Hardys wine event at Lord’s, Anderson added: ‘I have really fond memories of this time, like sitting on the outfield at Sydney with all the guys, when we beat Australia 3-1.

‘Sharing that moment with Kevin and everybody is something I will cherish for the rest of my life.

‘To be overshadowed by this is unfair on Andy because you can’t argue with what he achieved as a coach.

‘Hopefully what has happened this week will not be remembered as much as all the memories we all cherish.’ 

Former South Africa captain Graeme Smith (R) claims there is some truth in Pietersen's comments 

Former South Africa skipper Graeme Smith also weighed in, adding: ‘Some of the stuff (Pietersen) touches on in his book I certainly believe.

‘Having played against them, we always used to say if we could get a win or get ahead they would turn on each other.

‘The bullying stuff you did experience when you played against them, and you knew you could use it as an asset to get on their other side.’
