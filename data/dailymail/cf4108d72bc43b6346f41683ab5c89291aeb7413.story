Multiple people are claiming that Ray Rice told NFL commissioner Roger Goodell that he punched his then fiancée in a meeting back in June.

Four sources close to Rice say that during a disciplinary meeting in the commissioner's office on June 16, Rice told Goodell he had hit Janay Rice, his now-wife, in the face inside a Revel Casino Hotel elevator in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and knocked her unconscious.

This contradicts a statement made by Goodell that Rice was 'ambiguous' about what happened when the two spoke earlier this year.

Who's telling the truth?: Multiple sources claim Ray Rice told NFL commissioner Roger Goodell that he punched his then fiancée in a meeting back in June

Not forthright: Goodell has claimed that rice (above, with wife Janay) was 'ambiguous' about what happened

The news comes hot on the heels of conflicting reports about when Goodell first saw video of the incident.

Goodell claims he did not see it until earlier this week, while a law enforcement official has possibly contradicted that statement by playing  a 12-second voicemail from an NFL office number on April 9 confirming the video had arrived for them to view.

A female voice expresses thanks and says: 'You're right. It's terrible.' 

The message was played for the Associated Press on Wenesday.

'Ray didn't lie to the commissioner,' a source with knowledge of the meeting told Outside the Lines. 

'He told the full truth to Goodell -- he made it clear he had hit her, and he told Goodell he was sorry and that it wouldn't happen again.'

Added another source, who echoed that Rice was honest with the commissioner, 'This is a public lynching of Ray.'

'There was no ambiguity about what happened [in the elevator],' said a third source.

A fourth source also confirmed all these statements.

Sacked: Rice was terminated by the Baltimore Ravens on Monday, and has been suspended indefinitely by the NFL

Investigating: Goodell announced former FBI director Robert S Mueller III will conduct a probe into how the league pursued and handled evidence

Goodell has yet to respond to this current accusation.

On Wednesday, he announced former FBI director Robert S Mueller III will conduct a probe into how the league pursued and handled evidence as it investigated claims against Rice.

There is also one other person with knowledge of the meeting who backs up Goodell's claim, and says that Rice implied that he only 'slapped' Janay. 

NFL spokesman Greg Aiello declined to comment Thursday afternoon. 

Rice, whose contract with the Baltimore Ravens was terminated on Monday, remains indefinitely suspended from the NFL. 

He is expected to challenge that decision this Monday.
