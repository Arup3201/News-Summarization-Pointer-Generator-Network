It appears the Government's key Budget plank of a $7 GP co-payment is dead in the water, or at least, that's what Clive Palmer believes.

'We’re not going to have a co-payment of even one cent,' Mr Palmer said.

'There’ll be none. Isn’t that good?'

This news came as a hammer blow for the Government, which was still talking up a possible deal as latest as this morning. 

'All of Australians don’t need to worry any more,' said the billionaire MP.

'The co-payment is dead. We won’t be supporting it. It’s over, finished.'

The co-payment is dead. Billionaire MP Clive Palmer has delivered the bad Budget news to the Government today that 'we are not going to have a co-payment of even one cent'

Tony Abbott was still talking up a deal on the Medicare co-payment plan as late as this morning 'that is what we're working towards'. That was until Clive Palmer arrived to tell the Coalition that 'the co-payment is dead, we won't be supporting it'

Mr Palmer continued, suggesting the co-payment had now been consigned to history.

'You can talk to all the analysts and crunch all the numbers you want but the fact of the matter is the Palmer United Senators will not be changing their position and the co-payment will not be getting through.

'We have been inundated with calls from real Australians and the message is very clear that they do not want it.

'It is another cost they simply can’t afford and the Palmer United Party cannot allow more pain to be inflicted on ordinary Australians who are already doing it tough under Tony Abbott.

'Low income earners, single parent families, pensioners, nursing home patients and those who are socially or financially disadvantaged will be hardest hit by a GP co-payment.

'It is a ruthless attack on Australians when savings can be made elsewhere in the budget.

“There is zero chance of the Palmer United Party supporting it in the Senate,” Mr Palmer added.

Mr Palmer has long lobbied for co-payment provisions to be altered, particularly for pensioners.

Last week Mr Abbott repeated the Coalition's stance though.

'We don’t exempt pensioners from a PBS co-payment. Their co-payment is normally a little less than the co-payment that the public faces,' he said.

'I don't think it's unreasonable for a comparable amount to be paid for visits to the GP.'

The proposal announced in the May Budget deemed that all patients would pay a $7 fee, but concession card holders and children would be bulk-billed after paying the fee 10 times in a year.

Today, Mr Abbott remained confident the co-payment would get through.

'We certainly think it should, this is what we’re working towards,' he said.

But without support from PUP, the Government will be hard pressed to breathe life back into the co-payment plan which was a major chunk of the $10.5 billion cut to health spending. 

The Medicare plan alone was forecast to save $3.5 billion over four years.
