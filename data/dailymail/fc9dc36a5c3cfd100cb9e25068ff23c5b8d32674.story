Superstar Katy Perry's preacher dad - who once called her a 'devil child' - has revealed he will be in the Super Bowl crowd on Sunday to cheer her on.

Firebrand evangelical minister Keith Hudson declared the I Kissed A Girl singer, best known for her racy costumes and outlandish performances, was in dire need of ‘healing’.

However when Daily Mail Online caught up with him at his church headquarters in Orange County, California, Mr Hudson revealed his views have mellowed - and said he can't wait to watch her in the Super Bowl halftime show.

He said: 'Oh no, I don't have a problem. She's gonna do some good ones - she's excited.'

Heading to the SuperBowl: Fiery preacher Keith Hudson, the father of superstar Katy Perry, outside his Orange County church HQ on Monday

'I don't watch football!' Keith Hudson says he doesn't follow football - but will be in the crowd to cheer on his daughter as she stars in the halftime show on Sunday

Katy, 30, will perform in the Pepsi Super Bowl XLIX Halftime Show, which is the most-watched musical event of the year.

More than 115 million viewers in the U.S. watched last year's show, which is also will be broadcast worldwide.

And the star's dad said he is looking forward to attending the clash between the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots in Phoenix, Arizona.

But he made it clear he's only going to Arizona for Katy - admitting: 'I don't watch football, I just hope somebody wins at the Super Bowl!' 

However, the preacher said that Katy may be toning things down for the NFL, as when asked if she would be her usual provocative self, he exclaimed 'No!'  

Katy, who will be joined by singer Lenny Kravitz on stage, has made it no secret that she can't wait for Sunday.

She even posted a picture of her toes painted with footballs, with the message: 'Even my tippy toes are ready.' 

Mr Hudson, 67, a reformed 1960s hippy who has dedicated the last forty or so years to spreading the Gospel - was dressed in a black t-shirt and pants with a huge pendant around his neck, a Christian cross ring on his finger, two silver chains on his wrist and blue sneakers

And confirming he’s proud his daughter landed the coveted half-time show gig at America’s biggest sporting showdown taking place in Phoenix this year, he said: ‘I’m always proud. I’m a proud father.’

However, he refused to be drawn on his daughter’s rumored reconciliation with her ex-boyfriend John Mayer, saying: ‘No questions on John Mayer.’

But when asked if he knew if they were back together, he said: ‘I don't know, you know more than I know.’ 

It is all a far cry from Mr Hudson's previous sentiments towards his famous daughter. 

Two years ago, he reportedly told a congregation in Santa Fe Springs, California, of his disapproval of his daughter, saying: ‘They ask how can I preach if I produce a girl who sang about kissing another girl?

‘I was at a concert of Katy’s where there were 20,000. I’m watching this generation and they were going at it. It almost looked like church. I stood there and wept and kept on weeping and weeping. They’re loving and worshiping the wrong thing.’ 

Back together? Katy Pery and her on-off lover, singer John Mayer, were spotted together in Beverly Hills, California, earlier this month

Mr Hudson is married to Katy’s mom Mary and the pair travel to different churches preaching the gospel and claiming to perform spiritual healings on churchgoers.

The pair both led a bohemian counterculture life in the 1960s before turning to religion – with Mary even dating rock legend Jimi Hendrix.

Katy told Katie Couric: ‘My mum went on a date with Jimi Hendrix. My dad was a part of Strawberry Fields Forever and hung out with Timothy Leary.

The gospel according to Hudson: Keith Hudson and his wife Mary are both preachers at their Orange County HQ

'And they found God. They needed to find God. Not that they needed to find God, but God found them, really.

'My parents have stories. They probably have better stories than I do.’

However Mary has previously said she 'hates' I Kissed A Girl as it 'promotes homosexuality and its message is shameful and disgusting'.
