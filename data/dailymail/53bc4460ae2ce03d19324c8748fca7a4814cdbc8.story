Epic 80s rock anthem Livin’ On A Prayer has been catapulted back into the upper reaches of the singles chart thanks to a hilarious four-year-old clip of a guy mugging along to it at a Boston Celtics game.

Since its original release 26 years ago, the Bon Jovi tune has endured as a karaoke classic beloved by frustrated rock stars everywhere who can’t resist its cheesy charms.

Now in 2013 it is enjoying a renewed taste of chart success thanks to the power of the internet and the dancing skills of Jeremy Fry, a bespectacled basketball fan from Boston.

The viral success of a 2009 video of Boston Celtics fan Jeremy Fry dancing along to Bon Jovi's Livin' On A Prayer has catapulted the epic 80s rock anthem back into the charts at number 25

The clip of Fry has drawn 11 million worldwide views alone and has been shared on Facebook more than 1.6 million times since last month's posting on Utrend.tv

While attending a Celtics home game in 2009, Fry was so moved by the song’s tale of Tommy and Gina struggling to make ends meet that he burst into an impromptu piece of performance art that included air guitar poses, power grabs and a lot of physical contact with his fellow spectators. 

Fry really lives the song as he throws himself around the steps of Boston’s TD Garden in the name of rock and his energy is so infectious that other members of the crowd either join in or start laughing.

The hilarious footage of Fry was upload to Utrend.tv on October 17 and since then has become a viral sensation with people posting it onto social media platforms.

When Bon Jovi hit the number one spot in 1987 it was all thanks to physical sales of seven inch vinyl singles, but Billboard reports that it has stormed to number 25 on the Hot 100 this week ‘with 94 percent of its Hot 100 chart points owed to streaming.’

It also ‘sports an 11percent uptick to 4,000 downloads sold,' according to Nielsen SoundScan.

The iconic rock track also debuted on Streaming Songs at No. 5 after garnering 5.1 million streams in the U.S. last week (up 390%), according to Nielsen, almost all of the song's total streams (96percent) arrived from user-generated clips.

Prayer was actually released in late 1986, but didn’t top the charts until the following February when it stayed at the top for four weeks.

Jon Bon Bovi and his band-mates have enjoyed 25 Hot 100 hits, although this is their first taste of chart action since We Weren't Born To Follow in 2009
