One man has taken on the role of protecting Earth from world-ending asteroids from his home observatory in Wales.

While the sky-watching base might look more rural and less impressive then the vast shiny centres seen in Hollywood films, Jay Tate, 58, now has the UK’s only earthbound asteroid and comet tracking station.

Every night he spends hours scouring the skies with a two-tonne telescope, monitoring large space rocks hurtling towards Earth and keeps a direct line to Nasa free for emergencies.

Using a global list of known asteroids, Mr Tate observes their paths from his home observatory, which he shares with wife Anne in Knightood, Powys, Wales, while a series of robotic telescopes comb the sky for others.

A former Royal Artillery Soldier, Mr Tate has survived on his army pension for 15 years after taking up the armageddon-preventing position.

He paid for the expensive equipment, which he chose and installed so that he can track the space rocks, by using his own savings, money from his pension and donations from people backing the cause.

He said: 'It’s not exactly a glamorous job, being an unknown protector, but someone has to do it and we are absolutely more than happy to step up.

'Of course it would be nice if we got paid for it, as an army pension doesn’t pay much these days, but until then will we just keep on going.

'Since the country needs a centre like this and there is no one else to do it, we decided we would take it on.

'We have very good links with Nasa - they’re very much aware we’re the only eyes on the sky in Britain.'

From their detached village home, Mr and Mrs Tate operate the International Spaceguard Centre, after Leicester’s National Space Centre cut its project earlier this year.

After failing to secure a £360,000 grant to probe the solar system and beyond for asteroids, the undeterred pair continued to operate.

Each morning they wake up, carry out any necessary maintenance and admin duties and conduct public tours for amateur astronomers and schoolchildren in the afternoon.

Kevin Yates, exhibition development manager at the National Space Centre said the Leicester-based centre operated the NEO Information Centre (NEOIC) for 10 years under contract from the UK government, which included daily monitoring of the risk from newly discovered asteroids and comets.

'We produced regular reports to Government on specific NEOs [near Earth objects] that rated above zero on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale and issued a monthly close approach report,' he told MailOnline.

In 2012 the UK government took a decision to cease funding and the NEOIC at the National Space Centre closed.

A spokesman for the UK Space Agency said: 'Even the very modest funds to support this activity could not be justified against a backdrop of reduced government funding and a growing emphasis on space for delivering growth to the economy.'

Mr Yates said: 'We gave permission to Jay Tate at Spaceguard UK to use the name NEOIC.'

But when the sun goes down the dedicated duo turn their attention skywards.

Mr Tate said: 'Fortunately there are no known directly earthbound asteroids - that’s where we come in and help to identify if there are.

'We’re currently tracking a number that may eventually come close, while the telescopes will hunt for new ones.

'Everyone knows the sheer calamity of an asteroid striking the earth - from the extinction of dinosaurs to the 1,600 people injured during a small shower in Chelyabinsk, Russia, last year.'

The Spaceguard Centre won the Europlanet Prize for public engagement and planetary science this year.

They are currently in the process of 
installing a 24inch six-and-a-half tonne Smitt camera wide-field 
telescope so it can look for new hazards as well as track existing ones.

The telescope is currently in storage, while the money is raised for a dome to house it.

There
 is currently no UK Government funding for the trailing of asteroids and
 the couple are hoping to raise attention in the UK, rather than 
pursuing help across the pond.

Mr Tate said: 'In the UK there is absolutely no system set up; there is nobody to telephone.

Pictured with his two-tonne telescope, Mr Tate said it is about time that the UK plays a part in the global asteroid-watching project. he said the country has no capability to spot smaller objects but an asteroid 50 metres across could obliterate an area the size of greater London

'We deal directly with America and would have to do the same if we wanted to get the word out.

'The UK doesn’t play any part in the global project so it’s about time they did.

'We do not have the capability to spot smaller objects but something 50 metres across could completely take out an area the size of greater London.

'If something was heading towards us then a possible deflection mission could be mounted to stop it hitting the earth.

'But it would be up to the Americans as we couldn’t do anything about it here.'

Mr Tate uses a global list of known asteroids to decide which ones to pay close attention to. His Spaceguard Centre won the Europlanet Prize for public engagement and planetary science this year as he and his wife show schoolchildren and amateur astronomers their ambitious project

However, the picture is not too bleak.

A spokesman for the UK Space Agency told MailOnline that amateur astronomers such as Mr Tate are making 'significant discoveries.'

He said that even school children are playing their part as students at Reading School have recently installed a new observatory, which is being used to search for asteroids, among other celestial objects.

The school has been congratulated by Apollo 9 astronaut, Rusty Schweickart who spent over 10 days in space as a lunar pilot in 1969.

He said: 'I am very pleased to hear of this development and its potential use for detecting and tracking Near Earth Objects (NEOs).

Mr Tate, who is pictured here with a small telescope, said: 'We have very good links with NASA - they¿re very much aware we¿re the only eyes on the sky in Britain'

'This is an issue that my fellow astronauts and cosmonauts in the Association of Space Explorers consider of prime importance and we welcome the contribution that your facility might make.'

However, while volunteers are monitoring potential threats to life on Earth, there are no plans for an 'official' UK asteroid detection facility.

The UK Space Agency Spokesman said: 'The vast majority of UK funding for space is channeled through the European Space Agency (ESA).

'The European Space Agency does address NEOs on behalf on its Member States...as it recognises they are a global hazard, not unique to any country and that they require an international response.'

This is partly so countries can share the cost and because any solutions to asteroids on a collision course to earth require cohesive global action, he explained.

Speaking about Mr Tate's role, he said: 'I consider Jay a professional in the field and he has a unique and valuable contribution to make.

'Although he may not have followed the normal route, he is a gifted communicator, a very savvy operator and his previous academic engagement on the issue brought much-needed intellectual rigour to the problem when the nascent NEO programmes were being developed in the late 90's. He continues to act as a champion for the issue.'
