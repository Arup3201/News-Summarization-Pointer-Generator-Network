Donald Trump has fired a former billionaire divorcee from the vineyard she founded - a year after he snapped up her beloved property at a foreclosure auction.

Patricia Kluge became known as 'the wealthiest divorcee in history' after a $100 million settlement from media baron John Kluge in 1990 - but blew the fortune building a lavish estate and winery.

When the business struggled to get on its feet, Kluge was forced to declare bankruptcy in June 2011. Trump swooped in and shelled out $6.2 million for the 1,000-acre vineyard at an auction.

Kluge,  a longtime friend
of the Trumps, was given a role as a vice president of operations at the vineyard in Charlottesville, Virginia - but
has now been told she is no longer needed full time.

Kicked out: Donald Trump has fired bankrupt billionaire divorcee Patricia Kluge from the vineyard she founded. The pair are pictured at the vineyard's 2011 opening after Trump bought it at a foreclosure auction

The move comes even though the Trump Vineyard Estates - formerly known as the Kluge Estate Vineyard - has won awards for its wine while Kluge has worked on its team.

Trump, who famously yells the phrase 'You're fired!' at contestants on his show, The Apprentice, told Page Six: 'We gave her a transition contract for the first year, and that has ended.

'We are still working with her a little bit, and we still have a good relationship with Patricia. But it is never easy when you build something like that and you end up working for the people that are owning it.'

His son Eric, who runs the winery, said: 'Patricia's role was in operations, as we transitioned from a bank-owned property to a property that we owned.'

Not needed: Trump said Kluge, left, will no longer work for the winery full time but her husband Bill Moses, right, will continue to run the property as general manager

He added that she did 'a nice job' and that her current husband, Bill Moses, will continue to run the property as general manager.

Before the foreclosure, Trump paid $500,000 for 200 acres around the mansion. In an attempt to get his hands on the house, the deal included the front lawn and driveway.

But when Trump made a bid for the house, which had been up for sale for $100 million, for just $3.6 million at its foreclosure auction, the Bank of America refused and bought it back for $15.3 million.

He brought a lawsuit against the bank to
claim the property, which he wants to convert into a luxury hotel. The 
litigation is ongoing.

Up for grabs: Trump snapped up the land around Kluge's mansion and put in a bid for the lavish house

What's his: Trump said no one else will want the mansion as he own most of the land surrounding it

Site: Since taking over the winery in Virginia, the Trumps have turned it into an award-winning business

He has claimed no one else will want to buy the lavish 45-room neo-Georgian Albemarle House as he owns the front yard, most of the driveway and back yard.

'Maybe someone is stupid enough to buy the house,' Mr Trump told the Wall Street Journal last year. 'I wish them luck.'

Mrs Kluge, who is now married to her third husband, had owned the house since she 
acquired it as part of her bumper divorce from Metromedia billionaire John Kluge in 1990.

The house was designed after an 
18th-century English country manor with multilevel gardens, fountains, a
swimming pool and rustic guest cabin.

Old life: Kluge was a bellydancer, appeared in adult films and hosted extravagant parties at the mansion

Divorce: She became known as 'the wealthiest divorcee in history' after a $100 million settlement from her break up with media mogul John Kluge (pictured), once the richest man in the U.S.

It also has a spa, home theatre, 3,500-bottle wine cellar and 2,000-square-foot sitting room.

Mrs Kluge, who starred in adult film 'The 
Nine Acres of Nakedness', became known as the host of extravagant parties
attended by the rich and famous throughout the 1980s.

She hosted opulent 
events for royalty, corporate chieftains, celebrities and literary 
figures at the home, which Mrs Kluge once said defined her.
