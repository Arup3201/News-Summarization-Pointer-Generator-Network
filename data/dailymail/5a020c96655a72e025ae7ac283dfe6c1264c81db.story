Crushed to death: Shocked workers found Adrian Roberts trapped inside the machinery he had been cleaning

A labourer who worked in a slaughterhouse was crushed to death inside an industrial meat process machine he was cleaning, an inquest has heard. 

Adrian Roberts was killed instantly after a heavy hydraulic arm came down on top of him.

A coroner heard the 49-year-old may have broken Health and Safety rules by turning on the rotating machine, which separates the hind legs from cattle carcasses, to make it easier to wash.

Shocked co-workers found Mr Roberts trapped inside the machinery. 

He was discovered standing on a raised platform, with his torso bent inside the heavy-duty equipment.

The hydraulic arm of the machine had come down on top of him after he had leaned inside to scrub it down.

The labourer had worked at F Drury and Sons’ abattoir near Royal Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire, for one year before his death on August 18 2011.

His colleagues told an inquest in Salisbury that the machinery should have been turned off prior to cleaning and all electrical power cut to the machinery by two separate isolation switches at the slaughterhouse.

But Martin Ball, the firm's loading bay supervisor, told the inquest: 'He was slumped over the cage of the rise and fall platform.

'I shouted "what’s up Ades?" I got no reply and that’s when I went up to see what his problem was.'

His voice cracking with emotion, Mr Ball continued: 'I saw Ady trapped between the puller and the rise and fall platform.

'His hands were blue. I knew he was dead.

'I ran to the manager’s office to alert them and get them to call an ambulance.'

Mr Ball told the inquest it was common for the power supply to be turned back on to wash down machinery after a day’s slaughter - which is against safety guidelines.

'I know it goes on,' he said.

'It gets switched on, on the cleaning side of it afterwards on most days.

'It’s known by me, I don’t know if it’s known by other employees.'

Mr Ball claimed he didn’t know the machinery was supposed to be turned off while it was being cleaned.

'I didn’t know not to. It’s not my area of cleaning so I didn’t know what procedure they go through.'

Mr Ball also revealed Mr Roberts had reacted angrily when he was being teased by colleagues earlier on the day of his death.

'He had been taking a lot of banter during the day,' he said.

'Some of the blokes don’t know when to stop.

'There was a ping behind me. It was a knife hitting a metal post.

'Ady had thrown it down in a temper or something. He just left the building.'

Labourer Scott Sturgess, who trained Mr Roberts to clean the machinery, said it was policy to turn all the machines off while cleaning down the abattoir.

'I specifically did say no machines should be turned on, there should be no reason to power on any of the machines and he never questioned me about it,' said Mr Sturgess as he gave evidence to the inquest jury.

However, the coroner heard how some cleaners did routinely power up the equipment to wash it as it was turning because it was easier and quicker.

Polish worker Adam Bielenuki said he received training on the job from 'a friend' to turn the machines back on for cleaning.

'When I switched it on, I could wash the machinery a lot better,' he explained.

'You don’t need to switch it on but I switched it on because it was more comfortable for me and that was how my friend showed me to do it.'

The inquest heard that managers at the abattoir had changed safety procedures after the death, including locking access to the isolation switches which cut power to the heavy machinery.

A pathologist concluded that Mr Roberts, from Toothill, Swindon, died from asphyxiation due to chest compression.

The inquest continues.
