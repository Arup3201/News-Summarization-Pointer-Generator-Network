Killed in battle: Members of the Plantagenet Alliance are to launch an application for judicial review regarding the Ministry of Justice's decision to granted the University of Leicester a licence for King Richard III's burial

Distant family members of King Richard III, whose body was unearthed in a council car park, are set to challenge plans to bury the monarch - claiming they are a breach of human rights.

The Ministry of Justice granted archaeologists from the University of Leicester permission to decide where the body should be buried after their unexpected discovery of the Plantagenet king's body.

But the group of fifteen living relatives has objected to the plans and are expected to launch an application for judicial review of the MoJ's decision to grant the licence to the academics.

The debate over the king's final resting place has been propelled by the significant tourism boost that will inevitably be attached to the location.

Under a licence granted by the MoJ, the University of Leicester group decided that King Richard, who was killed at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, should be buried at Leicester Cathedral.

The Richard III Society - a partner of the university team with an interest in the monarch - has already developed plans for a tomb inside the building.

But the campaigners have argued that Richard III would have wanted a burial in York Minster cathedral.

An application for judicial review is to be lodged by lawyers on behalf of the family group, known as the Plantagenet Alliance.

The family will argue that the MoJ failed to consult them over the terms of the burial licence, claiming that this was a breach of the right to family life under article 8 of the European Convention on 
Human Rights.

A petition calling for King Richard to be re-interred in York has been signed by more than 23,000 people, while a similar petition backing a Leicester burial has attracted below 8,000 signatures.

Final resting place: The remains are expected to be interred in Leicester Cathedral in May next year, with a large memorial service

Alternative: The Plantagenet Alliance argue that the remains should be buried in York Minster cathedral

Tomb: The Richard III Society, which was behind the excavation along with the University of Leicester team, has proposed a simple tomb

An exhibition centre has been earmarked by Leicester City Council for a Victorian building  overlooking the car park where the king's body was unceremoniously buried after being killed by Henry VII's troops.

After his naked body was brought back battle on the back of a horse, his remains were buried in a shallow grave without a coffin on the site of what was once Greyfriars church.

DNA tests from one of the monarch's closest living relatives, a furniture maker from Canada living in London, were used to confirm the remains were those of the monarch.

Michael Ibsen himself has supported the Leicester burial plans, despite opposition from the other group of distant relatives.

Stephen Nicolay, a 16th great-nephew 
of the monarch and member of the Plantagenet Alliance, said: 'We have 
every hope that (we) will succeed in our quest to have Richard's 
remains buried at the most appropriate site, York Minster.'

Matthew Howarth, from Leeds-based law firm Gordons, said: 'We have now written officially to the Ministry 
of Justice and University of Leicester, notifying them that we plan to 
issue these claims.

'We will follow up by issuing the 
judicial review and other proceedings as soon as possible, but certainly
 within the next few weeks.'

King Richard grew up at Middleham Castle in the Yorkshire Dales and visited York several times during his 26-month reign.

Known as Richard of York before his coronation, he also funded part of the city's medieval gated walls.

The monarch's links with the area are 
celebrated to this day, with a Richard III Hotel in Middleham, a 
Yorkshire-made Richard III Wensleydale cheese and a Richard III Museum 
in York.

But the University of Leicester disputed the group's grounds for judicial review. 

In a statement, the university described its  licence as 'legitimate', therefore making it 'responsible' for the re-interment.

The statement read: 'Our decision was, and remains, that Richard III should be reinterred at Leicester Cathedral.

'The plan for reinterment in Leicester Cathedral was clearly stated and unambiguous at the start of the project and announced in a statement on Friday August 24 2012. This was before the dig started.

'Reinterment on the nearest consecrated ground is in keeping with good archaeological practice. Richard has lain in the shadow of St Martin's Cathedral, Leicester, for over 500 years.'

The group added that Leicester City Council initially gave permission for the excavation on the basis that the body would be buried at the nearby cathedral.

Reconstruction: The world's only facial reconstruction of Richard III unveiled 528 years after his death by Philippa Langley, originator of the 'Looking for Richard' project

They also refuted the group's right to be described as family members, saying: 'Richard III is believed to have no living descendants. Any distant relations are therefore descended from his siblings. Statistically speaking, many tens of thousands of individuals alive today are descended in this way.'

'There is no obligation to consult living relatives where remains are older than 100 years.'

The university also referred to a statement from York Minster made in February supporting the monarch's reburial in Leicester.

The spokesperson continued: 'The attempt to invoke Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights seems particularly odd given the distance of any relations and the years that have past.
