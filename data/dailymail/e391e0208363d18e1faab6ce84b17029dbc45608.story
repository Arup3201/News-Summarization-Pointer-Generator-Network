NHS doctor: Mirza Tariq Ali's terror group was linked to the Pakistan Taliban massacre of 132 children

An NHS doctor who fled the country to become a senior Taliban leader has been killed during an operation involving Pakistan security forces, it was claimed last night.

Dr Mirza Tariq Ali, 39, who worked in hospitals in London and Cambridge, was involved in extremist groups in the UK when he was charged with a violent disorder at protest in London. 

But before his court appearance, he skipped bail to fight for the Taliban in Pakistan where he fronted extremist propaganda including a chilling recruitment video.

Last year, his terror group was linked to the Pakistan Taliban massacre of 132 children in Peshawar.

While in the UK, Ali was a close associate of extremist cleric Anjem Choudary as well as a number of UK jihadists who have gone to fight for Islamic State in Syria.

Last night Choudary described Ali as a 'martyr' after he was reported killed by the Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI, which has carried out a number of counter-terrorism operations in the region.

In an obituary written by Choudary, he recalls an occasion when Ali operated on him in the back of a London café. 

Choudary also says he helped Ali to make a film of his experiences in Pakistan and the UK which Ali later used as part of a jihadist recruitment video while he was with the Taliban in Pakistan. 

Today, British jihadist Abu Rahin Aziz, 33, who skipped bail last year to join the Islamic State in Syria, posted pictures on Twitter with the captions: 'Dr Tariq singing nasheeds [chants] in my house back in #UK, beautiful voice for nasheeds. May Allah accept him.'

Ehsanullah Ehsan, spokesman for the Taliban group which Ali had joined, vowed to avenge his death which he attributed to ISI and its Western allies. 

During his time in Pakistan, Ali also edited an online English-language jihadist magazine, called 'Ihya-e-Khilafat' (Revival of the Islamic Caliphate) aimed at recruiting Muslim youths from the west.

The extremist magazine which he helps to edit publishes contact details for potential jihadi youths and advises them not to use home computers which might be tracked by intelligence agencies.

The surgeon was convicted in the first-ever successful prosecution for Islamic sectarian violence in Britain after he was seen hitting a bystander over the head with a pole at a Central London rally in 2013.

But he skipped bail and was found guilty in his absence at the Old Bailey and sentenced to 15 months. 

He has since been struck off by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) after a hearing in Manchester. 

It was previously reported that he was fighting as a jihadist in Syria. But instead he travelled to Pakistan where he became a commander for a Taliban splinter-group under a new name - Dr Abu Obaidah Al-Islamabadi.

Massacre: The attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar in December killed 142 and the Taliban admitted responsibility for the atrocity

Depraved Taliban gunmen stormed the school in the north west Pakistani city with assault rifles and grenades, before their 'handlers' ordered them to detonate their suicide vests

Depraved: The majority of the victims, which included children as young as five, were shot at point blank range in the head or neck

Wearing a black turban, he was seen in a video clip saying: 'Allah blessed me with the passion of Jihad. 

'I left Britain with an intention to go to Iraq and join Islamic State, but I was arrested on the way and sent to prison in Croatia.'

In Choudary's obituary he said: 'Once we were acquainted I soon realised that Tariq Ali was no ordinary Muslim but rather in many respects an extremely exceptional one.'

Killed: Last night Ali was described as a 'martyr' after he was reported killed by the Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI, which has carried out a number of counter-terrorism operations in the region

Of his work as a doctor Choudary adds: 'Tariq's skill as an NHS surgeon working at the Royal Free Hospital amongst others was also something which he used for the benefit of others outside of his work time. 

'In once instance, instead of having me wait to be seen at the hospital to remove an infection in one of my fingers, Tariq brought his medical tools with local anaesthetic and operated at the back of a cafe local to me.

'I wasn't the only one to benefit from having such a skilled Surgeon as a friend.'
