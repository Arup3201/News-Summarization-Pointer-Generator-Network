Authorities in Southern California say a 69-year-old man who spent years as a high-ranking member of the Laos defense department helping the U.S. during the Vietnam War was killed Friday when his daughter ran him over as he was pleading with her to not drive drunk.

Riverside police Sgt. Dan Reeves said Saturday that 37-year-old Soukvilay Barton ignored her fatherâ€™s pleas not to drive and backed her BMW convertible out of the garage, striking him.

Witness say Barton stopped the car after seeing that her father was injured and sat sobbing before being taken into custody.

Her father reportedly then stood behind her vehicle and she backed the car into him.

'He had to swim across the Mekong River to get to Thailand because the 
communists had come to kill him,' said the man, who spoke in front of 
the home with a large American flag above the garage, pe.com reports. 'They were killing
 all the Laos military that helped the United States.'

The son-in-law, who asked to not be identified, says Rajsombath came to the U.S. in 1979 with his wife. The couple settled in southern California and had two sons and two daughters.

The man said Rajsombath worked as a plumber until he injured his arm in a fall about 10 years ago.

The son-in-law says that even after his injury, Rajsombath would often do plumbing work for free for people who couldn't afford it.

'He was a person that everybody loved,' he said. 'He was a very respected man in the Laos community.'

The man declined to speak about what caused Rajsombath's death, saying only that 'I'm very sad. I'm sick.

Barton was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence and held on $75,000 bond.
