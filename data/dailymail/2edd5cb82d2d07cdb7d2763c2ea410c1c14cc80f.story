Some of the Queens Park Rangers players and staff look as if the Christmas spirit has taken hold at Loftus Road. The same can't be said for a number of others. 

Harry Redknapp's side have forgone a fully-fledged festive party, but did opt to record a miming version of Slade's Merry Christmas Everyone to amuse. 

At least that's what you'd hope. 

Shaun Wright-Phillips didn't look overly impressed to be included in the QPR Christmas video 

Ex-Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand was a part of the rendition by the Premier League side

Striker Charlie Austin got involved as the Hoops brought some festive cheer to their supporters 

Although midfielder Karl Henry looked as if he'd rather be elsewhere as they mimed Slade's festive hit

The QPR video - involving a raft of first team players including the energetic Rio Ferdinand and rather static Shaun Wright-Phillips - has caught the imagination online. 

'This is the best and worse thing I've seen' one supporter tweeted the Rs. 

But you cannot decry the efforts of Leroy Fer, Clint Hill and Glenn Hoddle, who give their mimicking a proper go. 

And even Redknapp gave it a whirl. You can't blame them for having a bit of fun - they've not lost at home since the middle of October.  

Coach Glenn Hoddle appeared jolly as he sang along to Merry Christmas Everyone 

Former England striker Bobby Zamora got into the swing of things in front of the club's cameras
