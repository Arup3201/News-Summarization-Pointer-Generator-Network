A Pizza Hut job advert which said it was looking for 'decent, good-looking girls' to work a part-time reception role in its Leatherhead store has been pulled following complaints it is 'sexist'

A Pizza Hut job advert which said it was looking for 'decent, good-looking girls'  to work in one of its stores has been pulled after complaints it is sexist. 

The advert for the chain's Leatherhead eaterie was posted on website Gumtree but was removed after it was reported to Pizza Hut's head office.

The advert said: 'Pizza Hut Leatherhead looking for full and part time drivers. Need to have your own car.

'We are also looking for a decent good looking girls for Reception. That role is just part time.'

Jackie Quinn, Leatherhead's Chamber of Commerce president, slammed the advert's wording.

She said: 'It is clearly sexist - and it's just not acceptable to be sexist.

'I'm sure it's a one-off error, someone's done it without thinking but it doesn't make it right.

'I think it's a shame, the company has let itself down.

'They're in the wrong and they should never have done it.

'As a woman in business I've had this sort of thing happen to me and you do get used to it but it doesn't make it right and in a professional company it shouldn't be allowed to happen.

'Realistically I do think they have to let that person go.

'I don't think it's acceptable and a national company of that size should have trained their staff well enough not to do that.

Speaking to the Dorking and Leatherhead Advertiser, she added: 'I would like to see their head on a block and they should be made an example of because, in this day and age, it's unacceptable and the company should have procedures in place to have kept that from happening.'

A spokesman for the Leatherhead franchise would not comment except to say 'It has been dealt with and taken down.'

A spokesman for Pizza Hut said: 'We do not condone this advertisement, which goes against the guidelines, policies and practices of Pizza Hut.

'It was an individual error of judgment from an employee, which was quickly taken down, and the issue is now being managed internally. 

'We do not tolerate any discrimination of any kind and are committed to creating equal opportunities in a safe working environment.'
