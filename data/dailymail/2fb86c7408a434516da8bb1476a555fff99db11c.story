The Director of Public Prosecutions is under pressure to review the ‘dangerous’ decision not to charge two doctors who agreed to arrange abortions for women who did not want girls.

There was anger yesterday at the decision by the Crown Prosecution Service not to bring the cases to court, even though officials admitted there was a realistic prospect of conviction.

The DPP, Keir Starmer QC, said it was ‘a very difficult and finely balanced decision’ but would reveal no more details about why it was reached. The reasons would be made public ‘in due course’.

A CPS official said that pursuing the case was deemed not to be in the public interest because no abortions were carried out and because the doctors could be suspended or struck off by their professional body, the General Medical Council.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has asked Attorney General Dominic Grieve for ‘urgent clarification’ of the reasons, and said abortion for reasons of gender selection is ‘completely unacceptable’.

Nineteen months ago, the two doctors were secretly filmed by undercover journalists from The Daily Telegraph having consultations with pregnant women who pretended they wanted an abortion only because of the sex of their unborn child.

This is illegal under the 1967 Abortion Act, which states that abortion is allowed up to 24 weeks into a pregnancy if having the baby poses a risk to the mental or physical health of mother or child.

One consultant, Prabha Sivaraman who worked for private and NHS hospitals in Manchester, was recorded telling a woman: ‘I don’t ask questions. If you want a termination, you want a termination.’

At the Calthorpe Clinic in Edgbaston, Birmingham, Dr Palaniappan Rajmohan was also filmed agreeing to the procedure, telling the woman he would put down on the paperwork that she was too young.

Sources close to the Scotland Yard investigation told the newspaper the cases were not being pursued for ‘political’ reasons because the case was ‘sensitive’.

Yesterday Shadow Attorney General Emily Thornberry said the decision not to prosecute was ‘scandalous’.

In a strongly-worded letter to Mr Starmer, she demanded he urgently review the decision, which she said would ‘completely undermine’ efforts to tackle violence against women and girls, and Parliament, which makes the laws.

‘This is a profound mistake’, she told the Mail. ‘Are they saying people who have a professional body should be pursued that way, and only people who don’t have one need to go to court and face criminal charges? This is ridiculous on so many levels.

‘Abortion on grounds of gender selection is a terrible crime, and the law is crystal clear on this.’

Official statistics released last year showed unusual variation in ratios of boys and girls born to mothers from certain countries.

Mr Starmer’s predecessor, Lord McDonald, said he hoped the decision not to prosecute had not been made for reasons of cultural sensitivity.

He said: ‘These offences are obviously sensitive, they are very difficult to detect and the statistics seem to show that they may be becoming more common in certain communities, so where they are detected I would have thought there’s a strong public interest in prosecuting them... to deter other people.

‘I certainly hope it’s not [for cultural reasons] because that would be a serious error and it would lead to partiality in prosecution decisions.’

Lord McDonald told Radio 4’s Today programme it was ‘a highly dubious proposition’ to say a professional alleged to have committed a crime should only answer to their regulator, and avoid charges.

Jenny Hopkins, deputy chief crown prosecutor for CPS London, said allowing a termination on the basis of sex selection alone was a criminal offence.

But officials had ruled there was no public interest in pursuing it because no abortion was actually carried out and because the doctors could be suspended or struck off by the General Medical Council.

‘On balance there is enough  evidence to justify bringing proceedings for an attempt,’ she said. ‘The evidence in this case was finely balanced and the law gives quite a wide discretion to doctors to determine when a risk to the health and well-being of a pregnant woman exists.’
