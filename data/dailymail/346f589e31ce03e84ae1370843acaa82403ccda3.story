More than £8.3million was spent on a computer system for the BBC to monitor foreign news which has never worked.

The system called Socrates, which stood for Specialised, Open source, Collection, Reversioning, Archiving, Tailored, Export, System), was set up at Caversham Park, in Berkshire, and promised to translate languages from audio into written English. 

It had been planned that Socrates would be operational by 2009, six years after it was commissioned, but the BBC is still using the old system.

However, the BBC has now confirmed that the project has come to an end. 

The revelation has angered staff because the spend happened at the same time the Corporation was making budget cuts totalling £3million and axing 60 jobs.

One member of staff is reported to have come up with a better acronym for the computer system: 'Spend our cash recklessly on a totally empty system'. 

The BBC monitoring station analyses and translates around 100 languages but is having to monitor the world's media with 'antiquated and temperamental equipment that belongs to a museum' according to a member of staff who spoke to The Independent.

The BBC Monitoring Service was set up in 1939 by the Government and is based in Berkshire

Socrates was meant to make things easier and was created by Cambridge company Autonomy. 

In the past the BBC monitoring service has been praised for exposing the Iranian TV's mistranslation of speeches given by Egyptian President Muhammad Mursi and by the United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. 

It also detected the absence of Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi in the media, who died last August.

In a statement, the BBC said: 'The BBC and Autonomy have reached an amicable settlement to conclude the 2008 contract to provide an IT system to the BBC.

'We will continue to utilise the hardware and software as part of BBC Monitoring’s core business.'

The BBC Monitoring Service was set up in 1939 by the government to monitor the broadcasts of enemy countries during the Second World War.

It was supported by the Pentagon and provided information to the news department at the BBC and the government.

It's home in Caversham Park is a 160-year-old Italian baroque-style stately home.
