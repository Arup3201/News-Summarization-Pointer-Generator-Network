Two young sisters have been orphaned after losing both their parents in separate tragedies within two days.

Crystal Rose Cooper, 38, died from a medical condition on March 5 after collapsing in a livestock arena. Her husband, 71-year-old John Cooper, was killed in a car accident the next day.

The double tragedy has robbed Emily, 16, and Hallie, 11, from Prague, Oklahoma, of their loving parents, who instilled in them a passion for the care and showing of livestock.

'I cannot imagine what these girls are going through at all,' the girls' devastated aunt, Misty Griffith, told News Channel 4.

Tragedy struck last week as Emily, Hallie and their mom were preparing their goats for a Future Farmers of America display in Prague's show arena.

Out of the blue, Crystal Cooper collapsed and was rushed to hospital.

'She was on the ground, she was just clipping goats and fell over,' the girls' aunt, Misty Griffith, said. 'She said hold on and just fell over.'

At 6am the next morning, the girls were told their mom had died.

Young Emily was scheduled to participate in the goat show that morning. She was given the option of pulling out.

But in an incredible show of strength, the grieving teen chose to honor her family's commitment to the show and competed, taking out the top awards.

'I saw a girl with incredible strength. Emily said, 'This has been a big part of mom and Iâ€™s life and I want to honor her by doing what we were getting ready to do',' Prague FFA advisor Tanner Thompson said.

But the emotional rollercoaster ride wasn't over for the Cooper girls.

Just 48 hours after losing their mom, the girls received a phone call with news their father, John Cooper, had died in a car accident. Details of the crash have not been released.

'My heart was torn to pieces. I sat in my bed and I cried because I hurt so much for her (Emily),' Racine Cleveland, whose own mother died when she was in the eighth grade, told World Now.

'It's more difficult than anyone could ever imagine.'

The girls are being cared for by their family in Prague.
