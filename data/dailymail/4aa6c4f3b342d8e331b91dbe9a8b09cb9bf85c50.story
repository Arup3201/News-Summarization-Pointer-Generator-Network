A self-confessed 'loner' has been arrested after planning to launch a murderous shooting spree in a movie theatre during the opening weekend of the new Twilight film.

Blaec Lammers had already bought a ticket to a screening of Breaking Dawn Part 2 in Bolivar, Missouri on Sunday night, and was stockpiling weapons to use in his assault.

The 20-year-old admitted to police that he was inspired by a number of well-publicised mass shootings, such as James Holmes' attack on a theatre showing The Dark Knight Rises in Aurora, Colorado in July.

Lammers was reported to police by his mother yesterday, according to the Springfield News-Leader, after she became concerned when he bought two guns despite never having been shooting before.

She said they reminded her of the weapons used in the Aurora shooting, in which 12 audience members were killed, and feared her son might be planning a similar atrocity.

He voluntarily attended an interview with Bolivar police, and initially claimed that he had bought the guns in order to go hunting.

But when officers brought up well-known gun massacres, Lammers 'stated that he had a lot in common with the people that have been involved in those shootings', according to a police report.

He also described himself as 'quiet' and 'kind of a loner', and admitted that he had been plagued with 'homicidal thoughts'.

Lammers then confessed he had bought two assault rifles and 400 rounds of ammunition with the intention of shooting movie-goers at the Twilight screening on Sunday, to which he had already bought a ticket.

He visited a nearby town earlier this week to practice shooting at a range.

The suspect also said he was thinking about going to the local branch of Walmart to 'just start shooting people at random', so that he would have access to extra ammunition if he ran out of bullets.

On Friday morning, Lammers was charged with first-degree assault, making a terrorist threat and armed criminal action, according to court documents.

Inspiration: Lammers planned to imitate James Holmes, who killed 12 movie-goers in Aurora, Colorado

'Thankfully we had a responsible family member or we might have had a different outcome,' Bolivar police chief Steve Hamilton said. He said Lammers is under a doctor's care for mental illness, and court documents said he was 'off of his medication.'

Mr Hamilton said it appeared that Lammers obtained the firearms legally but that police were continuing to investigate 'to determine how in fact he was able to obtain a permit.'

Ashley Miller, who lives in a nearby town, said she has known Lammers for about a year and described him as 'one of the sweetest guys I had ever met' but 'very emotional,' noting he would periodically stop talking to her.

She said he told her that he had bounced between relatives growing up. As an adult, he bounced between girlfriends, she said.

'He was never actually happy,' she added. 'I think he had depression or something.'
