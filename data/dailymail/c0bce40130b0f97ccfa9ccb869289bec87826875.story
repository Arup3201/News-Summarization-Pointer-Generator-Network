A medieval castle in Tuscany set over more than 1,500 acres has gone on sale in Italy making it the largest private home on the market. 

The stunning estate found slightly east of Siena boasts farmhouses, vineyards, woodland and sunflower fields in its grounds. 

Built in the early 12th Century it is one of few medieval castles which remain in Europe and is thought to have been the home of Pope Pius II and III at one time. 

The property, whose owners wish to keep themselves and the castle's name unknown, is being sold by Sotheby's International for 28 million euros - almost £20million.

A medieval castle in Tuscany set over more than 1500 acres has gone on sale for just under £20million making it the largest private home on the property market

The castle has its own restaurant where wines made from the grapes in its vineyards are served alongside produced farmed from the grounds

While it is not known who first lived in the castle or commissioned its construction the property remained in the hands of one prominent family for centuries. 

The Piccolomini family are thought to have lived there intermittently from the 15th Century. Two of the family's most notable members, Enea Silvio Piccolomini and Francesco Piccolomini went on to become Popes Pius II and III. 

Little is known of how the noble family cultivated their wealth other than that many of their riches were acquired through trading. 

Having spent decades in the ownership of the family, the castle it changed hands sometime in the 1920s.

The new owner remained anonymous, selling on the sprawling estate again in the 1980s. 

It has since remained in the possession of its current owners who refused to disclose why they were moving on. While estate agents are reluctant to reveal exactly where in the rolling Tuscan hills the special property can be found, they promised it to be one of rare value. 

'It's very rare in Italy to have a medieval castle, there are so many that came before and after, mostly after, but to find a medieval one is rare,' said John Jonk, who is handling the sale for Sotheby's International. 

'All the original fireplaces and ceilings are in tact. It's a very special opportunity.' 

While in total the estate has more than 100 bedrooms most are found in farmhouses and smaller properties scattered across its grounds. These are rented out as holiday accommodation while its vineyard and restaurant attracts diners. 

In the castle itself are 10 bedrooms and as many bathrooms, a drawing room and dining room. 

Elsewhere on its sprawling grounds are sunflower fields and farmland, added Mr Jonk. 

The villa just east of Sienna is one of few from the early 12th Century which remain in Italy. All its fireplaces and ceilings have been preserved from their original state 

Aside from the property's 10-bedroom main castle there are several farmhouses scattered around its grounds from the same era 

The Piccolomini family are thought to have lived in the castle intermittently from the 15th Century and two of the family's most notable members, Enea Silvio Piccolomini and Francesco Piccolomini went on to become Popes Pius II and III

The castle is a very rare find in Italy because it dates back to medieval times, according to John Jonk, who is handling the sale for Sotheby's International

Mysteriously the existence of the castle is not widely known and it has never really been filmed or appeared on television

The castle also has its own chapel and vineyard. It belonged to the same family for generations before being sold privately in 1920 

'There's a lot of woodland, there's a vineyard. 

'From some parts of the property there are views of Siena too.' 

Although the property is one of the few remaining of its kind in Italy it has remained mysteriously off the radar for decades. 

 'That's the interesting part - there have been television crews that have come from Rome over the years and have interviewed people in the restaurant in the castle but it hasn't really been used for filming or anything like that,' Mr Jonk said. 

In its restaurant staff serve red wine and food produced on the grounds. With herds of boar and deer roaming its fields too there is no shortage of wildlife to entertain visitors. 

'When people talk about organic foods, this is what is meant. In Italy everything is still quite good that way, it's very organic.' 

Despite its large price tag, Mr Jonk added the property had attracted attention from all over the world. 

'We have had interest from European buyers and non-European buyers. 

'It's a special opportunity for someone who can afford it but, as I tell my clients, to find an exclusive property in London nowadays wouldn't cost much less.'

The estate has attracted interest from potential buyers across the globe , despite its rather large price tag

From some parts of the extensive grounds the 12th Century property was said to boast stunning views of the Siena

Sotheby's John Jonks said: 'It's a special opportunity for someone who can afford it but, as I tell my clients, to find an exclusive property in London nowadays wouldn't cost much less.'

With sprawling grounds, multiple smaller properties and access to your own vineyard, many can see the perks of paying £20million for their own Tuscan castle in Italy. 

But any hopes of snapping up a similar deal closer to home have been dashed by the ever inflating prices of London flats. 

For roughly the same price as the castle near Siena, house-hunters can just about afford a three-bedroom flat in the heart of the capital. 

While One Hyde Park apartments afford owners an exclusive postcode and plush surroundings - set between Harrods and Harvey Nichols in London's Knightsbridge - the glass-fronted flats don't quite offer as much space. 

In fact the internal floor space of one flat sold last year for more than £20million was less than 4,000 sq ft.
