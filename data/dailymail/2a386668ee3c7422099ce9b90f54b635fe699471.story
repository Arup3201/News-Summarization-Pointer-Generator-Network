Baby steps: An adorable Beagle transforms from pup to fully-grown pooch in a YouTube video montage watched more than 250,000 times

Tiny tot: The film titled 'Beagle puppy Louie from eight weeks to eight months' shows how the dog is almost the same height as a ketchup bottle in the beginning

His owner, who does not reveal his identity, shows in one clip how he has resorted to hiding his slippers in the bathtub to stop Louie from destroying them.

'No! You ain't [sic] getting my slippers!' he states in a caption overlapping the screen.

But the tactic fails and seconds later the dog is seen running around the garden with one shoe in his mouth.

A man's best friend: At eight weeks old Louie is so small, one clip shows him happily sleeping in the nook of his owner's shoulder

Sought-after: Although Beagle-type dogs have existed for over 2,000 years, the modern breed was developed in Britain around the 1830s

Another scene shows the bathroom door
 open with toilet paper strewn all over the floor and later Louie is 
seen hauling a patio scrapper through the snow with his teeth.

Demonstrating
 his strength, he also appears to be taking the lead in a photograph 
showing him on a stroll through the countryside.

In a description for the four-minute-33-second-long video Louie's owner describes him as 'demolition dog.'

On the scent: The most famous Beagle of all is Snoopy from the comic strip Peanuts

Top dog: And according to the American Kennel Club Registration Statistics the breed is one of the most popular in the U.S.

Up to no good: Along with his size, Louie's antics get increasingly mischievous with footballs punctured, mailbags ripped open and slippers seized

But he adds that training has improved his behavior and now, aged one-year-and-four-months oldLouie can sit, lie down, stay, shake hands and roll over on command.

Among Louie's 'firsts' caught on camera are him taking a run, producing a howl and stepping out into the snow.

Thousands of fellow pet owners have left comments stating how they can relate to the footage.

 am still proud and love him to bits.'

Another
 wrote: 'Gorgeous beagle. I've watched this video about five times and 
never gets old. I wish I had made videos when my beagle was younger.'

Louie's owner has uploaded more than 
six videos documenting the pup's antics. He concludes: 'Beagles you just
 gotta [sic] love them! . . Best breed ever!'

Well-earned rest: Add after all of that fresh air the dog seems exhausted

Sprawling out: At the end of the movie Louie is too big for his pet bed and takes to the sofa instead

Although beagle-type dogs have existed for over 2,000 years, the modern breed was developed in Britain around the 1830s from several breeds, including the Talbot Hound, the North Country Beagle, the Southern Hound, and possibly the Harrier.

Beagles have been depicted in popular culture since Elizabethan times in literature and paintings, and more recently in film, television and comic books.

The most famous Beagle of all is Snoopy from the comic strip Peanuts.

According to the American Kennel Club Registration Statistics, the breed is one of the most popular dogs in the U.S.
