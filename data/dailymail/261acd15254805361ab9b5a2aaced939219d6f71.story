Any tourists in London hoping to see the famous OXO lettering on the eponymous tower tonight might be a tad bewildered... unless they also happen to be gaming fans.

The iconic landmark on the South Bank has been given a cunning makeover on the eve of the US launch of the new PS4 console.

The side of the building was marked with the PlayStation's control pad symbols: Circle, Cross, Square, Triangle.

Over the next two weeks, Sony and Microsoft will be launching the latest versions of their popular PlayStation and Xbox video game consoles in head-to-head retail campaigns going into the holiday shopping season. 

London's OXO Tower, on the South Bank, has undergone a transformation to celebrate the build-up to the UK launch of the new PlayStation console, as well as its imminent release in the US

To herald the UK launch on Novermber 29, the side of the building was marked with the console's control pad symbols: Circle, Cross, Square, Triangle

The PS4, the first new version of the platform in eight years, goes on sale in Britain on November 29, while the Xbox One is out exactly one week earlier.

Prices for the PS4 will start at £349 - significantly lower than the new XBox One model, which will retail at £429.

Most of the best PlayStation 4 games will be available on Microsoft's new console as well.

For die-hard fans who can't wait another two weeks, Sony is providing access to a dedicated PS4 lounge where they can try out the console before its release.

The lounge, in Covent Garden, will open its doors from tomorrow until December 1.

Prices for the PS4 will start at £349 - significantly lower than Microsoft's soon-to-launch XBox One model, which will retail at £429

The tower as it normally looks. It was acquired by the OXO cube makers in the 1920s

In the 1990s, the building and tower were refurbished to a high standard, giving the building over to shops, galleries, residential and restaurant space, with the latter opening as Oxo Tower Restaurant in 1996

The PS4's launch line-up includes 22 games to attract fans of just about any genre, from military shooters to sports simulations to family-friendly adventures.

It also offers such a wealth of easily accessible media apps, including Hulu and Netflix, that it may draw even the non-gamers in your household.

The PlayStation 4 is a slender, unobtrusive box that plugs into your TV via HDMI cable.

Once you've turned on the power, it takes just a few minutes to connect to the Internet and create or update a free account on Sony's PlayStation Network. 

Workers brave the heights to give the iconic tower by the Thames a special facelift to herald the launch of the console - which is not compatible with PS3 titles

The PS4's on-screen user interface has been streamlined, with a horizontal bar of large icons for games and apps.

Above that is a line of smaller icons that let you connect with other PlayStation owners, change system settings or access the PlayStation Store, where you can download new games and buy or rent movies.

You navigate through all this with Sony's new DualShock 4 controller. The old ones won't work.

Like previous controllers, DualShock 4 offers vibration and motion sensing.

It now has a clickable touchpad as well.

And Sony says the PlayStation 4 has ten times the processing power of the PS3.

That should translate into higher screen resolution (up to 1080p) and faster frame rates (up to 60 frames per second), meaning more detailed environments, more realistic lighting, smoother animation and huge online multiplayer matches.

But as it has new hardware, you won't be able to play any of your PS3 games on the new machine.

An Amazon warehouse filled with PS4 consoles awaiting shipment

To those who have grown up in Britain, the brand of Oxo is well-known for its stock cubes.

Although the building was originally built as a power station for the Post Office in the late 19th century, it was acquired by LiebIg (Oxo’s manufacturers) in the late 1920s.

While much of the building was demolished, the façade remained and was extended.

Architect Albert W Moore proposed spelling out Oxo in electric lights on the tower, but was refused permission, so the compromise of Oxo written in the window panes was agreed.

However, after Oxo moved out, over the years, the building fell into decline.

A new dawn was heralded when was acquired by the Coin Street Community Builders in 1984.

In the 1990s, the building and tower were refurbished to a high standard, giving the building over to shops, galleries, residential and restaurant space, with the latter opening as Oxo Tower Restaurant in 1996.
