An Ohio schoolgirl was ordered to cover up her arms at a Valentine's Day dance - because teachers deemed them to be 'sexual objects'.

Seventh grader Ari Waters had picked out a pretty yellow  dress for a Valentine's Day dance at Mt. Orab Middle School, believing it to be elegant.

But she was left mortified when a male teacher approached her at the dance to ask her to cover up her arms.

When her horrified mother Gina demanded to know why exactly her young daughter had been asked to put a coat on, she was told by the vice principal it was because her arms were 'sexual objects'.

Anger: Ari Waters was told to cover up after arriving at a dance in this dress - because it showed her arms

Shock: Ari's mother Gina was horrified to discover her daughter had been asked to cover up because her arms were considered to be 'sexual objects' - although the school denies this was ever said

Ms Waters has since spoken out against the school - deeming teachers' behaviour towards her young daughter entirely inappropriate.

'These middle schoolers are 10 years of age up to 13,' she told Local12.

'They're kids. They're not sexual beings. That word should never have been used and it should never have been associated with an arm, with a limb.'

It was later revealed Ari was one of three to six students at the school asked to cover their 'sleeveless attire'.

The youngster witnessed at least one other girl being asked to cover up her arms because she was in a spaghetti-strap dress.

Ari, meanwhile, has said she has been left feeling 'dirty' - and was so embarrassed on the night she called her mother to pick her up.

Upset: Ms Waters was so cross about the incident, she has spoken out publicly on her daughter's behalf

Embarrassed: Ari says she was left feeling 'dirty' - and asked her mother to pick her up early

Dress code: A statement from the school also said the dress code (pictured) was made clear before the dance

But Mt. Orab Middle School has stood by its decision, saying in a statement it has a dress code which students have to abide by at school functions.

Headteacher Sabrina Armstrong said the students had been 'explicitly told' they were expected to dress a certain way several weeks before the dance.

However, she denies the vice principal called Ari's arms sexual objects.

'The district has looked into the situation and deemed them to be unfounded,' Ms Armstrong said in a statement.
