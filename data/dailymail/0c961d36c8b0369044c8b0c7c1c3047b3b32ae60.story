'Seriously if you followed me because of those articles then you have to go donate to @CoryBooker's campaign,' she tweeted.

She
 also joked, 'Do I need to hire a publicist to tell me when to post 
nudes now? these 5 min of fame are gonna be tough for my daddy issues.'

Later she added, 'my favorite part is that Buzzfeed is what I named my vibrator.'

In response to the BuzzFeed article, Booker spokesman Kevin Giffis told the Daily Intelligencer, 'I think it’s pretty well known that the mayor talks with people from all walks of life on Twitter.

'There have been a couple of stories about that over the years. Really, the most shocking part of this story was learning there is a vegan strip club in Portland.'
