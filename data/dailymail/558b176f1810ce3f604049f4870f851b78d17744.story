Samir Nasri has given the clearest indication yet that he will quit international football following his World Cup snub at the hands of France coach Didier Deschamps. 

Nasri was left out of the squad this summer because Deschamps claimed that he did not play as well for his country as he does for Manchester City. The player’s Spanish girlfriend Anara Atanes responded on Twitter saying: ‘F*** france and f*** deschamps! What a s*** manager!’

It was the latest international disappointment for Nasri who was left out of France’s 2010 World Cup squad and then banned for three-games for verbally abusing a reporter at Euro 2012.

Raring to go: Nasri has enjoyed an extended summer holiday after missing the World Cup with France

Now the 27-year-old former Arsenal midfielder is ready to end his France career after winning 41 caps for his country and focus on achieving more success with City.

‘Yes, I’ve made the decision,’ said Nasri. ‘I took it a while ago but I’ll say it when the time is right. It’s not something you can just announce on Twitter.

‘I didn’t win anything with the national team so it’s more easy to take this decision than if we’d just won something. When you play for a big club and you play lots of games, it’s easy to come to this decision.

‘Maybe during the international breaks I can stay and work a little bit more. All the players who played the World Cup and have lots of games during the season with their national teams can get tired and pick up injuries, that kind of stuff. So I think I will be fresh.

‘Even before the summer, during Euro 2012 I had a lot going on. Personally it doesn’t affect me but it affects my family. They live in France, they read the press and stuff like that.

‘I live in England. I’m fine with everything they said and I’m used to it. But for my parents it’s really hard. I want to make them happy and the national team doesn’t make me happy.’

Asked if he would rather have been at the World Cup in Brazil this summer than having a rest after helping City to win a Premier League and Capital One Cup double last season, Nasri replied: ‘No, I’m quite happy with my holidays.

‘It’s always good to have a long summer break but you have to find a good balance – too long is not good. When I came back I suffered a little injury but I’m quite fresh and I just need more games to be ready for the start of the new season.

‘I’m excited about the new season. The Premier League will be really hard because every team has bought quality players. So it’s really exciting and we are looking forward to the start of the season.’
