The deaths of two people who drowned in a luxury hotel swimming pool could have been avoided if a lifeguard was on duty, a grieving family have claimed.

Married Komba Kpakiwa, 31, and his secret lover Josephine Foday, 22, were discovered floating in a swimming pool at Down Hall Country House Hotel in Hatfield Heath on the Essex and Hertfordshire border.

Chelmsford Coroners' Court earlier heard that the pair, who could not swim, had 
been guests at the hotel and had been spotted in difficulties by a guest 
who mistakenly thought they were 'joshing about' and were part of a Murder Mystery weekened. 

Today a jury at Chelmsford Coroners' Court concluded the pair had drowned as a result of an accident.

Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray confirmed she would send a report to the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health and Institution of Occupational Safety and Health to warn of the dangers of 'hopper' pools which slope in from all sides towards the middle of the deep end.

Outside of the court, grieving sister Angela Kpakiwa, who is in her 40s from Bedfordshire, slammed a lack of a lifeguard covering the hotel poolat the time of the tragedy.

She said: 'I am personally against a hotel like that without a lifeguard.

'We feel their deaths could have been avoided if there had been a lifeguard or if they had acted on the concerns raised a year earlier.'

Ms Kpakiwa was joined at the inquest by her two brothers, Tamba and Sahr, who confirmed the family are pursuing an apology from the hotel and are considering legal action.

Co-op worker Mr Kpakiwa had treated student nurse, Miss Foday, to a weekend at the luxury hotel to celebrate her 22nd birthday.

One hotel guest discovered the pair floating in the water - but thought they might be playing a 'practical joke' as he had read online that the hotel hosted Murder Mystery weekends.

He told the receptionist: 'Either someone is playing a big practical joke or a terrible accident has happened.'

Hotel staff dragged their lifeless bodies from the water around 8.10pm on Saturday, April 27 last year, but despite CPR from paramedics they were sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

The three-day inquest heard how a former guest had warned hotel bosses about the dangers of the 'hopper pool' - which slopes in from all sides towards the middle of the deep end - after 'almost drowning' there a year before the tragic deaths.

Leonard Tabner, 67, a landscape painter from North Yorkshire, gave hotel bosses the tragically prophetic warning: 'If something is not done, I can see someone drowning in that swimming pool.'

Hotel deputy general manager at the time, Craig Vines, told the inquest he was never passed the complaint.

Mr Vines said that the hotel had been full with around 200 guests, including a 75 person wedding party and three private functions, on theday of the tragedy.

The inquest was told the pool had been installed in 1987 and had been used by tens of thousands of people over more than two decades without serious incident.

Swimming pool design expert, Andrew Ebben, told the inquest that the pool had an 'unusual profile' before raising concerns over the steep gradient leading into the deep end.

Jurors visited the scene of the deaths on Wednesday morning to inspect the pool and a CCTV camera that covered the water area.

Post mortems on both Mr Kpakiwa and Miss Foday revealed both victims' deaths were 'consistent with drowning'.

Forensic pathologist, Dr Olaf Biedrzycki, who carried out the post mortem, noted a 'heavy vomit contamination' and evidence given to him suggested neither victim could swim - all supporting the drowning conclusion.

Toxicology results showed neither victim had drugs or alcohol in their system at the time of the tragic accident.

The jury was told a police investigation had ruled out any suspicious circumstances and water tests disproved any suggestion chemical levels in the water could have affected the pair.

Health and safety signs had been placed around the pool warning of its maximum depth of 2.1 metres, but vital CCTV footage of the pool had not been working at the time of the incident.

An engineer had been called to fix problems with the CCTV on the morning on the incident - but no temporary measures, such as a lifeguard, were put in place while it was offline.

Widow Gurpeet Kpakiwa sat in dignified silence as she heard three days of harrowing evidence about the death of her husband, although no family were present for Miss Foday.

Mrs Kpawika declined to comment after the inquest.

Uttlesford District Council, which is the health and safety enforcing authority for the hotel, has undertaken a full investigation into the accident and is currently considering legal action.

A spokesperson for Down Hall Country House hotel tonight said: 'We wish to express our deepest condolences to the family and friends of Komba Kpakiwa and Josephine Foday for their loss.

'The hotel acknowledges that the jury sitting at Chelmsford Coroners Court has returned a conclusion of accidental death.'
