Within the privacy of his consulting room at a Doncaster area village surgery, Gousul Islam serially groped teenage girls and young women

A lecherous GP who sexually assaulted women patients during medical examinations over three decades was jailed for 11 years yesterday.

Dr Gousul Islam, 70, regularly made inappropriate comments and propositioned patients and staff for sex.

In his consulting room at a village surgery, he serially groped teenage girls and young women.

Under the pretext of examinations, he fondled their breasts, stroked their thighs and touched them intimately.

The doctor asked the women to undress in his presence without a screen and lie on his treatment couch without a blanket or towel to protect their modesty.

Judge Simon Lawler said this was the ‘worst case of its kind by a professional man’ he had  encountered in 40 years.

Sheffield Crown Court heard that Islam single-handedly ran the Lyndhurst surgery in Stainforth, Doncaster, until 2009.

He asked one teenager to ‘strip off and go upstairs with him’ at his surgery and told her: ‘You are fit, you are stunning, you are beautiful.’

Islam repeatedly asked her to go on weekends away or watch videos with him at his house and told her he was not interested in his wife.

When she was seven months pregnant he jabbed her in the stomach and said: ‘What are you doing with that thing inside you? Get rid! I can’t do anything with you with that inside you.’

She said she was subjected to more than 30 unwarranted examinations from the age of 14 to 22.

Another patient, an attractive blonde, blamed Islam for ruining her sex life and wrecking her marriage, throughout which she remained a virgin.

She said she went to the doctor in her 20s over her problems with intercourse and the GP told her: ‘Silly girl, your partner must be tearing his hair out.’

The woman said he made her feel like a ‘freak’ and he even examined her ‘down below’ when she complained of a sore throat.

She said: ‘You knew he was going to have a quick feel. You just knew what was coming.’

Judge Simon Lawler jailed Gousul Islam for 11 years for indecently assaulting seven patients. Speaking at Sheffield Crown Court, the judge called Islam's actions 'the grossest possible breach of trust of your position as a doctor'

Another victim complained the GP examined her breasts even when she saw him for an injured wrist.

He also targeted his staff. Islam told a new practice nurse: ‘You will have sex with me.’

He propositioned the 27-year-old in his Mercedes car after they went to an educational evening hosted by a pharmaceutical firm.

He told the married nurse an affair could ‘spice up’ a marriage before he slid his hand under her skirt.

He said he had ‘needs’ and offered to take her to medical conferences abroad with him. She rejected his advances and was so shocked that she quit.

Michelle Colborne, prosecuting, said Islam ‘exploited the naivety’ of his patients and ‘he succeeded because as the GP in a close-knit community he was in a position of trust and status and power.’

Islam was finally caught when one victim went to police in March 2010 and others came forward. He was suspended by the General Medical Council and will now be struck off.

The jury found him guilty of indecently assaulting seven women patients between 1970 and 1995.

Judge Simon Lawler, left, said the evidence showed Dr Gousul Islam, right had 'deliberately targeted' a small number of vulnerable patients for his own gratification

Judge Lawler described Islam’s catalogue of persistent sexual abuse as the ‘grossest breach of trust’ and a ‘terrible commentary on a medical man who took an oath to counsel and to care’.

Commenting on the victims who gave evidence, the judge said: ‘The court pays tribute to these women. They did not want to be here but felt it was their duty to speak out. They were right and they have seen justice.’ 

Some of them were in the public gallery to see the GP jailed and female jurors wept openly as sentence was passed.

Islam claimed to have acted with ‘professionalism and decorum’ at all times and said the women were either mistaken or had been lying.

His barrister Vanessa Marshall said: ‘This is clearly a very sad day for Dr Islam. As a convicted man he knows that the final stage of his life is ruined.’

Outside court Detective Chief Inspector Natalie Shaw said: ‘Police cannot commend enough the courage shown by all of these ladies who have come forward.’
