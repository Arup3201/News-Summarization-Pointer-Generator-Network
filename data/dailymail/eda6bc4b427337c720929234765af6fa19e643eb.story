A judge has decided against forcing a mentally impaired Nevada woman to have an abortion after the court and her family reached a tentative agreement to help her through her high-risk pregnancy.

The 32-year-old woman's legal guardian told local station KRNV-TV on Wednesday that district court Judge Egan Walker had agreed that the woman wants to carry the pregnancy to term and that the evidence doesn't show it's medically necessary to abort the baby.

The woman, who has the mental capacity of a 6-year-old, had wandered from a Reno group home that she was living in and became pregnant 13 weeks ago.

Big issue: The parents of a pregnant woman with a mental age of six and the Nevada court have agreed to help the woman carry her child to term even though it may put her health at risk

The child's father has not been 
identified, and it's unknown whether the pregnancy resulted from rape or
consensual sex, according to court documents.

The Associated Press is not naming the woman or her parental guardians because the circumstances of conception remain unclear.

The womanâ€™s parents, who hail from 
Fernley, Nevada, adopted the woman and several siblings from Costa Rica 
in 1992, and they were appointed as her legal guardians when she turned 
18. She suffers from fetal alcohol syndrome and epilepsy.

After taking the abortion option off 
the table, Walker said he plans to hold additional medical evidentiary 
hearings in the weeks ahead to determine the safest way to proceed.

The court became involved in late 
September, when officials with Social Services voiced concerns about the
effects that her medication could have on the fetus. The case quickly 
drew attention from anti-abortion advocates nationally.

The woman's parents said that while 
the pregnancy poses health risks to their daughter and the baby, medical
experts back their decision to continue the pregnancy.

Melissa Clement, president of Nevada Right to Life, praised the judge's announcement that abortion no longer was an alternative.

'We are pleased (the pregnant woman) 
will be able to carry her baby to term and that the court recognized 
that childbirth is a natural process and is the generally accepted 
course of treatment for pregnancy,' she said in a statement.

Deadline set: Legal hurdles in the case meant that it was brought to the state's supreme court but eventually the verdict was handed down a district court judge

Last week, the Nevada Supreme Court 
denied a request to block Walker's hearings into the health risks of the
woman's pregnancy. The woman's parents argued that the judge lacked the
authority to terminate the pregnancy of their daughter.

They claimed they have exclusive 
authority over her health care decisions, and they want their daughter 
to carry the baby to term in line with their Catholic religious beliefs.

The state Supreme Court disagreed, but the tentative agreement apparently makes the point moot.
