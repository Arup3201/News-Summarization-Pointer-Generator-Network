A teacher has resigned over Ebola fears after her school ordered her to stay home for 21 days following a mission trip to Kenya - even though there have been no cases of the virus there.

Susan Sherman, who worked for the Archdiocese of Louisville, Kentucky for 16 years, was asked to stay away from St Margaret Mary Catholic School because of parents' and parishioners' concerns. 

But Sherman, a registered nurse, complained that the demands were never properly communicated to her and that the decision was based on 'ignorance', she told WLKY.

'It is with sadness that I tell you that I have resigned my position as your teacher,' she wrote in a letter to students. 'Apparently, I have lost the trust of a large number of people in our school community.'

In the letter, which relatives shared on Facebook, she said that 'contrary to some perceptions, I did not go on this mission trip recklessly or without thought'. Rather, she  kept up-to-date with the news and took all of the necessary vaccinations and medications.

'This was my fourth trip to Migori, Kenya to work in the Kenya Relief clinic,' she explained. 'I went with full confidence that knowing that my hosts would take heroic measures to keep me and my fellow healthcare workers safe. I'm committed to return to Migori at least once each year.'

The 60-year-old had visited Kenya with her husband Paul, 64, a retired orthopedic surgeon, on a medical mission with the faith-based organization Kenya Relief, the Courier-Journal reported.

The tiny Kenyan village where she worked is more than 4,000 miles from where the main outbreak of the virus has been reported in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia in West Africa.

Despite the distance between her and the virus, parents and parishioners expressed their concerns - at a time when 'a new or suspected Ebola patient was being named [in the U.S.] each day,' the Archdiocese said in a statement shared with WHAS11.

'Some St. Margaret Mary parents were googling and distributing media articles naming Kenya as a "high risk" country and were approaching the local media about their fears,' it said.

'Unfortunately attempts to communicate facts and reduce fear were unsuccessful, so parish administrators decided to ask Mrs. Sherman upon her return to take a precautionary leave of 21 days with pay and to secure a doctor's note about her health.

'This decision was made to protect the well-being of students in light of the uproar.'

But  the requested leave was 'not effectively communicated' to the teacher and she only learned about the leave when she returned from the trip, the Archdiocese said.

'This communication failure is unacceptable, and the leadership of St. Margaret Mary and the Archdiocese has apologized to Mrs. Sherman for this failure,' it continued.

'Mrs. Sherman, however, communicated to the parish that in light of the poor communication and all that had been transpired, she felt unwelcome and did not see how she could effectively continue as a teacher.' 

Clash: She has worked for the district for nearly 20 years but had started at St Margaret Mary Catholic School, pictured, only earlier this year. The Archdiocese said it regretted her decision to resign

The school 'is deeply apologetic for any pain that this situation has caused Mrs. Sherman and very much regrets Mrs. Sherman's decision to resign,' it said.

The school is now working to replace Sherman. 

The Shermans said that other members of the team who went to Kenya have returned to their jobs without any problems. 

Mrs Sherman had worked for the Archdiocese as a teacher from 1998 to 2004, and then continued as a substitute teacher. She joined St Margaret's this year.

'More than anything I want educators to educate, and parents to support them, and administrators to support the educators,' she wrote in a statement. 'Then the kids get the best education and that is part of the problem here, the kids were lost in this equation.'
