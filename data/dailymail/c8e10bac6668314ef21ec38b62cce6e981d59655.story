500 pounds of methamphetamine was seized as part of a drug bust in California's Contra Costa County, it has emerged.

Twenty-two people were arrested and $723,635 was also seized by authorities, the Office of the Attorney General said in a Monday news release.

'The takedown, named Operation Road Trip, represents the culmination of several related investigations targeting California-based Drug Trafficking Organizations (DTO) connected to Mexico’s Sinaloa Federation drug cartel,' the release said.

Seized: Over 1100 pounds of methamphetamine were recovered during the investigation, along with drugs and thousands of dollars 

It emerged that the Nitro gang would receive the drug, and 'would make regular "road trips" to Contra Costa County in order to distribute to other DTOs, including the Urtiz gang based in Northern California,' the release from the Office of the Attorney General said.

 Four vehicles as well as a gun were also seized during Operation Road Trip, it stated.

As part of Operation Red Reach, which ran for two years, 135 pounds of meth was seized, along with 26 illegal guns and about $150,000, the office said. 26 people also were convicted.

'This operation [...] shut down a network of local and transnational gangs, including a Nortenos gang in western Contra Costa County,' the release said.

The drug trafficking connection between the Nitro and Urtiz gangs then emerged in Operation Crystal Lens, according to the release.

'Road trip': The Nitro gang reportedly traveled to Contra Costa County to distribute the drugs 

It stated that the West Contra Costa County Narcotic Enforcement Team (West-NET) Task Force was the leading group for both Operation Red Reach and Operation Crystal Reach.

WEST-NET Task Force also reportedly worked with the Los Angeles Interagency Metropolitan Police Apprehension Crime Task Force (LA IMPACT) along with other groups on Operation Road Trip.

The Office of the Attorney General said 'In total, the three linked investigations, Operation Red Reach, Crystal Lens and Road Trip, have resulted in the total seizure of 1109 pounds of methamphetamine, for a street value of $40,242,504, the seizure of 48 firearms, 10 vehicles, $1.82 million in U.S. Currency and the total arrests of 67 individuals for drug, and firearms related violations.'
