A dowdy young farmer teased for being an 'ugly duckling' at school has swapped her wellies for stilettos and is now set to become one of Europe's top models.

Nicole Skinner, 21, spent most of her teenage years in boots and overalls helping muck out on her parents' farm in Lincolnshire.

The shy teenager only had two friends at school, where she was shunned for her unkempt appearance, and spent most of her time with her horses.

Beauty: Farmer Nicole Skinner has made an astonishing transformation from ugly duckling to top model

Shunned: Nicole was rejected by classmates for being unkempt and preferring to spend time with her pony

But after discovering make-up on her 18th birthday, Nicole started to turn heads in her local pub and with her confidence boosted, decided to take up modelling because she 'needed another hobby'.

And her hobby has paid off. Just three years into her modelling career, she stunned friends and family by winning the prestigious Europe's Perfect Cover Model 2013 award last month and will now represent Britain in Orlando, Florida, in the world finals in August

Council administrator Nicole said: 'It's all been a bit overwhelming because up until a few years ago I had no confidence in myself whatsoever.

'I was called an ugly duckling at school. I was always on the farm in my overalls and slacks. I didn't really discover make-up until I was about 18 when I got some on my birthday - I didn't even know how to put it on.

'When I went out I suddenly got people noticing me and telling me I looked nice. I realised I liked looking good and it just went from there.

'My friends suggested I had some professional pictures done and the photographer said I was a natural. He made some calls to modelling agencies and it went from there.

'Then I had to learn how to walk in high heels because I was only use to wellies from mucking out the horses.

'I never had any self confidence, I was shy and I only really had two friends at school. I got to 18 and I thought I need a new hobby. So I thought sod it, let's try modelling.'Along with the Europe's Perfect Cover Model 2013 award, Nicole has triumphed in other modelling competitions, including Miss Galaxy Lincolnshire in 2011 and United Kingdom's Perfect Cover Mode the following year.

The former farmer also models for swimwear designer Sandstorm Luxury.

She added: 'I felt like the outcast at the first competition. Most of the girls are a little bit different from me. 

'But the second time I was much more confident and now I've really come out of my shell - I never dreamed I would be modelling swimwear.

'It's safe to say I'm not as shy and reserved as I used to be. Boys never used to notice me before - but they sure do now.'

Low maintenance: Nicole didn't get to grips with make-up until she received some for her 18th birthday

Admiration: It wasn't until she started turning heads in the local pub that Nicole realised she was a beauty
