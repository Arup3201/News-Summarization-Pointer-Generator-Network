Scandal star Kerry Washington has revealed that she helped to design her own maternity wardrobe which covered up her growing baby bump during filming of the hit series.

The 37-year-old told Page Six that she and Scandal costume designer Lyn Paolo were forced to take matters into their own hands in order to create a range of clothing that would not only conceal Kerry’s pregnancy, but also remain in keeping with the sophisticated style of her character Olivia Pope.

‘It was really fun for Lyn and I, because there didn’t really exist a line out there… that was able to meet our needs in terms of the elevated level of fashion of Olivia Pope,’ she said.

'So we wound up inventing our own maternity wear and changing beautiful top-of-the-line clothes into maternity clothes,' she added.

Ms Washington, who continued to work throughout her pregnancy, gave birth to her daughter, Isabelle Amarachi, her first child with husband Nnamdi Asomugha in April.

While shooting season three of the hit political drama, the show's producers used strategically placed props such as lamps and phones to hide her baby bump. She could also be seen clutching large handbags in front of her belly.

While there's no word yet on whether Ms Washington will design a range of maternity wear for fans, she and Ms Paolo have already launched a Scandal-inspired clothing line, which debuted in September. The stylish collection, which was designed in collaboration with fashion brand the Limited, is aimed at helping fans to recreate Olivia Pope's signature style.

With 78 pieces priced from $49 to $250, the collection features pencil skirts, chic coats, print blouses, and a selection of work-ready pants.

The Limited described the clothing as 'sophisticated professional' with a neutral palette, tailored leg trousers and chic feminine blouses.

'This line is created so that everybody can find their own inner gladiator,' Ms Washington said at a launch event in September.

'That every woman can be powerful and sexy, brilliant and smart and gorgeous, fashion-forward. You know, it's just there's no limit to who you can be.'
