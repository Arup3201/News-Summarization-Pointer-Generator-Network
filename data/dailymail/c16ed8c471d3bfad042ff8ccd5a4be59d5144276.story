Streets covered in sand and straw, dirty-faced urchins on every corner and people's laundry hanging from fire escapes, no New York hasn't gone into free-fall following the election of a Democratic mayor, but a few blocks of the Lower East Side district have been transported back to the early part of the twentieth century.

The area has been transformed - literally overnight - to become the set for a new TV series, a period drama from Oscar-winning film director Steven Soderbergh. Filming will take place Thursday and Friday.

The Knick will look at the 
professional and personal lives of the doctors and nurses at the 
Knickerbocker Hospital in Harlem, set around 1900.

Several blocks of New York's Lower East Side district have been transported back to the early part of the 20th century to form the set for the new period drama

The shop fronts have all been replaced with signs more in keeping with the early 1900s, while there are old fashioned pants hanging off balconies

All signs of modern living have been removed such as bike racks and parking meters and the rest has been covered up with hay, dirt and dust.

The shop fronts have all been replaced with signs more in keeping with the early 1900s, while there are old fashioned pants hanging off balconies, reports Animal.

An estimated 300 extras in period costume have been spotted milling around the area, quite a sight to behold as they stare at their 21st century smartphones and swig from plastic water bottles between takes.

The 10-part Cinemax series is due on screens next year and will star 
British actor Clive Owen as a doctor addicted to liquid cocaine.

According to Cinemax, the show will 
focus on 'the groundbreaking surgeons, nurses and staff, who push the 
bounds of medicine in a time of astonishingly high mortality rates and 
zero antibiotics.'

The
set looks amazing, but some locals haven’t been best pleased to find 
their vehicles and bicycles moved without warning because they spoiled 
the aesthetic. 

One 
resident was so irked about the production’s temporary removal of 
bicycles, reports Bowery Boogie, that he left a handwritten response to 
the announcement of bike retrieval locations.

‘What if the bike owner doesn’t read English? You haven’t given 
him a clue that this is for him,' it read. 'That’s what happens when you come into a
neighborhood and take charge. Like checkpoint soldiers in Iraq who 
killed a whole family because they hadn’t learned the local hand signal 
for stop.’

Others have complained about how production company are treating the local area. One local business man told the Bowery Boogie blog that he had been offered just $250 per day compensation, but he claimed he was losing several times that amount.

‘While I support this amazing production to be offered $250 from the production company is an insult. We've lost $5,000 a day in business. And this is a multi-million dollar production. It's really outrageous how Hollywood gets away with this and it destroys struggling neighborhood businesses while this could have easily been re-constructed on a Hollywood backlot,’ wrote larrydacableguy.

After Ellis Island, the next stop for a great number of immigrants in the early 1900s was the small pocket of land near the Brooklyn Bridge along the East River, known as Manhattan's Lower East Side

In the early 1900s, the Lower East Side was the most overcrowded neighborhood in America.

From 1892 to 1934, between twelve and twenty million men, women, and children took their first steps onto American soil at Ellis Island. The next stop for a great number of these immigrants was the small pocket of land near the Brooklyn Bridge along the East River, known as Manhattan's Lower East Side.

On what had been farmlands, builders crammed three- and four-story row houses that could barely fit on the narrow strips of land that had been sectioned off for single-family dwellings.

These Lower East Side tenements were quickly filled and then overcrowded, housing more people than they were designed for. Many ethnic groups lived together in the area, including an enormous Jewish population, immigrants from Eastern Europe, and large contingencies from Ireland and Italy.

Many New York celebrities grew up on the Lower East Side, including Robert DeNiro, Zero Mostel, James Cagney, George Burns, and Jimmy Durante.

Today the population of the neighborhood is in transition. Latino and Chinese immigrants have settled in waves, but professionals are slowly gentrifying the neighborhood.

Some local businesses have complained about being offered $250 per day in compensation for the disruption and claim they are losing several times that amount
