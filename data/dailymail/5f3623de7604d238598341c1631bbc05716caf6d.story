Ferrari have opened the door for Ross Brawn to make a sensational return to the famous Italian constructor.

Brawn was an integral cog in the Ferrari winning machine at the turn of the century which saw Michael Schumacher storm to five consecutive Formula One titles.

But the Italian team are now 26 races without a victory - their longest winless streak in almost two decades - and only 10 points ahead of Williams in the battle for third in this year’s constructors’ championship.

Earlier this year, the likeable Stefano Domenicali resigned as team principal and was replaced by little-known Marco Mattiacci; a move which, on the face of it, appeared as a short-term fill, prompting suggestions Brawn could return. 

And speaking ahead of the team’s home race in Monza this weekend, Mattiacci reveals Ferrari would love to see Brawn back with the Prancing Horse.

‘Ross Brawn is an iconic figure at Maranello, said Mattiacci. ‘Everyone would like to have Ross or would like to see Ross back at Ferrari.’

Brawn was snapped up by Ferrari from Benetton where Schumacher won consecutive titles in 1994 and 1995.

He then established his own team from the ashes of Honda which saw Jenson Button storm to the 2009 title before helping to lay the foundations for Mercedes’ dominance this season.

Speaking to CNN’s, The Circuit, Mattiacci added: ‘He’s one of the most respected personalities in F1 with the highest knowledge and pedigree. Everybody would be happy with someone like Ross.’
