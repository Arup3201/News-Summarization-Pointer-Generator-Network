A married New Jersey police officer was arrested on Monday after being accused of exposing himself to young drivers during traffic stops and letting them go without a ticket.

Jason Miller, 37, allegedly exposed himself during 'numerous' traffic stops to 'satisfy his prurient interests,' says an affidavit.

After 'exposing himself' he is accused of letting drivers go without a ticket despite knowing that some of them had been drinking or that they had an expired registration.

The Smoking Gun reports that Miller, who is a father of two, was freed in $35,000 bail.

Charged: Jason Miller, 37, is accused of exposing himself to several young male drivers 

The New Jersey Herald reports that Miller, who has been a police officer since 2001, turned himself in to the Sussex County Prosecutors office on Monday and is suspended indefinitely without pay.

The affidavit details interactions with five men between the ages of 18 and 26 but police say that they have evidence of other, 'late night or early morning stops involving Officer Miller and young adult males…wherein it appears that Officer Miller’s pants were opened and/or his genitals were exposed and/or a zipper can be heard opening or closing.'

One of the alleged encounters occurred between Miller and an 18-year-old man who is identified at J.A.

J.A. told the Newton Police Department that he was stopped by Miller in September and that he observed something uncomfortable. 

J.A. says, 'he noticed the officer’s zipper was down and he saw what he believed to be the officer’s exposed genitals.'

Both J.A.'s driver registration and insurance has expired but Miller allegedly let the teen go without impounding his car.

The teen said that J.A's 'junk was hanging out'when telling the story to his girlfriend.

A 23-year-old driver identified as K.K said that he and a male friend were stopped by Officer Miller.

K.K. said that Miller asked him if he noticed the officer's 'zipper was down.'

The driver said, 'no' and when the traffic stop was over K.K. dropped his friend off at home and continued driving.

K.K. then realized that he was  being followed by Miller.

Miller allegedly drove beside K.K., asked him to roll down his window, and repeated the question about whether or not the teen has seen him open his fly.

K.K. then told the cop 'no,' once again.

Miller is then accused of asking the man if the boy he was dropping off was his boyfriend.

Suspended: Jason Miller has been suspended from the police department indefinitely without pay 

'K.K. told him no, and then told him that he has a girlfriend,' said the affidavit.

Miller then supposedly, ‘told him to have a good night and left the area.'

Police reviewed several videos of Miller's traffic stops.

In one of the videos of a 2:39am traffic stop, Miller's 'pants are open and his genitals are exposed' while he speaks with a 26-year-old driver.

The affidavit also states that Miller stopped a man in March who 'acknowledged he was coming from a bar and had consumed alcohol.'

Instead of Miller issuing a summons, he walked back to his car and 'you can hear what appears to be the sound of a zipper opening and/or closing,' according to the affidavit.
