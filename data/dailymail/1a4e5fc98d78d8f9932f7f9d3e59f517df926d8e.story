If you’re short of money, this might be the cashpoint for you – for it  is barely a couple of feet off  the ground.

The ATM has been installed outside a Sainsbury’s Local in Nottingham and, since it is the only one available outside the store, customers have been left with little choice but to use it.

It means they have to squat or kneel to get down to the level of the keypad.’

Low on funds?  You have to squat to use this cashpoint outside a Sainsbury's Local in Nottingham

Mystery: The cashpoint in Nottingham is at knee-level, far too low for wheelchair users

Musician Steve Drury, 27, was one of 
several who spotted the ATM and posted a picture on social media. ‘I 
couldn’t believe it,’ he said. ‘It was  just so low to the ground and a 
man using it was squatting to try to get  his money out.

‘The poor guy must have done his back in. It looked incredibly uncomfortable.’

Molly Kate Hancock commented on his post: 'This makes no sense!'

Sainsbury's were unable to shed any more light on the situation, saying merely that the cashpoint 'is located on a hill, which caused it to be built so low to the ground'.

When asked to clarify, a spokesman refused to explain further, saying merely: 'Our statement says it all'.

A spokesman for the nearby World of Mobility wheelchair and scooter shop said the ATM was far too low to have been installed with wheelchair users in mind.

No-one seems quite sure why the ATM is built so close to the ground, not even Sainsbury's themselves

People wanting to use the cashpoint have to bend double or squat to reach the buttons on the ATM

He said: 'Our wheelchairs are 30 inches up from the ground to the seat, which means the cashpoint would need to be at least 30 inches up, plus another 10 inches for someone to be able to reach the keys.'

The
 Sainsbury’s Finance ATM appears to be too low even for wheelchair 
users. A spokesman for World of Mobility, a local shop, said the 
cashpoint would need to be more than 3ft off the ground to be used 
comfortably.

A Sainsbury’s 
spokesman only added to the mystery yesterday by saying it was installed
 so low down because it is located on a hill.

Unable to clarify why the 
slope would affect its position, he said: ‘We have never had any 
customer complaints about this but we are looking at solutions to 
relocate it.
