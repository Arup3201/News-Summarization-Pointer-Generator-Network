After claiming that she would never have another surgical treatment again, cosmetic surgery addict Alicia Dovall was spotted last week with a 
bandaged and bloody face.

The swelling and stitches were a result of of a traumatic operation to have all her facial 
implants removed, a corrective procedure that she hopes will save her looks and return her ability to smile.

The painful procedure involved 
breaking her jaw and nose and having her ears cut off, but the ex-model has revealed in an interview with The Sun that she 
is determined to do whatever it takes to enable her to smile at baby 
daughter Papaya, as she urges other women to avoid cosmetic surgery.

Alicia Douvall is urging women to avoid plastic surgery as she reveals that her addition left her face so botched she couldn't even smile at her newborn baby

The heartbroken 34-year-old has revealed that her face had been so botched from surgery that she couldn't smile at her newborn when she gave birth in 2011.

Alicia, who has undergone over 350 procedures and spent £1.2million on surgery since the age of 17, has two daughters, Georgia, 17, and 16-month-old Papaya.

She told The Sun: ' Imagine holding 
your baby daughter for the for the first time and not being able to 
smile. I have been so selfish. Now my dream is for Papaya one day to see her mummy smile back at her for the first time.'

Alicia also admitted her guilt at 
forcing older daughter Georgia to miss an important GCSE exam so that she 
could babysit while Alicia underwent yet another procedure.

Last week the ex-model was seen with a swollen, bloodied face which was the result of a corrective operation to remove all of her facial implants

As
well as losing her once lovely looks and not being able to move her 
face naturally, Alicia is unable to drink normally, and is often in pain.

She
first went under the knife when she was 17, and since then has had six 
nose jobs, 11 procedures on the skin around her eyes, cheek implants 
(both adding and removal) and a facelift.

Alicia says she also had a rib shortened to give her a slimmer silhouette, her toes
shortened ‘so they looked better in heels’, a tummy tuck, bottom 
implants, chin implants and 16 breast augmentations.

Alicia believes that she has an 
addiction to surgery and blames the surgeons who allowed her to 
disfigure herself when she was such a pretty young women.

The glamour girl started having plastic surgery aged 17 and has spent over £1million on her addiction

Comparing herself to Katie Piper, the formal model who was disfigured in an acid 
attack, glamour girl Alicia says that her life has been ruined by 'attackers in white 
coats'.

Alicia says that 
she was blinded by the predatory surgeons who promised she would look 
'perfect' but instead turned her in to a walking sideshow.

She said: ‘I often used that word. I took a Barbie doll to one medical consultation to show 
them exactly what I was after.

'I
was unwell; addicted to surgery. But none of those doctors tried to 
stop me. I think they just wanted my money.'

Alicia, seen in 2001 (left) and photographed at home in London in March 2013 (right), has undergone over 350 operations including one to have her toes shortened

She needs to have one more corrective operation to stop her face drooping, but she is urging other women never to have plastic surgery just to make themselves look better

Her addiction saw her sometimes have an operation a week, and all available funds went on her quest for perfection.

She added: 'Apart
from my daughter’s education, I spent nothing on anything but surgery. I
ate beans on toast and never had a holiday. I even persuaded boyfriends
to pay for operations.

‘I’ve 
had so much surgery, my face doesn’t move. I can’t smile properly and 
can’t breathe through my nose. If I’d never had surgery, I’d be far 
better looking than I am now.’
