It was always going to be unwise naming a restaurant that glorifies unhealthy food the Heart Attack Grill.

And on Saturday the inevitable happened when a customer suffered a cardiac arrest in the chain's Las Vegas branch.

An onlooker captured video of paramedics wheeling the unidentified man, thought to be in his 40s, out of the fast-food diner.

He was midway through eating a 6,000-calorie Triple Bypass Burger when he began experiencing chest pains.

Living up to its name: A customer is wheeled out of the Heart Attack Grill restaurant in Las Vegas on Saturday night after suffering cardiac arrest

6,000 calories: The Triple Bypass Burger contains three slabs of meat, 12 rashes of bacon, cheese, red onion, sliced tomato and a 'unique special sauce'

The restaurant chain - founded in 2005 using the catchphrase 'Taste Worth Dying For!' - is run by a former nutritionist 'Doctor' Jon Basso who, remarkably, used to run a Jenny Craig weight loss diet centre.

He denied the incident was an elaborate publicity stunt.

Mr Basso told Fox News: 'The gentleman could barely talk. He was sweating, suffering.

'I actually felt horrible for him because the tourists were taking photos of him as if it were some type of stunt.

'Even with our own morbid sense of humour, we would never pull a stunt like that.'

The Heart Attack Grill sells calorie-laden fare with names such as Quadruple Bypass Burgers and Flatline Fries.

Controversial: The restaurant, which promises free food to the obese, is located on Sin City's Fremont Street

Meals can exceed 8,000 calories. The recommended daily intake is 2,000 calories for women and 2,500 for men.

The Triple Bypass Burger contains three slabs of meat, 12 rashes of bacon, cheese, red onion, sliced tomato and the Heart Attack Grill's own 'unique special sauce'. And that's before taking into account the accompanying 'Flatliner Fries', cooked in pure lard, and a giant soft drink.

Accentuating the medical theme, waitresses dressed as nurses deliver the artery-clogging food.

A sign at the entrance to an Arizona restaurant reads: 'Go away. If you come in this place, itâ€™s going to kill you.'

But the chain has provoked widespread anger with promotions including offering free food to morbidly obese customers.

In an exploitative advertising 
campaign, the restaurant announced that it would pick up the bill for 
any patron who weighed more than 25-stone.

Mr Basso hired a 46-stone man, Blair Rivers, to star in a tongue-in-cheek commercial promoting the special offer.

In
 the ad, Mr Basso says with a smile: 'I personally guarantee a stable 
upward progression of body weight while you're enjoying great tasting 
foods.

'Along with a cold beer and cigarette, it's a diet you can stick to for life.'

The
 advertisement then states the side affects from eating Heart Attack 
Grill food 'may include sudden weight gain, repeated increase of 
wardrobe size, back pain, male breast growth, loss of sexual partners, 
lung cancer, tooth decay and liver sclerosis stroke.

'In some cases mild death may occur.'
