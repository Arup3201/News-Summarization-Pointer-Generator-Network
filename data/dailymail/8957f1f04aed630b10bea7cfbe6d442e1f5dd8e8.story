He often has to fight his corner as the junior partner in the Coalition.

So when Nick Clegg was asked what he would like for Christmas from his wife Miriam, he was quick to answer – a pair of boxing gloves. In Liberal Democrat yellow, of course.

But rather than use the gloves on his ministerial colleagues, the Deputy Prime Minister needs them for the kickboxing classes he now does every week as a way to ‘get stuff out of my system’.

During  his LBC show Nick Clegg said he had asked for boxing gloves as a Christmas present from his wife

Practice sessions allow him to imagine he is delivering a blow to a Westminster foe – although he won’t reveal who.

He currently uses ‘slightly smelly’ gloves supplied by the gym he attends near his south west London home, so he hopes to be treated to a pair of his own.

While he was happy to reveal the preferred colour - yellow - he refused to reveal who he imagined punching

Speaking on a festive edition of LBC radio’s Call Clegg programme, to be broadcast on Christmas Day, Mr Clegg said he knew his choice of present would be a gift to satirists.

He told the show’s host Nick Ferrari: ‘This is so going to be misinterpreted – but I’ve actually asked for a pair of boxing gloves.

‘Not to wear them in the House of Commons, although come to think about it, maybe I should. It’s because once a week, I go to a gym and... I do these exercises.’

He said his preferred colour was ‘yellow, of course’.

Asked who he imagined fighting, he added: ‘I sometimes imagine people who will remain nameless.’

Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘I didn’t know he did boxing once a week – is it called the Cabinet? I hope he’ll be using them on Vince Cable, that would be a good start.’

Mr Clegg is said to have lost around a stone in weight after stepping up his fitness regime and starting a more healthy diet.

He recommended kickboxing as good workout, saying: ‘I love it. It’s very good fun... it gets stuff out of my system.

‘I’m not any good at it, but it’s incredibly good exercise.’

A source said the Lib Dem leader has always tried to go to the gym once a week but has been working on his fitness for several months.

A trainer introduced him to kickboxing, which he now does as part of his regular exercise routine.  

‘He’s stepped up the regime since the summer, and been more conscious of being active and eating healthily,’ the aide said.

‘Those who work closely with him would say there’s been a sizeable change,’ he said, adding that Mr Clegg had ‘no plans’ to compete in a boxing ring.

The Lib Dem leader also delivered his Christmas message to the public from London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital yesterday, saying it is a time for ‘hope, kindness, family and goodwill.’
