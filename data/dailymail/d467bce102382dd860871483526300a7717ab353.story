A young beauty blogger has posted a shocking photo diary of what happened when she suffered a severe reaction to a salon facial.

Singaporean make-up fanatic Juli, who blogs under the name Bun Bun at bunbunmakeuptips.com, shared her experience online in a series of blog posts, documenting how the skin on her face became enraged by the treatment and then by medication she was given by a dermatologist in effort to calm it down.

Writing four days after her 'skin-ravaging facial', Juli warned readers with a caution: 'This post contains graphic images of a face
inflamed with red, angry pimples filled with pus.'

She continued: 'You might feel itchy
and want to vomit after seeing these images. I totally understand if 
you run away from me if you saw me. Reader discretion advised.'

She then posted a photograph of what she usually looks like, followed by a day-by-day photographic account of how her skin reacted to the facial, first breaking out in a small number of spots, which rapidly grew in number and filled with pus.

She visited a clinic to have the pus extracted, which only served tomake the condition worse. The spots were soon covering her entire face and neck, and were both painful and itchy.

Writing on the site, Juli commented: 'I'd sent images of my deteriorating skin condition to the people at the facial salon and they asked me to go down and have the pus extracted again, this time to their HQ, where their Director was around.

'I don't know how people who have been in the industry for THIRTY YEARS couldn't tell this was not your normal acne breakout or post-facial sensitivity.'

She continued: 'The facial people told me that "It has to get worse before it gets better". BULL***T. Anyone who tells you that about your skin is really just lying to you. I have friends who are aestheticians say there's no such thing. If it gets worse, it can only get worse.

'From the first round of extraction, they kept lying to me that "tomorrow your skin will be better". It never did. At home, my skin turned worse.'

Despite their advice, Juli chose not to reveal the name of the salon, believing they did not intend to cause the reaction.

The clusters of spots around Juli's chin continued to grow and grow

The skin on her forehead began to break out in a pus-filled rash as well

Juli visited a number of doctors, and the second one gave her pills and told her the skin allergy should not cause any scarring, but would leave her  with hyper-pigmentation for at least a few months.

She said: 'He also advised that I go back to my skincare regime before the facial because the new products given by the salon might be contributing to the allergy.'

Juli said the whole experience left her traumatised and depressed

After the photographs Juli wrote: 'I'm sorry if I scared you. I have goosebumps too. You can't imagine how difficult it was to look at these photos and not cry. I cry the most when I’m washing my face.

'My self-confidence has plummeted to rock bottom. I cannot remember the last time I was so depressed over an external condition.

'I guess I could thank the heavens that I’m lucky to be alive, but can my life ever go back to normal? I don't know. It's a great fall to take for a person who is image-conscious and with an online personality.'

In a second blog post a few days later, she wrote: 'I was at my lowest on Day 5. A small percentage of the pustules were starting to dry out, but more were forming, and they were MERGING. They were spreading to my neck too, and were incredibly itchy.'

Juli added that she has not only lost out financially as a result of her reaction, but that when she attended the Singapore blogging awards as a finalist she was forced to wear a mask over her face because she was so embarrassed.

The pustules showed no sign of abating on day five

On day six, after lots of medication, the spots began to dry up

The doctor told Juli she should expect to have discolouration of the skin for several months

Juli ends her post saying: 'I realize I have instilled panic and fear in many people regarding the effects of a facial.

'Many have asked me to advise on whether this salon is safe to go, whether the one I went to is the one they are going to, what to look out for in a facial, etc.

'I wrote about my personal experience to share the risks involved in getting a facial. I do not know and cannot guarantee what will happen to anybody else.

'You may or may not be allergic to the products the salon uses, the treatment may or may not be right for you, your beauticians may or may not know what to do when they see you with uncommon pus on your face, facials may or may not work for you at all.

'I cannot speak for anyone and am not qualified to say whether or not a facial or a trip to a dermatologist is right for you.

'I have been going for facials for the past ten years and as a beauty blogger tried a myriad of products on my skin, and NOTHING like that has ever happened.'
