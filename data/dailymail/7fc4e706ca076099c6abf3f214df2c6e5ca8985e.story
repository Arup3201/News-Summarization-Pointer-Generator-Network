Pope Francis waded into Middle East peace-making this evening by welcoming both the Israeli and Palestinian presidents to the Vatican for an evening of prayers.

Israeli President Shimon Peres was the first to arrive at the Vatican hotel where Pope Francis lives, followed by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.

Francis warmly greeted both and met privately with each one before heading out to the Vatican garden for the service.

Their meeting came just weeks after the last round of peace negotiations, sponsored by the U.S.,Â  collapsed.

Vatican officials have insisted Pope Francis has no political agenda by inviting the two leaders to pray at 
his home other than to rekindle a desire for peace among the two 
parties.

However, the meeting could have significance on the ground beyond 
mere symbolism.

The meeting will also cement Francis' 
reputation as a leader unhindered by diplomatic and theological protocol
 who is willing to go out on a limb for the sake of peace.

'In the Middle East, symbolic gestures and incremental steps are important,' noted the Rev. Thomas Reese, a veteran Vatican analyst for the National Catholic Reporter.

'And who knows what conversations can occur behind closed doors in the Vatican.'

The unusual prayer summit was a feat of diplomatic and religious protocol, organized in the two weeks since Francis issued the surprise invitation to Peres and Abbas from Manger Square in Bethlehem.

It took place in the Vatican gardens 
in the shadow of St. Peter's Basilica, the most religiously neutral 
place in the tiny city-state.

It incorporated Jewish, Christian and Muslim prayers - delivered in Hebrew, English, Arabic and Italian.

The
 prayers focused on three themes common to each of the religions: 
thanking God for creation, seeking forgiveness for past wrongdoing and 
praying to God to bring peace to the region.

Francis,
 Peres and Abbas were expected to deliver brief remarks, shake hands and
 plant an olive tree together in a sign of peace.

The spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians was also present to give a united Christian front.

Vatican officials have described the prayer evening as something of a 'time-out' in political negotiations, merely designed to rekindle the desire for peace through prayers common to all the main faith traditions in the Holy Land.

But even Francis' secretary of state, 
Cardinal Pietro Parolin, has said the power of prayer shouldn't be 
discounted for its ability to change the reality on the ground.

'Prayer
 has a political strength that we maybe don't even realize and should be
 exploited to the full,' he said at the end of Francis' trip.

'Prayer has the ability to transform hearts, and thus to transform history.'

That
 said, no concrete results are expected: Peres has no formal role in 
peace negotiations, holds a largely ceremonial post and leaves office at
 the end of the month.

But Nadav Tamir, a political adviser 
to Peres, said Sunday the Israeli government authorized the trip and 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in 'constant contact' with
 Peres.

Speaking on Israeli
 Army Radio, Tamir stressed the meeting was not political, even though 
he said Peres and Abbas were expected to discuss political developments 
when they meet in private after the prayer.

Netanyahu
 had urged the world to shun Abbas' new unity government which took 
office last week because it is backed by the Islamic militant group 
Hamas. His pleas have been ignored by the West, with both the U.S. and 
the European Union saying they will give the unity government a chance.

Peres' participation thus undermines 
Netanyahu's attempts to isolate the Palestinians, and instead adds to 
the growing isolation of Netanyahu's hard-line position.

Netanyahu's office has declined repeated requests for comment about the Vatican summit.

Nevertheless, Tamir stressed that the meeting had a different aspect to it.

He said: 'The government of Israel decided not to hold political negotiations, but we aren't talking about political negotiations.

'We are talking about a different gesture, a spiritual gesture, an act of public diplomacy.'

Abbas told Italian daily La Repubblica that Francis' invitation was 'an act of great courage'

'Nothing should stop us in the search for solutions so that both of our people can live in their own sovereign state,' he was quoted as saying in Sunday's editions.
