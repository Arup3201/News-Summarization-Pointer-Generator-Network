England are heading to a World Cup in Australia and New Zealand with all the attention on their captain and his form — and that’s worrying.

The issue with Alastair Cook I’m afraid is the same as it was last summer. I said then I was concerned that the captaincy came at the expense of his best form and it is particularly relevant in one-day cricket ahead of the World Cup.

We are talking about a world-class batsman, a player whose stats stood comparison with Sachin Tendulkar’s at the same age, but one who has now failed to score a century in 59 innings in all cricket for England.

If Cook was a Mike Brearley-type figure as a leader you might understand England’s desire to keep him at the helm in Test and one-day cricket, but is it worth sacrificing his batting so that he can be an ‘OK’ captain?

Cook is a fighter and wants to prove people wrong again and you have to admire that. The loyalty of the selectors is admirable in many ways, too, but it has led to issues, not least whether the captain is worth his place in the side.

In the last one-day international in Sri Lanka, for instance, Cook would have had to go up to Ravi Bopara and tell him he was leaving him out. But Ravi could have been forgiven for thinking: ‘Hang on, why are you still in the side?’

If the World Cup were in the sub-continent there is no way Cook should be captain — it is all too obvious what would happen to him in Sri Lanka — but as it’s in Australia and New Zealand he might do reasonably well.

It is whether it is enough in the modern world of one-day cricket for England to reach the latter stages and as it stands the selectors are simply left hoping that it will be ‘all right on the night’.

It would not be too much of a gamble to replace him now. It should have happened months ago, of course, and more dynamic players should have been given time to bed into the side, but England do not have much to lose now. It is a question of whether they want to rock the boat and hurt the captain they have put such store in by admitting they were wrong and giving the captaincy to Eoin Morgan or, at a push, Joe Root.

It’s understandable that the focus should be on Cook, but that does mask a lot of problems that are just as serious as his lack of runs.

Morgan’s form is key among them. He is such an important player, England’s most important batsman in the one-day game, but his form has in many ways been worse than Cook’s and that’s a huge concern.

If England are going to have any chance at this World Cup they simply have to have Morgan at his best because he is vital to them reaching the scores of 300-plus that are going to be required.

The captaincy seems to have brought something like the best out of him in recent times so maybe that would galvanise him now, but if it is not to be that, then England have to sit Morgan down and work through what’s wrong.

To me, though, the bowling is an even bigger worry than the batting because England are lacking wicket-takers in this form of the game.

They are pointing to Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson coming back — but hang on a minute. Broad has traditionally taken time to work his way back to his best after injury, while if the white ball does not swing, Anderson may struggle for wickets.

If England do not take wickets they will always be chasing more than 300 in this World Cup — or will have to try to set that, and then we come back to whether the batting is dynamic enough to reach those heights.

These problems, of course, are nothing new. We put Test cricket first in this country and that means that predominantly Test batsmen in myself, Michael Vaughan and Andrew Strauss have been in charge for the last three World Cups.

Perhaps the selectors wanted to stay loyal to their Test leaders on those occasions, too, and we were all grateful about it at the time —but it didn’t work for us all then and you have to say the odds are against it working for England now.

When I helped compile the Schofield Report seven years ago, we were saying one-day cricket should be treated just as seriously as Test cricket and I see that Paul Downton was saying the same thing this week. Well, if England really mean it this time then they have to put faith in the younger, more dynamic batsmen who have grown up with Twenty20.

Why, for instance, has it taken them so long to get James Taylor in the side when he has consistently delivered the goods at a high level of domestic one-day cricket?

Alex Hales may have been ‘found out’ to an extent but England have to be bold and back their one-day players with the same loyalty they have shown their Test players.

That means understanding that the peaks and troughs are more extreme with younger players and understanding that they must be given a decent run in the side to show that they can adapt and grow into international cricket.

As it is, Test batsmen who play so much international cricket that they don’t have time to work on their one-day skills are having to do just that with a World Cup on the horizon, and that’s all wrong. The fact that Cook is still having to work out his best way to play spin in one-day cricket is a disgrace.

England’s best Test players, such as Cook and Ian Bell, do not play enough white-ball cricket either domestically or around the world, and that means they are standing still while other nations are enhancing their one-day skills.

Another recommendation of the Schofield Report was that the calendar should be changed to avoid World Cups following Ashes series and while that has been done this time I can’t think of worse preparation than a seven-match, 50-over series in Sri Lanka.

All that was ever going to do was show up England’s shortcomings and affect their confidence, which is exactly what has happened. It would have been far better if all England’s players had gone off to play in the Big Bash in Australia — if they had been able to get contracts — because that is the type of limited-overs cricket that England must play if they are ever to make an impact.

As it is, we are still far too ‘English’ in the way we play one-day cricket and it is difficult to see that being the way forward at this World Cup. With or without Alastair Cook in charge.
