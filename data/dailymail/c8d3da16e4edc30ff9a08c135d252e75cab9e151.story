A teenager who went out for a street fight armed with a knife has avoided jail – but boasted of his ‘Ankle Rolex’ after being given an electronic tag by a judge.

Calvin Saward, 18, was baited by former friends who called him asking for a scrap outside his home in Herne Bay, Kent, and grabbed a knife to confront the gang.

But his father disarmed him before any fight could take place and called police. Then, at Canterbury Crown Court last week, he was ordered him to stay indoors overnight for the next four weeks.

After the case, Saward posted a picture on Facebook of his electronic tag, which he labelled ‘Ankle Rolex’, adding: ‘Want to pull this thing off already. Lesson learned? Don’t play with knives.’

Judge Heather Norton said the father’s actions last December prevented the incident from escalating. And Phil Rowley, defending, said: ‘His dad should be commended for his behaviour.’

The judge told Saward: ‘What you did was a very stupid act. It was not just stupid; it was also dangerous - not just to others but also to yourself.

‘People who take knives on to the street should realise the consequences could be fatal. There is a lot of concern about young people arranging fights and then taking knives with them.

‘I know you were confronted by a larger group, but you could have stayed inside.

‘Your father’s action in taking that knife away and calling the police may have landed you in court, but probably prevented something more serious from occurring.’

Possessing a knife in public usually results in an immediate jail term, but the judge gave the teenager a community order.

She also took the unusual step of refusing to issue a destruction order for the weapon and returned the kitchen knife to the father, who was present at the court.
