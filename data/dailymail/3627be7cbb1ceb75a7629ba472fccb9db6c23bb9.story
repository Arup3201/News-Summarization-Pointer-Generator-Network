Through a neighbor who translated for him, Mr Alterma said he was driving when he pressed the brakes of the vehicle, and it just shifted and he lost control.

Mr Alterma's wife was in the passenger seat of the vehicle when the accident occurred.

'His wife was very hysterical, and she was very upset about the whole thing,' witness Joseph Gougre said.

Miami police say Mr Alterma was not wearing his glasses, and this may have led to him losing control of the vehicle. They believe speed may have been another factor.

Officials also say the restaurant did not have the proper permit for an outdoor cafe.
