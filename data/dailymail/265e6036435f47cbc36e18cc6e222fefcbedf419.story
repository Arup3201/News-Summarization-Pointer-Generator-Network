Jason Deller is likely to be questioned further by police over the violent behaviour towards his two young children while at a suburban cafe in Queensland

An aspiring Queensland politician caught on camera pouring a jug of cold water over his baby son before slapping another child in the head, may not get off scot free after all, with police confirming to Daily Mail Australia that the incident was 'definitely under review'.

And just moments after the police revelation, an emotional Jason Deller announced he would withdraw from the election.

The violent and bizarre behaviour by the former Independent candidate, took place inside a cafe in the suburb of Buddina, in full view of other patrons.

But, despite reports to the contrary earlier, it was confirmed on Friday afternoon by the Child Protection Investigation Unit that even though the issue 'is quite political at the moment, it is definitely under review'.

The confronting CCTV footage shows Mr Deller pouring water from a jug over his baby boy's head and then slap his toddler son across the front of the head, before pulling the baby out of the high chair and storming out of the eatery on Sunday morning.

Following the shocking incident, there was a backlash against the aspiring politician social media; including comments like 'QLD Police have some serious explaining to do as to why he wasn't charged? This is clear child abuse' and 'Yeah, people do smack their kids, I know it's seen as wrong these days .. but over the head?! Look how young his son is..'

The father-of-four and award-winning engineer succumbed to the intense public pressure and announced he would withdraw from Saturday's ballot, saying 'I am completely devastated about how the event has been presented in public'.

Australia's leading child protection advocate, Hetty Johnston, told the Daily Mail that Mr Deller should 'do the right thing and withdraw'.

'It's disgraceful – I think every voter in the electorate in which he represents should be very aware of whether or not they want to vote for someone with the capacity to treat children in that manner,' she added.

'We don't need people like that representing us in parliament, leave him off the ballot, it's not acceptable.

'He's done this in public and probably thought he wouldn't be caught. 

'Any right-minded thinking person should not vote for him.'

Mr Deller stood down on Friday afternoon, reading from a written statement, he said: 'Last Sunday whilst having breakfast with my wife and family at a café in Buddina on the Sunshine Coast, a series of very challenging events led me to become frustrated and upset with the behaviour of my three year old son.'

'Unfortunately I reacted inappropriately and gave him a clip over his ear. I sincerely apologise to my son, and wife and to those who witnessed this incident.

'The incident was part of a series of a very challenging events which we had to deal with on Sunday morning, not unlike any other day with a child who has behavioural issues.

'As many parents know, it is sometimes very hard to discuss these issues outside of friends and existing support services that we confidentially engage to support me and our family.

'As a father, I work hard to provide the love and support that young people need to grow up as happy and healthy adults.'

He continued, saying: 'I am completely devastated by how this event has been presented in public but fully understand my responsibilities as a male and father to ensure the safety and care of my family and children. We will continue to work with our family and support services.'

'I entered this campaign to make a difference in the community, however out of respect for the community perception and well-being of my family, I intend to withdraw my candidacy as an Independent for Kawana at the election tomorrow.

'I will devote my time to continuing to nurture my beautiful family and regain our strength as a family and will help the community wherever possible.'

He had posted on his Facebook page, earlier this week, praising all election candidates who are also juggling parenthood.'My hat off to all politicians running for election who have children,' the post said.

On Mr Deller's website, he attributed his decision to run in the Queensland state election to his 'amazing wife and four beautiful children' who are his 'greatest delight in life'.

But the surveillance video shows the Engineering Your Life founder can be seen casually walking over to his infant son sitting in a high chair and pouring cold water from the jug all over the small baby.

While Mr Deller walks away to put the jug back - his toddler son, who is standing on his chair, begins to climb on the table before pouring out his drink from a cup onto the floor.

His father witnesses the behaviour and walks over to the young boy and swiftly smacks him across the head, so hard that the stunned youngster slides down off the table. 

Mr Deller pulls then proceeds to pull his baby son out of the high chair and walk out of the cafe.

His wife, who is seated at the table throughout the entire incident, finishes her meal before picking up her toddler son to follow her husband out of the cafe, much to the astonishment of the other diners. 

A diner recognised the aspiring politician and called the police who spoke with Mr Deller but, as yet, no charges have been laid.

The incident comes as Mr Deller praised all election candidates who are also parents on his Facebook page

Queensland treasurer Tim Nicholls said police had investigated the incident.

'Of course any action such as that that is reported is unbecoming and it's unlawful,' he said.

Mr Deller had previously said such incidents could be seen in parks daily and he wouldn't be surprised if it occurred in most family homes but added that he did not condone such behaviour

'The matter is a delicate issue, but there is nothing more to follow up – that's the end of it,' he had told The Courier Mail.

'Things get reported differently to the way they actually happened. This has completely been taken out of context.' 

Mr Deller said at the time police were taking no further action but a note would be placed on his record. Authorities have since revealed that the incident is under review.

'My wife's very upset and said that if this is what being in public life's like, then perhaps I shouldn't pursue it.' 

Mr Deller was planning to take on Attorney-General Jarrod Bleijie in the seat of Kawana in this Saturday's Queensland state election.
