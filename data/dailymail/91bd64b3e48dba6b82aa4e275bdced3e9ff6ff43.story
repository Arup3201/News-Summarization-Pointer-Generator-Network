MP for the Northern Tablelands Adam Marshall was caught drink-driving on Friday night

A 29-year-old MP has called himself a 'bloody idiot' after being caught drink-driving.

NSW parliamentarian Adam Marshall was stopped by police while driving home from a night out with friends on Friday in Glen Innes, Northern Tablelands, in northern New South Wales.

He allegedly blew a mid-range reading of 0.112 at about 10.45pm after being stopped by police during a random breath analysis.

The state MP, who began his political career at the age of 19, said in a statement that he deeply regretted his actions.

'Although I thought I was ok to drive, I wasn't. I drank and drove â€“ I was a bloody idiot,' he said

'I would like to sincerely apologise to the community, my friends and family for my actions.'

NSW Nationals leader Andrew Stoner has also commented on the incident.

'Earlier today, I was informed that the MP for the Northern Tablelands, Adam Marshall, was last night caught driving under the influence of alcohol,' he said.

'I have since expressed to Adam my disappointment with his actions, and reiterated the high standards that I expect of all our MPs.'

Mr Marshall is not the first Tablelands MP to attract scandal.

He claimed the seat at a 2013 by-election sparked by the resignation of Richard Torbay, who held the Northern Tablelands as an independent for 14 years.

NSW Nationals leader Andrew Stoner confirmed the incident and expressed his 'disappointment'

Mr Torbay resigned last March - a day after the Nationals dumped him as their candidate for the federal seat of New England.

He was subsequently referred to the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption because of his relationship with crooked ex-Labor powerbroker Eddie Obeid.

Mr Stoner said Mr Marshall had resigned as temporary Speaker and Deputy Chair of the State and Regional Development Committee.

But Mr Marshall, who will appear in Glen Innes local court on July 15, has promised: 'I will continue to work as hard as ever for the people of Northern Tablelands and carry on my work advancing our issues and needs.'
