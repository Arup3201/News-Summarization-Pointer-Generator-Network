Ukip's general election campaign descended into chaos this morning after internal party rows over policy spilled out into the open.

The party's health spokesman Louise Bours publicly slapped down party leader Nigel Farage after he suggested the NHS may need to be privatised to cope with the growing pressure on the health budget caused by a rapidly-ageing population.

It came after the Ukip MEP in charge of writing the party's 2015 manifesto was replaced – after not coming up with any policies.

Nigel Farage has admitted he would be forced to resign if Britain voted to stay in the European Union in a referendum.

The Ukip leader said it would be 'curtains' for him and his colleagues if the country rejected the chance to cut ties with Brussels.

David Cameron has promised a referendum on Britain's membership if the Conservatives form the next government.

Mr Farage said: 'The loss of a referendum means curtains for Nigel and it means curtains for the current crowd here in head office.'

It comes after Mr Farage last year vowed to resign as party leader if the party fails to achieve a general election breakthrough.

He said: 'If we'd failed in the European elections I would have stood down, if we fail next year the party will pick someone better than me, but do you know what? That ain't going to happen.'

Tim Aker was replaced as the Ukip policy chief after failing to complete the party's manifesto in time for May's crunch general election, senior party figures have confirmed.

The revelation emerged after Mr Farage sparked controversy by claiming that privatising large parts of the NHS was 'a debate that we're all going to have to return to' if the health service was going to stay affordable.

Within hours of the remarks Ukip's Health Spokesman, Louise Bours, insisted Mr Farage was out of touch with the public when it came to the NHS.

She said: 'Nigel is entitled to his opinion and others are entitled to theirs, we don’t whip people into all thinking the same thing, like the establishment parties.

'As he has said before, he raised the idea for discussion a while ago, the party discussed at and rejected it.

'I am certain that if the party discuss it again, we will reject it again. The vast majority of Ukip members, the British public and I will always favour a state funded NHS.'

The rows come just over three months before the general election in which Ukip is hoping to increase the number of MPs into double figures.

But Mr Farage himself is facing a battle to be elected in Thanet South, where he is currently trailing the Conservative candidate Craig Mackinlay by up to five points in the polls.

His election bid was also dealt a blow after stand-up comic Al Murray announced he would stand against Mr Farage as his TV character 'The Pub Landlord'.

The revelation that Mr Aker – one of the party's bright young hopes – has failed to complete the party's manifesto in time in a fresh embarrassment for the party which has previously acknowledged that it needs to professionalise its operation.

According to the Times, Ukip had set the beginning of January as the deadline to agree its election policies.

The manifesto would then be sent off to be checked and costed by an independent think-tank.

Senior party figures had become increasingly concerned that Mr Aker, 29, was struggling to complete the final draft of the manifesto on time.

A senior Ukip insider said: 'There was growing disquiet that none of us had seen hide nor hair on the policy front. It was especially annoying for candidates, who are banned from making any specific pledges before the manifesto is published.

'They don't know what to tell voters on the doorstep.'

Ukip's deputy chairman Suzanne Evans has now been drafted in to finish the manifesto.

She said: 'Tim Aker was responsible for running our policy programme, but as an MEP, borough councillor and PPC [prospective parliamentary candidate] for the target seat of Thurrock he stepped down from the role of policy chief.

'I relish the task of putting together the final details and presenting a sensible, radical and fully costed manifesto at our spring conference in Margate.'

A Ukip spokesman this morning insisted it was untrue that Mr Aker had been 'sacked'. He said: 'It's bunkum. When he was elected as a borough councillor he said he couldn't do it any more. The handover was over the weekend of the ninth, tenth, eleventh of this month.

'The manifesto was always supposed to be ready for the conference next month.' 

Ukip has insisted its manifesto will commit to protecting the NHS as a free-to-use taxpayer-funded service.

But Mr Farage has insisted that the idea of replacing the NHS with an insurance-based system is 'a debate that we're all going to have to return to'.

He said: 'There is no question that healthcare provision is going to have to be very much greater... and we're going to have to find ways to do it.'

Last year a video emerged from 2012 in which Mr Farage proposed an 'insurance-based system of healthcare'.

He had been recorded saying: 'Frankly, I would feel more comfortable that my money would return value if I was able to do that through the marketplace of an insurance company than just us trustingly giving £100bn a year to central government and expecting them to organise the healthcare service from cradle to grave for us.'

Mr Farage said: 'I triggered a debate within UKIP that was outright rejected by my colleagues, so I have to accept that.

'As time goes on, this is a debate that we're all going to have to return to.'

But in his latest interview Mr Farage insisted that the way the NHS is run will have to change to care for Britain's ageing population.

He said: 'There is no question that healthcare provision is going to have to be very much greater in ten years than it is today, with an ageing population, and we're going to have to find ways to do it.'

Andy Burnham, Labour's Shadow Health Secretary, said Mr Farage's comments 'confirmed that a vote for Ukip is a vote for the privatisation of the NHS and for a full American healthcare system'.

He said: 'Farage admits he says one thing in public about the NHS but another behind closed doors. He has shown UKIP's statements on protecting the NHS to be hollow.

'UKIP claim to stand up for working people, but in reality they are more Tory than the Tories. Farage will never be able to distance himself from his real views. He should be honest with the public.'
