The Pet Shop Boys are set to swap the bright lights of the West End for the rolling hills of Ambridge to make a surprise appearance on the Archers.

The band – Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe – will arrive as last-minute headliners for the rural soap's fictional music festival Loxfest this weekend, after the original act drops out.

Festival organiser Roy Tucker will reveal the news backstage.  

Change of tempo? Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe of the Pet Shop Boys will arrive as last minute headliner's

The duo, whose hits include It's A Sin, Go West and Heart, said: 'It's a thrill for us to enter the world of The Archers, the UK's most famous radio drama.'

They are joined on the show by Radio 6 Music DJ Steve Lamacq who is heard organising the festivities of the fictional festival.

He said: 'Loxfest is the Archers storyline we've been waiting for. 

'As someone who spends a lot of time covering festivals for the BBC, it was one we really wanted to be involved with.

'So when we first heard the rumours about the festival at the start of the year we offered up our services, helping to suggest bands that might fit the bill. 

'I'd have probably have gone down and helped them put up the security fencing if they'd asked.

'I've been a fan of The Archers off and on for more than a decade, but got hooked again about three years ago. 

'You'd be surprised how many Archers fans there are in the music industry. 

'Even the former stage manager at Reading Festival would come up to me and ask to borrow my pocket radio when the Archers omnibus came on.'

The Archers, which started out as an educational programme for farmers, is recorded in Birmingham and set in the fictional nearby village of Ambridge.

Previous guest stars include the Duchess of Cornwall, Princess Margaret and Sir Bradley Wiggins.
