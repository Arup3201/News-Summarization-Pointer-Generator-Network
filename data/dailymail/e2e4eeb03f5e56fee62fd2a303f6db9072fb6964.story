Caroline Wozniacki got male deuces flowing on Monday as she stepped out in New York's Herald Square to reveal her inclusion in this year's Sports Illustrated Swimsuit edition.

Wozniacki, who split from ex-fiance Rory McIlroy last year, served up a treat as she swapped her tennis whites for something a little skimpier. 

Wozniacki was not the only sports star to slip on the beach wear as she appears alongside UFC women’s bantamweight champion Ronda Rousey.

Despite losing out to former women's No 1 Victoria Azarenka in the second round of the Australian Open earlier this year, the tennis-star-turned-model returned to the women's top five for the first time since March 2012.

Also featured in this year's edition is Irina Shayk, former girlfriend of Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo, Stephanie Bertram Rose, girlfriend of Paris Saint Germain right back Gregory van der Wiel,  and American model Gigi Hadid. Hannah Davis, girlfriend of former New York Yankees star Derek Jeter, is has bagged the coveted cover shot this year.

24-year-old Wozniacki took to Twitter on Monday to express her feelings about being included in the famous swimwear glossy: 'Excited to be included in the 2015 Edition,' she wrote.

We wonder if McIlroy will be popping down to his local newsagents for a quick flick through.
