Most people associate the splicing of one vehicle with another as a cut-and-shut technique used by dodgy car salesmen.

But a section of a massive cruise ship has been inserted into another older liner to create a shiny new ship 99 feet longer than before.

And the amazing process of creating the stretch cruise liner has been caught on cameras by time-lapse photography experts.

Scroll down for video

The new 99ft section of the cruise ship was lined up alongside the original ship, which had been sawn in two and then carefully inserted in the gap (pictured)

The cruise ship, originally named the Norwegian Crown, is seen being towed backwards into a dry dock in the Blohm + Vosss shipyard in Hamburg, where it is then cut in half.

The two sections of the ship are slowly moved apart to make room for the extra 99ft section to make the new ship much longer, Sploid reported.

Positioned by the ship’s side, the vast new metal section is carefully moved into place to effectively create a ‘stretch’ cruise ship.

The new section is welded into place and the ship is then repainted so that its new section blends seamlessly into it.

The altered ship leaves the yard as the Balmoral and the whole painstaking process conducted by highly skilled engineers, has been captured by slow motion specialists MK Timelapse.

The Balmoral vessel is owned and operated by Fred Olsen Cruise Lines and was built in 1988, so in an age of even larger cruise ships, the cut-and-shut operation gives the vessel a new lease of life.

The Enchantment of the Seas was refurbished and extended in 2008

It is relatively common practice for cruise ships to be extended in this way.

In 2008 another ship called the Enchantment of the Seas was refurbished to add extra rooms.

It originally measured 916ft long and was extended by 73ft.

The overhaul cost in the region of £30million, but was a fraction of the £500million cost of building a new cruise ship.

The work provided 151 more cabins and added new facilities, including trampolines and a swimming pool.

The painstaking process took place in a dry dock at the Keppel Verolme shipyard in Rotterdam, Holland.
