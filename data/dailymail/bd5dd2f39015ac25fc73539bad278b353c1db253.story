The father of the Georgia high school student who died after he got trapped inside a roll of wrestling mats believes his son was murdered, it was revealed today.

Lowndes High School student Kendrick Johnson, 17, became lodged inside the roll of mats, upside down, Lowndes County sheriff's officials have said.

His body was found Friday morning in the high school's old gym after his family reported him missing Thursday night.

Life cut short: Johnson was found Friday after going missing a day earlier.

Initial reports said Johnson fell in after he reached for a shoe but authorities have not yet made an official determination.

'It's an open investigation,' said Lt. Stryde Jones from the Lowndes County 
Sheriff's Office.

'We are interviewing students and reviewing 
school security cameras.'

Johnson's father, Kenneth Johnson, said his son was murdered.

'I want to express how did my son go missing during school hours in broad
daylight?

'We know our son was murdered while he was at Lowndes High 
School. We do know that,' he told a local television station.

The father is having a difficult time dealing with the passing of his son.

'How can you go on when you have a beloved child who wakes up everybody 
in the house and makes a laugh out of everything, how can you go on? 
It's hard.'

The teen's aunt, Anastasia Roe, said her nephew was a good student but ran into problems with another student last year, FoxNews.com reported.

Grief: Johnson's father says its 'hard' moving on after his beloved son died.

But an autopsy found no signs of a struggle, officials said.

It is possible Johnson may have been reaching for a shoe that had fallen into the mat.

A shoe was found at the scene, but it is not known whether it belonged to Kendrick.

'At some point, Kendrick Johnson either reached into the center of one of the rolled mats or fell into the center opening of the mat and became lodged,' sheriff's officials said in a statement.

'We feel like he was trying to reach a shoe that was down that hole,' the sheriff told the Valdosta Daily Times, adding that no one knows for sure why he reached into the mat 'but him and the good Lord.'

The student was upside down in the mat, with blood rushing to his head and upper extremities, causing him to pass out, the sheriff said.

Keeping a human body upside down for an extended period of time can be deadly, causing hemorrhaging, stroke and heart failure.

Although investigators do not believe foul play was involved, the sheriff said he and his investigators will continue interviewing students and friends who have additional information.
