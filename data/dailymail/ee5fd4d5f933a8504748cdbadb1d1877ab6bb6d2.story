A sunken vessel in the Java Sea has been confirmed as the wreck of the USS Houston, a cruiser sunk by the Japanese during a ferocious Second World War battle.

It serves as the final resting place for about 700 sailors and Marines.

The wreck has long been a popular recreational diving site, but has been confirmed by US and Indonesian Navy divers as being the remains of the Houston, nicknamed The Galloping Ghost Of The Java Coast.

USS Houston was launched in 1929 and in the Second World War was one of the U.S Navy's most powerful ships.

Classed as a heavy cruiser, she was deployed to the Java Sea in 1942 to engage a formidable Japanese force, along with ships from the British, Australian and Dutch navies.

In the Battle of Java Sea in 1942 Houston and 14 allied ships took the fight to 17 Japanese war ships. At the time it was the biggest sea battle since the Battle of Jutland in the First World War.

Five allied ships were lost and the Houston retreated to Banten Bay. Its only means of escape was through the Sunda Strait - and that was blocked by several Japanese destroyers.

She was hit by several torpedoes, with Japanese ships also raking the decks with machine gun fire.

The original crew comprised 1,061 men and of those 368 survived. 

U.S. Pacific Fleet commander Admiral Harry Harris said on Monday that divers have documented evidence the watery gravesite has been disturbed.

Assessments conducted in June to determine the condition of the Houston found that hull rivets, a metal plate and unexploded ordnance were removed from the ship. There is also oil actively seeping from the hull.

Officials are working on measures to keep the site from further disturbance.

'In my discussions with our Indonesian navy partners, they share our sense of obligation to protect this and other gravesites,' Harris said in a statement. 'Surveying the site, of course was only the first step in partnering to respect those sailors who made the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the freedoms and security that we richly enjoy today.'

The Navy History and Heritage Command concluded that all of the recorded data is consistent with the identification of the former USS Houston.

Resting off the west coast of Java, Indonesia, the ship remains sovereign property of the United States.

The Navy estimates there are more than 17,000 sunken ships and aircraft resting on the ocean floor worldwide.
