A mother who refused to pay a fine for taking her son out of school in term time to attend her Caribbean wedding was yesterday ordered to pay £280 by a court.

Frances Harden, 31, fell foul of anti truancy laws after teenager Harrison Thorpe was taken out of classes for 11 days so he could walk his mother down the aisle.

She had arranged to marry Nick Harden, 34, in an £8,000 ceremony at a four star hotel in St Lucia in 2011 in the belief the event would be taking place during this year's Easter holidays.

But the dates for the 2012 Easter holidays were two weeks earlier than the year before - and when Mrs Harden realised her mistake, Dr Rose Hegan, headmistress at Marple Hall School in Stockport, Greater Manchester, refused to grant permission to take Harrison out of school.

Mrs Harden took him anyway and yesterday pleased guilty under Section 444 of the 1996 Education Act after refusing to pay the £50 fixed penalty.

Fining her £100 plus £165 
prosecution costs and a £15 victim surcharge, chair of the bench, 
magistrate Alf Storey said: 'Whilst we note that Harrison's general 
attendance was good, the time off was taken during school term and 
started after a two week holiday period.

'You had ample time to arrange your wedding and holiday to lie within those designated holiday periods.'

A frustrated Mrs Harden accused schools of 
'inconsistency' when agreeing to giving pupils time off during term 
time as her youngest son Alex, six, was allowed out of classes by his primary school.

She had even filed a Freedom of Information request 
asking Stockport Council to reveal the number of pupils being allowed 
time off during term time since 2010.

And after yesterday's hearing, Mrs Harden admitted she intended to continue her fight.

Mrs Harden, a care assistant, said: 'I feel so relieved it's over but the issue still remains.

'I do think the whole decision 
surrounding holidays and time off from school should be made by an 
independent person, as opposed to the Headteacher because there are so 
many grey areas.

'There's a pupil off school at the 
moment because he's in Turkey - yet the headmistress didn't think our 
wedding was a special enough circumstance.

'I think the whole process needs to 
be looked at, so I'm going to write a letter to the relevant body. It's
ridiculous because what one person deems a special circumstance may 
not be to another. It needs to be consistent throughout school and 
boroughs.

'Harrison's education was not 
affected by the time off - he's actually gone up two sets in English and
computing since. He's a great pupil and loves school.

'I can understand procedures being in
place for kids playing truant and families who find it difficult to 
engage their kids into education, but this wasn't the case in this 
circumstance - and that is proved by Harrison's attendance records and 
grades.'

Mrs Harden nee White and her long 
time partner Nick, a 34-year old project manager booked the 
Caribbean wedding after being together for 12 years. Harrison is her son
from a previous relationship.

She told the JPs: 'This was not just a
holiday - this was our wedding that we had planned. The school was 
initially contacted by email in 2011 after we booked our wedding but no 
response was given.

'A few more emails followed - no 
response. I emailed again and it took three phone calls before I finally
spoke to the head mistress - on the 5 or 6 of March she eventually 
called me. I asked if this could be requested off.

'I explained that this was our wedding and it was a special circumstance but she stated that it was not going to be authorised.'

Mrs Harden also brought with her to court school reports and attendance records which showed Harrison was a good student.

She added: 'He had no time off school
- we haven't requested any time off school since he started. I just 
wish that if the Head off schools are given the power to make these 
decisions they need to be consistent and equal.

'This has not had a detrimental effect on Harrison's education - he's hit his targets and succeeded his targets since then.

'Down to the inconsistency being made
I didn't think I should have been fined for this occasion - we 
requested it and we had given all the information.

'April is a special time for our 
family. My husband's grandfather got married on the same day and it's my
birthday and my son's birthday in April, so we wanted to integrate it. 
It was a special time for the family.'

But Mr Hamza Soren, prosecuting for 
Stockport Council said: 'This case arose from an unauthorised term-time 
holiday. The defendant did make a request on March 6, 20012 and that is 
the only official record of request but it was refused.

'The school does not see the wedding or holiday as a special circumstances and Mrs White was subsequently fined £50, then £100.

'Prosecution is the last resort but 
in cases like this where there is unauthorised time off, it is necessary
in order to prevent harm to a child's education.

'There are thirteen weeks' holidays 
throughout the school year where parents could allow their children to 
attend a special occasion. There are exceptional reasons down to ill 
health grounds, or when children have to visit an elderly or poor 
relative.'
