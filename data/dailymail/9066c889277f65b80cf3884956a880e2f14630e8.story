The country's financial systems could be at high risk of a cyber attack with the personal data of millions susceptible to threat, MPs fear.

Politicians have held a string of meetings in recent months amid concern the UK's markets are not being well enough protected against hackers who have the power to disable entire systems virtually. 

The House of Commons Treasury Select Committee is reportedly looking further into fears which rise after one of the biggest security breaches in banking history at JP Morgan.

The UK financial sector could be susceptible to cyber attacks, it has been claimed, following recent investigations

The information of seven million businesses and more than 70million households was compromised by the cyber attack in the summer. 

Andrew Tyrie,the chairman of cross-party Treasury Select Committee, said banks were constantly at risk. 

'The Treasury Committee has been looking at this issue for a number of years,' he told the Sunday Telegraph. 

'The JP Morgan case illustrates the scale of the risks and importance of ensuring that firms, regulators, and, where appropriate, intelligence agencies are taking all reasonable steps to prevent cyber crime.' 

JP Morgan revealed it had been victim to a cyber attack in the summer in which the details of millions of businesses and households were compromised 

In June a group of hackers accessed the details of tens of millions of JP Morgan customers. The bank wasn't aware of the attack until mid-August, closing all access paths to online banking over 90 different servers. 

In February the Bank of England warned the British financial sector needed to be better prepared for hackers after a simulated attack.
