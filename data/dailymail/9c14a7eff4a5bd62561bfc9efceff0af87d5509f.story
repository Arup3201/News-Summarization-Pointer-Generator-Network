Nine suspected Al Qaeda members have gone on trial in Yemen accused of plotting to assassinate the country's president.

Yemen is battling one of the terror groups most active franchises, known as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.

It has already been foiled in several attempted attacks on Western targets, including airliners.

Caged: Yemeni Al Qaeda suspects attend their first hearing at the state security court in the country's capital Sanaa yesterday, where they are accused of plotting to kill the country's president, Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi

It is claimed that six members of the 
group planted an explosive device on a road used by President Abd-Rabbu 
Mansour Hadi on his way to his office at the presidential palace.

The defendants also face charges of plotting to kill officers in the country's security forces and kidnap foreigners.

The main suspect in the attack is still at large.

The court heard that the intention was to detonate the bomb remotely and kill the president. But the device was discovered and dismantled by security forces.

It was one of several attempted attacks on the life of President Hadi, who was elected in February 2012.

Plot: It is claimed that six members of the group planted an explosive device on a road used by President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi on his way to his office and that the group planned to kidnap foreigners

His predecessor Ali Abdullah Saleh stepped down as part of a U.S.-backed power transfer deal that ended months of popular protests against his three decades in office.

The hearing which began yesterday follows a trial that concluded in September in which three members of the militant network were convicted of similar charges.

The court of first instance in Sanaa in September found three suspected al Qaeda members guilty of plotting to kill Hadi and sentenced them to one, five and seven years in jail.
