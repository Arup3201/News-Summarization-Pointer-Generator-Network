A Florida adult entertainment club shaped like breasts is getting a major reduction next month.

The city of Winter Park bought the jiggle joint currently called Christie’s Cabaret but nicknamed the 'Booby Trap' for $990,000 this week and they plan on demolishing the structure.

Winter Park Planning Manager Jeff Briggs told the Orlando Sentinel that the City Council wanted the 'heinous' structure removed as soon as possible.

Bye bye boobies: The city of Winter Park bought the club nicknamed the 'Booby Trap' for just under $1 million and they plan to tear it down next month 

Briggs said that buyers have expressed interest in buying the land from Winter Park once the joint is gone and said the city will do what it needs to sell.

The club, once known as Club Harem and Club Rio, was annexed by Winter Park a decade ago.

Adult entertainment establishments would normally be prohibited on the zoned land, but the gentleman’s club was grandfathered in when the property was annexed into the city in 2004.

A man named John Prevatt and his two sisters inherited the land about 50 years ago and leased it to a man who built the 'Booby Trap'.

Other land operators tried to make the structure less titillating by painting it white and adding a dome in between the two other structures.

Back in December the City Commission voted unanimously to buy the business and then demolish it, despite some who said the city should pursue legal action over land zoning.

'The owner of the property has offered to sell us that property. They were asking for $1 million for it, and we got them down to $990,000,' said City Manager Randy Knight in December meeting.

First Amendment rights: The city thought about suing the club over zoning issues but feared that the argument would become about freedom of speech, which the city cannot overturn 

Knight said that they didn't want a lawsuit with the club because it would become about the First Amendment rather than about zoning since the business has been operating for years.

'I think we need to be very judicious about why we’re doing this,' Mayor Kenneth Bradley said.

'While some people would think this business in heinous, we also have to support the rights of free speech for other people to do this.'

City Commissioner Carolyn Cooper agreed that they should buy the building rather than pursue legal action.

The city bought the property for $160,000 more than it was appraised angering a few residents.
