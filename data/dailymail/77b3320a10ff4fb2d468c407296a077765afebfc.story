Anyone passing a popular South East London venue this week may have thought they'd stepped back in time to the hedonistic 90s, when dance music ruled the decks and raving was mandatory on a Saturday night for Britain's hardcore clubbers.

Thumping tunes rang out from The Vaults under Waterloo station while inside people bounced around wearing neon clothing and waving glow-sticks.

However there wasn't a hint of an illegal drug in the air - as the only high these ravers craved was the rush of endorphins from exercising.

Fun workout: Participants take part in the 'fitness rave' in London this week

High on endorphins: The fitness fans wore neon clothing and waved glow-sticks

They were taking part in a 'Fitness Rave' a new pop up class that's started in London and will soon be available at other venues across the country.

The high energy class lasts
 an hour with participants following the moves of three teachers on stage.

A 
combination of cardio, interval training and conditioning workouts - set to old school dance classics - means they burn up to 500 calories while they feel like they're having a ball.

One of the happy 'ravers', Raina Marwaha, 31, told the MailOnline: 'The event was simply, brilliant and its definitely something we all want to do again, the atmosphere was fantastic.'

Another, Georgina Spenceley, 26, from Harlow, Essex, said: 'It was the perfect combination of a fun workout, neon outfits and my favourite 90s dance hits. With glow sticks highlighting our every move, it was a non-stop underground fitness party.'

The fitness rave is the brainchild of fitness instructor Shara Tochia, 28,  
from Clerkenwell, London, who is determined to bring it to the masses.

Work it! The class can burn up to 500 calories with cardio and interval training sections

Dancing to fitness: Many of those taking part were having too much fun to feel the burn

And stretch... like the popular Zumba classes, the fitness rave involves working out to music

She is already taking London’s fitness industry by storm via her website Fitness-Freak.com, an online 
booking service where users can access more than
 6,000 exercise classes around the capital every week.

Shara said: 'It's not just for the hardcore fitness crowd – we also aim to 
cater for those who are new to fitness, who maybe don't know where to 
start. The classes can be enjoyed by everyone at all levels. Most 
importantly it is about making friends, enjoying a new hobby and 
improving your confidence.'

Shara added that following the success in London, she hopes to roll it out in more British 
cities before the end of the year - meaning more mass fitness raves will be held for anyone keen to get raving for a health kick.

In it together: The mass class is run by following the teachers at the front

Happy feet: There are plans for more pop up fitness raves

She said: 'We’re looking at Manchester, Edinburgh 
and others before 2013 is finished. We have high hopes that it is the 
future for fitness in Britain. We’re constantly looking at new ideas and
 innovations, such as the pop-up raves.

'A beach party during the summer 
with the glorious sunshine we're having could be the next event. If it 
gets people burning calories and having fun, we’ll consider it.'

But for those who can't wait for another pop up event to 'get their rave on' Gymbox are now launching 'rave' classes which will also include trampolines to truly get exercisers jumping.
