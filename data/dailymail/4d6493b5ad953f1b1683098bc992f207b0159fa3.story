Manchester United sent scouts to watch Brazilian attacking midfielder Roberto Firmino at Hoffenheim this weekend.

The 23-year-old, who has been in fine form in the Bundesliga, is in high demand, with United the latest in a string of Premier League clubs to show an interest. 

Everton, Liverpool and Arsenal have all considered bids for the 23-year-old Brazilian who has a release clause reputedly set at £14.5million.

A skillful dribbler - in the past two seasons only Lionel Messi and Eden Hazard have embarked on more succesful dribbles in Europe's top leagues - and with all the tricks and flicks you might expect from a Brazilian international forward, Firmino is an attacking midfielder with an eye for goal.

He is not an out and out goalscorer, as his record of 6 goals in 25 Bundesliga games this season shows, but Firmino is a capable finisher when the chance arises.

Last season's tally of 16 goals for Hoffenheim earned him his first Brazil call-up early this term, and he announced himself in the international stage with a stunning 25 yard strike into the top corner to earn the selecao a win against Austria in just his second game.

However, it is not for his goalscoring exploits that Louis van Gaal will want the 23-year-old, but his playmaking.

Firmino loves to pick a pass, sliding through balls into the strikers from his position in behind, and has racked up 18 league assists since the start of last season.

To put that number in context, that's as many as Manchester United's entire midfield against Tottenham - Juan Mata, Ander Herrera, Marouane Fellaini, Daley Blind and Michael Carrick - have managed in the Premier League over the past two seasons.

The Brazilian is usually deployed behind the central striker, but can operate out wide on the left, where his pace and quick feet allow him to beat a man before picking out team-mates.

As well as running past defenders with the ball he has a knack for making attacking runs from deep without it, posing a threat in behind whether coming from central areas on the wing. 

And, when stationed wide on the left, Firmino has the ability to cut inside and unleash a strike at goal with his favoured right foot, or trouble the full back down the outside with his trickery, causing defenders plenty of problems. 

It remains to be seen if he is quick enough to be a dynamic No 10 in the Premier League, but the performances in Germany have earned praise from the likes of Bayern Munich sporting director Mathias Sammer.

Firmino's dribbling, goals and assists have made him one of the hottest properties in the Bundesliga

'Firmino is a great player,' said Sammer this week, although he ruled out the player moving to Bayern. 

But the player, his agent, and Hoffenheim have all admitted he could well leave this season, alerting Premier League clubs to the possibility of nabbing a star who is undoubtedly one of the Bundesliga's hottest prospects.
