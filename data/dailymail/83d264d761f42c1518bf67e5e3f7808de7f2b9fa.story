San Diego Padres' Alex Torres has became the first baseball player to wear a new cap designed to protect pitchers from line drives to the head.

Major League Baseball approved the bulky hat in January, nearly a year-and-a-half after pitcher Brandon McCarthy suffered life-threatening brain injuries when he was struck. He has recovered.

Torres said he copped some flak from team mates when he debuted the oversized cap while pitchingÂ against the Dodgers on Saturday, but insisted it was worth it.

'It could save our lives, if someone hits a ball to your head,' the 26-year-old Venezuelan told MLB.com. 'I get it for free, so I'm just gonna use it to see how it feels.'

The pitcher ordered the cap about a month ago and wore it while playing catch over the past week.

'The difference between how this hat and the regular hat feels isn't much,' Torres said.

'I tried it before using it in the game, playing catch. It doesn't feel really bad. It doesn't feel like how it looks on my head.'

The heavier and bigger hat, introduced this year following a spate of terrifying and bloody head injuries in the last few years, was tested by volunteers.

Major leaguers and minor leaguers won't 
be required to wear it - comfort is likely to be a primary concern.

'Obviously, it'd be a change,' two-time Cy Young winner Clayton Kershaw of the Los Angeles Dodgers told the MLB Network.

'I'm definitely not opposed to it. I think it'd take a lot of getting used to. You don't look very cool, I'll be honest.'

Designer: The safety plates made by isoBLOX are sewn into baseball cap and custom fitted

The safety plates made by isoBLOX are sewn into the hat and custom fitted, protecting the temples and forehead.

They weigh an extra six to seven ounces - a baseball weighs about five ounces - and offer protection to the forehead, temples and sides of the head. They'll make the hats about a half-inch thicker in the front and around an inch wider on the sides.

Several pitchers have been hit in the head by line drives in recent seasons.

Brandon McCarthy sustained a brain contusion and skull fracture after being struck in 2012 and Doug Fister was hit during the World Series that October.

Toronto's J.A. Happ and Tampa Bay's Alex Cobb were sidelined after being hit last year.

McCarthy tweeted that he had already tried out the fortified cap and that it was 'headed in right direction but not game ready.'

Arizona reliever Brad Ziegler said: 'I think they're on the right track, but the hat they approved isn't remotely close to comfortable enough to wear in games.'

In an email to The Associated Press, he said, 'If you're not 100 percent focused on executing your pitches, you have almost no chance of success. And that hat is uncomfortable enough that it would be a big distraction to wear it.'

'We talked to a lot of guys who had been through this, and they provided a wealth of information to help us,' said Bruce Foster, CEO of the 4Licensing Corporation, parent company of isoBLOX.

'We went through a myriad of different designs to develop this.'

Foster said the cap went through extensive testing and provided protection from line drives up to 90 mph in the front of the head and 85 mph on the side.

Line drives in the majors have been clocked at even faster rates.

In December 2012, MLB medical director Dr. Gary Green presented ideas on protective headgear to executives, doctors and trainers.

The prototypes under study included some made of Kevlar, the high-impact material often worn by military and law enforcement and NFL players.

Several companies tried without success to make a product that would be approved by MLB and the players' union, with isoBLOX the first to get the OK.
