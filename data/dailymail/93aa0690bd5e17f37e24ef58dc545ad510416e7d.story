Colours have the ability to stir emotions - from red for anger, and blue for sadness - yet one artist has taken this a step further by converting these colours into music.

Neil Harbisson was born with achromatopsia, the most extreme form of colour-blindness, which leaves him only able to see in black and white.

He created an electronic ‘eye’ that lets him ‘hear’ colours as different musical frequencies - and has now used this system to conduct the world’s first 'colour choir'.

An 'electric eye' worn on the forehead of Spanish artist Neil Harbisson, pictured in white, turns colours to musical frequencies. He used these tones to compose a piece of music which was recently performed by the world's first colour-conducted choir, pictured, in Barcelona

Harbisson developed the so-called ‘antenna’ to interpret the world around him. 

It receives light waves and converts them into different sound frequencies, and high or low-pitched tones.

Harbisson can then hear these tones, through the antenna, using bone conduction.

As part of Vodafone’s Firsts campaign, Harbisson used this system to teach an orchestra in Spain to recognise which colours go with which frequencies.

They then performed a piece of music based on his teaching.

The composition was created using colours taken from an image of the Palau de la Musica in Barcelona.

It was performed by 42 members of the Palau’s Youth Choir and the Catalan Quartic String Quartet. 

To create the music, Harbisson recorded the spectrum of colours taken from an image of the Palau de la Musica using an antenna fixed to his forehead, pictured. These tones were ordered to create a musical score

Harbisson, pictured front, taught musicians and singers which colours matched with which frequencies, using cards held in front of his 'electric eye'. The sounds were played on a loud speaker

To create the music, Harbisson recorded 
the colours taken from an image of the Palau de la Musica using an antenna fixed to his forehead.

These tones were ordered to create a musical score. 

Harbisson taught the musicians which 
colours matched with which frequencies, using his Eyeborg app.

When the phone's camera is held over a 
colour, the app plays the relevant frequency by capturing pixels 
from the centre of an image.

Each member played, or sung, notes based
 only on the colours they saw on the tablet devices in front of them and
 the tablets were controlled by Harbisson.

Each member played, or sung, notes based only on the colours they saw on tablet screens in front of them, and the tablets were controlled by Harbisson.

To create the music, Harbisson held a photo of the glass ceiling from the Palau de la Musica in front of his antenna.

He recorded the sounds and built a score using these tones.

Harbisson taught the musicians which 
colours matched with which frequencies, using colour cards and his own Eyeborg app.

When the phone's camera is held over a 
colour, the app plays the relevant frequency by capturing pixels 
from the centre of an image.

‘To see other people performing colours for the first time was a thrilling feeling for me,’ explained Harbisson.

‘For so long now I’ve been living in my own world, the only one hearing.'

He also used his Eyeborg app, pictured, to give the musicians an insight into how he sees the world. When the phone's camera is held over a colour, the app plays the relevant frequency by capturing pixels from the centre of an image. The app is free to download from the Google Play store
