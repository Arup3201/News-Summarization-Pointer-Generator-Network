Hundreds of people gathered to say goodbye to a toddler who died of cancer - at the same church where he was best man at his parents' wedding three months ago.

Charlie Harris-Beard, two, drove down the aisle to deliver his parents' wedding rings in his favourite remote-controlled car in November last year. 

Mother Fiona Harris, 30, and father Joe Beard, 30, brought forward their wedding when they learned he had just weeks to live.

Charlie acted as his father's best man at his parents' wedding in November, which was brought forward after doctors said he only had weeks to live

Despite the odds, Charlie defied doctors by living to see his last Christmas.

But despite undergoing an experimental drugs trial to try to overcome acute myeloid leukaemia, medics were unable to save him.

He died with his parents and sister Ellie, 12, by his side last Friday at Birmingham Children’s Hospital. 

Today 500 mourners packed out St Mary & All Saints Church in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, for the youngster’s funeral. 

His tiny white coffin was carried into church by his parents and escorted out by his favourite toy car 45 minutes later.

Before the service, Mr Beard posted a moving tribute to his son on the Facebook page set up by the family to publicise Charlie's plight.

He wrote: 'Well it's nearly time my little hero, what a journey we have had, loads of tears loads of pain but most importantly loads and loads of smiles and laughter.

'You brought us all closer together, you was a fighter right until the end, you proved them wrong so many times Charlie and I'm so proud of you for that.

Mourners followed the service on screens outside the Kidderminster church this afternoon

'Daddy will love you forever my little bear xxxx now go and play with all the other angels and make them smile and laugh just like you did to us.

'See you soon.... OUR LITTLE SOLDIER xxxx'

The congregation sang hymns as well as songs Sunshine, Charlie’s Song and Hero.

Canon Owain Bell, who led the service, said: 'He was such a brave little man. 

'I was amazed at his enthusiasm and energy. 

'He was blessed with his parents and family, who did everything they could for him. 

'He was an inspiration to so many people. We just want to give thanks for his life and courage.'

Among those who attended the service were 120 postal workers who worked alongside Mr Beard. 

A group of them previously recorded an album to raise money for Cords4Life, a charity set up by Charlie’s parents.

Postman Carl Wilkes said the youngster had 'united a workforce' through the Rubber Band Aid project.

Mourners, including people wearing 'Charlie's Pride' T-shirts, gathered outside the St Mary and All Saints church in Kidderminster to pay their respects

Before the service, a cavalcade of motorbikes and scooters, with riders wearing tribute T-shirts, arrived at the church followed by a fire engine from the Hereford and Worcester fire brigade

Only three months earlier Charlie had joined big sister Ellie, 12, in the same church for their parents' wedding

He said: 'Charlie will never be forgotten and we will continue to raise funds for Cords4Life in his memory.

'We had a minute’s applause for him at work and there were a lot of tears. We consider his dad one of our own and our thoughts are with him and Fiona.'

After the service, Charlie’s coffin was taken for a private burial nearby. 

To date, Charlie’s fight against leukaemia has reached more than two million people through a social media campaign started by his mother.

During his illness, Charlie received stem cell treatment from an umbilical cord donated by a mother in the United States.

The family want to raise awareness of umbilical cord donation in the UK through their charity Cords4Life.
