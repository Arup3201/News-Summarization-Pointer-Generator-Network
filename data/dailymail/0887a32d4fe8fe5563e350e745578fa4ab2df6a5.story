A woman from New Mexico who died in a Thanksgiving Day boating accident 
off the Hillsboro Inlet in Pompano Beach drowned, according to the 
county’s Medical Examiner’s Office.

Nina Poppelsdorf, 54, was in Florida for a holiday dive trip with her nephew, according to the Broward Sheriff’s Office.

Poppelsdorf, who was a manager at one of the nation’s leading 
research laboratories was part of a group of about two dozen coming back
from a dive outing Thursday when a large wave flipped over the 45-foot 
catamaran The Coral Princess.

Witnesses said the boat was approaching 
the inlet when a wave 8 to 10 feet high came in and flipped the 
twin-hulled craft upside down.

Thanksgiving tragedy: Waves break behind a dive boat that capsized off Hillsboro Inlet near Pompano, Beach, Florida, killing a 54-year-old female passenger

Terrifying: The victim, Nina Poppensdorf, was among 23 people aboard the Coral Princess who were launched into the water when the vessel was overturned during a driving trip

Poppelsdorf was in Florida with her nephew, who is from Pennsylvania, just for the dive trip.

'They just went on this fun trip together to just do dives,' said 
sheriff’s office spokeswoman Dani Moscehlla. 'So this is especially 
tragic that it was on Thanksgiving and it ended in tragedy.'

Poppelsdorf was a senior manager of the radiation protection, 
industrial hygiene and safety center at Sandia National Laboratories, 
lab spokeswoman Heather Clark said. She was hired in Aug. 1992 at the 
lab, a federal research and development center.

'Nina worked for about 20 years at Sandia National Laboratories and made
many contributions to industrial hygiene, safety and radiation 
protection,' said Sandia Environment, Safety & Health director Sid 
Gutierrez, her supervisor.

Rescue: Fire department spokeswoman Sandra King said the boat was found 'in pieces and upside down' in the water

'She served as both a staff member and later 
as an outstanding manager. She was recently promoted to senior manager 
and was well-respected by her peers and staff alike. Her contributions 
to improving safety at Sandia are numerous and she will be missed as 
both a member of the Sandia family and as a wonderful person.'

Darrell Fong, a Sandia Labs safety engineering manager who worked 
with Poppelsdorf, said she was admired for her professionalism and 
easily identified by her laugh.

“She had a great laugh. Everyone could recognize her laughter. They’d say ‘Oh, there’s Nina.’” Fong said.

Poppelsdorf was a leader of a Sandia team that helped in the response
to the crisis at Japan’s Fukushima nuclear plant after the March 2011 
earthquake and tsunami left several reactors there without cooling 
water, Fong said. He also said Poppelsdorf was a certified diving 
instructor.

Rescue crews found the 45-foot-long catamaran ‘in pieces, upside down in the water,’ The Orlando Sun Sentinel reported.

Three other passengers were taken to a hospital with non-life threatening injuries and later released, ABC News affiliate WPLG-TV reported.

Lifeguards used wave runners to start rescuing passengers trapped on top of the flipped over dive boat, identified as the Coral Princess and registered to South Florida Diving Headquarters.

The tragic incident began unfolding shortly before 1pm when first responders received a report about a capsized catamaran.

Lifeguards used water bikes to reach the vessel floating belly up and began scooping survivors out of the water.

'Chaos. Just people in the water. Just unbelievable,' one eyewitness said to ABC News.

Private boat owner Greg Oars, who also took part in the rescue mission, said he witnessed lifeguards pulling Ms Poppelsdorf out of the water, and he knew at once that something was wrong because 'she came up limp.'

Emergency personnel on the scene 
attempted to revive the 54-year-old, who was in town visiting with a 
nephew, but without success. She was taken to Broward Health North, 
where she has died.

The Broward County Medical Examiner will determine the cause of her death.

Recovery: The capsized vessel is towed back into port following the tragedy

Surviving passengers began gathering on the beach to make sure everyone was accounted for.

'We kept hearing back and forth, just trying to get a head count on 
everybody, and they were missing one,' eyewitness Greg Oars said.

Three 
other people who were injured in the incident were also hospitalized, 
but have since been treated for cuts and bruises and released.

Surviving
passengers told officials that they had been enjoying their diving 
trip, which began at 9am that morning, and were about to return to shore
when a big wave suddenly overwhelmed their craft.

Wind speeds in the area registered at 25 mph, gusting to 30 mph, and the water was choppy throughout the day, The Palm Beach Post reported.   

Eyewitness
Skip Morris, 58, said the wave's impact sent the passengers flying into
the water, adding that he believed the tragedy could have been avoided 
if only the captain had waited for the breaking waves to settle before 
trying to approach the dock.

The
U.S. Coast Guard, however, has avoided ascribing blame to anyone for 
now, only saying that the incident is under investigation.

Speaking to the Sentinel, Nancy Verreaullt, whose husband and three children were on the vessel when it capsized described the incident as 'scary.'

Her father Laurent Verreaullt, 71, told the newspaper that he had said goodbye to his son-in-law and three grandchildren early in the morning.

'It was supposed to be a four-hour diving trip and now people are hurt on Thanksgiving,' he said. I don't think the captain ever wanted that.'

Conditions on the water were dicey, the seas running 5 to 7 feet with a 
wind from the north at 20 to 28 mph, said Lisa Morgan, a Sea Tow 
International dispatcher to the Orlando Sentinel.

Survivors: Victims rescued by lifeguards from the flipped dive boat wait wrapped in towels and yellow tarps at the Hillsboro Inlet Marina

First aid: Besides Ms Poppensdorf, three other people were taken to a hospital to be treated for cuts and bruises

'During the rescue, it got pretty dicey and scary because we were told there were more people. There may be people missing,' said Pompano Beach Fire Rescue spokesman Sandra King.

Investigators worked through the night to question the survivors about 
what happened in the moments before the wave hit the catamaran.

'The wave caught it from behind and it flipped as [the captain] was 
coming in the harbor,' an unidentified passenger told ABC News.

'He was 
trying to time it. He didn't time it right and then it just flipped.'

The catamaran did not appear to be over capacity and investigators are not looking at professional misconduct by the dive company.

'Right now, it looks like this is a tragic accident,' Broward Sheriff's 
Office spokeswoman Dani Moschella said.

'What started out as a gorgeous 
day on the water for 23 people ended in tragedy.'

Sheriff's deputies identified the captain of the dive boat – owned by 
South Florida Diving Headquarters of Pompano Beach – as Dennis 
Winchester, 53. He refused to comment as he left the substation just 
before 7 p.m last night.
