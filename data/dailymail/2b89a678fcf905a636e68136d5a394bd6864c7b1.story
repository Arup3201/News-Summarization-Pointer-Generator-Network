Californian daredevil Ron Patrick has installed a 1,500 jet engine into the back of his new-shape VW Beetle, providing it with extreme acceleration. 

Patrick, 47, fitted the massive engine to the back of the small hatchback at a cost of $200,000. 

With the new infusion of power, the car is well able to exceed the the 140mph maximum speed measured by the car's on-board speedometer.

Patrick regularly enjoys taking his car for a spin at night where it is regularly pulled over by curious police officers 

The amazing car has 1,500bhp - 500 more than a Bugatti Veyron and 1,400 horsepower more than a Beetle

Under full power, the car shoots out a 50ft trail of flame when the afterburners are engaged.  

The car, which is road legal is a firm favourite at motoring shows in California although he does take it on late-night cruises around Silicon Valley. 

However, he is regularly pulled over by traffic police who want additional information about the unusual vehicle. 

He is now planning several other jet-powered vehicles. 

He said: 'It isn't as difficult as you would think to fit a jet engine to a car.

'I'm a mechanical engineer by profession and I have studied quite a few books.

'I spent around $25k (£15k) on the car and $25k (£15k) on the engine but then another $150k (£94k) in parts.

Inside the front of the car, Patrick has fitted several additional dials and switches for controlling the engine 

'The car has a universal appeal to everyone, it's a little bit of hell wrapped up in metal.

'It is road legal since the only pertinent law has to do with how much things can stick out the back of the car, in California, the law says 14' and my VW Beetle is 13'.

'It isn't any more or less difficult driving with a jet engine in place, I'd say you just have to be careful when backing up.

'People love the car because I think it appeals to people's imagination, even the birds refuse to poop on it.'

Patrick was forced to weld in additional reinforcing struts in the rear of the car to cope with the crazy power

According to Thomas, the jet powered car is not his final experiment with jet power

Amazingly, the unusual car is street legal and can be driven on the road
