On trial: Isaac Aguigui is accused of murdering a former comrade who he thought betrayed an anarchist militia

A former soldier accused of killing two people and leading a plot to assassinate President Obama worked at the last Republican National Convention, it has been revealed.

Isaac Aguigui is currently on trial alongside three comrades charged with murdering another soldier and his girlfriend because they had apparently betrayed their anarchist militia group.

The Army private was pictured on the floor of the 2008 GOP convention in St Paul, Minnesota, where he apparently served as a page.

Gawker identified the alleged killer from a photograph published in Reuters in September 2008.

The picture was captioned: 'Republican National Convention page Isaac Aguigui watches from the edge of the floor at the start of the first session of the 2008 Republican National Convention in St Paul, Minnesota September 1, 2008.'

The man in the photograph is wearing a badge saying 'Isaac Aguigui', and bears a striking similarity to the defendant's mugshot.

This year's Republican convention is currently taking place in Tampa, Florida.

Aguigui and three others are accused of killing Michael Roark, 19, and his 17-year-old girlfriend Tiffany York near their base at Fort Stewart, Georgia in December last year.

Roark had apparently become involved with F.E.A.R., an anarchist militia founded by Aguigui whose name stood for Forever Enduring Always Ready.

He fell in with his alleged killers when they served together in the 4th Brigade Combat Team of the Army's 3rd Infantry Division.

Prosecutors said the group believed it had been betrayed by Roark, who left the Army two days before he was killed, and decided the ex-soldier and his girlfriend needed to be silenced.

Accused: Aguigui, right, being led away from court in Georgia last December

Attorney Isabel Pauley said Aguigui funded the militia using $500,000 in insurance and benefit payments from the death of his pregnant wife a year ago.

Aguigui was not charged in his wife's death, but Ms Pauley told the judge her death was 'highly suspicious'.

She said Aguigui used the money to buy $87,000 worth of semiautomatic assault rifles, other guns and bomb components that were recovered from the accused soldiers' homes and from a storage locker.

He also apparently used the insurance payments to buy land for his militia group in Washington state.

Victims: Michael Roark, 19, and Tiffany York, 17, were found shot in the head near Fort Stewart in December

In a videotaped interview with military investigators, Aguigui allegedly called himself 'the nicest cold-blooded murderer you will ever meet'.

The prosecutor said the militia group had big plans - plotting to take over Fort Stewart by seizing its ammunition control point, and bombing the Forsyth Park fountain in nearby Savannah.

Ultimately, prosecutors said, the militia's goal was to overthrow the government and assassinate the President.

One former member of the group has pleaded guilty to the charges, and is testifying against his former comrades.

All are charged by state authorities with malice murder, felony murder, criminal gang activity, aggravated assault and using a firearm while committing a felony.
