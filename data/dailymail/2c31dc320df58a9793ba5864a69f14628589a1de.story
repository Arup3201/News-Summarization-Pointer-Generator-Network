A truck driver's dash-cam has captured the heart-stopping moment a car travelling next to him slammed into the front of his vehicle after spinning 180 degrees onto oncoming traffic.

Driving along the Calder Freeway in Victoria, a dark blue vehicle can be seen travelling in the same direction as the truck in the lane to its right. 

The car in front of it is then seen slowly coming to a halt as traffic builds up in the lane.

However this detail is clearly missed by the blue vehicle's driver, who continues on at the same speed. 

They then attempt to break quite suddenly, with smoke seen streaming from the tires. 

However the move came far too late, forcing the driver to swerve to his left while still travelling at a high speed, in order to avoid the vehicle in front of them.

It's at this point that the driver loses complete control of his vehicle, which spins a complete 180 degrees, and begins to travel towards oncoming traffic.

It happened just after the driver failed to notice a car slowing in front of him on the highway, and swerves to avoid it at the last moment

The truck driver, known only as Paul, is heard swearing loudly as the car collides head first into his vehicle's right hand side before being thrown backwards into the road's barricade.

Within six hours of being shared online, the shocking video accumulated over 1500 likes and almost 300 comments after being viewed over 99,0000 times on Facebook.

Dash Cam Owners Australia, which shared the video on their page, assured that the driver had not sustained any serious Injuries.

It also noted that the truck's FUPS (Front Underrun Protection System) stopped the car from being dragged under the truck.
