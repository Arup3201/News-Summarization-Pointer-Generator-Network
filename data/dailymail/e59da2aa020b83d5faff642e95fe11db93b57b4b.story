It can be notoriously difficult to win over the in-laws.

But Heidi Withers may have a tougher 
task than most after her future mother-in-law emailed her a vicious 
character assassination in which she attacked her for her ‘staggering 
uncouthness and lack of grace’.

Carolyn Bourne, a renowned grower of
pinks and dianthus flowers, told Miss Withers, 29, she should attend a 
finishing school in ‘utmost haste’ to get rid of her ‘bad manners’.

She went on to describe her as ‘an ideal candidate for the Ladette to Lady television series’.

The email was intended to be a 
private rant. But shocked Miss Withers, a PA for a London recruitment 
firm, sent it on to a select group of friends. Surprised and amused, the
friends in turn forwarded the message on to their friends.

And by last night the email had been 
posted on numerous websites, with thousands writing comments about the 
‘mother-in-law from hell’.

Mrs Bourne, the stepmother of Miss 
Withers’ fiancé Freddie Bourne, sent the email after the young couple 
had spent a weekend at her £500,000 five-bedroom detached home on the 
picturesque outskirts of Dawlish, Devon.

Incensed by her future 
daughter-in-law’s behaviour, the 60-year-old wrote: ‘It is high time 
someone explained to you about good manners. Yours are obvious by their 
absence and I feel sorry for you.’

Mrs Bourne, who is married to 
Freddie’s 63-year-old father Edward, even said Miss Withers’ behaviour 
had left their pet dog Bomber ‘profoundly upset, depressed and anxious’.

Mrs Bourne, who runs Whetman Pinks, a
sprawling plant nursery based around 30 industrial greenhouses in the 
grounds of her home, went on to list several examples of Miss Withers’ 
apparent lack of manners.

She accused her of poor table 
manners, insulting the family in public and failing to send a 
hand-written card to say thank you after her stay.

And she rounded off the email with a withering attack on the nature of the couple’s relationship.

‘One could be accused of thinking 
that Heidi Withers must be patting herself on the back for having caught
a most eligible young man,’ she concluded. ‘I pity Freddie.’

Mrs Bourne also criticised Miss Withers’ parents for failing to save enough money for their daughter’s wedding.

Miss Withers’ mother Sylvia, a nurse, and father Alan live with their two Yorkshire terriers in a five-bedroom £450,000 detached cottage set in half an acre in the village of Aylton, near Ledbury in Herefordshire.

A neighbour said: ‘They are such a lovely family and Heidi is a brilliant girl. They really are the salt of the earth.

‘I don’t know why the lad’s stepmother is getting involved.’

Last night 29-year-old Freddie, who runs online bicycle shop Capital Cycles and lives in Putney, South-West London, declined to comment.

Mrs Bourne also refused to answer any questions as she attended a Horticultural Trades Association plant show at Stoneleigh Park, Coventry.

Mind your manners: Carolyn Bourne, a renowned grower of pinks and dianthus, sent Heidi Withers the vicious email after her future daughter-in-law visited Mrs Bourne's Devon home

Her husband Edward said: ‘We are aware of what is being said. I know it is very boring, very repetitive and very dull but we will not be making any comment and neither will my wife.’

Miss Withers and Mr Bourne are not the first to suffer acute embarrassment because of out-of-control email round robins.

A derogatory email exchange between Harry Fildes, 25, and Sebastian Marsh, 24, about Mr Marsh’s ex-girlfriend spread rapidly in March after Mr Fildes accidentally sent a copy to the girl in question.

Mr Marsh was later sacked by his company, Miller Insurance.

And Holly Leam-Taylor, a graduate trainee at consultants Deloitte, quit in December 2009 after sending an email discussing attractive male staff.

It is high time someone explained to you about good manners. Yours are obvious by their absence and I feel sorry for you.

Unfortunately
for Freddie, he has fallen in love with you and Freddie being Freddie, I
gather it is not easy to reason with him or yet encourage him to 
consider how he might be able to help you. It may just be possible to 
get through to you though. I do hope so.

If
you want to be accepted by the wider Bourne family I suggest you take 
some guidance from experts with utmost haste. There are plenty of 
finishing schools around.

Please,
for your own good, for Freddie’s sake and for your future involvement 
with the Bourne family, do something as soon as possible.

Here are a few examples of your lack of manners:

I
understand your parents are unable to contribute very much towards the 
cost of your wedding. (There is nothing wrong with that except that 
convention is such that one might presume they would have saved over the
years for their daughters’ marriages.)

If
this is the case, it would be most ladylike and gracious to lower your 
sights and have a modest wedding as befits both your incomes.
