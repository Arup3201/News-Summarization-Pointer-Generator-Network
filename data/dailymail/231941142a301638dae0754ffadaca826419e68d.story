An Arab princess who said she has not received 'a penny' since divorcing her husband - a member of the Qatari royal family - last year is suing him for a £100million share of his oil fortune in the British courts.

Meshkah Tawfik, 40, who married Sheikh Hamad bin Jasim Al Thani in 1991, said he had left her with so little money that she was forced to sell her £240,000 Rolls-Royce Ghost as she couldn't afford the £15,000 insurance.

The couple, who both live in London, have two children - Prince Sultan, six, and Princess Sheikha, 13.

Meshkah Tawfik, 40, who married Sheikh Hamad bin Jasim Al Thani in 1991, said he had left her with so little money that she was forced to sell her Rolls-Royce Ghost (similar to the one pictured) as she couldn't afford the £15,000 insurance

Tawfik said she cannot pay their school 
fees, adding that her four staff - a chef, nanny, bodyguard and driver -
all work for free owing to her financial predicament, according to the 
Sunday Times.

The sheikh, 62, who was educated at Sandhurst and is said to be worth £800million, had married Tawfik in an Islamic ceremony in London.

The former interior, 
petroleum and finance minister obtained a divorce in Qatar, which she did not attend, after the couple become estranged several years ago.

Tawfik's decision to settle their divorce in the UK is an example of 'forum shopping' - where the best legal jurisdiction is chosen to maximise the chance of a favourable outcome.

The mother-of-two lives in an £8million townhouse in Bayswater which, despite its price tag, is in state of disrepair, with peeling paint and a rat-infested basement.

'I am suing him not for me but to get 
maintenance for the children. As members of the royal family they should
not be living like this,' she told the paper.

In 2010, the Al-Thani family purchased Harrods - and Tawfik illustrated her once lavish lifestyle by producing a statement of her daughter's credit card bill from the store.

It showed that the 11-year-old had spent over £90,000 there in 2011.

Sheikh Hamad is said to 
own a portfolio of properties in Britain, the Middle East and US.

His uncle Khalifa, once emir of Qatar, was deposed in a bloodless coup by his son in 1995.

When Sheikh Hamad was found guilty of 
staging an abortive coup a year later, he and Tawfik left the country.

He was sentenced to death in his absence but this was revoked in 2006.

Tawfik has retained the services of family lawyer Ayesha 
Vardag.

David Hodson, the sheikh's lawyer, told the Sunday Times: '[My client] believes their 
family matters and the lives of their children are private.'

The Shard, which is owned by the Qatar royal family

Last August, Qatar's wealth fund - run by the Al Thanis - spent nearly £1billion to buy into British airport owner BAA, stepping up a shopping spree that has seen it hoover up a raft of household names.

Qatar Holdings paid £900million for 20 per cent of BAA, which runs Heathrow, Stansted, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Southampton airports.

The deal extended Qatar’s drive to invest in Britain, where the tiny Middle Eastern nation – smaller than Belgium – is estimated to have spent some £10billion of oil money already.

UK assets include Harrods and 26 per cent of supermarket giant Sainsbury’s worth around £1.6billion.

Qatar also owns Europe’s tallest skyscraper The Shard, from which members of its royal family can gaze upon the rest of their property portfolio.

This includes vast swathes of Canary Wharf and the Olympic Village.

No 1 Hyde Park, the world’s most expensive block of flats, completes a glittering array of property investments.

Qatar can also lay claim to 20 per cent of two London markets at opposite ends of the scale.

It owns a fifth of the moneyed London Stock Exchange at the heart of the Square Mile and the same stake in Camden Market, home of ageing punks and European tourists seeking bargain clothes.
