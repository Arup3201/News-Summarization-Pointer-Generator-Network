Chelsea will start their Champions League campaign in Group G following the draw of the 2014/15 competition on Thursday afternoon.

The Blues were amongst the top seeds for the draw and will face German side Schalke, Portugal's Sporting Lisbon and Slovenian side Maribor.

Chelsea will be hoping to repeat their 2011/12 successful campaign when they beat Bayern Munich on penalties.

Jose Mourinho's lost 3-1 on aggregate to Atletico Madrid in the semi-finals last season.

Which way to Europe: Chelsea have been in Group G for this season's Champions League draw

Schalke 04

Chelsea's Head-to-head: P 4 W 3 L 0 D 1

Star man: Julian Draxler

Manager: Jens Keller

Stadium: Gelsenkirchen

European pedigree: Having progressed from the group stages in both of the past two seasons, including topping Arsenal's group two years ago, Schalke will argue they deserve their place in pot 2 of the seedings. 

But having finished third in the Bundesliga last season, almost 30 points behind Bayern Munich, they are scarcely a European powerhouse.

Did you know: Schalke have not scored a single goal against Chelsea in their four meetings

Sporting Lisbon

Chelsea's Head-to-head: P 0 W 0 L 0 D 0

Star man: William Carvalho - if he stays at the club

Manager: Marco Silva

Stadium: Esatdio Jose Alvalade

European pedigree: Returning to Europe's top talbe after three seasons in the Europa League, Sporting have decent pedigree but are not going to strike fear into many Chelsea hearts. 

With Manchester United loanee Nani and 'the Scottish Messi' Ryan Gauld, it's a talented squad, but realistically fighting with Schalke for second place.

Did you know: Sporting's player of the season, William Carvalho, is a long-term target of both Arsenal and Manchester United

Maribor

Chelsea's Head-to-head: P 0 W 0 L 0 D 0

Star man: Marcos Taveres

Manager: Ante Simunda

Stadium: Ljudski vrt

European pedigree: This is their second Champions League appearance, their first coming in 1999. Then they finished bottom of their group, conceding twelve goals in six games. 

However, last season they had an extremely encouraging Europa League campaign which only ended in a narrow 4-3 aggregate defeat to evenualy winners Sevilla.

Did you know: Maribor knocked out Celtic in the Champions League qualifiers.
