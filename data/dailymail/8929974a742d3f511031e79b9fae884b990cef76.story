After England claimed a 3-1 against India at The Oval, Sportsmail's NASSER HUSSAIN runs the rule over how both sets of players rated.

Alastair Cook 7

To be here with a 3-1 win over India, after where he was on the podium after the defeat at Lord’s, shows how mentally tough he is.

Sam Robson 3

He has made batting look hard at times and the Lions tour this winter will be a big one for him. He obviously has technical issues.

Gary Ballance 9

Looks like a fluent version of Jonathan Trott. Very composed indeed. And that catch he took yesterday was a blinder.

Man of the moment: Gary Ballance showed his composure to help his side to victory against India

Ian Bell 7 

Played outstandingly at Southampton and he’s allowed the odd quiet game, as he had at The Oval. Still a slight flaw when the ball’s around off stump.

Joe Root 9 

He’s been in phenomenal form this summer and has got his tempo spot on. He looks so well-suited to No 5 — and must now stay there.

Moeen Ali 7

His off-spin has developed superbly after people were calling him a part-timer. One or two soft dismissals with the bat, but he’s here to stay.

Jos Buttler 8

Looks more thoughtful with the bat than some of us imagined he would be — he’s not just a biffer. Apart from a few bad moments at Old Trafford, he kept well.

Utility man: Jos Buttler proved that he is capable of using the bat as well as the gloves

Chris Woakes 6

Has been unlucky with the ball for much of the series, but he’s put on a yard of pace from last summer. The key will be how he fares when there’ s no swing.

Chris Jordan 6

Got better as the series progressed. Still some wayward deliveries there, but England can live with that as he mixes in some wicket-taking balls. Handy contributions with the bat.

Stuart Broad 8

Showed a lot of character, bowling through five Tests with a dodgy knee, then batting yesterday against the short ball after breaking his nose in Manchester.

James Anderson 9.5

My admiration for him grows by the day. To keep setting top-class batsmen up takes serious skill. When the ball’s swinging, there’s no one better in world cricket.

Total 79.5/110

Murali Vijay 6

His fate mirrored the Indian team: he faded as the series progressed. Was worked over beautifully by Anderson: outswing, outswing, then inswing for the lbw.

Gautam Gambhir 1

A really odd selection when he hadn’t played Test cricket for so long. His run-out  summed things up — it was as if he wanted to escape the strike.

Cheteshwar Pujara 4

He kept getting good deliveries. Looks like the most technically organised of the Indian batsmen, but that counted for little.

Nightmare: Gautam Gambhir was run out from a throw by Chris Woakes during the fifth Test 

Virat Kohli 3

England exposed his technical deficiencies superbly. Tried to fight hard yesterday but against Broad, Anderson and the moving ball, he wasn’t up to it.

Ajinkya Rahane 5

His superb hundred at Lord’s set up India’s only win, but — like Vijay — he faded. Drove a bit too early, which led to three caught and bowleds.

MS Dhoni 6

Showed that you can score runs without a great technique, but some of the decisions he made out in the middle were a little strange. His position as Test captain will be under pressure.

Stuart Binny 4

I just couldn’t work out what he was doing in the side. Dhoni obviously had no confidence in his bowling and he just looked to tee off with the bat.

Ravichandran Ashwin 6 

His bowling held up an end and at least gave Dhoni some control — when he wasn’t trying too many variations. His batting looked in good nick.

Bhuvneshwar Kumar 7

The only one of India’s bowlers to play all five Tests and it showed. He started the series superbly, but his bowling (and his batting) fell away.

Varun Aaron 7

Hostile and unlucky — there were a few dropped catches off his bowling. He was the only Indian bowler to regularly unsettle England’s batsmen.

Ishant Sharma 7

Sharma bowled well here at The Oval to follow up his excellent display at Lord’s. He’s one of the few Indian players to emerge from this series with his reputation enhanced.
