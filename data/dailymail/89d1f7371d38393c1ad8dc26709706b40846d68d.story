Adding a handful of rose petals to food could help fight off heart disease and diabetes, Chinese researchers have suggested.

A list of ten edible flowers, said to improve a range of illnesses from cancer to nervous disorders, has been compiled.

Many of the flowers covered in the study have been used in Chinese medicine for years, but now the study's authors are promoting their benefits to the West.

Garden medicine: Chinese researchers claim edible flowers have cancer-fighting properties

The researchers, whose findings were published in the Journal of Food Science, said the flowers contained phenolics, which are believed to have anti-inflammatory properties.

Paeonia suffruticosa - tree peonyLilium brownii var. viridulum - type of lilyFlos lonicerae - Japanese honeysuckleRosa chinensis - China roseLavandula pedunculata - French lavenderPrunus persica - peachHibiscus sabdariffa - a type of hibiscusFlos carthami - safflowerChrysanthemum morifolium -type of chrysanthemumFlos rosae rugosae - type of rose

'We think these may help reduce the risk of heart disease, certain cancers and also have anti-inflammatory powers,' lead author Lina Xiong told the Daily Star.

Her team at Zhejiang University found that adding petals from commonly found flowers such as roses, violets and nasturtiums to meals could prevent chronic diseases and promote health.

Rose petals could help with diabetes and heart disease; violets appeared to strengthen the walls of capilliares; and nasturtiums had properties that could help fight cancer and improve eyesight. 

Dr Joseph Mercola told the Star: 'Flowers are natural plant foods and 
like many plant foods in nature often contain valuable nutrients for 
your health.

'Theyâ€™re also a rich source of vitamins, including folic acid, riboflavin, pyroxidine, niacin, and vitamins E and C.'

The study looked at the level of antioxidants found in the plants, but the results have not been tested or measured on humans.

Researchers said increasing the amount of phenolics in a person's diet has been associated with reducing heart disease and some cancers.

But although the compounds were found in the flowers, there is no evidence that it can have a positive impact on health, NHS Choices highlighted.

'The current study has not assessed whether eating these flowers could have effects on human health, or at what levels they would need to be consumed to have any effects,' it added.

While the researchers hope their findings will lead to an increase in the use of edible flowers, more analysis is needed to fully determine the anti-tumor, anti-inflammation and anti-aging abilities of the plants.
