He has been dubbed Britain's vainest man and in his desperate pursuit to look like The Only Way is Essex Star Joey Essex has already gone under the knife. 

Celebrity wannabe Sam Barton is to see the consequences of spending thousands of champagne-fuelled nights out and £1,000 on accessories for his cat by declaring himself bankrupt.

The 22-year-old, who lives in Four Oaks in Sutton Coldfield, said he has spent £100,000 in just four years on nights out, dozens of bottles of champagne and plastic surgery.

But despite being £35,000 in the red Barton said debt 'doesn't really worry' him and he has 'no regrets' because he has enjoyed himself trying to mirror the lives of celebrities like Joey Essex.

The former barman  said: 'I've been absolutely crazy with money since I was 18 but especially in the last two years when I've just simply had the time of my life. I never thought of how much anything cost - if I wanted something, I bought it.

'I've spent around £55,000 trying to improve my looks and get the perfect image. The rest I've spent on designer clothes, jewellery, holidays, spa treatment and champagne. In total, I have spent around £100,000.' 

Barton managed to rack up some of the debts by his spending on plastic surgery - splashing out £20,000 on his teeth, £5,000 on Botox, £2,000 on waxing, £2,500 on tanning treatments and £10,400 on a nose job. 

He also confesses to loving the celebrity lifestyle, spending £2,000 a night on bottles of champagne worth £300. 

At one point Barton, son of European Cup-winning Aston Villa manager Tony Barton, owned 15 credit cards and store cards and had a large overdraft. He said he would frequently get friends to spend on his cards so they could give him the cash.

Barton spent thousands on plastic surgery to look like Joey Essex and had a nose job paid for by the NHS

He added:  'I would always ensure I had hard cash in my wallet, even if it meant taking another store card to the limit.' 

Barton first hit the headlines after revealing he had a free nose job on the NHS and said he wanted it to look like a real man. At the time he claimed he secured funding for the treatment because he cried and told doctors it was ruining his life.  

He said he has been advised that bankruptcy may be the best solution to his problems. 

'I'm in debt but have no regrets. I'm young and I am having the time of my life. Debt doesn't really worry me,' said the 22-year-old.

The 22-year-old said he is now £35,000 in debt 

'I am in a lot of debt but have been advised to wipe the debt out and just start again afresh.

'My mother won't be happy as she believes you should pay your debts back.

'But if I'm able to clear my debts by declaring myself bankrupt, then I'll do that.'

Mr Barton has managed to maintain his income by working two part-time jobs, as a barman and at a supermarket, as well as from handouts from generous family and friends.

'When I was a child my parents had lots of money, lost it all and made it again,' he said. 'That meant I experienced being spoiled and then having it taken away from me.

'I was always pretty good with money as a kid, though. I would save my pocket money and then make my brother spend his.

'But when I got to 18, I just wanted the glam life and to live like a celebrity. I saw Joey Essex on TV and thought I would love to be like him. He was having the time of his life and so my pursuit of the celebrity life started.

'As well as racking up lots of debt, I have been able to live the celebrity lifestyle thanks to the generosity of my family and friends who have supported me financially.'

The aspiring presenter, who dreams of appearing on Celebrity Big Brother, will present Office Girls, a reality TV show which will search for a new supergroup. Filming starts on Friday.

'It is my ultimate dream to look, feel and act like a celebrity,' he said.

'I'm chasing a lifestyle and I feel that if I mirror celebrities, like Joey, I will look good and feel good. If the celebrities are spending all their money on treatments, then so will I.'
