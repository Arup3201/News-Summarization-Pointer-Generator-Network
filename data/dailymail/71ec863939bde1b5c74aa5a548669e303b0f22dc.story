It's not quite time to say goodnight to Mr Tom. The oldest swinger in town proved this week that he can still find his way around a golf course, embarrassing along the way a few of the younger generation who might want a place in his US Ryder Cup team.

The seven shots that separated Tom Watson’s fourth-round score from that of Tiger Woods will, in likelihood, be used as a stick to beat 14-time major winner.

But that would be unfair, albeit only to the 64-year-old. His brilliant, crafty round of 68 deserves recognition in its own right, proving as it did that the five-time winner of golf’s oldest major can still do damage from way back in the fairway.

The fact he does it with such a smile on his face makes it all the more regrettable to the neutral that next year’s Open at St Andrews will be his last.

There won’t be another extension for a man who, having passed the entry cut-off of 60 years old, has received two rules exemptions to get him this far.

Those were sentimental decisions and a fair recognition of his extraordinary second-place finish in 2009, but a greater truth is that this golfer is still too good – and popular - to be pensioned off.

When the end appeared nigh, in the gloom of St Andrews in 2010 as he missed the cut in front of a small crowd, he fought back by making the cut in three of the next four years, including this one. In 2011, he was 22nd.

‘That was just a really good day,’ he said yesterday, after his four-under-par round left him on one over for the tournament. ‘Yep, I enjoyed that. Keeps the engine running.’

His gallery was one of the biggest of the day, as usual. ‘Terrible shot, Tom,’ laughed one old stager in the crowd after Watson found the green with a brilliant fairway wood at the 17th. Watson laughed back.

Moments earlier, when he balanced on the edge of a bunker at the 16th and chipped sublimely along the contours to three feet, there was one of the biggest roars of the day. He claimed his fourth birdie of the round, tipped his hat and moved on.

‘Great play, Tom,’ said a young boy in full golf gear. ‘That’s very kind, thank you,’ came the reply. He remains a gentleman of the game, impeccable in his behaviour. When a group of teenagers oddly took to mocking his hair at the 18th, he smiled and walked on.

His drive had split the fairway. ‘I think, if I’m not mistaken, that I did not miss a fairway today,’ he said afterwards, before correcting himself. ‘Sorry, I missed it on 11.’ Wood missed four.

Watson took five birdies in all, finishing his 37th Open with a four at the last after walking the 18th fairway cap in hand. He was given a standing ovation.  

It’s unique to this sport to see a man well into his seventh decade playing with the best. It’s rarer still to see one outplay them, laughing as he goes.
