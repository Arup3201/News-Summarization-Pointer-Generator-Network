Police in Idaho were able to crack the mystery of the parked car burglar in a case that the Scooby Doo gang could have solved - by following the suspect's footprints.

Police in the town of Idaho Falls said Mother Nature aided them in the arrest by blanketing the area with some Christmas Eve snow on Monday morning.

At about 5:45am, police said they began following tracks in the fresh snow that were suspiciously going from car-to-car on Holbrook Drive.

KIFI-TV reported that the footprints led the officers straight to a nearby home where they found the suspect, 20-year-old Cade Thomas Dixon.

Dixon was taken into custody and charged with burglary.

Sgt Phil Grimes of the Idaho Falls Police Department told MailOnline: 'Snow is an officer's best friend when it comes to robbery, and the worst enemy of the robber.'

Sgt Grimes said that Dixon was booked in the Bonneville County Jail, and bond was set at $15,000.

A listing on the jail's website showed that Dixon is still being housed at the jail.

Police accused Dixon of trying to enter more than 100 vehicles during his alleged Christmas Eve crime spree, but only two of them had been unlocked.

From those vehicles, cops said a small amount of cash and a GPS unit were taken from those cars.
