A young girl and her mother have been left heartbroken after their beloved pony and horse were burned alive by arsonists.

Milli Knowles, 10, and stablehand Samantha Brierley, 38, were called to the stables near Bolton where they kept their pet animals after reports of an early-morning fire.

Their nine-year-old cob, named The General, and their Shetland pony Penny, 27 - who were said to be regarded as 'family' - had been killed in the blaze. 

Destroyed: The blackened remains of stables near Bolton, Greater Manchester, where a Shetland pony and a horse were burned alive in an arson attack. Police believe the arsonists used petrol and firelighters to start the blaze

Killed: Shetland pony Penny, 27 (left) and horse The General (right), 9, who were burned alive in an arson attack on Tuesday morning. The two animals, owned by Milli Knowles and her mother Samantha Brierley, were said to be part of the family

Police believe both animals were killed when arsonists crept into their remote stables on Tuesday morning and used petrol and firelighters to set them on fire.

Milli’s father John Knowles, 44, a glass repairman, said the culprits were 'sick'.

He said: 'I have got no idea why this has happened. I can’t believe it has happened.

'How can someone do something like that? It is just sick.'

A neighbour phoned the fire brigade just after 4am on Tuesday morning when they were woken by the fire.

But the horse and pony were trapped inside the wooden building and could not be saved.

When Miss Brierley was called to the stables in Astley Bridge, Greater Manchester, she collapsed with shock.

Part of the family: Milli Knowles, 10, shown grooming her Shetland pony Penny. Milli has grown up with the animals and wants to be a stablehand when she is older. Her father Mr Knowles said Penny was part of the family and his daughter is heartbroken about what has happened

Miss Brierley said: 'I got a phone call to say the stables were on fire and I just needed to get here. Apparently I collapsed.

'Those animals were everything. I spend a big part of my life here. I feel like my heart has been ripped out.'

The fire took place just hours after Milli and Miss Brierley had taken out the animals for rides over the weekend.

Mr Knowles said: 'Milli simply cannot understand why someone would do something like this.

'She keeps asking the question: ‘Why would they do it?’ and unfortunately that question cannot be answered logically by anyone.'

Devastated: John Knowles, whose daughter Milli and fiancée Miss Brierley looked after the horses, says his family is heartbroken about what has happened. He said the arsonists, who carried out the attack on the site he is standing, were 'sick'

Burned out: The wreckage left by arsonists who burned alive two animals belonging to 10-year-old Milli Knowles and her family. Milli, her mother Miss Brierley and her father Mr Knowles had visited the stables to see the horses the night before the shocking attack

Mr Knowles said the horses had been put to bed by the family the night before.

He said: 'Then we got a phone call at 5.15 am from the stable owner telling us to come down right now.

'He had got there within minutes as he lives just up the road.

'When we got there the fire was just 
being put out by the fire brigade although it was still smoking. The 
horses had burned alive inside.'

The General: Samantha Brierley, a stablehand, loved the two animals and went to the stables every day to look after them with her daughter Milli. The pair had been out riding the horse and pony just days before the fire

Gone: The family were called to the stables early on Tuesday morning after the fire had started. Miss Brierley was so devastated by what had happened to her horses, above, that she collapsed crying on the floor

'General was my fiancee’s horse and the site was very horrific for her.

'She 
collapsed crying on the floor in front of the stables when she saw what 
had happened. The fire brigade put her in a fire engine to look after 
her for a bit.

'Milli also came down with us when we got the call. Penny was her baby and she is just as destroyed as the rest of us.'

Mr Knowles said neighbours had seen the 
stables on fire at 4.45am but another neighbour had seen the stable on 
fire around 30 minutes earlier.

He said: 'A
 van came earlier today to remove the remains of the horses although 
there is very little left of them. It is absolutely heartbreaking. The 
horses are like our kids.

Investigation: Detective Constable Dave Harris, from Greater Manchester Police, is urging members of the public to come forward with any information. The force has launched a joint investigation with the fire service after a horse and a pony were killed in a suspected arson attack

'I do not think this experience will ever leave my fiancée. I don’t see us having anymore horses in the near future.

'Samantha's job is to look after horses and this is going to make her work 
very hard. She has loved horses ever since she was a little girl.

'Penny is my daughter’s first horse and she was really attached to her. She is just destroyed and heartbroken now.

'Milli has gone through a lot of trauma with Penny because she was stolen 12 months ago although we eventually got her back.

'Now this has just topped it off really.
 She is a 10-year-old girl and she finds it very emotional. It is 
absolutely heartbreaking.'

The stables, owned by David Davies, had been rented out to the Knowles family for the past eight months. Mr Davies was due to sell the stables, along with his home and land, later this week at auction

Mr Knowles said Milli would always help muck out Penny's stable. 

He said: 'Sometimes, mainly on weekends, she would get up before 6.30am to help Samantha muck out and groom them.

'Every day after school she would go to the stables to look after Penny.

'Friends of hers and kids from school would often come around to help her groom the horses. In many ways it was a big family effort.

'Sometimes said she want to do what my fiancé does, which is to look after horses.

'She is very relaxed with animals and she really loves them. We are at a loss as to why this has happened.'

Stable owner David Davies built the stable block several years ago to house his own horses.

He has rented it out to the Knowles family for the past eight months.

Mr Davies was due to sell the stables, his nearby home and riverbank land at auction later this week.

He said: 'The scene of the fire was just horrendous. I can’t envisage how anyone could do anything like that. They owners of those animals loved them to bits.'

Detective Constable Dave Harris, from Greater Manchester Police, said police were investigating the fire along with the fire service.

He said: 'This was a deliberate fire that caused the death of two horses.

'The owner is understandably very distressed and we want to find out who did this as soon as possible.

'I would urge anyone who may have seen someone acting in a suspicious manner around the stables to contact police.'
