Tracey Emin's controversial My Bed artwork has sold for £2.2million to an anonymous buyer at Christie's in London on Tuesday night.

Before the auction, Emin said that she would like her controversial unmade bed artwork to stay in the UK - but that she doubted this would be possible as there would be no-one who could afford it.

Turner Prize shortlisted My Bed is a dishevelled monument to 'ladette' culture, surrounded by used condoms, worn knickers, cigarette butts and vodka bottles.

'Iconic': Emin said My Bed, which nearly won the Turner Prize, 'changed people's perceptions of art'

Popular: The bed, pictured on display in 2003, is currently owned by Charles Saatchi which could make £1.2m from the sale

It had been put up for auction by 
millionaire Charles Saatchi, and had been expected to net him between 
£800,000 and £1.2million.

Emin was in the packed auction room as the work was sold, to applause from the crowd.

Saatchi,
 who paid £150,000 in 2000 for My Bed, one of the key works of the Young
 British Artist movement, sold it to support the work of the Saatchi 
Gallery Foundation.

Ahead of the sale, Emin, 50, said she would prefer the work go on display rather than vanish into a private collection, but doubted anywhere could produce the necessary cash.

She told the Evening Standard: 'I feel kind of philosophical about it. The Tate really want it but they haven’t any money. No one has any money to buy it.'

Last week, she revealed how she is struck by flashbacks when she's near the bed, the display of which she said 'changed people's perceptions of art'.

She said: 'This is a surreal 
experience. Every time I'm near the bed or install the bed I get 
flashbacks and recollections of when I first saw the bed, which was in 
my bedroom and that was 16 years ago.

'When
 I made the bed today, I actually had to get in it and pull the duvet 
over me and push it back to make it feel real and look real.

'Even
 the smell and everything, it's all still there for me. It's very, very 
evocative. Except it's like waking up, I wouldn't say a nightmare, but 
definitely ... it's really strange.

'It's now going on a different journey. I just hope it goes to a nice place. It's helped me a lot.'

Emin said reactions to the artwork, which she produced after a traumatic relationship breakdown, varied across the globe.

She said: 'In Japan they were shocked by my dirty slippers but they stole some bloody knickers and some condoms'.

'In America it was like, "Yeah, we've seen feminist art before, we've done it already", no fuss, just treated it like a regular artwork.

'Of course in the UK, it just exploded with the Turner Prize. It just went crazy. I still think it's iconic. There was nothing in the world in art that has ever looked like this, that has ever been like this, it's seminal.

'It changed people's perceptions of what art is and what art can be. That's why it's still really special to me.

'If I could I would show this at my next exhibition. I still love it, I still stand by it and I made it 16 years ago.'
