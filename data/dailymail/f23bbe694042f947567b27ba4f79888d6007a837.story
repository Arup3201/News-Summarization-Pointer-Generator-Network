The man with the mouth is just days away from a blockbuster night in the ring but has again been forced to explain himself over comments surrounding homosexuality.

Boxer Anthony Mundine is shaping up for the fight of the year when he takes on undefeated Belarusian Sergey Rabchenko in Melbourne.

He took some time out to speak with Weekend Sunrise presenter Andrew O'Keefe, inviting him into his home for a intimate one on one chat before his up coming bout.

While the controversial sportsman gushed about his similarities with all time legend boxer Muhummad Ali, saying they had the 'same characteristics', he was also quizzed about some remarks he made last year, claiming homosexuality and aboriginal culture do not mix.

Following an episode of the ABC series 'Red Fern' Mundine made comments on his facebook page that the content was grossly inappropriate, which sparked some angry responses.

He criticised the show for including a homosexual character that was representing Aboriginal culture, saying god made 'ADAM & EVE' not 'Adam & Steve'.

Mr O'Keefe asked, ' do you still stand by your comments?'

Mundine replied, '100 per cent. I told you I speak the truth, I got nothing against homosexuality, if you're gay, be gay, that's you're choice, that's your right in this day and age.'

'But don't exploit it on prime time when there's kids watching and having sons come towards you and going 'dad is that all right, for a man to kiss a man?'

Re-iterating he has nothing against gay people, Mundine said it was not alright in his belief and culture because it is forbidden in aboriginal law.

Asked whether aboriginal culture could evolve like a lot of other cultures and practises have now in Australia, Mundine replied no.

'Aboriginal law, it's an old culture, there is no changing this,' he told Mr O'Keefe. 

A spokesman for Mundine told Daily Mail Australia the boxer stands on what he says.

'He has a lot of homosexual friends, he's not against gay people but in his beliefs he doesn't support homosexuality,' he said.

'The media keep pushing it and he stands on what he says.'

'He deemed the episode was grossly inappropriate for the time frame and this issue just keeps coming up, going on and on and on.'

But all his team are focused on are his up coming fight, to take on Rabchenko Wednesday night, for the WBC silver light middleweight title.

Which if he wins will launch him into a bout with Floyd Mayweather or Mexican Saul Alvarez. 

'I'm guna beat this 26 year old, 27 year old, whatever this young pup is and I'm going to prove that I am once again going to be here for another two to three years,' he told the Weekend Sunrise presenter.
