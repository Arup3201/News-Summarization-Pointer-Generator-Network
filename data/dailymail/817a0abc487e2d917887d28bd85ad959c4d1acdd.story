Ohio State Reformatory - better known as the prison in the Oscar-nominated The Shawshank Redemption - is to be transformed into a major tourist attraction.

The Reformatory built in 1886, which narrowly escaped demolition recently, has now been earmarked for a massive makeover.

Over the next six months the building will be cleaned, redecorated, and have its huge cathedral-style windows replaced as well as having heating installed in a bid to increase tourism.

The Ohio State Reformatory was built between 1886 and 1910 by architect Levi T. Scofie

Used as a 
prison for 94 years until 1990 and then as the location for many scenes in the film 
shot in 1993, the building had been designated to be destroyed to make 
way for a parking lot.

Most
 of the grounds and support buildings, including the outer wall, were 
demolished after it closed, but destroying the gigantic structure with its 25-foot high, six-foot thick walls, proved 
problematic and it remained.

The Mansfield Reformatory Preservation Society, which bought the site for a dollar in 1995, has been the focal point of the tourism drive. 

The society turned the former prison into a museum and began conducting tours to help fund its renovation.

The building attracted 80,000 visitors 
last year alone - and brought in £6m ($10m) in revenue, but tourism 
officials believe this figure can be boosted considerably with the right enhancements.

The society has already raised more than £1.2m ($2m) which was used to repair the reformatory roof, and its new plans include heating some sections of the reformatory which have not been heated for decades, and opening up additional areas to the public.

Stained glass windows which were vandalised have also been removed for repair.

A significant boost in tourism will safeguard the future of the Reformatory for generations to come say its supporters.

Last week thousands of Shawshank fans 
gathered at the reformatory in Mansfield, Ohio, to celebrate the 20th 
anniversary of the film which has now achieved cult status.

Celebrations
 included re-enactments of scenes from the film while the renovated guard 
room played host to a 1940s themed cocktail party.

The Shawshank Redemption was a slow burner to begin with. Filmed in 1993, it received encouraging reviews from critics but failed to attract large audiences.

In fact the British Video Association said the film earned a meagre £2.6m at UK cinemas and only just covered its costs from US box office sales.

But once released on home video and later on DVD the film captured the imagination of movie fans worldwide.

Earlier this year it was named by renowned film magazine Empire as the fourth best movie of all time.

Tourists and fans became increasingly keen to visit the historic building in Mansfield as a result of the film's growing success, and the building was given a new lease of life. The Shawshank Redemption bus tour includes a visit to  some of the film's most renowned locations.

Shawshank fans can visit the Bissman building where Brooks (James Whitmore) hanged himself and Red decided to 'get busy living', and see the bench where Brooks fed his birds.

Other recognisable locations include the remains of the old oak tree where Andy hid money for Red and Malabar Farm State Park where Andy followed his cheating wife.

The Mansfield Reformatory Preservation Society has worked hard on marketing the reformatory in recent years and has put on events including a huge Halloween festival,extreme ghost hunts and murder mystery dinners.

Thousands of people have come to pay homage to what many people believe is one of the greatest films of all time and the legacy of the Oscar nominated movie should ensure that visitors continue to flock to Mansfield for years to come.

However, tourists seeking the authentic 'Shawshank' experience should be careful to ensure cell doors don't close behind them.

'We don’t have keys for some of these,' one of the tour guides revealed. 'They might be in there until the next day.'
