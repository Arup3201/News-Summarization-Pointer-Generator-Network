Ella Woodward, a British health blogger who famously cured her rare but crippling nervous system disease by adopting a radical new diet two years ago, has made history in the U.K. as having the fastest selling debut cookbook since records began.

Now, the 23-year-old former model has released her $16 food bible, Deliciously Ella, in the U.S. - with a list of banned foods so long it would make self-described lifestyle guru Gwyneth Paltrow's eyes water - and already it has shot to number one on Amazon's cookbook list.

'Healthy eating doesn’t have to be crazily complicated, it can actually be so fun,' Ella tells Daily Mail Online of her approach, which consists of no meat, dairy, eggs, gluten, refined sugar, caffeine, or processed foods of any kind, and rarely any alcohol.

'My aim is to get people excited about eating more veggies, and seeing them as a delicious ingredients rather than a chore,' the brunette beauty explains.

Ella's ultra-clean diet may seem unfeasible to most, but her recipes have won her a staggering following; more than 42 million hits to her blog, Deliciously Ella, a recipe app which shot to the top of the U.S. and U.K. charts last year, and now, a record-breaking cookbook.

And while some might think that Ella's health-focused food strategy would fail to catch on in the U.S. - where more than two thirds of adults are classified as obese or overweight - Ella feels that her strong American following is down to that fact that health foods, and veganism, have become so incredibly popular, even more so here than in the U.K.

'I spent a lot of time in Los Angeles last year, and taking care of yourself is just so normal there,' she remarks. 'No one thinks you're mad for going hiking and drinking green juice for fun.'

Fan favorites include Ella's brownies, which are made from a base of sweet potatoes, and her coconut Thai curry, a creamy medley of squash and chickpeas.

Success: Ella has amassed more than 42 million views on her blog since 2012, and her new cookbook (pictured), released in the U.S. this month, has already shot to the top of Amazon's best-selling cookbook list

In the U.K, Ella - the daughter of a supermarket heiress and a politician - has been hailed as 'the new Nigella Lawson', but beyond their shared success, and their very pretty faces, Ella admits that her food philosophy couldn't be further from that of Ms Lawson's.

'It’s a gigantic compliment, and a huge honor to know that people see me in that way,' Ella says. 

'And it’s true - our philosophies are very different - but we both love food a lot.'

And while Ella may eschew butter, cream, bacon and all the usual mainstream indulgences, eating vegan, she says, is 'so much more than nut roasts'.

'It can be beautiful, delicious, satisfying, comforting dishes,' she says. 'From butternut squash risotto to creamy coconut porridge, baked falafels, pesto pasta, chocolate cookies, avocado chocolate mousse and berry scones with coconut cream.'

Healed: Ella turned her unhealthy ways around 18 months ago, in a last-ditch attempt to cure herself of a sudden, chronic illness, postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTs) 

A self-confessed former 'sugar monster', who used to gorge on candy and fast food, Ella turned her unhealthy ways around 18 months ago, in a last-ditch attempt to cure herself of a sudden, chronic illness: postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTs).

The little-understood disease affects the nervous system, and, quite out-of-the-blue, left her in constant pain, sleeping for 16 hours a day, riddled with infections and so bloated she had to wear her father’s clothes.

After giving up all animal products and all processed food, however, Ella managed to heal herself, where months in hospital and endless courses of medication failed to do so.

'I haven’t felt symptoms returning since I came off my medication, which is incredible,' she says.

'I’m conscious of the way I live and do things every day that nourish my body. I eat well, I work out, I try to manage stress, I get a good sleep in, and together that does wonders.'

One criticism Ella does face, however, is how expensive her ingredients are.

Many of her recipes require large quantities of expensive nuts, medjool dates and obscure ingredients like psyllium husk powder and maca, for example.

'The baking part can be expensive, but I don’t bake that regularly,' she says. 'The things I cook and eat on a regular basis are really inexpensive.

'I eat mostly seasonal veggies, beans, brown rice and homemade hummus. Then I make big batches of soups and recipes, like my chili and curry, which, again, are pretty inexpensive, and they’re great things to stock your freezer with.'

Asked whether any aspect of her choice to go vegan was related to ethics, or animal welfare, Ella, who wears fur, said no.

'I always say that anyone should adapt my recipes to make it work for them, and if that means adding salmon or chicken, then I’m very supportive of that,' she explains, adding that she has 'learned a lot' about the meat and dairy industry recently, and does see problems with it.

Ella is currently working on two further cookbooks, with plans to spend more time in the U.S. in the near future.

In the meantime, her favorite recipes from her debut book?

'The coconut Thai curry, the cacao and almond butter fudge, and the beetroot and chocolate cake with a coconut frosting,' she says. 'Awesome, and so easy to make.'
