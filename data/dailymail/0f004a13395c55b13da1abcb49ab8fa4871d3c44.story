For squeamish people and picky eaters the appearance of a rainbow-like sheen on roast beef and processed ham has long been taken as confirmation that the meat is spoiled or tainted.

But this commonly held food myth is in fact false.

Over the years there has been enough speculation about the safety of rainbow beef that the Department of Agriculture has sought to set the record straight once and for all.

Beef Rainbow: The USDA has explained that when light hits a slice of meat it splits into colors like a rainbow it is called 'diffraction grating' and is due to the elements present in the meat

On the USDA website under the heading ‘Iridescent Color of Roast Beef’, this strange phenomenon is explained to be in fact perfectly natural and caused by iron and fat that exists in meats such as roast beef and processed ham.

According to the USDA, when light hits a slice of meat it splits into colors like a rainbow due to the elements present in the meat and this is called a ‘diffraction grating’. 

There are also various pigments in meat 
compounds which give it an iridescent or greenish cast when exposed 
to heat and processing.

The same thing essentially occurs when light waves bend or spread around a surface and create a pattern, such as when the light hits the surface of a DVD.

Since the main color created by meat 
diffraction gratings is green, perhaps it isn't surprising that many 
people have traditionally viewed the color as a sign of spoilage.

In
Dr. Seuss's Green Eggs and Ham, the character 'Sam I Am' pesters an 
unnamed character to taste a dish of green eggs and ham. The unnamed 
character declines, claiming to dislike the dish until eventually he 
gives in and tries it and discovers he likes it after all.

Light waves scattered by the regularly spaced protrusions and microfibrils in the meat send colored light in particular directions

The rainbow on beef is similar to that found on a CD or DVD, while green has traditional been associated as a color of food gone bad through children's book like Green Eggs and Ham

The rainbow effect is most commonly 
seen in cooked beef because this is typically sharply sliced against the
grain of the muscle fiber, which, coupled with the moisture in it, 
creates an excellent surface for producing rainbows.

‘The
reason it shows up in roast beef is because the cuts of meat that are 
used in most roast beef are more prone to iridescence, particularly in 
the round,’ Dr. Thomas Powell, Executive Director of the American Meat 
Science Association, told The Atlantic.

So
the next time you turn your nose up at a cut of beef in your local deli
or that's been in your fridge for a couple of days remember it's 
probably fine. The real signs that meat has gone off are if it was slimy
or sticky and have a bad odor.

Next time you turn your nose up at a cut of beef in your local deli because you can see a rainbow on it don't worry it's probably fine for you to eat

A rainbow-like sheen doesn't mean it has gone off and is perfectly normal
