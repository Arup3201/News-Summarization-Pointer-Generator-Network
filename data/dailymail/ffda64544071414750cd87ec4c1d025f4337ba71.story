French First Lady Valerie Trierweiler has been accused of abandoning her socialist principles to embrace a new life of luxury with the wealthy elite.

A critical analysis in a magazine points to her appearance at couture fashion shows while millions of workers face job losses and pay cuts.

The article, in the weekly title VSD, described the 47-year-old left-wing journalist’s appearance with France’s richest man, Bernard Arnault, as a ‘PR disaster’ and an example of her ‘indifference’ to the plight of struggling families.

It suggests she is following the footsteps of former queen Marie Antoinette, who was pilloried for her frivolous lifestyle and beheaded during the French Revolution in 1793.

‘Mixing with the elite has always had the power to anaesthetise the conscience and Valerie Trierweiler clearly hasn’t been able to hold out against this for long,’ it said.

Ms Trierweiler met President Francois Hollande, 57, at a political rally 15 years ago and they have been a couple for five years.

She has sparked frequent controversy for her highly public attacks on Mr Hollande’s previous girlfriend and former presidential candidate Segolene Royal, with whom he has four children.

The weekly magazine VSD went on to say: 'While thousands of French are fighting to avoid redundancy, she attended the fashion shows.

'This woman who professed to be "socialist to her soul" seems to prefer supporting the one industry that has no need of her help - the luxury fashion world.

'It sends out a very mixed message to the millions of voters who elected her partner to office hoping for a change in morals and mentality.

'Instead of choosing to support welders or other workers, she has chosen to offer her presence to Yves Saint Laurent and the entire luxury industry.'
