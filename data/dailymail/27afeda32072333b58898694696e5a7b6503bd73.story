A mother has filed a lawsuit against a psychiatric institute claiming her son who has schizophrenia has been illegally kept in isolation or strapped to a bed for 70 per cent of his time at the facility.

Joanne Minich, from Brookline, Massachusetts, claims that her son Peter’s mental health has significantly deteriorated with more hallucinations and anxiety since he has been held at Bridgewater State Hospital and is demanding that he is transferred to a new facility. 

The complaint filed in Norfolk Superior Court states Peter, 31, has been held in prolonged isolation at and continuously deprived of almost all human contact and exercise for more than 6,300 hours since January 2013 when he moved to the prison for the 'criminally insane.'

Ms Minich, whose son has suffered from paranoid schizophrenia since his late teens, says he had no previous criminal record or history of violent behavior when he was transferred to the Massachusetts facility, which is administered by the state Department of Correction hospital after staff members at another psychiatric hospital filed assault misdemeanor criminal charges against him.

'People say it's a hospital, but it's not a hospital. It's a prison,' Ms Minich, 66 told ABCNews.com.

'I don't think they are helping him at all. It's torture. It looks like a cage you put an animal in.'

Ms Minich says minor incidents such 
as licking the floor, standing on a sink, putting his head in a toilet, 
and touching another inmate has led to her son being repeatedly confined
 to seclusion in a small cell behind a steel door, or placed in 
restraints.

She
 also says that until recently, when her attorney met with Bridgewater 
officials, her intelligent son was deprived of sufficient reading materials, 
suitable clothing, and regular outdoor exercise.

He was only taken out for trips to a 
nearby hospital where he received electric shock treatment.

'It's horrible,' Ms Minich, who works in a special care nursery with premature babies, told ABCNews.com.

'He's
 living with this mental illness and you can't let the system destroy 
him. It's not humanitarian what they are doing to him. He is a difficult
 case. I am not denying that, but it doesn't mean he should be in a 
prison.'

'All I want is him out of there and in a therapeutic environment,' she said of her son who has lost 40 pounds since his arrival

'I am afraid one day I will get the phone call saying he is dead. It's a horrible way to live.'

The suit seeks an injunction to prevent further restraint and to allow Peter to be transferred to another hospital.It states Peter’s mental health is rapidly declining because prison administrators and clinicians have placed him in mechanical restraints for more than 800 hours over 12 months, for as long as 50 consecutive hours, according to the lawsuit.

Peter's parents say their son was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder when he was child, but focused on soccer and hockey.

Ms
 Minich said that when he was 14, Peter began to show signs of mental 
illness and he was moved to a special school where he began to hear 
voices.

Bridgewater hit the headlines in 2009 when Joshua K. Messier, 23, died while guards were placing him in restraints. In surveillance video, two guards can be seen pressing down on Messier¿s back while he was seated on a bed with his hands cuffed behind him, a practice prohibited in state prisons

After Joshua K. Messier's death the state has agreed to pay the family $3 million as part of a settlement

She says that he was diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and hospitalized in 2003 at McLean Hospital until the private insurance 'ran out' .

He was then transferred to Lemuel Shattuck Hospital in Jamaica Plain, a facility
 run by the Massachusetts Department of Correction and Department of 
Mental Health.

After the incident with staff at the facility he was moved to Bridgewater after a court order where he has remained since.

A
 Boston Globe expose resulted in the discipline of six correction 
officials, and the state has agreed to pay the family $3 million as part
 of a settlement.

It 
was also the focus of a 1967 documentary Titicut Follies which showed 
graphic examples of physical abuse by staff and doctors.

'This is worse than anything I saw in Titicut Follies Minich's lawyer, Roderick MacLeish Jr., told ABCNews.com.

'At least they let them out in the yard and they had Christmas parties.'

The DOC said it and the hospital also 
work closely with the Department of Mental Health to transition 
Bridgewater patients, when appropriate, to DMH hospitals.

Bridgewater State Hospital deferred 
comment to the state Department of Correction, which said it is 
'closely' reviewing the complaint and the facts of the case.

'While
 we cannot comment on specific individuals or cases, the use of 
seclusion and restraint at Bridgewater State Hospital (BSH) is a 
clinical decision and one we view as a measure of last resort to protect
 patients from each other, from themselves and to keep staff safe,' the 
DOC said in a statement.

The
 DOC said it has taken steps in recent years to better train staff in 
'de-escalation techniques' to limit instances where those measures are 
necessary.
