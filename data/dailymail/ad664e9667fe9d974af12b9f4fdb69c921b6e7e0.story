A Melbourne woman desperate to meet President Barack Obama has taken serious measures to gain his attention.

Mandy Carter has taken three months off work and is cycling 16,373km – the distance from Melbourne to Washington D.C. – on her exercise bike in the hope that President Obama will hear about her extraordinary effort and come out of the White House and greet her.

'I'm not asking for a dinner with him and Michelle, I'm just asking for a wave,' she told Today.

Ms Carter hopes that her commitment to exercise, something that the Obamas have been vocal about, might win her a brief meeting with them.

Ms Carter, who has two teenage children, has taken three months leave from her job as a carer and is confining herself to her house until the bike ride is complete.

To remind her of the challenge, Ms Carter has tied a rope around her ankle that connects her to the exercise bike.

The rope is long enough that she can move around her house and do chores, but not long enough that she can go outside.

The Melbourne woman has decided to remain housebound until she achieves her goal

Ms Carter's house is adorned with U.S. paraphernalia. Her walls are bedecked with U.S. flags and stars-and-stripes bunting and stickers and her exercise bike sits on a mat made to look like a road, leading toward a cardboard cut-out of the White House and Barack Obama, stuck to her living room wall.

Ms Carter's children, Nicholas and Amy, have taken over the grocery shopping and other tasks outside the home.

'We're not really surprised with what she's doing because she's always coming up with crazy ideas,' Amy told Today.

After she travels to Washington D.C. and – hopefully – gets to meet the president, Ms Carter plans to launch an app to help other people improve their health and fitness.
