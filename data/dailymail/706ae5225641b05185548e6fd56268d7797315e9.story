The school leavers' ball - or prom, as they are increasingly called - is one of the landmark events in a teenage 
girl's life, marking the end of years of hard work.

It has become a crucial rite of passage for teenagers everywhere. But for 16-year-old Terri Calvesbert her school prom was even more significant than most.

Terri was scarred for life in a devastating fire at her home in Ipswich, Suffolk, when she was a two-year-old baby.

Big celebration: Terri Calvesbert, 16, who was scarred for life after being caught in a house fire aged two, dressed up for her school leavers' prom with her friends and said she had a 'wonderful evening'

But as Terri leaves her school days behind and heads off to college in September, she joined her friends from Westbourne Academy at its school prom in Henley at the weekend.

And, of course, there was only one way for the excited teen to arrive in style - in a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce.

Like most other teenagers, she was slightly nervous before the prom, but once on her way, Terri had a great time.

She said: 'It was really nice to be with my friends and with the teachers. It was a wonderful evening.

'There were more than 100 people there and it was just great to have such a good night out.'

Her whole family turned out to see Terri head off to the big evening - father Paul, 40, was joined by his wife Nicky, 45, and grandparents Mick and Margaret.

And when Terri arrived at the school prom at All Manor of Events at Henley she was the star of the show as she was cheered by her school friends.

The teenager is now hoping to relax 
during the summer before learning how she has done in her GCSE exams 
when the results come out next month.

Terri is planning to go on to study animal care at Otley College, 
Ipswich, in September to open the next chapter in her life.

Paul said he had been very proud to see his daughter go off to the prom and enjoy life like any other teenager.

'She loved it.

'She's been a bit tired after a couple of busy days but she's really been able to enjoy herself,' he said.

Terri Calvesbert nearly died from 90 per cent burns after the fire when she was just 23 months old when her mother accidentally left a lit cigarette in her bedroom.

Firefighters attending the scene thought they had found a 'charred doll' when they saw Terri's body. Horrifically, the only part of her body that escaped burns was the patch of skin protected by her wet nappy.

Doctors at specialist burns unit in 
Chelmsford thought Terri Calvesbert, then just 18 months old, would die 
from the burns, but incredibly, she pulled through.

Terri lost her hair, nose and eyelids in
 the devastating blaze.

Her mother, Ms Minter, then 32, was so wracked with guilt after the episode that she cut off almost all contact with her husband and daughter. The two have since discussed the incident and Ms Minter says Terri has forgiven her.

Terri now lives with her 
father Paul, a community fire volunteer and stepmother Nicky.

Ms Minter left the family just two 
months after the accident, and Terri has had more than 50 painful 
operations since then to stretch her scarred skin.

The teenager, who wears a blonde wig, will continue to need surgery and skin grafts for the rest of her life.

Her plight has touched thousands of hearts and donations have poured in from all over the world.
