If Ashley Roberts and her boyfriend plan on tying the knot anytime soon, there's no doubt about what her bridesmaids will be wearing.

The former Pussycat Doll has turned her hand to
 designing once again and this time around she's added a bridesmaid capsule collection to her Key Fashion range.

Speaking to MailOnline about the latest addition to the collection, she said: 'Since being a bridesmaid early this 
year, I wanted to be part of a collection that was perfect for following
 the bride down the aisle.

'If you want to look gorgeous, girly and 
glamorous then Key’s Bridesmaid Capsule is for you; the pastel shades 
are on-trend for Summer 2014.

'The dresses are fun and flirty and unique 
offering a style for everyone'.

Incorporating trends fresh off the catwalk, Ashley promises that her range offers pretty pastel prom and party dresses and glamorous full-length gowns ideal for bridesmaids. 

Priced between £75-£160, Arizona-born
Ashley explains that all of her dresses have all been made using quality fabrics and 
prints with elaborate embellishment to give them a glamorous edge.

Speaking about her style evolution, 
the Dancing On Ice judge explained: 'My style has evolved due to loving 
new styles that come into play but I can always go back to a black 
skinny jean and black leather jacket and feel happy in my down time.'

Ashley
 isn't the only former Pussycat Doll to turn her hand to designing - 
Nicole Scherzinger recently unveiled a range for Missguided.

'I am happy for Nic!,' said Ashley. ' 
Her dresses look fun. We don't usually share style tips with each other.
 If we catch up it's usually about life and boys.'

Aside from designing, Ashley recently launched her debut perfume.

'I
 am also about to launch my music. I have been in the studio recording 
for the last year and am so excited to get back to my roots.'

Ashley is 
currently gearing up the release of her new single Clockwork on May 25, 
with a second single and album to follow in the late summer.

And
 she said she can't wait for her music to hit the shelves: 'I’m super excited to be releasing Clockwork from my new 
album. I’ve got a lot of love for the UK, so it’s great that my music’s 
coming out here first.'

Speaking
 about her plans for the future, Ashley said: 'In five years time I hope
 to have a successful solo career, I'd love to do a romantic comedy 
film, have my own range of fashion, a healthy and happy relationship, a 
house by the water, more involvement with my charities and just living a
 happy life.'
