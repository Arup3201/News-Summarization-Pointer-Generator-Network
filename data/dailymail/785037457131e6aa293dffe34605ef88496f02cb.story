The suicide of a 28-year-old mother is being re-investigated after evidence came to light that suggested she was murdered by her police officer husband.

Ashley Fallis, a mother-of-three, was found dead with a gunshot wound to the head on New Year's Day 2012 at her home in Evans, Colorado. Her husband Tom Fallis was home at the time and made a frantic 911 call pleading for help.

Her death was ruled a suicide by the Evans Police Department and Colorado Bureau of Investigation. 

However her family have never believed that the young mom took her own life. They claim that she was shot dead by her husband Tom Fallis, an officer in the Evans Police Department, who covered up the crime with the help of a colleague.

Two years after her death, the investigation into her death has been re-opened following new information that was discovered by Fox 31.

Evans Police Chief Rick Brandt announced on Tuesday that the case was being reopened and that another police department in Fort Collins would be reviewing the evidence.

Chief Brandt said: 'This new information includes alleged 
eye and ear witness accounts that we were previously unaware of and are 
of a serious enough nature to warrant further investigation in this 
case.'

Mrs Fallis' family claim that witness statements and evidence was tampered with Evans Police Detective Michael Yates.

Statements from witnesses were reportedly changed or omitted including one from the couple's six-year-old daughter who allegedly said she 'saw daddy shoot mommy' and 'I saw daddy getting the gun ready'. 

The testimony of a neighbor Nick Glover, who claims he heard Tom Fallis say that he shot his wife, was omitted from the investigation reports.

Another neighbor Chelsea Arrigo reportedly heard Mrs Fallis pleading with her husband to 'get off' shortly before the shooting.

Police officer Tom Fallis, in a police interview following his wife's death in 2012, denied having anything to do with her death

Tom Fallis has maintained his 
innocence. He angrily denied harming his wife during a police 
interview the morning after her death.

According to the police surveillance 
tape, an interrogator says: 'That wound on the back of her head, isn’t 
what she could do by herself Tom.'

'Bull s***',' he replied.

He also denied a physical altercation with his wife despite his body being covered in scratches.

Photographs from the family home show the gun on the ground covered in blood spatter along with signs of disarray including pictures knocked off walls.

The police officer left Colorado following his wife's death and now lives in Indiana with their three children.

Detective Yates remains on the force but is no longer the department’s spokesman. He refused to comment on the allegations.

Mrs Fallis' mother Jenna Fox and father Joel Raguindin said that they are relieved to have made progress in the fight for justice for their daughter.

Since the night that she died, they have believed that her husband was responsible for her death.

The family had been together at the Fallis' home just hours before for a party. Ms Fox claims Tom Fallis became furiously angry because someone had brought marijuana to the house.

Mr Raguindin told Fox 31: 'Keep continuing to believe and have always believed that at one time the truth would come forth and that time is now.'

Mrs Fallis' mother Jenna Fox and her father Joel Raguindin have battled for two years to have the investigation into her death re-opened
