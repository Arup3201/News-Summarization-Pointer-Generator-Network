A veteran television anchor who was bitten in the face by an 85-pound dog during a live broadcast says she needed 70 stitches in her lips and nose.

Kyle Dyer of Denver's KUSA-TV wrote on her Facebook page over the weekend that she can't talk because her mouth is stitched shut to let a skin graft take and so blood can circulate in her lips again.

The Facebook post says she expects another procedure in the next few weeks.

Attack: In a flash, Max bares his teeth and lashes out at Ms Dyers face. Animal control officers called it a 'pretty major bite.'

Ms Dyer was injured on Wednesday 
while doing an on-air segment with the dog's owner and a firefighter who
had rescued the Argentine Mastiff from an icy pond in suburban Lakewood
the day before.

She was petting the dog's head seconds before it bit her.

Ms Dyer, who had been working at the 
Denver, Colorado station for over 15 years, had reconstructive surgery 
last Wednesday afternoon following the attack, and was released from the hospital Thursday afternoon.

In order to communicate, she is using tools on her iPad to type out messages to loved ones.

Bitten: Ms Dyer was rushed to the local hospital in Denver and has been examined by a trauma team to determine how to repair the damage to her face

Ferocious: Though immediate reports said that he was not properly vaccinated, the owners of the dog have put out a statement saying that he was up-to-date with all of his shots

The dog, whose full name is Warrior Maximus, 
recently survived a harrowing rescue from a freezing pond and was on 
the show as part of a mini-reunion between him and his rescuers.

A
video of Max trying unsuccessfully to find a way out of the pond was 
released last week, and provides some context for the background which 
led him to lash out the next day.

Though immediate reports said that he was not properly vaccinated, the owners of the dog have put out a statement saying that he was up-to-date with all of his shots.

'Max is current in his vaccinations. Max has no history of aggression. Max is a gentle, loving, family dog. Max is well mannered and obedient and he hardly barks,' said the dog's owners The Robinsons in a statement.

Part of the team: Ms Dyer (left) has been 
working for the station for over 15 years, many of which she has 
co-anchored with Gary Shapiro (right)

'Kyle was glad she got assigned to it, because she loves animals,' Mr Shapiro said

Treatment: Ms Dyer is now recovering after surgery Wednesday afternoon at Denver Health Medical Center

'This incident truly is unfortunate and does not reflect Max’s disposition towards people.'

Now, Max has been caged by animal control officers and his owner, Michael Robinson has been fined.

In
addition to comments wishing Ms Dyer well, most Facebook respondents 
left angry messages blaming her for getting too close to the dog.

'I totally agree with all those saying it was her own fault and she should have known better,' wrote Cassandra Hughes Kramer.

'The dog was being a dog, defending 
itself in a stressful situation. He didn't jump on her and maul her, he 
nipped her lip... and she shouldn't have been trying to kiss him. Maybe 
it's a hard lesson to learn, but hopefully she learned it.'

Struggle: Max the dog was filmed swimming around in an icy pool, unable to escape

Rescue: The dog was recovered thanks to a fireman, leading to his ill-fated appearance on the news

A number of viewers also expressed 
concern that the dog would be euthanized as a result of the incident, 
which was something they appeared angry about.

'It was clearly human fault. Why should the animal be blamed for both the owner an kyle's mistake?

Argentine mastiffs, also known as the
Argentine Dogo, are known as big-game hunters and historically have 
gone after wild boars and pumas.

While they are now used as pets, they were bred from a rather violent group of dogs. 

Because of the dogs' violent nature, several areas have banned the breed, including Aurora, Colorado.

Aurora is the neighbouring city to Denver, where the broadcast took place.

The
animal is also banned in New York City public housing, and laws in the 
UK allow police to take the dogs away from their owners and prosecute 
them.

Hope he isn't put down, it would be a crime,' wrote Bruno Naletto.

Brendan Flynn echoed that sentiment, writing: 'Lord knows 9News will hear from all of us and alot more if Max is put down.'

Unless the dog has rabies - which it is not showing signs of - it will not be put down.

Even if the vaccinations are current, the owners will definitely face two charges from Denver Animal Care and Control: a penalty for having the dog bite someone and a second penalty for having the dog off its leash at the time.

'While we normally walk Max on-leash, we understand that by letting him off-leash in an open area away from anyone was still a mistake. We will never walk him off-leash in public areas after this,' the Robinsons said in their statement.

Max was brought into the studio after the station's news chopper captured 
video footage of a firefighter rescuing Max from a freezing pond Monday 
after he fell through the ice and couldn't make it out.

'I know that she is a great journalist
who loves happy stories - this was a happy story,' her co-anchor Gary 
Shapiro said in a note to fans.

'Kyle was glad she got assigned to it, because she loves animals,' Mr Shapiro said.

Though she is out of the hospital, her recovery is just beginning. Ms Dyer, who is married and has children, is expected to take several weeks to return to work.

'She's
doing well, and will make a recovery, and we're all thinking about her 
and her family,' said 9News vice president Patti Dennis.

'Kyle-
of all people!- is the biggest dog lover and even yesterday we were 
talking about how, as dog lovers, we think every dog belongs to us.

'Kyle will be back in a period of weeks- probably several but she will be back.'
