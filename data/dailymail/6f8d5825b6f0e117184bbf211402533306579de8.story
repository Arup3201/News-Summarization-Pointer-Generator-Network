Are you, like many, impatiently awaiting the fifth series of charming period drama Downton Abbey, due to air later this year? If so, a new board game may help fill the void the programme has left.

The £19.95 game, which is based on the upstairs/downstairs lives of
the 1920s characters, is being sold on Amazon.

Described as the 'fast-moving game that transports you into the world of Downton Abbey', gamers play as a maid or footman and have to make their way around the board completing tasks and collecting bells along the way as quickly as possible.

It's playtime, Downton style! As viewers eagerly await the fifth series of the popular ITV show, a board game has been unveiled

The game starts in the servants' hall where each player is dealt 'destination cards' - each of which have varying values indicated by the number of bells on the card; the more bells, the harder the task.

Each player then navigates their way around the corridors and stairs of the famous Abbey by throwing the dice to determine how many moves they can make.

When a player reaches the destination of their task, they are entitled to collect their bell tokens (the idea is to get as many as possible).

But, of course, it isn't all that simple.

Watch out for a 'Carson Card' space - the equivalent to a 'chance' space in Monopoly - which can either help or hinder a player.

Beware the Carson! This card can either help or hinder a player as they navigate the board

Race around the board: Described as the 'fast moving game that transports you into the world of Downton Abbey', gamers move around the board completing tasks and collecting bells

You could end up on a 'Letter' space, which could call a player away from the Abbey, slowing them down or costing them precious bells.

Writing about the game on Amazon, makers says: 'So which route will they take? A short easy looking one to get a job done earning only one bell, or a longer route with the possibility of collecting a higher reward?'

The winner of the game is the player who completes all their jobs and collects the most bells on their way around the game.

The show, which will air later this year, drew in 7m viewers for its Christmas special. 

Tasks: Each player is given tasks as they make their way around the board. The game is the ideal Christmas gift for die-hard Downton fans
