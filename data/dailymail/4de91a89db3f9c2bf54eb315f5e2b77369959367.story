A 16-year-old thug who murdered the father-to-be who escorted him home from a drunken night out has been told he will spend at least 15 years behind bars.

An intoxicated Connor Doughton had already tried to fight a nightclub bouncer and had hurled abuse at a woman on the street when Michael-Lee Emmett and John Williams decided to walk him back to his parents' house in Blackwood, South Wales.

But once home, troubled Doughton ran to the kitchen to grab a knife, before heading outside where he stabbed both Mr Emmett and Mr Williams.

Mr Emmett, who was knifed in the stomach, died four weeks later after having to undergo a liver transplant. Mr Williams survived but suffered a serious stab wound to his back.

Judge Mrs Justice Nicola Davies said an aggravating feature of the offence was that 29-year-old Mr Emmett had been profoundly distressed while doctors tried to save his life at a specialist hospital unit in London.

She also said Mr Emmett's daughter Lola-Grace, who was born just days before his death on September 2, had been robbed of the chance to get to know her father, who also left behind twin boys, Logan and Riley. 

Sentencing Doughton, Mrs Justice Davies also lifted reporting restrictions which had previously prevented him from being named. 

She told the teenager: 'Neither victim did anything to provoke the stabbing. They were doing what they could to take you home, away from any trouble, realising that you were in aggressive frame of mind.

'Nothing they said or did could justify your taking of a knife - still less pursuing them down the road and in turn stabbing each of them.

'In taking the life of Michael Emmett you have robbed twin boys aged eight of their father.

'Lola, his daughter, born when her father was critically ill in King's College Hospital, London, will never know him.

'Michael was excited about his daughter's birth and looking forward to this special event.

'His partner, Natalie Preece, not only lost her much-loved partner and father of her children, she lost a source of strength and support within this close family.

Judge Mrs Justice Nicola Davies told Doughton that in taking Mr Emmett's life he had 'robbed twin boys aged eight of their father'. The boys are pictured with their parents during a family holiday in 2010

'Their losses are devastating; such remorse as you have demonstrated has been limited.'

The incident unfolded on August 1 last year after Mr Emmett and Mr Williams had been smoking outside the Stonehouse pub in Cefn Fforest.

Doughton, a long-time family friend of Mr Williams, was walking along the road and told the pair he had been 'scrapping with bouncers'.

An aggressive Doughton then lost his temper after being told to stop being abusive to a nearby woman.

After Doughton tried to fight Mr Emmett and Mr Williams, the pair decided to take him back home to his father in a bid to prevent any further trouble.

Mrs Justice Davies said: 'As the three of you approached your home, you ran from the two men and went through the front door.

'John Williams and Michael-Lee Emmett turned around and began walking back to the Stonehouse pub. Within a short time you exited the back door and began shouting at Mr Williams and Mr Emmett. Your family were trying to calm you down.

'Unbeknown to the two men in the road, when in the house you had gone in to the kitchen and picked up a kitchen knife.

'Once outside, you approached Mr Emmett and stabbed him in the abdomen, causing a penetrating injury to his liver.'

Mr Williams was also stabbed - in the shoulder, arm and lower back, which caused a serious wound to his bladder.

'You subsequently dropped the knife down a drain ... (and) shortly after you were stopped by police,' added Mrs Justice Davies.

'You gave a false name, denied any knowledge of the knife and spat in the face of a policewoman.'

An injured Mr Emmett was taken to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, before he was transferred to King's College Hospital when the extent of the injury to his liver was discovered.

Following a transplant at the specialist unit, he suffered a 'catastrophic airway bleed' and underwent several painful medical procedures.

'He had an open wound on his stomach that could not be closed, the tracheostomy meant that he was unable to speak,' added Mrs Justice Davies in her sentencing remarks.

'He was attached to a number of machines which caused him distress.

'Until a catastrophic bleed on August 27, Michael Emmett was aware of his surroundings and was distressed by his ill-health.'

Mr Emmett's life support was switched off on September 2.

The court heard that, although Mr Williams survived, he had been left physically and mentally scarred by the attack.

Mrs Justice Davies said: 'He is distressed that a young male he befriended and supported in difficult times had attacked him.'

The court heard in mitigation that Doughton had a low IQ and had had behavioural difficulties since the age of 11.

He was also described as having a 'severe conduct disorder' which had been caused by 'genetic factors not associated with poor parenting'.

The court was also told that Doughton began a spate of offending in 2013 - including criminal damage, battery and assault, as well as numerous breaches of an Asbo.

While Doughton pleaded guilty and his young age was deemed a 'mitigating factor', Mrs Justice Davies decided to make him the subject of a minimum 15-year detention order - three years above the starting point.

She added: 'It is important to emphasise the custodial term is not the actual one for which you will be detained.

'It is the minimum you must serve before you can be considered for release by the Parole Board. The time you serve may actually be longer.

'When you are released, you will remain on license for the rest of your life.'

For the stabbing of Mr Williams, Doughton was given a 24-month detention and training order - which will run concurrently.

After Mrs Justice Davies completed her sentencing, more than 50 members of Mr Emmett's family and friends applauded from the public gallery.

Gwent Police Inspector Nicky Brain said the force's thoughts remained with the victims' families.

He added: 'The sentence today reflects the seriousness of the crime. I hope it provides all of those involved by this terrible act of violence, a degree of closure to help them move on with their lives.'
