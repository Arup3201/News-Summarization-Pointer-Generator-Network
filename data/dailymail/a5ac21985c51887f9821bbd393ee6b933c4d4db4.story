Wayne Rooney will proudly lead out Manchester United against Swansea on Saturday, and in a little over two weeks he could be given an even greater honour.

For the 28-year-old now looks to be the prime candidate to be England's next captain having  been confirmed as United's new skipper on Tuesday. 

Roy Hodgson admitted earlier this week that the man who leads out England at Wembley against Norway on September 3 will replace Steven Gerrard as leader of the national team.

And Rooney looks to be that man now. 

In truth, Hodgson's options are limited with only Joe Hart, Gary Cahill and Phil Jagielka as realistic alternatives to Rooney. 

Another option would be current vice-captain Frank Lampard, but Hodgson seemed to rule him out earlier this week when hinting he may plump for Rooney.

'Frank is the vice-captain and there is Wayne Rooney, so there are two candidates,' said Hodgson. 

'At the moment, Frank's concentration has to be on this Manchester City job and in New York, where he could very well be captain.

'I don't think I can expect him to say, "Please make me captain because in 2018 I want to lead the team out", because I don't think he will be thinking that himself.'

At 28, Rooney will still be around for the next World Cup in Russia. Hart, who will be 31 in 2018, will in all likelihood also be around, but Cahill and Jagielka will be 32 and 35 in four years and may have found themselves usurped by younger centre-backs such as Phil Jones, Jon Stones and Calum Chambers.

That seemingly leaves a straight battle between Rooney and Hart, and United boss Louis van Gaal has done Hodgson a huge favour. 

Had Van Gaal plumped for compatriot Robin van Persie as his captain at United it would have been almost impossible for Hodgson to make Rooney his skipper. 

Passion play: Joe Hart is seemingly the other leading candidate to captain England

Down and out: Gary Cahill is another name that Roy Hodgson is reported to be considering as England skipper

Experienced: Phil Jagielka has captained his club side Everton for many years

Now, however, it is almost impossible for Hodgson not to choose Rooney over Hart - or any other candidates he may be considering. 

Already one of the obvious leaders on the pitch, captaining United week-in-week-out will surely give Rooney the vital experience he needs to lead his country.

What kind of captain he will turn out to be - possibly more David Beckham than John Terry - is still unknown, but he seems to be the only game in town now for Hodgson.
