Sportsmail's Lawrence Booth pinpoints the main statistics and talking points surrounding James Anderson's pursuit of a record ahead of the fifth Test between England and India at the Kia Oval.

Chasing Botham

Jimmy Anderson needs seven wickets to equal the England Test record of 383 held by Ian Botham. Anderson sits joint-15th on the overall list.

Chase: Jimmy Anderson needs seven wickets to equal the England Test record of 383 held by Sir Ian Botham

Indian feast

In terms of wickets taken, India are Anderson’s favourite opponents, providing him with 78 of his Test scalps at 27.46 apiece. On average, his richest pickings have come against Pakistan: 32 wickets at 17.65.

The early bird... 

Anderson's ability to swing the ball both ways, late and at pace, makes it tough for batsmen early on. He has inflicted 52 ducks on Test batsmen (India’s Virender Sehwag, with three, is top) and 125 have failed to reach double figures.

Rabbits in the headlights

His all-time bunny is Australia seamer Peter Siddle, who has fallen 11 times to Anderson in Tests, but some big names are close behind. Anderson has removed Michael Clarke and Sachin Tendulkar nine times, with Shane Watson on eight.

Heartbeat of the team

Anderson has been a reliable barometer of England’s health. He has played in 44 Test wins, in which he has claimed an impressive 207 wickets at 22.63 apiece. But in 29 defeats, his figures are considerably worse: 74 wickets at 46.09 each.

All smiles: Botham shares a joke with Anderson in 2013, but the latter is closing in on his record 

Golden year 

The most wickets Anderson has claimed in a calendar year was the 57 he managed in 2010. But his best yearly average so far belongs to 2014, when his 36 Test wickets have cost just 22.75 apiece.

James' giant haul  

In all, Anderson has bowled to 252 Test batsmen and has dismissed 167 of them. Of his haul of 376 wickets, 247 have been caught, 81 bowled and 48 lbw; 255 of those have been right-handers, with 121 being lefties.
