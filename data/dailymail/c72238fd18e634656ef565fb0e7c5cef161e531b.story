A portrait of Richard III, whose remains will now be laid to rest in Leicester Cathedral following a High Court battle

Richard III will finally be laid to rest at Leicester Cathedral after judges said it was time for the monarch to be given a 'dignified burial'.

Distant relatives opposed plans to bury him in the city after his remains were discovered in a council car park in August 2012.

They said he should be placed in York Minster because it was a wish of 'the last medieval king of England'.

But the High Court told the claimaints, who are part of the Plantagenet Alliance, there was no reason to interfere with the initial plans.

Richard was killed at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485 - ending the Wars of the Roses and the Plantagenet dynasty.

His body was taken to Leicester by supporters of the victorious Henry VII and buried in Greyfriars church, now the site of the council car park.

The Alliance's counsel Gerard Clarke told the court he would be satisfied if a consultation exercise was launched, and suggested the Queen and royal household should be at the top of the list of consultees.

He added the relatives themselves as well as members of the public should be involved because it 'is not just any old bones'.

But Lady Justice Hallett, sitting with Mr Justice Ouseley and Mr Justice Haddon-Cave, ruled there were no public law grounds for interfering with the plans for reburial at Leicester Cathedral.

The three judges said in a joint ruling: 'Since Richard III’s exhumation on September 5 2012, passions have been roused and much ink has been spilt.

'Issues relating to his life and death and place of re-interment have been exhaustively examined and debated.

'The Very Reverend David Monteith, the Dean of Leicester Cathedral, has explained the considerable efforts and expenditure invested by the cathedral in order to create a lasting burial place 'as befits an anointed King'.

'We agree that it is time for Richard III to be given a dignified reburial, and finally laid to rest.'

It is currently unclear whether or not the Alliance will seek to appeal. Any further matters stemming from the judgment will be dealt with at a later date.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling condemned the Alliance legal action, saying it had 'taken up so much time and money'.

Mr Grayling said: 'I have been very clear from the start that the decision to grant an exhumation licence for Richard III was taken correctly and in line with the law.

'I am pleased the court has reached the same conclusion and comprehensively rejected all of the claimant’s arguments.

'I
 am, however, frustrated and angry that the Plantagenet Alliance - a 
group with tenuous claims to being relatives of Richard III - have taken
 up so much time and public money.

'This case, brought by a shell company
 set up by the Alliance to avoid paying legal costs, is an example of 
exactly why the Government is bringing forward a package of reforms to 
the judicial review process.'

There
 was applause at Leicester Cathedral as Bishop of Leicester Tim Stevens 
read out the result at 10am to a crowd of supporters and media.

'We
 are, of course, delighted. Here in the cathedral, in the diocese, in 
the city, in the county, we’ve waited a long time for this.'

He said plans for the reinterment that had been on hold could now progress.

Distant relatives wanted Richard to be buried at York Minster, claiming it was a dying wish of the last medieval king, who was known as 'Richard of York'

Richard was born on in 1452 at Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire. Scientists found he had a curved spine and was riddled with roundworm

Richard was born in 1452 at Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire.

During the War of the Roses, Richard's father, Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York was killed and in 1470, Richard and his brother Edward were exiled when Henry VI, from the rival house of Lancaster, took back the throne.

Henry's reign was short lived and during a battle the following year, Edward became king.

In 1483, Edward died and Richard was named as protector of the realm for Edward's son and successor, the 12-year-old Edward V.

Edward V and his brother Richard were placed in the Tower of London and after a campaign to condemn the deceased king's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, the princes were declared illegitimate.

Richard III took to the throne the following day.

He was crowned in July and in August that year, the two princes disappeared, Rumours spread the king had killed them to remove any threat they may have posed to his reign.

In 1485, Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond launched an attack on Richard III on Bosworth Field in Leicestershire.

Many of Richard III's key lieutenants defected and he was killed in battle. Henry Tudor took the throne as Henry VII.

It has been confirmed that Richard III had a curvature of the spine, although rumours of a withered arm haven't been verfied form the bones found in the Leicester car park last year.

Last year scientists discovered the king was riddled with roundworm after finding large numbers of the parasite’s eggs in soil taken from Richard III’s pelvic region. The find suggests that the king’s intestines were infected with roundworm during his life.
