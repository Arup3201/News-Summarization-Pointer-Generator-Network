Police have today renewed warnings about the dangers of trespassing on railway property after a man died of horrific burns after he grabbed onto power lines while trying to graffiti trains in Brisbane last night.

The 26-year-old suffered a massive electric shock and 90 per cent burns to his body when he grabbed onto the lines carrying 450,000 volts.

Queensland Police are investigating the shocking incident which took place at a  railway yard on Lofter Street in Tennyson, south Brisbane. 

The 26-year-old man touched one of these train cables at the railway shunting yard  in Tennyson, south Brisbane on Saturday night 

The incident happened in Tennyson and the trespasser was from the Greenbank suburb of Brisbane 

The Greenbank man entered the rail shunting yard about 8.30pm last night with a 19-year-old friend and the pair were trying to graffiti train carriages. 

The 26-year-old climbed onto one of the carriages, he raised his hands and touched electrical wires and he then suffered an electric shock.

A Queensland Police spokesman said: 'While scaling a container car he brushed against the wires, suffering deep thickness burns to 90 per cent of his body.' 

Police said the man was taken to Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital for life-threatening burns but later died of his injuries. 

Queensland Rail (QR) is helping police with their investigation and they told ABC that the site is leased the site to rail freight company Pacific National, which was responsible for security in the area. 

Daily Mail Australia tried to contact Pacific National without success and QR said they would not be making any comments on the incident due to the police investigation. 

Police have renewed warnings for people not to trespass on railway property after the latest tragedy  

Regional duty officer Inspector Daniel Bragg renewed warnings about the dangers of trespassing on the railways during a press conference this morning. 

This incident comes two months after the death of another man linked to graffiti on Brisbane trains. 

Inspector Bragg told the media that emergency crews were already at the scene when police arrived and staff at the shunting station saw a flash or flame, they found the man sitting on top of the carriage.

The man's friend who he entered the shunting yard with called emergency services. 

Police say railway shunting yards are 'dangerous places' and warned people to stay away from them 

Inspector Bragg said: 'It's just a terrible, terrible thing and police hate going to jobs like this and the sad thing about it is this could be so easily avoided. 

'Railway lines and railway shunting yards are very dangerous places - police are often called to jobs where people have been injured or killed on properties like this.

'You don't have to actually touch the lines to be electrocuted. You just have to be in close proximity.

'The message here is quite simple: don't go near train lines,' reports ABC.

The man's friend is currently assisting police with their enquiries as they continue to investigate the incident.
