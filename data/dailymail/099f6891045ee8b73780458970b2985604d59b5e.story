It's been a big month for former Wallabies coach Ewen McKenzie.

After a nail-biting loss to the New Zealand All Blacks during the Bledisloe Cup at the weekend McKenzie stepped down as the Australian Rugby Union team's coach.

Now in the weeks to come McKenzie's multi-million dollar property will go under the hammer as he attempts to sell he and wife Sally's beachside Coogee penthouse for the second time in just over a year. 

McKenzie's shock decision came at the end of a horror fortnight for the Wallabies, during which star player Kurtley Beale had a mid-air row with team business manager Di Patston.

This comes amid a scandal which saw star Wallabies player Kurtley Beale dumped from the side

It was later revealed Beale had sent a string of offensive text messages about Patston. The scandal led to the staffer standing down from her role and Beale being dumped from the side indefinitely. 

McKenzie's four-bedroom abode with stunning ocean views was originally put on the market in September 2013 according to RP Data. It was purchased for $2,825,000 three years earlier.
