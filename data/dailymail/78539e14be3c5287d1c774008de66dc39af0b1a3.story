Charged: April Emery was arrested after her children were found wandering the streets selling toys 

An Osceola County, Florida mother has been arrested after authorities said they found her two young daughters going door to door trying to sell their toys.

The Osceola County Sheriff’s Office says the girls, ages 7 and 9, were walking barefoot about a half-mile from their home about 10:30 a.m. Thursday.

The girls told deputies they were selling their toys 'to help mommy stay in the house.'

The girls had missed a 7:20 a.m. bus to school, deputies said.

The deputies found the mother, April Emery, at home sleeping.

According to investigators, when deputies woke her up she said she blamed her daughters for not waking her up at school time.

WTSP reports that Emery did not seem to be concerned about her daughters' well being.

When deputies told her they found her daughters walking around, she told them, 'Well they should know better, it's their job to wake me up in the morning to get ready for school.'

Emery was charged with child neglect without great bodily harm.

The arrest was reported to the state Department of Children and Families, which had investigated previous allegations of poor child care at the home.

According to the sheriff’s office, the home had running water, electricity and food, and the girls were were wearing clean clothes and had toys 'to keep them entertained.'

The girls are now staying with a family member.
