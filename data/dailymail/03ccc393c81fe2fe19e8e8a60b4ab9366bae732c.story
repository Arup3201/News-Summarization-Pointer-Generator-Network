A top horse rider has died after suffering a heart attack while taking part in an international equestrian event in the South West.

Jordan McDonald, 30, who was based in Leicestershire but originally from Canada, suffered a cardiac arrest as his horse took on the jumps at Nunney International Horse Trials in Somerset.

The prestigious annual event attracts some of the most famous names in the world of horse riding - including royal Zara Phillips.

The royal rider took part in trials
 at the three-day event near Frome yesterday, but is thought to have returned to 
London today to attend the annual Trooping the Colour parade.

An ambulance, air ambulance and doctor were sent to the scene in the grounds of Southfield House in Nunney at around 1.38pm following today's incident.

A South Western Ambulance Service spokesman confirmed Mr McDonald suffered a cardiac arrest before falling from his horse and suffering fatal injuries.

He was taken to Royal United Hospital in Bath, but could not be revived.

He married his long-term girlfriend and fellow competitive rider Shandiss Wewiora last year.

Around 800 horses were set to take part in the elite event this weekend, but organisers were forced to suspend the trials following the tragedy. The event is expected to resume as normal tomorrow.

A spokesman for British Eventing this evening confirmed Mr McDonald's death and paid tribute to the popular rider.

A statement said: ‘It is with the deepest regret that we announce that Mr Jordan McDonald died today as a result of a fatal accident whilst competing at Nunney British Eventing Affiliated One Day Event in Somerset.

‘Jordan's horse, "Only Me", a 7 year old gelding, was not injured.'

Nunney International confirmed trials would be suspended following the incident.

A spokesman said: 'We regretfully announce a Canadian rider has been killed as a result of a rotational fall during the cross-country section.

‘Due to this serious incident, the remaining sections' trials have been cancelled for the day.’

Horse riding fan Samantha Elton, 44, who attended today’s event, said everyone at the trials had been shocked by the tragedy.

She said: ‘There are risks which come with horse riding, but it is still nevertheless a big shock when a rider dies after falling from a horse.’

News of the death came as a shock to the equestrian world which learned only hours earlier that a top German rider had died at an event near Hamburg.

Benjamin Winter, 25, died after falling from his horse as it jumped a fence at the Luhmühlen Horse Trials earlier today.

Ms Elton added: ‘Only earlier on I had heard that (German rider) Benjamin Winter died following a fall at the Luhmuhlen.

‘So, to be here and learn a Canadian rider has died...well it just sends shivers down your spine. Two deaths in the sport on the same day is pretty unheard of.’

Several people also took to Twitter this afternoon to pay tribute to the two horse riders killed in the separate accidents today.

Otto Klaver posted: ‘Black day for eventing with major tragic incidents at both Luhmuhlen &Nunny Horse Trials. Condolences to all involved.’

Katherine Stevens ‏said: ‘My thoughts are with the families of Mr Jordan McDonald & Mr Benjamin Winter who suffered fatal falls today at Nunney and Luhmuhlen’

Meanwhile Charlotte Rampton said: ‘So sad, RIP to Benjamin and Liberal at Luhmuhlen horse trials and the Canadian rider at Nunny international horse trials :(‘
