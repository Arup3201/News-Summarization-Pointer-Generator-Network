Getting kids looking spick and span and sitting still for a family portrait is never an easy task but it's even tougher when you have to do it with baby orangutans.

But renowned wildlife photographer Mitsuaki Iwago managed to wrangle this cheeky group together long enough to take these photographs.

The 62-year-old snapper travelled all the way to Borneo from his home in Tokyo, Japan, to meet these rehomed orphans - aged one to three - who, in the absence of their parents, have learned to love each other as siblings.

These orphaned orangutans were photographed at a rescue centre in Borneo. Although they have lost their parents, that have bonded as if they were siblings

Mr Iwago, who spent the trip photographing orangutans both in the wild and - as with the orphans - at the Orangutan Foundation International rescue centre, said: 'I decided to visit Borneo because I heard the main habitat for these rare animals, the forest, has been disappearing rapidly due to deforestation.

'I wanted to see how they live in the wild with my own eyes.

'Because of the fast pace of deforestation activities, the total number of wild orangutans has been decreasing rapidly.

'At the same time the number of orphans, who have seen their habitat being destroyed, has been increasing dramatically.

'Orangutans are peaceful animals who love to live quietly.

Deforestation has destroyed the animals' homes and decimated their population

A baby orangutan studies its mother's mouth, learning how she uses it to perform different tasks. It can take up to eight years for a mother to fully raise her young

'Although there are community activities, they always strive to avoid unnecessary social tensions.

'As I press the shutter of my camera, I wish the forest, which has provided orangutans with a safe and abundant environment since time immemorial, remains a place where future generations can prosper and live in peace.'

Over the last 60 years, Borneo's orangutan population has fallen by more than half, with less than 69,000 being left on the island.

In just the last two decades, the rainforests where the animals live have been stripped back by 55 per cent.

Mr Iwago also photographed a young orangutan observing his mother's mouth at Tanjung Putting National Park.

He said: 'An infant always plays with their mother's mouth and observe how they use it to accomplish various tasks.

'It takes about 6 to 8 years for a female orangutan to raise an infant.

'They build comfortable nest structure in the forest canopy, and stay together living a quiet and peaceful life until the babies become independent.

'It is fairly uncommon to encounter a group with several babies in the wild.'

The Orangutan Foundation International was established in 1986 by conservationist Dr Birute Mary Galdikas, who has experience in forest and orangutan protection.

She wanted to protect the animals who have become orphans as a result of deforestation.
