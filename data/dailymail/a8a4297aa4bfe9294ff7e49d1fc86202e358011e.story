Graeme Souness insists there is no way back for Mario Balotelli at Liverpool and that this has been his last chance at a top club.

The striker has been lambasted for swapping shirts with Real Madrid defender Pepe at half time when Liverpool were being thrashed 3-0.

But it is not the first time he has made himself the target of stinging criticism in only two months since he made a £16million switch from AC Milan.

Souness is adamant that Balotelli will not be handed another chance at a top European club 

The Italian striker has yet to score a Premier League goal since his £16million move to Merseyside 

Balotelli defied manager Brendan Rodgers' orders to applaud away fans after their shock 1-0 defeat at Basle in the Champions League and supporters' patience is starting to wear thin with his work-rate and lack of commitment on the field.

Asked if Balotelli can recover from this latest mistake, former Liverpool captain Souness said: 'I don't think so. You have to look at the quality of the people who've tried before and failed and held their hands up and said they can't do it.

'Roberto Mancini twice had a go at it, with Inter Milan and Manchester City. Jose Mourinho quickly made his mind up that he wouldn't want to work with him again while he was at Inter.

'Cesare Prandelli said after the World Cup he got it wrong, he said he made a mistake and shouldn't have taken him with Italy.

'There has been a criticism from day one. It was a very brave move by Rodgers. He obviously felt his managerial skills could stop the problem. It's not worked for him and it's not worked for the football club.'

Souness is adamant that Balotelli, still only 24, will not be handed another chance at one of the big clubs in Europe's top four leagues.

Balotelli has played for some of world football's heavyweights - Inter, Manchester City, AC Milan and now Liverpool - and has won three Serie A titles, one Premier League title, a Champions League medal and numerous other trophies.

But Souness added: 'This is his last chance at a big club in one of the big leagues. He could go to Russia or somewhere like that. That's what he's looking at, he's looking down the barrel of that right now.' 

Graeme Souness was speaking on behalf of Capital One, credit card company and sponsor of the League Cup.
