Facing the prospect of a humiliating Stanley Cup sweep at the hands of the Los Angeles Kings Wednesday night, New York Rangers goalie Henrik Lundqvist made a heroic 40 saves to help propel his team to its first win of the series - forcing a Game 5.

But in the end, the the Rangers were rescued from almost certain elimination on their home ice by a tiny pile of snow.

With 1.11 left in the game, the puck slid past Lundqvist, on the way to tie up a 2-1 game.

And then, miraculously, it stopped - a millimeter short of the goal line, bogged down in a tiny mound of snow that had been piled up at the mouth of the goal.

The goal would have sent the game into overtime - a prospect that did not favor the beleaguered Rangers, who lost their first two games to the Los Angeles Kings in overtime  

Had the Kings tied the game and sent the match into overtime, the prospects for the Rangers weren't good. The first two games of the Stanley Cup finals went into overtime and the Rangers skated away with loss both times.

'I've been in the game a long time to know that sometimes the hockey 
gods are there. They were there tonight,' declared Rangers head coach Alain Vigneault.

Lundqvist was less philosophical.

'I move around a lot and stay deep in the net, so there’s a lot of snow there,' the goalies told reporters after the game, smiling slyly.

The Rangers face an uphill battle if they want to stay in contention. Down 3-1. the Kings need just one more win to take home the Stanley Cup.

But at least Rangers fans didn't have to watch the Kings hoist the trophy on their own ice at Madison Square Garden. At lest the the Rangers managed to draw blood in their first Stanley Cup appearance in 20 years.

Only four team in NHL history have climbed out of a 3-0 deficit to win a best of seven series. It's only happened once in the Stanley Cup finals - the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs.

However, the most recent example of this come-from-behind tenacity was... this year's Los Angeles Kings team, who took four straight games from the San Jose Sharks in the playoffs.
