Billionaire Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen has finally sold his Puget Sound private island after it spent nearly a decade on the market.

Allan Island, named for a Navy hero and not its former owner, spans 292 acres and is one of Washington's San Juan Islands. The billionaire purchased the island in 1992.

It first listed for $25 million in 2005. On December 20, it sold to an undisclosed buyer for just $8 million.

Sound investment? Paul Allen has sold this Puget Sound private island after it spent nearly a decade floundering on and off the market

The island last listed publicly in 2011 for $13.5 million.

It's only accessible by private plane, boat or float plane.

According to Realtor.com, the island features a grass airstrip, private dock and partial breakwater.

Allen bought the island in 1992 to build a vacation home, but never followed through with the plan after spotting a 387-acre plot on nearby Lopex Island and scooping that up instead.Â 

Allen, 60, made much of his fortune as a co-founder of Microsoft. He's been a friend of Bill Gates' since they were young boys

Allan island has a log home for its caretakers quarters and has 44 seperate tax lots, according to Windermere Real Estate Orcas Island.

'The vision for this property is it will be a small community for good friends and family,' Tere Foster with Windermere told the Seattle Times.

She said the new owner plans to put 10 to 12 homes on the island.

Paul Allen was worth nearly $16 billion as of September, according to Forbes.

He made his fortune as, among other things, one of the founders of Microsoft.

He owns the Seattle Seahawks and Portland Trailblazers.

The island sold for $8 million of December 20, well below its first asking price of $25 million back in 2005
