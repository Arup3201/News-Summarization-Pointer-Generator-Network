A sprawling  estate owned by the late Listerine heiress Bunny Mellon and visited by the Kennedys and royalty has gone on the market for $70 million.

Oak Spring Farms  in Upperville, Virginia is up for sale six months after the 103-year-old  horticulturist passed away from stomach cancer at the estate.

The 4,000-acre estate includes a 10,000 square-foot-mansion, where guests, including John F. Kennedy, Jacqueline Kennedy, the Queen and Prince Phillip, would have enjoyed Mellon's extensive art collection, including works by Mark Rothko and Pablo Picasso.

Bunny and her husband Paul Mellon, himself a wealthy heir, had numerous homes across the world, but they spent most of their time at Oak Spring, the Washington Post reported. 

Up for sale: Bunny Mellon passed away in March and now the 4,000-square-acre estate, some of which is pictured, is up for sale for $70 million. It includes a mansion and more than 20 cottages

Paul Mellon built the main mansion in 1941 and after their marriage in 1948, the couple built a small cottage on the property where they lived.

Instead, the main house was used to exhibit their large art collection, which is being auctioned off in November by Sotheby's when it could fetch more than $100 million.

There are three primary residences on the property, as well as more than 20 cottages - including the guest house where the Kennedys stayed - and multiple barns and shops, according to its listing.

There are also garages, a pond, a stream, a working dairy farm, a clock tower, a pool house and even a private air strip.

Photos taken by Architectural Digest also reveal an extensive library inside.

Extensive gardens and greenhouses at the property  reveal Bunny's passion for gardening, while a bronze statue of Kentucky Derby winner Sea Hero and two stables with 43 stalls are also a nod to Paul Mellon's love for breeding top race horses.

The Mellons' main home, the cottage, is not part of the sale.

The home, 100 acres of land and Bunny's horticultural library were bequeathed to the Gerard B. Lambert Foundation, a philanthropic nonprofit named after her father. 

Her wealth first came from Listerine, which her grandfather Jordan Lambert invented, before she married banker Paul Mellon, who inherited his own fortune from his father Andrew Mellon, himself a banker and philanthropist, as well as the Secretary of the Treasury between 1921 and 1932. 

Well-connected: She is pictured with Jacqueline Kennedy in 1961. The two women became firm friends and Mellon, a self-taught horticulturist, designed the Rose Garden and flowers for John F. Kennedy's funeral

The couple - one of the wealthiest in America at the time of their 1948 marriage - delved into a life of philanthropy and supporting the arts. 

Bunny was invited to the White House soon after JFK was elected, and the  first lady leaned on her for  tips on interior design and entertaining that became a hallmark of the Kennedy White House.

Bunny and Jackie were such close friends that Mellon chartered the private jet that flew the two women to Martin Luther King Jr.'s funeral after his 1968 assassination.

She also redesigned the Rose Garden after decades of neglect and she designed the floral arrangements for President Kennedy's funeral a few years later.

She entertained Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip at Oak Spring in 1957 and years later, she also played host to Prince Charles and Princess Diana.

Bunny's husband died in 1999, aged 91, and she shied away from the spotlight until her death in March. She also became blind in her later years.

Despite long trying to avoid publicity, she was thrust back into the public spotlight as a major donor to the now-disgraced John Edwards' failed 2008 presidential bid.

Edwards was indicted in 2011 for using what prosecutors alleged was campaign money, including $750,000 from Mellon, to hide mistress Rielle Hunter and their child during his 2008 campaign.

When she died, she left her fortunes to charities including the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond.

Her grandchildren were left money, real estate and benefits of a family trust, while a worker who helped her run her properties was granted lifetime occupancy of a farmhouse.
