Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt took a tumble as she tripped at the foot of a flight of steps while attending today's Paris rally.

The blonde was left on her hands and knees after slipping as she left the Elysee Palace, where world leaders attending the march through the French capital had gathered.

Ms Thorning-Schmidt, 48, who had been wearing a perilously high pair of heeled boots, had to be helped to her feet by aides after falling as she left the meeting.

It is not the first time mother-of-two Ms Thorning-Schmidt has gained the attention of photographers during a prestigious event.

In December 2013, she was seen taking a selfie with US President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron during Nelson Mandela's memorial service.

The three world leaders were sitting alongside one another at the service in Johannesburg when they leaned in to take the smiling self-portrait.

Ms Thorning-Schmidt, who is married to former Labour leader Neil Kinnock's son Stephen, and Mr Obama were also seen laughing and chatting during the ceremony, while his wife Michelle looked on, seemingly unimpressed. 

Defending her actions, Thorning-Schmidt said: 'There were lots of pictures taken that day, and I just thought it was a bit fun. Maybe it also shows that when we meet heads of state and government, we too are just people who have fun.'

Ms Thorning-Schmidt was among the dozens of world leaders who stood arm in arm as they led a defiant march through Paris in the wake of the terror attacks that shocked the French capital.

Families of some of the 17 victims were also among the crowds which descended on the city from across the globe to show their solidarity with Parisians mourning the deaths.

Mr Cameron, France's president Francois Hollande and other European leaders broke into spontaneous applause amid cheers, chants of 'Charlie, Charlie' and choruses of the French national anthem La Marseillaise as the march got under way from the Place de la Republique.

Ahead of the rally, Mr Hollande had declared: 'Today, Paris is the capital of the world.

'Our entire country will rise up toward something better.'

As the crowds swelled in a surge of unity, an unprecedented security operation saw more than 5,000 police and soldiers deployed to the streets as France remained on high alert.

Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas were also among the leaders attending, as were top representatives of Russia and Ukraine.

Rallies also took place in London, Madrid and New York - all previously attacked by al Qaida-linked extremists - as well as Cairo, Sydney, Stockholm, Tokyo and elsewhere.

'We are all Charlie, we are all police, we are all Jews of France,' Prime Minister Manuel Valls had declared, referring to the victims of the attacks that included employees at the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, shoppers at a kosher supermarket and three police officers.

The three days of terror began on Wednesday when brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi stormed the newsroom of Charlie Hebdo, killing 12 people. Al Qaida's branch in Yemen said it directed the attack by the masked gunmen to avenge the honour of the Prophet Mohammed, a frequent target of the weekly's satire. The following day an accomplice, Amedy Coulibaly killed a policewoman on the outskirts of Paris and on Friday, the attackers converged.

While the Kouachi brothers holed up in a printing plant near Charles de Gaulle airport, Coulibaly seized hostages inside a kosher market. It all ended at dusk Friday with near-simultaneous raids at the printing plant and the market that left all three gunmen dead. Four hostages at the market were also killed.

Five people who were held in connection with the attacks were freed late last night, leaving no one in custody, according to the Paris prosecutor's office. The widow of the man who attacked the kosher market is still being sought and was last traced near the Turkey-Syrian border.

Earlier, police in Germany detained two men suspected of an arson attack against a newspaper that republished the Charlie Hebdo cartoons. No one was injured in that attack.
