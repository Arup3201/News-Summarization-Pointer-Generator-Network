A California judge told a man who killed an 18-year-old girl that he had a depraved heart, as she sentenced the killer to life in prison without parole.

Dustin Gran was found guilty in March of bludgeoning Krista Pike to death with a dumb bell five years ago, allegedly as a favor to a jealous teenager.

The family of Miss Pike, who had just celebrated her engagement when she was murdered, hugged and smiled outside the courtroom after the sentencing.

He declined the chance to address the court, or his victim's family, before Judge Marie Sovey Silveira told him he had acted with malice as she sentenced him on Friday.

One of the victim's relatives addressed the court, telling Gran: 'You have taken from us someone beautiful, kind and loving.'

Miss Pike's family had asked for Gran to be given life without parole, and the judge agreed, saying it was the right decision, Your Central Valley reported.

She said that Gran had a depraved heart and never shown any remorse, then added: 'The evidence proved 
that Mr Gran committed this murder because he want to.'

As the case, which had taken five years to be heard, came to an end, Miss Pike's family were seen hugging and smiling.

'It feels like a large weight has been 
lifted off our shoulders; it's given us the opportunity for closure,' MIss Pike's father, Russel, said.

'Birthdays, anniversaries, holidays were all changed [when Krista died],' he added.

In court, he told the judge: 'I miss her laugh, her smile, her marshmallow cheeks and most of all, her hugs,' ABC 30 reported.

Miss Pike's brother, also named Russel, was 14 when she was murdered. He told the court how the family struggled in to cope in the days after her death.

'I remember waking up to the sound of my mom crying. We didn't do much other than eat, sleep and cry,' Russel Jr said.

The murder had received so much attention that the trial had to be moved from Miss Pike's home town of Madera, to Modesto.

Her family and attorneys were also bound by a gag order, preventing them commenting on the trial.
