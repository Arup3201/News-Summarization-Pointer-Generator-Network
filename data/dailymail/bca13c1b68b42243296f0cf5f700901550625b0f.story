Bladder conditions caused by excessive use of the drug ketamine are more common in the UK than any other country in Europe, according to a leading doctor.

Mr David Gillatt, medical director of the Bristol Urological Institute at Southmead Hospital, said that heavy use of the drug – which gives users an out of body experience – is causing more people to lose their bladders and end up on dialysis.

'K bladder' - as it is dubbed - has forced him to remove addicts' bladders completely, he said.

The Home Office has estimated there were 120,000 regular users of the drug in Britain last year.

And the most recent global drugs survey conducted by MixMag magazine suggests the UK has more ketamine users than the rest of Europe.

Mr Gillatt said: 'Physical damage due to ketamine is almost unknown in the rest of Europe and large parts of the world even though it is used as a club drug. It's a vicious cycle for some people.

'Unless you help them break the cycle and deal with the pain, they will never come off it.

'Some people are going to turn up in the future with kidney failure too because they have been damaging themselves for so long and not doing anything about it.

'Research we've done and surveys show there's a relationship between how much you take and how long. 

'If you're taking it every day and you're taking large amounts; three, four, five, six grams a day then almost everybody's got problems.'

The drug is a powerful general anaesthetic which stops a person feeling pain.

Small doses can make a person feel floaty and dreamy, while larger doses can give powerful hallucinations.

People report they feel like they have crossed into another world, sometimes known as going 'into the K-hole'.

Extreme ketamine use can injure the bladder, causing ulcers and fibrosis, which means a stiffening and shrinking of the bladder walls.

Patients often struggle with severe pain and difficulty in passing urine or bleeding from the bladder.

Ketamine was upgraded to a Class B drug from Class C substance in February.

The maximum penalty for possession is now five years in prison and 14 years for supply.

One former ketamine user, a 28-year-old from Bristol who wants to remain anonymous, said his problems with the drug were so bad that he tried to take his own life.

'It's an evil drug that strips you down physically.' he said.

Initially taking it with friends at clubs and parties in Bristol, it soon 'got hold of him'.

He said: 'Everyone around me started getting stomach cramps and getting really ill.

'All the other drugs pretty much went out of the window. It just became a constant wanting to escape.

'I hated being me. I think I was trying to kill myself without actually giving up.'

The man developed K bladder after taking as much as 15g of the drug a day.

He said the pain got so bad for him that he 'woke up on the bathroom floor covered in blood, fitting because the pain had got so bad'.

He added: 'I eventually got into heroin because it was the only thing that got anywhere near to easing the pain that ketamine caused.'
