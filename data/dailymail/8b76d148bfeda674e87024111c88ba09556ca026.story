Esme Smith has refused to answer police questions after she was found in North London 11 days after going missing

A 14-year-old schoolgirl who went missing for 11 days is refusing to speak to police after she was found safe earlier this week.

Esme Smith, from Farnham, Surrey, was spotted in North London after a member of the public recognised her from media reports about her disappearance.

She had not been seen since 11 days previously when she left school with friends. She told them she was travelling to nearby Woking but instead got on a train to London's Waterloo station, where she was caught on CCTV.

She has now been interviewed by officers but has not answered questions as to her whereabouts or who she has been with, a Surrey Police spokesman has said.

The spokesman said she has also not returned home to her parents Nato commander Mark, 50, and Dinah, 39.

The force has said there have been no allegations of any criminal activity and there is no evidence Esme has been groomed.

CCTV images of the teenager at Waterloo show she had changed out of her school uniform and into a white flowery dress. She was also wearing a blue denim jacket and was carrying a black school bag and black floral bag with chain straps.

Her 19-year-old sister Sian last week made an emotional appeal to the missing girl, saying: ‘Esme, if you are reading this, I just want to say please come home or at least get in touch so that we know that you are safe.

‘We are all really worried about you and we just want to make sure you are OK. You are not in any trouble so please just get in touch.’

Esme was discovered in London after going missing from her home in Surrey

More than 4,000 people had 'liked' a Facebook page called Find Esme Smith, dedicated to raising awareness of the girl's disappearance.

Her father Mark Smith, who works at Nato’s Joint Warfare Centre in Norway, said he was 'worried sick' about his teenage daughter.

Esme is a pupil at All Hallows Catholic School in Farnham, where she was last seen by friends at the end of the school day on September 12.

After she was found, Detective Superintendent Jon Savell thanked the public and the media for their assistance in helping to find Esme.
