It's not often Dame Vera Lynn can be found in the company of rappers Pharrell and 50 Cent.

But that’s precisely where the Forces’ Sweetheart found herself at the weekend when her latest album entered the charts at number 13.

Vera Lynn: National Treasure was released on Monday to mark the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings and features 40 wartime songs, including We’ll Meet Again and The White Cliffs of Dover.

It has propelled the 97-year-old to the position of oldest living artist to ever feature so highly on the chart. Her last major musical feat was five years ago when she became the oldest person to top the album chart, at the age of 92.

Dame Vera said: ‘I am delighted of course. It is wonderful to hear these songs again that were at the top of the charts so long ago, and it’s warming to think that everyone else is listening to them too.’

The veteran singer made her professional debut at the age of seven, and was also the first British artist to top the US charts with Auf Wiedersehen, Sweetheart in 1952.

Now her latest album is beating the likes of Pharrell, the Arctic Monkeys and rapper 50 Cent whose new album missed out on the top 20.

Solo star Sam Smith retained his hold at the top of the chart with The Lonely Hour this week, while singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran achieved his first UK number one single with Sing.

Sheeran's single, which was co-written and produced by US star Pharrell, sold nearly 124,000 copies over the last seven days, according to the Official Charts Company.

It knocked Sam Smith's Stay With Me off the top spot, with the 22-year-old's track slipping to number two.

A charity single inspired by teenage cancer victim Stephen Sutton also stormed into the top 20. Hope Ain't A Bad Thing by The Neon Brotherhood finished in 16th place.

Tom Drover from Neon Sound Studios, who played guitar on the track, said: 'The idea was hatched when Stephen posted his thumbs up picture. We all decided to come together to do something for Ste, one of the things on his bucket list was to have a charity single.'

Stephen, 19, raised millions of pounds for Teenage Cancer Trust before his death last month and all the profits from the song will go to the charity.
