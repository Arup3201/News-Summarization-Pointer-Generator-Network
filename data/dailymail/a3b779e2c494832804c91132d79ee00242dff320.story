The nurse who apparently took her own life following the royal hoax call scandal was found hanged in her staff housing, it has been claimed.

Mother-of-two Jacintha Saldanha, 46, left a note for her family, it was revealed yesterday.

She had not told her husband or children that she was involved in the incident, meaning the letter may provide their only clue to what prompted the respected nurse to take such a drastic and tragic step.

Prime Minister David Cameron said today that ‘many lessons’ must be learned from the tragedy.

He told MPs: ‘She clearly loved her 
job, loved her work, cared deeply about the health of her patients and 
what has happened is a complete tragedy. There will be many lessons that
 need to be learned.’

A post-mortem examination was held 
yesterday on the body of Mrs Saldanha, who was the first unwitting 
member of staff at the King Edward VII Hospital in London, where the 
Duchess of Cambridge was being treated for acute morning sickness, to 
take the call made by two Australian DJs pretending to be the Queen and 
Prince Charles.

She passed them on to a second nurse on Kate's ward, who was then duped into giving out details of her medical condition

The results of the post-mortem 
examination are not yet known, and an inquest is due to be opened and adjourned tomorrow.

Family spokesman, Labour MP Keith Vaz, said yesterday Mrs 
Saldanha's family were demanding answers from the hospital about the 
circumstances that led to her death.

Although bosses at the hospital in 
Marylebone have said they will conduct internal inquiries, the nurse's 
family – husband Ben Barboza, 49, and children Junal, 17, and Lisha, 14 –
 'want to know everything'.

Mr Vaz, who has met hospital chairman 
Lord Glenarthur to demand a full inquiry, said: 'What the chairman of 
the hospital said to me was that there are inquiries going on in the 
hospital.

The family of Jacintha Saldanha is to receive more than £300,000 from a memorial fund.

The nurse's husband and teenage children will be donated money generated from the advertising profits of Sydney station 2Day FM, whose presenters were behind the prank call.

In way of reparations, Southern Cross Austereo (SCA), the parent company of 2Day FM, said it would establish a memorial fund to benefit the nurse's family.

The company said a minimum contribution of around £320,000 would be made.

Rhys Holleran, SCA's chief executive, said: 'We are very sorry for what has happened. It is a terrible tragedy and our thoughts continue to be with the family.

'We hope that by contributing to a memorial fund we can help to provide the Saldanha family with the support they need at this very difficult time.

'The company today reiterates that it is deeply saddened by this tragic and unforeseen event and offers its condolences to the family of Jacintha Saldanha.'

SCA has also cancelled the station's Christmas party, planned for later this week, as it would be 'inappropriate' to go ahead with the event for Sydney staff, said a spokeswoman.

'That is not sufficient for the family. There are unexplained 
circumstances. The family want to know everything. All the facts, fully 
and clearly.'

Mr Vaz added: 'The hospital needs to 
be more pro-active, a full inquiry is needed and the family need to be 
included in that.

'They are a lovely close-knit family, a Catholic family
 who will be spending their first Christmas without their mother, and 
for Ben, without his wife.'

Mr Vaz has also written to Rhys Holleran, chief executive of the radio station's owner Southern Cross Austereo, claiming that his company has yet to make any direct contact with Ms Saldanha's family.

The MP, who is chairman of the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee, conceded there had been a public apology for the incident and its consequences through the media.

But he wrote: ‘I am concerned and disappointed that Southern Cross Austereo appears to have not taken any steps to assist the family.

‘There has been no written apology, no request for a meeting with the family and no attempt to travel to the United Kingdom to express contrition.’

Mr Barboza, an NHS accountant, and his
 children live in Bristol.

Mrs Saldanha, whose body was found in the 
hospital's staff accommodation she used during the week, returned to the
 family home at weekends.

She had been expected home as usual 
last Friday when police broke the news of her death.

Mr Vaz said: 'They 
[the family] were in the dark about the hoax call. They hadn't watched 
the news or seen anything about it. They didn't know they were involved 
until after Jacintha's death.'

Bosses at the Australian radio 
station, 2Day FM, have also been under pressure to explain why they gave
 the go-ahead for the prank.

The company which owns the station, 
Southern Cross Austereo, yesterday cancelled its staff Christmas party 
and said it would donate the rest of the year's advertising revenue – 
some £320,000 – to a memorial fund set up in Mrs Saldanha's name by the 
hospital.

Saddened: Sydney-based 2DayFM radio presenters Michael Christian (left) and Mel Greig (right in left, and right) made a grovelling apology in two interviews aired on Australian TV yesterday (one seen right)

Chief executive Rhys Holleran said: 
'We hope ... we can help to provide the Saldanha family with the 
support they need at this very difficult time.'

The hospital said it would 'welcome' the gesture.

Prime Minister David Cameron yesterday described Mrs Saldanha's death as 'an absolute tragedy'.

He said: 'I feel incredibly sorry for 
her and her family. It is an absolute tragedy that this has happened and
 I am sure everyone will want to reflect on how it was allowed to 
happen.'

A St James's Palace spokesman stressed
 it did not complain about the hoax call, saying: 'On the contrary, we 
offered our full and heartfelt support to the nurses and hospital 
staff.'

Damaging scandal: Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross left obscene messages for Andrew Sachs

The risks involved in prank phone calls were made alarmingly clear in the UK following the BBC ‘Sachsgate’ row in 2008.

Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross left obscene messages on the answering machine of actor Andrew Sachs, giving details of Brand’s sexual relationship with Mr Sachs’s granddaughter.

The call had damaging and long-lasting effects – according to Mr Sachs, it destroyed his relationship with his granddaughter. 

But just like last week’s royal hoax, the ordeal could have been prevented.

In both cases the calls were pre-recorded and their broadcast was allowed by senior management. Brand and Radio 2 controller Lesley Douglas resigned from the BBC and Ross was suspended without pay for 12 weeks.
