Indigenous people armed with bows and arrows have clashed with mounted police armed with tear gas, helmets and riot shields - just weeks before the World Cup begins.

Protestors wearing traditional tribal dress squared up to police in Brazil's capital, Brasilia - and one officer ended up being shot in the leg with an arrow.

The violent scenes unfolded next to the Mane Garrincha National Stadium, amid a climate of increasing civil disobedience by groups looking to disrupt the event saying it will cost too much for a developing nation.

Stand off: Mounted police, armed with tear gas and riot helmets, confront native Brazilians, brandishing bows and arrows, to stop them from marching towards the Mane Garrincha stadium during a demonstration in Brasilia

Boiling point: Native Brazilians stand their ground carrying sharp sticks and bows and arrows and wearing their headdresses, as police, carrying batons and wearing protective outfits ride their horses towards the protesters

Taking aim: An Indigenous protester in traditional headdress sits on the grass and leans back as he gets ready to fire an arrow at the military police forming a line in the distance. One officer was shot in the leg during the violent clash

Hitting back: Military police ise riot shields as they advance on the demonstrators outside the national stadium while the officer on the far left unleashes a tear gas canister as demonstrations turn violent

In clashes broadcast live on television, riot police fired tear gas into small pockets of protesters as they approached Brasilia's new stadium that will host Cup matches.

Protesters were seen picking up the gas canisters and throwing them back at officers, along with stones and pieces of wood.

Some of the demonstrators were armed with bows and arrows, and fired a few arrows at mounted police, one of which hit an officer in the leg. Authorities said surgery was required to remove it.

Activist groups told the newspaper Globo 
that at least two indigenous people were also injured, though it was not
 clear how it happened or the status of their condition.

Brazil's indigenous communities are calling for the federal court to demarcate indigenous lands - but they were also protesting against the 2014 FIFA World Cup amid wider concerns about the cost of staging the tournament

The clashes, which drew about 300 demonstrators, ended by nightfall.

But the violence forced officials to call off a ceremony just outside Brasilia's stadium where the World Cup trophy was to be exhibited.

Indigenous activists were there to complain about legislation before congress that threatens to shrink the size of some reserves for indigenous groups.

They were joined by demonstrators rallying against Brazil's hosting of the World Cup. Many Brazilians are angered about the billions being spent on the tournament, saying the money should have gone to improving Brazil's woeful public services.

Brazil has seen almost daily protests in the weeks leading up to the World Cup, which begins on June 12.

Indians have routinely protested in Brasilia against efforts to change the rules around how Indian reservations boundaries are determined. They invaded Congress while it was in session on several occasions last year

Last year, huge anti-government protests took over streets in dozens of cities during the Confederations Cup, which is international football's warm-up tournament for its premier event, the World Cup.

Recent protests have been far smaller than those seen last year, when a total of a million people took to the streets across Brazil on a single night.

Elsewhere in Brazil yesterday, about 500 teachers peacefully rallied on a main avenue in Sao Paulo, South America's largest city. They have been on strike for about a month, demanding higher salaries.

Brasilia's stadium will cost 1.9 
billion reais (£500million) when the surrounding landscaping is 
finished after the World Cup, city auditors said in a report published 
last week, almost three times the price tag first budgeted.

Though
 they have not previously joined anti-World Cup protests, Indians have 
routinely protested in Brasilia against efforts to change the rules 
around how Indian reservations boundaries are determined. They invaded 
Congress while it was in session on several occasions last year.

Brazil's
 President Dilma Rousseff has promised the Homeless Worker's movement 
that squatters who have gathered around some of the stadiums will 
receive low-cost government housing.

But her government has warned that 
it will call in troops if necessary to prevent protests disrupting the 
soccer games.

Some 600,000 foreign football fans are expected to travel to Brazil for the World Cup.

Indigenous people were not the only ones demonstrating yesterday. Here a woman shouts out at a bus station in Brasilia in front of a banner reading: 'FIFA go home'. They were protesting against the billions spent so far on staging the upcoming tournament

The protests came as it was revealed that Brasilia's stadium will cost 1.9billion reais (£500million) when the surrounding landscaping is finished after the World Cup, almost three times the price tag first budgeted
