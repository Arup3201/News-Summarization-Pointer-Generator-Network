A month after insisting it remained 'some distance' from being able to stage the Open in Northern Ireland for the first time since 1951, the R&A is set to announce Royal Portrush will host the championship in 2019.

Rumours of the Open returning to Portrush have been circulating for some time, with reports on May 11 claiming a deal had been done for 2019, 68 years after Max Faulkner won the only Open staged outside England and Scotland.

The R&A's initial response on Twitter labelled such reports as 'Portrush rumours' and a statement issued later read: 'As part of our commitment to examine the feasibility of staging an Open Championship at Portrush, The R&A continues to discuss this at a conceptual level with Royal Portrush Golf Club and the Northern Ireland Executive.

'Discussions have been positive but we are still some distance from being in a position to take The Open to Northern Ireland.'

However, it is understood an announcement is expected to be made shortly, possibly on Monday to coincide with the first day of the Amateur Championship which is being staged at Portrush and Portstewart.

The R&A denied reports last summer that the Open was set to be held at Portrush in 2018. R&A chief executive Peter Dawson admitted that it is 'a fantastic golf course', but concerns remained over the infrastructure required to stage a major and Dawson feels the current nine-course Open rota is 'about right.'

Portrush has not hosted a major championship since the 1951 Open, but the Irish Open drew massive crowds there in 2012 and the likes of major champions Rory McIlroy, Darren Clarke and Graeme McDowell have been lobbying on Portrush's behalf.

It has also been suggested that the R&A would hasten their decision after Portrush emerged as a surprise contender to stage the US PGA Championship.

The PGA of America is studying the impact of holding the event outside the United States, with the earliest possible date in 2020. It had been thought that Asia would be the most likely venue, but PGA of America president Ted Bishop said in November last year that he was interested in Portrush.

Portrush native McDowell, whose brother works at the club, said at the time: 'It's always been a dream of mine to play the Open there but the US PGA would do nicely.

'It's very bizarre and an amazing statement. I couldn't believe it and read it three times. I had heard the US PGA was looking at going global, which is a very positive step forward, but I was expecting Asia, not the north coast of Ireland.

'Even if it never comes to fruition it's a great boost to be mentioned in that breath. My brother Gary is on the greenkeeping staff there and he will have a spring in his step.'
