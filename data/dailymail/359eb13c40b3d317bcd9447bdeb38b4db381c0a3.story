Plans for a large, Muslim-only cemetery to be built on a plot of rural land have upset residents, who have publicly objected to the new development.

People from Catherine-de-Barnes, near Solihull in the West Midlands, have objected to the 'major development', which will include space for 4,000 followers of Islam to be buried, and 75 parking spaces for visitors.

As the latest census figures give the village's population as just 613, this means the cemetery could eventually hold six-and-a-half times as many people as Catherine-de-Barnes itself.

Rural: Residents of Catherine-de-Barnes, in the West Midlands, have objected to a proposed Muslim-only cemetery

Objections: Letters submitted to the council say that the plans come too soon after other developments

In the rural settlements of Solihull, the most predominant ethnic group is White, with all settlements - apart from Dickens Heath and Catherine-de-Barnes - having a White population of between 97 per cent and 99 per cent.

Census data from 2001 reveals that of the 11,654 population of the Bickenhill ward (of which Catherine-de-Barnes is part), 37 people registered their religion as Muslim.

In mid-2009, it was estimated that there were 21,500 Black or Asian Ethnic Minority (BAME) residents in Solihull, equating to 10.5 per cent of the borough’s population compared with 12.5 per cent in England and 14.4 per cent of the West Midlands.

By 2013, there were significantly more Muslims (+3,610, 221 per cent) than in 2001.

The majority of Solihull residents describe themselves as Christian (65.6 per cent), with no religion the second largest group (21.4 per cent).

The Asian population represents the largest proportion of BAME groups in the rural areas of Solihull, with the exception of Catherine-de-Barnes, where 'other' ethnic groups make up the greatest proportion of BME groups.

The cemetery would be able to comply 
fully with Sharia law - which stipulates a method of bathing and 
shrouding the bodies of Muslims, before they are buried with their heads
 facing towards Mecca.

Solihull Council has received several letters of complaint about the plans, which were proposed by Mohammed Moosa.

The objections focus on the size of the cemetery, and the decision to place the patch on fertile land in the green belt.

One letter, from villager Karen Guest, 51, said: 'We are amazed at yet another planning application on this beautiful arable land following the recent dogs' home planning approval.

'If further applications are approved then sooner rather than later the whole acreage will be built up.'

Another, from Pam Gibbins, said: 'I must protest vigorously. We are not talking about a small parochial cemetery, but a major development that will impact on the traffic system.'

Letters have also been received in support of the venture. One, signed by five supporters, said: 'I agree that a Muslim cemetery would be preferred and beneficial for the Muslim residents in the borough of Solihull.

'I would like to confirm the need for a private Muslim burial ground, which adheres to all Islamic bereavement values and laws.'

Slow down: One council member said the cemetery was not 'an appropriate development in greenbelt land'

A planning statement from Cemetery Development Services said: 'Few burial authorities are able to facilitate full Muslim burials in accordance with the practice of Sharia Law.'

Bob Sleigh, a member of the town council, said there is sufficient space already available at the borough's two main cemeteries.

He said: 'The issue here is whether there is an over-riding need and I don't believe there is.'

'I do not believe this is an appropriate development in greenbelt land. Residents who have spoken to me, including the parish council and residents association, have concerns about the design and vehicles access.

'The access road is a dangerous road and residents have concerns over the increase in traffic this development will cause.'

Dr Issam Ghannam, a Solihull Imam, said: 'We have a growing Muslim population in Solihull. We have also an ageing population and plots are filling up.

'The nearest Muslim cemetery is Handsworth and it can be extremely difficult for relatives to visit their loved ones.'
