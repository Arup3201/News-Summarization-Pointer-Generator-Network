Ed Miliband will not win the next election if he continues to lurch to the left, Labour former spin doctor Peter Mandelson has warned.

In a challenge to the Labour leader, the former business secretary, who was one of the founders of New Labour, said that those who believe the country has moved to the left following the financial crisis are wrong.

‘Those who don't give their political loyalty automatically to left or right – whose votes, therefore, are up for grabs – are a greater segment of the electorate now than they were when New Labour was being created in the 1990s,’ he said.

Lord Mandelson: The former Trade and Industry Secretary believes that Labour must retreat to the centre ground

‘Therefore, it is even more important now to win the centre ground to win electoral victory.’

Lord Mandelson made the comments in an interview with Progress magazine to celebrate 20 years since Tony Blair became leader, but it is clear he wants Mr Miliband to learn lessons from his electoral success.

He said: ‘It is essential still to win on leadership and the economy, and to demonstrate that we are a party of conscience and reform that will talk to people's values and concerns, not simply keep driving an agenda of our own regardless of the electorate's views.

‘That is why I get frustrated sometimes when people argue now that the country has moved to the left, therefore if we are more unambiguously left-wing and raise our ideological vigour, we are more likely to win the next election.’ 

The Labour peer argued the party needs to heed the lesson of defeat in 1992 under Neil Kinnock.

He said: ‘The truth was, however fed up people were with the Tories, they were not going to switch to Labour in sufficient numbers unless they were absolutely sure of what we were going to do in government.

'All right!' Neil Kinnock at the start of the ill-fated 1992 General Election campaign when people did not trust Labour despite being fed up with the Tories after 13 years in power; present Labour leader Ed Miliband who Peter Mandelson thinks is taking the party far too far to the left to win the next General Election

‘We had to demonstrate that we really could manage people's money and steer an economic course that would deliver sustainable economic growth and jobs.’ 

Lord Mandelson said that Mr Blair’s opponents in the party had to wait for the Iraq invasion before they could remove him.

‘It gave them a stick to beat Blair with, knowing they were going to get media support, the right-wing media because he was Labour, and the left-wing media because he was New Labour. They hated his electoral success and Iraq was the opportunity to dislodge him,’ he said.

Tony Blair is due to give a speech on 21 July to mark 20 years since he became Labour leader.
