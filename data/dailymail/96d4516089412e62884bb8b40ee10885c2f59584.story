Paedophile: Michael Jackson held the child prisoner for three hours and sexually assaulting him after being dragged into his flat

A ‘predatory paedophile’ who changed 
his name to Michael Jackson has been jailed indefinitely for snatching a
 ten-year-old boy off the street in broad daylight.

The sex attacker – who took the name 
of the late singer to impress a former wife – was branded the ‘stuff of 
every parent’s nightmare’ by the judge who sentenced him yesterday.

Jackson, 50, marched the victim to 
his housing association flat and threatened him at knifepoint, telling 
him, ‘Scream and I’ll kill you’, before pushing him into an airing 
cupboard, trussed up and naked from the waist down.

During a three-and-a-half hour ordeal
 the boy was sexually assaulted and told that if he cried out his father
 would be murdered and he would never see his mother again.

Jackson then left the flat to build 
up an alibi by visiting friends, shutting the child in the cupboard to 
be further abused at his ‘leisure’.

Wolverhampton Crown Court heard the 
victim had been popping to a corner shop for his mother when Jackson 
pounced in Oldbury, West Midlands, last November.

Jackson, who was known to the 
authorities after committing similar offences in the 1980s, had 
attempted to snatch the same boy four days earlier, chasing him to his 
front door.

The boy’s mother said in a victim 
impact statement that the incidents had turned the family’s life ‘upside
 down’, with the boy now too scared to venture out without his dog to 
protect him.

Judge Martin Walsh yesterday warned 
the former pirate radio DJ he may never be released and ordered him to 
serve a minimum of seven years before becoming eligible to apply for 
parole.

He said: ‘It is simply impossible to imagine the sheer terror experienced by that young child as a result of your actions.

‘I’m satisfied that had he not escaped, this young boy would have been subjected to serious sexual assaults or worse.’

No emotion: Jackson grabbed the 10-year-old boy when he went on a trip to local shops in November, 2011

The judge warned it was likely to be ‘very many years, if ever’ before Jackson would be judged fit for release.

Debi Gould, prosecuting, said: ‘Nobody can imagine the terror  of such an experience for such a little boy.’

The child was freed after shuffling to a window when Jackson left and shouting to a family friend who was out searching for him.

After Jackson was arrested, a 
ten-year-old girl came forward to reveal how she had been abducted, tied
 up and photographed by Jackson two months earlier, before he 
‘mercifully’ released her.

Jackson moved to the flat where the 
crime took place – in a block run by a housing association which works 
to help resettle ex-offenders – in 2008 to be closer to his family.

The paedophile, born Albert English, 
has amassed 20 convictions for 73 offences dating back to 1976, 
including two similar sexual assaults from the early 1980s.

He was jailed for 30 months after he 
dragged a 13-year-old girl out of a lift at knifepoint in 1983 and took 
her to his tower block flat at Smethwick, three miles from Oldbury.

After tying her up with her own laces
 he molested her during a seven-hour ordeal. She said he only let her 
leave the property alive after she promised to be his girlfriend. That 
victim lives just streets away from the boy he attacked last November.

Jackson, who has at least one 
grown-up child, admitted kidnap, sexual assault, false imprisonment and 
kidnap with intent to commit a sexual offence in relation to the boy’s 
disappearance.

He also admitted the abduction of the ten-year-old girl and was ordered to sign the Sex Offenders’ Register.
