A waitress in a Chinese restaurant stunned diners  by picking up a dead cockroach and eating it in front of them.

Jin Kuo, 39, got into a heated row with businessman Zhang Yen, 43,  when he complained about finding the insect in a plate of salad.

Jin said it was 'perfectly normal' to find an cockroach in a restaurant and then, to prove her point, she swallowed it.

The bizarre incident happened atthe Jinsha Era Plaza hotel restaurant in Chengdu, the capital of central China's Sichuan province.

One of the people who was with Zhang as a guest  grabbed his mobile phone and started to video the incident.

The waitress was heard saying: 'No matter which restaurant you go to, you will always find cockroaches in the food. It is very normal.'

Enraged at her attitude, Zhang told her that if it was so normal, she should eat it to solve the problem, and then there would not need to any need to argue.

But to his amazement, that was exactly what the waitress did, picking the cockroach off the side of the plate and putting it into her mouth before swallowing it.

Jin  grabbed it and ate it to prove that it was perfectly harmless, leaving businessman Zhang Yen, 43, stunned

The restaurant owner has apologised for the incident and saidÂ the waitress had been punished

Shocked Zhang was left speechless by what she had done, and had nothing more to say. Instead he opened up his wallet, paid the bill, and left, still shaking his head in amazement.

The restaurant owner meanwhile has apologised over the incident and said that the cockroach had probably crawled into the dish from outside while cooking.

She added that the waitress had been punished for not accepting the fault, and had been told she was going to get a pay cut for the foreseeable future to teach her lesson.

Commentators however who viewed the video on social media sites said the waitress should have been given a pay rise.

It is not the first time a staff member has tried to defuse a hygiene row by eating the evidence.

In May, a restaurant manager ate a condom after customers found it in their fish dish.

He had rejected their claim it was a condom and insisted it was a ring of calamari and ate it to prove the point.
