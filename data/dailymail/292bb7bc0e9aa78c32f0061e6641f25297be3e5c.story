A filmmaker has created a nailbiting video of a group of daredevils attempting to tightrope walk between two hot-air balloons.

Filmmaker Sébastien Montaz-Rosset shot the exploits of a group of French adventurers who call themselves Skyliners as they attempted the death-defying feat.

The group strung up a line between two hot-air balloons then launched them high into the skies before attempting to walk across the tightrope.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Motley crew: The Skyliners prepare for their latest adventure

Lift-off: The two balloons, joined by a tightrope, begin to rise

Basket case: The French daredevils take the balloons higher and higher

None of the walkers managed to make it all the way across the line before falling.

Many were wearing small cameras on their heads to capture first-person footage of the exhilarating stunt.

None of the footage shows the tightrope walkers drifting to the ground on parachutes, but presumably that's what the tiny packs on their backs contain.

Three's a crowd: A third balloon of observers watches the two joined ones

High rise: The first tightroper edges out into the open air

Fine line: The rope looks slack and the walker has difficulty keeping his balance as he is buffeted by the wind

Skyliners describe themselves as 'a group of flying Frenchies,' whose passions are 'highlining, basejumping, mountaineering and much more.'Montaz-Rosset, whose childhood in the French Alps fueled his passion for the outdoors and sports, has been following and filming the group for several years and recently released a film about them.Entitled, I Believe I Can Fly (Flight of the Frenchies) is about Skyliners Tancrède and Julien who pioneered 'highlining,' a vertiginous combination of climbing, slackline and tightrope walking.

The fall: The walker loses his balance, holding the rope briefly before falling to the ground

Vertigo: A camera on this walker's head shows exactly what he can see

Wobbly: It's incredible the Skyliners can take any steps at all

Free falling: The walker loses his balance and falls to the cheers of his team

While none of the Skyliners were successful in their first hot-air balloon tightroping bid, the crew intend to make another attempt within days.THe hot-air balloon is the oldest successful human-carrying flight technology. The very first untethered balloon was launched from Paris in 1783 by Jean-François Pilâtre de Rozier and François Laurent d'Arlandes.
