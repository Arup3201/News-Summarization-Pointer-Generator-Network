A pre-season match between Maccabi Haifa and Bundesliga team Paderborn has been cancelled after pro-Palestinian demonstrators stormed the pitch during the Israeli club’s previous game in Austria.

Wilfried Ellinger, the deputy mayor of Kirchbichl, tells the Austria Press Agency on Friday that the match was called off because his small town wouldn’t be able to guarantee security.

Maccabi and Paderborn had been scheduled to play Saturday.

Tension: Pro-Palestinian supporters attacked the Maccabi Haifa players

On Wednesday, about 20 protesters 
waving Palestinian flags and signs with anti-Israeli slogans ran onto 
the pitch during Maccabi’s friendly against French side Lille in 
Bischofshofen, near Salzburg. Players and protesters clashed, and the 
game was abandoned.

Supporters
 of reportedly Turkish origin ran onto the field in the Austrian stadium
 where the game was played and headed for the Maccabi players, sparking 
ugly scenes.

One of the 
players was seen to trip a fan before punches were thrown. The Maccabi 
players - some of whom retaliated - managed to leave the field unhurt.

Maccabi Haifa denounced the attack, saying the club 'believes in co-existence, tolerance and is against violence'.
