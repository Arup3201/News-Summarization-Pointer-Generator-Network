Yaya Toure's agent has claimed the Manchester City midfielder would have won one of football’s leading individual awards by now if he was white.

Following two attacks on City from his client this summer,  Dimitri Seluk also refused to guarantee that Toure will still be a City player next season amid interest from Paris Saint-Germain.

Claim: Yaya Toure claimed he was not being appreciated at City after the club did not wish him a happy birthday

Seluk expressed his bemusement at how 
Toure could finish only third in the voting for the PFA and FWA 
Footballer of the Year awards last season after scoring 20 goals in 35 
matches to inspire City to the title.

Seluk
 said: ‘If he (Toure) was white, 100 per cent he would have won one of 
these top awards. I don’t want to talk too much about racism or the 
politics of football, but he does not get the praise he should get. Yaya
 has three times in a row won the African Player of the Year, but it is 
different with the other awards.’

Toure
 claimed in April that he did not get the recognition that he deserved 
because he is African and during the World Cup said that no one cared 
when his nation, Ivory Coast, exited because they are African.

Toure
 also hit the headlines in May when he criticised his club for not 
making a fuss over his birthday, and also claimed City refused a request
 for compassionate leave to visit his dying brother before he left for 
the World Cup — an accusation denied by the club.

Toure’s
 critics have accused the midfielder of trying to engineer a move away 
and Seluk admitted that an offer from a big European club could make a 
difference.

‘I will see Yaya
 for a couple of days before he goes to America (for a pre-season tour) 
when we will talk about things,’ Seluk told The Times. ‘If an important 
club like PSG or Real Madrid made a big offer it would be for Manchester
 City to decide what happens.’
