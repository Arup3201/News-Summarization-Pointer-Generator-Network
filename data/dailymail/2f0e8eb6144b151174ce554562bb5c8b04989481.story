A plumber has said he has been left unable to eat anything after he discovered a dead mouse inside a bag of frozen scampi.

Mohammed Ali, 37, says all he has consumed is fruit juice after finding the dead rodent inside the packet of seafood from Tesco.

He poured the contents into a deep fat fryer for an afternoon snack, but then a couple of minutes later he noticed something black in the hot oil.

Floored: Mohammed Ali, a plumber from Stoneyburn, West Lothian, saw it as he sat down for his dinner

Mr Ali, from Stoneyburn, West Lothian, said he is still too sick to eat after finding the rodent on Wednesday and can only drink juice.

'I stuck my hand in the bag and and put it in - I was in a hurry,' he said. Two minutes later, he added: 'I saw something black was inside it.

'I thought "what the hell is that?" I fished it out and it was a mouse. I was shocked.

'I was upset and angry. I was looking forward to scampi and I love scampi.'

The plumber has since been teased by his family. He said: 'I went to my brother’s party later that day and as soon as I got in my brother was going, ‘Squeak! Squeak!’”'

Mr Ali bought the £3 pack of breaded fish from Tesco in Bathgate, West Lothian, on Wednesday.

After making the gruesome find he contacted Tesco and West Lothian Council, who are both investigating. Trading standards officers visited him yesterday.

A council spokesman said: 'We have been contacted by a local resident regarding the alleged find of a mouse in a locally bought food product.'

A Tesco spokesman added: 'We set ourselves very high standards for the safety and quality of our food.

'The product has not been returned to store by Mr Ali but we will be assisting the local authority with any investigation they may undertake.'

If the probe supports Mr Ali's allegations, he will not have been the first to find a rodent in his food.

In 2010 Stephen Forse, from Kidlington, Oxfordshire, was horrified to find a mouse baked into a Hovis Best of Both loaf which he had bought from Tesco.

He made the gruesome discovery as he was preparing sandwiches for his children.

The find led to producers Premier Foods being fined £5,500 and ordered to pay costs of more than £11,000.
