An obese bride-to-be who waited 12 years to marry her fiance because she feared she would look fat in her wedding photos lost nine stone to wear her dream white gown... and it was the first time she had ever worn a dress.

Jane Bailey, 38, from Staffordshire, survived on a diet of chocolate and pastry, weighed 20st 9lb, and was known as 'The Big One' and 'Big Jane' among her work colleagues.

With a waistline of 46in she had never been confident enough to wear a dress.

Jane and fiance Andy, 48, got engaged 12 years ago, but never organised anything until January 2011 when Jane was browsing for wedding dresses and fell in love with one.

She determined to lose enough weight to fit into it on her big day, and the mother-of-three immediately joined her 
local Slimming World group.

Incredibly,
she managed to lose nine stone over the next two years, dropped from
a hefty size 26 to a svelte size 12 on a diet of healthy eating.

And
on June 14 Jane slipped into the stunning empire-line dress with 
flowing skirt to walk down the aisle and finally tie the knot with Andy 
after a decade of waiting.

It
was the first dress she had ever worn, having spent years covering up in loose-fitting T-shirts and 
jeans.

Jane, who now weighs a healthy 11st 9lb, said: 'I had been engaged to Andy for 12 years, but I kept putting off setting a date because I didn’t want to look big on my wedding day.

'I used to eat things like chocolate and custard tarts in secret.

'People referred to me as the Big One or Big Jane and although I was only really teased as a teenager I knew I had to lose weight, especially for my wedding.

'I joined Slimming World in January 2011, I lost about six stone in the first year and three months ago I finally got married.

'I felt amazing on my wedding day and it was great that I could fit into my dream dress.

'It wanted this particular type of dress but I was never going to be able to wear something like that the size I was.'

Jane said: 'I have the confidence and the figure to wear more dresses and it feels amazing to be able to do so'

'Getting in to your typical tight wedding dress was what my ultimate goal was. That really my main focus.

'I never wore dresses as I was quite tomboyish when I was large - I just lived in jeans and T-shirts all the time.

'It was amazing really - I worked really hard and the first dress I was ever able to wear turned out to be my wedding dress.'

Jane said she was also forced into action when she got a new job as an IT trainer at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire.

And she says losing the weight has since brought out her inner girl and means she enjoys clothes shopping for the first time.

Jane, from Kidsgrove, Staffordshire, added: 'The wedding was the key one that kept me going but there was also my job, which I had only been doing for six months.

'It was a job where I was very mobile rather than sat at a desk and I found it difficult to be on my feet all day.

'I was standing up in front of people training them and it made me very body conscious - especially in front of doctors and nurses. I felt as if they were judging me.

'People who have known me forever said the wedding has brought out my inner girl.

'Now I enjoy buying clothes and getting my hair done but before when I was big I would never buy anything that would be feminine.

'I have the confidence and the figure to wear more dresses and it feels amazing to be able to do so.'

Husband Andy, who owns a hardware store, added: 'She looked beautiful walking down the aisle - she looked a completely different woman.

'She has worked so hard and I am very proud of her.'

Jane will now take part in the national ‘Slimmer of the Year’ finals in Birmingham tomorrow.
