A diving-mad couple have taken the plunge - and tied the knot 30ft underwater.

With the bride in her wedding dress and groom in his suit, the adventurous American couple swam down the aisle, before saying 'I do'.

Bill Frenier, 52, and Lizbeth Espejo Frenier, 32, decided to hold their wedding in the Atlantic Ocean, just off the coast of Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

One wet wedding! Bill Frenier and Lizbeth Espejo Frenier tied the knot deep in the Atlantic Ocean, just off the coast of Fort Lauderdale, Florida

The undersea ceremony was conducted by a scuba-clad justice of the peace and the couple exchanged both rings and vows in the presence of their friends and family.

The wedding congregation even included a couple of curious sharks. 

Lizbeth, a funeral director, said: 'Our "real" wedding was in Las Vegas this past November, but many of our friends couldn't attend since it was really far.

You may kiss the bride! The ceremony was conducted by a scuba-clad Justice of the Peace and the couple exchanged both rings and vows in the presence of their friends and family - and a few curious sharks who swam past

Deep love: The couple  had a "real" wedding  in Las Vegas this past November, but many of their friends couldn't attend since it was really far for them to travel so they held one under the sea as well

Guests: Scuba-clad guests swam from the shore to the site of the ceremony to watch the diving fans tie the knot

'So, since Bill and I are avid divers, and most of our friends are too, we thought it would be a great idea to do it all again underwater.'

The wedding was a shore dive, which meant most of the guests swam from the shore to the site of the ceremony.

The service was attended by twenty guests and most were able to watch the ceremony fully submerged, with the aid of oxygen masks, goggles, and scuba gear underneath their regular outfits.

The less experienced divers had the option to snorkel and watch from the surface.

Quick dip: The ceremony lasted around 15 minutes and the guests then hit the beach for a celebratory BBQ

William and Lizbeth's nuptials lasted 15 minutes before the happy couple enjoyed a beach BBQ with their loved ones.

Meeting by chance in Las Vegas in 2008, Lizbeth moved from her home state of California to live with Bill in Florida, where she quickly adopted his love of diving.

'Bill has dived for over twenty years,' said Lizbeth.

'He had a great idea that I sign up for a dive class with him accompanying me for support.'

Still in tact: Lizbeth simply soaked her wedding dress in laundry soap, which, she says, cleaned up the seawater smell completely

The couple were forced to cancel the original date of their underwater wedding due to choppy seas.

This June, however, the weather was on their side and the sea remained still.

Lizbeth said: 'All of the family and friends were super excited when I told them about the idea for the wedding, most thought it was such a unique concept and a great idea.

'I thought I would have to throw my wedding gown away after the dive. Miraculously, it's not in bad shape.

'Soaking it in laundry soap cleaned up the seawater smell completely!

'But, unfortunately, Bill's suit is now ruined.'
