Arizona Cardinals defensive end Darnell Dockett is out for the season with a knee injury, so perhaps it's unsurprising that he's spending a lot more of his time stirring up drama on Twitter.  

On Monday, the 33-year-old posted an unintentionally provocative picture of Malia Obama which he somehow eclipsed today by live-tweeting his experience serving jury duty. 

The picture of the 16-year-old first daughter has been making the rounds online, and is a screen grab of a televised event that focuses on her back side.

Arizona Cardinals defensive end Darnell Dockett has been causing controversy on social media with a two controversial posts this week 

On Monday, Dockett reposted this picture of 16-year-old first daughter Malia Obama on Instagram. The photo has been making the rounds online the past day or so, but Dockett chose to repost a picture uploaded by an Instagram user who captioned the photo 'When her prom?' 

An Instagram used with the username 'dreday_4' reposted the image to his feed on Monday with the caption 'When her prom?'. 

Dockett apparently found the picture funny since he commented 'Omgggg' and reposted it on his own profile, adding 'lmfaooo' to the caption. It appears both have since deleted the picture of Malia, a minor, from their profiles. 

But if Dockett felt any shame in posting the controversial picture of the eldest first daughter, he didn't show it on Tuesday when he started tweeting bright and early from inside court where he was serving on a jury. 

And like most people called in to perform their civic duty, Dockett wasn't too happy to be there, and continued to tweet even after a  bailiff asked all of the jurors to hand over their phones. 

'Damn I got jury duty today!!! F***! I'm not the one for this,' he wrote. 

Dockett went on to express his distrust for the American justice department, writing the the system is flawed and because 'people who doing jury duty with me has already made there mind up on this guy...so do I really matter?' 

He then dispenses from legal advice, while also revealing a detail of the case. According to his tweets, the person on trial may have talked to investigators without a lawyer. 

On Tuesday, Dockett went on to live-tweet from court where he was serving jury duty. Pictured above in a silly shot posted to his Instagram account recently 

'I wish this guy would have told me what his intentions was, I could have helped him plan this out better to get away with it! #badplan'

'Rule #1 don't talk with out a lawyer!!!! #2 all cases can be beat!!! #3 call Dockett to help plan!! #4 keep don't talk with out a Lawyer!!' 

At one point during his day on jury, Dockett goes on a tangent about the police officer watching over his group and about how he's not intimidated by the man. 

'They bring this big a** police in here like he supposed to scare me while I'm looking like I don't give a s***. I'm like you wand [coffee] and [donuts].' 

Dockett gives even more annoyed when the police officer tells him he can't elave to get food. 

'I just told this guy I'm hungry and he's like I can't leave.. wtf U mean I can't eat! Ok watch this. Im gonna order pizza off this app! F.U.!' 

He also boasts about double-parking his $450,000 car in a handicap spot, which he gained access to with a sticker from a recent surgery, and the registered pistol inside. 

While he tweets several times about possibly getting kicked out of court, he continued to tweet into Tuesday evening. 

He even appears to have come around to see the legal process as at least entertaining. 

'I need to be a lawyer...this is crazy!!!' one of his more recent tweets reads. 

This isn't the first time Dockett has made controversial remarks on Twitter. 

Last year, he refused to apology for a racially-insensitive tweet about Asians, in which he wrote: 'Apple has a new device out for Chinese people. The iOpener'. 

Before joining the Arizona Cardinals in the 2004 draft,  Dockett played college football at Florida State University.
