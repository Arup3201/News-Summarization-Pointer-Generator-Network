Russian hackers have stolen 1.2 billion user names and passwords in a series of Internet heists affecting 420,000 websites, according to a report published Tuesday.

The thievery was uncovered by Hold Security, a Milwaukee firm that specializes in exposing security breaches.

The identities of the websites that were broken into haven't been revealed yet.

Concerns: Besides filching 1.2 billion online passwords, the hackers also have amassed 500 million email addresses that could help them engineer other crimes

The breaches were reported by The New York Times, which said nondisclosure agreements required Hold Security to keep some information confidential. 

The reported break-ins are the latest incidents to raise doubts about the security measures that both big and small companies use to protect people's information online.

Security experts believe hackers will continue breaking into computer networks unless companies become more vigilant.

'Companies that rely on usernames and passwords have to develop a sense of urgency about changing this,' Avivah Litan, a security analyst at the research firm Gartner told the Times.

Retailer Target Corp. is still struggling to win back its shoppers' trust after hackers believed to be attacking from Eastern Europe stole 40 million credit card numbers and 70 million addresses, phone numbers and other personal information last winter.

Alex Holden, the founder and chief information security officer of Hold Security, told the Times that most of the sites hit by the Russian hackers are still vulnerable to further break-ins. Besides filching 1.2 billion online passwords, the hackers also have amassed 500 million email addresses that could help them engineer other crimes, according to Hold Security.

So far little of the information stolen in the wave of attacks appears to have been sold to other online crooks, according to the Times. Instead, the information is being used to send marketing pitches, schemes and other junk messages on social networks on Twitter, the newspaper said.

The breadth of these break-ins should serve as a chilling reminder of the skullduggery that has been going undetected on the Internet for years, said John Prisco, CEO of another security firm, Triumfant.

'This issue reminds me of an iceberg, where 90 percent of it is actually underwater,' Prisco said in an emailed statement. 'That's what is going on here... So many cyber breaches today are not actually reported, often times because companies are losing information and they are not even aware of it.'

Candid Wueest, Principal Threat Researcher from Symantec Security Response, said that despite the huge volume of data stolen by the Russians, there's no cause for panic.

He told MailOnline: 'There's no need to run around and panic. It's not the first or last data breach - just a very large one. Plus, there's still speculation about just how old this data is.'

Mr Wueest explained that using robust passwords is the key to keeping personal details safe from intruders.

He said: 'Use strong passwords, it's a no brainer. We've been teaching that for 10 to 20 years - and some people still use '12345' as a password. Having said that, it doesn't have to be really cryptic. For example, you could go for 'ireadthedailymailonceaday'. And make sure you use different passwords for every service, so that losing one password doesn't compromise too many accounts. It's fine to use the same one if it's not linked to something sensitive.

'If you can't remember your passwords, use an app like 'password manager'. This means you just need to remember one master password that unlocks all of them.'

Gary Newe, Senior Systems Engineering Manager for F5 Networks, said: 'It is worth noting that these hackers, unless they are specifically interested in a specific company for espionage, will move onto a new target if their chosen one is too difficult to compromise. So in terms of protecting yourself, you only have to make your apps more difficult to compromise than your neighbours and you will be in a better position than you are today.'

He added: 'As we have seen in the news, especially with the European Central Bank Hacking, these types of attacks and the market for this information is growing and is almost becoming legitimised in some circles.'

The news follows claims by a Berlin-based hacker that he's found a way to infiltrate communication systems on planes through Wi-Fi and inflight entertainment systems.

Ruben Santamarta, a consultant with cyber security firm IOActive, is scheduled to explain his method at this week's Black Hat hacking conference in Las Vegas.

Exposing threats: Cybersecurity researcher Ruben Santamarta says he has figured out how to hack the satellite communications equipment on passenger jets through their WiFi and inflight entertainment systems

Details are still sketchy about how the plane hack was done.

Mr Santamarta, however, has revealed that one vulnerability in equipment from all five manufacturers was the use of 'hardcoded' log-in credentials.

These are designed to let service technicians access any piece of equipment with the same login and password.

The problem is that hackers can retrieve those passwords by hacking into the firmware, then use the credentials to access sensitive systems, Mr Santamarta said.

If his claim is confirmed, it could prompt a serious review of aircraft security.

'These devices are wide open. The goal of this talk is to help change that situation,' Mr Santamarta, 32, told Reuters.

The researcher said he discovered the vulnerabilities by 'reverse engineering' - or decoding - highly specialised software known as firmware, used to operate communications equipment.

This equipment is made by companies including Cobham Plc, Harris Corp, EchoStar Corp's Hughes Network Systems, Iridium Communications Inc and Japan Radio Co Ltd.

In theory, a hacker could use a plane's onboard Wi-Fi signal or inflight entertainment system to hack into its avionics equipment, potentially disrupting or modifying satellite communications.

This could interfere with the aircraft's navigation and safety systems, Mr Santamarta said.
