A veteran Tory MP has become the first to offer to vacate his seat for Boris Johnson - opening the way for a leadership battle with David Cameron.

The move by Sir Peter Tapsell comes as UKIP soars again in the polls - reaching 17 per cent, ahead of the Lib Dems, while the Conservatives trail nine points behind Labour.

According to Tory MPs, Sir Peter, MP for Louth and Horncastle in Lincolnshire, was asked by the Prime Minister if he would stay on in the Commons until the next election.

Growing support: Ambitious Mayor of London Boris Johnson, left, is gathering greater popularity as MPs such as Sir Peter Tapsell, right, look to alternative leaders for the Conservative Party

Mr Cameron is said to have told him that the party could do without another by-election. The 83-year-old MP replied that he was ‘keeping his seat warm for Boris’.

The offer is the clearest of its kind made by a Conservative MP so far.

The MP denied he was part of a Boris ‘camp’ yesterday, but the story will add to the Prime Minister’s concerns that more and more Tory backbenchers believe the London mayor would be a better Conservative leader than him.

Mr Johnson would only be able to stand in a Tory leadership contest if he returned to the Commons - meaning an MP would have to offer to give up their seat to him. Another complication is that he has pledged to stay on as mayor until 2016.

Blond ambition: Sir Peter Tapsell said that Boris Johnson would make an excellent leader of the Conservative Party

Sir Peter, who as ‘Father of the House’ is the longest-serving MP, told the Sunday Telegraph he thought Mr Johnson would be an ‘excellent’ leader of the Opposition and ‘perhaps’ even a good prime minister.

But he added that his seat could be too far from London to be suitable for Mr Johnson. ‘The problem is my seat is a long way from the TV studios,’ said Sir Peter, who has a majority of nearly 14,000. ‘Boris would want to be closer to them.’

The offer comes as a ComRes poll showed that UKIP has surged to 17 per cent in the polls, taking support from the Tories.

Lurking danger: The UK Independence Party, led by Nigel Farage is proving an electoral threat for Conservatives

The Conservatives polled just 28 per cent, behind Labour on 37 per cent but ahead of the Lib Dems on just 9 per cent.

A separate poll by ICM found that UKIP’s policies are favoured over the Tories’ among key right-of-centre voters - particularly on immigration, government spending and same-sex marriage.

Among those who say they have yet to decide which of the two parties to vote for - around one in ten of all voters - more favour UKIP leader Nigel Farage and Mr Johnson over the Prime Minister.

In the running: Britain's first black Conservative MP Adam Afriyie has also been hotly tipped as a future party leader

Nadine Dorries, the MP for Mid-Bedfordshire who had the Tory whip suspended last year for appearing on a reality TV show, said the Tories needed a ‘change of direction’ in order to stop the flight to UKIP.

‘It seems UKIP’s march in the polls is hardening,’ she told Sky News.

‘I think there is a very stark lesson for Conservatives to be taken from this and of course it all follows on from the Eastleigh by-election.’

Yesterday Tory backbencher Adam Afriyie, who has been accused of plotting a leadership bid despite only having been elected in 2005, declined to state that he believes Mr Cameron will still be leader by the election.

Asked repeatedly on the BBC’s Sunday Politics show, he said: ‘I’m not prepared to speculate, because I think what people want to see from their politicians is they want to see leadership and a commitment to getting Britain back on top.’

Asked about his leadership ambitions, Mr Afriyie said: ‘I’m not ambitious for any position in government or any position at all in the party.

What I’m ambitious for is for the British people to get jobs, and you know, to feel proud of their country again.’
