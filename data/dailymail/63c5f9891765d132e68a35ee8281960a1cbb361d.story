A Manchester United supporters' group is planning to entice Cristiano Ronaldo back to the club by flying over a 'COME HOME RONALDO' banner during their hero's next La Liga game.

United Reel, which includes members from all over the world, has called for donations to help fund the fly-by plea, which is due to take place midway through the Real Madrid superstar's match against Villarreal at the Estadio El Madrigal on Saturday.

The group has teamed up with affiliated supporters' clubs - MUSC United Arab Emirates, MUSC Lebanon and MUSC Egypt - to show their former player 'how much the United faithful still love and support him'.

In a statement on their official Twitter account, United Reel said: '... we are all united by our love for Cristiano both as a player and as a person. We stand united in our views and will not stop until we BRING RONALDO HOME!'

The desperate group have also posted a picture of the huge banner, which they hope will attract worldwide attention with the game scheduled to be aired on Sky Sports and other major networks.

It's not the first time that United fans have turned to a flying banner after a different group paid £840 to stage a similar stunt in an effort to oust beleaguered former manager David Moyes with the message: 'WRONG ONE - MOYES OUT' in March.

Ronaldo left Old Trafford to join his boyhood club for a then world record fee of £80million in 2009. Although he has collected silverware at the Bernabeu, including the elusive tenth European Cup - La Decima - recent complaints regarding the club's transfer policy have given supporters hope.

Louis van Gaal also spoke publicly about the player, insisting he would love to sign him, though also admitting he thought Madrid wouldn't sell.

A package of around £120m would be needed to bring Ronaldo back to Old Trafford, something which may be too much for United with the prospect of Radamel Falcao signing permanently next summer.

However, the 29-year-old appeared to dismiss the notion of a return after his latest starring performance in scoring four goals during Real Madrid's 5-1 victory over Elche on Tuesday.

'They are all speculations about my future ... My future is Madrid. I'm happy this season is going well and my future, I will not speak about, it does not make sense,' he said.
