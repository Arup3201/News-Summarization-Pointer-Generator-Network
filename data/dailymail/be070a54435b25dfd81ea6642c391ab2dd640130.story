For those who have ever wondered what fireworks look like when lit from underwater - this video is for you.

In this clip, from Sweden, a man lights off a rocket under a frozen lake while a friend films nearby.

Not only did the fish get a massive shock, but the adrenaline junkies themselves were likewise pleasantly surprised by the explosive results.

A man in Sweden, Nils Bremer, experimented with a unique form of fishing - and recorded it for all to see

First of all, Nils poked several holes in the thick layer of ice at a local lake while standing on the dock

Uploaded to Youtube by Nils Bremer from Tranas, Sweden, he also stars in the video.

It begins with Nils holding up a rocket - fixed to a long wooden stick - to the camera.

Standing on a dock, he then kneels down and uses the end of a broom to crack the thick layer of ice covering the lake in several spots.

He then figured out how to carefully insert a firework - fixed to a long stick - into the icy cold water

He carefully lit the rocket and quickly dropped it into the lake, while his friend looked on and recorded

Surprisingly, the rocket took off like a shot, barrelling along the water's surface just under the icy layer

Once it reached the middle of the lake, the fireworks surfaced with a massive explosion

Nils and his friend laugh in amusement as they are showered with ice shards, courtesy of the big bang

Using a lighter, he illuminates the rocket firework and inserts it under the ice.

It quickly takes off - shooting along the water before surfacing several feet away with an impressive bang.

Thrilled with the results, the videographer - and Nils - laugh as broken ice pieces shower down on them from the centre of the lake.
