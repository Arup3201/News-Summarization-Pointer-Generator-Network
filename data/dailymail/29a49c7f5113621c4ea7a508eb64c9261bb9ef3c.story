It was a typical society wedding, complete with members of the aristocracy and the obligatory appearance by Pippa Middleton.

But the happy couple’s choice of toast was more suited to The Only Way is Essex than its higher-class Chelsea counterpart.

Guests toasted the bride and groom with Smirnoff Ice, a vodka alcopop flavoured with lemon, and knocked back gin shots before the service, according to onlookers.

Cream delight: Pippa made an entrance wearing a feminine lacy dress by Tory Burch. The £370 silk dress featured a chiffon top with a seahorse pattern while the skirt was made from cream lace

Dates: The 29-year-old arrived at the Church of St Peter and Holy Cross with her date, banker Tom Kingston (left), 34, and younger brother James Middleton (right)

The Duchess of Cambridge’s little 
sister attended the wedding of Verity Evetts and Christopher Buchanan at
the Church of St Peter and Holy Cross, Wherwell, Hampshire.

Showing off her famous figure in a 
skin-tight pale pink £370 Tory Burch Adelaide dress, she looked stylish 
and svelte as she posed for the cameras.

The seahorse-patterned dress is 
described on the American fashion designer’s website as an 
‘entrance-maker’ - something Miss Middleton is well practiced at.

She finished the outfit with a few Middleton favourites.

The required nude patent court shoes 
adopted by Pippa are the Duchess of Cambridge’s secret style weapon, 
elongating her legs and blending effortlessly with any outfit.

Pippa topped off the dress with an 
elegant pale pink felt hat from Whiteley with a long feather quill and a
fabric loop. Her sister Kate already owns the £85 headwear in dark 
blue.

However, a strange lone plait on one side of her hair distracted from the Middleton blowdry which both sisters favour.

The new face of Waitrose arrived with her brother James Middleton and Tom Kingston, a banker friend she is often pictured with.

Style stakes: Pippa wore a beige Whiteley hat, the same style as worn by her sister the Duchess of Cambridge and a small plait at the front of her hair

Timely: Pippa arrived in good time turning up 20 minutes before the service between Verity Evetts and Christopher Buchanan

Social set: Tom Kingson, left, is a regular part of Pippa's social set - the blonde banker and Pippa are said to have met through mutual friends

Eligible: Tom Kingston, 34, a Bristol graduate, is often described as one of London society's most eligible men, and accompanied Pippa to French restaurant Le Caprice in the city's ritzy Mayfair area last month

There was no sign of Nico Jackson, 
her 35-year-old wealthy stockbroker boyfriend. Donna Air, the television
presenter dating James Middleton, was also absent.

As the bride and groom left the 
church, they were pictured clutching bottles of Smirnoff Ice. Guests had
been treated to shots of gin on the way in.

One of the guests was overheard saying: ‘The toffs are getting pissed on Smirnoff Ice.’ 
The list revealed a select group of interconnected people who move in 
exclusive circles, most with connections to the Royal family.

The bride, a 34-year-old former 
barrister who now works for an African investment company, is a friend 
of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and attended the Royal Wedding.

Her ex-boyfriend James Blunt, the Old
Harrovian singer, attended, wearing a pink and yellow tie and swigging 
from his bottle of Smirnoff Ice.

The You’re Beautiful singer arrived 
with his girlfriend Sofia Wellesley - granddaughter of Arthur Valerian 
Wellesley, the 8th Duke of Wellington.

Miss Wellesley attended Edinburgh University with Miss Middleton.

The bride’s brother Captain Rupert 
Evetts is part of the same regiment as the Duke of Cambridge and the 
Royal couple attended his wedding to Chiara Hunt in Austria in September
2008.

She, in turn, is related to 
television presenter Ben Fogle’s wife Marina who also attended the Royal
Wedding and was pictured at Saturday’s wedding.

The couple’s daughter Iona and son Ludo were bridesmaid and pageboy at the wedding.

Jonathan Aitken's daughter Victoria also attended the wedding.

A spokesman from Diageo, makers of Smirnoff Ice, said that the company had ‘no involvement’ in the wedding.
