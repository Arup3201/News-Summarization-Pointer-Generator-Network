High Street store H&M notched up yet another hit collaboration as Anna Dello Russo's bold gold  accessories line was snapped up in moments by frantic shoppers.

Queues formed outside H&M stores from the early hours as shoppers eager to be the first to get their hands on the bold pieces made sure they were at the front of the line.

Wristbands were handed out to those waiting to buy the collection, allowing them a 15-minute slot in the store.

Unlike with previous collections (like Versace and Marni, where extraordinarily high demand was predicted) no quantity restrictions were placed on shoppers this morning - meaning some shoppers left the store with large bags bulging with the jewelled cuffs, gold-framed sunglasses and brightly coloured statement necklaces.

Happy shoppers Lhiag and Louise, both 23, emerge with bags more than they intended on buying

First in the queue at the High Street Kensington branch of H&M were marketing students Lhiag and Louise, both 23, who arrived at 6am.

Lhiag
says she was 'happy and surprised' to be at the front of the line. 'Last time
my friends came here for Marni there was such a long queue by 6am,' she
said, adding that she was keen on snapping up the 'green emerald 
necklace and the earrings.'

Louise says she was at the launch of the Marni 
collection herself and, after witnessing the crowds who turned up for that launch, made sure to arrive in good time today - and had already picked out the pieces she wanted to take home.

'Today I'm looking for the orange necklace. The shoes are too much, 
too fancy,' she said.

Nineteenth in the queue was student 
Taima, 24, from Bahrain, who joined the line at 7.20am. 'I also went to 
Versace and Matthew Williamson's collaborations with H&M,' she said.
'I want to get the trolley bag for my sister, as it's sold out in the 
Emirates.'

Louise and 
Emma-Kutya, both 21, arrived at around 10.50am. 'I'm expecting lots of 
gold, very opulent pieces, statement pieces, bright gold and eccentric 
accessories,' said Louise. 'We really like her snake bracelets and some 
of the crocodile pieces are quite cute.'

Today Lhiag and Louise (pictured) queued outside Kensington's H&M since 6am with coffees and McDonalds only intending to purchase one set of jewellery each but emerged just after 10am with bags full of shopping

While they'd never been to one of H&M's designer collaboration openings before Louise's mother had gone to the Vescace one and encouraged the girls to go.

'It's definitely worth getting up this early,' said Louise.

Julia, 23, from London saw a necklace that she wanted in a magazine and arrived early to make sure she'd bag it. 'It was the green emerald-looking one,' she said. 'I'm just here for that. I've never been to one of these before so I hope I get what I want. It's my day off today so I thought I'd risk it.'

Scenes at Regent Street, London, were hectic as shoppers fought to get their hands on their wish-list items.

A cascade of gold balloons welcomed 
customers into the store as DJ Nikki Beatnik spinned ADR’s ‘Fashion 
Shower’ on the decks. The store was a sea of Anna Dello Russos as face 
masks were handed to shoppers adding to the party atmosphere.

A giant ankle boot and bracelet from the collection took centre stage in store.

The collection, by Vogue 
Japan editor Anna Dello Russo, was a striking line of jewellery, 
sunglasses, shoes, bags predominantly in gold shot through with flashes of 
turquoise, orange and green glass and resin jewels. Animal motifs 
including snakes and crocodiles grace some of the jewellery, and Dello Russo's own pet pooch makes a cameo appearance in clasp of 
one clutch bag.

More expensive items included knee 
high and over the knee thigh skimming boots and an oversized feather 
fascinator. One shopper snapped one up at the Kensington 
store. 'I'll wear it to Halloween parties,' she said.

During the last eight years H&M 
has collaborated with over 15 legendary guest fashion designers with 
spectacular results, and the launch days are always a highlight of a shopper's calendar.

H&M's
creative advisor, Margareta van den Bosh, said ahead of the launch that shoppers were in for a treat.

'There is something feisty and over the 
top in this collection,' she said. 'Our customers will find it 
incredibly exciting and extravagant, with a precious vintage feel. 
Mostly gold, it is truly spectacular: these pieces will give a new life 
to everyone’s wardrobe. The idea is to have luxury that you can play 
with, at an affordable price.'

Anna says her message is to 'use accessories like a 
personal touch, as an amusing way to revitalize your life and wardrobe.'

'You will turn an ordinary day into a sensational fashion week day,' she said.

Dello Russo's favourite bag on offer 
is the turquoise trolley suitcase with gold detail (pictured above).

'I 
wanted to recreate the excitement of the 
fashion weeks tour, when you enter a dreamy fashion bubble that is 
almost like a parallel reality. I tried to capture that sense of 
freedom, joy and excitement,' she said.

She added: 'Besides, when we travel
we always want to bring our special pieces with us. I like the idea of a
trolley that can contain the whole collection and is complete with a 
crown-shaped tag: airports will be less grey and impersonal if you bring
such a token of travel-ware with you.

'It’s like a dash of fairy tale 
magic, or Alice’s white rabbit as a door to a new dimension.'

The next collaboration for shoppers to get their teeth into will be with avant-garde label Maison Martin 
Margiela, which hits stores on 15 November.
