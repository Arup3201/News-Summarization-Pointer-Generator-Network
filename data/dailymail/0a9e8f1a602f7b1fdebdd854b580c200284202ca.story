Lascelles, of Oakwood, Derby, was bailed to appear back at court on March 11 when he is due to enter a formal plea to the charge. 

Judge Jonathan Gosling granted Lascelles conditional bail until his next court appearance, with a preliminary trial date set for the week of Monday April 27.

The centre half has made 11 appearances for Forest this season, picking up three yellow cards.

He and goalkeeper Karl Darlow were bought by Newcastle from Forest in the summer but loaned back to the City Ground.
