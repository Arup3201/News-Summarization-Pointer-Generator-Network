Changes: As the DVLA winds down its printing of tax discs before they are abolished in October, it is no longer printing them on pre-perforated paper

Motorists are being told to cut out their own tax discs as the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency is about to run out of the perforated paper they are usually printed on.

The paper discs will be abolished completely from October 1, but as the DVLA winds down its printing process it will no longer make them on the pre-perforated paper which allows the disc to be easily torn out.

Instead the discs will be printed onto normal paper, and sent to drivers who must cut them out themselves before placing them in their windscreens.

'DVLA is running down its pre-existing stock to ensure there is no wastage. To give value for money to the tax payer we have not replenished our stock for this short period but decided to print these discs in-house until October 1,' the DVLA told affected businesses, according to the Daily Telegraph.

'We have told the police and other enforcement authorities that we have issued these discs however the paper disc is no longer relied upon to check if a vehicle is taxed or not.' 

Drivers must continue to display tax discs in their vehicles until the law changes in just over a month's time, and the change in paper only applies to those discs issued by the DVLA, as the Post Office will continue to use its existing stock.

A DVLA spokesman told MailOnline that the agency had always planned to wind down its stocks of pre-perforated paper prior to the change.

'Tax discs can be expensive to produce and we have always planned to run down stocks in the run up to 1 October,' she said.

'To make sure we deliver the best possible savings to the taxpayer we have not procured more stock for these last few weeks, and will instead print the remaining discs in house.”

'This applies to discs issued by DVLA only – the Post Office will continue to use their existing stock.'

A recent survey has shown that half of drivers are unaware that the paper discs are to be replaced by electronic records.

Police cameras will check number plates to catch owners who have not paid. 

Nearly a third of drivers questioned said they would not even try to find out what the new rules were, according to the poll by the price comparison website money.co.uk.

And 6 per cent of motorists believe that the changes are not coming into force until next year.

Almost a third of those polled said they would wait for instructions from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency.

But the comparison website claims that the DVLA has not yet started adding warnings to tax renewal reminders.

The move away from paper discs, after 93 years, is designed to offer motorists more flexible payment options and make it harder for people to drive without taxing their vehicle.

Estimates show that the changes could save the taxpayer £10million a year. Car owners will still need to have paid vehicle tax to drive on the roads.

But under the new system, the tax will no longer be automatically transferred with a car when it is sold.

Sellers are expected to tell the DVLA straight away of the change of ownership or face £1,000 fines.

Shane Teskey, of the vehicle history website hpicheck.com, said: ‘Those who fail to inform the DVLA could be fined and they will still be liable for any speeding or parking fines and vehicle tax for a car they don’t even own any more.’

Around 53 per cent of drivers said they would use the new option of paying by direct debit, according to the survey. Those choosing to spread the cost by paying twice a year or monthly will incur a 5 per cent additional charge.

However this is half of the 10 per cent surcharge currently applied to six-month tax discs, used by 23 per cent of drivers.

Motorists can also pay annually with no extra cost under the new system.

Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk, said: ‘Changes to the vehicle tax system are no bad thing and we fully welcome the introduction of direct-debit payments, particularly for consumers who may be struggling to keep up with the soaring cost of driving.

‘It will also help to eliminate the problem of people who genuinely forget to renew their tax and end up being stung with a hefty fine.

‘However, I suspect the new system may experience some teething problems, so drivers really need to make sure they’re on top of their game.’

The death of the disc has been well documented, and the change was announced by Chancellor George Osborne in last year’s Autumn Statement.

Automatic number plate recognition cameras will spot motorists who have not paid the tax.

More than 1.7billion tax discs have been issued since 1921, and if they were put in a line, they would go around the world three times.

Last year, the DVLA issued 42.2million tax discs weighing more than 72 tonnes.
