Louis Denyer claims he can speak fluent cat after growing up around the animals and studying their behaviour.

The 29-year-old, who calls himself ‘Cat Man’, communicates by blinking slowly and reading the animal’s body language.

Mr Denyer, who taught himself how to interact with cats by watching documentaries, said: ‘I will make myself vulnerable, before slowly blink at a cat. Nine times out of ten, they will blink back. That is them telling me that they're willing to trust me.’

Louis Denyer, 29, from Lytham St Anne's, Lancashire, claims he can speak fluent cat after developing a special bind with the felines

‘I'm very confident that I have the knowledge to solve a cat's problems. You get to learn what makes a cat tick.’

Mr Denyer, from Lytham St Anne's, Lancashire, grew up around cats and believes his unique bond can help the owners of problem animals.

The self-proclaimed cat whisperer is now offering his services after setting up his own feline behaviourist business.

He said: ‘I'm in it to save cats' lives, that's the whole point of why I'm doing it. ‘I just feel there's too many cases of mistreated cats, and cats that are misbehaving and being punished.

Playtime: Mr Denyer says it's important to spend at least 20 minutes a day playing with your cat to understand them

‘Cats are very territorial animals who need to know they own the whole space where they live.

‘I want to not only help cats but to educate people about them too.’

Problems that Mr Denyer frequently encounters include cats that miss the litter box, cats that spray around the house, and loud meowing at night.

He said: ‘Everything they do is for a reason. I will tackle every issue to stop them from doing it anymore.

Tail:Tail straight up or straight up with a curl at the end: Happy.Tail twitching: Excited or anxious.Tail fur sticks straight up while the tail curls up: Aggression.Tail held low and tucked under the rear: Frightened.Eyes:Dilated pupils: Very playful or excited. It can also indicate aggression.Slowly blinking eyes: Affection.Head:Ears pinned back: Fear, anxiety, aggression.Tongue flicking: Worry, apprehension.Rubbing head, flank and tail against a person or animal: Greeting ritual, ownership claim.Head-butting: Friendliness, affection.Face sniffing: Confirming identity.Wet nose kiss: Affection.Licking: Affection.

‘For example if a cat is missing the litter tray, that tells me that it's territorially insecure. It's desperately trying to mark its territory.

‘I would look at the other causes and see whether it's a change in circumstance, it's not just the cat trying to be naughty.

‘They don't react well to change, and it can make them feel very insecure.’

Mr Denyer, who helps out at Cat Rescue Fylde in St Annes, said he hopes he can teach owners how to understand their pets.

He said: ‘My end goal is to have my own show helping other people to really understand their cat.

‘People don't realise that playing with your cats for 20 minutes and tiring them out will solve a lot of problems.

‘It's as important as taking your dog out for a walk.’

A spokesperson for RSPCA Blackpool said: ‘We don't do anything behaviour wise but I'm sure what he's doing would be beneficial.’
