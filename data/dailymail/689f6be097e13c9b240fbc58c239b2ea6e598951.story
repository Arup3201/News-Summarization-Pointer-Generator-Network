A serial drunk driver who allegedly ran down a woman last week before speeding away has been charged with murder after her family decided to take her off life support.

Raymond Victor Morua, 32, a former Congresswoman's assistant, is accused of hitting Mallory Rae Dies on Friday last week. She died yesterday at 3.15pm after five days in intensive care.

Morua, who has previous convictions for DUIs and a hit-and-run dating back to 2006, allegedly hit Dies just after midnight on December 6 in Santa Barbara, California, after leaving a party where he had been drinking.

According to Noozhawk, witnesses saw Moura stop and look back out of his car before speeding off. They then followed Moura as he drove into a dead end street and tried to convince him to go back to the accident.

According to Santa Barbara police Sgt. Riley Harwood, Moura refused, sped away but lost control of his vehicle before crashing into a palm tree where he was arrested and found to be two times over the limit.

Moura now faces charges of murder, gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated, and leaving the scene of an accident that resulted in death.

He is in custody in Santa Barbara County Jail where he has been refused bail and is scheduled to be arraigned at Superior Court today.

The grade of murder, and maximum sentence which could be imposed, will be decided at a later date.

For two years, until he was dismissed last week, Moura was a district representative for Congresswoman Lois Capps who herself was injured by a drunk driver in 1996.

It was here, in the 500 block of Anacapa Street outside the EOS Lounge, where the accident was said to have happened just after midnight

Lois and her husband, Walter, were hit head on as they made their way home from a press conference. Walter was taken to hospital after suffering broken bones, cuts and internal injuries while Lois received cuts and bruises.

In a statement handed to the Santa Barbara Independent Capps said: 'Words cannot express the sadness I feel over the death of Mallory Rae Dies. This tragedy tugs at the heart of all of us in the community.

'It is clear that Mallory brought light into the many hearts of those who knew her. This senseless — and avoidable — tragedy is one that all of us in the Santa Barbara community will struggle with for a long time.

'I know firsthand what it feels like to lose a child. That anguish is something that no parent should face. My prayers are with her parents and all those who mourn today. I wish her, her family, and her friends peace.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
