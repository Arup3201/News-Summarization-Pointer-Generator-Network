Talk about throwing your weight around.

A 45-year-old Florida man allegedly used his size to resist arrest during an alleged domestic violence incident on Sunday.

Tipping the scales at about 500 pounds, police were called to a house in Deltona by the girlfriend of Howard Hendrix, of Apopka.

The woman said Hendrix had repeatedly slapped her.

Sizable: Investigators said 45-year-old Howard Hendrix, of Apopka, was arrested Sunday afternoon in Deltona, but was too big to fit in a police car

According to Click Orlando, Hendrix was arrested on charges of battery on a law enforcement officer, criminal mischief, resisting an officer without violence, battery causing bodily harm and driving under the influence.

However he is said to have refused to leave the house.

Hendrix then used his weight against deputies by dropping to the floor.

Officers were eventually forced to drag him outside, according to reports.

However they then realized Hendrix was too large to fit in a patrol car.

Hendrix was transported to Volusia County Branch Jail by an alternative means, Click Orlando reported.

However it is unclear exacltly what vehicle was able to take him

Hendrix's girlfriend, 42, said he cornered her in the garage of the home during a fight.

She told police he hit her on the shoulder, poked her in the chest, slapped her face and spat on her.

The girlfriend also claimed Hendrix was intoxicated.
