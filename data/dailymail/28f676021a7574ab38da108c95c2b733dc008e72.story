This is the awkward moment when one of the men behind Britain's first cereal cafe was challenged over selling bowls for £3.20 - just feet away from one of London's poorest areas.

Gary Keely, who founded Cereal Killer Cafe with his twin brother Alan, appeared surprised to learn that the restaurant was located in the deprived borough of Tower Hamlets during a TV interview. 

The out-of-touch hipster even claimed that the niche cafe, which opened earlier this week, was 'cheap'.

Defensive: After being repeatedly asked about whether he thought people in the area could afford to eat in the cafe, Mr Keely demands that the interview is stopped, saying he 'doesn't like the questions'

The cringe-worthy encounter was captured on camera by Channel 4, who spoke to the identical twins on whether local residents could afford to eat at their cafe.

The brothers, from Belfast, opened their venture on Brick Lane - a hipster hotspot and home to a number of quirky cafes. 

But the east London borough is one of the capital's poorest, where more one in two children grow up living in poverty. 

The establishment is heavy on the nostalgia, with limited-edition boxes and collectibles proudly displayed on furniture reminiscent of yesteryear.

The eighties and nineties 'vibe', which is also driving trends in fashion and music, continues with the music choices and vintage magazines. The cafe also employs a 'mixologist' - who combines different types of cereal for customers looking for something different. 

After tasting one of the 120 varieties on offer, priced at £3.20, the journalist asks Gary whether he thought it was a lot to charge for a bowl.

Niches: Along with 120 varieties of cereal, the restaurant also offers 20 toppings and 12 different milk options

The restaurateur seems surprised by the question, responding, 'I think it is quite cheap for the area'.

He is challenged by the interviewer, who points out that the cafe is in one of the poorest parts of London - and asks again whether £3 seemed like a premium price. 

Mr Keely looks to justify the extraordinary cost, explaining that many of the brands are 'imported from America'.

The interviewer then asks what this means for the people who live in the area, where the proportion of children living in poverty has nearly reached 50 per cent. 

Mr Keely responds: 'This isn't one of the poorest areas, is it?'

Imported: Mr Keely says that the reason the cereals cost so much is because some are American brands

The journalist clarifies that it is one of the poorest areas, and asks again whether he thought local people would be able to afford £3.20 cereal. 

Mr Keely responds, 'Well, if they are poor, probably not then.'

The cafe owner becomes defensive and starts asking to stop the interview because 'he doesn't like the questions'. 

The interviewer says that he thinks the questions are fair, but the clip ends shortly after.

Earlier this week, the Keelys spoke about the reason behind opening their cereal cafe.

Gary said: 'We thought "Why isn't there anywhere that you can just go and sit down and have a bowl of cereal?"

'So we went and did some research into it – would it work as a business? How would it look? Where would we get the cereal from? And everything was just ticking all the boxes for us. 

The cafe is open from 7am until 10pm and serves breakfast, lunch and dinner - meaning cereal aficionados can get their fix pretty much anytime of day.

Behind the counter, brightly-coloured boxes line the walls and offerings are as diverse as Golden Grahams and Reese's Puffs to Cap'n Crunch and Apple Jacks. 

Asked about his favourite cereal, he said: 'I really love the Boo-berry, Count Chocula and Franken-berry – these are limited-edition Halloween cereals that are only available one month of the year in America. 

'We've got these, but really limited-edition, so we've only got about 20 boxes of them.'

Located in east London, Tower Hamlets has the highest rate of child poverty in the country - it reached 49 per cent this year, up from 42 per cent last year. 

It also has the second highest unemployment rate in London. Every ward has a higher proportion of people claiming out of work benefits than the London average. 

But the problems are by no means confined to the economic - Tower Hamlets also has very high rates of long term illness and premature death.

Yet this is only half the picture. Tower Hamlets also has some of the highest paid people in London, working in the financial district of Canary Wharf, which has European headquarters for HSBC, Citibank and Barclays. 

The proportion of jobs in Tower Hamlets that are low paid is one of the smallest in the capital.

The borough also boasts booming Brick Lane, which lies at the centre of Britain's hipster culture and is home to a number of quirky bars and restaurants.

At a number of these establishments, including the Cereal Killer Cafe, customers can expect to pay a premium for the out-of-the-ordinary experiences. 

Just down the road from Cereal Killer Cafe is Lady Dinah's Cat Emporium. There, visitors pay £5 to book a table in the cafe, which is home to a number of rescue cats.
