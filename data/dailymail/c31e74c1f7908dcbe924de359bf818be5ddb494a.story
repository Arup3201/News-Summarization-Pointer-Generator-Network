Ronny Deila  confirmed Celtic’s interest in Dundee United winger Gary Mackay-Steven on Tuesday night.

Speaking as the champions ended their winter break in Gran Canaria with a 3-2 defeat to Sparta Prague, the Parkhead boss claimed talk of a pre-contract agreement was news to him, however.

With his current deal expiring at the end of the season, Mackay-Steven looks set to quit Tayside. Sheffield United remain interested, with manager Nigel Clough following up his scouting mission to Hamilton on Monday night with an improved bid of around £100,000 which has been rejected.

Celtic have also now turned their attention to a summer deal for the Scotland cap after another potential target, Wigan forward Shaun Maloney, moved closer to securing a £1million move to Leicester City.

‘We are looking at the best Scottish players, of course,’ said Deila. ‘But we have not done anything.

‘He is one of the players who have done well and of course we are looking, but we have not done anything official.’

Mackay-Steven scored United’s second goal in their 3-2 Premiership win at Hamilton, his fourth strike in the last three matches.

Asked to comment on reports Celtic had made a courtesy call to Dundee United concerning a pre-contract agreement, Deila insisted: ‘That’s new to me. I don’t think so.

‘So far as I know we haven’t made an offer for anybody, so that’s new to me. We will see.’

Set to up the transfer movements when the Parkhead squad return from Gran Canaria, the Norwegian also dismissed reports of interest in Efe Ambrose from West Ham and Crystal Palace.

‘He is going to stay. That’s not true. There are lots of good rumours, though…’

Meanwhile, Celtic legend Murdo MacLeod believes Celtic could hand the title to Aberdeen if they sell Kris Commons this month.

Talks between the midfielder and the club have reached an impasse, with the 31-year-old not as yet being granted his wish of a long-term deal at the club.

With Neil Lennon, the man who brought Commons to Celtic, willing to now take him to Bolton, the future of the fans’ favourite in Glasgow is looking ever more uncertain by the day.

MacLeod says he cannot understand why the situation has got to this stage – and fears Commons’ impending departure might kill Celtic’s chances of pegging back the Dons.

‘I think the Kris Commons situation is the strangest situation in football just now,’ said the 56-year-old.

‘He will be squeezed out of the door if he doesn’t get what he wants.

‘Celtic are a poorer side without him, there’s no doubt about that. He is the one player in the team who has got a spark.

‘It could make the difference between Celtic winning and losing the league if Kris Commons leaves this month.’
