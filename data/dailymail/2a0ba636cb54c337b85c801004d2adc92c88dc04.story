Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola is hoping to lure  defender Raphael Varane away from  Real Madrid with the promise of first team football, according to Marca.

The Spanish publication claim the former Barcelona boss is planning a bid for the 21-year-old, who is growing increasingly frustrated with his lack of first team action.

The news comes as a blow to Jose Mourinho who reportedly sees the French international as the ideal long-term replacement for John Terry in the heart of the Chelsea defence.

Elsewhere in Spain, AS have led with Real Madrid ace Cristiano Ronaldo, who has been voted the most popular player in a poll by UEFA.com, attracting almost 600,000 votes.

The Portuguese attacker may be all smiles, but the same can't be said for Barcelona ace Neymar who has had a pop after he was substituted during the game against Elche.

Neymar was taken off in the 67th minute of the 5-0 cup win, despite scoring twice, and it appears the 22-year-old wasn't all that happy with the decision.

In the Italian press, Corriere dello Sport claim AC Milan are interested in bringing international duo Axel Witsel and Mattia Destro to the club.

The moves are reportedly a response by chairman Silvio Berlusconi to Inter Milan's signing of Xherdan Shaqiri and Lukas Podolski earlier this week. 

Podolski left Arsenal and could be joined in Italy by  Samuel Eto'o, who according to both Corriere dello Sport and La Gazetta dello Sport, is being tracked by Sampdoria.

Tuttosport also go big on the Destro to Milan story, but there is bad news for Juventus as Galatasary midfielder Wesley Sneijder turns down Italian move in favour of Turkish stay.
