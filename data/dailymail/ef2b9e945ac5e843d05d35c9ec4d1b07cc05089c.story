Filmmaker James Marcus Haney traveled to Seattle last month to make a music video for the British band Bear's Den and spend time with his college-age brother and his friends, but their final days before graduation were marred by a deadly campus shooting.

On June 5, former janitor Aaron Ybarra, 26, walked into Seattle Pacific University and opened fire, killing one student and wounding two others, according to police.

Making the video took a backseat to mourning, but Haney’s brother and his circle decided to take part in it anyway as a special way to honor the victims.

Drama: The music video for the song 'Elysium' by Bear's Den shot last month in Seattle captured the moment Seattle Pacific University students learned that a one of their own was gunned down on campus

Raw emotions; Director James Marcus Haney captured moments of grief for the music video starring his brother and his friends

In a first-person account written for NPR, Haney explained that the idea was to use his brother and his classmates in the music video for the song ‘Elysium’ as a way to explore their transition from childhood into adulthood.

‘I wanted to film him and his real friends doing actual things that they normally do,’ Haney writes. ‘I wanted to document the actions and emotions of people at this age — the highs, the lows, the noteworthy and the mundane.’ 

The beautifully shot mini-movie, which was released Tuesday on the band's official YouTube channel, begins with snippets from the lives of kids in their 20s enjoying their last days before leaving the protective bubble of college life.

Turner Haney, James' brother, and his friends are seen drinking beer, kissing, getting inked in a basement, riding a bike with careless abandon and fishing off a pier.

Power of music: Haney wrote that at first, the music video took a backseat to the mourning, but then his brother's friends started listening to 'Elysium' and decided to finish the project

Tribute: In the video, one of the young man wears a sweatshirt honoring the victim, Paul Lee, who loved to dance

The youths standing on the brink of adulthood appear optimistic, filled with joy and a sense of their invincibility.

But in the course filming, the tight-knit Seattle Pacific University community was shaken to the core by gun violence.

In
 the 'Elysium' video, Haney shows the moment students learn of the 
tragedy from a breaking news report on TV while attending a house party.

James Haney writes that at the time of the shooting, he was staying in his brother’s dorm room.

Initially,
 the name of the slain student was not released, but as hours ticked 
off, one young man from a room on the same floor as Turner Haney 
remained unaccounted for.

One
 of the missing student’s dorm-mates spent the night sleeping in the 
hallway outside the elevator waiting for him, and others soon joined 
him. But they were all waiting in vain.

In the morning, it was confirmed that Turner Haney's friend and dorm-mate, 19-year-old freshman Paul Lee, had been shot dead.

Ode to youth: The song 'Elysium' talks about the fleeting beauty of youth and the pain associated with growing up

Reckless abandon: Haney's goal was to preserve some of the remnants of his younger brother's innocence before he stepped into adulthood

Rage: After the shooting, emotions ran high among the students, who sought to vent their anger and pain

The gunman,
 Aaron Ybarra, also wounded Sarah Williams, 19, and Thomas Fowler, 24, 
before he was taken into custody and charged with first-degree murder 
and attempted murder.

In
 his essay, James Haney recalls that the music video became a last 
priority for him amid the heartbreak, and all his thoughts were with his
 grieving brother.

But
 then something strange happened: Turner and his friends started 
obsessively listing to 'Elysium,' playing the track over and over again.

The
 melancholy songs about the fleeting nature and beauty of youth includes
 the words: 'Brother don't grow up.... /Just hope that age does not 
erase all that you've seen/Don't let bitterness become you/Your only 
hopes are within you.'

Rest in peace: The campus shooting claimed the 
life of Paul Lee, 19, a freshman who lived on the same dorm floor as the
 filmmaker's brother, Turner

James Haney writes: 'While in the midst of a dormitory full of very broken and lost students, I couldn't stop listening to the song either — it took on a whole new weight and meaning.'

Turner and his group of friends decided to help his brother finish the video in honor of their slain friend.

In a particularly poignant moment that comes towards the end of the clip, one of the students is seen depositing a maroon sweatshirt with the words 'Dance Paul' - a reference to Lee's passion for dancing - at a makeshift memorial on campus.

'Elysium' is featured on a new record from Bear's Den that will be released in the fall.
