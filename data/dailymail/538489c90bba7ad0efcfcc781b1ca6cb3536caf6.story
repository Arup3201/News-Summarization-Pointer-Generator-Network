Two sisters from New Zealand may have started small, establishing their business from their father's shed, but are now experiencing big success after their beauty products were given the tick of approval by the Duchess of Cambridge.

Trilogy's Certified Organic Rosehip Oil is said to be an essential in Kate's make up bag and the secret to her flawless skin and the 'Kate Effect' means the business' sales are soaring.

The Duchess is understood to have discovered the product when it was gifted to her in a pack from Trilogy when she visited New Zealand last year.

'Kate continues to use rosehip oil in her daily skincare regime,' according to US Weekly.

'She loves the effect is has on her skin. [Her mother] Carole [Middleton] is also a fan.'

The Duchess of Cambridge, who is seven months pregnant with her second child, is said to be a fan of Trilogy's £16.50 rosehip oil

The company was founded by Kiwi eco-conscious sisters Catherine de Groot and Sarah Gibbs in 2002, reportedly whilst they worked in their father's shed in Upper Hutt

At seven months pregnant, the soon-to-be mother-of-two is said to be embracing natural products and loves that the skincare line is made without any potentially harmful retanoids.

Trilogy's international spokeswoman Lisa Wilson said the company was 'absolutely over the moon'.

'Celebrity endorsements of this scale can be transformational for a company,' she said.

'Especially for us, centred down here, it's really quite exceptional to think our product may have made it into the hands of the Duchess of Cambridge.' 

The company was founded by Kiwi eco-conscious sisters Catherine de Groot and Sarah Gibbs in 2002, reportedly whilst they worked in their father's shed in New Zealand's Upper Hutt.

Gibbs was a chartered accountant and De Groot was a former beauty journalist at the time but they shared a vision to create a line of anti-aging products.

Their innovative company was inspired by their discovery of the benefits of rosehip oil to correct fine lines, wrinkles, stretch marks and scars. 

As with anything that Kate is reported to be a fan of, the $21.95 oil has already sold out for Brits online at Boots.com and sales have also increased in the US. 

Kate's influence has already been felt by the company, with Trilogy's share price rising nine per cent to 82 cents the day the news broke. 

It is now well-proven that an endorsement from Kate Middleton can lead to a product selling out within minutes.

When the Queen-to-be was photographed wearing the 'Roamer Day Dress' by Australian brand Zimmerman's at the Easter Show in Sydney in 2014, it quickly flew off the shelves

The Duchess Of Cambridge donned the knee-length summery frock - which retails for $495 - for the second time as she took in the Andy Murray game at Wimbledon in London three months later

A source told the magazine: 'Kate continues to use rosehip oil in her daily skincare regiment. She loves the effect is has on her skin. [Her mother] Carole [Middleton] is also a fan'

This has now aptly become known as 'the Kate effect'.

When the Queen-to-be was photographed wearing the 'Roamer Day Dress' by Australian brand Zimmerman's at the Easter Show in Sydney in 2014, it quickly flew off the shelves.

'The response that we had was immediate and it travelled from around the world. We had people we knew in all sorts of places contact us saying they had seen the coverage,' co-founder Nikki Zimmerman told Vogue.

The brand first began in 1991 when the sisters sold their dresses at Paddington Markets in Sydney.

The effect was again in full force when it took just eight minutes for a Diane Von Furstenberg wrap dress to sell out worldwide when she wore it in the Blue Mountains during the same Royal Tour. 

The Trilogy line is working perfectly for the mother who wants only the best for herself and her baby during her pregnancy. 

'Kate is very cautious of products and treatments,' a source told US Weekly. 'Baby's health comes first.

'Kate continues to use rosehip oil in her daily skincare regiment. She loves the effect is has on her skin. [Her mother] Carole [Middleton] is also a fan.' 

The Kate effect strikes again? The oil has already sold out on Boots.com

The oil's description reads: 'Rosehip oil's potent natural actives make it highly effective for a variety of skin concerns including dehydrated and ageing skin. 

'Trilogy's rosehip expertise ensures the finest quality oil with minimum 80 per cent essential fatty acids (omega 3 and 6) and fatty acid (omega 9) content. Independent clinical studies show it helps improve the appearance of scars, stretchmarks, fine lines and wrinkles.'

Derived from the wild rose bushes that grow high in the Chilean Andes, where the altitude and pollutant-free environment produce the highest quality rosehips, the oil's benefits have been known by the indigenous population for hundreds of years.  

Not only is it rich in vitamin C and high in omega 3 and 6 fatty acids, known to heal scar tissue, it's also a great source of retinoic acid, which studies show reduces the appearance of wrinkles and brightens skin.   

It has also been reported that Deborah Mitchell uses Rosehip Oil in her LIA therapy treatment that Kate loves.

Models David Gandy, right, and Miranda Kerr have also praised the oil's skin-boosting properties 

It is results like these that prompted Kate Middleton's facialist, Deborah Mitchell, to add rosehip oil to her signature LIA therapy treatment.

'Rosehip is perfect for all ages and skin types, including those with sensitive skin conditions like rosacea and acne. I add a drop to moisturiser to boost the results - Kate loves it because it gives skin a luminous glow,'  Deborah told the Daily Mail back in 2012. 

Models David Gandy and Miranda Kerr have also praised the oil.

'I put it on at night and I wake up glowing,' Miranda has said. The model loves it so much that she even created her own version for her Kora Organics skincare line.

A spokesperson for the Duchess of Cambridge declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline.
