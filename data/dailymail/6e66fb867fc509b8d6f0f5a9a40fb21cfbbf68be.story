Athletic Bilbao have waited 16 long years to get back into the Champions League and when their big moment finally came, they got stage fright.

The Basque side had the better of the game against Shakhtar Donetsk but were too worried about their opponents counter-attacking potential to commit as many men forward as they usually do at the San Mames.

Perhaps wary of Basque rivals Real Sociedad’s 2-0 defeat by Shakhtar at Anoeta last season, Athletic seemed to play a tighter game than normal, lacking the drive and thrust we have come to see them employ.

Alex Teixeira scored twice that night and had the ball in the back of the net again for Shakhtar here, but Olexandr Kucher was offside in the build-up so it was ruled out.

Athletic’s supporters, however, were in no mood to let the evening drift by. Generally considered the most passionate fans in the country, they were in good voice as their team got their first Champions League campaign since 1998 underway.

There were also a handful of Scotland flags around the ground, with the Basques, hoping one day for independence from Spain, keenly interested in what happens in the UK.

Ibai Gomez came in for Markel Susaeta from the Athletic side that lost 2-0 at Barcelona on Saturday and he had the first chance of the game, with Darijo Srna blocking well after a rapid Mikel Rico breakaway.

A Taras Stepanenko long-ranger had Gorka Iraizoz down to his left smartly in response. The goalkeeper again had to be alert to deny Shakhtar, with Srna's cross-shot heading for lurking Teixeira at the back-post.

These two sides have vastly different philosophies, with Athletic's Basque-only, youth-team focused policy at direct odds with Shakhtar's blend of a few Ukrainians with some imported Brazilians.

There were six from Brazil in their starting line-up, with four from Ukraine and just Srna from elsewhere. The Croatian has been at the club since 2003 and is their captain.

The likes of Teixeira and Douglas Costa certainly brought some Samba flair to the Basque Country, with plenty of fancy footwork and neat tricks. The latter in particular added some cutting edge to the Shakhtar team.

But it was a bending free-kick from Gomez which get the supporters out of their seats, the ball lurching into the side-netting of Andriy Pyatov's goal, with the relieved keeper left standing.

Iker Muniain is Athletic's most creative player, but despite showing a few bright sparks, he was unable to link up much with veteran hitman Aritz Aduriz in the first half. He tricked his way past Marcio Azevedo but his cross was straight at Pyatov.

Aduriz was screaming for a penalty just before the interval, when Yaroslav Rakitskiy barged into him as he tried to beat Pyatov to a through-ball, but referee Tasos Sidiropoulos was unimpressed.

The Greek official was taking charge of his first Champions League game and dipped into his pocket twice in the first 45, to punish Srna for time-wasting and Taison for diving. Olexandr Kucher soon joined them in the book immediately after the break when he hacked down Aymeric Laporte.

Athletic’s brilliant young centre-back was on a run forward, which was rudely halted by the Shakhtar defender. Benat Etxebarria’s free-kick squeezed through a crowd and Laporte tried to turn it towards goal, but his effort was easy for Pyatov to handle.

It was Laporte again doing great work for Athletic as Shakhtar pushed for the opener, throwing himself heroically in the way of Teixeira’s shot, after the Brazilian came inside from the left.

Muniain, who had worked tirelessly, had a great chance to rampage forward on the break but ran out of steam as he neared the box, with Shakhtar tackling back. Ernesto Valverde hauled him off for youngster Ager Aqueche immediately after, but the crowd stood to applaud the playmaker, chanting ‘Iker’.

It was the last real opportunity of the game, with Shakhtar the more satisfied of the two sides, having earned a valuable away point. For Athletic this is a base to build on, but they need to rid themselves of any fears before their next Champions League clash, a must-win game against BATE Borisov.
