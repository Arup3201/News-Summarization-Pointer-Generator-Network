After two false alarms, one mother was on her way to give birth in hospital - when her daughter had other ideas. 

Zelda Crisler felt contractions last Thursday morning and once again decided to make the drive with husband Devin to Citizens Memorial Hospital in Bolivar, Missouri.

However on the couple's 30-mile journey from Pittsburg, Mrs Crisler knew that the baby would not wait any longer.

Express delivery: Halie Rae Crisler surprised her mother Zelda and was born by the side of the road in Pittsburg, Missouri

She told local TV station KY3: 'We got around the last curve in Pittsburg and I had a really sharp urge to push.'

Her husband Devin pulled their truck in at the Bullseye gas station in the town just in the nick of time.

'I ran around the vehicle and got there just in time, pretty much, just to catch my daughter,' he told the TV station. 

Halie Rae Crisler weighed six pounds, 15 ounces and was doing well along with her mother at the local hospital.
