Microsoft is to take on Apple in a war of the tablet computers with the launch of its own ‘iPad killer’ – the Surface.

It is a dramatic move for the US technology company, which historically has focused on producing software rather than hardware.

But after some success with the Xbox series of entertainment consoles, it now hopes to challenge Apple and Android in the lucrative touchscreen tablet market.

The Microsoft Surface tablet was officially unveiled in Los Angeles last night, and from the favourable first impressions, it looks like we have a three-way race in the tablet market.

The Surface comes with a 10.6" screen, a clever magnetic cover which doubles as a keyboard, and a kickstand to hold it upright on a table.

In a huge paradigm shift for Microsoft, the traditional Windows Desktop has been scrapped for Microsoft's new 'Metro' tile-based theme.

The new laptop-esque Surface tablet computer is unveiled by Microsoft, bringing a revolutionary jump to the future of Windows

Microsoft Surface: The new tablet, shown here in the hands of CEO Steve Ballmer, will compete with the iPad

Launch: The tablet is Microsoft's first foray into personal computing hardware for many years

Presentation: The contents of the launch were kept completely secret until the announcement was made

Boss: Mr Ballmer shows off Microsoft's latest gadget at a press conference in Los Angeles

The iPad has been King of the tablet market since its debut in 2010

Surface comes with a number of features which make it more similar to a laptop than a tablet - most notably, a built-in keyboard which could help the device appeal more to business customers.

And the fact that Microsoft is using the same Windows 8 operating system for the Surface as for laptop and desktop computers could mean that customers will find it easier to switch between different devices.

CEO Steve Ballmer was 
on hand at a press conference in Los Angeles to announce the tablet, calling it part of a 'whole new family 
of devices' the company is developing.

The 9.3mm-thick tablet, which uses the RT version of Windows, comes with a kickstand to hold it upright and keyboard that
is part of the device's cover. It weighs under 1.5 pounds.

In a possible nod to the device's chief rival, it will apparently be 0.1mm thinner than the latest iPad.

A slightly thicker version - still less than 
14mm thick and under two pounds - will work on Microsoft's 
upcoming Windows 8 Pro operating system.

Colourful: The Surface is expected to be available for purchase some time later this year

Visionary: Microsoft has high hopes that the Surface will allow it to break in to the lucrative tablet market

Adaptable: The device is designed to function both as a tablet and as a more traditional laptop

Weight:Surface 676g iPad 650g

Thickness:Surface 9.3mm iPad 9.4mm

Screen size:Surface 10.6" iPad 9.7"

USB:Surface yes iPad no

Hard drive:Surface 32GB/64GB iPad 16GB/32GB/64GB

Battery life:Surface unknown iPad around 6 hours

Price:Surface unknown iPad from £479/$499

Steven
Sinofsky, the president of Microsoft's Windows division, called the 
device a 'tablet that's a great PC - a PC that's a great tablet.'

They will be available when Windows 8 ships later this year, according to a Microsoft statement.

No details on pricing were mentioned, except that it would be 'comparable' with current ARM tablets and Intel-powered Ultrabooks.

Microsoft has been 
making software for tablets since 2002, when it shipped the Windows XP 
Tablet PC Edition.

Many big PC makers produced tablets that ran the 
software, but they were never big sellers. The tablets were based on PC 
technology, and were heavy, with short battery lives.

Launching its own tablet potentially 
throws Microsoft into direct competition with its closest hardware 
partners such as Samsung and Hewlett-Packard.

The price of the tablet, which will come in 32GB and 64GB versions, has not been revealed, but the 32GB iPad costs from £479. Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer said the tablet will be an entertainment device ‘without compromising the productivity that PCs are uniquely known for’.

Apple has sold 67million iPads in the past two years, and Microsoft is keen to grab a piece of a market where analysts predict sales will top 180million a year in 2013.

But industry experts questioned whether the company could mount a serious challenge to Apple.

Sarah Rotman Epps, of technology analysts Forrester, said Microsoft had to spell out how the Surface would be different from the iPad.

She added: ‘They need to explain how Microsoft manufacturing this device will change people’s experience with a tablet.’

Eddie Wrenn looks at the history of three titans - Apple, Microsoft, and Google - as they battle for dominance.

Acceptable in 2006: Windows Mobile just before the first iPhone came out

Microsoft has dragged its feet a bit too long in the tablet market - in almost an exact repeat of the smartphone market.

The iPhone revolutionised the smartphone market in 2007, and then the iPad kickstarted the tablet craze in 2010.

When it came to smartphones in 2006, Microsoft were the entrenched market-leader.

The Windows Mobile 6.5 operating system - which was outstandingly ugly and built for a stylus, but very flexible software-wise - had more than 90 per cent of the smartphone market just seven years ago.

It was very unintuitive - but it was all the market had, and users had to wait for the at-the-time small-fry hardware manufacturer HTC to come along and build a skin to show Microsoft that technical prowess could go hand-in-hand with eye-candy.

Meanwhile Microsoft could not not have a decent tablet to market.

They had kept trying to at least create the market, but kept missing the key features people wanted: portability, usability and style.

But Microsoft could never get deliver anything beyond clunky 
interfaces or heavy, style-less hardware in either market, and so they limited their 
potential to niche appeal.

With Apple breaking new ground, this should have given Microsoft a clear goal to step in and join an established market.

And this would have been fine, if it was not for the Rise of Google -
or more importantly, Android.

Once Apple paved the way, Google swooped 
in with their open-sourced, flexible and  well-received operating 
system.

Hardware manufacturers, locked out of Apple's closed world, could 
adapt Android with almost no cost and no restrictions, and quickly a 
swarm of smartphones, and then tablets, swamped the market - some great, 
some good, and others terrible.

The sad thing for Microsoft is that this used to be them - they could
license their software and different vendors, such as Dell, or HP, 
could build computers or smartphones.

But Google has all but cleared up this market, and Microsoft being late to a market once again could be be deadly to the giant.

Windows Phone 7, despite a warm reception from critics and 
whole-hearted support from Nokia, still languishes at the bottom of the 
mobile market, unable to gain mass-traction.

It is still behind the long-dead Windows Mobile for market-share, despite all of Microsoft's advertising pushes.

But whereas it took about four years for Microsoft 
to compete with the iPhone, luckily the gap for the tablet market is 
only around two years.

This may change over the next few years, but it will be hard to break
into either Apple's hardcore fanbase, or Android's million activations worldwide a
day.

The Surface may not have the same hurdles. Business professionals may find this a suitable netbook or laptop replacement. Those who do not find Apple or Google's offerings good for productivity may swarm to Microsoft.

And as Microsoft unifies the experience within all its markets and builds its own eco-system, containing Windows 8 on the PC, Windows Phone 8, and the Metro-themed entertainment of the Xbox 360, they may win back a lost generation of people who like Microsoft's technical expertise.

Slim: The Surface is - perhaps not coincidentally - 0.1mm thinner than its chief rival, the iPad

Innovative: But Microsoft has not yet announced how much the Surface will cost when it goes on sale

Each device comes with a kickstand to hold it upright and a keyboard that is part of the device's cover

Components: Microsoft's Panos Panay gives the audience an inside look at the tablet's built-in keyboard

Trendy: Microsoft appears to have learned something from rival Apple when it comes to presentation

Sales of tablets are expected to triple in the next two years, topping 180million a year in 2013, easily outpacing growth in traditional PCs. Apple has sold 67million iPads in two years since the device's launch.

Apple, which makes both hardware and software for greater control over the performance of the final product, has revolutionised mobile markets with its smooth, seamless phones and tablets.

Rival Google may experiment with a similar approach after buying phone maker Motorola this year.
