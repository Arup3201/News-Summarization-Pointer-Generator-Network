A man accused of murdering his teenage wife almost 17 years ago has been granted bail in the New South Wales Supreme Court after the introduction of more lenient bail laws.

Steven Frank Fesus, 42, is alleged to have murdered his then 18-year-old wife Jodie Fesus in the NSW Illawarra region in August 1997.

Five weeks after the mother-of-two's disappearance, her remains were discovered in a shallow grave at a popular camping site at Seven Mile Beach after a tip-off from an anonymous caller.

Steven Frank Fesus, 42, was granted bail at the New South Wales Supreme Court despite being charged with murdering his former wife, Jodie

Fesus wasn't charged with her killing until last year, when police decided to renew their investigations with newly developed and improved forensic technologies.

Since his arrest in July, the former security guard has made a number of unsuccessful bail applications.

However on Monday he was granted bail at the NSW Supreme Court.

The decision comes following the overhaul of the Bail Act in NSW.

Jodie Fesus (left) was only 18 when she was killed. The mother-of-two was found in a shallow grave at Seven Mile Beach 17 years ago

Under the changes, which came into effect two weeks ago, the court now determines whether bail should be granted on the basis of whether the applicant poses an unacceptable risk to the community if released.

Previously, the decision on whether someone was granted bail was based on the type of offence and the presumption for or against their release.

Fesus, who appeared in court via audio-visual link from Goulburn prison, said nothing during the application.

He is set to appear at the Wollongong Local Court on Wednesday.

Despite being denied bail numerous times, Mr Fesus was finally granted bail following the overhaul of the Bail Act in New South Wales. It used to be given based on the type of offence but now only is refused if the applicant poses an unacceptable risk to the community if released

When announcing that police would be re-opening the case, Detective Chief Inspector Lehmann said investigators were re-examining key evidence collected back in 1997.

'Jodie Fesus was the mother of two young children who were aged just one and two years old at the time she was murdered,' he said in a statement.

'Those children are now teenagers who have grown up without ever getting to know their mother.

'In short, we will do everything we can to solve this murder so that Jodieâ€™s family can finally have some closure.'
