A 22-year-old former netball captain says she ‘lost everything’ when severe ME caused her to be bedridden and to develop the 'bones of a 100-year-old'.

Jessica Taylor, from Rochester, Kent, spent four continuous years in hospital and has not left her bed for seven years.

While she was in hospital, she was so ill she couldn't recognise her family, had to be tube-fed and was unable to move anything other than her head.

Four of the nine years Jessica has been ill, have been spent in hospital

As she has been in bed for so long, Jessica has now developed severe osteoporosis and was told by doctors that she has ‘the bones of an 100-year-old’.

She remains so weak she is barely able to sit up and just moving from her bed to a chair requires the use of a hoist.

Jessica told MailOnline: ‘My life is a world of one room. The ME caused me to lose everything in the end.

‘I’ve got a fight on my hands and I believe I am going to get better.’

Jessica first fell ill when she was 14.

She suffered a bout of the flu which she never recovered from and, despite trying to push herself, her health rapidly deteriorated and within nine months she was bedridden.

For two years Jessica (pictured in an ambulance) had to be fed through a tube and for 18 months she was unable to speak. She was also sensitive to light and sound so had to wear sunglasses and ear protectors

She said: ‘I loved life and I wanted to be out there living it.

‘I put my illness to the back of my mind thinking it would go, but it didn’t happen that way.’

She added: ‘I was a lover of life and until ME hit, I was always out doing things.’

Doctors initially thought Jessica was suffering from glandular fever but her condition rapidly deteriorated until she was so weak she required a wheelchair.

Soon afterwards, she was confined to her bed.

Jessica (pictured before her illness) was the captain of her school's netball team before her illness and says she was 'a lover of life'

She said: ‘I tried to push myself, I wanted to achieve things and I wanted to do what everyone else was doing.

‘It was shocking – I had gone from being a healthy captain of netball to being stuck in a wheelchair.

‘The irony is that now a wheelchair would represent freedom for me.’

Jessica stopped attending school at the age of 15 and, in 2006, was admitted to hospital.

She spent four years in Medway Maritime Hospital in Gillingham, Queen’s Hospital in Romford, and Burswood Hospital in Tunbridge Wells.

After leaving hospital Jessica required round-the-clock care and has a carer for 12 hours a day

For 18 months she was so ill she was unable to speak or to understand anything that was being said to her and for two years she had to be fed through a tube.

She was also extremely sensitive to light and sound meaning she had to wear sunglasses and earplugs constantly.

She was unable to move at all other than to shake or nod her head and she required 24-hour a day care, including being washed and using a bedpan.

She said: ‘It was incredibly painful. The fatigue is so intense it actually hurts.’

Having spent four continuous years in hospital, Jessica recovered sufficiently to return home part-time.

Jessica (pictured with her sister, Ruby) says she still believes that she can get better but that even if her ME improves, the osteoporosis will hold her back

For two years she lived a life moving in and out of hospital.

She has only recently moved home full-time and she still requires round-the-clock nursing care.

She has a carer for 12 hours a day and her parents, Kate and Colin, and sister, Ruby, 18, care for her during the night.

Jessica said: ‘It’s made us very tough – well bonded together. We are very protective of each other.’

She added: ‘I think my illness made my sister miss out on a lot of her childhood – the illness affects the whole family.

Jessica (pictured with her mother and sister) said: 'I want to be well and I believe that can happen. I have high hopes of being able to walk and to do things for myself'

‘The attention inevitably has to be on the sick person and when I came home she looked after me.

‘She would say, though, that it was ok because she had her sister home.’

When she was 19, Jessica was also told she had severe osteoporosis because her bones had been weakened by lack of use.

She said: ‘My bones are very weak – just sitting up I have to be extremely careful as I am at risk of breaking my back or hips.

‘I have to do really gradual movements and when I am lifted up I have to have a sling to protect my fragile body.’

Jessica (pictured before her illness) said: 'My bones are very weak - just sitting up I have to be extremely careful as I am at risk of breaking my back or hips'

She explained that even if her ME improves, her life will still be seriously restricted as a result of her osteoporosis.

She told MailOnline: ‘When I start to make improvements I am stopped by the osteoporosis.

‘I am still suffering severely – I can only do half an hour of activity, such as using my computer, before having to rest for half an hour.

‘I am currently trying to get used to sitting in a chair but I have to be hoisted into it and I suffer dizziness and nausea when I sit up.’

She is also so weak, and her muscles so wasted, that she is in danger of developing a dangerously fast heart rate if she tries to sit up.

Jessica (pictured with her parents, Kate and Colin, and her brother, Tom, and sister, Ruby) has now launched a charity called Share A Star from her bed

Jessica has recently launched a charity called Share A Star from her bed.

The charity aims to help improve the lives of sick children.

She said: ‘I have lots of plans – Share a Star is now a massive part of my life.

‘I want to be well and I believe that can happen. I have high hopes of being able to walk and to do things for myself – the important thing is to gain some independence and then go to bigger things from there.’

She added: ‘I have so much to live for so have never been depressed – I believe you have to deal with the cards you are dealt.

‘I’d much rather be living but I don’t get angry – it’s just a waste of energy and I don’t have much of that!

‘A key thing for me is to retain a sense of humour and a positive outlook – those things are vital.’

Share A Star aims to improve the lives of sick children by making them feel special and by sending them goody bags in hospital. Jessica is pictured with some of the books and toys that go into the goody bags

Share a Star aims to make children who are in hospital feel special and sends them packs of goodies to relieve boredom.

Jessica said: ‘We can’t offer the cure but we can help the every day. We are there through the journey.’

In October, a team of runners, including Jessica's sister, Ruby, and her brother, Tom, ran the Bupa Great South Run to raise funds for Share A Star.

The charity is now looking for runners to take part in the Bupa Great North Run 2014. 

Anyone who is interested can enter the general ballot which opens on January 7 at greatrun.org 

Myalgic encephalomyelitis is a chronic condition that causes persistent fatigue that is not improved by sleep or rest.

Myalgic means muscle pain and encephalomyelitis means inflammation of the brain and spinal cord.

The condition can cause long-term illness and disability but many sufferers - particularly children and young people - improve over time.

It is estimated to affect about 250,000 people in the UK and is more common in women than men.

It usually develops in the early 20s to mid-40s but children can also be affected - usually between the ages of 13 and 15.

Most cases of ME are mild or moderate but up to one in four people with the condition have severe symptoms.

Mild ME is defined as that which still allows the sufferer to care for themselves but means they may need to take days off to rest.

Moderate ME is that which causes reduce mobility, disturbed sleep and the need to sleep during the day.

Severe ME means the sufferer has severely reduced mobility.

Aside from exhaustion, other symptoms include muscle pain, nausea, a sore throat, dizziness and sensitivity to light and sound.

It is not known what causes it but it could be linked to a viral infection, an immune system problem, a hormone imbalance or a psychological problem.

There is no cure but treatment options include cognitive behavioural therapy and medication to control pain and sleeping problems.
