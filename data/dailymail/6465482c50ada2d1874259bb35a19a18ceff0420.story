Labour's chances of regaining power are under serious threat from looming ‘annihilation’ by the SNP in Scotland and an unprecedented surge by the Greens in the rest of the country, polls suggested yesterday.

A Survation survey suggested Labour are set to lose all but five of their 40 MPs in their traditional Scottish stronghold in May’s general election.

It also showed that just two per cent of Scots say they completely trust Ed Miliband – far less than the 24 per cent who professed belief in the Loch Ness monster in a separate poll conducted in 2012.

The latest figures, a record lead for the SNP, would dramatically reduce Labour’s tartan army of MPs, jeopardising Mr Miliband’s chances of becoming the next prime minister.

It would also put the SNP in a position to determine who should form the next Westminster government, either by entering a coalition or offering to support a minority government.

Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond, addressing the Holyrood parliament for the final time before bowing out, dropped his heaviest hint to date that he intends to return to Westminster.

Mr Salmond, who was last week replaced as leader of the SNP by his former deputy Nicola Sturgeon, said it had been the ‘privilege’ of a lifetime to serve in the post he has held since 2007.

In a nod to growing speculation that he is planning to be a key figure in Westminster in another hung Parliament, he said: ‘I have absolutely no idea if my experience of minority government in this place will come in handy in another place.’

The Scottish survey confirmed recent polls showing an extraordinary surge for the SNP in the aftermath of its defeat in September’s independence referendum.

A separate poll conducted in 2012 found that 24 per cent of people professed belief in the Loch Ness monster

It put support for the party for next year’s general election at 46 per cent, compared with 24 per cent support for Labour. The Conservatives were on 17 per cent and Liberal Democrats six.

The SNP said it was the largest lead for the party in Westminster that Survation has ever recorded.

Those who would lose their seat include Jim Murphy, who is standing to be the next leader of Scottish Labour and Labour’s election campaign chief Douglas Alexander.

SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson said: ‘This is enormously encouraging. It reflects all recent surveys in underlining the strength of the SNP vote, and is a further demonstration that Labour and the other Westminster parties are facing a major backlash in Scotland.

‘With a majority of people in Scotland saying that they distrust Ed Miliband, David Cameron and Nick Clegg, this poll is a disaster for all three Westminster parties.

‘We take absolutely nothing for granted, and know there is a huge amount of hard work to be done in the weeks and months ahead - but there is no doubt that the SNP have momentum going into next year’s Westminster election.

‘These record leads for the SNP reflect the fact that people are putting their trust in the SNP to stand up for Scotland, and ensure that the ‘extensive new powers’ we were promised by the Westminster parties in the referendum are delivered.’

Those who would lose their seat include Jim Murphy, who is standing to be the next leader of Scottish Labour and Labour’s election campaign chief Douglas Alexander.

Separately, a YouGov poll across the UK put the Greens on a record high of eight per cent – suggesting it is eating into the disaffected former Liberal Democrat supporters who Labour had been banking on for victory.
