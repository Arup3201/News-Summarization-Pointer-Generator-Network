Last weekend one of the nation's largest and most popular music festivals was held, with more than 81,000 people in attendance over the two days.

Of those thousands attending Stereosonic at the Sydney Showgrounds, 830 were stopped by police, taken into a booth, stripped down and searched for drugs by officers.

Danny, 27, was one of those people. Except he had no drugs on him, is not a drug taker, and had not come into contact with any illegal substances.

This comes as new research revealed that thousands of innocent Australians are subjected to humiliating strip searches in similar situations every year, while 64 percent of sniffer dog detections are incorrect.

Danny (not pictured) told Daily Mail Australia how he was detected by a sniffer dog and strip searched at Stereosonic festival on Saturday

'A sniffer dog sat down next to me and they took me off into a little booth,' Danny said, referring to the way dog are trained to sit when they detect the scent of drugs on a person.

'I had to take off my pants, shirt, shoes, everything,' Danny - who did not wish for his surname to be published - told Daily Mail Australia. 

'It was violating... It was very confronting.

'I felt ostracised and like there was something wrong with me, and told I had something on me when I didn't,' Danny said.

Initially the Sydney man was asked to handed over his identification and wallet - which officers spent a number of minutes 'scrambling' through.

Then he was taken into a booth which he estimated to measure about 5 metres square and forced to remove all his clothes. 

'They go through everything you have on you, your clothes, move to your shoes and bang them on the desk to make sure nothing falls out.'

The 27-year-old (not pictured) was not carrying any drugs, and a scent had been incorrectly detected on him by a sniffer dog

'I was just standing there with no clothes on while there's two big police officers going through everything.'

'They were continuously asking me the same questions over and over again, and quite forcibly.

'(They asked) "Do you take drugs?" "Do your friends take drugs?" "Were you taking drugs yesterday?",' Danny said.

The 27-year-old was also forced to, while naked, hold his genitals and bend over so police could be sure wasn't concealing anything.

Although at no time during the search did police touch the 27-year-old,  he said the 10 minute long ordeal was very uncomfortable, especially as he is not a drug user and maintained he had never come into contact with anything of the sort.

'I was quite calm because I didn't have anything on me, (but) it was violating, quite an uncomfortable experience,' said Danny.

While he acknowledged the police were doing their job, his issue was with the 'confronting and intimidating' way officers carried out the search and 'assumed I was guilty', which he was not.

Over 830 of the 81,000 people who attended the festival were searched for illicit substances

The Sydney man also condemned the use of sniffer dogs saying he thinks they're both unnecessary and inaccurate, and do more harm than good.

'I'm not a fan of it... I had a pretty low opinion of it in the first place... 75 percent of the time or more they pick up people who don't have anything on them,' Danny claimed.

'It's never going to stop people from taking drugs, it might just force them to take them before the festivals. It's dangerous.'

This comes as Fairfax Media revealed invasive strip and cavity searches by police have increased by nearly a third over the past five years.

Data obtained by the media group also showed than at least 10,000 people per year are wrongly subjected to these humiliating searches, where they're forced to strip down a bend over to prove they have nothing to hide.

Further to this, sniffer dogs incorrectly identify people to be carrying drugs when they're 64 percent of the time.  

'It's kind of funny they've got one dog to pick up a scent from an area full of thousands of people,' Danny said. 

Over all 220 people were charged with drug offences over the two day Stereosonic festival, and police said they were 'disappointed' with the high number of arrests.

A 21-year-old was found collapsed and was rushed to hospital not breathing, while another 12 also attended emergency rooms for mostly drug-related illnesses.
