Talented law student Dhelcy Mae Caberte 19, from Cardiff who was found dead in her halls

A talented young law student - described by friends as a 'golden girl' -Â  has been found dead in her room at university after breaking up with her boyfriend.

Dhelcy Mae Caberte, 19, was said to have excelled at everything she did in life and was academically gifted.

But the student told close friends she was feeling sad and depressed after splitting with her long-term boyfriend.

One of her tearful student friends, who did want to be named, said they had tried to support her through the break-up.

She said: 'Out of all of my friends Dhelcy was the one I had the most fun with.

'She was a golden girl with a lovely smile that won people over as soon as they met her.

'I know breaking up with her boyfriend had upset her and she was struggling to get over it.

'But she could be up one minute and down the next, she was an emotional person.'

Dhelcy, from Cardiff, was offered an unconditional place to study law at Nottingham Trent University before passing her A-levels with top grades last summer.

She had just finished her second term when friends found her dead at the halls of residence where she lived.

Police are investigating and a post mortem examination is being carried out, but her death is not believed to be suspicious.

Her heartbroken parents, originally from The Philippines, travelled to Nottingham after being told Dhelcy was found dead shortly after midnight on Monday.

The couple have a nine-year-old son who is in primary school in Cardiff.

Dhelcy came to Britain from Manila six years ago and started at Bishop of Llandaff School in Cardiff where she excelled.

Her friend said: 'She was always so happy and outgoing - she was great fun to be with.

'She was very talented in school and would have been a great lawyer.

'I saw her a few weeks ago when she came home from university and we said we would meet up over the Easter holidays.

'She had told her close friends she was depressed but no one thought it would come to this.'

Two months ago Dhelcy landed a part-time job at the Capital FM Arena in Nottingham to help pay her way through university.

Police were yesterday interviewing Dhelcy's family and student friends to discover her state of mind in the days leading up to the tragedy.

A police spokeswoman said: 'Officers were called to an address where a 19-year-old woman was pronounced dead at the scene.

'Following inquiries into the circumstances surrounding the death, detectives are satisfied there were no suspicious circumstances.'
