Representatives of Radiohead today denied local media reports that the band's guitarist Jonny Greenwood is hiding out in a rural Brazilian hotel to 'wait for the end of the world'.

Numerous Brazilian media have claimed the 41-year-old is holed up in a self-sufficient guest-house in rolling countryside near the city of Sao Luiz do Paraitinga, in the state of Sao Paulo, in preparation for December 21.

That day marks the end of the Mayan Calendar and is considered by some as the date that will mark the end of the world.

Brazilian media have reported that Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood is currently waiting for the 'end of the world' in a rural guest-house in Sao Paulo

Owner of the Catuçaba hotel, Frenchman Emmanuel Rengade, said: 'The reason why he's here is to get away, because hotels like this preserve the privacy of the guests and he does not want publicity.'

The city's Tourism Minister, Eduardo de Oliveira Coelho, told the Folha de Sao Paulo news website that Greenwood had arrived earlier this month.

He also claimed that other band members were expected to join him in the next few days.

The presence of the star was confirmed to the publication by both the politician and hotel owner.

Coelho added that Greenwood was planning to provide free classes to youth in the city and extend his stay there if the supposed Mayan premonition did not come about.

But the band's management, Courtyard management, today insisted that the musician is not even in the country and the reports are completely untrue. 

Radiohead have sold more than 30 million albums worldwide and were ranked number 73 in Rolling Stone's list of The Greatest Artists of All Time in 2005.

Both Jonny Greenwood and Ed O'Brien have both been included in Rolling Stone's list of greatest guitarists while Thom Yorke is in their list of greatest singers.

In 2009, Rolling Stone readers voted the group the second best artist of the 2000s.
