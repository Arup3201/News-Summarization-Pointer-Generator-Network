The owner of a Portland, Oregon microhome built of recycled materials is worried other tiny house dwellers are selling out.

Phoenix and her partner's set of two 364-square-foot homes use Trader Joe's bags for wallpaper and tin cans for shingles, but not every micro-home owner is quite as frugal.

'Most of the tiny houses out there are mini-McMansions,' Pheonix says.

Perfectly small: The owner of two Portland micro-homes says the tiny, frugal life is perfect for her family but fears the micro-home trend is losing touch with its roots

'Most of the tiny houses out there are mini-McMansions,' says owner Pheonix as she stands in front of one of her two 364 square foot cottages

Phoenix lives in the set of miniature houses with her 24-year-old son and partner. They've personalized their abode out of found and repurposed goods like old bean sacks and hammered tomato sauce cans from a local pizza shop and she believe that's how things should be.

'This whole [tiny home] movement is about originality and creativity,' Phoenix says in a video by Kirsten Dirksen.

Though short on space, creativity is something the homes do not lack.

Phoenix's partner points out some more architectural quirks, such as the historical context of their porch swing.

'This is huge': Pheonix says she and her son, who lives in one of the two homes, used to live in a 3,500 square foot home in Maryland and hated it. She even thinks her tiny Portland abode is kinda roomy

'Mid to late 19th century Dairy Queen,' he jokes. 'It's a Dairy Queen Formica bench.'

The cramped quarters are made surprisingly livable thanks to vaulted ceilings, lots of sun and storage tricks like folding tables and a hideaway wine rack.

Also notable are the window flower box made from a repurposed kitchen stove hood and light sconces made from roof tiles.

'We don't take our architectural pieces too seriously,' says Mr. Phoenix. 'We're after the cute factor.'

Everything tells a story: Inside the home, the walls are covered in old bean sacks and Trader Joe's bags, some of which still have their handles

Phoenix says the family used to live in a 3,500 square foot, four bedroom home in Maryland that had seven entrances but it never really felt like home.

Downsizing has given the family a new lease on life, and even though their new haunt is a tenth the size of their old one, they're much happier.

'And this,' says Phoenix, 'is huge.'

Pheonix's home has become a bit of a tourist attraction, but she says she glad to help spread the gospel of the micro-home lifestyle
