Wales captain Sam Warburton says a strong emphasis has been put on collective self-analysis by his players ahead of Sunday's RBS 6 Nations appointment with Scotland at Murrayfield.

It is eight years since Wales were last toppled by the Scots, but they will head to Edinburgh following a confidence-shaking Millennium Stadium loss against England six days ago.

Wales failed to score a point in the second half as England impressively wiped out a 16-8 interval deficit, leaving Warburton and company facing an uphill task during this season's Six Nations tournament.

Two years ago, Wales were beaten by Ireland in their opening game, but they recovered superbly to reel off four successive wins, culminating with a record 30-3 demolition of England.

And Warburton's men face doing it the hard way again, with three of their next four games - Scotland, France and Italy - being away from home.

'We need to try and play a bit more rugby,' Warburton said.

'That is what we are about, and when we play well we get our key players in the game and get some go-forward.

'Teams are starting to play a little bit less rugby against us and it's how we can adapt to that.

Warburton is looking for his side to respond following the disappointing defeat by England in opener

'We have spoken about it as players, and if it happened again I think we would respond a lot better than we did last Friday.

'Everybody has had a really good look at their own game and how they can improve, whether it's contact area or a front-row forward at the scrum.

'I would never question the effort of anyone, but sometimes you have to think on the move and it's not down to the coaches. They are not on the field with us and we have to figure it out ourselves. Players will take responsibility for that.

'We went in at half-time after Dan Biggar's drop-goal and felt in control.

'Things were going to plan but in the second half England slowed up a lot of our ball, were effective at the tackle area, drove a lot of their lineouts and didn't give us too much possession. They got their tactics right and we didn't react to that.'

Wales head coach Warren Gatland has made just one change for the Edinburgh trip, with Liam Williams replacing rested wing George North.

And for the Wales forwards especially it represents a chance to redeem themselves, given how much domination England enjoyed up-front.

Warburton added: 'We had a forwards meeting this week that was scheduled to be five to 10 minutes, but it went on quite a bit longer than that.

'It was good talking through our decision-making at certain lineouts, what our thought process was and what we could do to change things.

'A lot of players spoke up about their own roles and it's better than sitting down and having the coaches telling us X, Y, Z and what we should, or shouldn't, have done.

The atmosphere at the Millennium Stadium was electrifying both before and during the contest

England head coach Stuart Lancaster has hailed his side's 21-16 win against Wales in the Six Nations

'They let the players figure it out for ourselves because that is what we will have to do in a game.

'There was a lot said and it was a productive morning. We didn't do a lot of training but the amount of talking that we did will help us moving forward.

'It's always an arm-wrestle for quite a long time against Scotland and, looking at them now, their line speed is excellent in defence and it will be another big challenge for us.

'We need to get back to winning ways and it is must-win because if we want to win the championship we are going to have to win all four of our remaining games.

'One step at a time, but we have to win on Sunday.'
