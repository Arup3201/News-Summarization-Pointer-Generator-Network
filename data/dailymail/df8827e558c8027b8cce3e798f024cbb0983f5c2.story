Few things have had more influence on science-fiction than Star Trek, and (most) fans breathed a sigh of relief when J.J. Abrams's 2009 reboot of Gene Roddenberry's classic series stayed respectful to the source material.

Thankfully, from the look of these latest screens, the video game will do so, too. Although most details are being kept under wraps, gameplay sees Kirk and Spock working together to stop the legendary Gorn from conquering the galaxy.

Interestingly, although combat revolves around a cover-system similar to that found in the Gears of War games, there's a strong focus on teamwork.

Spock and Kirk will both have their own special abilities that reflect their unique characteristics. Kirk can call for an aerial assault from the Enterprise, while Spock can mind melt, perform the Vulcan death grip and use the tricorder to find enemy weak points.

Although there has been some concern from fans that the game would be straight-forward shooter, Brian Miller, vice president of Paramount told Eurogamer last year: 'You will have elements of a shooter. You'll have elements of exploration, and adventure and discovery. This is what the new Star Trek is about.'

The game is powered by Digital Extremes' Evolution Engine, most notably used in Dark Sector and The Darkness II. Early gameplay footage revealed last year already looked graphically stronger than both of those titles.

Particularly impressive were the well-rendered environments which conveyed the impressive sense of scale fundamentally required in such a title.

It promises a 'sweeping journey' across unexplored planets and enemy battleships, and players will have full access to all of the latest 23rd century gear.

Speaking to MailOnline, Lee Kirton Marketing and PR Director at Namco Bandi, said: 'It’s great to see that the release of STAR TREK: The Video Game has caused so much interest. Paramount Pictures have spent the last three years making the game and we’re truly proud of the results.

'By giving players the chance to step into the shoes of either Kirk or Spock, two of the most well-known and loved characters in all of science fiction and adventure, we’re giving both gamers and Star Trek fans alike the chance to really explore the universe of this iconic franchise.'

It's set for release on April 26.
