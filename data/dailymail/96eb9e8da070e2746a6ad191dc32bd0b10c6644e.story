Without a trace: Gavin Smith, 57, a top 20th Century Fox executive was last seen last Tuesday driving away from a friend's house in LA

The Los Angeles sheriff's department has changed the status of the case of the missing 57-year-old father and film executive to a criminal homicide investigation.

Gavin Smith has been missing for one week and in spite of the shift in classification, there have been no clues released to the public to explain the change.

Smith, a married father of three, was reported missing on May 1 when he failed to show up for his job at Twentieth Century Fox.

Deadline reports that the search has intensified in recent days, but the spokesman for the sheriff's office said Tuesday that there has been no evidence found suggesting foul play.

Mr Smith's family says that, after returning to Los Angeles after a business trip, he had planned to spend the night at a friend's house.

'He was still watching TV downstairs when our friend went to bed, and he was going to be going up to bed shortly,' his wife Lisa told ABC News.

He was last seen driving away from the friend's home in Oak Park, north of Los Angeles at around 10pm last Tuesday evening in his black Mercedes sedan.

The first alarm bells went off when he failed to pick up his youngest son to drive him to school on Wednesday morning, and then never went to work or call the office that same day- two things that his wife said had never happened before in the past 21 years.

At the time, Mrs Smith was taking care of her mother who has cancer.

In an interview with ABC, Mrs Smith made an impassioned plea, hoping that he may be watching.

'We want you to come home, baby, we love you! Our world is not right without you! Be safe,' she said, fighting back tears.

In spite of the calls for tips from the public, there have been no significant finds.

Family members have since been unable to 'ping' the missing man's cellphone, which appears to be off and that his credit cards have not been used since Tuesday night.

'We're just doing our best to get as many people looking as possible,' his son Evan Smith, a forward for the University of Southern California basketball team, said in an interview.

'We're trying to find my dad. We need our father.'

Athleticism runs in the family, as Mr Smith gained notoriety in Los Angeles for being a part of UCLA's 1975 national championship basketball team under legendary coach John Wooden.

Evan said that friends first became concerned when his father failed to turn up at the film studio, a job he loves.

'My dad's a good guy, a very responsible man, and it all really took hold for us when he didn't show up for work,' he said.

Mr Smith has worked as a film distribution executive at the Calabasas-based company for nearly 18 years.

'We are extremely worried about our friend and colleague Gavin Smith and are actively doing what we can to assist the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department in their search for him,' Chris Aronson, vice president of domestic distribution for Fox, said in a statement.

Police have said that Gavin Smith, who stands tall at 6 foot 6 inches, was last seen wearing purple pants and black and gray shoes and has gray hair and has a goatee.

His sons take the fact that Mr Smith was wearing one of their pairs of purple workout pants as a sign that he was clearly not planning on meeting anyone.

'That's what he was wearing, you know? It doesn't sound like he was going anywhere,' Evan said.

The Sheriff's Department asks that anyone with information contact its Homicide Bureau, Missing Person's detail.
