This is the shocking moment a brutal carjacker dragged his victim along the road as he accelerated off in his BMW. 

The incident took place on the same street as another car jacking this month and police are investigating to see whether the crimes are linked. 

In the latest theft caught on CCTV, the culprit creeps up to the BMW before scurrying in to the driver's seat. 

As he accelerates away, the victim grabs desperately to the side of the car but is eventually dumped to the ground as the thief drives off.  

The man spots the parked BMW with its lights on and engine running outside a building suppliers 

Crouched over, he dashes towards the parked car as owner Justin Dean, 42, was locking up

He then entered the £26,000 BMW 3 Series M Sport while Mr Dean was away for only 30 seconds

As soon as he realised what had happened, he ran frantically to his car to try and stop the thief 

Running alongside the BMW, Mr Dean, a yard foreman, tried in vain to remove the culprit from the driver's seat

He remained gripped to the car as the thief stepped on the accelerated in Farnworth, Greater Manchester

But he was left dumped on the ground as the thief managed to shake him off the side of the vehicle

The thief then drove off leaving Mr Dean lying helplessly on the road - the car has not been recovered yet 

The incident happened just after 5.30pm on Wednesday outside building suppliers Cooper Clarke.

Yard foreman Justin Dean, 42, was locking up when his £26,000 BMW 3 Series M Sport was stolen.

Mr Dean, from Heywood in Rochdale, said: ' I had gone to lock the gate, I was away 30 seconds. Then I heard the car start and the lights on it flash on.

'I ran at the car and reached in. I had a grip of his arm and could see the fear in his eyes. Then he accelerated and I thought I can't keep hold.

'He appeared from an area of bushes across the road. I am convinced this is organised.'

It is the second carjacking to take place in Bloomfield Street, in the Farnworth area of Bolton, Greater Manchester this month.

In the first, Alan Shuttleworth, 59, was locking up at his premises at Starlight Bedrooms at 3.20pm on February 7, when a thief pounced. 

He had opened the security gate to the fenced compound and was about to drive his brown Skoda Yeti out when he went to check the shop's security shutters were locked properly.

He walked round to the front of the shop, momentarily leaving the yard gate open and the keys in the ignition.  

At that moment, the thief dashed round the corner got in to the driver's seat and sped away. 

In a last-ditch effort to save his car Mr Shuttleworth jumped on the bonnet as the thief drove directly at him. 

But the thief carried on regardless, stepping on the accelerator and eventually flinging him in to the road. The car then sped off out of sight with Mr Shuttleworth left lying in the road.

Alan Shuttleworth, who owns Starlight Bedrooms in Farnworth,  was locking up the premises on February 7

As he went to check the shop's security shutters, the thief dashed round the corner and into his Skoda Yeti

He got in to the car and accelerated out of the premises - with Mr Shuttleworth lying across the bonnet

But that did not deter the brazen thief and he sped off dumping the 59-year-old victim on to the road 

Mr Shuttleworth, stood outside his premises at Starlight Bedrooms, said: 'If I had not let go I think I could have been killed' 

The father-of-three bravely tried to halt the thief by jumping on to the bonnet of his Skoda Yeti 

The father-of-three from Astley in Greater Manchester said: 'I saw him getting into the car but I couldn't open the door so I jumped on the bonnet clinging on with my hands near the windscreen wipers.

'He drove down the ramp and onto the road. He was picking up speed and seemed to be weaving from side to side. I shouted at him "Get off my car".

'My legs were dangling over the wing of the car and I slid off. I landed on my metal knee - I have had a knee replacement operation.

'If I had not let go I think I could have been killed.' 

The thief is described as being white, of a thin build with gaunt features and with stubble. 

He was said to be about 5ft 8in tall, with short dark hair and wearing light blue jeans and a striped top with either blue, white or cream stripes. 

Police are now trying to establish if both crimes are linked. There has been no trace of either vehicle so far. 

Even though the method of theft was identical, they suspect two different carjackers may have been involved. 

Detectives are investigating if the carjackings are linked to organised crime gangs or are the work of individuals.

Detective Inspector Sarah May, said: 'We are investigating both thoroughly and keeping an entirely open mind as to any connection.

'I would encourage anyone who knows anything about either incident or the person responsible to call us and I would also ask people remain vigilant and let us know if either vehicle is spotted.'

Anyone with information should call police on 0161 856 5608 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
