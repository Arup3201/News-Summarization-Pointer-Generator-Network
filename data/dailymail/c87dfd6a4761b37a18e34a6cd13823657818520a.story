Real Madrid will trigger the latest saga in Luis Suarez's colourful career by bidding around £76million for the Liverpool striker.

The Anfield club, who will complete a deal for Emre Can from Bayer Leverkusen on Thursday, have been bracing themselves for this to begin and have given out clear signals that the player is not for sale.

The player himself has said that there is nothing to be concerned about because he is happy on Merseyside and the club is going in the right direction.

Waving goodbye? Real Madrid will try to trigger Luis Suarez's release clause at Liverpool with a £76m bid

However, even those close to the 27-year-old admit they can't say for sure what his final answer will be if Madrid keep increasing the mark on their bid.

Last year Liverpool showed admirable resolve to keep their man out of Arsenal's clutches and Brendan Rodgers admitted it was his greatest test as a manager to turn around what at one stage seemed an irretrievable stance from Suarez.

He did it with such aplomb that the Uruguayan hugged him in recognition after receiving his PFA Player of the Year award last month.

Yet Real Madrid are a greater proposition than Arsenal. The prospect of lining up with Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo in a stable of Galacticos is bound to appeal and they have the financial clout to make deals happen.

Madrid will also offer various makeweights with Fabio Coentrao, who has agreed a new contract, and Alvaro Morata already mooted.

Liverpool will counter that with them he can remain THE Galactico no matter who else they sign but it could be a fretful summer as the opening salvos are fired.

Thomas Muller and Louis van Gaal could be re-united soon as Bayern Munich grow agitated at their forward's demands for re-assurances.

Sportsmail reported Manchester United's interest in the Germany star last month and German newspaper Bild claims an official approach was made two weeks ago for the 24-year-old.

Van Gaal gave Muller his chance at Bayern when there were calls for new players to be brought in and that has not been forgotten by the player despite his affiliation with his boyhood club.

United have distanced themselves from links with Bayern and their priority remains to recruit in midfield and defence but with offers coming in for Javier Hernandez and Danny Welbeck, checking on Muller's price and availability makes good business sense.

United have been offered Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal by intermediaries but know Real Madrid are keen too on the highly-rated Chilean.

Sporting Lisbon, meanwhile, have rejected a £27m offer from Monaco for United target William Carvalho.

Norwich City are likely to be priced out of a move for Jordan Rhodes.

Blackburn do not want to sell and will demand a prohibitive £15million if pushed.

The Scotland striker scored 25 goals last season and has 52 in 87 games for Blackburn since his £8m move from Huddersfield Town.

The Yorkshire club also agreed a 25 per cent sell on clause so they will be keen to see if Blackburn can hold on to their prized asset.

Norwich are expecting offers from the likes of QPR and Crystal Palace for Gary Hooper who is keen to leave despite not handing in an official transfer request while Feyenoord are showing an interest in Ricky van Wolfswinkel. On Thursday they completed the £3m transfer of Lewis Grabban from Bournemouth.

Newcastle have held further talks over the possibility of signing Bafetimbi Gomis. The free agent striker who has left Lyon is holding out for big wages of around £100,000 a week and that will limit his options in this country.

QPR are weighing up an offer but have other targets too while Swansea are waiting on talks with FC Twente's Luc Castaignos and what bids come in for £19m-rated Wilfried Bony.

Gomis is also wanted by Galatasaray although they have expressed an interest in Mario Balotelli.

Newcastle have a deal in place for Tenerife's Ayoze Perez but are surprised at Leeds United's valuation of Ross McCormack, as reported in Sportsmail, and have touched base again about Ajax captain Siem de Jong.

There were a few well-known faces in the crowd at Holland versus Wales on Wednesday night. QPR manager Harry Redknapp, Hull boss Steve Bruce and Southampton sporting director Les Reed were all spotted in the Amsterdam crowd.

Crystal Palace midfielder Jonathan Williams was particularly impressive and did himself no harm amid illustrious company. The 20-year-old is attracting interest from Swansea but Hull and Southampton will also be taking note of what he could offer.

Manchester City midfield prospect Emyr Huws also did enough in his cameo appearance to have scouts talking.

Free agent Chris Basham has agreed a move to Sheffield United. The 25-year-old, who can play in 
defence or midfield, left Blackpool at the end of the season and has had
 interest from a number of Championship clubs but has been attracted to 
Nigel Clough's plans at the ambitious League One club. He is having a 
medical today.

Sheffield 
United have also made an approach for Halifax Town striker Lee Gregory 
but Millwall have bid around £100,000 also for the 25-year-old.

Chelsea are continuing to monitor Youri Tielemans at Anderlecht. They are not alone, however, as Manchester City, Tottenham, United and Arsenal have also watched his progress since he became Belgium's youngest Champions League debutant at the age of 16 years, four months and 25 days last October.

Now 17, Roma have also made enquiries about the midfielder as have Juventus, which may prompt some bidding for his services.

Sunderland
 have made enquiries for Argentinian striker Luciano Vietto. The skilful 
20-year-old forward has already been compared to the other diminutive 
strikers that have come out of Argentina but wants to make his own name 
by impressing in the Premier League.

Liverpool,
 Everton, West Brom and Leicester have already held tentative talks but 
the player is keen on working with Gus Poyet. Vietto would cost around 
£6million and has a dual Italian passport.
