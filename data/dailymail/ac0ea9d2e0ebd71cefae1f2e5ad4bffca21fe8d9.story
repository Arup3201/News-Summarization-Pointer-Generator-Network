The National Cockroach Project has shown that New York cockroaches can tell each other apart by where they were born and prefer to stick with other insects from their neighbourhood

They're traditional New Yorkers in that they prefer to stick to their own 
neighborhoods and have strong family ties, but any semblance to those whose homes they inhabit stop there - they are cockroaches.

Research by the National Cockroach 
project has shown that the household pests tell each other apart 
by their place of birth, and avoid those who aren't from the same 
'neighborhood'.

Accordingly, cockroaches native to the Upper East and Upper West Sides and Roosevelt Island can and do breed with one another, but they prefer to stay in their home areas with their own species.

Mark Stoeckle, a senior research associate, told National Geographic: 'The diversity was a big surprise to us and the fact that they're not just all mixed together - it's not a random assortment.

'So they must be staying close to home, and they have their own neighborhoods.'

Stoeckle joked that the insects were more similar to New Yorkers than most residents would like to admit, adding that they are 'immigrants', descending on America from all over the globe.

Researchers are trying to track the most common cockroaches in America and work out how they migrated across the country

'We know these are tropical species that 
are thought to have come from Africa, though there's no definite proof 
of that,' he said.

'They require a very warm, moist environment. And we've made a nice home for them in cities, because we have underground tunnels and sewers where they can live year-round.

'In the summer they come up above ground, and that's when we usually see them.

Sometimes 
called palmetto bug or waterbug, the American cockroach is the most common large roach in the 
U.S. and thought to have hitch-hiked to the continent from Africa inside
goods shipments.

They 
commonly inhabit warm, moist environments in man-made structures, 
including basements of large buildings, steam tunnels, and sewers.

The smaller cockroaches seen in homes and apartments are usually the German cockroach.

In
warm weather, the American variety may be seen roaming urban sidewalks 
at night particularly near large buildings, street drains, and manhole 
covers.

'But they've only been here as long as we've had an underground environment that's congenial for them.'

The National Cockroach Project is a research initiative by Rockefeller University which wants to find out the origins of the American cockroach, and understand how it has migrated across the country.

Using genetic barcoding the project tracks different species across the US and relies on samples sent in by citizen scientists.

These include schoolchildren who are asked to post cockroaches they find for examination - although the website emphasizes all samples must be dead first.

While the project collects specimens from all over the country, New Yorkers are the most likely to post the vermin in.

'We've gotten about 200 specimens, either mailed in or [hand-delivered]. Most are from the U.S., from New York City,' Stoeckle said.

'We've had better luck getting New Yorkers to pick up cockroaches than we've had elsewhere.'

One of the researchers joked that, just like real New Yorkers, the cockroaches are all immigrants coming to the city from overseas

Anyone wishing to kill a cockroach may
have their work cut out for them as the hardy species has been known to
survive a nuclear blast.

They
can also survive being decapitated from their bodies for a number of 
days, until the head starves to death due to its inability to eat.
