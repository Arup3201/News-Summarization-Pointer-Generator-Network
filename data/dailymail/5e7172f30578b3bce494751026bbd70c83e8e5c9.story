It was perhaps asking too much of this season’s FA Cup to give us another fourth-round shock after a weekend of upsets. There were to be no more League One heroics at Spotland to go with Bradford’s humbling of Chelsea.

They tried. Goodness knows Rochdale tried, and at times in the first half Stoke were certainly rocking.

But the Premier League side already had the cushion of a stunning early strike from Bojan Krkic, and they smoothed their passage with second-half goals from substitute Stephen Ireland and Victor Moses.

It did come at a cost, however, with Bojan limping off before half-time with a knee injury. Stoke’s inspirational playmaker left the ground on crutches and was driven away long before the game had finished.

The draw for the fifth round was made before kick-off, handing the winners of this tie a trip to Blackburn Rovers where both managers, Keith Hill and Mark Hughes, played earlier in their careers. Hughes also went on to become manager at Ewood Park, leading Blackburn to the semi-final in 2007.

Hill requested that news of the draw was not broadcast over the matchday tannoy beforehand to prevent his players from finding out as they prepared for their biggest match of the season.

Considering Manchester City’s capitulation to Middlesbrough after a few days in Abu Dhabi, Stoke fans must have wondered if it was a wise move their team going to Dubai ahead of the precarious visit to Spotland.

Hughes certainly wasn’t taking this tie lightly, however. Having seen his side go behind to Conference club Wrexham in the third round, he named a strong line-up with Bojan Krkic a surprise inclusion.

And the little Spaniard justified the decision as he took the wind out of Rochdale’s sails after just four minutes. Olly Lancashire’s clearance headed looped towards the edge of the box where Bojan was waiting, curiously unmarked.

He never took his eye off the ball for an instant and set him himself before despatching a magnificent left-foot volley into the top corner, giving goalkeeper Josh Lillis no chance whatsoever.

If the underdogs were stunned, they didn’t show it. They roared back at the Premier League side with the pace of 14-goal striker Matty Done causing Stoke all kinds of problems.

Jack Butland rushed out of his goal to save at the striker’s feet several times, and on the one occasion that Done got there first he rolled the ball agonisingly wide of the post with a clutch of Stoke defenders trailing in his wake seven minutes before half-time.

Done was inches away from connecting with wonderful right-wing cross from Joe Rafferty with only Butland to beat, and the Stoke keeper also came out to deny Ian Henderson after another pass had split Phil Bardsley and Ryan Shawcross.

Stoke were able to hang on until half-time but by then the inspirational Bojan was already back in the dressing-room with a yellow card and a sore knee to show for his troubles.

He was infuriated by a challenge on Victor Moses by Peter Vincenti in the 25th minute and let the Rochdale midfielder know how he felt. Play had continued, however, and Bojan ploughed into the back of Vincenti right under the nose of Martin Atkinson.

Both sets of players became involved in the flare-up and Atkinson booked Bojan and Vincenti while Moses received treatment on his ankle.

The Rochdale fans who had applauded Bojan’s strike immediately turned on him and jeered with delight when he went down in the home penalty box moments later.

There was no apparent challenge on the Stoke player but Hughes took no chances, sending on Stephen Ireland while Bojan was booed all the way as he walked around the perimeter of the pitch and down the tunnel.

Hughes also exchanged words with some of the Rochdale fans behind the dugouts during the half as he became increasingly animated over some of the decisions and, one would presume his team’s performance. They only managed three shots on target in the first half compared to Rochdale’s eight. 

The difference in class was reflected in the finishing, however, and Stoke scored a second goal seven minutes after the restart.

There appeared to be no imminent danger when Moses took possession on the left-hand side of the box, but he produced a sudden turn of pace to create the space for a cross and guided the ball in low for Ireland who had timed his run perfectly to score from close-range.

The former Manchester City midfielder has been something of a lucky mascot for Stoke in this season’s competition, having scored his only other two goals in the 3-1 win over Wrexham.

Moses added a wonderful third as he jinked his way into the box again and this time beat Lillis himself with a curling effort into the top corner.

Rhys Bennett got a consolation 12 minutes from time when he capitalised on Stoke’s failure to clear the danger and side-footed in from 10 yards but Jonathan Walters restored the visitor's three-goal lead with seconds remaining.

So no more shocks. But no shame at all for the underdogs either.
