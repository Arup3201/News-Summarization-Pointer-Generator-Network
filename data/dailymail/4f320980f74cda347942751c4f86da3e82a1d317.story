It may not be the most obvious toy for a child’s Christmas wish-list, but a cuddly monster designed to ‘eat’ their worries is apparently in high demand.

Amazon predicted the Sorgenfresser Worry Eater would be among the 20 most popular Christmas toys for 2014.

The idea behind the £20 toy is that children write down or draw a picture of something which has upset them and put it into the monster’s mouth, which is zipped shut, banishing their worries.

Popular gift: The idea behind the £20 Sorgenfresser Worry Eater is that children write down something which has upset them and put it into the monster’s mouth, which is zipped shut, banishing their worries

The award-winning toy was created in 2008 by German children’s TV animator Gerd Hahn and has become a huge success across Europe.

The first monster was called Saggo, however, there are now several others including Frula, Betti and Biff.

Flamm, an orange and white-striped monster with spiky hair, will be released in time for Christmas.

Rachel Wyatt, who works for the distributors, said: ‘There is a symbolic element to zipping away a worry and it disappearing. But if mum or dad finds a worry in a Sorgenfresser’s mouth it will help them to talk it through with the child.’

Amazon said the toys are already proving popular on children’s online Christmas ‘wishlists’.

The wishlists are created by parents so that family members, such as grandparents, can log on to buy the presents, in the same way as a wedding gift list.

Presents: The £59.99 interactive doll called My Friend Cayla is expected to be popular this festive season while the two princesses from the Disney film Frozen, which cost £34.99 each, are expected to top wishlists 

Amazon said other popular items included nostalgic toys from parents’ childhoods, including a marble racing game for £24.99, a revamped Barbie Malibu Dream House for £99.99, and a Chill Factor Slushy Maker for £12.99.

For parents willing to splash out, the £299 Hornby Digital Train Set has proved popular, as has the WowWee MiP Robot which can drive and dance on two wheels by responding to hand gestures.

There is also a £59.99 interactive doll called My Friend Cayla which can be synched to a tablet or smartphone, allowing it to search the internet for the answers to simple questions.

For those with smaller budgets, Amazon predicted bumper sales in a £29.99 Shimmer and Sparkle Knitting Loom, which enables children to knit hats, scarves, gloves, legwarmers and the £9.99 Pop Chef, which allows fruit and vegetables to be cut into fun shapes.

Following the huge success of the Disney film Frozen, about two princesses, a £34.99 Snow Glow Elsa doll, which comes with a light-up necklace, is also expected to top Christmas wishlists.
