Maxine Kumin, a prolific New England poet and U.S. poet laureate who won the Pulitzer Prize in 1973 for her work 'Up Country,' has died. She was 88.

The Bennett Funeral Home in Concord says Kumin, who wrote more than three dozen books of poetry, fiction, non-fiction and children's literature, died Thursday at her home in Warner after a year of failing health.

Kumin was an advocate for women writers, human and political justice and animal rights. Her final work, 'And Short the Season,' is scheduled to be released later this year.

Pulitzer-prize winning poet Maxine Kumin died at 88 on Thursday at her farm in Warner, NH

Born in Philadelphia, she graduated from Radcliffe College and lived for a while in Newton, Mass.

Kumin's family said her work was marked by a love and deep observation of nature and an unwavering commitment to the craft of writing.

Kumin was a close friend of the famous poet Anne Sexton, reports the Boston Globe.

The two of them had taken a writing workshop earlier in their careers and kept a private phone line between their houses. They would call each other when they had lines of poetry to share.

Anne Sexton commit suicide in 1974.

Kumin 'lived the longest of that generation' said Don Share of poetry magazine.

'In a way, I think the trajectory of her work was saner and healthier. She managed to keep going. And she not only survived, but I think her survival comes from being so tough,' he continued.

Kumin even cheated death once in her 70s when she was thrown from a carriage while getting ready for an equestrian contest.

The horse swerved to avoid trampling her but the 350 pound carriage broke her neck, 11 ribs, bruised her organs, and punctured a lung.

Despite her injuries, Kumin kept on writing through the pain.

She wrote a memoir detailing her struggle called, 'Inside the Halo and Beyond.'

Her work was often honored and she was given a Ruth Lily Poetry Prize in 1999 from the Poetry Foundation and was given the Harvard Arts Medal in 2005.

Kumin was honored to serve as consultant in poetry to the Library of Congress.

Kumin married engineer Victor Kumin in 1946 and has three children. She raised two daughters named Judith and Jane and also a son Daniel. In addition to her husband and children, Kumin leaves behind two grandchildren.
