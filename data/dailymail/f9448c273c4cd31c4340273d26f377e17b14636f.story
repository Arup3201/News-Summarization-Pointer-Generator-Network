Nigel Worthington doesn’t need a cursory glance towards his cousin, Brendan Rodgers, to realise how quickly fortunes can change.

The former Northern Ireland manager’s York side were just six points above the League Two relegation zone at the beginning of February but tonight embark on a play-off semi-final against big-spending Fleetwood Town.

It’s been such a turnaround over the last three months that the Minstermen are 17 games unbeaten - with 13 clean sheets to boot - and go in as the form side.

Turnaround: Worthington's York City have reached the playoffs in remarkable style

Not bad for a man whose remit when taking over at Bootham Crescent was to purely keep them afloat. Just three games now stand between them and the third tier.

‘Two weeks ago Brendan was on top of a mountain and everything was rosy, but it’s all changed,’ Worthington said.

‘They have almost gone from winning the league to losing it. I’m desperately disappointed for him.’ Worthington’s mum and Rodgers’ grandmother were sisters; the Liverpool manager has said that the cousin - 11 years his senior - was a major influence on his career.

‘We never seem to have the luxury of having a good night together,’ Worthington added.

‘The only time I see Brendan is on coaching courses because he’s a hell of a lot busier than I am because of Liverpool’s size.

‘You lose touch. You’re so focused on your own job. The amount of time football can take up in your life is amazing. I spend a lot of time at this club in League Two. God only knows what Brendan spends up there at the top of the Premier League.’

York’s rise cannot be understated, cannot be overlooked.

It’s ten years this week since they played their final game in Division Three - against Swansea no less - before dropping down to the Conference. Seasons in the doldrums, serious financial woe and play-off disappointment followed until eventual promotion in 2012. Worthington took over last March, kept them up and hasn’t looked back.

‘We want to see how far we can push ourselves,’ the 52-year-old said. ‘Whatever is earned by the club gets put back in. It’s in black and white. I appreciate that.

‘The chairman [Jason McGill] is very committed to making sure the club is a part of the community. That’s very important to the city of York. That’s close to his heart, and rightly so.’ Worthington earned 66 caps for his country and played in a World Cup, revealing that he turned down two opportunities at clubs higher up the pyramid before plumping for York.

He is self-aware and knows exactly what the drop from international management to England’s basement looks like.

Perceptions don’t bother him.

In the battle: York City's playoff dreams mean their season is still alive

‘If you’re a football person and enjoy the game you shouldn’t feel embarrassed by it,’ he said.

‘You sometimes have to bide your time. Everybody wants to be as high as they can but it’s got to be right for you. I loved my time as Northern Ireland manager and had some really good results in that time. People wanted change and you get on with it.

‘We were close to qualifying for tournaments. It’d be huge if they ever did it because, no disrespect, they don’t have enough players at the top level.

‘I’m back out on the grass and working for good people at York City. When you add those things up, I’m a very happy man.’ Worthington will be even more gratified if he can deliver what would be an unthinkable promotion - not least to add some smiles to family faces.
