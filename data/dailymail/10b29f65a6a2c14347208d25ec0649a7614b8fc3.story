Jenson Button’s future is uncertain after McLaren boss Ron Dennis said on Thursday he was monitoring other leading drivers who might become available.

Button, Britain’s 2009 world champion with Brawn, has been at McLaren since 2010 and, aged 34, is in the final year of his contract.

The winner of 15 grands prix, he is the most experienced driver in Formula One. He made his debut in 2000, and sits eighth in the championship with 68 points. 

Final lap? Jenson Button will consider retirement if he loses his place in McLaren's team

Kevin Magnussen, his Danish rookie team-mate, has scored only 37 but, at 21, is seen as a face of the future.

Dennis told the Formula One website that he was satisfied with his drivers, but added: ‘The fact that we’re keeping an eye on what a few other drivers are up to in no way contradicts that.

‘If opportunities arise, we’ll appraise them — we always have and we always will.’

Ferrari’s Fernando Alonso continues to be linked with McLaren even though he had an unhappy season at the team alongside Lewis Hamilton in 2007 and fell out with Dennis.

McLaren have not won a race since 2012 and failed to even get on the podium last year. But Honda are returning as McLaren’s engine partners next year and are said to be pushing for an ‘A List’ driver. 

Button acknowledged the uncertainty of his situation after Sunday’s Belgian Grand Prix, saying: ‘If I have to retire at the end of the season then so be it, but I feel I have so much more to give.’ 

Hamilton’s future with Mercedes is also unsettled.

Mercedes will now wait until this year’s championship is decided before continuing contract talks with the Englishman, who is locked in a bitter feud with team-mate Nico Rosberg.

Hamilton accused the German of deliberately driving into him in Belgium and Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff, who has already agreed a new deal with Rosberg, said: ‘Things are very intense. We are not going to talk to anybody else before having a very clear situation about how we can continue to work with Lewis.’
