It is the world's largest metropolis and home to more than 13million people.

Now a snapper has managed to capture Tokyo's vast sprawl in one incredible 360째 panoramic shot that now holds the title of second largest photograph ever taken.

Jeffrey Martin's 600,000 pixel-wide creation, shot from the top of the Tokyo Tower, reveals the Japanese capital in astonishing detail, allowing viewers to zoom in close enough to read the signs in the window of a restaurant or count the plant pots on an apartment balcony.

Detail: The 150-gigapixel 360째 panoramic photograph of Tokyo, taken from the top of the Tokyo Tower, is the second largest in the world

Mr Martin's previous panorama of London shot from the BT Tower is the world's biggest photograph.

The photographer, who is the founder of 360 Cities, used a single Canon 7D to capture the view, mounting the camera and a 400mm f/5.6L lens on top of a Clauss Rodeon VR Head ST robotic panorama head, according to petapixel.com.

With it he shot images for a total of six hours split over a two day period.

It took a further 12 weeks to achieve the finished result, which consists of 10,000 photos digitally stitched together using a 12-core Fujitsu Celsius R920 workstation.

If the photo was printed at a regular resolution, it would cover an area around 328ft wide and 164ft tall.

Viewers of the full-resolution version, from Mr Martin's vantage point 20 storeys up, can gaze at Tokyo's vast array of skyscrapers and buildings stretching as far as the eye can see.

But they can also zoom in closer to get a glimpse of people crossing the street or enjoying a meal in one of the city's restaurants.
