Bigamist: Garry Floodgate, 54, pleaded guilty to marrying his third wife in Las Vegas without divorcing his last

A man caught out getting married in Las Vegas by his wife when wedding photos appeared on Facebook has been jailed today for 20 weeks.

Plant driver Garry Floodgate's wife Rachel called the police when she found pictures of his other wedding at the Circus Circus hotel's chapel.

Mr Floodgate, 54, thought that when he wed Candian divorcee Sheila Siebert, 55, last June his divorce had come through.

He was in fact still legally married to his now ex-wife Rachel, 26.

She was contacted by Mrs Siebert, the third wife from Calgary, Canada, who left him when she discovered the truth.

Mr Floodgate, from Bletchley, Buckinghamshire pleaded guilty to committing bigamy on 5 June last year.

He told the court that he did not realise he was still married: 'I was just confused. I had lots of things going on in my head. '

He was sentenced today at Northampton magistrates court, but his lawyers have lodged an appeal.

At an earlier hearing prosecutor John Cavener said: 'The defendant formed a relationship with a Canadian national over the internet and the relationship became a serious one.

Caught out: Mr Floodgate has now been left by his third and second wives

'He went over and met the lady and after a very short space of time they decided to get married.

'Unfortunately he was separated and going through divorce proceedings, but was not divorced.'

Mr Floodgate has a 17-year-old daughter from his first marriage.

He was divorced when he met second wife Rachel, in 2003.

They married in 2004 and had two daughters, but separated in November 2010.

Mr Cavener said that a decree nisi was granted on 13 June 2012 - 8 days after the Vegas wedding.Â 

'It became clear to the third wife that the marriage was void. She is now attempting to get the US marriage annulled,' said the prosecutor.

Mr Floodgate told the court: 'I thought I was divorced. I made a mistake. I had no intention of breaking the law.'

He said he had received documents from the court which he believed showed he was divorced by the time he flew to Vegas.

Asked about his relationship with Sheila, he said: 'We haven't got one. It ended on 20 June when I flew back from Canada.'
