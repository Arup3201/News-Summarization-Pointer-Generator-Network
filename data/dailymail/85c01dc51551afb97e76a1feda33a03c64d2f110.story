An anonymous pair of artists have been working under the cover of darkness to brighten up the streets of London with gigantic works of street art.

The duo - who like street artist Banksy shun the limelight - create their huge murals on the walls of buildings around London for the public to enjoy, using only a ladder, spray paint and the light of the moon.

The finished pieces include a giant blue pigeon in London Fields, a large fox in Haringey and a super-size squirrel complete with a nut in Tottenham.

An anonymous pair of artists have been working under the cover of darkness to brighten up the streets of London with incredible works of art - including this giant blue pigeon in London Fields

Just like Banksy, the duo known as Boe and Irony remain anonymous, creating their artworks using spraypaint on the sides of buildings for the public to enjoy. This snarling fox appeared in Haringey

The duo, known only as Boe and Irony, have said they prefer to remain anonymous, shunning the notion of 'celebrity'.

They reportedly met when they both left a party early to go painting, and have worked together ever since.

In a recent interview with the Guardian 
they said that painting for the street is not like painting for a 
gallery where people 'come to hear what you say.'

They said street work was inflicted on an audience 'whether they want to see it or not'.

They added: 'So
you start off with something people can generally accept, like a fluffy
kitten, that’s your foot in the door, then you can start actually 
trying to say something with the piece.'

This enormous raven has also been etched on to the wall of an east London building. The pair create their huge murals using only a ladder, spray paint and the light of the moon

They have refused to say where they will 'strike yet' adding that that would ruin the surprise.

In May a giant Banksy, with an estimated value of £1million, was removed from the side of a crumbling Grade II listed building.

The giant rat, which was created by Britain's most famous street artist, had been eroding for years, with large parts having peeled off with the plaster or vanished on rotted wood.

A special restoration team was drafted in to remove the painting from the old Whitehorse pub in Liverpool's China town as part of plans to re-open the building.

Bristol-born Banksy daubed the huge rat wielding a machine gun on the Georgian building in Berry Street as part of Liverpool's Biennial art programme in 2004Banksy has since conquered the art world, selling his unique pieces for millions, and counts Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie amongst his fans.

Boe and Irony said the artist was partly responsible for the increased popularity in street art.

They added: 'Banksy’s financial success has made people feel more comfortable about street art. People are cool with anything once it’s been assigned a cash value.'
