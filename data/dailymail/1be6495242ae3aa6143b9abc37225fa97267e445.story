Space odyssey Gravity was the big winner at last night's Oscars.

The movie about a medical engineer and an astronaut stranded in space after an accident, starring George Clooney and Sandra Bullock, bagged seven awards during one of the most hotly contended events in years. 

But while the awards are normally the domain of the major Hollywood film studios, two small British visual effects teams emerged as the stars of the event.

Framestore brought the stunning visuals in the lost-in-space fantasy drama to life - creating everything you see on screen except the actors' faces, while the jaw-dropping 3D effects were the product of conversion company Prime Focus World.

Collecting one of the golden statuettes, the film's visual effects supervisor Tim Webber praised the crew behind the camera for their extraordinary work producing one of the most talked-about films of the year.

But it is testament to the skill of 
the visual effects experts who helped create the amazing film - produced almost entirely inside a cramped studio - that much 
of their work was invisible to the audience.

Stunning: Gravity, starring Sandra Bullock as Ryan Stone, won seven awards at the Oscars

Complicated: The team behind the visual effects had to created a convincing sense of zero gravity using Computer Graphics

Describing one of the most difficult scenes to capture, Mr Webber -
 who has worked on films including The Dark Knight and Avatar - detailed
 how painstaking attention had to be paid to every frame in order to 
maintain the sense of reality.

Gravity was the toast of Tinseltown after winning seven Oscars.

Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón was lauded for his vision which helped create a stunning movie.

But Oscar judges heaped praise upon the team behind the film's revolutionary special effects.

The film won:

'There’s the shot where the International
 Space Station is being destroyed, which is incredibly complicated to 
choreograph and to simulate the destruction, and Sandra’s action is very
 complicated in that, so that was very difficult,' he told The Telegraph.

The team pioneered Computer Graphics which involved imposing actors in a studio on to entire landscapes and backgrounds.

What set Gravity apart from other films which used computers were the hyper realistic backgrounds.

Whereas the 2009 sci-fi 3D epic Avatar was set in a fantasy landscape, 
Gravity had the difficulty of making the interior of the 
international space station as convincing as possible.

One
 of the techniques adopted was called previsual in which every camera 
angle and movement of the actor was planned in advance.

The
 painstaking process enabled the team to seamlessly impose the actors 
into an environment where objects, cameras and background appear to be 
moving.

Webber told The Telegraph:
 'We did replace bits of it with CG, because she was being held up by 
rigs, and rigs would cover bits of her, but on the whole it’s her body. 
And so that made that incredibly complicated to shoot to make it look as
 though she was floating.'

The use of 3D effects was also was also a hallmark of the movie.

A team from Prime Focus World spent six-months converting the film footage into stunning and convincing stereo or 3D images.

'Many of our early discussions about the stereo concerned the contrast in style between the environments inside and outside the capsule,' said Richard Baker, Senior Stereographer, Prime Focus World. 

Award-winners: Glenn Freemantle (R), winner for Best Sound Editing with Niv Adiri, Christopher Benstead, Chris Munro (L-R) winners for Sound Mixing, all for the film 'Gravity'

Painstaking: The finished film was the culmination of months of painstaking work by visual effects teams

Meticulous: The actors faces were imposed onto a computer generated background

'Part of the vision for the stereo was to create a contrast between the vast, unending feeling of space for the exterior shots and the claustrophobia, isolation and loneliness of the interior shots in the close confines of the capsule – something that I feel really comes across when you see the film.'

'Everyone with an interest in filmmaking is familiar with the long seamless shots that Alfonso and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki created for Children of Men,' said Matthew Bristowe.

'On Gravity, Alfonso and Emmanuel have gone one step further. The long, unbroken, floating camera shots work spectacularly well in space, and led to us producing the longest continuous shot that I believe has ever been converted – 15,531 frames, or 10mins 47 secs.

High-tech: Creating the stunning movie Gravity was only made possible with thanks to cutting edge computer technology

Gravity is about a medical engineer and an astronaut stranded in space after an accident

'But for us, this film was so much more than just the technical achievements, or solving the production challenges - Gravity is one of those movies that we’ll all look back on later in our careers and be extremely proud to have worked on.'

'There was a time, perhaps, when conversion was seen by some as an afterthought, tacked onto the end of the filmmaking process to sell more tickets,' added Richard Baker.

'Gravity is here to bury that thought once and for all. Gravity is unlike anything you have seen before. In terms of 3D, this film is awe-inspiring.

'In terms of filmmaking, it’s a quantum leap forward, creatively and technically. In terms of unifying the practical toolsets used to realize the storytelling vision, it’s unmatched. It was an absolute honor to be part of the team entrusted with delivering Alfonso’s extraordinary vision for Gravity.'

Gravity is available to own now on Blu-ray, DVD and in 3D.
