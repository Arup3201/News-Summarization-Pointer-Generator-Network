George Zimmerman's wife is asking that he pay for a permanent life insurance policy with her named as the beneficiary, according to a divorce petition made public Friday.

Shellie Zimmerman said in the petition that her husband should pay the premiums on the policy since he "has the financial ability to obtain such life insurance at reasonable rates. 'She also asked for custody of the couple's 2-year-old Rottweiler, Oso, and 8-year-old Leroy, a mixed-breed dog.' They have no children.

Shellie Zimmerman, 26, is seeking an equal distribution of their checking accounts, trusts, partnerships and any unknown assets, and asked that a judge prevent him from selling off any property. Among the unknown assets is any money George Zimmerman may get from a defamation lawsuit he has filed against NBC.

Invincible: Shellie Zimmerman says her husband feels invincible since he was acquitted of murder in Trayvon Martin's death

The couple, who have been married since November 2007, separated a month after Zimmerman was acquitted in July of any crime for fatally shooting 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in February 2012. The Zimmermans aren't living together as husband and wife, said the petition, which suggested Shellie may seek legal fees from her husband for the divorce.

'The marriage between the parties is irretrievably broken,' the petition said.

In an interview with ABC's Good Morning America that aired Friday, Zimmerman said her husband left her with "a bunch of pieces of broken glass" after the acquittal.

She said he only stayed in their house three or four nights since the trial ended and that they even tried counseling. But she moved out Aug. 13.

'I have a selfish husband and I think George is all about George,' she said.

Last week, Shellie Zimmerman pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor perjury charge for lying about the couple's finances during a bail hearing following her husband's arrest after Martin's shooting in Sanford, Fla.

George Zimmerman, 29, said he acted in self-defense when he killed Martin and the polarizing case opened up national discussions on self-defense laws and race. Martin was black. Zimmerman has a white father and Hispanic mother.

Support: Shellie Zimmerman says she supported her husband throughout his trial for killing Trayvon Martin

Shellie Zimmerman was sentenced to a year's probation and 100 hours of community service. Her husband did not attend the sentencing hearing in the Sanford courtroom.

'I stood by my husband through everything,' she told ABC, 'and I kind of feel like he left me with a bunch of pieces of broken glass that I'm supposed to now assemble and make a life.'

Shellie Zimmerman says her husband was verbally abusive toward her and that he has been making what she considers 'reckless decisions.' She didn't specify what those decisions were. "In my opinion, he feels more invincible" since his acquittal, she added.

She said the timing seems right to begin a new life.

'I have supported him for so long and neglected myself for too long,' Shellie Zimmerman said. 'And I feel like I'm finally starting to feel empowered again.'
