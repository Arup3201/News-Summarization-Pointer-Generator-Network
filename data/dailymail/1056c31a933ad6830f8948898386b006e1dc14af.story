Lutz Pfannenstiel is the only professional footballer to have ever played on six continents. He had several stories to share, from throwing a bag of excrement to having a penguin in his gloves and playing David Beckham.

Pfannenstiel told Sport Magazine: 'In Brazil [where Pfannenstiel played for Clube Atletico Hermann Aichinger], they're s***ing in a plastic bag and throwing it at the goalkeeper. There was lots of times where I got hit by a bag of sh*t on my shoe or sock.

'In America football culture is weird. You find stadiums that are kind of full, but there are families having a barbecue or picnic. I played a game [for Vancouver Whitecaps] against David Beckham, I saved another ball from another LA Galaxy player- a great save.

Pfannenstiel spent several years plying his trade in New Zealand and in his first six months he had a bizarre incident where a penguin found it's way into his gloves.

'There were 75,000 people and maybe 5,000 were clapping. Beckham takes the ball and makes a throw-in, the other 70,000 cheer-so you feel a bit stupid sometimes.'

'I put my goalkeeper gloves on. First hole: nothing. Second hole: nothing. Third hole: Oof! penguin in there, like [Pfannenstiel pulls the best impression of a sleep, startled penguin we'll ever see]. i took the penguin, drove home and kept it in my bathroom.
