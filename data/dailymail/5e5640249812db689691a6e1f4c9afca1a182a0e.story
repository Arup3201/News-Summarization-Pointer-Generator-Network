Will Brazil win the World Cup without Neymar?

Brazil awoke from a night celebrating their side's progress to the World Cup semi-finals to the bitter realistation that they will be without their best player Neymar for the rest of the tournament.

The World Cup poster boy has been ruled out for at least four weeks with a broken vertebrae following a tackle from Juan Camilo Zuniga during his side's 2-1 quarter-final victory over Colombia on Friday.

Brazilian sports paper Lance! featured the headline 'Play for him' in an attempt to encourage Brazil's players that they can still realise the dream of winning the World Cup in their home country without a player that has largely carried them thus far.

Play for him! Brazil sports newspapers react to losing their poster boy for the rest of the tournament

The dream is over? Neymar writhes in agony after breaking a vertebrae during Brazil's 2-1 win over Colombia

Inside the paper, journalist Mauro Betting remembers past great players including Hungary's Ferenc Puskas (1954) and Franco Baresi of Italy (1994), who were forced out of World Cups through injury - while examining the alternatives left to coach Luis Felipe Scolari.In Folha de Sao Paulo, 'Brazil reach the semi-final, but Neymar is out of the Cup' offers a bleak reminder to the country - although one of Brazil's most revered journalists Juca Kfouri, stayed positive about Brazil's World Cup hopes.

'It was Brazil's best performance of the World Cup...and things could get even better, even without Neymar, who will be missed, really missed. But Neymar is only one player, and he isn't Messi, much less Pelé. And without Pelé, we won the World Cup in 1962,' he wrote.

Villian: Colombia defender Juan Camilo Zuniga has been largely blamed for Neymar's injury

Elsewhere, Correio Brazilienese runs with the headline 'The pain that stopped our joy' accompanied by a picture of Neymar writhing on the ground in agony.And, Extra takes a more embittered angle with the headline 'Cowardice takes Neymar from the Cup'.

This anger was shared by many Brazilian journalists including legendary broadcaster Galvao Bueno from Brazil's biggest network Globo who said: 'It was malicious... a deliberate attack on football and art.'

Brazil's frustrations have largely been directed at Zuniga, the player responsible for the robust foul, and Spanish referee Carlos Velasco Carballo for failing to offer the 22-year-old more protection.

'I'm devastated that Neymar is out of the World Cup. It was a ridiculous foul that wasn't even punished. The only thing that was punished was talent. What a pity,' wrote journalist and TV presenter Fatima Bernardes.

Speaking on SpoTV, Fabio Cannavaro agreed that Zuniga was to blame. 'I'm a little more cynical,' he said. 'Neymar isn't transparent. He came from behind with his knee up.'However, Brazil's 1970 World Cup winner Carlos Alberto Torres had his doubts over Colombian defender Zuniga's intent. 'For me, it was an accident. He tried to break up the play. It's the kind of challenge you see all the time,' he said.Meanwhile, Band TV's firebrand sports presenter, Milton Neves raged: 'This Spanish referee was like the Spanish team at this World Cup: a joke'.
