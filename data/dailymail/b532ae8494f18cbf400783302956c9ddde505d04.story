This is the moment an unsuspecting phone user had his mobile snatched in just two seconds by a hooded cyclist.

The footage, captured in North London, was revealed as new figures showed thefts of mobile phones in London have soared by 64 per cent over the past three years with 300 mobiles now being stolen every day.

Many of the thieves are youths on bikes or mopeds but others, often thefts from crowded bars, are organised by mainly Eastern European crime gangs. Nearly 10,000 phones were stolen just last month.

Speedy grab: In just a few seconds a man on a bike zooms past him snatching his phone out of his hands

In the footage, the innocent victim is captured casually standing on the pavement texting a friend in one hand.

Moments later a hooded cyclist suddenly streaks past at high speed and snatches the mobile from his hand.

He is left stunned and opens his arms in frustration and anger as he realises what has happened.

The whole incident, which took place on Essex Road in Islington in June, unfolds in a matter of seconds.

New
 figures show a total of 9,751 mobiles were stolen in thefts or 
robberies last month - a 64 per cent rise on the number stolen in the 
capital in December three years ago.

In December 2009 there were 5,915 offences and in December 2010, there were 8,078 offences committed.

Today Scotland Yard launched an advertising campaign to warn Londoners of the risks of phone and jewellery snatches.

One advert showing a mobile phone reads: 'I
 see easy cash so I run up to him and grab it from his hand', 
highlighting how the thieves are often opportunistic rather than devious
 planners.'

Police say they are dealing with a 20
 per cent increase in the number of snatches and thefts of mobile phones
 in London - around half of all phones stolen are Apple iPhones.

And police say the phone thefts are driving a surge in theft rates across the capital.

'The impact of losing a phone is not just its market value but it can 
have a huge emotional impact on people's lives. Often people's whole 
lives are contained on their phone with contacts and photographs. These 
can't always be replaced.'

He added: 'Just being conscious of where you are and being careful about
 when you display your valuables can help you avoid being targeted. '

Police say the vast majority of 38,018 thefts in the last nine months were of mobile phones.

The
 Met's analysis of the figures show victims of robbery are more likely 
to be male, whereas young professional females are more prone to theft.

The most common profile for all victims is a young professional likely to be aged between 20 and 20, out and about in the capital on a night out, in pubs and clubs or other public places.

Police admit mobile phone companies are unlikely to take serious action when they can benefit from uninsured phones being stolen and having to be paid to replace.

Undercover officers are now targeting hotspots where mobiles are being 
stolen, it has been reported.

Smart phones are either being sold in batches abroad or are advertised in the UK on internet sites such as eBay or Gumtree.

Police on patrol in London are arming themselves with iPads or iPhones so they can track the signals of stolen phones with satellite tracking apps.
