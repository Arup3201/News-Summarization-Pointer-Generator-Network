David Gold hurled a grenade in the direction of Daniel Levy, suggesting that the Tottenham Hotspur chairman has a grudge against West Ham which caused talks over an Emmanuel Adebayor transfer to break down.

‘No matter how hard you try, there are people out there that you just can't do business with,’ he wrote on Twitter, a barb seemingly directed at Levy.

The hostility between the two teams is no secret with Levy falling out with the East London club on several occasions, most notably when they were both bidding to move into the Olympic Stadium.

Emmanuel Adebayor deadline day move to West Ham collapsed after talks stalled

West Ham had been keen to take Adebayor to Upton Park

West Ham co-Chairman Gold took to Twitter to document his club’s bid to sign Spurs striker Adebayor in the closing hours of the January transfer window. ‘Don’t go to bed,’ he urged, suggesting a deal was imminent.

However he later took to the social network to apologise for giving supporters false hope. ‘Sorry for keeping you up late,’ he wrote, ‘but at the last moment the main deal collapsed and the rest folded like a pack of cards.

‘I'd like to thank David Sullivan and Sam (Allardyce, manager) for their efforts to secure new players during this window. However no matter how hard you tried there are people out there that you just can't do business with.’

Spurs are now left with a player in the dressing room they desperately wanted to get rid of until the summer, at least. Adebayor, 30, is paid £100,000 a week. He refused to move away from London and Levy was willing to subsidise his wages if he moved to QPR, who offered to pay £60,000-a-week towards his pay packet and Crystal Palace, who offered to contribute £70,000-a-week.

Spurs chairman Daniel Levy was unwilling to subsidies Adebayor's wages if he moved to West Ham 

Adebayor preferred a move to West Ham but Levy would not budge, refusing to contribute any of his wages if he moved to Upton Park. In some ways, this could be seen as a compliment to West Ham, a club Levy clearly deems a threat to Spurs’ top four aspirations. There are just six points separating them in the Premier League table and Essex born Levy, 52, didn’t want to be left rueing the sale of Adebayor. But Gold seemed to take it somewhat personally.

Jeramin Defoe played for West Ham before leaving in 2004 to join Tottenham 

Spurs have bought some of West Ham’s best players in recent years, including Jermain Defoe and Michael Carrick.

But there is no love lost between Levy and West Ham’s vice-chairman Karren Brady, either.

The pair made their war of words public in 2011 when they were both bidding to take over the Olympic Stadium, which was later sold to West Ham. In a statement, Levy branded Brady a ‘scaremonger’ and accused her of being ‘irresponsible’ after she said his club’s plans to tear down the stadium in Stratford amounted to ‘corporate crime’.

Michael Carrick was another player who started at West Ham and was later signed by Spurs

Brady had accused Levy of making rash plans to redevelop the site. ‘It’s a corporate crime to spend £500million on a stadium and, just four weeks after the Games have finished, bring the bulldozers in. The Olympic Stadium was built on a promise, made in the Queen’s name, to have a legacy for athletics,’ she said.

Levy quickly hit back at the Apprentice star and prominent businesswoman. ‘Accusations that we would ‘demolish’ £500million of stadium are hugely inaccurate and highly irresponsible and I want to be very clear on this issue.

West Ham and Spurs had been at war over the Olympic Stadium in the past

‘It is also important to remember that two thirds of the Olympic Stadium, under the original legacy plan, was to be dismantled - it was not designed to be a permanent structure. Recent scaremongering conveniently forgets this fact.’

Whatever the reason for the breakdown in the Adebayor transfer, this latest bit of mudslinging will do nothing to improve the relationship between the two clubs.
