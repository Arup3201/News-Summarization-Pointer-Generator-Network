Support for the UK Independence Party has reached a record 19 per cent, while both Labour and Conservatives are losing ground, it has emerged.

Despite a week of controversy, in which UKIP leader Nigel Farage visited Edinburgh and was locked in a pub by angry protestors, public backing for the party has never been higher.

The UK Independence Party leader said the left-wing extremists who trapped him were the ‘ugly face of Scottish nationalism’ pursuing an anti-English agenda.

However, poll results do not reflect the crowds who just this week shouted 'racist scumbag' and 'scum' at the leader, who has begun to pose a real threat as a major political party.

Farage has no need to hold recruitment signs (pic right) as his party enjoys an unprecedented surge in support. He appeared on last Sunday's Andrew Marr in a discussion about an EU referendum and his party's supporters

Farage's popularity was not mirrored in Edinburgh, where he said 'Scottish nationalists are Fascist scum'

According to research, support for 
Labour was down three points to 35 per cent, the Conservatives were down
 one to 29 per cent and the Liberal Democrats were unchanged on 8 per 
cent.

The
 party - which has had a gaffe-ridden few weeks - has managed to appeal 
to the public so much so that there has been a four per cent jump in 
support in the last month.

The ComRes poll for the Sunday Mirror and Independent on Sunday gives Ukip the highest share recorded by any pollster.

Since
 their shock win in an Eastleigh-by-election in February, UKIP 
representatives have produced a series of embarrassing moments for the 
party.

UKIP Councillor Eric Kitson, 59, resigned after posting racist cartoons and messages on Facebook.

One
 included a picture of a nuclear weapon exploding emblazoned with the 
message: 'Some cancers need to be treated with radiation, Islam is one 
of them'.

He also shared an
 image of a Muslim being roasted over a pile of burning Korans, as well 
as several anti-Semitic outbursts linking the Rothschild banking dynasty
 to Adolf Hitler.

In one comment he said in reference to Muslim women: 'Hang um all first then ask questions later.'

The
 councillor from Stourport, Worcestershire, apologised to residents and 
party colleagues for his 'stupid' actions but he denied being racist.

Alex
 Wood, a UKIP candidate for Blackmore Vale in Somerset, was suspended 
from the party last month after being caught on camera apparently making
 a Nazi salute, bringing further scandal to the party.

Comments saying that Africans ‘lived in mud huts’ and ‘kill each other’ also appeared under his name on the Facebook page.

It
 also emerged that John Sullivan, a UKIP candidate in Gloucestershire, 
is alleged to have made the homophobic comments on Facebook.

He is said to have claimed that regular exercise 'prevents' children from 'becoming' gay.

He
 also suggested the Victorian method of physical exercise 'released 
tension and thus avoided homosexuality', but it was unclear whether 
these are Mr Sullivan's views or whether he was just talking about 
Victorian attitudes to sport and homosexuality.

Results show that the UKIP leader's image is appealing to the public. Tory council leader Keith Mitchell said Mr Farage 'uses soundbites that appeal to Conservatives'

Labour leader Ed Miliband (left) and PM David Cameron have had seen their support dwindle at the hands of UKIP

The threat that UKIP now poses was acknowledged by Tory council leader Keith Mitchell, who said David Cameron needs to behave more like Nigel Farage to reverse Ukip's rise.

Mr Mitchell accounted for the huge rise in popularity for the Right-wing party, who are believed to be chipping away at the Tory's traditional supporters.

He said: ‘I am afraid the UKIP leader has a style and a manner of speaking that connects with ordinary mortals much better than professional politicians.’

‘He is unafraid to be filmed with a pint of beer and a cigarette in his hand when all of our media training tells us to eschew either image.

‘He also uses soundbites that appeal to Conservatives.’

His warning came as figures revealed 
UKIP enjoyed a 51 per cent surge in members during the past 12 months, 
with many of them defecting from the Conservative Party.

According
 to the study 46% of Britons would vote to leave the European Union in a
 referendum now, compared with 24% who would stay in.

With
 the issue of an EU referendum as the current hot topic, strategists are
 blaming Labour’s own lack of clarity on Europe on the public's 
disillusionment with the leadership.

Privately, Labour insiders are warning of a ‘crisis of legitimacy’ if the party only secures a 34 per cent share of the vote at the next general election.

But if some powers were returned to the UK from Brussels 43% would vote to remain in the EU, with just 24% determined to see Britain leave.

The poll found just 26% said David Cameron was a good Prime Minister, a record low in ComRes studies, while 31% believed Ed Miliband was performing well as Labour leader, a new high.

The survey revealed that 57% of voters believed Mr Cameron's party was more divided over Europe than it was under Sir John Major, with 14% disagreeing.

But there was some comfort for the Prime Minister, with 49% of voters saying the offer of a European referendum would be important to them at the next general election, with 27% disagreeing.

And 32% believed Mr Cameron would make the best prime minister of the party leaders, with 24% opting for Mr Miliband.

ComRes interviewed 2,017 British adults online on May 15/16.
