Scientists at Europe's CERN
research centre have had to postpone the imminent relaunch of
their refitted 'Big Bang' machine, the Large Hadron Collider,
because of a short-circuit in the wiring of one of the vital
magnets.

'Current indications suggest a delay of between a few days
and several weeks,' a statement from the world's leading
particle physics research centre said on Tuesday.

Engineers had been expected to start on Wednesday pumping
proton beams in opposite directions all the way round the two
27-km (17-mile) underground tubes in the LHC, closed down for
the past two years for a refit.

The LHC (large hadron collider) in its tunnel at CERN (European particle physics laboratory) near Geneva, Switzerland.   After a two-year shutdown and upgrade, it is about to ramp up for its second three-year run.

When physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars, they are confronted with a mystery.

If they only take visible matter into account, their equations simply don't add up; the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces. There is something missing.

From this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light but does, as a whole, interact by means of the gravitational force.

Called 'dark matter', this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the matter in the known universe. 

That would have been the prelude to the start of particle
collisions in late May at twice the power of those in the LHC's
first run from 2010-2013.

The smashing-together of particles inside the LHC is
designed to mimic conditions just after the Big Bang at the dawn
of the universe. In a breakthrough in 2012, CERN scientists
announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle, a basic
building block of the universe, which appeared to be the boson
imagined and named half a century earlier by theoretical
physicist Peter Higgs.

Hopes for the second run lie in breaking out of what it
known as the Standard Model of how the universe works at the
level of elementary particles, and into 'New Physics.'

That includes searching for the dark matter that makes up
about 96 percent of the stuff of the universe but can only be
detected by its influence on visible matter around it.

CERN scientists expressed disappointment at the last-minute 
problem, in just one of the underground machine's eight sectors,
which have been rewired and checked thoroughly during the
closedown. 

But the research centre's director general, Rolf
Heuer, played down its significance.

'All the signs are good for a great run 2,' he said in a
statement. 'In the grand scheme of things, a few weeks delay in
humankind's quest to understand our universe is little more than
the blink of an eye.'

Scientists and engineers at CERN, mindful of a serious
leakage in 2008 which caused a delay of two years in the
start-up for the first LHC run, have long insisted that there
can be no rushing into full operations.

Frederick Bordry, director for accelerators, said it could
take time to resolve what he described as an intermittent
short-circuit because it was in a cold section of the machine,
meaning that part would probably have to be warmed up.

It would then have to be recooled. 

'So what would have taken
hours in a warm machine could end up taking us weeks,' he added.

Previously a Higgs particle has been created in an LHC detector and has then disintegrated into four muons (the four red lines). According to Dr Christoffer Petersson's model the Higgs particle can also disintegrate into a photon and particles of dark matter

Scientists at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, or CERN, say if nature cooperates, the more powerful beam crashes will give them a peek into the unseen dark universe.

Beams should start running through the giant machine later this month, with the first high energy crashes probably coming in May,  accelerator director Frederick Bordry said in a Thursday news conference in Geneva. A test beam ran through the collider last weekend, he said.

Scientists hope to see all sorts of new physics, including a first ever glimpse of dark matter, one of the chief focuses of the experiment.

'I want to see the first light in the dark universe,' CERN General Director Rolf Heuer said. 

'If I see that, then nature is kind to me.'

Dark matter — and its cousin, dark energy — make up most of the universe, yet scientists haven't been able to see them yet, so researchers are looking for them in high-energy crashes, in orbit on a special experiment on the international space station, and in a deep underground mine.

'What we know about dark matter is that it exists and then very little after that,' MIT professor Michael Williams said at a science conference in February.

CERN spent about $150 million to upgrade during its down time, opening the massive machine every 20 meters (66 feet), checking magnets, improving connections.

'It's nearly a new machine,' Heuer said. 

'It has the power which can melt 500 kilos (1100 pounds) of copper. Each beam. Two beams together, one ton of copper.' 

Professor Tara Shears, who leads the University of Liverpool LHCb group, said: 'We have unfinished business with understanding the universe.

'We want to see what the new data shows us about antimatter, and why there's so little in the universe. We want to chase the hints we've seen in previous measurements, whose behaviour didn't quite match our expectations, in case these hints turn into discoveries.

'We've spent the shut-down readying and improving the LHCb detectors so that we can explore this new data with precision.'

Dr Victoria Martin, from Edinburgh University, a member of the Atlas team, said: 'Using data from LHC Run One we discovered the Higgs boson particle. 

However only a limited number of Higgs particles were produced and it has not yet been possible to test every prediction made by Peter Higgs and others.

'The higher energy and more frequent proton collisions in Run Two will allow us to investigate the Higgs particle in much more detail.

CERN, the world's largest particle physics laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland.

'Higher energy may also allow the mysterious 'dark matter' observed in galaxies to be made and studied in the lab for the first time.'

On December 9 the magnets on one section of the LHC ring were successfully powered to the level needed for a single particle beam to reach 6.5 TeV.

The goal this year will be to run two beams of proton particles in opposite directions to produce 13 TeV collisions.
