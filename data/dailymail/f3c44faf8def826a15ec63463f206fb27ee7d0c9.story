The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are known for doing things their own way – and their forthcoming tour to Australia and New Zealand looks set to follow that trend.

William and Kate are planning to take Prince George with them when they head down under in April, but that will not be the only break with Royal tradition.

The Mail on Sunday has been told that the couple plan to fly with their son, who will be nine months old, breaching protocol about direct heirs in line to the throne flying together.

While a spokesman said the couple will make a final decision ‘closer to the time,’ sources say the Duke and Duchess intend to fly as a family.

The budget-conscious Cambridges are also keen to keep costs down.

An aide told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It’s a long way to fly, and there’s a cost implication if they travel separately.

'There’s no suggestion of them taking separate flights.’

Previous generations of the Royal Family, including the Queen, carried out tours without their children who were left behind with governesses.

The Cambridges will be overseas for almost a month. They will visit New Zealand  first for about ten days before spending a similar length of time in Australia.

The Mail on Sunday has been told that despite reports that Kate’s mother Carole Middleton has been asked to join the Royal party as a nanny, she will not be on the trip.
