Supermarket workers had a huge shock when they spotted a live scorpion inside a pack of bananas.

The 3in-long venomous creature travelled more than 5,000 miles from Costa Rica to a village shop in Cornwall by stowing away among the fruit.

Angela Parren, a sales assistant at Nisa Phoenix Stores in St Stephen-in-Brannel, spotted something moving as she restocked shelves. As she lent in for a closer look, the scorpion scuttled into view.

Alive: Zookeepers soon identified the creature as a juvenile black edged scorpion from South America

The 51-year-old called for help and co-workers moved the pack to a store room before calling police and the RSPCA. They were urged to contact nearby Newquay Zoo who offered to give it a new home.

Zookeepers soon identified the arachnid as a juvenile black-edged scorpion, known as centruroides limbatus. They are from South America - native to Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama and Costa Rica.

The species is not considered a major threat to humans but experts say a sting can still be extremely painful and in rare cases can leave people needing hospital treatment.

Les Howell, owner of Nisa Phoenix Stores, said: ‘We didn't know what to do with it. It didn't seem right to kill it, so we phoned our wholesaler for advice.

Centruroides limbatus, also known as black-edged scorpions, are often found in crevices near the ground.

They are known to inhabit Honduras and Nicaragua, but are most commonly found in Costa Rica.

The scorpions are known to frequent human dwellings with plenty of food and shelter.

Experts say that although they are not considered hugely dangerous to humans, they are venomous and a sting would be painful.

The species were first recorded by British zoologist Reginald Innes Pocock in 1898.

‘They suggested we phone the police, who suggested the RSPCA, who suggested DEFRA (the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs), who were closed for the Bank Holiday.

‘So we phoned Newquay Zoo and spoke to Gareth O'Dare, who is the Tropical House keeper.

'He suggested we take it out to the zoo, which we did after putting the whole bag of bananas inside a secure plastic box.

‘He told us that it was a juvenile black-edged scorpion which is native to Costa Rica where the bananas came from.

'Although a sting from its tail won't kill humans, it will still pack a punch.’

St Stephen-in-Brannel is six miles west of St Austell, with a population of more than 5,000.

Last month a family was forced to flee their home and have it fumigated after finding hundreds of potentially deadly spiders - in a bunch of bananas.

Shocked father Jamie Roberts, 31, of Hednesford, Staffordshire, spotted white patches covering pieces of the fruit from a OneStop shop after he put them in a bowl - but assumed this was mould.

However, upon closer inspection, he realised the fruit was infested with a spider nest - and immediately rang pest controllers who advised his family to leave their home immediately.

OneStop said that the type of spider had not yet been identified - and a sample of the arachnid had been sent to Natural History Museum experts for tests. It is not clear if these have been completed.

A 29-year-old housewife found spiders on her Sainbsury’s bananas - suspected to be Brazilian wandering spiders, one of the world’s most venomous types, whose bite can kill within two hours.

Consi Taylor and her husband Richard, 37, of Hampton, south-west London, had to spend three nights in a hotel last autumn with their children while their house was fumigated and deep-cleaned.

She had taken the fruit from a £1 bunch of Colombian Fair Trade bananas bought in a Sainsbury’s, and eaten about half when she noticed the 0.1in-long dots that resembled mould or bruising.

Sainsbury’s gave Mrs Taylor a £10 voucher when she returned the fruit. The store said it had ‘rigorous controls on imported products at all stages, which is why this is so rare’.

Last June, a 42-year-old shopper picked up a bunch of supermarket bananas from his local Lidl and found a large tarantula hanging off.

Mark Drinkwater said he was left with his 'heart beating through his chest' after discovering the spider, which he claimed was the size of his hand.

The tarantula, thought to have come with the imported bananas from Colombia, was caught by shop staff in a box and put in a freezer at the back of the store in Sydenham, south-east London.

And in 2008, a branch of Tesco in Chatham, Kent was forced to close after a terrified worker spotted a highly-venomous Brazilian Wandering Spider on a banana.
