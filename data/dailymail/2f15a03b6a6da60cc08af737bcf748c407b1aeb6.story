Thomas Vermaelen goes under the knife on Tuesday in Finland and the former Arsenal defender is not the only one whose career could depend on the operation’s success.

Barcelona’s sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta set himself up for a fall when he signed the Belgian international despite his terrible luck with injuries in the previous two years. 

He set himself up again when he said on the day of his presentation that the player was ready to perform immediately and that he had no concerns over his fitness.

And, not having learned from the previous two instances, he has now said he should be available for the semi-final stage of the Champions League.

Barcelona are so convinced the player will recover before the end of the season they are not even attempting to use a Spanish League rule that allows them to sign a replacement if the player is to miss the rest of the campaign in its entirety.

Former Barcelona and Spain keeper Zubizarreta is one of football’s nice guys with none of the arrogant airs that others might allow themselves were they occupying the position of sporting director at one of the biggest clubs in the world.

But as sporting director of one of the biggest clubs in the world he lives or dies by such declarations and more importantly by his signings.

Vermaelen is, for many, one transfer market mistake too many – the drop that overflows the glass, as they say in Spanish.

Almost since the day he replaced Txiki Begiristain as the man signing the players at the Camp Nou in 2010, a new central defender has been the priority but season after season Barcelona have failed to bring in the right man.

This summer the club failed to land PSG’s young Brazilian Marquinhos and overlooked a host of La Liga based options such as Real Sociedad’s Iñigo Martinez, Villarreal’s Mateo Musacchio, Espanyol’s Hector Moreno or Athletic Bilbao’s Aymeric Laporte. 

Instead went for Valencia’s 31-year-old Jeremy Mathieu and Arsenal’s Vermaelen. The later is yet to play a single minute and the former has played well but will never play well enough to justify his £16million price tag given his age.

Not all of Barca’s errors in the transfer market are his. Many can be traced back to a cash shortage stemming form former president Sandro Rosell’s obsession with signing Neymar who when all add-on payments were totted up left them with little change from £80m.

But his fingerprints are on the signing of Brazilian full-back Douglas who has started only one game; the signing two seasons ago of Alex Song with the promise that he could also play as a centre-back; and most recently missing out on Mallorca’s 18-year-old midfielder Marco Asensio, who he seemed to have sealed but who looks like ultimately being signed by rivals Real Madrid.

All that might be forgotten if Vermaelen returns with two outstanding semi-final performances in the Champions League but Barcelona supporters have long since stopped sharing their sporting director’s optimism.
