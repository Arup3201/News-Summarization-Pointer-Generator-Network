You wouldn't have to wait too long to be served and excessive noise from other diners wouldn't be a problem - but you might need to book well in advance.

The world's smallest restaurant is perfect for the couple who like to dine out but eat in private - it only seats two people.

Nestled in the village of Vacone, central Italy, the Solo Per Due restaurant has just enough space for one table for two.

Tiny: Diners have to email well in advance to get a table at the aptly named restaurant in Vacone

Apt: The restaurant's name literally translates as 'Just For Two'

Guests arrive at the aptly named restaurant - Solo Per Due means 'just for two' - along a candlelit driveway and are greeted by owner Remo Di Claudio who takes them to their table for an exclusive dining experience.

The restaurant's waiter allows diners to eat undisturbed but is literally at guests' beck and call and can be summoned with the ring of a silver bell.

But such an exclusive culinary experience will set you and your partner back - the restaurant has a set price of 250 Euro per person, which doesn't include fine wine or champagne.

The tiny restaurant's specialties include homemade extra virgin olive oil, which it also sells for 40 Euros a bottle, sheep's cheese, a wide variety of wild mushrooms, wild fruits, homemade pasta and bread and local sweets and cakes.

Beautiful: Diners at the restaurant walk up a candlelit path to the venue's door

Romantic: Even the food ensures a romantic experience - one of the restaurant's desserts, tiramisu, is adorned with a chocolate heart

The decor is traditional, with chandeliers, candles and an open fire helping to set the romantic tone in the building, which dates back to the 19th Century.

At the end of the evening loved-up guests can write about their experience in a 'Memory Book' which is full of messages of past diners who have gushed over their magical evening.

The restaurant, which is open for lunch and dinner,Â  has just under 1,500 people passing through its doors a year.

Owner Mr Di Claudio said: 'We have only one table and we take just two people at a time, so there are no queues, no turns, and no waiting.

All our attention is dedicated to the two people who have booked and we guarantee to give them an extra special dining experience.'
