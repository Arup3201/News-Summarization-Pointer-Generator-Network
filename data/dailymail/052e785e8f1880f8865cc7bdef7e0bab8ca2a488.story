The State Department Office of Inspector General is investigating an internal review board which largely cleared then-secretary of State Hillary Clinton and other high-ranking officials of wrongdoing in connection with the 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya.

The assault on the diplomatic compound left U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three others dead. But the White House has relied on the pronouncements of the Accountability Review Board, whose credibility is now being challenged for allegedly failing to interview key witnesses who specifically requested to be heard.

Former U.S. Ambassador to the United 
Nations Thomas Pickering and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff Admiral Mike Mullen co-chaired the blue-ribbon panel.

Terrorists attacked the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya on Sept. 11, 2012, leaving a burned-out shell and four dead bodies. One was U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens, who had requested more security forces but got no help from the State Department

It blamed the Benghazi catastrophe on 'systematic failures and leadership and management deficiencies at senior levels' inside the State Department, but said nothing about responsibility that might be shared by Clinton and President Obama.

The report also concluded that despite Ambassador Stevens' repeated requests for more security forces at diplomatic installations in Libya, no military resources were close enough to Benghazi to intervene during the Sept. 11, 2012 attack.

But accounts published in October indicate that at least one Navy SEAL team that was about a mile away from the consulate was told by superiors to 'stand down' during the raid instead of rushing to the aid of its employees. Fox News has also reported that Delta Force special operators were told to wait before approaching Benghazi.

The CIA has denied those reports, insisting that no such requests were turned down.

Followers of the Ansar al-Shariah Brigades burned the U.S. flag in Benghazi, Libya, three days after the raid on the U.S> consulate there. 'Obama, Obama,' they chanted, 'we are all Osama'

Blood stains at the main gate of the consulate were believed to be from one of the American staff members after militant terrorists attacked the outpost with mortars and rocket-propelled grenades

Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama spoke at Andrews Air Force Base three days after the assault when the remains of four victims were returned to the United States. At the time, the administration was holding to the line that protesters upset by a blasphemous American movie overwhelmed the Benghazi compound - an account later proved false

Clinton and other officials declined to answer questions about Benghazi from Congress until the report was completed. Afterward, the White House and others leaned heavily on the report to claim Clinton was not to blame.

Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio, however, has said that Clinton will have to fully answer for her role in the debacle if she seeks the Democratic nomination in the 2016 presidential election.

'I think that ultimately, if Secretary Clinton runs for office in the future,' Rubio says in an upcoming documentary film titled Benghazi 9-11, 'she is going to have to explain why, during her helm at the State Department, one of two things happened: Either, number 1, they were aware of a security situation in Libya and failed to act accordingly, or, number 2, they had such a bad operation that they were not aware of it.'

Sen. Marco Rubio, who reportedly has presidential aspirations of his own, warned that Clinton would need to fully explain her conduct surrounding Benghazi if she were to seek the White House in 2016

If the Accountability Review Board's findings lose credibility, it will likely damage the reputation of co-chair and Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen

In her January 23 testimony before the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, Clinton famously threw up her hands during a heated argument with Wisconsin Republican Senator Ron Johnson and suggested that there was little point in determining the nature of the attack and what led to it, several months after it happened.

'The fact is we had four dead Americans,' Clinton said. 'Was it because of a protest? Or was it because of guys out for a walk one night and decided they would go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make?'

The Obama administration claimed in the days following the terror attack that it was sparked by protesters who were angry about a YouTube video that mocked Muhammad, modern Islam's founding prophet.

'We were misled that there were supposedly protests and then something spread out of that - an assault sprang out of that,' Sen. Johnson insisted. 'And that was easily ascertained that that was not the fact ... And the American people could have known that within days, and they didn't know that.'

U.S. Senator Ron Johnson tangled with Clinton in January over whether the administration misled the public with claims that a YouTuibe video offensive to Muslims sparked violence in Benghazi

Congressional investigators in the House of Representatives established in late 2012 that the Obama administration edited a set of unclassified talking points about the attack Benghazi attack to omit references to al-Qaeda and other radical Islamist terror groups.

CNN reported on Wednesday that sources said as many as three al-Qaeda operatives from inside Yemen took part in the Benghazi attack. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the group that operates in Yemen, is also behind Inspire magazine, the periodical thought to have provided bomb-building instructions for Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the accused Boston Marathon terrorists.

Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is the same group that said in a statement three days after the Sept. 11, 2012 military-style assault on the Benghazi consulate that it was an act of revenge for the 2012 death of al-Qaeda leader Abu Yahya al-Libi. But the group fell short of claiming responsibility for the attack

Four days earlier On September 10, the senior al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri released a video specifically calling for his group's foot soldiers to avenge al-Libi's death by attacking Americans in Libya.

The Accountability Review Board 'did not find that any individual U.S. Government employee engaged in misconduct or willfully ignored his or her responsibilities'

'Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it,' reads the preamble to the board's report on the Benghazi terror attack

The State Department has lacked a permanent inspector general since the beginning of the Obama administration. Although Deputy Inspector General Harold W. Geisel has not publicly confirmed that his office is investigating the the Accountability Review Board's thoroughness, Fox News reported on Wednesday that his office is probing the panel's performance.

An unnamed State Department official told Fox News that the probe is not a 'formal investigation,' but termed it a review process that would also examine previous review boards convened to report on other past incidents.

The Benghazi board interviewed more than 100 witnesses, but there's no evidence they included any U.S. personnel who survived the attack. At least four of them have now retained lawyers to help them circumvent what they say are roadblocks erected by the Obama administration to prevent them from telling Congress what they know.

One of those attorneys, a former Justice Department official and Republican counsel to the Senate Intelligence Committee named Victoria Toensing, told television audiences this week that her client is a civil servant whose career has been threatened by political appointees if he testifies before Congress.

Al Qaeda militants have recently been the subject of a government crackdown in Yemen. These criminal defendants reacted as a verdict upholding their jail sentences was pronounced at a state security court of appeals in April

'Make a bomb in the kitchen of your mom,' advised al-Qaeda's Inspire magazine (L). The periodical is thought to have influenced Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the accused Boston Marathon bomber who died in a shootout with police

The House Oversight and Government Affairs Committee will convene a hearing on May 8 that is expected to include the testimony of several Benghazi survivors.

On Tuesday President Obama claimed he was 'not familiar with this notion that anybody's been blocked from testifying' about the raid in Libya that happened nearly eight months ago.

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney seemed to take refuge the next day in the elapsed time since the terror attack.

'Benghazi happened a long time ago,' Carney told reporters during a briefing Wednesday. 'We are unaware of any agency blocking an employee who would like to appear before Congress.'

Toensing has insisted that despite her active Top Secret security clearance and a demanding letter from Congress, the administration has blocked her from receiving the specific security clearance she would need before she could legally learn what her own client knows.

An April 23 report from House Republicans claimed the Obama administration engaged in a cover-up after hte Benghazi raid, which cost the lived of four including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens (R)

John Kerry, then a Democratic senator from Massachusetts and now the U.S. Secretary of State, visited in early February with at least one Benghazi survivor at the Walter Reed Medical Center in Maryland.

As many as 30 survivors were treated at Walter Reed, according to multiple media reports. Virginia Republican Frank Wolf has claimed that as many as seven may still be there, shielded from the media by the federal government.

South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said in March that he had been in contact with some survivors' families, who told him their loved ones have been 'told to be quiet' by Obama administration officials.
