British Airways has denied claims that it paid £1million to staff after it was reported the airline used specialist investigators to spy on cabin crew during a dispute with Unite over strikes.

The airline allegedly accessed the private emails and phone messages of 10 members of staff, some of whom were union officials, in 2011 when it faced renewed industrial action.

The compensation payment is said to have been made to stop the union suing BA over the alleged surveillance - keeping details of the operation out of court.

The claims were made in The Independent today based on information and documents that have not been seen by MailOnline. They have been categorically denied by the airline.

In January 2011, just months after Len McCluskey was named the new head of Unite, British Airways cabin crew voted in favour of strikes. 

They were later halted after the airline successfully argued union members had not followed ballot procedures.

It was part of an ongoing legal dispute that had started two years previously when BA announced plans to cut staffing levels on jumbo jet flights in a bid to save £63million a year.

While the airline and the union reached an agreement in principle, the dispute became bogged down in knock-on issues about suspension of striking staff and loss of cheap travel perks.

It was in January 2011 that British Airways investigators are believed to have started accessing employees' communication, according to The Independent.

The airline's team of in-house investigators, based at Heathrow, was officially set up to improve passenger safety and security, the newspaper reported.

But Unite claimed investigators used their skills to improperly access communication of its representatives at BA.

Unite's vote to take strike action in 2011 was part of an ongoing legal dispute with British Airways that had started two years previously. Above, passengers affected by cabin crew strikes in 2010

Some of the details uncovered by investigators were described to The Independent as being 'highly personal'.

Unite, Britain's biggest union, instructed Daniel Taylor, founder of Taylor Hampton Solicitors, to represent members of staff who it claimed had been targeted by their employer.

BA maintained that as it owned the mobile phones and computers owned by many of its staff, it had been acting within the law when it took the decision to 'monitor' communications of some staff.

Mr Taylor is understood to have come close to an out-of-court settlement for his client, but he was reportedly dismissed  and the Union completed the final stages of negotiations with BA itself.

He subsequently decided to sue the former client over unpaid fees.

Invoices included in documents filed at the High Court are understood to relate to members of BA staff whose communications were allegedly accessed in 2011, according to The Independent.

Mr Taylor told the newspaper that he had taken the action against Unite 'with a great deal of regret' but was prevented by a confidentiality agreement from discussing further details.

A spokeswoman for British Airways told MailOnline: 'We can state categorically that we have never illegally accessed any telephones or emails of Unite representatives.

'It follows that we made no payment to Unite in relation to any such activity.' 

Unite told MailOnline: 'Unite dealt with Taylor Hampton over a variety of member matters.

'The subsequent dispute with Taylor Hampton over justifiable fees is just one of the things that arise in the normal course of business and has since been resolved to Unite’s satisfaction.'

Taylor Hampton has been contacted by MailOnline for comment.
