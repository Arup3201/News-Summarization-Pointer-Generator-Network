This time a year ago he was a welcome ray of sunlight in a dark winter of discontent for Manchester United.

With pressure growing on David Moyes the form of Adnan Januzaj was one of few reasons to be cheerful for the sing-as-they-suffered Stretford End faithful.

As the under-fire Scot searched for a winning formula (sound familiar?) the youngster signed from Anderlecht in 2011 for £300,0000, was one of only two players to play every game last January.

Adnan Januzaj has gone from being a central player at United to a peripheral figure in less than a year. 

2013-2014

Appearances: 35 Goals: 4

2014-2015

Appearances: 11 Goals: 0 

The 2013 reserve team player of the year had earlier announced himself with a winning brace in a 2-1 win at Sunderland.

Born in Belgium to Albanian-Kosavar parents, almost immediately a tug-of-war over his international allegiance was underway. Roy Hodgson declared an interest and United, wary of similar competition among rival clubs, quickly jumped in with a five-year contract.

Officials at Old Trafford had serious concerns he may go the same way as Paul Pogba, who jumped ship to Italy to much dismay.

Januzaj signed on the dotted line, pledged his allegiance to Belgium and seemed to get better and better.

At the end of the season he could look back with pride on making 35 appearances, despite United's annus horribilis, and look forward to a place in the Marc Wilmotts' much-fancied squad at the World Cup.

Then Louis van Gaal arrived at Old Trafford and it all changed. 

This season he has started and finished just two games. At the last count he has 27 minutes under his belt since the first week in November. Some have even claimed that he only stood out last term because he was in such a poor team and reckon his new teacher is not impressed.

They are wrong and there is mitigation. Van Gaal, armed with an open chequebook, paid a British record £59.7million for Angel di Maria. The seemingly-immovable Wayne Rooney is now being deployed in midfield. Juan Mata is shining behind the strikers. It is a tough line to get to the front of.

Van Gaal's preference for a three-man defence, with the added creativity deploying two wing backs brings, has also damaged the young playmaker's chances.

And nobody would rule against further big-money arrivals in the summer – chief executive Ed Woodward has hinted at it more than once.

As reported by Sportsmail, Januzaj is now expected to depart on loan during this transfer window.

So where next? Moyes remains a keen admirer. In a recent interview with Four Four Two magazine the former United boss, rebuilding his career with Real Sociedad, compared Januzaj with Johan Cruyff, no less. The teenager may well be tempted to rid himself of that sinking feeling on the San Sebastian coast and Moyes has already revealed he will attempt to borrow reinforcements this month.

A less physical competition such as La Liga, along with the increased time on the ball it allows, may well suit a player not noted for his physical presence.

Van Gaal has always been keen on promoting from within and nurturing youth from his early days as a coach.

But he has also shown he is not afraid of getting rid of homegrown talent to Premier League rivals – just ask Danny Welbeck.

And in England there are likely to be other suitors.

Everton are known to be admirers and the chance to link up with Belgium team-mates Kevin Mirallas and Romelu Lukaku may well turn the youngsters head.

A switch to Goodison Park may also get the thumbs up from United pal Maroune Fellaini. The pair are inseparable and Fellaini will no doubt relay fondly tales of his time on Merseyside although he too will sing Moyes' praises.

For United, thought to be monitoring Seamus Coleman, lending Januzaj to Roberto Martinez may well go a long way to opening doors at Everton in their pursuit of the Irish right back further down the line.

Wherever he goes, if he does at all (and knowing United's luck with injuries this season that is always subject to change), he will need to impress.

What a difference a year makes.
