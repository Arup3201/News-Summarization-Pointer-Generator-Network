Patricia Bridle died of a seizure following persistent neglect by staff

Former NHS 
nurse Patricia Bridle was admitted in  February 2008 following a fall 
but went 11 weeks before she was washed, her son Peter claimed 
yesterday.

Mr Bridle,
68, a retired sales manager, said he repeatedly begged nurses to bathe 
the 86-year-old, but each time was told they were too busy.

Towards
the end, the ‘proud’ woman did not want her son to visit because she 
was ‘embarrassed and humiliated to be lying in her own filth’.

Mrs
Bridle was admitted to Alexandra Hospital, Redditch, following a fall 
at her sheltered accommodation.

This triggered a mild stroke and she was
placed on seizure medication so strong it ‘rendered her incapable of 
thought’.

Mr Bride, 
from Redditch, said his mother went from being ‘full of vim and vigour’ 
to someone who ‘couldn’t even speak or feed herself’.

He
said: ‘The staff at the hospital couldn’t have treated her with any 
less respect. The worst part was that a nurse could treat a fellow 
nurse, a carer, that way.’

The
grandmother of six and great-grandmother of seven nursed at St Mary’s 
Hospital, Portsmouth, before raising a family with naval lieutenant 
husband Cyril, who died at the Alexandra – after receiving good care – 
15 years ago.

The 
couple lived for 25 years in Canada, where Mrs Bridle worked as 
supervisor of a hospital sterilisation unit and then as a dental nurse.

After
12 weeks at the Alexandra, Mrs Bridle was transferred to another 
hospital, where she died a week later following a seizure.
