A Miami suburb has been named as the 'bidet capital of America' thanks to new research which reveals homes in the town are 50 times more likely to have one of the unpopular fixtures than the national average. 

According to real estate website Zumper, people living in Sunny Isles Beach in Miami are also 30 times more likely to have a bidet, which is a small basin used to wash your derriere, than those living in New York. 

And it's not just Sunny Isles Beach; Zumper's list of America's top ten bidet cities features four other Florida-based locations, including Aventura, which comes in a close second, and Fort Lauderdale, which places eighth. 

To bidet or not to bidet? While the bathroom fixture (R) is often found in homes in Sunny Isles Beach, elsewhere in America they are incredibly unpopular

'This amounts to a bidet cluster,'  Anthemos Georgiades, CEO of Zumper, explained. 'Probably America's only one.'

Florida's apparent love of the hygienic bathroom fixture goes against the popular belief that bidets have no place in the United States. 

While the country is often praised as one of the most hygienic countries in the world, bidets have never been seen as a popular household feature - despite their overwhelming popularity in much of Continental Europe.

'In around 90% of the some 200 U.S. cities on Zumper, not a single apartment mentions having a bidet,' Mr Georgiades added. 'So, we're talking in the American context of a pretty niche amenity.

'There may seem to be something un-American about bidets. But there seems something less un-Floridian about them.'

Indeed, the only state which comes close to rivaling Florida's bidet dominance is Maryland, which has three cities - Midford, Newton and Somerville - in the top ten list of Bidet cities.  

'Many Americans may not be certain what bidets are for,' Mr Georgiades said of the bidet's unpopularity.

So, what explains their relative popularity in Sunny Isles Beach? Mr Georgiades is unsure. 

'Maybe it's a way to cope with all the sand?' he speculated. 'Or maybe they just took the fancy of certain local architects or developers.'
