Cristiano Ronaldo has demanded Louis van Gaal be afforded time to shape Manchester United, just like Sir Alex Ferguson got early in his reign, and predicts the Dutchman will eventually bring the title back to Old Trafford.

The Real Madrid star is planning to watch United’s clash against Chelsea on Sunday on television in Spain and believes fit-again Angel Di Maria could prove the decisive factor.

United trail leaders Chelsea by 10 points having only won three times in eight games and Ronaldo thinks the gap is too large to bridge, signaling Jose Mourinho’s side as would-be champions.

But he thinks Van Gaal can lead United into the Champions League places – and would relish the prospect of dueling with his former side in Europe’s elite competition again.

‘Sometimes the coaches need time to change the team to what they want,’ said Ronaldo. ‘In the Premier League all the teams are fighting a lot for points and even the clubs at the bottom of the table can beat those at the top. So it is tough.

‘I read something recently from Sir Alex Ferguson saying Van Gaal will need time and he is right. In the beginning even Sir Alex didn’t win anything for a few years and it was a complicated time for him while he got the team together that he wanted.

‘To get a good squad and a good team takes time so lets give Van Gaal the time he needs. He is a fantastic coach and very experienced and I am certain he will make United champions again, if not this year then very spoon after that.’

Di Maria has performed best of all the players bought in Van Gaal’s £156million summer spree – scoring or assisting seven goals in his six Premier League games. Ronaldo is still in touch with his former Real team-mate and says the Argentine will raise his game against Mourinho’s men.

‘To change Spain for England is always going to be a big difference because the weather is not the same in Manchester as it is in Madrid. It's colder, often raining and always cloudy,’ said Ronaldo.

‘Of course it is going to be a big, big challenge for him but I am 100% sure he will be a massive success at United. He will enjoy it I know.

‘It’s great that he might be fit to play Chelsea because Angel was always an important player for Real Madrid in the big games – he always rises to the occasion.’

Ronaldo believes this season is too soon for United to reclaim the title, but is rooting for his old club to finish in the top four.

‘Let’s see. They aren't in a good moment because they have dropped many points but they have a good coach and we need to give him time and see what happens.

‘It would be amazing and good news for me if they did make the Champions League because I would love to play against them again.

Ronaldo says 'you can never write off Manchester United' but that Chelsea are already too far ahead this year

‘You can never write off Manchester United. It is only the beginning but it will be tough for United to win the title this year I think because they are already too many points behind Chelsea in my opinion.

‘Chelsea are a little bit stronger than all the other teams this year. But of course in the Premier League over a season you never know what can happen. That period near Christmas is really tough and you can easily drop points because there are a lot of games in a really short space of time.

‘Chelsea have made a great start and they can be champions. I hope Manchester United can come again at the top of the league.

‘At the moment they are many points behind Chelsea and have had some disappointing results at the start of the season. But let's see what happens it is an exciting league and anything can happen.’
