The words 'halfbreed' and 'breed' are offensive and should be removed from the names of creeks and other places in Montana, a state lawmaker said.

Republican Rep Nicholas Schwaderer introduced a bill yesterday that would require state and other agencies to strip the terms from maps, signs and markers when 'wear or vandalism' make a replacement necessary.

The idea for the latest measure came out of work with members of the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians.

The Montana bill would also create a volunteer advisory group to determine replacement names. 

Halfbreed Lake National Wildlife Refuge is the most prominent of 17 places throughout Montana with the word 'half-breed' or 'breed' in the name, according to Nicholas Vrooman, a historian who works with the Little Shell Tribe.

Similar measures have passed elsewhere across the US, though the federal government outlaws only two types of place names.

The US Board on Geographic Names is the government body that approves all names on maps put out by federal agencies, including the US Geological Survey and the US Army Corps of Engineers.

They include:

In 1963, it changed geographic names containing a derogatory term for black people (the N-word), and in 1974 it changed all names containing a disparaging word for Japanese ('Jap').

The board has strict rules about changing names, and says it discourages name changes unless necessary.

It 'prefers to interfere as little as possible within the use of names in everyday language because attitudes and perceptions of words considered to be pejorative vary between individuals and can change connotation from one generation to another'.

However there have been local pushes to eliminate offensive names found on geographic features throughout the country.

The new Montana bill expands on one that passed through the state legislature in 1999 to remove 'squaw' from place names in the state. 

All 76 places in Montana with that word since have been changed, or a change is pending.

At least nine other states — Florida, Idaho, North Carolina, Oregon, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Minnesota, Maine and Tennessee — also have removed the offensive word from place names or have passed legislation encouraging it. 

Gerald J Gray Sr, director of the Little Shell Tribe's native languages program, testified that as someone with a heritage that includes Chippewa, Cree, Blackfeet, French and Scottish, he has been referred to as a 'dirty half-breed' throughout his life.

'I never told any non-Indians that I was an Indian or that I was 'breed,' as I knew I would be subjected to some snide or racist remarks, ostracized or made to feel I was out of place,' Mr Gray said.

A Republican member of the Nebraska Board of Education, Pat McPherson, recently used the term 'half-breed' to refer to President Obama on his blog.

The education board, Nebraska governor Pete Ricketts and the state's two US senators have all called for his resignation, which Mr McPherson has refused.

He has since taken down his 'Objective Conservative' blog and said he is not a racist.

'Kyke Creek on Jew Mountain' and other offensive places 

The Geographic Names Information System lists places with the terms 'half-breed' or 'breed' in Nebraska, Iowa and North Dakota.

There have also been pushes to eliminate other offensive names found on geographic features throughout the country. 

There are 757 places with 'Negro' in the name, according to an analysis of government records in 2012, though many of those place names were not spelled that way originally.

The Geographic Names Information System lists nine places with the word 'Negro' in Montana, along with seven places using the offensive term 'Chinaman'.

Montana also has a stream called 'Kyke Creek' located on 'Jew Mountain' and a dam called 'Sambo Number 1 Dam'.

A draft of Rep Schwaderer's bill available on the state legislature's website makes no mention of other offensive terms. 

Daily Mail Online has reached out to the representative for comment.

Twenty places throughout the US used 'Dago' (and many more that have been changed to 'Italian'), and there were 1,100 Squaws, six 'Polacks,' 10 Cripples, 58 places named Gypsy, and 30 'Chinamans'.

There were eight 'Injuns,' 35 'Spooks,' 14 'Sambos,'  30 'Spades,' and too many 'Coons' to count.

There are also at least seven 'Darkeys'.
