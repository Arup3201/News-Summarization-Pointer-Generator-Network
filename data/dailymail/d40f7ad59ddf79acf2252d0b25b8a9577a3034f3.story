The prime suspect in the grisly 2004 murder of a 21-year-old performing arts student claims his alleged victim speaks to him from beyond the grave, as he maintains his innocence.

In a bizarre interview Dimitry Sheinman told the New York Post that Juilliard student Sarah Fox loves him and is angry that her 'real killer' hasn't been caught.

The young woman disappeared while jogging through Inwood Hill Park. Her strangled, naked body was found six days later, propped up and surrounded by two dozen yellow tulip petals.

Residents suspected Sheinman because he regularly patrolled the park with his unleashed Rhodesian ridgeback, starting fights with people.

He became the 'No. 1 suspect,' after he told investigators he had a vision of the killer and offering up details that were never released publicly.

However, investigators couldn't find any evidence linking him to the murder so he was never charged.

He was now lives in Cape Town, South Africa with his wife and two daughters.

According to The Post, a picture of Fox stares up from under the glass tabletop at his comfortable home.

'You know when people ask, "Does she communicate with you?" Of course she does! Who else would she communicate with?' he told the newspaper.

'Let me show you the bastard now - I'm sorry, Sarah - you see, Sarah wants this guy's blood, but the tension energizes the table. She just f***ing wants his blood, man.

'Sometimes I walk by and she winks at me, you know. And she knows: "I know exactly what you're doing, and I love you."

'Right now she just looked at me and made a bunch of faces. She knows what's going on. I can't speak for her, but she knows exactly what's going on.'

He then showed The Post a picture of the 'real killer' whom he told police about in 2012 after having a new vision of Fox's death.

'He's very scared. He's scared of me. I've never communicated with him directly but ... he's a disgusting, revolting man,' Sheinman said.

'Do I like him? Not much. He's a f***ing a**hole.'

Investigators dismissed the suspect he named, because they'd already interviewed him and ruled him out.

They still believe Sheinman is the culprit.

'I think it's him. There's no real doubt that it's him, but we haven't proved it yet,' said a police source close to the investigation told The Post.

The 49-year-old moved to South Africa in 2006 and now works as a psychic healer.

'I don't do anything because I'm nice. 
I'm not nice,' Sheinman told The Post. 'I see healing as a selfish 
activity because it makes me feel good. I have no choice but to heal. It
 is what's been chosen for me. I have no choice but to heal; otherwise 
I'd probably have to hurt people.'

Sheinman recalls falling 'into a trance' while detectives at the 34th Precinct station questioned him in 2004 and he saw the crime play out.

'At first I couldn't understand. I was confused. I was trying to help the police with their investigations, and then they began treating me as a suspect,' he said.

'I used to believe in the police, and in the state, but this showed me how useless everything was. The whole investigation was a f***ing mess.'

His wife, Jane, told the newspaper that her family has been rocked by the allegations.

'Theyâ€™ve treated us so terribly. The impact on our family has just been ... and for the girls!' she said, adding that she hopes their daughters, aged 8 and 11, can lead 'normal lives' in their adopted home.
