Broadcaster Richard Bacon has condemned the gap between rich and poor in Britain – while renting out his home for £15,000 a month.

The former Radio 5 Live host calls for an end to an unfair system in which ‘the rich get richer and the poor get poorer’ in an interview to promote the Channel 4 programme How Rich Are You?, which he presents.

But that hasn’t stopped him cashing in on the soaring rental value of his £3 million home in North London’s trendy Belsize Park. Bacon, 38, who is moving temporarily to Los Angeles with his wife Rebecca and their two young children, has put the property on the rental market for £3,500 a week.

The house, which has more than doubled in value since he bought it seven years ago, is on the books of an upmarket estate agent.

It says clients looking for a long-term let will appreciate its off-street parking, 90ft garden and summer house, which can double as a guest room or study.

In the interview, which appears in this week’s Radio Times, Bacon complains: ‘Our wealth gap is the worst in Europe.

‘Countries with big inequality gaps have big prison populations, have worse obesity rates, are less trusting, and have higher rates of violence. 

'The gap matters, and we want people to understand that. Inequality is a great issue of our time without people being aware of it.’

Bacon added: ‘We’re all talking about ebola and ISIS but this is something that is really affecting our country.’

Adding that ‘a debate could start a revolution’, he admits: ‘My house has gone up in value by an absolutely ridiculous amount.

‘I am relatively wealthy and I have had a lot of luck.

‘But that troubles me and it always has. The rich just get richer. Wealth begets wealth. The more you have, the more you get.’

The broadcaster, who was famously sacked as a Blue Peter presenter in 1998 for taking cocaine, left Radio 5 Live in September after four years presenting the mid-afternoon show. The shake-up at the station also saw the departures of Victoria Derbyshire and Shelagh Fogarty.

His agent, Russell Garnett, said Bacon would be working on various projects in the US but was not leaving Britain for good.

According to Channel 4, How Rich Are You?, which is screened tomorrow night, is about Britain in an age polarised between bling and benefits.

Bacon told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It examines the polarisation of wealth in the UK and the factors at play determining social mobility. I’m aware that I am relatively wealthy and luck has played a large part in that, particularly in the housing market.

‘Actually, that kind of luck is partly what this show is about.’
