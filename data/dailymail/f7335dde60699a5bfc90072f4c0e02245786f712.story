A chief constable who became the first police chief to be sacked in 35 years has told a court he cannot repay £500,000 his former bosses claim he should never have been paid because he no longer has the money. 

Sean Price, 56, was dismissed from his position at Cleveland Police in October 2012 for gross misconduct.

The force's Police and Crime Commissioner Barry Coppinger is now suing him for the payment which was part of a 'golden handcuffs' deal to keep him in post prior to the scandal.

The civil claim, which is expected to last two weeks and will take place in March, comes after the force said he should never have been paid the money. 

Following a preliminary hearing before Mr Justice Coulson at Newcastle Crown Court, Mr Price told reporters the move was vindictive, that Mr Coppinger had been party to agreeing the payments when he was a member of Cleveland Police Authority, and that the case was a waste of public money.

Police authorities were replaced by PCCs' offices following elections in 2012.

Outside court, he said: 'It is a real irony that Barry Coppinger was one of the people who authorised those payments to me because they wanted me to stay in Cleveland Police, and it is now he that has tried to get the money back.

'I look forward to it.

'I don't think it is lawful what they are trying to do, but a court is going to have to hear it.'

He referred to the £5million cost of Operation Sacristy which looked at allegations of corruption in the force, and led to no-one being prosecuted.

'This feels like vindictiveness, "we need to win this whatever it takes", and I have done nothing wrong.

'I haven't got the money and this is a further waste of public money.'

Mr Price, who is representing himself in court, claimed the cost to the public so far in legal fees was £50,000.

'Imagine how much a two-week trial is going to cost,' he added.

Cleveland Police is suing Mr Price in an attempt to reclaim £500,000 which was allegedly given to him as part of a 'golden handcuffs' deal to keep him in his role as chief constable in the years prior to the scandal breaking

Mr Price said the payments made to him by Cleveland Police Authority in the mid-2000s were to stop him from switching forces, and he kept his side of the bargain.

'If it transpires they were not lawfully entitled to make those payments, that is their mistake not mine,' he said.

Mr Price was sacked after it was found he lied about helping the police authority chairman's daughter get a job with the force.
