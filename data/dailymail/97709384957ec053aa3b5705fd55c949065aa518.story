A couple living in the upscale Brooklyn neighborhood of Park Slope have revealed that they use chamber pots in lieu of a bathroom.

While most of us would consider a flushing toilet a basic requirement, Marcela and Ryan Marshall have been doing without for the past three years.

They insist that the practice is 'not so crazy, and are prepared to make a sacrifice because they pay just $300-a-month in rent (typically studios in the family-friendly area rent for upwards of $1,700 a month).

Marcela tells The Hairpin: 'It's what 
people have been doing for hundreds - thousands - of years.'

She explains that they empty the chamber pots in the gutter on the street in the early morning, then rinse them down with water.

Chamber pots did take some getting used to though, Ryan admits.

'Let's just say it was summer when we moved in,' he recalls. 'We
don't have or ideologically support air conditioning, so nights could 
get a little rough, especially when you don't know what to expect when 
you lift the lid... It's not necessarily for the squeamish.'

Nor, Ryan adds, was one chamber pot enough.

'That didn't work out so hot,' he says.

The couple now actually take some pride in the chamber pots they use, sourcing sea glass-glazed versions from a local artist.

Marcela loves them so much, she has been buying extras to give as gifts to friends, adding that she '[hasn't] heard any complaints'.

They are preferable to metal, Ryan reveals, which 'can
be obtrusive in personal places'. The handmade versions are also more 
akin to the kind that were used by the building's residents 150 years 
ago.

'It's helped us feel closer 
to the building, to its history, and to each other,' he says.

Though resorting to a property without a bathroom is extreme, the Marshalls are not alone in wanting to live in Park Slope.

Not only does the pretty Brooklyn locale have wide, tree-lined streets and elegant brownstone properties, but it boasts excellent local schools and the much-loved Prospect Park, making it popular with couples and young families.

Real estate firm Prudential Douglas Elliman told the New York Times earlier this year that the median property sale price in Park Slope had jumped nearly 20per cent year-on-year, from 1.2million to $1.45million.
