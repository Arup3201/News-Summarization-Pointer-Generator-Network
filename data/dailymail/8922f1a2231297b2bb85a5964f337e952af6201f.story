Sean Abbott had figures of six for 14 from seven overs as he helped New South Wales to an innings victory over Queensland in his first match since the death of Phillip Hughes - and won applause and praise from David Warner.

Australia batsman Hughes died on November 27 aged 25, two days after being struck on the neck by a bouncer from paceman Abbott while batting for South Australia.

The 22-year-old Abbott led his side to victory on day three with a brilliant display, ripping through the middle and lower order as Queensland were all out for 99 and Warner went on Instagram to tell of his pride in his 'good mate'.

'Credit to my good mate @sean_abbott bowling NSW to victory against QLD today. Been a tough week for everyone but this bloke has a genuine heart of gold and has fought hard this week to come back and bowl again. Well done mate proud of you.' 

This came after Warner, while batting for Australia against India at the Adelaide Oval, applauded when he saw Abbott's figures flash up on the big screen.

Abbott, enjoying some slightly damp conditions, was on a hat-trick after dismissing Chris Hartley and Cameron Brimblecombe with consecutive deliveries, but Luke Feldman fended off a yorker on the next delivery.

New South Wales won the Sheffield Shield match by an innings and 80 runs at the SCG.  

Warner later completed his century in the second innings of Australia's match with India
