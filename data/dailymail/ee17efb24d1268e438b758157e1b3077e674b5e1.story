Manchester United, Bayern Munich and Barcelona are all hovering over Borussia Dortmund forward Marco Reus after he reportedly turned down a new deal.

Germany star Reus, 25, is believed to have a £27.6million buyout clause in his contract and Bild are reporting that he is determined to engineer a move to one of the world's top sides by refusing to extend his stay at the Westfalenstadion beyond 2017.

Reus is highly regarded by the likes of Louis van Gaal and United could make him their marquee signing of the summer despite the forward missing out on the World Cup with Germany with an ankle ligament injury.

Bayern and Barcelona are thought to be frontrunners but United also hold an interest. Liverpool would like to make a move but his price tag may prove out of their range.

The 25-year-old is now able to run freely and is targeting a return to full fitness by the start of September.

But the availability of one of Europe's hottest talents at a relatively low cost has peaked the interest of the three Continental giants, even with Reus' injury issues.

He scored 21 goals in 39 matches for Dortmund last season and would offer United, in particular, more creativity and goalscoring from deep.

However, Van Gaal's men must hope he does not want to follow former team-mates Mario Gotze and Robert Lewandowski to Munich.
