'Unacceptable': Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson has spoken out about women not being rewarded equally in the workplace

Companies with more than 250 workers will be forced to publish details of their gender pay gap in a major Government U-turn.

Liberal Democrat MPs are pushing to bring into effect measures in the 2010 Equality Act – which were not implemented by the Coalition – making companies publish the difference between male and female pay.

Conservatives resisted the plans on the basis that companies should not be loaded with more red tape as the economy recovers from the financial crash.

But government sources said that with Labour backing a change in the law, the Tories were confronted with the prospect of defeat in a crunch vote in the House of Lords. 

One said Conservative ministers had agreed the reform would be introduced, but only after a consultation with business leaders on exactly how it will work. 

Former Conservative deputy prime minister Lord Heseltine said he opposed the legislation because it would create ‘more bureaucracy, more forms, more deterrent for companies to take on people’.

The new law will make it compulsory for larger companies to publish the average difference between the pay of their male and female employees.

 A voluntary approach to pay transparency encouraged by the Government has so far led to only five of the country’s larger companies revealing their gender pay gaps.

Labour says that analysis of the Office for National Statistics’ annual survey of hours and earnings show that over a career, from the age of 22 to 64, a woman earns an average of £209,976 less than men.

Gloria de Piero, shadow minister for women and equalities, said firms which had already decided to publish gender pay gap data had said ‘the ceiling didn’t cave in’, adding: ‘It just enabled them to see they had a problem and get to grips with it.’

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: ‘While the Liberal Democrats have made real progress in areas like shared parental leave and extending the right to request flexible working, the labour market is still stacked against women.

‘It simply cannot be acceptable that, in the 21st century, women on average still receive a smaller pay packet than men.

‘We can’t wait and we can’t dither. We need to sort this out now. Finally, we are now in a position for the Government to vote through our party’s manifesto commitment for large companies to publish the difference in average pay between male and female employees.

‘These measures will shine a light on a company’s policy so that women can rightly challenge their employer where they are not being properly valued and rewarded.’

A Lib Dem source added: ‘In discussions this week it was clear that the Tories wanted to delay taking any action on equal pay and kick the can down the road, just like they have for the last five years.

‘It’s a huge U-turn from the Tories but it’s welcomed. At last we can take some real action.’ The change in the law will be made in an amendment to the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Bill.

Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson said: ‘It is utterly unacceptable that women are not being equally rewarded in the workplace.’

A Tory source said: ‘We have made sure there must be proper consultation with business about how it works – not something either Labour or the Lib Dems were concerned with.’

It will take 70 years before the gender pay gap closes worldwide, the United Nations has claimed.

And it will be another 81 years before women have the same chance as men of becoming a chief executive, and 50 before women are just as likely to lead their country.

According to the International Labour Organization, there is not a country in the world which has yet achieved gender equality. The UN agency found women who start families before they turned 25 suffered a particularly large ‘wage penalty’.

Executive director of UN Women, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, said world leaders must ensure that ‘promoting gender equality’ was a ‘top issue on their agenda, which it isn’t now’.
