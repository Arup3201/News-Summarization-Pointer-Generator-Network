Cops are looking for a man who took a photo of himself with an iPad stolen from a Colorado gymnastics facility.

An iPad, as well as several others, were taken from the business.

Anyone with information on this man is asked to contact Officer Katey McDonald at 970-962-2052

The image of the unidentified man, the website reports, appeared in the company's iCloud account from that iPad on March 8.

Loveland police continue to look for the unidentified man. Anyone with information is asked to contact Officer Katey McDonald at 970-962-2052.

This is not the only recent story involving an alleged thief taking 'selfies' on electronic equipment.

The images were found in the company's iCloud account linked to its stolen iPad, like the one seen in this stock image

Last month, an Alabama teen was arrested after cops said he stole a cell phone and laptop and took pictures of himself on both devices, Alabama.com reported at the time.

Speaking about the alleged teen thief, Jefferson County Chief Deputy said, 'I go back to what I've always said -- If they were a little smarter it would be much more difficult to catch them. We have us a real self-absorbed thief here, not a rocket scientist mind you, but he loves himself nevertheless.'
