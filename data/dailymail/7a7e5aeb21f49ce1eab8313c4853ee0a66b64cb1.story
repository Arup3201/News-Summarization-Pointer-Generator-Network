A man has told how he is refusing to leave the home he was born in 62 years ago despite the council flattening the surrounding 600 houses.

Charlie Wright has turned down numerous offers from the council to move from his childhood home in Birkenhead, Merseyside.

But he is not budging from the home, even though he has no neighbours and no community.

Resolute: Charlie Wright is now the last resident left in an old council estate in Birkenhead which was once made up of 600 homes

Isolated: Chalie Wright's home is the only landmark on a desolate stretch of scrubland left after the council estate was demolished

All alone: Mr Wright's home, circled in red, is now the last inhabited building on a site where once stood 600 homes

Mr Wright said: 'I was born in this house and I have been here for 62 years.

'My mum got the house after the War and she brought ten of us up in here. I’m the last one and I’m staying here.

'This was one of the best estates ever. We had everything but now we have nothing, not even neighbours.

'I used to have hundreds of neighbours but now it’s just us.'

Mr Wright’s house is bookended by two partially demolished buildings and lies on a street surrounded by wasteland.

Occupied: In the 1960s, the street was full of houses

Last man standing: Charlie Wright refuses to leave the house where he was born 62 years ago despite requests from the council to vacate the property

Bygone times: It was a thriving road which had a cafe and had a steady flow of traffic

Changed: This is how the land around Ilchester Road looked in 1936. Most of the housing has now been demolished

Despite not being much to look at, he loves his home, and his sense of pride can be seen through the flagpole flying a Union Flag in his back garden.

Having been born and bred in the home alongside his nine brothers and sisters, his family eventually bought the house from the council.

But Mr Wright is refusing to give it back without a fight.

Home sweet home: Charlie Wright has lost all of his neighbours as, one by one, their homes have been knocked down by the council

Determined: Mr Wright has refused to leave the house he bought off the council without a fight

He said: 'I don’t need anyone to fight my battles but if the council wants a war, it’s got a war because I’m staying here.

'At one time around here, everyone had families. They grew up and stayed for years and there was real community spirit.

Alone: Mr Wright grew up on the estate playing with friends in the street by now has no neighbours

'There were nice five-bedroomed houses and people like living here. I look around now and can’t believe it’s all gone. The situation angers and upsets me.

'The reason given by the council when they wanted to clear the area was that there was too much housing stock and no-one to live there.

'That’s rubbish, because I have spoken to friends who used to live here, who say they would give anything to move back - if there was anything to move back to.

The estate, which lies near to Birkenhead’s docks, was once a sea of 600 post-war houses, home to thousands of workers who sustained the manufacturing and shipbuilding industries.

Plans were put into place to clear homes to make way for new factories, but the jobs and investment failed to materialise, leaving the area desolate and unkept.

While 14,000 people from the estate were once employed in the industrial sector, this dropped to just 1,300 by the mid 1980s, causing the area to slip towards poverty - however there was still a sense of community for families.

Mr Wright, a former boilerman and shop steward, said: 'We use to play on these streets as kids. Kids grew up, got married and got a house on the estate. Their kids would go and see their gran.

'I had three uncles and aunties on streets nearby. All of our family was brought up on this estate and I’m the last one out of the lot.

'At the end of the day if I had to move out, I don’t know what I’d do or where I’d end up,' he said.

'I have been offered other places to live, but none of them have been any good.'
