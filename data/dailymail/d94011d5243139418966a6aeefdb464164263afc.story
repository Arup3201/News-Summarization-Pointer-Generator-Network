Amy Pascal was spotted out for the first time since the studio head and Sony decided not to distribute their upcoming film The Interview. 

Pascal was seen heading into Sony's New York City headquarters on Madison Avenue Friday, arriving with two SUVs of security and being escorted in to the building by two burly bodyguards.

This just two days after Sony decided they would not release their upcoming Kim Jong-un assassination film The interview.

Pascal has had a busy week in New York, not only dealing with fallout from Sony's decision but also from the public outrage caused by a racist email exchange between her and producer Scott Rudin.

The studio head took some time to meet with Al Sharpton over that exchange, which mocked President Obama, and Sharpton reported afterwards that Sony had said they would be creating a group to deal with the lack of racial diversity in Hollywood. 

At the same time Pascal was spotted, President Obama was giving a news conference in which he called her decision, and that of the studio, to not release the film a 'mistake.'

Pascal has not yet commented on this, though she did apologize for her racist statements last week.

'The content of my emails to Scott were insensitive and inappropriate but are not an accurate reflection of who I am,' she said.

'Although this was a private communication that was stolen, I accept full responsibility for what I wrote and apologize to everyone who was offended.'

Following President Obama's news conference Friday, the studio did hint at the fact that they may still release the film in the future.
