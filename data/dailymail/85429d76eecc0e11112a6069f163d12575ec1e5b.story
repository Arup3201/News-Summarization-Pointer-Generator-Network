A senior member of staff at scandal-hit Cleveland Police has been suspended after allegations she misused thousands of pounds of public funds, it has been announced today.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission said it is investigating allegations against assistant chief officer Ann Hall - the force's most senior civilian member of staff - and an independent inquiry has begun.

ACO Hall, who is responsible for finance and commissioning, is the subject of allegations that unauthorised payments were made to an executive coaching company.

Assistant chief officer Ann Hall has been suspended from Cleveland Police as The Independent Police Complaints Commission investigates claims thousands of pounds of public funds were misused

Ann Hall has been suspended while the IPCC investigates the allegations

The IPCC said the latest allegations do not form part of Operation Sacristy, a wide-ranging investigation into alleged corruption at the force.

Last year, Chief Constable Sean Price was sacked and allegations have also been made against his deputy Derek Bonnard.

Mr Bonnard faces a misconduct hearing next month.

Cleveland Police said ACO Hall's suspension during the investigation is a neutral act.

IPCC Commissioner Cindy Butts said: 'Any allegations of misuse of public funds is serious and must be investigated.

'Given the recent history of Cleveland Police and the investigations into former Chief Constable Sean Price and his deputy Derek Bonnard I can appreciate that news of this investigation may cause some concern among the public.

'I can assure them this investigation will be thorough and conducted as quickly as possible.'

Cleveland Police said the allegation 
against Ms Hall related to a period between July 2010 and October 2011, 
and said the IPCC was informed last week.

A
spokeswoman said: 'It should be emphasised that suspension is a neutral
act and it should not be inferred from the decision to suspend that any
potential misconduct matters have been proven.

'In addition and separate to the IPCC 
inquiry, the force is undertaking an investigation via an independent 
investigator into matters referred to Cleveland Police by Operation 
Sacristy concerning ACO Hall.

'The focus of the force will remain on operational policing and protecting and serving the communities of Cleveland.'

Mr
Price became the first chief constable to be sacked in 35 years when a 
disciplinary panel found he had lied about his role in the recruitment 
of the former police authority chairmanâ€™s daughter.

It also found he directed a member of staff to lie about it.

Mr
Bonnard faces a four week disciplinary hearing into alleged misconduct 
and is suspended from his role of Deputy Chief Constable.

A separate investigation is being carried out into alleged corruption in the force. Last year Sean Price, pictured, became the first chief constable to be sacked in 35 years
