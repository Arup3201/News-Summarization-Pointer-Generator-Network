A pensioner has been told that he must cut back a tree in his council property or he may face eviction - despite the fact that it was already there when he moved in.

Widower Brian Smithers, 73, has lived in his house in New Malden, south-east London for 30 years. He lost his wife two years ago.

Now, he has been told by the council that he should 'consider moving to a property without a garden'.

Kingston council, which manages the property, has said that Mr Smithers must maintain the tree or find another home.

A letter from the council’s housing management team read: 'You must pay urgent attention to these matters now.

'If
 you are unable to manage the gardens and find it too much, perhaps you 
might consider moving to a property without a garden so you no longer 
have this burden.

'If the 
tree has not been dealt with and the garden at the rear and front cut 
down so that it is tidy and well cared for as it should be, then I will 
have no other option but to serve you with a notice of seeking 
possession and you might lose your home as a result.'

Mr Smithers said: 'They want me to chop it down but I said no because it’s their tree. They are trying to evict me. I am a pensioner.

'The tree was here when I moved in. It 
is leaning quite badly and the roots look like a lot of snakes but they 
want me to pay for it. But it is their tree they have got to deal with 
it.'

Local councillor Terry Paton said he was 'horrified' by the letter.

He said: 'I think we should be looking to help someone so vulnerable rather than threatening them.

'The poor guy has just lost his wife and does not need to be treated like that. I feel a lot of sympathy.'

A Kingston Council spokesman said the council had acted on complaints from neighbours. He added that part of Mr Smither's tenancy agreement was to keep the garden in order.

The council spokesman added: 'We are concerned that Mr Smithers, an elderly tenant, may be finding managing the gardens which are his responsibility too much of a burden.

'We will deal with the tree, and we are trying to discuss with Mr Smithers the possibility of him moving to a home without gardens to look after.

'He wasn’t at home last week when a housing officer called for an arranged appointment.'

Mr Smithers has now received support from others through social media.

One person said: 'If his neighbours feel strongly about it, why don’t they help the old guy, I am sure someone has a saw and a ladder, I would go and do it for him if I knew where he was.'
