Apple is being sued in a price-fixing case that could see eBook prices fall sharply.

The U.S. Department of Justice claims that the technology company and five of the world's largest publishers colluded to cost shoppers 'tens of millions of dollars'.

Apple, HarperCollins, Hachette, Penguin Group, Macmillan and Simon & Schuster are accused of conspiring over phone calls, emails and meals in the 'private dining rooms of upscale Manhattan restaurants'.

The Justice Department is investigating alleged price-fixing by Apple and five major publishers: Simon & Schuster, HarperCollins Publishers, Lagardere SCA's Hachette Book Group, Pearson and Macmillan

The DoJ claims the alleged 
price-fixing came in response to Amazon's aggressive pricing policy, 
which challenged the industry with a maximum eBook price of $9.99 (£6), 
lower than that offered by many of its rivals.

If the lawsuit is successful, prices 
on the Kindle and other e-readers could tumble in the U.S. and Britain.

Such a victory would end the deal struck by Apple that prevented 
publishers from selling books via Amazon or elsewhere at lower prices 
than they offered on Apple's iTunes Store.

The arrangement has meant that many eBooks cost the same – or even more than – their paper counterparts.

Apple and the publishers are accused 
of creating a so-called 'agency model' of pricing, under which they 
dictate the price of an eBook as long as they give 30 per cent of the 
revenue to the retailer.

The agency model, set up when Apple 
launched its iPad in 2010 and since widely adopted, was seen as an 
attempt to ease Amazon's grip on the digital market.

Previously, retailers set the price of
 eBooks themselves – but many sacrificed their profit margin to win 
market share. This lowered customers' expectations of how much an eBook 
should cost. It also rattled publishers, who viewed eBooks as a way of 
propping up their overall profits.

A spokesman for the DoJ said: 
'Publishers saw the rise on eBooks, and particularly Amazon's price 
discounting, as a substantial challenge to their traditional business 
model.

'[They] feared that lower retail 
prices for eBooks might lead eventually to lower wholesale prices for 
eBooks [and] lower prices for print books.' To combat this, they 'teamed
 up with Apple, which shared the same goal of restraining retail price 
competition', they added.

The European Commission is already investigating alleged price-fixing in the eBook market.

Jim Friedland, an analyst at Cowen 
& Co, said victory for the DoJ 'would be a positive for Amazon 
because the company's greatest strength is as a high-volume, low-price 
retailer and the wholesale model plays into that'.

Amazon's Jeff Bezos: The internet retailer has been left unable to discount ebooks after a deal between Apple and publishers

Apple did a deal with publishers two years ago which led to retailers such as Amazon being unable to discount books to lower prices than iTunes store

Late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs reportedly did not want 
Apple's iBook store to compete with Amazon's cheap prices, and helped broker the deal between publishers.

The European Commission is 
investigating claims that Apple and five publishing houses worked 
together to keep eBook prices artificially high.

It
 is also suggested that the arrangement killed competition by ensuring 
that Apple’s rivals, such as Amazon and Kobo, could not undercut its 
prices.

In The UK, the
 Government is partly to blame for the high cost. The Treasury has 
sanctioned an anomaly in the tax system which means VAT is charged at 20
 per cent on eBooks, but is not applied to real books.

The boom in eBooks 
is a goldmine for  publishers and technology firms, because the costs 
are a fraction of those involved in printing, transporting and selling 
books.

Despite the savings, the prices of blockbuster eBooks are often higher than the real thing.

In the UK, the Government is partly to
 blame for the high cost of eBooks. The Treasury has sanctioned an 
anomaly in the tax system which means VAT is charged at 20 per cent on 
eBooks, but is not applied at all to 'real' books.

The boom in eBooks is a goldmine for 
publishers and technology firms, as distribution costs are a fraction of
 those involved in printing, transporting and selling books.

The Daily Mail reported yesterday that
 paperback sales are down 25 per cent, largely due to the rise of the 
Kindle – which is made by Amazon – and similar devices.

HarperCollins, Hachette and Simon & Schuster have settled the claims but Penguin and Macmillan still face litigation.

Macmillan said the DoJ's settlement terms 'were too onerous' and denied the company acted illegally.

A Penguin spokesman said: 'A 
responsible company does not choose a path of litigation with U.S. 
government agencies without carefully weighing the implications of that 
course of action. We have done nothing wrong [and] we believe that the 
agency model is the one that offers consumers the prospect of an open 
and competitive market for eBooks.'

Apple declined to comment.
