A couple who underwent IVF treatment with the hope of having a girl, have told of their 'anger' and 'disappointment' when they found out they were expecting twin boys.

In first person pieces for Babble.com - which have recently come to light - the pair, who write under the pseudonyms Albert and Paula Garland, reveal how they even considered aborting one of the fetuses but decided it was 'too Machiavellian'.

Instead they followed through with the pregnancy and, in the run up to the birth of their boys this August, 
they said they felt like 'cancer patients with only months to live', not expectant parents.

Double trouble: A couple who underwent IVF treatment with the hope of having a girl, have told of their 'anger' and 'disappointment' when they found out they were expecting twin boys

'My wife and I even both privately admitted that we don’t like the new children, which is of course insane,' Mr Garland wrote.

The couple's musings sparked a furious backlash, with many readers deeming them
'ungrateful', 'selfish' and 'irresponsible'.

'Seriously, suck. it. up,' one commenter 
wrote. And another added: 'Part of me actually 
hopes you just wrote this for attention and you are making this whole 
thing up.

'I’d like to think that no one is really this dishearten over 
their own "thought out" decisions.'

'My wife and I both privately admitted that we don't like the new children'

The Garlands, who already have a young 
son, said they had been trying to provide him with a sister for nearly 
two years, which left them 'exhausted' and 'depressed'.

As a last ditch effort they tried 
artificial insemination - a fertility treatment which places washed 
sperm directly into the uterus - but with no success.

They then turned to in vitro fertilization and were surprised to discover that it worked first time.

However, their surprise turned to horror as the doctor revealed they had 'two strong embryos.'

Under fire: Many readers deemed the couple 'ungrateful', 'selfish' and 'irresponsible'

Mr Garland said that they felt 'pissed', 'terrified', 'angry', 'guilty', and ‘regretful’ at the news.

'[It was me] and my wife’s nightmare,' he added.

While Mrs Garland recalled: 'We were pregnant with twins - twin boys, we’d find out later. In my mind I had done nothing less than ruin our family.'

'We brought this on ourselves. This is what we wanted - now it's our worst nightmare'

She then bemoaned the physical effects of twin pregnancy.

'[It] has
slowed me down and I can’t care for my son the way I used to.

'I feel like s*** pretty much all of the time physically . . . I can’t 
get on the floor, I can’t bend over, I can’t pick him up, I can’t run 
after him.

'During my first singleton pregnancy I was working out, working 
full time, taking a class at night, and keeping up with many of the 
household responsibilities.'

In the lab: In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a process by which an egg is fertilized by sperm outside the body and implanted in the woman's uterus

Despite the Garlands' articles triggering a torrent of criticism there was a small majority who 
seemed to sympathize with how the expectant parents were feeling.

One father wrote on CNN: 'My wife and I are in the EXACT same position right now (she's on bed rest and due in a couple months). 

'Couldn't get pregnant, tried IUI's, 
had miscarriages, transferred two embryos since the odds were low and . .
. then BAM, both embryos 'stuck.' What the ???

'This
whole process has torn us apart. I'm ecstatic to be having twins, she's
terrified and wishes things had worked out differently. So I understand
this couple's mixed feelings. I am there.'

And a mother-of-twins offered some words of encouragement: 'You will make it work and you will love 
these children.

'I promise you if you pull through the first year together as a
team you will be the strongest kind of family there can be, and nothing
can stop you from there!'

Mrs Garland however, says that she doesn't want to read any message boards telling her how joyful twins are.

'None of this makes me feel any better. Quite frankly, it just 
pisses me off,' she concludes.

Multiple
births are an increasingly common outcome for couples using fertility 
treatments, according to the American College of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists.

Its 
website states: 'A woman undergoing IVF has an approximate 22-fold 
increased risk of conceiving a twin pregnancy and a 100-fold increased 
risk of conceiving a triplet pregnancy, as compared with natural 
conception.

About 48,000 IVF babies are born each year in the U.S.
