A couple who claimed £50,000 in false benefits by pretending to split up were caught after going on a secret second honeymoon - to celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary.

Nicola Harrison, 51, and Dean Harrison, 52, from Maerdy, South Wales, pretended their marriage was over so they could claim benefits as single parents for more than 10 years.

But a court heard the brazen pair remained lovers and even went on the 'second honeymoon' to Scotland just weeks before they were caught.

Nicola Harrison, 51, and her husband Dean, 52, from Maerdy, South Wales, were exposed as benefit fraudsters after an anonymous tip-off. The pair had pretended to split up, but had actually been on holiday to celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary

Their ten-year scam - from which they pocketed £52,489 - was finally brought to an end by an anonymous tip-off.

Dean Harrison has now been jailed for ten months - the second time he has been jailed for benefit fraud.

His wife, who was said to be 'under his influence', was give a five-month prison sentence, suspended for two years. 

The pair offered to start repaying the money on a voluntary basis and have so far repaid £245.

But no court order was made for the rest of the money to be repaid.

Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard the fraud began when the recruitment company worker pretended he lived with his mother after being released from jail. He had been jailed for benefit fraud, the court heard.

But prosecutor Kayleigh Simmons told the court how the pair had actually been reunited.

She said: 
'They claimed their relationship was purely platonic but there was 
evidence of a “shared household” despite both saying their marriage was 
over.

'The couple also holidayed together in February 2012 in Scotland for what was a celebration of their wedding anniversary.'

The pair appeared in court and pleaded guilty to benefit fraud between 2002 to 2012.

Jeremy Jenkins, defending Nicola Harrison, said: 'Since being in prison the marriage has been somewhat unconventional.'

Judge Philip Richards told Dean Harrison said: 'I have no doubt that you were the principle architect of this fraud.

'Your wife was very much under your influence. This was your scheme.'
