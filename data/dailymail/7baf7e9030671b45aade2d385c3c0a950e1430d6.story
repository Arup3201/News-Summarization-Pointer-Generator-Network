Missing: Rebecca Weiss, who co-owned two businesses with her husband, is said to have vanished while diving

The mother of the businesswoman who disappeared on Saturday while free diving in the ocean said her daughter suspected her husband was having an affair.

Rebecca Weiss, 50, did not return home from a diving expedition off the coast of Rancho Palos Verdes in California, in what is now being classed as a murder investigation.

Alan Weiss, 60, reported his wife missing on Saturday evening after he found her personal belongings on the beach and her car parked nearby after she failed to return from a diving trip.

He was the last person to see her alive.

Her mother told KTLA 5 that her daughter confided in her shortly before she disappeared that she suspected her husband was having an affair.

Vilma Causey sad: 'My daughter told me that she found it on the computer...He has a girlfriend.'

As well as this, she said that while they are doing everything they can to find her daughter - including passing out flyers in the area - Alan Weiss has done nothing to help, which the family think is strange.

She said of Weiss's behavior: 'Very bad, very strange. That is 
not the reaction of a person that has somebody missing that is close to 
you.

'Was she the only one on the beach to swim? Especially at that resort? No one saw her? No one saw her??'

Mrs Causey also revealed her daughter's cell phone and keys are missing, but her credit cards and driving license were found.

She was last seen by her husband leaving her condominium in a wetsuit and driving off in her car.

Her brother also said it is hard to believe something could have gone wrong.

'My sister is a strong swimmer, and she was wearing a wetsuit, according to my brother-in-law,' Bob Causey said. 'So it would have to be something out of the extraordinary for something to happen to her out there.'

Free diving is a form of underwater diving that does not involve the use of scuba gear or other external breathing devices.

Instead, it relies on a diver's ability to hold his or her breath until resurfacing.

Danger spot: The Palos Verdes peninsula is a risky place to dive due strong currents and slippery rocks

The couple have been married 20 years
and seemed happy, according to friends, who said they traveled the 
world and enjoyed their diving hobby together.

Homicide
detectives have interviewed Alan Weiss but say he is not considered a 
suspect, though they did turn her disappearance from a missing person investigation to a homicide case.

Rebecca, who is described as being 
5ft 5in tall and weighing 115 pounds, co-owns two grocery 
businesses with her husband.

Her mother Mrs Causey said: 'There has to be somebody who must have seen. This is not an isolated place. This is a resort. There should have been people.'

Her
clothes and other belongings were found near her BMW X5, which was 
parked at the Terennea resort on the Palos Verdes Peninsula, near Los 
Angeles, California.

Mr Weiss told the LA Weekly blog
that his wife was ‘very experienced’ at free-diving, a discipline that 
does not involve using any scuba gear and relies on the ability to hold 
breath for up to three minutes.

Those
who practice it are at risk of blacking out from running out of breath 
and the sport is extremely dangerous without supervision.

The
Palos Verdes beauty spot, which is a short drive from her home in 
Marina Del Rey, is renowned for being very challenging, even to those 
with considerable expertise.

A review of the area on California Diving News warns divers about the dangers of entry and exit.

It
reads: ‘The two main entry points, Long Point and Marineland Cove 
require experience, skill and some luck entering over the slippery 
boulders and constantly changing cobble beach.

‘A
favorite entry point can be washed away with the next high tide. Watch 
the sets of waves. Small steps are required to enter and exit the water 
to avoid falls.’

A Coast 
Guard helicopter, a response boat and a cutter were joined by a Baywatch
Cabrillo crew and an LASD helicopter in an overnight search.

Four divers with Baywatch Marina Del Rey have began sub-surface searches on Sunday and carried on yesterday. They will continue again today.

According to Shareen Ghabrial, who lives above the search area, a sheriff's deputy at Vanderlip Park told neighbors that the woman was a frequent snorkeler.

'On that first night ... it was quite a sight,' she told Marina Del Rey Patch.

'Our homes here were fully illuminated
by the helicopters and the frantic sounds of the workers in their boats
directly below us. It was very busy here and very intense.

'That had continued through the night with just a short break of silence in the early morning.'

Location:The craggy Palos Verdes Peninsula includes a range of stunning cliffs and beaches

Mrs Weiss and her 
husband are recorded as running several businesses, including Alan L. Weiss Inc and 
Specialty Grocery Inc.

The Terannea resort, which is perched at the edge of a cliff is, according to its website, ‘infused with the elegance of a classic Mediterranean estate, the casual energy of coastal Southern California, and countless ways to spend your days – all tied together with authentic, genuine hospitality and a deep respect for this irreplaceable oceanfront setting.’

It includes guest rooms, suites, bungalows, casitas and villas, as well as restaurant, a spa and nine-hole golf course.
