Past it? Car salesman Gary Hawkins was sacked after his employer said he was too old at 52

A car salesman was sacked after being told he was too old - at the age of 52.

Gary Hawkins won a compensation payout for age discrimination after he took legal action against motor dealership giant Carcraft.

The father-of-four had worked at the company for eight months when he lost his job.

He told a Birmingham employment tribunal that a boss at the firm fired him after getting on a ‘high’ from sacking two other employees.

Mr Hawkins claimed he was told by a regional manager at CC Automotive Group Ltd, which trades as Carcraft in Wednesbury, West Midlands, that he was told old for the job.

The employment tribunal backed Mr Hawkins’ claim on Wednesday.

Speaking today at his home in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, Mr Hawkins said: ‘I have struck a blow for middle-aged men and women everywhere.

‘I didn’t even know I wasn’t part of the youth culture until they got rid of me.

‘I believe I was the oldest guy working there and they had about 520 members of staff on all the sites.

He added: ‘The judge said I was the oldest manager and probably one of the oldest staff members.

‘We had a new regional manager take over and he came in and told everybody on the first day if he had to sack everybody to improve the sales then he would.'

He claimed he was sacked at 6pm on a Saturday shortly after two colleagues had been told they no longer had jobs, while another employee left because of how he was being treated.

Mr Hawkins said: ‘It was a two minute conversation. He pulled me to one side and said: “I think you’re too old for my team, you’re sacked.”

‘He liked 20-year-olds he could bully, he didn’t like anybody with an opinion.’

The company denied ageism and claimed Mr Hawkins had failed to motivate his team and had not trained them properly.

But
he denied his work had been below par and stressed there were regular 
team meetings where ways of improving sales were discussed.

The tribunal heard other roles had been offered to Mr Hawkins but the firm admitted other members of staff had lost their jobs.

Tribunal
judge Peter Rose QC also asked the ages of other managers, past and 
present - and it emerged Mr Hawkins had been the oldest in his field.

He has now found a new job as a manager in the car sales industry.

Wife Heather, 48, said: ‘Gary’s definitely not over the hill.

‘He has three daughters and a son and they keep him on his toes.

‘Really, the whole thing has done him a good turn because he’s now got the best job in the world.

‘Out of all this stress, something good has happened - he now gets the time to see his children.

‘He’s at a place where they realise his "softly, softly" approach gets results.

‘It’s not nice having to live off credit-cards. The payout brings us back to where we were.’

Carcraft, which describes ‘the country’s leading used car supermarket’ with 11 showrooms nationwide, has declined to comment.
