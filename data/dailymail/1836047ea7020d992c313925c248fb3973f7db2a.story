Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood said the austerity drive has not gone far enough

It will take at least 20 years before the economy recovers its pre-recession strength, Britain’s top civil servant has warned.

Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood said the austerity drive has not gone far enough and stressed it will continue for years.

He said there was a ‘very long way to go’ before the economy returns to the same level as before the 2007 recession.

‘This is not a two-year project or a five-year project.

'This is a ten-year project, a 20-year  generational battle to beef up the economy in ways that we have not seen for many, many decades,’ he said.

Sir Jeremy’s remarks were made to Civil Service Live, a convention for mandarins in west London.

He told them: ‘There is a very, very long way to go. We were reminded only last week that the economy as a whole remains about 4 per cent below the size that it was in 2008.

‘Five years on from the bottom of the recession we have still not even near recovered all the output we lost in that terribly deep recession that we suffered in 2007-08.

‘Those are really daunting numbers that just show the size of the challenge; there is no alternative.’

He added: ‘There have been years of austerity, years of pay freezes, of pay restraint; every part of government has been told by ministers — and rightly so — to hunt out waste and tackle inefficiencies.

‘But despite all these efforts we have made over the last three years … our debt/GDP ratio is still rising, debt interest payments are rising.

‘There is still an enormous amount of work to get that deficit down to a balanced level to get the debt/GDP level falling rather than rising.’

He also warned that steering the economy away from financial services towards manufacturing was ‘much easier said than done’.

Praise: Sir Jeremy described the new Bank of England governor Mark  Carney as 'the world's most impressive central banker'

His gloomy prediction contrasts with recent market data which showed that UK manufacturing saw its strongest growth in two years in June.

The UK economy also grew by 0.3 per cent  in the first three months of the year.

This week, Bank of England figures also showed the highest mortgage approval rates for three and a half years.

Sir Jeremy had more positive predictions for the new Bank of England governor Mark  Carney. He said the Canadian was ‘the world’s most impressive central banker’.

He added: ‘We will give him every support he needs.’
