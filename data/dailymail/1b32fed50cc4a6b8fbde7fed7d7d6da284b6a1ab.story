Zaha Hadid has said claims her plans for the new stadium resemble a vagina are 'really embarrassing'

The female architect behind designs for the new Al-Wakrah sports stadium has said critics who compared her plans to female genitalia are 'really embarrassing.'

Zaha Hadid has hit back against claims her designs for the stadium, which will host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, resemble a woman's private parts insisting they were inspired by an ancient dhow boat.

Iraqi-born Hadid, who is considered one of the world's best female architects, also suggested the plans would not have faced the same criticism if they were designed by a man.

'It's really embarrassing they come up with nonsense stuff like this.

'What are they saying? Everything with a hole in it is a vagina? That's ridiculous,' she told Time. 

Hadid, who won the prestigious Pritzker 
Architecture Prize in 2004 added 'if a guy had done this project' there 
wouldn't have been the same level of criticism.

The striking design is meant to resemble an ancient dhow boat that Qataris traditionally used for pearl diving.

But when plans were released for a new 45,000-capacity stadium to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup the first reaction was something different entirely.

Inspired by the dhow boat that carried generations of local fishermen and pearl divers, the stadium weaves together Qatar's past with its progressive vision for the future

As Qatar unveiled the stunning blueprints for its new state-of-the-art climate-controlled Al-Wakrah sports stadium, design went viral.

Thousands of fans posted tweets likening it to a woman's private parts - something that was almost certainly unintentional.

The design, topped with a structure 
resembling the sails of a dhow, is meant to tackle the Qatari searing heat and also includes a spectator area outside 
the ground that will be temperature controlled at 30C to 32C.

The
 plan gave no specific details how the cooling system would work, other 
than saying it would incorporate 'shading, aerodynamic and mechanical 
cooling components'.

The
 question of the heat during a summer tournament has been a one of 
several controversies since Qatar was announced as the winner of the bid
 in December 2010.

Players'
 union FIFPro has said it will urge its members not to take part if it 
is played in Qatar's summer, even if air conditioning is installed in 
the stadiums.

Qatar's building projects have also been
 hit by allegations of migrant construction workers not being given 
enough food or water, as well as accusations of corruption over the 
voting procedure to win the bid. Officials have denied the accusations.

The stadium, with a capacity of 40,000 people, is expected to be completed by 2018

'Al-Wakrah is the first of six stadiums already in the latter stages of the design process, our committee has issued 10 major tenders to the market encompassing project and design managers and stadium-operation consultants,' Hassan al-Thawadi, the general secretary of the 2022 committee told reporters.

He said the stadium, with a capacity of 40,000 people, would be completed by 2018, but declined to comment on the cost.

Overall, the tiny gas-rich state plans to spend about $140 billion on a rail system, a new airport, a seaport, and hundreds of kilometers of new roads for the tournament, in addition to the stadiums that will host the matches.

Asked how the committee plans to limit any risk of abuse to workers, al-Thawadi said the committee was dedicated to applying all clauses in its workers' charter to make sure the rights of the workers were going to be respected and upheld.

'If there are any deaths above zero that would be unacceptable for us,' he said.

The Al-Wakrah, which will be built 12 miles south of Doha, is not the only building to have been attracted attention for that reason.

In Chicago the
 Crain Communications Building, which was completed in 1983 with a 
prominent vertical slit in the front, has been dubbed the Vagina 
Building.
