A British man has travelled 8,000 miles around the world refusing to use any motorised transport.

Dave Cornthwaite is hoping to complete 25 expeditions of over 1,000 miles without using motorised transport - and has currently completed eight - breaking eight world records in the process.

The 34-year-old, from Shipston-on-Stour, Warwickshire, quit his graphic designer job at 25 and started adventuring the world in unconventional ways. 

On the open road: Dave used a skateboard to get from Perth to Brisbane. His trip was inspired when he started riding a skateboard around his town and saw the world in a completely different way

An active holiday: He swam the Lower Missouri River as part of his mission to keep his trip free from any motorised help

He was joined by paddle-boaters as he braved the Lower Muissouri

Pedal power: He used his bike car to travel from Memphis to Miami as part of his 8,000-mile long tour

Dave travels along the Mississippi River on his paddleboard. He now holds one world record for the longest journey by stand-up paddleboard

So far he has used a skateboard, kayak, tandem bicycle, paddleboard, sail boat, elliptical bicycle and travelled by simply swimming.

Dave was inspired when he started riding a skateboard around his town and saw the world in a completely different way - he quit his job two weeks later.

Dave said: 'Up until then I literally hadn't thought for a second about what I really wanted to do with my life and all of a sudden I woke up as a completely miserable twenty five year-old.

'I had a job I hated, a mortgage, and a long-term relationship - which wasn't working - and a cat.

Dave kayaks around the Murray River, Australia. The adventurer now holds eight world records - including being the first person to skate the length of Britain

Taking a back seat! Dave used a tamden to cycle from Vancouver to Vegas as part of his global adventure

He used an Elliptigo to go around Western Europe, after leaving his old life behind at 25

The adventurous spirit used a stand up paddleboard to navigate the Mississippi River

The 34-year-old quit his graphic designer job at 25 and started adventuring the world in unconventional ways

'So from that moment I started 
thinking about what I needed to do to start living according to my 
passions, as opposed to expectations.'

The
 adventurer now holds eight world records including being the first 
person to skate the length of Britain, the longest journey by skateboard
 and the longest journey by stand-up paddleboard.

This
 year David will travel on a whike - a three-wheeled recumbent trike 
with a sail - along the length of the Atacama Desert in Chile, cross 
Europe on a form of transport voted for by social media and attempt to 
coastal kitesurf in Brazil.

Dave
 said: 'I just love saying yes and experiencing new things that stretch 
me. My Expedition 1000 project gives me a great framework to search - so
 every time I find a new way to travel without a motor I start thinking 
about how I could travel a great distance with it.

'The
 stand-up paddle boarding the length of the Mississippi will always be 
one of my fondest challenges - it was such a formative journey, taught 
me a great deal and I made so many new friends on the way down that 
river.

'My motivations are 
to make the most of my time so I don't look back with regrets, but the 
most valuable thing that has come of this strange career of mine is that
 my story has given other people the impetus to make changes in their 
own lives.'

Dave skateboarded from Perth to Brisbane as part of his global tour. He was the first person to skate the length of Britain

Dave says his motivations are to make the most of his time so so he doesn't look back with regrets
