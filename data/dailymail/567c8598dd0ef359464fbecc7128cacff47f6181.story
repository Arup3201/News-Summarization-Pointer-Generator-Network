Hollywood's golden girl Reese Witherspoon is seen here in handcuffs following her dramatic arrest in the early hours of Friday morning.

The footage shows the 37-year-old actress being led out of an Atlanta police station in cuffs before being unshackled and taken inside for booking where she made her  ''you're about to find out who I am' comment.

Reese appears in a calm and co-operative demeanor, although the video - obtained by TMZ - serves as another nail in her well-carved squeaky clean image.

Cuffed: Reese Witherspoon seen here in new video footage in handcuffs at an Atlanta police station following her arrest for disorderly conduct in the early hours of Friday morning

The Mud actress was arrested for disorderly conduct last Friday after her husband Jim Toth was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence.

Talent agent Toth, 42, apparently feels 'awful' for getting Reese involved in his arrest and is overwhelmed with guilt.

A source told People: '[Jim] feels awful that he involved Reese in the situation. He made a bad decision and it certainly made things worse that he dragged her into it.

'[He] has to pay the consequences, bottom line. He gets that.'

Jim reached 1.39 on the sobriety test - over Georgia's legal limit of 0.08 - when he and Reese were pulled over in the early hours of the morning and it is thought their 'embarrassing' incident will cause him to look at alcohol in a different way.

The source added: 'Jim has always been a big social drinker. A lot of his job is being social. He's out to lunch or dinner almost every day of the week, schmoozing clients and taking business meetings.

The couple, who have seven-month-old son Tennessee together, have been given bail until their court hearing on May 22.

Reese
 - who also has children Ava, 13, and son Deacon, 10, with ex-husband

Referring to disrespectful comments 
to authorities, which allegedly included the statement 'you're about to 
find out who I am', she said:

'Out of respect for the ongoing legal situation, I cannot comment on everything that is being reported right now.

'But I do want to say I clearly had one drink too many and I am deeply embarrassed about the things I said.

'I have nothing but respect for the police and I am very sorry for my behaviour.'

Meanwhile, Reese's friend Chelsea Handler told Entertainment Tonight that the actress was 'doing fine.'

'She was just trying to protect her husband, so,' she said. 'I mean everybody makes mistakes, so it's not a big deal.'

Chelsea met up with Reese, her husband and a group of friends including Cameron Diaz, Michael Keaton, Judd Apatow, and Leslie Mann -  two days after the couple's arrest.

According to Us Weekly, the couple joined their friends at the Greenwich Hotel in New York City.

Reese began dating Jim in early February 2010, three years after her divorce from actor Ryan Phillippe with who she has two children.

Jim and Reese married in Ojai, California in March 2011.
