A California man took his car to an auto repair shop, but instead of a standard receipt, the man received a nasty note from the mechanic.

After getting a car repair at George Fritts Auto Repair in Riverside, Ruben Rodriguez saw a note from George Fritts himself on the receipt: 'Customer to stupid to understand normal thinking.'

'I saw the words ‘stupid’ and I just kind of was like, ‘What?’ And I read it and reread it,' Rodriguez told CBS Los Angeles.

But Rodriguez wasn't mistaken. 

Nasty Note: Ruben Rodriguez (above) took his car to George Fritts Auto Repair in Riverside, and instead of a standard receipt, the man received a nasty note from the mechanic

'To Stupid': The bottom of the note reads: 'Customer advised again about keeping oil clean. Customer to stupid to understand normal thinking'

Rodriguez told KCAL that he was previously advised by Fritts to keep his car oil clean, but he didn't know how to do so and that was his question. He said he received the insulting note Tuesday when he asked Fritts about some previous work done to his car at the shop. 

Though the insult may have caught Rodriguez off guard, KHITS reports that Rodriguez was quick to point out the mechanic's improper use of the word 'to' in his note.

Fritts should have written 'too' instead of 'to.'

Error: After reading the note, Rodriguez went back into the repair shop and pointed out the mechanic's grammatical error

Opinion: Fritts gave little comment on the record, but said that he stands by his opinion of Rodriguez

Rodriguez told KCAL that was one of the issues he pointed out when he went back into the shop after receiving the nasty note.  

'I don’t think he was too excited about that,' Rodriguez said, 'but I did my best to help him out.'

Though Rodriguez may have one-upped the owner, Fritts told KCAL that he stands by his opinion of Rodriguez 

'If he had the nerve enough or [is] proud enough to write this on paper, then who else has he told and talked to this way?' Rodriguez said. 'So I just felt that if you were treated this way by him he shouldn't get away with it.'

Rodriguez isn't the only one offended by the mechanic's conduct. Since the incident, the shop's Facebook page has been riddled with reviews from those displeased with Fritts' behavior.
