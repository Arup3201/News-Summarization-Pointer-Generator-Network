Charles Saatchi has launched a furious attack on socialite journalist Taki Theodoracopulos after the columnist used his Spectator column to stand up for Nigella Lawson.

The controversial billionaire told Taki that his ex-wife 'always found you toe-curlingly vile' in a bizarre open letter to the magazine which has now resulted in the 77-year-old offering to take on Mr Saatchi in a cage fight.

The art dealer's outburst came after Taki wrote that Mr Saatchi, 70, was a 'coward' and a 'rogue', criticising the way he treated his celebrity chef ex-wife.

The advertising mogul, now one of the world's leading art dealers, made headlines last year when he was pictured apparently throttling Ms Lawson at a restaurant.

The pair divorced shortly afterwards, and the chef has since accused her ex-husband of being controlling and jealous during their decade-long marriage.

Mr Saatchi claimed that Ms Lawson was a habitual cocaine user, an allegation he later withdrew, during a court case which laid bare the tensions in their relationship and prompted David Cameron to come out in support of the TV personality.

In his Spectator column last week, Taki compared Mr Saatchi unfavourably to notorious porn baron Al Goldstein, saying he was a 'coward' who had a 'bullying manner - against women, that is'.

The columnist added: 'Expecting a pornographer to have a heart is like counting upon Charles Saatchi to act like a gentleman.

'The art world is full of rogues and pirates, and in my book the heroic man who grabbed Nigella by the throat is both of these things, and he is most welcome to come and try to grab my little throat anytime.'

Mockery: The Spectator compared the feud to new film Grudge Match, which is about a pair of elderly boxers

Controversy: The row started when Taki stood up for Mr Saatchi's ex-wife Nigella Lawson

Dear Ms Taki,

Although the Spectator is a lovely read, I always skip your column, I’m afraid.

I am simply not interested in your social life.  I know that you delight in telling readers that your friends of Prussian nobility find you hilariously entertaining company at their  swanky Europoncy parties.

But it was very hapless of you to spring to Nigella’s defence last week, as she always found you toe-curlingly vile, and would have been aghast at having you as her valiant supporter.

People tell me that in your unreadable column you also like to brag that you are a Black Belt at karate. Well, me too, old boy. But apparently your ‘fights’ are genteel affairs, against other soppy geriatrics rolling around the floor in crisp white outfits, in some bit of judokai nonsense.

Mine take place in cages, 20 feet square, unofficial little events with no gloves, no rules, and the loser being carried out, usually battered to bits. You will understand why I laughed out loud at your schoolyard boast that I should try throttling a real hard case like you.

Yours,Charles Saatchi

In response, Mr Saatchi sent an open letter to the magazine in which he claimed that Ms Lawson - whose brother Dominic and father Nigel both edited the Spectator - disliked Taki and would be 'aghast' to have him on her side.

'It was very hapless of you to spring
 to Nigella's defence last week, as she always found you toe-curlingly 
vile, and would have been aghast at having you as her valiant 
supporter,' he wrote.

He also mocked Taki's fighting ability and boasted about his own martial prowess.

'People tell me that in your unreadable column you also like to brag that you are a black belt at karate,' he wrote. 'Well, me too, old boy.

'But apparently your "fights" are genteel affairs, against other soppy geriatrics rolling around the floor in crisp white outfits, in some bit of judokai nonsense.

'Mine take place in cages, 20 feet square, unofficial little events with no gloves, no rules, and the loser being carried out, usually battered to bits. You will understand why I laughed out loud at your schoolyard boast that I should try throttling a real hard case like you.'

Taki, a multi-millionaire with homes in New York, London and Switzerland, responded bullishly to Mr Saatchi's boasts.

'I am 77 years old, 5ft 9in and weigh 
185lbs,' he writes in his column this week. 'I am willing to face him 
any time under cage-fighting non-rules, which will be a first for me. I 
need three days' notice.'

Spectator editor Fraser Nelson likened the feud to new film Grudge Match, which sees Sylvester Stallone and Robert de Niro play ageing boxers who are coaxed out of retirement to fight each other.

He added: 'If Taki and Charles are serious, we'd be happy to stage the contest in the garden of the Spectator, with proceeds from the ticket sales going to The Boxing Academy in East London.'

Political strategist John McTernan tweeted: 'Charles Saatchi seeks to correct his public image by offering to give a 77-year old man a beating. He should be in PR.'

Taki, who runs his own magazine as well as writing for the Spectator, has attracted his own fair share of controversy over the past few decades.

He has repeatedly been accused of racism, anti-Semitism and fascist sympathies, although his editors have always claimed that his outspoken views are what makes him popular with readers.
