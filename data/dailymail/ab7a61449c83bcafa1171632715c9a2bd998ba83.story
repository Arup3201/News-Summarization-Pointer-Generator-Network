Further tests have been ordered on the body of Gareth Williams, the 25-year-old father-of one, who may be the first victim of a major UK measles epidemic.

Mr Williams was found dead in his flat in Port Tennant, Swansea, South Wales, one week ago.

A post-mortem examination to establish the cause of his death has proved inclusive, the Swansea Coroner's Office confirmed today.

'The results were inconclusive and further tests have now to be carried out,' a spokesman said.

The measles epidemic, centred on Swansea, showed no sign of slowing today as the latest figures for the area were released.

Measles cases in the region have jumped by 56 in the last two days as the headline total reached 942.

Worst hit are children and teenagers aged 10 to 18 who missed out on the vital measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab when they were younger.

That was due to unfounded fears that the three-in-one vaccination was somehow linked to autism in children.

Meanwhile, a major £20 million programme to vaccinate one million children and teenagers across England has been announced.

It has been prompted by fears that the epidemic in Wales could spread across the border into England.

In common with Wales, a large number of people missed out on the MMR jab and are unprotected against the spread of the disease.

In both cases unfounded fears the three-in-one jab was linked to autism in children was responsible for the drop in vaccination uptake.

Public Health Wales (PHW) today urged teenagers preparing to sit crucial GCSE and A-level exams to ensure they are vaccinated.

Major efforts to vaccinate thousands of children and young adults who missed out in the past are still under way.

Weekend drop-in clinics held in a handful of hospitals in the region have seen thousands of anxious parents attending with their children.

An urgent in-school vaccination programme has also been going on in parallel to ensure children are protected against the disease.

The outbreak in Swansea is one of the biggest to have hit the UK in the last decade.

Fears the disease could spread to 
England have triggered a major catch-up vaccination programme targeting 
one million children and teenagers.

The £20 million programme will see GP surgeries, schools and community programmes used as vaccination centres.

The campaign will target children and young people who have not had either one or two doses of the MMR jab.

The scheme comes after Public Health England (PHE) revealed there were 587 confirmed measles cases in the first three months of this year in England.

That is more than three times the 168 cases in the same period of 2012.

A major vaccination programme continues unabated in Wales which has so far seen 83 people admitted to hospital due to the illness since the outbreak.

Although the outbreak is centred mainly on Swansea, rates of measles are high throughout the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University, Powys and Hywel Dda health board areas, especially in Neath Port Talbot and North Powys.

Health officials have also launched a nationwide programme to help stem the measles outbreak and prevent it spreading more widely across the UK.

At least a million children and teenagers are to be vaccinated against measles in an attempt to stop expected outbreaks in England.

Some will never have had a jab, while others have only had the first of two doses of the MMR vaccine.

The £20million campaign follows a big rise in cases in South Wales, where public health officials have been running clinics to increase protection rates.
