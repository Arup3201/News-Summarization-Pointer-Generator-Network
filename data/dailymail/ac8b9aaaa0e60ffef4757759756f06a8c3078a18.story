A senior judge has demanded to know why a Lithuanian child-rapist was let into Britain, where he went on to rape a woman.

Lady Justice Hallett questioned whether serious offenders were allowed to simply ‘walk into the country’.

In Britain, Victor Akulic subjected his victim to a horrendous ordeal, beating her repeatedly before raping her.

The paedophile even filmed the rape, and then forced the woman to give evidence, during which she had to watch the footage of the assault.

At the Court of Appeal yesterday, the judge demanded to know how he got into the country.

She asked: ‘He comes into this country with a conviction for raping a child. Do we let in just anyone, even if they have such a serious conviction?’

In
June last year Polish burglar Kuba Dlugosz was convicted of 
manslaughter after he bound and gagged a helpless pensioner before 
ransacking her home and leaving her to die of hypothermia.

Eveline Kelmenson, 83, suffered a 
slow and painful death after she was stripped of gold jewellery and 
abandoned in her nightclothes. She was found dead in her North London 
home on New Year's Dad 2009.

Dlugosz slipped through police hands weeks before the killing.
He was arrested twice for burglary 
but officers did not discover he was wanted on a European arrest warrant
because he gave them a false name.

Fingerprint checks that would have 
revealed he was a dangerous career criminal who had escaped from a 
Polish prison the previous year were not carried out.

Six years after an Albanian court 
sentenced him in his absence to 20 years jail, British police tracked 
down Imer Hoxha to an address in East London.

Using the fake Kosovan name of Imer Beq Hasani, he had claimed asylum in the UK as a victim of the Balkans War.

The false ID allowed him to move 
freely in the UK, until police raided his house when they suspected his 
son had committed a burglary.

Akulic’s barrister, Catherine Purnell, told her he was allowed into Britain because Lithuania is in the EU. 

The judge replied: ‘I appreciate that, but do we have to take in anybody, even if they have a conviction for raping a child?’ 

The case prompted questions about the extent of checks on EU nationals who come to Britain.

Akulic, 44, had been jailed for nine years in July 2001 after raping a seven-year-old whom he lured into his house with lemonade.

After the assault, he threatened to kill her if she reported it. A decade earlier, he had been jailed for seven years for a serious assault.

He beat his girlfriend, breaking her nose, and then locked her in a room for two weeks. He also served two years for burglary.

After his release from a Lithuanian jail in 2009, he came to the UK and settled in Sheerness, Kent.

The following year he attacked a woman, leaving her ‘horribly disfigured and in pain’. He then forced her to perform a sex act on him, and filmed the assault.

At his trial at Maidstone Crown Court he pleaded not guilty to common assault, rape and intimidation, which forced the woman to give evidence against him.

Commenting on Akulic’s defence tactics, Judge Martin Joy said: ‘She must have felt utterly humiliated and she was certainly visibly distressed. The photographs of the victim are unforgettable.

‘Anybody who has to assess the seriousness of these offences could not do so without seeing what that woman looked like as you raped her – black eyes, bruises to her face, shoulders, arms, legs, all around. It is horrific and it demonstrates how depraved you are.’

Akulic was jailed for life with a minimum sentence of eight and a half years, but appealed.

Yesterday the Court of Appeal handed him an indeterminate sentence for public protection and reduced his minimum jail term to seven years. He will be let out only when the Parole Board is satisfied he is no longer a threat.

Akulic had appealed his sentence at the London Criminal Appeals Court after he was handed a life jail term last year

The Home Office said Akulic did not appear on a ‘watch list’ of criminals and terror suspects. As a result border staff were not aware of his convictions when he arrived.

The UK Border Agency said: ‘We check all passengers entering the UK against watch lists but we rely on overseas police to inform us of conviction information which did not happen in this case.’

It is the latest in a string of cases where foreign criminals have committed serious offences in the UK after being allowed in.

Last year, for example, Intars Pless, 34, a convicted axe killer from Latvia, was jailed for ten years after mowing down and killing moped rider Valentina Planciunene in Boston, Lincolnshire.

An APPEAL Court judge yesterday condemned the immigration ‘merry-go-round’ that allowed an asylum seeker to stay in Britain for more than a decade.

The Pakistani was allowed to make 16 appeals or new applications despite being repeatedly rejected, at a cost to taxpayers of at least £250,000.

Lord Justice Ward: ‘Here we have one of those whirligig cases where an asylum seeker goes up and down on the merry-go-round leaving one wondering when the music will ever stop. It is a typical case where asylum was refused years ago but endless fresh claims clog the process of removal.’

The 38-year-old man, whose identity was hidden by the court, arrived in Britain in August 1998. The Court of Appeal rejected his latest appeal – over the High Court’s decision to reject his demand for judicial review of a decision to remove him – and ruled he should now be returned to Pakistan.

Lord Justice Ward said: ‘It is time the music stopped and the merry-go-round stops turning.’
