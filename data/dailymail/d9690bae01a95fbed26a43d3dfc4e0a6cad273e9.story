In an age where games focus on showcasing feats of graphical accomplishment, it's refreshing when a series pumps all its energy into gameplay.

Enter Just Dance 4, the latest of the successful saga where players mimic dance moves that appear on screen - scoring points related to their accuracy.

Colourful: The game boasts a wonderful artistic style, backed up with fun gameplay. Some may find, however, that is too similar to the other Just Dance games.

Thankfully, Ubisoft have ensured there are plenty of songs worth dancing to. Classics such as Elvis Presley's Jailhouse Rock feature, while newer pop hits from the likes of One Direction and Flo Rida ensure plenty of variation. Some songs, however, are covers, and this can jar with the overall high-quality feel of the game.

All of the songs are available from the start, with unlockable playlists, alternative dance routines and more attainable with sufficient mojo - the game's equivalent of experience points.

Immediately noticeable is just how well the game works with the Kinect. Often navigating menus in this way is cumbersome, but Just Dance's virtual hand works wonderfully, letting you jump from track to track with minimum interruption.

Gameplay is strong, too. Best played with friends, there are a number of songs with dance routines tailored to up to four players. Dance Battle sees two dancers battle through a series of songs, each with their own health bar, which diminishes when they lose a round.

Dance Mash Up allows you take on routines from the previous games, using the updated track list.

But the real star of the show is the Just Sweat mode. Here, calories as counted as you dance to the tracks, telling you how many have been burned.

There are pre-made workouts, but you can also make your own - enhancing longevity, and providing an attractive option for those scared off by workout-specific games.

This is made all the more enjoyable with the game's wonderful, cartoon-esque visuals. It's a shame, then, that Just Dance 4 may leave some wanting more.

Ubisoft have promised plenty of downloadable content, however, the game simply emulates its predecessors' recipe, without adding any new ingredients - new game modes, for example.

But why change a winning formula? For this remains a brilliant family game...and a perfect stocking filler this Christmas.
