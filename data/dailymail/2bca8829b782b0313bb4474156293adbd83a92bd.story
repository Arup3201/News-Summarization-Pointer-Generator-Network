Juan Mata and Ashley Young got into the Christmas spirit ahead of Manchester United's eagerly anticipated clash with Liverpool on Sunday. 

The duo both featured in United's 2-1 victory over Southampton at St Mary's on Monday night. 

That result that saw Louis van Gaal's side move up to third in the Premier League standings.

United couldn't have wished for a better time to play their arch rivals at Old Trafford. 

Brendan Rodgers' side, still without the attacking talents of Daniel Sturridge, currently occupy ninth place and crashed out of the Champions League on Wednesday after their draw with Basle at Anfield. 

Still, Mata and Young will not be complacent as United look to end give themselves the perfect early Christmas gift with a win over Liverpool.
