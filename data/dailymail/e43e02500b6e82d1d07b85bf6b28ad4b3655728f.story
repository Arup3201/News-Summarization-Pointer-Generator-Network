Holiday camp chain Butlins has announced a major refurbishment.

Best known for its 1950s 'Hi-de-Hi' image, the company is looking to leave the past behind with a £16m investment in new 'mum-friendly' chalets.

Working with Mumsnet, Butlins consulted the site on its design plans, which will be installed at its Minehead holiday centre in Somerset.

Holiday camp chain, Butlins, has just announced a £16m investment into new 'mum-friendly' chalets

Mumsnet consulted on these new bedroom designs at the Butlins Ocean Hotel in Bognor Regis

There will be 117 chalets, which are due to open next April.

The expenditure is Butlins' biggest in 2015 and follows a £2m upgrade this year at Minehead and its holiday centres at Bognor Regis in West Sussex and Skegness in Lincolnshire. 

The plans also include Just For Tots breaks, which include the new Bear Care service - which involves youngsters checking in toys to a hotel desk so they won't be lost on days out.

Bourne Leisure head of travel trade Neil Davies said the design was selected after consulting with users on the parenting website.

Butlins was founded by Billy Butlin in the 1930s with the aim of providing affordable holidays for ordinary families in the UK, after a particularly terrible holiday taken as a child to Barry Island.

Ten camps were built between 1936 and 1966, but many operations closed by the 1990s following a change in holiday demands.

Three camps still operate today - Bognor Regis, Minehead and Skegness - though it is the Minehead location that will benefit from the multi-million pound chalet refurbishment.

Butlins is widely known for this particular type of accommodation, which was originally the only way to stay in their camps and consisted of long lines of single bedrooms in blocks.

Today, each site offers family-fun activities, organised by Redcoats (Butlins staff named after their signature attire), including a Splash Waterworld water park at each location.

He added: 'We have worked with the Mumsnet website to consult with mums on a number of the design features, features, furnishing and surrounding area, thus attempting to ensure they meets the needs and wishes of hard-working families.

'We asked questions to 1,000 of their members - on everything from what would surprise them on a family break through to their concerns about what gets in the way of quality time.

'They consulted on everything from how many TVs there should be through to shaping outside areas with tranquil lakes and outdoor spaces to help kids make friends.'

Chalets will also include arts and crafts equipment and board games to ensure that rain never gets in the way of play time.  

'We have gone back on what made us great to draw inspiration for this new development,' the spokesman added.

'The chalets will be as lovable as they've always been and will hopefully surprise people who have a view of Butlins as being old fashioned - they represent a truly modern shift in family breaks.'

The 2015 investment was announced in the Slovenian capital of Ljubljana where the annual convention of UK travel association Abta is taking place. 

Now in it's second year, the VisitEngland project has generated a total of £517.9m additional spending by UK residents on trips in their own country.

VisitEngland is supported by a nearly £20m grant from the government.

The initiative has also helped to create 9,620 additional jobs in the tourism industry. 

Strategy and development director of VisitEngland, Louise Steward said: 'It is rewarding and encouraging to see the campaign succeed in boosting the visitor economy, creating jobs and inspiring people to take a holiday in England.' 

The Butlins holiday camp in Skegness was one of the first to open its doors - in 1936

In 1976, there were ten different Butlins properties in operation, including the Margate Hotel

Meanwhile, the continuing warm weather in the UK has led to a big jump in autumn seaside resort bookings, according to Expedia.co.uk.

Bookings for the East Sussex resort of Eastbourne are up 112 per cent for September and October compared with the same period last year, while bookings for Scarborough in Yorkshire are up 109 per cent.

There have also been big rises in bookings for Blackpool, which is up 76 per cent, Torquay in Devon, up 60 per cent, and Bournemouth in Dorset, up 48 per cent.

The top beach destinations for September and October are Blackpool, Brighton and Bournemouth.
