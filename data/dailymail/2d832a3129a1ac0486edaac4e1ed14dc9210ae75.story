The vaccination costs £75 with each child needing at least four doses. Campaigners are urging the Government Advisory Committee for Vaccination to include it in NHS care

Campaigners are calling for a vaccine against the leading cause of deadly bacterial meningitis to be offered free on the NHS.

Bexsero is the first jab to protect against meningitis B, but it is available only privately. 

The Government’s advisory committee on vaccination has so far refused to endorse it for routine use, saying it is not cost effective. It costs £75 a dose and children require four each, costing between £400 and £500 in total. 

Meningitis Now, the UK’s largest meningitis charity, said it welcomed 
the move, but wants every baby to have it free on the NHS, instead of 
only being available to those who can afford it.

The UK has one of 
the highest Meningitis B incidence rates in the world - affecting an 
average of 1,870 people each year - and the disease can kill in hours.

Anyone
can get the strain, with one in 10 people affected dying and one in 
three survivors suffering life-changing after-effects such as limb loss,
brain damage and epilepsy.

It kills more children under five than 
any other infectious disease in the UK, while teenagers are also more at
risk than other age groups.

Some experts estimated its use on the 
NHS would have saved 60-80 lives this year alone, while others fear 
rejection of the jab will be a severe setback for vaccine research.

Meningitis
Now founder Steve Dayman MBE, who launched his fight against the deadly
disease after losing his baby Spencer to meningitis in 1982, said ‘The 
availability of the lifesaving vaccine in the UK is a watershed moment 
in the fight against the deadly disease.

‘The vaccine is one of the 
most significant leaps forward in the fight - it’s taken decades to 
develop and stands to save thousands of lives and spare so much misery.

‘We
welcome that it is now available privately, but believe every parent 
should have the choice and chance to vaccinate their baby - not just 
those with means.

‘Universal vaccination is the best way to stop the disease.

‘We
must also consider herd immunity, when a large proportion of people are
vaccinated, it removes a great chunk of the disease and helps to 
protect those who haven’t had the vaccine.’

Campaigners claim, in 
extreme cases, it can cost £3million in support and treatment for each survivor of the disease. 

Campaigners are calling for the treatment to become routine throughout the NHS

Figures earlier this year showed £28million was paid out in compensation
to the families of children left permanently disabled by meningitis 
missed by GPs between 2008 and 2012.

Sue Davie, chief executive of the charity, said ‘We are asking the Government to not only consider costs of treating the disease, but the cost of bereavement support for families and after-care for survivors from prosthetic limbs to lifelong support through school and adult life.’

The vaccine Bexsero is licensed for infants aged two months and over - babies being most susceptible during the first year of life - and older children.

It has taken 20 years to develop the jab using a revolutionary new approach against a range of disease-causing strains.Bexsero has been tested in more than 7,500 patients including infants, toddlers, adolescents and adults across the world.

Studies show most vaccinated infants and teenagers develop a strong immune response.

Novartis offered earlier this year to make the vaccine available at cost to the NHS, which is understood to be far lower than the price on the private market.

Andrin Oswald, Division Head, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, said ‘While we are delighted that MenB disease is now vaccine preventable in the UK, it is our belief that the greatest public health benefit can be achieved through the introduction of the vaccine onto the National Immunisation Programme.

‘We hope that the Department of Health will make the vaccine universally available as soon as possible.
