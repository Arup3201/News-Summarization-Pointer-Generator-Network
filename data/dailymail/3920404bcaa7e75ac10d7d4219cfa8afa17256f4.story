Mo Farah claimed yet another slice of British athletics history by breaking Steve Ovett's two-mile record in his first competition on a home track for 12 months.

Farah, 31, grimaced as he ran against the clock, hunting a time set 36 years ago. The crowd at Birmingham's Alexander Stadium rose to applaud as he ran alone for the final three laps, having left his competition for dust. 

There was no Ovett-inspired waving to the crowd down the home straight but Farah soaked up the adoration afterwards, kissing the track and performing a lap of honour.

Employing the devastating pace he usually reserves for more competitive races, Farah blitzed a 56-second final lap, crossing the line in trademark style with his arms spread wide. His time of 8min 7.85sec obliterated Ovett's previous European record of 8:13.51.

'I really wanted that one,' said Farah. 'As I got into it I felt better and better. I looked at the clock and thought 'you can do it'. The crowd definitely made the difference, they kept pushing me and I wanted to give something back to them.'

There is double the reason to celebrate in the Farah household with a birthday party planned for twin daughters Aisha and Amani, who were two yesterday.

'We'll have a tea party and a bouncy castle,' said Farah, 'but I'll have to check with Alberto (Salazar, Farah's coach) to check if I can go on the bouncy castle, maybe if I take off my shoes.'

Numerous setbacks this year, including four days in hospital and a disappointing marathon debut, have prompted Farah to discuss a time when he can leave behind the demands of elite sport to spend more time with his young family.

It has, Farah admitted, been his toughest year. But in the past fortnight he has still managed to win double European gold and set his eighth British record, which bodes well for his second tilt at the Great North Run in two weeks.

Strain: The Brit pushed himself hard to break the record despite being practically unchallenged in the race

'I think I'll be able to come back stronger and more determined for the Great North Run,' he said. 'It will be about winning the race and finishing my season on a high. Getting ill and getting beaten has made me more determined than ever.'

The British team, which produced their best ever European Championships performance this month, arrived in the Midlands with high expectations after performance director Neil Black promised they were poised to 'go global'. 

Ten of the medallists from Zurich were in action. Of them, only Farah, who won double gold, and silver medallist Lynsey Sharp truly delivered on Black's rally cry.

Sharp has been running with open wounds, both literally and figuratively, all season but ran an astute 800metres, beating a top class field in 1:59.14. The 24-year-old, who was devastated after missing out on European gold, broke away to beat to beat world and Commonwealth champion Eunice Jepkoech Sum of Kenya.

After two unsuccessful operations on a troublesome left heel, Sharp is 'having nightmares' about going under the knife again at the end of September.

Celebration: The Scot looks delighted with her win, which rounds off an excellent few weeks 

'The surgery site never healed,' she said. 'I have to keep it open because if it closes, the infection can't get out and it swells up. I have a suction pack which I put on every day to suck the bad stuff out. It's pretty nasty.

'We're having rows about the recovery time. They're saying four months, I'm saying six weeks.'

Sharp only resumed training in May and has twice run personal bests this season. 'It's exciting to think about what I could do when fully fit,' she said. 'People are talking about Kelly Holmes's British record of 1:56.20. That's a big difference from what I'm running now but hopefully the times will come.' 

European one-lap champion Martyn Rooney came a respectable third in the 400m, behind Grenada's Olympic Champion Kirani James. He has spent the week making up for lost time by planning for his wedding to former British pole vault champion Kate Dennison.

'I'm checking the right people are invited and sitting on the right tables,' he said. 'I've been away for three months so Kate's been amazing doing everything. I proposed and went straight to South Africa the next day so I've dodged a lot of the preparation.'

Christine Ohuruogu, who missed out on a medal in Zurich, won the women's 400m in 51.40.
