Held: Veniamin Konstantinovich Balika, 34, was arrested after detectives found a truck he was driving with roughly $200,000 worth of stolen Muenster cheese

Most crimes are unpleasant but this one most definitely stinks.

When detectives stopped a truck being driven through New Jersey they were left stunned to discover it contained about $200,000 worth of stolen cheese.

Veniamin Konstantinovich Balika, 34, of Plainfield, Illinois, was arrested by police officers at a service area off the New Jersey Turnpike.

He is alleged to have provided false paperwork to the distributor of K&K Cheese in Cashton so he could get the Muenster cheese loaded onto his 18-wheel truck last week.

Speaking to Channel3000.com, Kevin Everhart, general manager of K&K, said: 'This is the first time this has ever happened to us.

'The trucking company we contract with will take care of the money we lost, but it's still a shame.'

The huge cheese load was initially supposed to go to Texas but was instead intercepted thousands of miles away by the New Jersey state police.

K&K - which operates under the Old Country Cheese Factory label, processes 120,000 pounds of milk every day and ships Amish cheese all over the U.S.

It is alleged that Balika was looking to sell the cheese to retailers on the east coast.

The cheese will now be inspected by health authorities and if found safe will be donated to charity.

Stinker: Detectives say the truck contained $200,000 worth of stolen Muenster cheese which was supposed to be going to Texas. This is a file picture of Muenster cheese

Theft: The cheese was taken from K&K - which operates under the Old Country Cheese Factory label. This is one of its factories

Because K&K cannot guarantee that the cheese has not been tampered with, it has not asked for the product back.

Detective Oliver Sissman said this was the first time the force had found stolen cheese. But he knew immediately where it had come from.

'When I looked inside and saw stolen cheese, I thought, of course it's from Wisconsin.' he said.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
