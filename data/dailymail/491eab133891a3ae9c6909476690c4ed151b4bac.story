She won Miss World ten years ago but Rosanna Davidson is showing she is still worthy of winning a bikini round.

Chris de Burgh's daughter, 29, is holidaying with friends in Marbella and was pictured relaxing by the pool in a tiny bikini on Friday.

Wearing a stylish woven trilby and reflective aviator sunglasses, Rosanna sipped on a cool beverage as she strutted around in a hot pink laser cut two-piece.

She had her long blonde hair styled into relaxes beachy waves and wore minimal make-up.

The stunning blonde won the oldest and most coveted beauty contest in 2003, the first and only Irish winner ever.

While she has rock-hard abs and her jaw-dropping physique is near perfect, the model showed no woman is immune of the odd thigh dimple.

She took a seat with her group of friends on a comfortable white sofa bed and the group chatted and laughed.

The pageant winner has enjoyed being one half of Ireland's golden couple for seven years with fiance Wesley Quirke, 30.

She was thrilled when Quirke, a model, businessman and son of a multimillionaire entrepreneur, proposed on January 6.

Quirke got down on one knee at the beginning of the new year with a ring rumoured to be worth around £32,000.

The couple had been holidaying at Le
Saint Géran Hotel on the island of Mauritius, where the Davison family 
have holidayed every Christmas and New Year for the past 18 years.

The couple, dubbed Wesanna by the 
media, met in 2006 in Sandyford nightclub Club 92 and they started 
dating not long after when he cheekily approached her via Bebo, the 
social-networking site.

For the first few years of their 
relationship, they were the darlings of the social scene. Whether it 
was  taking a helicopter to the Galway Races or attending black-tie ball
at the Shelbourne, they rarely missed a photo opportunity.
