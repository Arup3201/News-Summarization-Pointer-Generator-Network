Photos taken 100 years ago of British Tommies preparing for the First World War have been brought to life after they were digitally coloured.

The vivid snaps are in stark contrast to the grainy black and white photographs depicting the Great War that we are used to seeing.

Most of them were taken in July 1914 and show soldiers getting battle-ready at training camps in the Home Counties.

Others depict the men dressed in their smart green uniforms on parade in a town square on the eve of war and then stood on a train station platform as they begin their journey to France.

As well as being filled with colour, some of the photos are tinged with poignancy as many of the men pictured never came back.

On the right, Jack and Walter Satterthwaite pictured before Jack, on the left, was killed two years later. Walter was seriously wounded and died in 1962

They include Sergeant Jack Satterthwaite who is pictured stood alongside his younger brother Walter in front of a green hedge in the summer of 1914. He was shot and killed at Festubert, north west France, two years later.

Another image in the gallery that has been reproduced in colour was shot in 1920 - two years after the war - and depicts a town’s first armistice day commemorations at the newly-built war memorial.

The distinctive red, white and blue of the Union flag draped on top of the memorial provides a striking contrast to the solemn black and brown overcoats worn by those gathered.

Most of the men photographed served in the Hertfordshire Regiment at the start of the war.

The black and white photos have been given the 21st century colour makeover to mark the opening of an exhibition to be staged by the Herts at War project on August 4.

Dan Hill, who is leading the project, said: 'In applying new technology to historic images previously seen only in black and white we are able to cross the century long divide and bring individuals back to life, if only for that one moment in time.

'We are used to seeing photographs and film in the grainy images of 100 years ago and to see them enhanced in this way is a fantastic window into a war that seems ever more real as a result.

'We are proud to work with projects like colourising history in furthering the story of Herts at War as the centenary of the conflict approaches ever closer.'

The photographs have been reproduced by Doug Banks, of Colouring History.

He used Photoshop software to painstakingly colour in the pixels in the original photos.

He said: 'There is a bit of guess work in terms of getting the colours absolutely right and a bit of artistic licence is required.

'For instance, most of these photos were at the very start of the war so the uniforms would have been brand new and all been the same shade of khaki.

'One has to respect the content and whoever is in it and put aside what you think might look good in colour for the sake of it.

'I always start with the flesh and skin tones and try and relate to the people in the picture.

'Then I work on the clothing. People say that they were taken in black and white and they should remain that way but the people who lived through the war didn’t experience it in black and white.

'If there is just one person in the picture it would usually take me two or three hours but others have taken me half a day to do.'

One of the photos that have been reproduced shows a young boy wearing an army uniform in honour of the British soldier, much like how a child would wear a replica football shirt today.

Two other images show a Belgian refugee at work in a munitions factory in Letchworth Garden City in 1915 and wounded servicemen wearing their ‘hospital blues’ at a convalescent home in 1918.

The photos can be viewed at the Herts at War exhibition at Letchworth Garden City from August 4.

Doug
 Banks, the artist responsible for breathing new life into these First 
World War photographs, spends anywhere from a couple of hours to half a 
day turning the black and white images into colour.

Using
 Adobe Photoshop, he selects a picture, zooms in to a high resolution 
then 'paints' on new 'layers' of colour to specific areas of the images.
 This could be green for background trees, or a mixture of lighter 
colours to create pinkish skin tones.

Mr
 Banks said: 'It helps if the photograph is a high resolution. It is 
better if it's 300dpi or more because if it wasn't I wouldn't be able to
 expand it to colour it pixel by pixel.

'A lot of colourists in America use layers. I open it up and make it as big as I can without distorting it.

'I
 prefer to colour the skin tones first, I always work on the skin tones 
first because the person you're colouring then becomes a person.

'With
 this Photoshop software that I use it is referred to as building it up 
layer by layer. Skin tones are perhaps the first layer then build upon 
that.

'Then you may, depending on the age of the person, add other colours that make you a flesh as opposed to just pink.

'The
 eye is another layer, and talking about military photographs, I add the
 uniform. Generally if it's a British soldier it's usually khaki. So 
it's not just a case of I paint the khaki colour.

'Finally if that's all you've got, the background is another layer - picking out a background layer that complements.'

Mr
 Banks said there was some artistic license required in order to use 
colours which were suitable - such as duller colours for late war 
uniforms which were likely faded.

'It's
 painting by numbers without the numbers. But it isn't the case of just 
slapping on any old bit of colour. You do have to have some artistic 
bent, if you like.'
