Mathieu Flamini believes Arsenal have the ability to 'achieve something big' but have been 'unlucky' because of his side's injury problems.

The Gunners are currently languishing in sixth spot having won just seven of their 16 league games.

Arsenal currently have nine players sidelined through injury with the likes of club record signing Mesut Ozil, club captain Mikel Arteta and star defender Laurent Koscielny out injured.

And 30-year-old Arsenal midfielder Flamini insists the north London outfit would be higher up in the league if his team-mates had not been hampered by injury.

Flamini, speaking to Arsenal's official website, said: 'It's the belief of the team that we can really achieve something, and I think you [media] guys agree as well that we have top quality.

'We have a lot of quality - strong at the back, good in midfield and up front as well - so the only problem is we're very unlucky with injuries.

'I definitely believe we have the quality in the team to achieve something big. It's not easy to go through all these games with so many injuries, but I believe in my team and I believe in their quality.'
