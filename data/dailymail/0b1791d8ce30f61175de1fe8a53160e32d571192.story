Eden Hazard might be spearheading Chelsea's quest for three trophies this season, but manager Jose Mourinho is still demanding more from his star player.

Chelsea face Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday night with Hazard fresh from signing a new five-and-a-half-year deal at Stamford Bridge - and Mourinho now expects the playmaker to step up his goalscoring exploits to match the best players in the world.

The Special One's benchmarks for the Belgian are Cristiano Ronaldo (with 38 goals in 35 appearances this season) and Lionel Messi (37 in 36) - although Hazard's ratio of 13 goals in 39 games show he has some way to go yet.

Eden Hazard trains ahead of facing PSG - and Jose Mourinho wants him to start scoring more for Chelsea

Hazard has scored 13 goals in 39 appearances this season - some way off the world's best players

'Jose Mourinho would like for me to score more,' Hazard told French TV station Telefoot. 'Us forwards need to score and to pass. But I think I compensate for that given how many chances I create.

'I'm fouled a lot, there are a lot of free-kicks and penalties that I win. But he'd like me to score more, like those great players (Messi and Ronaldo) who score two or three times each game.'

Hazard is in his third season at Stamford Bridge following a £32million move from Lille in the summer of 2012 and he admits that for a player of his talent he should be scoring more. 

The Belgian playmaker feels the number of free-kicks and penalties he wins compensates for his lack of goals

Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are still some way clear of Hazard in the goalscoring stakes

'Apart from my last season in France I was always reproached for not being clinical enough, a good player but not clinical. Progressively I’ve taken that on board and I’ve often managed to be clinical in the big games.

'I’m continuing to improve. I’m only 24 and I’ve done some pretty good things in football already. So I hope it continues like this, that we’ll win trophies this year and again next year. We’ll be able to get better every season.'

Hazard is hoping for trophies this season with Chelsea top of the Premier League and still in two cups
