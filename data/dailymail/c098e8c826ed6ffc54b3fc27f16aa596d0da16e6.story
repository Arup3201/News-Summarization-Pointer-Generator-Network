Five people were stranded on a rocky island off Australia's central Queensland coast for nine hours before being winched to safety by a rescue helicopter.

The group of three men and two women, wrote an enormous 'SOS' message on a nearby sandbank after their boat's anchor broke, leaving them stranded on the island.

One of the five people rescued, Keswick Island resident Lyn Forbes-Smith, spoke to The Courier-Mail about the ordeal.Scroll down for video

SOS: Five people were found off the Queensland coast by helicopter after a SOS sand message was noticed on Monday afternoon

She explained that the group had come to terms with the idea that they would have to spend the night stranded on the island, but were confident that friends at home would raise the alarm once they did not return at a set time.

'We had reef walkers on thankfully, but we had no food, water, cream, no hats, not much at all,' Mrs Forbes Taylor said.

'We just looked for the highest ground, we looked for rocks where five of us could huddle together because we didn’t really want to separate, and we wanted to be out of the wind as best as possible.'

Queensland Water Police were alerted to a possible emergency when they noticed a six metre boat abandoned and floating between Brampton and Cockermouth islands on Monday afternoon.

Helicopters rescue crew noticed the SOS message after assisting water police in their search for occupants of an abandoned boat that had been found

After being unable to find the boat's passengers, they contacted the RACQ-CQ Rescue helicopter to help assist in the search at 2:15pm (AEST).

It was at this point, more than three hours later,  that the rescuers spotted the SOS message at nearby Wigton Island, where the boat's occupants had originally anchored their vessel in order to go ashore exploring before its anchor faltered, stranding them.

The five people were found soon after their message and were lifted off the island via the rescue helicopter and taken to the RACQ-CQ base at the inland Queensland city, Mackay.

The group had left Keswick Island at 8am for a snorkeling expedition before anchoring their boat on a sand bar near the rocky outcrop.

After setting out to explore the rocky island, the group noticed their boat drifting away in the rising tide but were unable to retrieve the vessel which was traveling fast on the tide.

With their mobile phones and sun protection left on the departing boat, the group could only head for high ground and wait.

'Just as we got over to the rocks one of the boat co-owners … turned back and could see that the boat had shifted,' Mrs Forbes-Smith said.

'We knew the sandbar would go under but we were fairly confident that the tide wouldn’t have taken over the rocks,' Mrs Forbes-Smith said.

Boats were not used in the rescue due to the island being inaccessible because of the shallow waters at the time of rescue.

Aside from some minor sunburn, the boats occupants were confirmed to be safe and in good health after their rescue despite the long ordeal.

It was only just over a week ago that a group of three fisherman also required rescuing via chopper off the Mackay coast on April 14.

The men, aged 20, 28 and 69 suffered minor injuries after their 15 meter trawler hit the Trogolby Reef, leaving them to spend five hours in the water waiting for help.

Rescue teams believed the fishing boat lost control due to the high winds caused by Cyclone Ita.
