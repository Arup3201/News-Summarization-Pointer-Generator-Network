Jailed: Karl Clay, 39, from Wood End, Coventry, has been jailed for life for committing sexual offences against 10 victims

A serial paedophile who poured petrol over his young victims and threatened to set them on fire during a 20 year campaign of abuse was today jailed for life.

Karl Clay, 39, sexually assaulted 10 different victims - the youngest being just six-years-old - in a string of horrific attacks.

A court heard 20-stone Clay systematically targeted both adults and children during a two decade reign of terror - using various threats to make them comply with his demands.

It was only after two of his youngest victims - now in their teens - broke their silence in 2011 that police launched a major probe and uncovered a catalogue of crimes dating back into the early 1990s.

Warwick Crown Court heard Clay threatened his victims with weapons while subjecting them to prolonged and degrading sexual acts.

In 2005 the 'bullying monster' poured petrol over three of his victims, including two children, and threatened to set them alight while repeatedly flicking a lighter next to them.

Clay was convicted of two counts of rape, two counts of actual bodily harm, attempted rape, indecency with a child, indecent assault, putting a person in fear of violence, threats to kill, two counts of rape of a child under 13, causing a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity and putting a person in fear of violence by harassment in July.

Clay, from Wood End, Coventry, was told he must serve at least 15 years behind bars after he was found guilty of the 'terrible catalogue' of offences.

Sentencing, Judge Sylvia De Bertobano said many of Clay’s vulnerable victims had been left scarred for life by his actions.

Jailing Clay for life, she said: 'It was a terrible catalogue of offending against women and children.

'It’s a tale of terrible abuse targeted at those who are vulnerable. There’s nothing that you or I can do to give these victims back their lost childhood.

'By pleading not guilty you put them through the further ordeal of giving evidence.

'I have no doubt whatsoever that you are
a significant risk to the public and it’s abundantly clear that you 
will continue to be a danger.

'This sentence reflects the public horror of these offences.'

Guilty: Clay even threatened to set three of his victim on fire after dousing them with petrol

The court was told Clay’s victims were often abused more than once as he used 'manipulation and fear' to get away with repeated attacks.

These varied from threats, to punches and kicks, right through to the most serious sexual assaults, jurors were told.

One woman told police Clay had rammed a pillow on her face to suffocate her while another recalled how he attempted to drown her in a bath full of water.

He also forced his child victims to watch hardcore pornography - and in another incident he stabbed a boy’s foot with a fork.

Speaking after the case, DCI Chris Hanson, of West Midlands Police, said he believed Clay may have preyed on other victims and urged them to come forward.

He said: 'Karl Clay is easily the vilest offender I have ever dealt with in the 21 years that I have been a police officer and his victims have been terribly brave in giving the evidence that was crucial in convicting him.

'While our enquiry uncovered 10 of Clay’s victims, I would be surprised if there aren’t others out there.

'We know that Clay is a violent predator who exerted power and control over his victims.

'But he’s now safely behind bars and I would urge anyone else who has suffered because of him to contact the police.'

There are some crimes which justify re-instating the death penalty - this is one of them!  Disgusting piece of FILTH does not deserve to be breathing our air.

Why is it that life never means life? Just stupid sentencing someone to life, when in reality, it means 10 or 15 years. This creature should never be let back into society. Pedophiles never change.

Don't say that he has been sentenced to life in prison when we all know he could be out in 15-20 years! Life should mean life!

He poured petrol on children then abused them and he only gets 15 years...life should mean just that in this case!

So if he is a danger to the public, then he will still be a danger in 15 years. What a pig.

The justice system in Britain is the laughing stock of the world. Soon it will be, life in jail, out in a year, joke.
