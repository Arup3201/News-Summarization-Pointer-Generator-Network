The smallest of the big cats, leopards are known for their speed and agility.

This one, however, has another talent... finding the most comfortable tree for a relaxing snooze at the Bali Safari Park in Indonesia.

Sleeping straight through the afternoon without stirring an inch, he appears content as he lounges about in the sun.

Cat nap: The Javan leopard dozed through the midday heat at Bali Safari Park in Indonesia

The Javan leopard was captured by structural engineer Hannu Soini, 35, of Halsua, Finland, after he managed to take a picture of the sleeping beauty during a trip to the safari park.

Mr Soini said: 'When I saw the leopard it instantly reminded me of a napping domestic cat.

'He probably had a heavy lunch and so had decided to nap on top of this log.

'I spotted the leopard in the afternoon; it felt like I was in the right place at the right time.

'I was lucky to get this shot.'

Known for being stealthy hunters, unequalled tree climbers, fast runners and strong swimmers, this napping leopard obviously decided today was a day for sleep.

Javan leopards are adaptable to many environments but are now critically endangered due to loss of habitat, prey reduction and poaching.

As Hannu and others visitors stood watching and taking pictures, the lethargic leopard refused to wake from its slumber.

'The leopard just kept sleeping even when I went on to photograph the colourful birds,' Hannu continues.

'I get a really positive response from artist and photographers.'

Bali Safari Park is located on 40 hectares of pristine forest in Gianyar and is known for both its creative animal exhibits and its tireless conservation work.
