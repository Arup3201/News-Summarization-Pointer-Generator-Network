Most trips on the M25 involve lorries, traffic jams and a case of high blood pressure. 

But motorists were left stunned when they spotted something a little different - a giraffe travelling along the middle lane of the motorway.

The head of the animal could be seen poking above the tailgate of a trailer yesterday afternoon.

The giraffe was spotted on the M25 in Kent, being driven in a foreign-registered vehicle

The giraffe, called Valentino, was spotted on the M25 being transferred from Paignton zoo in Devon to a new home in Port Lympne Wild Animal Park in Kent

Teacher Mark Marsh, 44, took a picture of the giraffe as it was being transferred from Paignton zoo in Devon to a new home in Port Lympne Wild Animal Park in Kent. 

Mr Marsh said the unusual sight of the giraffe, near Redhill in Surrey had 'brightened up' his journey.

The foreign-registered vehicle was spotted carrying one of Africa's more exotic exports on the M25 in Kent.

Paignton Zoo said it was a Rothschild's giraffe called Valentino, who had been born on Valentine's Day in 2012.

The giraffe had to be hand reared by keepers following rejection by his mother.

Port Lympne said his arrival signals the start of the reserve's breeding programme with these endangered animals.

Animal director Adrian Harland said: 'We are delighted to welcome this lovely male giraffe to the reserve and to be accepted as part of this breeding programme.

'There are so few Rothschild giraffes in the wild that programmes like this one are essential.'

Port Lympne has become part of a worldwide breeding programme designed to save the endangered species. It is estimated that fewer than 700 individuals remain in the wild.

Paul Beer, head of the giraffe section, said: 'The arrival of Valentino is fantastic news. He's a good looking, healthy male and I'm hoping that the girls take a shine to him.'

Visitors to the reserve will be able to see Valentino exploring his new surroundings on The African Experience - 100 acres of land, alive with African animals including black rhino, zebra, wildebeest and ostrich.

A giraffe died last month while it was being transported along a busy highway in South Africa

Last month, a giraffe died after smashing its head into a low bridge while it was being transported along a busy highway in South Africa.

The moments before the accident  were caught on camera by horrified fellow driver, Thinus Botha, who described hearing a loud crack.

Mr Botha, 32, took the photo of the two giraffes after driving next to the truck for half a mile on the N1 on the outskirts of Pretoria, South Africa's capital.

He decided to pull over to capture the moment - and witnessed the gruesome accident seconds later. 

Some Twitter users pointed out the similarities with the film The Hangover Part III, which features lead character Alan Garner causing a 20-car pileup after accidentally decapitating a giraffe he bought.
