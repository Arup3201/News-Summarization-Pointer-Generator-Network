A father and his friend have been charged after allegedly dragging his four-year-old son across a street on a leash and tying him to a tree so that they could smoke drugs.

The child was dragged across a highway, up over a curb and along 20 feet of landscaped bark, before being tethered to a tree, horrified witnesses told police on 911 calls.

The boy's father, Richard Marsh, 29, and 35-year-old Paul Rapp, were arrested in Salt Lake City, Utah on Sunday on child abuse and drug possession charges.Â

Detective Greg Wilking told the Daily News: 'The child tripped and went down in the road. The friend of the father just continued.'

Police arrested Marsh and Rapp at the scene after finding marijuana and a pipe nearby.

The boy suffered minor injuries including road rash after being trailed along by his backpack harness, and is now in the care of his mother.

Attempts to contact Marsh by local station KUTV led them to a run-down home where a party was going on.

Marsh's brother Johny Phillips defended him, saying that he was good father but admitted that his brother does chain up his son.

Mr Philips, who was dressed in lingerie, said: 'I know why he chained him to the tree. It's something he does when we go fishing and stuff because the kid has a tendency of going all over the place. Last time, I had to save him from going into the river.'

He added: 'He's a damn good dad, he cares about his kid.'

Marsh remains in the Salt Lake County Jail while Rapp was released on bond.

Johnny Phillips, who was partying in lingerie at a last known address for Richard Marsh, said on Wednesday that his brother 'was a great father'
