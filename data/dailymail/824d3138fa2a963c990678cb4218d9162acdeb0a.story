She pulled off some jaw-dropping stunts during her days as a Charlie's Angel, so hanging off the side of a New York skyscraper fire-escape in a strapless ballgown would be an easy feat for Lucy Liu.

The actress is embracing her inner Spider-Man to star in a new campaign for  Mandarin Oriental.

Liu has been named as the latest celebrity fan of the hotel group, joining Liam Neeson, Dame Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey and others.

The 45-year-old star chose the Mandarin Oriental New York as her favourite of the brand's luxury properties.

It is a fitting choice for the born-and-bred New Yorker, who was raised in a Mandarin-speaking household.

She praises the hotel's excellent location, close to Central Park, and its 'delicious and comforting' Chinese breakfast.

Lucy was photographed by portrait photographer Mary McCartney (daughter of Sir Paul), who has shot each of the celebrities for the 'He's a fan/She's a fan' campaign.  

'The award-winning campaign continues to make a strong statement about the Group in a simple and luxurious manner, and we are delighted to welcome Lucy Liu as our newest ambassador,' said Jill Kluge, Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group's Director of Brand Communications. 

'By focusing on celebrities who clearly appreciate the finer things in life, we have been able to show the quality of our hotels in a far more interesting way than traditional hotel advertising,' she added.
