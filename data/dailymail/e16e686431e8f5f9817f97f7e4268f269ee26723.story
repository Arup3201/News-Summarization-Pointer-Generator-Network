As the work of a renowned French photographer, this nude photograph is celebrated as a work of art.

It currently features in an exhibition at the Jeu de Paume museum in Paris, attracting art lovers from across the most romantic city of all.

Despite this, however, it appears that Facebook is far less impressed.

Ban: This nude photograph currently features in an exhibition at the Jeu de Paume museum in Paris. However, when it appeared on the musuem's Facebook page, the social networking site decided to remove the image

The museum's Facebook account was blocked for 24 hours on Friday after the social networking site decided to remove the photograph from the museum's page.

In a message which the museum received, Facebook said the photograph was a violation of its guidelines.

The message, as reported by Worldcrunch, said: 'We have removed the following content you posted or were the admin of because it violates Facebook's Statement of Rights and Responsibilities.'

The picture was taken by Laure Albin Guillot (1879-1962) and was included in the exhibition of the photographer at the contemporary art museum, which is located in central Paris.

Rules: Facebook said the photograph was a violation of its guidelines

Following the 24-hour ban, the museum wrote to its fans and said: 'We had already committed other offenses in the past, publishing nudes by Willy Ronis and Manuel Alvarez Bravo.

'We will not publish nudes in the future, even though we believe that they have a high artistic value, and that there is nothing pornographic about these photographs, which are in accordance with "the right to publish contents of a personal nature.'

The museum added that if it receives another warning its account may be permanently deactivated.

The controversy follows the decision by Facebook last year to remove an image of Gerhard Richter's 'Ema' from the page of the Paris Pompidou Center.

However, it did later apologise for confusing the painting with a photograph. The social networking site forbids nude photographs, however, it does not ban nude paintings or sculptures.
