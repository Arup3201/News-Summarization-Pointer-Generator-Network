A Kansas man who left his 10-month-old foster daughter to die in a hot car while he and his partner smoked weed and watched 'Game of Thrones,' has been sentenced to 32 months in prison

'I'm not a monster,' said Seth Jackson, 29, in court on Friday as he begged the judge not to give him jail time for the death of kadillak Poe-Jones.

'Your honor, I'm a broken man, pleading here for my life,' Jackson told the judge on Friday.

Jackson wiped away his tears as he was sentenced. His lawyers have 14 days to appeal the sentencing. 

On a sweltering 90-degree day in July Seth Jackson and his partner Payton Schroeder watched over two hours of Game of Thrones as their five other children played inside.

Sentencing: Seth Jackson, 29,  pictured in court today, begged for a judge not to put him behind bars  and told the judge he was 'not a monster'

Dead: Kadillak Poe Jones was left in a hot car for over two hours and left to die as her foster parents got high and watched Game of Thrones

Tortured: Seth Jackson's mother says her son 'wants to die' and that he dedicated his entire life to children 

Jackson's mother also spoke up for her son telling NBC reporters, 'he is devastated. He wants to die.' 

She said her son lived for his children and for the high school students he taught.

She said he never would have wanted any child to feel harm and that he wishes it were him inside of the car instead of the young girl.

It wasn't until Jackson heard a baby's cries on television that he remembered Poe-Jones was still sitting inside the hot car with the windows rolled up. 

The judge said that while Jackson did not mean to leave his foster daughter in a car, it was not an accident. 

Heartbroken: Seth Jackson, who has five other children with his partner, says he no longer has anything to live for and wishes it were he who died inside of the hot car instead of his foster daughter 

Police say the girl was inside the car with the windows up for more than two hours. It was around 90 degrees outside. An autopsy showed she died of hyperthermia due to heat exposure.

The affidavit says Schroeder told police that Jackson called that day to let him know he would be picking Kadillak up from the baby sitter after taking their 5-year-old adopted child to a doctor's appointment.

Jackson told police that when he arrived home, he locked the car and went inside with his 5-year-old and pizza he had picked up.

Schroeder revealed to investigators that he and Jackson smoked marijuana that Jackson had earlier picked up that day, according to the affidavit.

Both men said they ran to the car to retrieve Kadillak and call authorities.

Schroeder told investigators Kadillak was hot and stiff when she was taken from the car and carried into the house. As he called 911, Jackson attempted CPR but could not get the child's mouth open, according to the affidavit filed by Wichita police detective Ryan Schomaker.

Family: In addition to Kadillak, whom they were trying to adopt, Jackson and his partner had five other children in their care. They had three other foster children ages 3, 5 and 18, and two adopted children ages 5 and 7

Officers who responded found Jackson still on the phone when they arrived, making calls and repeatedly stating, 'I left her in the car, she's dead, she's dead,' according to the affidavit.

Meanwhile, Kadillak was unresponsive and lying on her back on the couch.

Firefighters moved her from the couch to the floor once they arrived and attempted to revive her.

Later in an interview at police headquarters, Schroeder told detectives he and Jackson had been foster parents to Kadillak since she was 2 weeks old.

Although the girl died of hyperthermia, Sedgwick County District Attorney Marc Bennett said the first-degree murder charge was warranted because the child died during the commission of an inherently dangerous felony, aggravated endangering of a child. The case is not charged as intentional murder.

In addition to Kadillak, whom they were trying to adopt, Jackson and Schroeder had five other children in their care.

They had three other foster children ages 3, 5 and 18, and two adopted children ages 5 and 7.

The two younger foster children were visiting other relatives at the time the 10-month-old died.

The Kansas Department of Children and Families (DCF) said in a July 30 statement 'We remain deeply saddened that this child suffered such a horrific death.

We support the charges filed in this case, and we will aid in any way possible the prosecution of the defendant.'

The children were taken by the state.
