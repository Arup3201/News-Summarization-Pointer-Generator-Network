A 4.2-metre crocodile has been put down after it pounced at two visitors walking along a highway in Kakadu National Park.

The monster creature attacked the walkers - who were near a waterway - on Arnhem Highway, about 30 kilometres from Jabiru, in the Northern Territory about 10am on Tuesday.

Following the incident, it was killed and then rangers fished it out of the water with a tractor.

A Parks Australia spokeswoman said in a statement to Daily Mail Australia the two people were making their way through long grass near a culvert when the crocodile 'lunged' at them.

Fortunately, they were able to get away uninjured and went to report the incident to rangers.

The spokeswoman said the pair were 'a bit shaken up'. 

'Our rangers headed straight out to the scene, and they could clearly see large croc tracks in the grass, heading into the water, but no sign of the croc,' the spokeswoman said.

The rangers then returned to the site under the cover of night to try and spot the animal when its eyes reflected the search lights.

'They quickly located a crocodile fitting the description, a 4.2-metre croc that was missing a portion of its tail and appeared underweight,' the spokeswoman said.

'The animal was shot and removed in the interest of public safety.

'We never take this decision lightly, but public safety is paramount.' 

NT Parks and Wildlife Commission's Tommy Nichols told the ABC waterways in Kakadu ran into major river systems and people had to be on alert in case a crocodile appeared.

The senior ranger for crocodile management estimated the crocodile to be at least 16 years old because it was four metres in size.

This comes after a horror year in crocodile attacks in the Top End.

Last year, the Northern Territory had its highest number of crocodile-related deaths on record.

The pair were 60 kilometres from Jabiru while on the Arnhem Highway in the Northern Territory

Saltwater crocodiles killed four Territorians last year, which is almost one-fifth of the total 21 people killed since 1974.

In January 2014, a 12-year-old boy was snatched by a croc while swimming with friends at a billabong in Kakadu on Australia Day.

Six months later, while washing out a bucket off the back of his boat, a 62-year-old man was killed on the South Alligator River in Kakadu

In August of the same year on the Tiwi Islands, a 22-year-old man's remains were found by police in the stomach of a crocodile that was shot a short time later.

Then Tran Van Lanh, 57, waded into the Adelaide River to unsnag a fishing line and was fatally attacked by a rare, well-known albino-headed crocodile called Michael Jackson as his wife witnessed in horror.
