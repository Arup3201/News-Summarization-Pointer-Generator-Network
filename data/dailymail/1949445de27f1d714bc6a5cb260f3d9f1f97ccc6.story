This is the shocking moment a gang of 11 clubbers in Manchester started a mini-riot in the street outside a club by throwing bricks, bottles and metal barriers at each other.

The men have now all been jailed after admitting violent disorder following the 25-minute brawl in February last year.

CCTV cameras captured the scene outside the NQ Live club after secruity guards threw 'rude' Chase Halford out of the venue around 4am.

Eleven yobs who started a street brawl outside a club in Manchester last year have been jailed

The fight, which involved bricks, bottles and metal barriers being thrown, started after a group were thrown out of the NQ Live venue

The 25-minute fracas happened around 4am last February after Chase Halford was thrown out of the club

He was followed by Saqib Ali, 20, who Manchester Crown Court heard was the 'main problem', and then by Martin Kavanagh, Vandelle McLaren and Aaron Costello.

Hotheaded Ali had to be hauled out of the club, before leading an attack in which bouncers were punched and kicked.

Ali's group who were escorted from the building following a complaint from fellow reveller Daniel Gleave.

Inside the club, Gleave 'formed an alliance' with Sonny Elms and William Russell, as they watched the fracas unfold outside on the club's CCTV system.

The trio were warned to hang back by bouncers - but instead joined the fray, stepping up the violence.

At first the group push and jostle each other outside the venue, but then punches are thrown before several metal barriers are hurled through the air.

As the brawl turns ugly the clubbers move backwards into a road, hitting several cars as they exchange blows with whichever objects come to hand.

Chase was quickly joined by four other friends including Ali Shaqib, described as the 'main problem' by bouncers

Despite being warned by bouncers to stay inside, Gleave 'formed an alliance' with two clubbers before joining in

Chase Halford, 20, said to have played a 'significant part' in the chaos while also in breach of a suspended sentence, has been given 16 months in a young offenders institution.

Saqib Ali, 20, was given 25 weeks behind bars for his 'bizarre and undisciplined' behaviour.

Daniel Gleave, 26, and Sonny Elms, 21, who were also at the centre of the melee, have been jailed for 23 weeks and 70 weeks respectively. Basharat Afzal, 21, got 43 weeks behind bars.

Vandelle McLaren, 23, and Khan Nisar, 22, were given an intensive alternative to custody order and a 12-month community order respectively, plus £750 costs and unpaid work requirements.

Aaron Costello, 21,  got an intensive alternative to custody order with various requirements.

As objects start being thrown the brawl spreads into a nearby road and cars are hit with metal barriers

Sentencing the men at Manchester Crown Court Mr Recorder Atherton warned other clubbers that violent offences which drain public finances will not be tolerated

William Russell, 27, of Halliwell Road, Bolton, who suffered a cut which needed 19 stitches, was given a 12-month sentence, suspended for two years, with supervision.

Wajarat Afzal, 19, of Kearsley Road, Crumpsall, got six months in a young offenders institution, suspended for two years, with unpaid work, plus £750 costs.

Martin Kavanagh, 20, of Carstairs Close, Cheetham, who tried to keep others from fighting before joining in, has been sentenced to 150 unpaid work, with a curfew and £750 costs.

Mr Recorder Atherton, sentencing, said: 'The message must go out from here and be heard that offences like this, which are so draining on public resources, will not be tolerated.

'People must realise, by indulging in violence like this, they will lose their liberty, with all the consequences of loss of employment, family life, and employment prospects.'
