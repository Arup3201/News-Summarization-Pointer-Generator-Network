The Academy Awards red carpet is all but synonymous with major celebrity fashion moments.

From Gwyneth Paltrow's pink Ralph Lauren frock, which she wore for the 71st Annual ceremony, to Hilary Swank's backless Guy LaRoche from the 2005 Awards, when she picked up top prize for Million Dollar Baby, there has been no shortage of iconic Oscars dresses to covet over the past several decades. 

Whether you prefer Best Actress winner Julianne Moore’s statement making, bedazzled Chanel gown or this season’s must-have red-hot hue, worn by Gone Girl’s Rosamund Pike, there was something for everyone at this year’s Academy Awards. 

Here's how to get your favorite Oscar looks for less...

EMMA STONE in ELIE SAAB 

All that glitters is…chartreuse. Best Supporting Actress nominee Emma Stone chose a rather unconventional hue for her dazzling, intricately detailed dress on last night’s red carpet. 

She paired her long-sleeved Elie Saab gown with matching open-toed pumps and understated earrings for an all-around effortlessly elegant look. 

Think only the A list can dress in designer gear? Think again. Copy Emma's look with this Escada Chartreuse silk cowl neck belted gown ($113), Jimmy Choo metallic Chartreuse strappy sandels ($100) and stirling silver square stud earrings ($6.89)

Take a gamble like Emma in this unusual coloured floor length Escada gown for only $113 

JULIANNE MOORE in CHANEL

Julianne Moore’s custom-made strapless Chanel gown is a look fit for a Best Actress winner. 

The statuesque, body-skimming style boasted intricate beading, sparkly details and dazzling belt-like accents, so it’s no surprise then that the stunning dress itself took 927 hours to complete.

Go elegant like Julianne in a Sue Wong white beaded fitted evening gown ($245), spiral kaleidoscope 18KT diamond earrings ($7,500) and Jimmy Choo India sling back glitter strappy heels ($349)

Bring out the detail in an embellished gown with some sparkle in these spiral kaleidoscope 18KT diamond earrings for a bargain $7,500

ROSAMUND PIKE in GIVENCHY

Red had a major moment on the 87th Annual Academy Awards red carpet. The best of the bunch? 

Gone Girl star Rosamund Pike in a strapless, lace applique Givenchy with a dramatic up-to-there slit. 

The Oscar nominee ensured that her dress took center stage by pairing it with simple red sandals and stylish diamond drop earrings. 

Copy Roamund's colour style with this red strapless lace tulle Chalaza evening gown ($82.99), Michael Kors Tatianna suede strappy heels ($79.99) and diamond dangle drop earring in 14K white gold ($2,499)

Add some serious glamour to your outfit like Rosamund with this pair of Michael Kors Tatianna suede strappy heels for just $79.99
