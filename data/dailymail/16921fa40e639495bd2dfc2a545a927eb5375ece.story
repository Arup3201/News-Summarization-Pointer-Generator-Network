Ciro Immobile says all went according to plan in Italy's 2-0 win over 10-man Holland as the striker's first international goal got life under new manager Antonio Conte off to an ideal start.

The 24-year-old took less than three minutes to put Italy in front against the World Cup semi finalists, and the Borussia Dortmund forward reckons it couldn't have gone any better.

'I am happy with my first official goal for Italy. The game went the way we had prepared for it and we did what the coach asked,' Immobile told Rai Sport.

'The team was concentrated for the whole 90 minutes and fortunately it went well.'

Immobile worked with Conte in the 2010-11 season at Siena, and says reigniting that partnership has helped so far. 

'I know the coach well back from our time at Siena,' he continued. 

'He's the same old "hammer" and that's only right that he forces the players to give their best. We are symbols for Italy, after all.

'Fortunately I had already worked with Conte at Siena and last season at Torino we played the same movements with (Alessio) Cerci under Giampiero Ventura.

'I tried to help (Simone) Zaza, who had never worked with Conte before, to get the right movements.'

Italy had a Daniele De Rossi penalty to thank for the second goal after just 10 minutes as Bruno Martins Indi saw red for a foul on Simeone Zaza.

Italy travel to Norway for their Euro 2016 qualification opener on Tuesday.
