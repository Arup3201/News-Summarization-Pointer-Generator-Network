As Andros Townsend walks into Tottenham’s plush training ground reception on Monday afternoon, he is surrounded by scouts.

There’s an Under 21 match against Leicester about to kick off; spies from across the country have made their way to Spurs’ Enfield HQ with a view to picking up a little gem ahead of next week’s transfer deadline.

There was a time, not too long ago, when Townsend would have been the subject of such attention.

Andros Townsend is gearing up for Wednesday night's Capital One Cup clash against Sheffield United

Townsend has come a long way from the player who appeared to be on his way out at Spurs 

The winger scored the only goal of the first leg against Nigel Clough's League One Blades 

Having spent no less than nine loan periods away from White Hart Lane, there was a time when this talented winger wondered if he would ever make the grade at the club he supported as a boy.

Now he is on the brink of a Wembley cup final as Tottenham take a slender 1-0 advantage to Sheffield United tonight in their Capital One Cup semi-final second-leg clash.

He’s certainly come a long way.

Heralded as England’s next superstar in October 2013 after scoring on his international debut against Montenegro, Townsend is now desperate to make his first Wembley appearance as a club footballer.

And as we sit, after Monday’s training session, looking ahead to Wednesday's encounter the topic of his progress since that dazzling international debut is broached.

How does Townsend feel about his development since the euphoria of a man-of-the-match display on his England bow?

His response: ‘I’ve spoken a lot about this before, and I don’t really want to go through it again.

‘I’ll go through it briefly. I got injuries at the worst times - I got injured three or four games after making my England debut.

‘Hopefully now I’m on the road back. I’m back in the Spurs side, playing reasonably well and back to where I want to be.’

It was a somewhat frosty reply. But to be fair, he has a point.

An ankle injury cruelly denied him the chance of going to the World Cup in the summer, while this season has been disrupted by thigh and further ankle problems.

Likewise, he was a peripheral figure during the opening weeks of Mauricio Pochettino’s reign; in and out of the Argentine’s plans.

Slowly but surely, though, he has proved his worth to his manager and is back in the side - a shock start against Manchester United last month proving the catalyst in a resurgence.

‘The biggest confidence booster for me was against United, when the manager threw me in,’ revealed Townsend.

‘We have a meeting in the morning of games where the manager says the team; it was unexpected so I couldn’t wait to get going.

‘I hadn’t started in the Premier League for a month or so and we did well that game. After that we beat Chelsea so that gave me a big confidence boost.’

But what does he have to do to ensure he stays a fixture in Pochettino’s starting XI?

Despite his rapid progress over the past 18 months, doubts over Townsend’s end product continue to linger.

‘Of course there are areas of my game I still need to work on,’ admitted the winger.

‘It’s no secret I have to improve my assist and goal ratio - that’s what I’m solely focusing on.

‘I don’t listen to critics but you know in yourself what you need to improve. I analyse every match I play so I know my good points and bad points.

‘I don’t take notice of stats, in a game you could put five great crosses in but no one gets on the end of it and you don’t get an assist.’

An area of his game that doesn’t need improvement, however, is his accuracy from the spot.

Townsend's progress at international level was curtailed by injury somewhat

All five of his goals this season have come from 12 yards and he looks to have taken over from Roberto Soldado as the club’s first-choice penalty taker.

‘You have to zone out,’ said Townsend.

‘Pick your side, don’t change your mind, focus on what side you want to put it, don’t look at the keeper - just solely on the ball.’

His penalty in the first leg at White Hart Lane could yet prove the pivotal moment in his side’s semi-final against the Blades.

But Townsend is refusing to allow himself to dream of Wembley ahead of Wednesday's Capital One Cup showdown.

‘We can’t think about Wembley. It’s great to be in the semi-final, but being a semi-final loser is the worse place to be.

‘I’ve never played there as club player. I was part of the 19-man squad for the FA Cup semi-final against Portsmouth in 2010, but they wanted me there for the experience.

‘I went there as a fan in the 2008 League Cup final we won and the one we lost the year after.

‘I’d go with my dad, brother and sister, it was a great occasion for the family.

‘So to have the chance to go as a player is a dream come true.’
