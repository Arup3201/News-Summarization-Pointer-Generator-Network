Most people feel pretty risqué having one or two tattoos, but one man has taken body art to an entirely new level.

Vin Los, 24 from Montreal has covered his face, neck and torso with dozens of tattooed words.

Far from the elaborate artistic designs most tattoo fans covet, Vin has basic words, inked in different sizes, spread haphazardly across his face and body.

Vin Los has 24 tattoos on his face alone, including phrases like 'scream my name' and and 'iconic face'

Vin says he chose words because drawings don't mean anything to him and he wants to make an 'impact'

Looking slightly like someone has gone to town on his (admittedly perfect) body with a marker pen, Vin has even filmed himself rubbing his body down with a wet cloth to prove his inkings are real.

As well as his own name in huge letters on his stomach, Vin’s arms and face are covered with words such as ‘sex bomb’, ‘iconic’, ‘Tokyo’, ‘fame’ and ‘guilty’. Vin has also had hairs tattooed onto his chest.

Speaking to Vice, Vin explains: ‘Drawings don’t mean anything to me. It may sound like I have bad values or something, but my tattoos aren’t just for me.

Vin says his ambition is to be the 'most famous man in the world'

Vin got his first tattoo - the Le Coq Sportif logo on his chest - aged just 16

'I want to be an image for people to look at, something that has an impact. Everybody who sees me is bound to ask questions: “Why fame? What’s his life like?”’

Vin caught the body art bug early, getting his first tattoo - the Le Coq Sportif logo - at aged 16. He now has 24 words tattooed on his face.

Despite the fact the words will be with him forever, he is surprisingly relaxed about choosing them.

‘It’s very superficial. I’ll go on YouTube and listen to all the big hits and I’ll just take words from these songs. For example, “Top of the World” is from the song by The Cataracs, but it’s also what I want.

‘A lot of people ask me if I’m scared I might regret it one day. If I was indecisive, I don’t think I would write on my face.’

Unsurprisingly his highly unusual appearance combined with his good looks are gaining him increasing attention online, which is a good thing for the man who says he wants to be ‘the most famous man in the world.’
