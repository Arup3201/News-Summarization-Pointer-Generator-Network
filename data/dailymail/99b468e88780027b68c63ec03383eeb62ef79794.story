Raided: Model and actress Belen Rodriguez posted online: 'I got all the presents, in two days we leave!'

A showgirl's Christmas was ruined when her Milan home was burgled after she posted details of her travel plans on Facebook.

Model and actress Belen Rodriguez had reportedly taken boyfriend Stefano De Martino home to meet her family in South America when her apartment was targeted by thieves.

Just days before the break-in, the Argentinian TV star had written on Facebook: 'Ok! I got all the presents, in two days we leave! It's been five years since I've had Christmas with my family, I'm really happy!'

On December 20, the 28-year-old added: 'Ok... last working day before departure. I'll keep you updated! Kisses!'

The thieves broke into the elegant apartment building she shares with her dancer boyfriend through a window on the night of December 23.

A porter noticed the open window the next morning and called the police after trying unsuccessfully to contact Ms Rodriguez.

The television personality has dated a series of high-profile men including Italian footballer Marco Borriello and Sicilian TV star Fabrizio Corona.

Last year, a sex tape apparently featuring Belen and then-boyfriend Tobias Blanco was posted online.

The burglary is not the only crime committed by opportunistic thieves in Italy over Christmas.

Steel baron Giorgio Falck's widow Silvia's Milan home was also raided, with intruders taking jewellery, gold and certificates of deposit worth 200,000 euros.

'There are worse things,' said Mrs Falck afterwards, according to Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera.

'I am sorry to have lost a few memories, but my children are well, and in the safe there certainly was not the treasure of the shah of Persia.'

Gangs also hit stores, supermarkets and banks in Rome, taking two Nike shop assistants hostage just hours before closing.

The
 employees were held at gunpoint and asked to open a safe containing 
50,000 euros, then tied up and left behind as the thieves fled.
