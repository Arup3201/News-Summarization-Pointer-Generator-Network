Court Case: Sylvia Nasar, pictured, is suing her employers Columbia University saying she is owed almost $1million in outstanding grant money

The Columbia University professor who wrote 'A Beautiful 
Mind' has filed a suit against the school over almost $1million.

According to a summons filed in Manhattan's Supreme Court, Sylvia 
Nasar says Columbia owes her $923,000 dating back to September 1998 from an 
endowment grant. The summons was 
filed on Jan. 7.

'The nature of this action and the relief sought is to recover 
damages for breach of contractual duties owed to plaintiff as a 
third-party beneficiary, unjust enrichment and conversion, arising out 
of the diversion of funds accruing for the benefit of plaintiff pursuant
to an endowment grant by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation 
dated Sept. 17, 1998," reads the summons published by capitolnewyork.com.

Her attorney, Mark Lawless, said he was "not in a position to comment at this point" to the website.

Columbia also declined to comment.

Naser penned the Pulitzer nominated A Beautiful Mind, which tells the life story of Nobel Prize winner John Nash and his struggle living with Schizophrenia, in 1998.

Nash eventually grew able to ignore his hallucinations and to continue his groundbreaking work.

The author first wrote about Nash in a series of articles for the New York Times. 

It was later turned into a film by Ron Howard starring Russell Crowe and won four Academy Awards.

Nasar was relaxed about her work's translation to the big-screen.

'A movie with Russell Crowe can reach far more than a book 
will,' she told Columbia News in 2002.

'The story wakes you up to the fact that many types 
of people suffer from this illness, and it highlights the fact that 
people can recover'

'There had not been a paragraph written on Nash, and no one 
who knew him wanted to put schizophrenia on the record because he had 
already suffered so much.'

Nasar is the John S. and James L. Knight Professor of Business Journalism at 
Columbia. She has written for numerous publications including The New Yorker magazine.
