It's one of the rarest cars in the world - and here it is with a completely unique paint job.

A multi-millionaire motorist caused a stir in London by showing off this incredible black and gold Saudi-registered Bugatti Veyron.

The £1million supercar was spotted outside London's exclusive Dorchester Hotel after being flown over this week.

It is one of the rarer convertible Veyrons, known as the Grand Sport, with just 150 built by the French manufacturer.

The Saudi-registered car, which wears
 the '1' plate, started off as a white Veyron but was recently sent to 
Dubai for a makeover.

Customising firm Foilacar then 
wrapped the Veyron in gold and black - transforming it into one of the 
world's most eye-catching supercars.

It it has become the star attraction 
outside The Dorchester since arriving this week with enthusiasts 
clamouring to get a photo of the 252mph supercar.

The gold and black Veyron was parked 
next to a pearlescent Mercedes SLS Gullwing and a number of 
foreign-registered Rolls-Royces outside the Mayfair hotel.

It is the latest Arab car to arrive 
in London as part of 'The Season', when the super-wealthy swap the 
desert for Britain's temperate climate.

The Veyron Grand Sport was unveiled 
by the ultra-posh Molsheim firm in 2008 as a convertible alternative to 
the then world's fastest car.

It is powered by an 8-litre engine 
which develops around 1,000bhp - giving the Grand Sport a 0-62mph time 
of 2.7 seconds and a staggering top speed of 252mph.

Millionaire's motor: The £1million supercar was spotted outside London's exclusive Dorchester Hotel after being flown over this week

An uninsured driver was left red-faced today after police sold his £218,000 Lamborghini - and kept the cash for themselves.

Officers from the Met Police pulled over the motorist when they spotted him driving the orange Lamborghini Aventador without a front plate.

After carrying out a number of checks they found the driver, who was not the registered owner, did not have insurance.

Second supercar: This Lamborghini Aventador, which was seized by police, sold for £218,000 at auction in Colchester, Essex, today

They seized the 217mph supercar, which cost around £350,000 new, as part of the Operation Cubo, the Met’s crackdown on uninsured vehicles.

Incredibly, the owner of the Lamborghini decided not to come forward and provide the correct paperwork so the police put it up for sale at auction.

It went under the hammer at the Manheim auction house’s Colchester sale with the winning bidder paying £218,000. The auction house said it was the most expensive police seized vehicle that they had sold.

Seized: Police took this Lamborghini because it was uninsured and being driven without a licence - and amazingly the owner never came forward to claim it so it was sold

The aggressive-looking Lamborghini Aventador is the Italian car maker’s latest supercar and is powered by a 6.5-litre V12 engine.

This gives it a 0-62mph time of just 2.9 seconds and a top speed of 217mph - making it one of the world’s fastest supercars.

The money from the sale will go to funding frontline policing in the capital.

Operation Cubo was launched by the Met Police commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe in October 2012.

Over the past six months, police have seized a number of flash supercars including two from the Qatari Royal Family.

One of these, a Tron-style purple Lamborghini Aventador, was put on show outside the force’s New Scotland Yard as a deterrent.

Officers involved in the crackdown have seized more than 11,500 cars in 12 months.
