A prominent young activist has been charged with assaulting a guard during a Ferguson-related protest just days after meeting with President Barack Obama at the White House.

Rasheen Aldridge, 20, the youngest member of the newly-established Ferguson Commission, was part of a group that rushed the doors at St. Louis City Hall, Missouri, police said.

Video footage posted online show the group shouting, 'We shut s*** down', while storming towards marshals who were blocking the entrance.

The 20-year-old was charged with assault along with two other demonstrators, Zachary Chasnoff from St Louis and Chelsea Carswell from Austin, Texas. 

Hundreds took to the streets Hall last week as part of a protest over a St. Louis County grand jury's decision to not indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in Michael Brown's shooting death.

A police spokesman said: 'Several individuals rushed the doors at City Hall, attempting to gain entry. 

The 20-year-old was charged with third degree assault along with two other demonstrators

'The individuals broke the door and C.U, a City Marshall, stood at the door, blocking the individuals from entering City Hall. The defendant was among the individuals attempting to gain entry to City Hall. 

'While C.U. was blocking entry, Defendant and the other individuals were chanting and shouting at C.U. and others posted at the door. Defendant and the other individuals continued to attempt to gain entry to City Hall and Defendant pushed C.U.'

On Monday, Aldridge and fellow commission member Brittany Packnett were in Washington to visit Mr Obama. 

'One of the most powerful things that happened today was I had the opportunity to meet with some young people, including a couple of young outstanding leaders from the Ferguson community, Brittany Packnett and Rasheen Aldridge,' said the US president.

'And what made me concerned was the degree to which they feel as if they are not heard or that the reality of what they experienced has been denied. 

The member of Young Activists United admitted he was hesitant to accept an appointment to the commission

'What made me greatly encouraged was how clear their voices were when they were heard, and how constructive they are in wanting to solve these problems. And I think anybody who had the chance to listen to them here today felt the same way.'

Aldridge said he was 'disappointed' with the president after their meeting because he didn't commit to action in Ferguson.

The member of Young Activists United admitted he was hesitant to accept an appointment to the commission.

'That was the most difficult part, to make sure I'm not turning my back on my people or betraying them or doing any backdoor deals because like I said at the end of the day, I stand with them,' he said.

The 16-person panel of the Ferguson Commission has been appointed to study and make specific recommendations for how to make progress on the issues raised by events in Ferguson. 

In a written statement, Ferguson Commission co-chairs Rich McClure and Rev Starsky Wilson said: 'We do not have a lot of information on the situation with Rasheen Aldridge Junior and the misdemeanor charge stemming from an incident at city hall last week. We hope to have a chance to talk to him to understand the facts. Rasheen is a valued member of the Ferguson commission.'
