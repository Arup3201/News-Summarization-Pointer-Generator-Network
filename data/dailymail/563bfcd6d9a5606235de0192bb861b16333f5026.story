A 54-year-old man convicted of sexually assaulting an 11-year-old boy in Ohio has been caught working as a Santa Claus at a Texas McDonald's.

Norman Burbank was sentenced to 12 years prison for the 1992 rape of the child, but recently moved to Baytown, east of Houston.

On Saturday police received an anonymous tip the sex offender was acting as Santa Claus at the fast food restaurant and had children in his lap, according to Click 2 Houston, along with a photo of him taken on a cell phone.

However, after being arrested and detained by police, Burbank was let go, after authorities determined he had not violated any laws by putting on the red suit.

Detained: Norman Burbank, 54, was taken into custody Saturday at a McDonald's store in Baytown, following an anonymous call. He is seen here in a photo from his Facebook (left) and a police mug shot (right)

Snap: A customer at the McDonald's is believed to have taken this picture of Burbank working at the store and sent it to police, who then handcuffed him and took him into custody

Scene: The restaurant released a statement about the incident saying they are investigating 

Unless a sex offender is on parole or probation that that stipulates they stay away from children under 17, it isn't against the law to have dealings with children.

'What's right isn't always legal,' legal analyst Brian Wice told the station. 

'And what's legal isn't always right.'

Local police seemed just as surprised.

'Him putting on a Santa Claus costume and having children in his lap, however unsettling that is for parents to hear, it was not a violation of Texas law,' Eric Freed from the Baytown Police Department told Click 2 Houston.

Burbank was approached by the news outlet at his home.

He answered the door to the camera crew, but told them he had no comment about his detainment or his job. 

'No comment': A local news crew went to Burbank's home in Baytown, but he would not talk about his job as a Santa Claus at McDonald's

Convicted: Norman Burbank (seen in a picture from his Facebook) was sentenced to 12 years in prison in 1998 following the sexual assault of an 11-year-old boy in Ohio

The McDonald's store released a statement about the incident.

However it remains unclear whether any background checks were done before Burbank was assigned the job.

'We take this matter very seriously as the safety of our guests are our top priority,' the statement said.

'We are looking into the situation and gathering all the evidence.'

Under Texas law, there are only a handful of jobs that registered sex offenders are legally not allowed to perform.

They are limousine and bus driver, taxi cab driver and amusement park operator.
