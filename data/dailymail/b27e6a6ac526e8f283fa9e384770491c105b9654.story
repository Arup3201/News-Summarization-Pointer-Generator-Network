Ancient Greece's Venus de Milo, Michaelangelo's David and Vermeer's Girl With A Pearl Earring are all set to appear in a blockbuster show in east London today.

For these reproductions of classic artworks have all been made out of Lego blocks by American artist Nathan Sawaya.

He has brought his his exhibition of Lego sculptures to the UK for the first time after it has been seen by millions of people around the world.

Tearing his art out: Nathan Sawaya stands with his sculpture 'Yellow' at the Art of Brick Exhibition in London

Faithful reproduction: Sawaya's interpretation of Vermeer's Girl With A Pearl Earring

Trippy: In this sculpture entitled 'Computer' a hand reaches eerily out from the screen to use the keyboard

Sawaya's giant colourful statues of skulls, bodies bursting open, dinosaurs and faithful interpretations of classical works have already been seen in New York, Shanghai and Singapore.

Now the former corporate lawyer is showing more than 75 of his artworks in the exhibition The Art Of The Brick which will open, appropriately enough, in Brick Lane in east London on Friday.

More than a million Lego bricks have been assembled into his figures, which include one of his most familiar images in which a human chest is prized apart, with blocks spilling out. 

It took Sawaya almost 4,200 hours to produce his collection, which includes a Tyrannosaurus Rex skeleton which is made up of 80,000 bricks.

Organisers expect the exhibition, due to continue at The Old Truman Brewery venue until January 4 of next year, to be a huge draw.

Contrived and creative: The exhibition is a mixture of Lego recreations of classic works, such as Michaelangelo's David, left, and Sawaya's own work, such as the one shown right

Sawaya has said of his use of Lego: 'Everyone can relate to it since it is a toy that many children have at home. I want to elevate this simple plaything to a place it has never been before.

'I also appreciate the cleanliness of the medium. The right angles. The distinct lines.

'Up close, the shape of the brick is distinctive. But from a distance, those right angles and distinct lines change to curves.'

Carol Stenberg of promoter ExhibiTours said: 'He has taken everyone's favourite iconic toy bricks and has elevated them to an art form that inspires people of all ages.

'Nathan's sculptures are truly amazing and excite the imaginations of everyone who sees them.'
