He said he intended to relax ahead of Wimbledon next week.

And reigning champion Andy Murray looked like he was staying true to his word as he and girlfriend Kim Sears dressed down to take their border terriers Maggie May and Rusty for a walk in the countryside.

The Scot will defend his title at the championships, which start a week today, under the guidance of new coach Amelie Mauresmo. Murray, who 12 months ago became the first British man to win a Wimbledon singles title in 77 years, was left with some unexpected spare time after losing in the third round at Queen’s last week.

Animal lovers: Andy Murray and Kim Sears taking their dogs Rusty and Maggie May for a walk close to their £5 million home in Surrey

The couple looked like any other enjoying the countryside on a balmy day near their £5million mansion in Oxshott, Surrey, as they took the Border Terriers for a walk last Friday.

The pair, who were both dressed-down in t-shirts, trainers and shorts, then piled into a grey Land Rover Defender worth about £25,000.

It is a reasonable sum to spend on a car in comparison to his previous purchases.

In 2012, he was seen driving a silver £85,000 Jaguar XKR convertible through south-west London. It replaced the grey Aston Martin he bought in 2011 for up to £135,000.

And that replaced the red Ferrari F430 he bought before that.

He admitted that the Ferrari was a ‘too flash’ at the time and said he felt like a ‘prat’ driving it, adding: ‘I’m quite a conservative driver, but when I was driving that you’d get beeped for getting out of the car.’

Despite being knocked out of the competition in the third round, Murray returned to Queens Club yesterday for the Rally for Bally exhibition match

Now, it looks like he has made a much more sensible choice and the decision implies that the 27-year-old may be growing up.

He even let his girlfriend of nine years drive him home in a sign he’s settling down to domestic bliss in the home they share.

Discussing his choice of vehicle previously, he said that Miss Sears usually drives a Porsche Cayenne.

He also admitted that he sometimes prefers to go undercover by riding about in the small Volkswagen Polo he bought when he passed his driving test.

‘We had a Ranger Rover Sport which I used to drive and an Aston Martin,’ he told the Mirror.

‘I sold the Aston Martin and we changed the Ranger Rover for a Porsche Cayenne, I don’t really drive that much - my girlfriend drives that.

‘The only other car I have got is a Volkswagen Polo, which is my first car which I have still got. I had it when I passed my test at 21.

Following the frustration of his exit at Queen's Club last week, Murray said he planned to relax and catch up with friends ahead of the start of the defence of his Wimbledon title

‘I drove that to Wimbledon last year [2012]. It is still the car I drive most in. Are people surprised when they see my get out of it?

‘I don’t think many people look to be honest if it’s a Volkswagen Polo. Is it sentimentality? It’s not something I’ve thought much about it.

‘The reason I kept it is because if people come to stay, it’s a good car to pick people up from the station and those sort of things. Because it is my first car, I have kept it - it’s done about 30,000 miles now.’

Last week, as he casually strolled along a country lane, the Wimbledon champion wore a blue t-shirt with trainers emblazoned on it and a pair of trainers designed by Adidas, which is one of his sponsors.

Mr Murray, who won Olympic gold at London 2012, has a £15million five-year deal with the sportswear giant.

Following his Queen’s defeat, he said he planned to relax, catch up with friends and watch the World Cup - and he was obviously telling the truth given their romantic stroll.
