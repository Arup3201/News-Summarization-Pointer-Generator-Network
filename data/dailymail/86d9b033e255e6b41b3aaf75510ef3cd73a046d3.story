Liverpool midfielder Suso has completed his £1million switch to AC Milan on a four-and-a-half-year deal.

The 21-year-old Spaniard was due to be out of contract in the summer but has cut his Anfield stay short by six months.

Suso moved to Liverpool from Spanish side Cadiz CF in 2010 as a youth player and made his debut for the Reds in 2012.

Suso has not played for the Liverpool first team since their Capital One Cup penalty shoot-out win over Middlesbrough at Anfield on September 23. 

The former Spain Under 21 international played 21 first-team games for Liverpool - as well as 33 matches while on loan at Almeria in 2013-14. 

A statement on Liverpool's official website on Saturday read: 'Liverpool FC can confirm that midfielder Suso has today completed a permanent transfer to Italian side AC Milan.

'The 21-year-old Spaniard departs Anfield for Serie A four-and-a-half years after joining the Reds from Cadiz CF.

'Having debuted for the club in a September 2012 Europa League tie, Suso made a total of 21 appearances.

'His first and only goal was scored earlier this season when he struck beyond Middlesbrough in front of the Kop.

'Everybody at Liverpool thanks Suso for his contribution and wishes him all the best for the future.'
