Hot on the heels of Google Glasses, there’s a new device on the block even before the search engine giant has released its new gadget.

Sony is believed to be working on a similar computing glasses product after patent appeared online .

The Japanese electronics maker recently published an application to the US Patent and Trademark office for a head-mounted display apparatus.

Look to the future: Sony has issued a patent for a head-mounted display apparatus

The device is described as ‘A 
head-mounted display apparatus including an image display device, a 
wearing device with which the image display device is worn on a head of 
an observer, and an attachment member with which the image display 
device is attached to the wearing device.

‘The attachment member is capable of adjusting a position of the image display device relative to the wearing device independently in a first direction and in a second direction, the first direction being defined by a virtual line connecting centres of eyes of the observer, the second direction being perpendicular to the first direction and extending vertically with respect to the observer.’

What makes Sony’s device different from Google Glasses is that the user will be able to view information on both eyes as compared to Google’s device where only one eye can view information, according to The Droid Guy.

Head case: Google co-founder Sergey Brin will have competition for the wearable computing market

Based on the prototype drawing, there are ear buds mounted on the arms as well. The lenses are also movable which can be adjusted by the user to get the most comfortable fit.

It’s believed that the device will display 2D content.

Sony is making inroads into the head mounted device market, with augmented reality units already available such as home entertainment devices like the HMZ-T2 Personal 3d Viewer.

Thousands of Google Glasses are set to hit the streets later this year, and it seems that other competitors such as Sony won’t be far behind.
