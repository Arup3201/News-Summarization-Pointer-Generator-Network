Ashley Young has been working up a sweat as he bids to return to full fitness for Manchester United.

The 29-year-old uploaded a determined-looking picture of himself, via his Instagram account, after training with the Red Devils on Monday.

Young has not featured for boss Louis van Gaal's side since August because of a groin/pelvis injury but returned to light training last week and accompanied the image with the caption 'The Hard Work Never Stops #mufc.'

United have had a nightmare start to the season in relation to injuries and have eight players out of action following their 2-1 win against Everton before the international break. 

The return of Young will be a boost to Van Gaal ahead of next Monday's Premier League trip to West Brom.

Along with Young, Michael Carrick, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling are all on the comeback trail while Marouane Fellaini made his first competitive appearance since the first day of the season against Everton.

United are looking to arrange a behind-closed-doors friendly for Carrick this week as he steps up his recovery after damaging ankle ligaments.

The 33-year-old has been out since July and has been working with the club's physios in the hope of making the squad at The Hawthorns.
