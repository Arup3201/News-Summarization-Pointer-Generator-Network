Staring eagerly into the camera, this little toad is full of curiosity as he bobs his eyes above the water and surveys the scene, ready for his close-up.

The photographs were captured by French marine biologist Mathieu Foulquie, 39, after he spotted the friendly toad in the resurgence of a little river near Montpellier, France.

Mr Foulquie was investigating underwater in a river named 'la Bueges' when he put his hand on the river bed and the toad grabbed his fingers.

He says: 'He kept grabbing my hand as I was moving it, and then he became so friendly that he even started following me.

'The little guy just carried on coming towards me, even trying to climb up and hang on me! I assumed this maybe was to have a bit of a rest from swimming.'
