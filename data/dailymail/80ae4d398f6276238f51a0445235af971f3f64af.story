Police have seized scissors and knives from the home of a 21-year-old woman charged with dismembering and strangling her newborn son moments after delivering the baby in the bathroom.

'Horrific crime': Lillian Alvarado, 21, has charged with dismembering her newborn son on Thanksgiving last year

Lillian Alvarado has been ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation after she was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and cruelty to children on Thursday, months after police first stumbled upon the shocking crime in northwest Washington.

Police were first called to Alvarado's apartment in the 6400 block of 14th Street NW on November 28 after downstairs neighbors complained of bloody water dripping from the ceiling.

Authorities said cops arrived at the apartment just before noon on Thanksgiving and that, once Alvarado could be coaxed out of the bathroom, she sat on the bed and said 'forgive me', The Washington Post reported.

It was then police found the dead baby, with umbilical cord still attached, lying in an inch of blood and water in the bathtub, with a pair of scissors in the sink.

Alvarado’s 70-year-old father, Santiago Alvarado, said family members thought his daughter was taking a shower that morning.

He said that she has a history of mental illness and that during episodes, she is unable to communicate.

Alvarado came to the United States from El Salvador about a year ago, the father said, fleeing the violence in her native country, where her husband was killed.

Scene: Lillian Santiago lived with relatives in the 6400 block of 14th Street NW, Washington. Family members said they believed she was showering on the morning on November 28, when the alleged crime occurred

She made a living cleaning houses in the Washington area and 'worked very hard', he said.

Alvarado told her father she didn't know she was pregnant and that the baby was stillborn.

However on Thursday the medical examiner said there were air bubbles found in the infant's lungs, meaning that he had died after the birth.

The autopsy also found that the newborn’s neck had been compressed, and there were signs of drowning.

The cause of death was determined as dismemberment and asphyxiation.

Alvarado told police that she knew she was pregnant in April or May, and she believed that by November she was seven months along, according to court documents obtained by The Post.

She said she woke up at 6 am on Thanksgiving with a sharp pain and told others in the home that she was sick from something she ate.

She later went into the bathroom, where her water broke.

According to the charging documents, Alvarado got into the shower, thinking she was about to go to the hospital, and that the baby was born there.

The affidavit says she told police she cut the umbilical cord with scissors and did not hear the baby cry.

She told police that she remembers hitting her head on the sink as she got out of the tub and flushing the toilet, but then 'everything went dark'.

Relatives told police that Alvarado went in and out of the bathroom all morning, once asking for a pair of pants, another time fetching a plunger from a hall closet.

'This was a horrific crime that occurred on Thanksgiving Day to an innocent child killed by his mother,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Cynthia Wright said at a D.C. Superior Court hearing, arguing that the suspect is a danger to the community.

Santiago Alvarado said his daughter has a history of mental illness.

'She has mental disturbances sometimes, and when that happens, she doesn’t talk,' the father said in Spanish.

'She goes out of her mind. The doctors diagnosed her with a sickness.'

He said he did not know the official diagnosis.

Lillian Alvarado has a two-year-old daughter who was taken by social workers the same day the baby was born, he said.

Santiago Alvarado said that his daughter was hospitalized for about a month after the baby’s death and that he just received a bill for $24,000.

They have not spoken since her arrest.
