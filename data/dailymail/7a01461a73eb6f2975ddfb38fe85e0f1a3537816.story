Soccer great Diego Maradona became a dad again for the fifth time yesterday at the age of 52.

His former lover Veronica Orjeda gave birth by caesarean to a boy called Diego Fernando shortly before midnight in a Buenos Aires hospital.

The World Cup-winning footballer was still in Dubai today where he works as a sports ambassador for the United Arab Emirates.

Veronica Ojeda, right, pictured with Diego Maradona at a tennis match, gave birth to a baby boy named after his famous father on Wednesday. They split when she was four months pregnant

It is not known when he will travel to Argentina to see his new son.

News of the birth was confirmed by Maradona's doctor Alfredo Cahe.

He said: 'He's called Diego Fernando, he was born on February 13 at 11.57pm and he weighs 7lbs.

'Both mother and baby are doing well.'

Maradona split from girlfriend of eight years Ojeda, 33, when she was four and a half months pregnant.

The split coincided with reports in Argentina he had been pressured into ending their relationship by ex wife Claudia Villafane and their two daughters Dalma and Giannina.

Argentine press claimed they were unhappy at the idea of a fifth child having the famous surname and claims to his fortune.

Reports in Argentina said the footballing great had been pressured into the split by ex wife Claudia Villafane, left, and their daughters Giannina, right, and Dalma, second left

The former Barcelona star has a son and daughter from extra-marital affairs who he has no relationship with.

Maradona's family issued a statement rubbishing the claims and insisted that he took his own decisions in life.

Ojeda
went on to have a series of sometimes public rows with his ex-wife and 
two daughters, even taking out a restraining order against Villafane 
after she allegedly threatened her.

His daughter Gianinna split last year from Man City striker husband Sergio Aguero.

Ojeda's lawyer Jorge Auriccio insisted last night that Maradona would recognise their new-born child.

He said: 'Maradona is going to send his recognition of paternity through the embassy.

'He's is going to recognise the child, there won't be a problem.

'He's fully aware of what's going on, of Veronica's state of health and the baby's.

'The baby is beautiful, my impression is that from his nose upwards he looks like Maradona.'

Argentina press suggested the family of Maradona, pictured lifting the 1986 World Cup, were concerned about the baby having his famous name and claims on his fortune made as one world's greatest ever footballers
