Disturbing images and recruitment messages posted on the social media accounts of two notorious Australian jihadists reveal a horrifying glimpse into Islamic extremist groups fighting in Iraq and Syria.

Convicted terrorist Khaled Sharrouf - a member of breakaway al-Qaeda group Islamic State -  posted a photo of a child brandishing an assault rifle and issued a call-to-arms for other Australian Muslims to join their bloody war in the Middle East.

Sharrouf, who left Australia last December to link up with the fundamentalist militia group, tweeted in the early hours of Saturday: 'come and be part of what we have dreamt...for decades'. It was accompanied by a picture of him decked out in army camouflage posing with a gun in front of a white BMW.

It comes after it was revealed that Mohamed Elomar, one of almost 60 Australians fighting for extremist groups in the Middle East, took aim at diggers fighting in Iraq, tweeting: 'Look at the end of these Iraqi maliki dogs bunch of girls can't wait to see a Australia soldier cyring [sic] saying bakia.'

The Sydney Morning Herald reported that 'bakia' meant 'he cries' in Arabic and 'maliki' was a term used to describes the Nouri al-Maliki government, which is led by Shiites. The regime is strongly opposed to Sunni extremists who have torn through Iraq's north in the past few weeks.

Another tweet fired off from Sharrouf read: 'My (provisions) are beneath the shade of my sword. We live better than we lived in our country.'

But these uploads barely scratch the surface of the disturbing content found on Sharrouf's Twitter page.

Earlier posts contain pictures so graphic that Daily Mail Australia has chosen not to describe or publish them.

But one that can be shared is of a young child brandishing a gun and smiling with the caption: 'One of dawlas [sic] youngest members' - which was posted late May. Dawlah is Arabic for country or state.

Other photos show Sharrouf standing in front of military vehicles as well as fundamentalist propaganda memes.

He told people to 'come and be part of what we have dreamt For for decades' and said: 'we live better than we lived in our country '

Sharrouf often posts propaganda memes including this one in which he mocks Abu Mariya, an officer of Syrian jihadist group Jabhat Al-Nusra Shari'i - which fights against Bashar al-Assad's regime

On Thursday, Elomar - a former Sydney boxer and Islamic State jihadist - made his threat against Diggers on his Twitter account accompanied by a picture of a weeping Iraqi soldier who had been taken hostage before he was beaten and executed.

In response to Elomar's outburst, Sharrouf tweeted: 'Allah...says "kill them where ever you find them"....'

These tweets come just days after the Australian Government said almost 60 Australians fight for Islamic radicals in Iraq and Syria, while about 150 Australians were being monitored for supporting terrorist organisations, recruiting fighters or preparing to travel overseas to fight.

This information was revealed after Sydney teenager Abdullah Elmir became the third Australian teenager to walk out on his family in June bound for Iraq.

It is believed Abdullah, 17, was recruited by an Islamic extremist group to fight in the troubled war zone.

He went missing from his family's Bankstown home - in Western Sydney - almost two weeks ago, and has only been heard from once when he contacted his mother to say he was in Turkey.

Ten Australians have died while fighting for extremists in Syria and Iraq.

The latest is a 22-year-old Sydney man, Zakaria Raad, who appeared in a recruitment video for the terror group Islamic State - formerly known as the 'Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant' and 'Islamic State of Iraq and Syria' - shortly before he was ambushed in Syria.

In one of the recruitment videos entitled There Is No Life Without Jihad, an Australian man who calls himself Abu Yahya ash Shami said he wanted to send 'a message...from a Muslim brother's heart to another brother's heart'.

He appeals to Australian Muslims to come join him in the Middle East to restore 'honour' in the region, saying: 'Wake up, wake up and be part of this effort.'

A second Australian, Abu Nour al Iraqi, also appears in the video in a balaclava.

He said the 'inequities' in the west - including Australia - was one of the reasons to come and fight with him.

'There reasons for coming to jihad - the reasons are plenty,' the masked man said.

The former Sydney resident fled from Australia in December - believed to be going to Syria - on his brother's passport

Sharrouf also tweeted a photo of one his Islamic State brothers called Abu Suhaib Tunasi Wallah who was 'one of the best brother I know...'

An ISIS recruitment video titled There Is No Life Without Jihad showed five extremists, including this Australian on the left, urging people to 'respond to Allah' and 'wake up and be part of the effort'
