Blackpool have performed a U-turn in appointing a new manager after deciding against employing Brian Flynn.

The Seasiders have been without a permanent boss since Paul Ince’s sacking in January and the former Wrexham boss was set to take over at Bloomfield Road.

But Sportsmail understands that Flynn’s failure to promptly assemble his backroom staff and the club’s worry surrounding fans’ opinion means they’ve decided to pull the plug.

Staying put: Blackpool have decided against appointing Brian Flynn as their new manager

Dumped: Paul Ince was sacked by the Seasiders in January after a disastrous run of results

The 58-year-old has been director of football at Doncaster Rovers after spurning the opportunity to continue in a managerial role at the Keepmoat Stadium when they won promotion two years ago, instead preferring to move upstairs.

Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston is thought to have a handful of candidates he remains interested in. Whoever gets the job has a huge task on their hands.

Under caretaker manager Barry Ferguson they narrowly avoided relegation from the Championship to League One in the final weeks of last season and are a club in disarray with only six contracted players on their books.
