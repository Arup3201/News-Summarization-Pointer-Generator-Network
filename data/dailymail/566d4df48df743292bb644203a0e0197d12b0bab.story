It is a new retail giant that promises to fix everything from a  broken mobile phone to a  leaking dishwasher.

The merger of Dixons and Carphone Warehouse has created a £3.8billion technology goliath.

Bosses claim it will operate like a household ‘emergency’ service, while continuing to sell electronics.

The Carphone Warehouse and Dixons have announced a merger to create a £3.8billion retail giant that will also specialise in fixing every gadget and home appliance

They say the deal is a response to a technical revolution that will allow smartphones to become the remote control for the home, performing a range of tasks such as switching on the central heating and receiving alerts when milk is going off in the fridge.

Consequently, they argue it is only sensible to bring these elements together under one roof.

The deal has triggered suspicions that the newly merged company will cut costs by closing stores and sacking staff where there are outlets close to each other in town centres.

However, the group claims the new business, which will be called Dixons Carphone and employs 43,000 people across Europe, will end up with around 900 more. It is unclear whether the store names will change.

Company bosses say merger is in response to technology revolution that will lead to smartphones becoming remote controls for the home

Under one scenario, the firm might charge a monthly fee to ensure all the household devices are working properly.

Carphone boss Andrew Harrison, who will be the deputy chief executive of the merged group, said he envisaged a ‘nationwide fleet of people to be able to go and solve things’.

He added: ‘It may be that we know before they do.

‘It may be that we have someone turning up at your house to tell you your boiler’s broken or your internet connectivity’s not working as it should be.

‘What seems outlandish today will become absolutely ubiquitous in the next few years.’

Mr Harrison insisted the deal reflected major changes in the way technology is used in the home.

‘This is a merger that is ahead of the curve and is thinking about how the world changes for our customers,’ he said.

He added that as people’s homes became ‘smarter’ the business will help to sell heating, lighting, and security and fitness systems, on top of its present lines of electrical products.

Some customers, however, may struggle with the new concept, given the reputation of staff at Dixons. In the past, at least, they have been ridiculed for a lack of knowledge and a hard-sell approach.

The merger aims to tap into a growing market for household devices connected to the internet via wifi. The number of such gadgets in each home is predicted to rise from a current average of four to 20 in the next few years.

The merger will also provide greater muscle to tackle the threat to traditional retailers posed by specialist web firms such as Amazon.

But City analyst Louise Cooper said there was ‘likely to be much scepticism’. In a withering put-down, she added: ‘Two past-their-sell-by-date retailers merging does not an Amazon make.’

Sebastian James of Dixons, who will become the chief executive of the merged group, responded by pointing out the contrast with Amazon, which bizarrely claims to make little or no profit in the UK despite generating billions in sales. He said: ‘We do make profits … and pay tax’.

The merger is expected to deliver combined yearly savings of £80million, although there will be restructuring costs of £55million to £60million and extra investment of £70million to £80million.

The chairman will be Carphone founder Charles Dunstone, who said: ‘We have a deep respect for each other and we see the merger of these two great companies as an opportunity to bring our skills together for the consumer  and create a new retailer for the digital age.'
