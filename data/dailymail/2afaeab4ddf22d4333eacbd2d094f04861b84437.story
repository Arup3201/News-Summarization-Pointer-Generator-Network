Europe faces a crucial 10 days to save the euro zone after agreeing to ramp up the firepower of its bailout fund.

Euro zone ministers agreed last night detailed plans to leverage the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSF), but warned they may have to turn to the IMF for more help to avert financial disaster.

Olli Rehn, Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner, said: 'We are now entering the critical period of 10 days to complete and conclude the crisis response of the European Union.'

Italian and Spanish bond yields resumed their inexorable climb towards unsustainable levels on today, as markets assessed the rescue fund boost as inadequate.

Optimism: Global markets rebounded today despite the failure of European finance ministers - including British Chancellor George Osborne, left, Spanish finance minister Elena Salgado and French budget minister Francois Baroin - to agree radical plans to halt the debt crisis

It comes as stock markets rose 
after buoyant consumer confidence figures renewed optimism in the 
strength of the U.S. economy.

Early
trading was down, but a raft of 
economic data from the U.S. over the rest of the week, including 
non-farm payroll figures on Friday, raised hopes the world's largest 
economy is faring better than expected.

The news saw the FTSE 100 index climb 0.8 per cent at 5,379.8, while Germany's DAX rose 1.2 per cent to 5,870.

Wall Street was also heading for a 
higher opening - Dow futures rose 0.7 per cent to 11,642 and S&P 500
futures climbed 0.8 per cent at 1,206.

A
decision on how to forge a closer fiscal union between the 17 eurozone 
countries has now been postponed until the leaders' summit next week.

European
finance ministers did agree to had out 8 billion euros to Greece as 
part of its bailout to stem an immediate cash crisis, but they shelved 
more difficult issues - such as whether countries should cede some 
control over their finances to a central European authority.

Stocks had been relatively buoyant this week on the expectation that the 17 countries in the eurozone would finally come up with a plan to deal with the debt crisis.

Ben Critchley, sales trader at IG Index, said: 'With the longer term outlook for the U.S. economy becoming increasingly bullish, expectations are for a robust set of numbers to be seen in the days ahead.'

Major banks around the globe took coordinated action to ease the strain on the world's financial system, saying they would make it easier for banks to get dollars if needed.

The European Central Bank, U.S. Federal Reserve, Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Japan and Switzerland took part.

As the eurozone debt crisis spreads, the global economy is showing signs of entering another credit crunch similar to the 2008 collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers.

The central banks said in a joint statement the moves were designed to 'provide liquidity support to the global financial system'.

It said they had agreed to reduce the cost of temporary dollar loans to banks - called liquidity swaps - by a half percentage point from Monday.

Europe's ongoing battle to contain its
debt crisis is likely to remain a key driver in markets for a while to 
come, especially if countries continue having to pay elevated interest 
rates to get investors to lend them money.

Yesterday,
Italy was forced to pay a high interest rate on an auction of 
three-year debt. The 7.89 per cent rate was nearly three percentage 
points higher than last month.

If Italy was to default on its debt of
1.9trillion euros, the fallout would damage the euro and send shock 
waves throughout the global economy.

Economists
have said the 17 eurozone nations have little choice but to back 
proposals for closer coordination of spending and budget policies.

This would reduce their ability to 
run budget deficits, but could pave the way for more aggressive support 
from the European Central Bank.

Analysts
at Credit Agricole CIB said in a report that 'until concrete and 
detailed plans for a solution to the crisis are announced, the downward 
trend' in stocks will continue.

Ratings downgrades for many of the world's largest banks has also driven away investors.

Standard
& Poor's yesterday lowered its credit ratings for 37 financial 
companies, including Citigroup Inc and HSBC Holdings PLC.
