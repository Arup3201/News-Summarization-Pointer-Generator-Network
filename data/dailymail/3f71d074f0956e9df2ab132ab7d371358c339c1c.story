Under threat: Royal Mail used its first annual financial results announcement to warn that prices may have to rise

Royal Mail could be forced to increase the price of stamps unless the ‘unfettered’ rollout of rival postmen by TNT Post is brought under control, it was feared last night.

It warned that TNT Post’s growth ‘could threaten the fundamental economics of the universal service’ – the rule that requires Royal Mail to deliver six days a week to every address in Britain.

Deliveries have to cost the same whether a letter goes to London or Land’s End. Retaining this service was a key factor in Royal Mail’s sell-off last year.

When it was floated in October, ministers insisted the universal service was protected by law.

But Royal Mail chose the announcement of its first annual financial results as a private company to warn that the requirement was under threat because the firm was losing business to its competitors.

TNT Post is not bound by the universal service and does not have to deliver everywhere in Britain.

Royal Mail said this means it can ‘cherry pick’ lucrative deliveries and locations – only handling business post to large cities such as Manchester.

Within three years, TNT Post’s expansion could cost Royal Mail more than £200million a year in lost business, it said.

This would have to be recouped, leading to fears that the price of a stamp could rise – raising the prospect of £1 for first-class deliveries.

A first-class stamp already costs 62p, up from 30p in 2005.

TNT Post, which was launched in 2012, can avoid the unprofitable deliveries Royal Mail legally has to make.

TNT can 'cherry pick' lucrative deliveries and locations rather than keep universal prices across Britain

It says its 3,000 orange-liveried postmen could be serving more than 40 per cent of British households by 2018.

Around 70 per cent of business letters, such as bank statements and gas bills, are now handled by one of Royal Mail’s rivals.

Royal Mail chief executive Moya Greene yesterday called on postal regulator Ofcom to investigate TNT Post’s cherry-picking of what she called easy-to-serve urban areas.

She added: ‘We do not believe the current situation serves the best interests of consumers. I’ve still got to have that postman on that walk whether he has got two items to deliver or 2,002.

‘Without timely intervention from the regulator, direct delivery competition will have a serious impact on the sustainability of the universal service.’

Part of the sell-off deal was the requirement that all letters would cost the same across the country

But Ofcom said: ‘We do not believe there is presently a threat to the financial sustainability of the universal postal service.’

It announced plans for a review in March last year, although it will not take place until the end of 2015. Royal Mail insists it should take place immediately.

TNT Post chief executive Nick Wells said: ‘It’s time to stop  complaining and get on with promoting the postal sector in spite of the trend towards digital communications.’

The row comes as Royal Mail revealed it was making profits before tax equal to around £1million a day. It delivers 58million letters and parcels daily, with plans to trial the delivery of parcels on a Sunday this summer.

Yesterday, its shares fell 9.7 per cent to close at £5.19 – the biggest faller in the FTSE index of Britain’s top 100 firms – amid fears about the threat posed by TNT Post. It floated at £3.30.
