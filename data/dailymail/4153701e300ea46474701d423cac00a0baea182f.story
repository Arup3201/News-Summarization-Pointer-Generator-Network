A California man accused of murdering his 6-week-old baby girl last year had allegedly tortured the special needs child nearly from birth, it was revealed during a Wednesday court hearing.

Aaron Rowe, 23, of Visalia, has been charged with a single count of murder with a special circumstance of torture, which is punishable by the death penalty or a life sentence without parole. 

Rowe's 22-year-old wife, Courtney, faces a charge of failure to protect a child from abuse, with a special allegation of willful harm to a child.

Potential punishment: If convicted of murder, Mr Rowe could face the death penalty or life without parole

Both parents were ordered Wednesday to stand trial in connection to the November 2012 slaying of their infant daughter, Peyton, The Fresno Bee reported.

On the night of November 12, 2012, police officers responded to the home of Aaron and Courtney Rowe after getting a report of a baby not breathing.

Little Peyton, who was born with a genetic condition known as the Turner syndrome known to cause deformities, was taken to Kaweah Delta Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead.

An autopsy performed on the child two days later showed that the cause of death was blunt force trauma, and that the 6-week-old girl had old injuries consistent with prolonged abuse, according to the TV station ABC30.

The shocking revelations resulted in the arrests of Aaron and Courtney Rowe the following day.

In court yesterday, doctors recounted seeing five separate bruises on the newborn's arms, legs and face. CT scans showed that the infant suffered 15 fractured ribs and several other old and new fractures to her bones. 

The prosecution painted the 23-year-old father as violent man who had allegedly tortured the helpless newborn baby for about two weeks by shaking and beating her.

The night after Peyton's killing, Aaron Rowe reportedly went out to party with friends.

Records show that in 2011, Mr Rowe was sentenced to 90 days in jail on a domestic violence charge.

Mr Rowe’s attorney, Andy Rubinger, has denied allegations that his client was abusive toward his daughter, saying that on one occasion, he fell while holding Peyton in his arms, but that is was an accident.

The lawyer added that the 23-year-old defendant loved Peyton as much as he loves his wife and their older daughter.

Courtney Rowe was seen weeping in court during Wednesday's hearing. Prosecutors in the case have argued that the mother had to have known the abuse her child was suffering, but she had done nothing to stop it.

Her attorney insisted that the young mother loved her infant daughter, dutifully taking her to the pediatrician for checkups every week of her short life.

Legal process: Aaron Rowe (left) is being held without bail, while his wife (right) had her bail lowered to $100,000 ahead of their arraignment scheduled for next week

‘There is absolutely no evidence that the prosecution has shown that she'd failed to protect that baby,’ attorney Sarah Bratsch told the station. 

Mr Rowe is being held without bail. Courtney Rowe’s bail was reduced from $250,000 to $100,000. Their arraignment was scheduled for July 23.
