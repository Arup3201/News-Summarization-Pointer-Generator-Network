It is where the rich, powerful and influential choose to live away from the spotlight.

But the well-heeled neighbourhood in North London, where the imposing detached houses start at £5million, is now the setting for an up-market spat over a newcomer’s plans to build an underground swimming pool.

A group of residents in Hampstead Garden Suburb, including Lord Justice Leveson, TV presenter Richard Madeley and former banking boss Sir Victor Blank, are worried that the development may damage their nearby homes.

Former Lloyds chairman Sir Victor –  heavily criticised in the credit crunch for pushing through the disastrous takeover of ailing Halifax Bank of Scotland in 2008 – has now instructed lawyers to try to obtain a High Court injunction to ban work on the six-bed mansion until comprehensive surveys are carried out on the impact of the basement excavation.

City derivatives trader Scott Franklin bought his home for £4.87million last year and lodged a planning application with Barnet Council.

It involves creating a basement under the existing patio and lawn to house a pool and changing room measuring almost 15 metres, and a games room and wine cellar stretching a similar distance.

But neighbours want tests to check the potential impact of Mr Franklin’s plans on underground water levels and what effect this may have on their properties.

They say a similar basement excavation in the area has left one home close to collapse.

Sir Victor, 70, is bringing the legal action after concerns raised by around a dozen neighbours, including the judge who led the Leveson inquiry into media standards and former This Morning presenter Mr Madeley.

At her home close to Mr Franklin’s yesterday, Lady Blank said: ‘They need to get a geological survey done.

‘All we want is for them to make sure that we’re not in danger. We have the River Fleet going through here.

‘All we’ve asked for them to do is make sure that they have the right tests done – the geological tests – around their property because what they’re trying to do is put a large basement on a small garden and this is on a hill.’

Asked why the dispute was going to the High Court, Lady Blank said: ‘To get the right information so, if permission is given, our houses are not affected either by water being diverted into our back gardens or that it will be dried up because this is clay soil.

‘We’re not nasty people, you know if somebody wants to build something it’s fine...you need to do research and if there is a problem we have to know how to deal with it.’

Asked why the dispute was going to the High Court, Lady Blank said: ‘I’ll leave that to your imagination.’

Asked how long the dispute had been going on, Lady Blank said: ‘Since they moved in.’ A spokesman for Lord Justice Leveson said: ‘The judge is not a party to or connected to the legal action. He has no comment to make on the legal action or the circumstances.’

Sir Victor’s lawyers go to court later this month to try to get an injunction to stop the Hampstead Garden Suburb Trust from approving the scheme until further notice.

The Trust, set up in 1968 to preserve the character of the area, rules on every development in the conservation area alongside Barnet Council.

It has signed an agreement pledging to make no decision before the High Court hearing.

Trust chairman Angus Walker said: ‘There are legal proceedings which will be heard in February and the trust has no comment in anticipation of those proceedings.’

Mr Franklin, 39, who lives with his wife Melissa, declined to comment yesterday but said he was happy for the court to make a judgment.

Barnet Council said it had received two planning applications for the site.

A spokesman said one was being considered and the other was being appealed.

It was founded at the start of the 20th century as a ‘model community for people of all classes living together in beautiful houses’.

The beauty of Hampstead Garden Suburb undoubtedly remains but – with its houses now costing anywhere between £5million and £50million – it has become the preserve of the powerful and the famous.

The area’s appeal owes much to Henrietta Barnett, the vicar’s wife who wanted to build better housing for the poor. She set up a trust which initially bought land owned by Eton College. Her aim was that ‘the houses will not be put in uniform lines nor in close relationship’ and not be built without ‘consideration for picturesque appearance’.

Areas of woodland, hedgerows and mature trees were to be retained and work began in 1907, with the development soon spreading on to more land. Cottages were built for rent at low rates, but after the Great War rising costs ended the ability of the private sector to offer such housing.

From then on the trust ensured coherence in design but the houses went to more affluent buyers.

Residents now include King Constantine of Greece, Prince William’s godfather, Lord Winston the surgeon and scientist, and TV host Jonathan Ross.
