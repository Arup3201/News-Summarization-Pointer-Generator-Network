Former Oklahoma running back Brennan Clay is continuing to publicly accuse his wife of cheating on him with college team-mate and Dallas Cowboys star DeMarco Murray, now posting what he claims are intimate text messages between the two to Twitter.

And he says there are more are to come.

Clay played alongside Murray for the University of Oklahoma Sooners in the 2010 season, but announced to the world this week that his wife of just five months, Gina D'Agostini, is having an affair with Murray.

Ex-Oklahoma Sooners running back Clay (pictured in 2013) has publicly claimed his wife of just five months is cheating on him with the Cowboys star

Taking it a step further on Thursday night, the 22-year-old revealed explicit texts he allegedly found in his wife's phone, including one about the two having sex in his own bed, according to Gawker. 

Clay said the text conversation happened on October 5, once he left to go to training for the San Diego Chargers.

After saying goodbye to Clay at the airport, D'Agostini appears to text the 26-year-old Murray, saying that her 'roomate(sic)' has gone.

Clay claims his wife disguised Murray's number in her phone by saving it under 'Spray Tan'.

'So I can f*** u in your bed now?' Murray allegedly wrote back.

'Is that where you want to f*** me? And yes,' D'Agostino allegedly replied.

Clay took to Twitter on December 4 to air his views about wife's alleged antics with Murray

Clay also shared screenshots of D'Agostini's phone as 'proof' of affair of her affair with Murray

Clay also posted his ironic amusement at the fact that D'Agostini saved Murray's name under 'Spray Tan'

To further prove his point, Clay also posted another screen shot of his wife's phone, showing the 'Spray Tan' number to have an area code of Las Vegas, where Murray is from. 

His online rant first started on Sunday, saying he found more than 50 'inappropriate' texts. 

'So Demarco Murray was having an affair with my wife...I'm done...' Clay wrote  to his nearly 25,000 followers.

Clay did not specify how long he believes his wife and the NFL player were together, nor did he say whether the affair has ended.

However, he did offer a couple of reasons their alleged affair is so wrong.

'1 has a baby momma and she has 2 kids,' he wrote. Michigan native D'Agostini does not have children with Clay. Murray has a baby with former Passions actress Heidi Mueller.

Clay failed to mention what might make such an affair so painful for him, besides the obvious feeling of betrayal: he and D'Agostini have been married just five months according to a Facebook profile that appears to belong to him.

Clay did not fail to convey how he feels about the alleged breach of trust, however.

'I'm disgusted...' Clay wrote, before heading off for some spiritual consolation.

'On that note headed to church,' he tweeted before his account went silent for a few hours.

Clay played for the Sooners for four seasons starting in 2010, Murray's last year on the team, the New York Post reports. He went on to go to training camp with the Broncos but was let go in August.

His more successful former teammate Murray was selected in the third round of the 2011 draft by the Cowboys, where he remains today.

Murray had not responded to the accusations as of Sunday evening. 

D'Agostini makes a living as a fitness instructor in Dallas, according to her Facebook page.
