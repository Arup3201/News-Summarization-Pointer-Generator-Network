In a week of unusual detente in the sometimes strained world of Anglo-Russian relations, Prince Charles warmly greeted media magnate Alexander Lebedev at the opening of an extraordinary exhibition which sees the return of 70 masterpieces from Sir Robert Walpole’s art collection to the magnificent Palladian mansion originally built to house it.

Mr Lebedev is standing trial in Moscow on charges of ‘hooliganism motivated by political hatred’ arising from an incident in which he punched fellow businessman Sergei Polonsky during the recording of a television programme in Moscow in 2011.

However, he was given special dispensation by the judge to attend the event at Houghton Hall, near King’s Lynn, Norfolk, home of the 7th Marquess of Cholmondeley.

The charges are inspired by a desire within the Kremlin to punish him for funding investigations into official corruption and for his co-ownership of Novaya Gazeta, an investigative newspaper in Moscow.

Mr Lebedev is a patron of Houghton Revisited, a unique opportunity to view the art collection of Britain’s first Prime Minister.

It includes works by Rubens, Rembrandt, Van Dyck, Frans Hals, Velazquez and Veronese, displayed in their original setting for the first time in 230 years.

After Walpole’s death, his collection was sold to Catherine the Great of Russia to settle his dissolute grandson’s debts.

They have been kept ever since in St Petersburg’s Hermitage Museum, which has lent the paintings for the exhibition.

Mr Lebedev told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I am very happy to be a patron of this amazing event where the cultures of my country and Britain are brought together in spectacular fashion.

‘Next week I will be fighting for my liberty in what I feel is one of the most unjust trials imaginable. I only hope common sense will prevail.’

lHoughton Revisited: Masterpieces From The Hermitage opens on Friday at Houghton Hall, Norfolk, and runs until September 29.
