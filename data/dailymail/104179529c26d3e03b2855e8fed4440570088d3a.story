They're the 'Holy Grail' of muscle cars and 'Fast N' Loud' host Richard Rawlings has discovered the first prototypes ever built hidden away in a Connecticut garage.

Called '#1' and '#2' the cars are the prototype models Pontiac engineers used as the base for the 1967 Firebird.

Upon its release, the Firebird completely changed the way 'muscle cars' were seen.

'We found the cars in a garage in Connecticut,' says Rawlings. 'They 
were in a dilapidated barn and are the very first Firebirds . . . they 
were hand-made . . . and were used by GM to decide if they wanted to 
build the Firebird.'

The New York Post reports that Discovery will air two special editions of 'Fast N' Loud' on April 21 and April 28 detailing how his crew restored each automobile.

The cars, purchased for a combined $65,000, sold for $650,000. Each underwent approximately $200,000 in restoration.

Rawling's was tipped off about the Firebirds by a client who had just purchased a 'pretty rare Corvette.'

'I always have a habit of asking, ‘Do you have anything you want to 
sell?’ He told me he heard a story about a guy a couple of towns over 
who was supposed to have the [Firebirds],' he said. 'A lot of times it 
turns out to be a ghost story — a ‘cool car’ turns out to be a four-door
 Nova.'

Though an incredible find the cars were still in need of quite a bit of love.

Richard Rawlings and Aaron Kaufman were able to sell the cars for $650,000 after giving them a massive restoration

'They were really beaten down and were rusted out, with their motors laying off to the side,' Rawling's said. 'The [owner] was never going to restore them, so we made him a pretty heft offer and the game was on.

'I wanted to sell them as they were,' he added. 'But somebody found out and word
 spread quickly before the cars even got back to Texas [where the show 
is based].

'A guy wanted them fully restored to use as the centerpieces 
of a Pontiac museum in North Dakota, and he wanted them done in 60 
days. A full restoration for a regular shop would take a year
 or year-and-a-half, but we finished both cars in 60 days.'

Rawlings believes this may be the biggest recent discovery in collectible cars.

'To me, this is one of the biggest muscle-car finds in the last 20 
years,' he said. 'These cars were thought to have been long gone.'
