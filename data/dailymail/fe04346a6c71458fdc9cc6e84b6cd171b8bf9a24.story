If you like the look of Google Glass, but hate its $1,500 (£1,000) price tag, then this alternative may soon be able to meet your fashion needs.

Dubbed the Fun’iki glasses, the $150 (£90) device lights up in different colours to send alerts about new messages, phone calls and app activity.

The glasses feature different modes of flashing lighting for different situations, ranging from ‘disco’ and ‘party’ to ‘relax.’

It even lets you send messages in Morse code. You can type in the text into an app and the glasses will flash with the message.

The 1.2oz (38.5g) device was spotted by Engadget at CNET’s Japan Live 2014 event and is expected to go on sale later this year.

As well as lighting up when there is a notification, Fun’iki can also emit a beep so that wearers never miss a text again.

The glasses themselves are powered by USB rechargeable Li-ion batteries and include an automated light sensor that adjusts the brightness of LED

The LEDs are embedded into the frame itself, which means it should be possible to create a pair of prescription lenses for the frame.

‘Sometimes, it’s considered impolite to check a mobile or take out a smart phone during business scene, but you won’t miss any important information from now on without touching a mobile,’ Tokyo-based Matilde, who created the device, wrote on its website.

Yesterday, more than two years after Google launched its Glass Explorer scheme in the U.S, the programme was finally made it available to gadget fans in the UK.

Now any British resident aged over 18 can buy a Glass prototype from the official website for £1,000 - as long as they have a valid credit card.

But with such a steep price tag, the Fun’iki glasses may just prove to be a fashionable alternative.
