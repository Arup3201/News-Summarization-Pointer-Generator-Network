Almost 600 patients are dying in hospitals each year because of hunger and thirst, figures show.

Bereaved relatives have told how their loved ones were ‘forgotten to death’ by staff who refused to help them eat or drink.

Figures from the Office for National Statistics reveal that 7,949 deaths have been attributed to hunger and thirst in the past decade.

In recent years, however, numbers have fallen – suggesting the standards of nursing care are showing signs of improvement.

The figures show that in NHS and private hospitals in 2013, dehydration was recorded as an underlying cause of death or a contributory factor in 574 deaths. In 2008 the total was 942.

In 2013 a further 336 deaths were logged with malnutrition being an underlying cause or contributory factor. The two figures cannot be added together to give a total because some patients would have been recorded in both categories.

Another 88 deaths in care homes in 2013 were attributed to dehydration and 33 to malnutrition, according to the figures which were obtained by Channel 4 News. The family of a retired engineer who died of acute dehydration have told how staff dumped drinks by his bed without bothering to help him reach them.

Stanley Mack, 77, was admitted to Selly Oak Hospital in Birmingham with a chest infection and was later diagnosed with the superbug Clostridium difficile.

He died three weeks later in July 2008 and, during his final days, his family say hospital staff failed to realise he was rapidly deteriorating. His widow Carol said last night: ‘There was no record that was reliable of what he was being given.

‘He would be given drinks and they would be left there and occasionally they would be written up as given to him, but we knew when we were there that he was not drinking it.

‘However, it was described, it wasn’t run in a way that met the patient’s needs. And of course, because of that his condition was allowed to deteriorate and particularly, for him to become acutely dehydrated.’

The family have endured a five-year legal battle with the hospital to try to get to the bottom of exactly how the pensioner died. An initial inquest returned a narrative verdict – suggesting no-one was at fault. But the family appealed for a second inquest in 2013 which ruled Mr Mack had died from dehydration.

Speaking to Channel 4 News, his widow added: ‘The legal challenges that we faced along the way were very, very considerable but we felt we just had to persist. Really to do justice to Stan’s memory. And we just didn’t want other people to have the same experience.’

His son Ian said: ‘I think in this case my dad was forgotten completely. It was the hospital’s job to get the basics right and very clearly they failed. He was absolutely forgotten to death.

‘There was a whole range of things that should have happened monitoring hydration and nutrition and other things which simply didn’t happen. Something went very badly wrong at Selly Oak Hospital.’
