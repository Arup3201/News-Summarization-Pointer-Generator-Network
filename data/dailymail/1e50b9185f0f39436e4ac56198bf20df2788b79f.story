The family of a pedestrian who was mowed down and killed by a 91-year-old has questioned why the elderly man was allowed behind the wheel.

Brenda Forster, 89, was hit by Thomas Craig's car at a pedestrian crossing after he failed to notice a red light.

The retired taxi driver was handed a suspended jail sentence after pleading guilty to causing death by dangerous driving in the accident in June last year.

Miss Forster's daughter said in a statement read out at North Tyneside magistrates' court: 'I feel angry that someone of 91 was still driving, but feel I can't criticise too much because my mum was still driving at 89, albeit against my wishes.'

She added: 'I do feel very sorry for the driver and think about how he must be feeling. I would not want him to suffer – I just want his licence taken away from him so he can't drive again.' 

Motorists over the age of 70 must reapply for a licence every three years, but there is no medical examination required. Instead, applicants are asked to declare medical conditions and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency may request more information. The court heard Craig does not intend to apply for a licence again.

The DVLA claims there is no evidence older motorists cause more accidents.

But the case follows a warning last month from Judge Stephen Holt who told elderly drivers to 'face up to facts' if they are no longer safe on the roads. He was sentencing a woman of 84 who killed an 80-year-old man in a head-on crash.

Helen Harrison, prosecuting, said Ms Forster had been on her way to some local shops at the time.

She said: 'The collision occurred at a pedestrian crossing, fitted with pedestrian-operated traffic signals. There is also zig-zag markings on the approaches from both sides.

'The deceased spoke to her daughter on the phone from her home address at 10am.

'Her daughter said it was a normal conversation and there were no issues or concerns but it was not known what her intentions were for later in the day.

'Just prior to the collision, Ms Forster parked her car on Armstrong Drive, outside the local shops.

'She walked the short distance to a nearby pedestrian crossing where she pressed the button for the traffic lights.

'She paused at the curb edge before attempting to cross the road in a normal or safe manner.'
