It has taken even more bravery than is needed to climb into the ring for Amir Khan, as a devout Muslim, to denounce the extremist barbarity which has now brought slaughter to the streets of Paris in the perverted name of religion.

It required greater courage still for this British hero of Pakistani origin to travel to strife-torn Peshawar to help inspire the rebuilding of the school in which 132 children were among those massacred by militant Islamist gunmen.

All sane citizens of this country should be deeply grateful to a young public figure of such risky prominence for so fearlessly distancing himself, and by association much of his Muslim community, from terror and atrocity.

People gathered around candles and pens at the Place de la Republique in Paris in support of the victims after the terrorist attack on a French satirical cartoon magazine

So why, despite the example which Khan began setting as a teenager at the time of the London Underground bombing, does his voice remain so isolated in the world of sport in our supposedly United Kingdom?

As the threat moves ever closer to these shores with French cartoonists, journalists, police and democracy itself being gunned down by fanatical jihadists, what do we hear from Khan’s fellow athletes?

Silence. Even from his Muslim brothers in sport.

Scour their Twitter handles and what do you find about this assault on our way of life from Mo Farah, the Somali-born runner who was decorated by the Queen for winning a couple of gold medals at the London Olympics, or Moeen Ali - the cricketer who, like Khan, is of Pakistani extract but who took to the field for England wearing pro-Palestinian wrist-bands.

Boxer Khan has positioned himself as a brilliant role model and has spoken out against extremism

Devout Muslim Mo Farah has kept quiet since the shootings in Paris on Wednesday

Nothing that I can find.

Nothing about horror in Paris.

Nothing about children being massacred in Pakistan, Mr Moeen?

Nothing about schoolgirls being abducted and violated in Africa, Mr Farah?

Nothing to help Khan raise the standard for British tolerance and understanding to the level of that set by these giants of world sport:

Muhammad Ali, The Greatest: ‘It saddens me that human beings are suffering and dying at the hands of violent extremists. I send my deepest condolences to their families. Islam does not support terrorism.’

Imran Khan, master cricketer now Pakistani presidential candidate: ‘We must unite against such inhumanity to rid our world of terrorism.’

Cricket Moeen Ali, who wore a wristband showing support for Gaza last summer, has also remained silent

One of the terrorists fires at the officer at point-blank range - 12 people were killed in Paris on Wednesday

Not that Messers Farah and Moeen are alone in failing to add their voices to the hundreds of thousands exorcising the right to freedom of expression, for which ten of the staff of the satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo and two members of the gendarmerie sacrificed their lives, by proclaiming in French: ‘Je Suis Charlie.’

Where is the condemnation of these monstrous acts from Wayne Rooney, Lewis Hamilton, Rory McIlroy, even from Andy Murray who revealed a modicum of political awareness with his stance on Scottish independence?

Do they really not comprehend their power to exert influence for good? Do they not accept that fame and fortune brings responsibility?

But then what more might we expect from those who exist in such a privileged bubble that they have nothing to say about whether a convicted but still unrepentant rapist should be allowed to return to life as a role model for football-worshipping youngsters?

Comfortable with it or not, there is a parallel to be drawn between carnage in Paris and denial in Oldham. It is to be found in the moral quagmire into which our society is sinking.

While governments more feeble than Amir Khan wrestle with both their conscience and their fearful dilemma with Islam - good and evil - the queue of advocates for Ched Evans is lengthening.

‘He’s paid for his crime,’ they cry. ‘It’s time to give him a second chance.’

In charitable work, an office, on the buses maybe - but not in football it isn’t.

Not when the supporters of this despicable man - at his behest or nor - have so vilely persecuted his victim on social media for so long, hounding her from one false identity to another.

Not when his apology for ‘the effects of that night’ is so cravenly qualified by a failure to admit his crime and is so belatedly offered only after his rejection by another football club that it is virtually worthless.

Not as the father of his sadly misguided girlfriend funds a legal campaign for a man so wretchedly lacking in remorse that it is hard to see how any father would want his daughter anywhere near Evans, least of all in his bed.

Evans was released from prison in October, with his potential return to football sparking widespread debate

This has been not just character assassination. This has been terrorism of a deeply disturbing, personal order.

It is not the Twitter merchants who have been preventing this unpleasant specimen from returning to employment as a footballer. It is his thuggish reluctance to admit to his own wrong-doing.

Just as it was not those French cartoonists who provoked the killing of themselves with their lampooning of the Prophet Muhammad, as the political equivalents of the Evans apologists would tell us. It was the radicalisation of young Muslims into ranting, raving, maniacs.

Should sport join in the taking-of-a-stand against extremist atrocities?

Indeed it should, as a daily sports paper in France so poignantly demonstrated.

L’Equipe’s front page on the morning after the Paris slaughter was filled by this huge score-line: LIBERTE 0, BARBARITE 12.

So just to be clear: I Am Not Ched.

Je Suis Charlie.
