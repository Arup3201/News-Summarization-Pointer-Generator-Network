Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao equalised Colombia's international goals record with a 74th-minute penalty in his country's 3-1 away win over Kuwait in a friendly on Monday.

Falcao may have struggled for goals and form on the domestic stage this season, but the 29-year-old certainly hasn't had any trouble impressing on the international stage.

His penalty was his third international goal in two games and takes his tally to 24 goals in 56 matches, level with Colombian legend Arnoldo Iguaran.

Iguaran's record has survived untouched for 24-years, but Falcao looks set to overtake the former Millonarios striker, who bagged his 24 goals in 68 matches.

Falcao, quoted by the Colombian daily El Tiempo, suggested the record was not on his mind when he took the penalty after being brought down on the edge of the box.

'The fact is you're concentrating on taking (the penalty) and thank God I was able to score,' said Falcao, who has struggled to hold down a first team place at Manchester United this season.
