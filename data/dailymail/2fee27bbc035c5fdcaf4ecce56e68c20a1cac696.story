A professional gang of drug dealers who flooded the streets with heroin and crack cocaine has been jailed for a total of 177 years today.

The well-organised drugs network, made up of 22 people, dealt on an industrial scale before their operation was uncovered by a tip off from a member of the public.

Teesside Crown Court heard the ring made more than 100 trips between the north east and Manchester, delivering vast amounts of Class A drugs and money.

Industrial scale: Ringer leader Robert Hickman, 29, was jailed for 16 years for his part in the industrial scale drug-dealing operation. Scott Pickering, 28, played a similar role to Hickman and was sentenced to 15 years

Ben Crombie, 31, a 'leading character' was jailed for 14 years

Jamie Knox, 25, was jailed for nine years and four months

Jason Turnbull, 32, was jailed for 10 years and five months

Officers seized almost 6.9kg of heroin, 2.26kg of cocaine, 437.5g of crack cocaine and more than 22kg chemicals used to 'cut' the drugs.

The recovered narcotics were worth a total of £824,686 and were found alongside £127,966 cash.

But prosecutor Nick Dry said these amounts were just the 'tip of the iceberg'.

The plot between January 2012 and March 2013 was uncovered by Operation Cobweb, Cleveland Police's biggest ever drugs operation.

Judge Simon Bourne-Arton QC, the Recorder of Middlesbrough, said: 'It was carried out in a determined and ruthless fashion. It was conceived and put into effect by professional and experienced criminals who were aiming to achieve a high financial reward.

'And it was a conspiracy which succeeded in bringing over and distributing drugs on a large scale throughout this area.'

Martin Dougan, 32, was jailed for nine years and two months

David Hobson, 30, was jailed for eigh years and eight months

Junaid Mahmood, 29, was jailed for eight years and eight months

He said the drugs in the conspiracy 'exceeded well into the tens of kilogrammes'.

The longest prison sentence was given to 29-year-old Robert Hickman- the leader of the Teesside operation - who was jailed for 16 years.

The judge told him: 'You were at the heart of the this conspiracy in the Teesside area. Very little happened in the Teesside area in respect of this conspiracy that you were not aware of.'

He said Hickman had 'loyal lieutenants', directed couriers and was in contact with local drug distribution 'cells' using 20 mobile phones.

Police found a heat-sealing device, a money-counting machine and large sums of cash when they searched his home.

Hickman branded his sentence a 'joke' in a foul-mouthed outburst as he was led from the dock yesterday.

Scott Hine, 31, was jailed for eight years

Stephen Sparrow, 28, was jailed for eight years and eight months

Ricky Beresford, 24, was jailed for six years and eight months

The judge said Scott Pickering aka Scott McGowan, 28, was a 'hardened criminal' playing a similar role, jailing him for 15 years.

Ben Crombie, 31, who was jailed for 14 year, was described as a 'leading character' who directed the conspiracy and recruited others, distancing himself from the drugs.

Crombie was able to buy expensive homes, cars and private education from the plot.

He received a lighter sentence than Hickman and Pickering because, unlike them, he pleaded guilty.

His 'right hand man' James Kelly, 29, from Oldham, who controlled and managed couriers, was jailed for 10 years and eight months.

Former Army infantryman Jamie Knox, 25, from Oldham, a warehouseman who stored and bagged drugs, was jailed for nine years and four months.

A series of dealers who operated in Teessside were also sentenced.

Jason Turnbull, 32, who had met Crombie in prison, was jailed for 10 years and five months and Martin Dougan, 32, from Middlesbrough, was jailed for nine years and two months.

Danny Wilks, 24, was arrested with half a kilo of heroin after a £20,000 cash drop, was jailed for seven years and four months

Former Royal Artilleryman Mark Watson, 27, was jailed for four years and four months

David Wrigley, 32, was jailed for seven years

David Hobson, 30, of Stockton - said to have been a talented footballer at Hartlepool United - and Junaid Mahmood, 29, from Stockton, both had a drug dealing 'cell'.

Each were jailed for eight years and eight months. Scott Hine, 31,Middlesbrough, a 'persistent' dealer with his own team, was jailed for eight years.

'Determined and persistent drug dealer' Stephen Sparrow, 28, of Black was jailed for six years and eight months.

Hickman's 'right hand man' Ricky Beresford, 24, was jailed for six years and four months. The judge said he was of low intelligence and easily influenced.

Danny Wilks, 24, was arrested with half a kilo of heroin after a £20,000 cash drop and was jailed for seven years and four months. David Cuthbert, 38, was given a five-year sentence.

Former Royal Artilleryman Mark Watson, 27, and engineer Paul Gill, 36, of Stockton, were each jailed for four years and four months.

Paul Gill, 36, was jailed for four years and four months

Mark Powell, 36, was jailed for three years and three years and 12 weeks

Marl Dutton, 59, was jailed for six years and eight months

Mark Powell, 36, who collected drugs on one day, was jailed for three years and 12 weeks.

Painter and decorator David Wrigley, 32, from Failsworth, Greater Manchester, made 13 trips to Teesside in 16 days to deliver drugs and collect cash.

When he was arrested, police found £52,600 cash on him and he was jailed for seven years.

Mark Dutton, 59, from Rochdale, and Stephen Mayall, 30, from Royton, Oldham, who both made more than 20 trips, were each jailed for six years and eight months.

Personal trainer Ben Graham, 25, of Oldham, who made 12 trips, was jailed for six years.

His partner Hannah Hesketh, of Ashton-under-Lyne, who drove him to Teesside, was jailed for three-and-a-half years for her 'lesser role'.

All pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply Class A drugs except Hickman,Pickering and Hesketh who denied taking part in the plot and were convicted in March.

Several of the men - Sparrow, Beresford, Hobson and Dougan - had previous convictions for drug trafficking.

Wilks, Graham, Knox, Dutton, Mahmood, Hesketh and Gill had no previous convictions.

Defence barristers variously stressed factors like remorse, shame, references, personal difficulties, families, tragedies, trauma, illness,limited roles, vulnerability, work, drug addictions, debt, financial hardship and efforts to better themselves.

Crombie wrote a letter to the judge saying he'd met victims of drug abuse in prison. He wrote: 'Without my actions some of these people would never have resorted to crime.

'For that I would like to apologise to each and every one of them.

'I'm embarrassed and ashamed to tell you that I had it all and I threw it all away by my stupid and foolish selfish actions.'

Five other men were previously sentenced for connected drug offences.

Judge Bourne-Arton commended the police for a skillful, professional and determined investigation.
