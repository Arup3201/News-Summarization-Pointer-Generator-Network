An enthusiastic amateur photographer said he has spent many restless nights and early hours of the mornings - all rugged up with a camera ready on a tripod to do what he loves most - capturing the perfect moments in Canberra ACT.

John Hunt said the best times for taking great photographs is early in the morning when everyone is asleep to catch that perfect sunrise.

The 57-year-old said his favourite place to shoot his camera is around Lake Burley Griffin, either from land or in his kayak.

‘I love the lake when it's early in the morning because the water is still and there’s no wind,' he said.

‘I’ve managed to capture the beautiful mirrored reflection of the lake a few times and it’s been worth getting up early for.

'There are a few monuments around Canberra and I think the most photogenic feature is the Carillon, especially when it is lit up at night.

'I also love taking pictures at night, especially during winter time when it’s dark around 6pm and I’m walking home from work.’

Mr Hunt, who lives in Canberra, purchased his first DSLR camera before he went on a family trip to Europe and China in 2008 but admitted he had no clue how to use it.

It was two years ago when he took a professional photography course and not long after, found his love and passion for photography.

'I have been developing my photography skills over the last two and a half years and finally printed one of my own photos to hang on our loungeroom wall,' he said.

'I am really happy with this image of my hometown Canberra and it was taken early this month at the Lake Burley Griffin on a cold gloomy afternoon.

'All rugged up, camera on a tripod, I stood and waited for the perfect moment when the sun radiated it's brilliant red on the clouds.'

Mr Hunt said the camera can't always catch what his eyes see in reality so he goes through some editing process.

'For instance, when I take a picture in the sun, it might either be too dark from the shadow or too bright, so I edit the photos to allow others see what I see.

'People say it's cheating but I think it's not. I'm editing my photos the way I want the world to see through my eyes.'

When asked what his other styles of photography interests him, Mr Hunt said he is currently learning portrait photography, as well as taking photographs of family events.

‘My son got married in May this year and I took my camera to his wedding to take some photographs and everyone told me I did a good job.'

Mr Hunt said he will be going on a holiday with his wife Joanne to South Island, New Zealand at the end of September.

'I'm really excited about it and I cannot want to take my camera over there to take beautiful pictures of where we'll be staying,' he said.

Despite all his beautiful photography work, Mr Hunt owned a plumbing business for 25 years and he's onto his 40th year as a plumber. He also teaches plumbing at the Canberra Institute of Technology.

Mr Hunt lives in Canberra with his wife Joanne and they have two sons - Tom, 30 and Steven 28.

'Canberra is a big country town and I think it's a great place to raise children,' he said.

In June 2014, Canberra was voted as Australia's most 'liveable city'. It scored 10-out-of-10 for Safety, Income and Civic Engagement. Canberra's total score was 77.7 out of a possible 80.
