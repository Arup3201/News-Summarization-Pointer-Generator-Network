Wearing a huge doorknocker through your nose may not be the epitome of high fashion for most of us, but this catwalk trend is now hitting the High Street.

The look was first seen in Givenchy’s autumn/winter 2013  fashion show in Paris, when designer Ricardo Tisci sent both male and female models down the runway with intricately embellished, oversized nose rings.

Unsurprisingly, pieces by the high-end French designer do not come cheap: a 
single pale gold hoop nose ring with wing and jet crystal detail was on 
sale for $595 (£388) at Barneys department store.

However, you can now get the couture look at a fraction of the price as High Street brand ASOS.com has come up with a lookalike ‘spike’ nose ring - for just £5.

Punk look: The Asos doorknocker septum ring costs just £5 - and doesn't require you to have your nose pierced

Not born that way: Lady Gaga had her septum pierced while in Chicago this week. She's pictured here with the man who punched the hole

The clip-on hoop is made from stainless steel and features 
faceted stones either side of the central spike to give a touch of 
sparkle. It's designed to hang down over the lip, like the Givenchy jewellery.

Happily for the squeamish but fashion-conscious, neither the 
Givenchy and Asos versions require a piercing. However, the trend for puncturing the septum appears to be gathering steam.

Last week, Lady Gaga posted a video of herself having a hole punched between her nostrils, while Scarlett Johansson had hers done way back in 2006.

At this year's punk-themed Costume Institute Gala, Jessica Biel and Karen Elson both wore delicate  septum hoops.

The
 glamorously Gothic look which so impressed on the Givenchy catwalk was 
inspired by the meatpacking industry and iconic biker looks.

The
 striking nose jewellery was paired with oversized stud earrings by 
the male models, while the women showcased elaborate, chandelier-style earrings, which reached below their shoulders.

But wearing a septum ring can mean more than a simple fashion statement. The nasal piercing is traditionally 
associated with South Asian countries, such as India, Pakistan, Nepal. 
Bengali women traditionally wear the 'nathori' piercing as a sign
 of being a married woman.

The
 area pierced - the small gap between the dividing wall 
between the nostril and the bottom of the nose - is full of nerve 
endings, so the process can be extremely painful.

A septum piercing also takes between a month and three months to heal and needs to be carefully cleaned to prevent infection.

Ouch. Think we might stick to clip-ons for the time being...
