When Didier
 Drogba came off the bench, in the 62nd minute, the Ivory Coast were a 
goal down to Japan, and struggling to make an impression.

In the hour leading up to his introduction, the Elephants had managed just two shots on target, both from outside the box.

Within
 six minutes of his arrival, Drogba's side, inspired by the man who has 
led the line for them for so many years, had overturned the deficit and 
led 2-1.

The
 Ivory Coast striker was not directly involved in either goal, but his 
presence was enough both to worry the Japanese defence and breathe new 
confidence into his team-mates.

Faced
 with a twin threat, the Japan centre-backs were far less assured. 
Before Drogba came on they had just allowed one succesful cross into the
 box in over an hour. With the former Chelsea man on the pitch the Ivory
 Coast completed 4 crosses, two of which resulted in goals.

Drogba was not fully fit, which is why he didn't start in against 
Japan, but he could be set for a long-term role coming off the bench.

He
 and Wilfried Bony, scorer of the Ivorian equalizer, struggle to play 
together - in the sixteen minutes where they were both on the pitch Bony
 touched the ball just five times.

And manager Sabri Lamouchi suggested that the older man could be used as an impact substitute.Â

'Part of leaving him on the bench was to do with strategy, part of it was his fitness,' Lamouchi said.

'The last time he played 90 minutes was a few months ago in Turkey and he's had an injury since then.'

'When Didier Drogba came on the pitch everything changed,' Frenchman Lamouchi told reporters.

'When you have this calibre of player on the pitch you are very lucky.

'Of course, he was frustrated to be on the bench but if you saw the joy when he finished the match... he is a champion.'

The striker himself expressed his disappointment at being left out, but said he is motivated in any role for his country.

'I was disappointed (not to start),' the 36-year-old Drogba said to French newspaper L'Equipe. 'But I have to show my respect to those that started.

'When I 
went in, I just wanted to help the team to win the match and I did not 
need this disappointment in order to be motivated.

'I don't know how long I played but I knew it was important to give something extra to the team.

'Japan weren't very dangerous but we trailed and had to come from behind to win.

'It
 is a beautiful victory and we are happy with the result,' the 
Galatasaray forward said. 'We've prepared for many weeks for this game 
and it was important to start the competition on the right foot.

'This result will be very important especially if we play a good game against Colombia.'
