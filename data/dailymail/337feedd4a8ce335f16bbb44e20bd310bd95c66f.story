The ex-girlfriend of a British millionaire gold dealer is being sought by police after he was murdered at his Spanish villa.

Company director Andrew Bush, 48, was shot twice in the head, apparently as he arrived at the beach-side holiday home with his new British girlfriend.

Spanish police are seeking a blonde Eastern European in her twenties, believed to be his former lover.

'Crazed and jealous': Mr Bush was in a two-year relationship with lingerie and swimwear model Miss Kukucova (pictured), who is half his age, until he ended it in October. She is said to have taken the break-up badly

Search: Last night, as the net was closing in on Miss Kukucova after police found Mr Bush's 4x4 Hummer she is accused of fleeing in, videos and messages she had sent to her former boyfriend emerged

Obsessive? Photographs and videos of the couple together, captioned with words of affection and apology, show how intensive and perhaps obsessive, Miss Kukucova's feelings for the businessman were

Mr Bush, from Bristol, is understood to have been shot as he and his British girlfriend returned to the villa on the Costa del Sol from a holiday together. The killer is believed to have fled the scene in his Hummer truck.

Sources close to the investigation say police are considering whether his former partner – who is from Slovakia – was at the property near Estepona when Mr  Bush was shot.

They believe the killer had been waiting, possibly for days, for the couple to return. A source said: ‘It is being treated as murder and police are hunting the dead man’s ex.’

Mr Bush, who owns a chain of jewellery shops, had a home in South Wales but spent much of his time at the rented five-bedroom villa at Cancelada, between Estepona and San Pedro de Alcantara.

Yesterday, police took luxury cars – including a Porsche and Ferrari – from the property. An Audi believed to have been used by the killer was also taken away.

Mr Bush’s British girlfriend, who has not been named but is thought to be in her twenties, is said to have told investigators that his ex-lover opened the door as they returned from a week away at around 2am on Saturday.

She called police after being barred entry and seeing the woman speed off in Mr Bush’s Hummer. She did not have keys to get in.

Police and fire officers climbed into the building and found Mr Bush’s body lying in a pool of blood next to a gun.

The ex-girlfriend’s identity is not known but the source said she was Slovakian.

Several photographs on Facebook show Mr Bush embracing a blonde model, Mayka Marica Kukucova, who is Slovakian and who is believed to be an ex-girlfriend.

The neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: ‘She and Andrew moved in to the villa together nearly two years ago.

The English girlfriend only appeared recently on the scene. Andrew was away and the Spanish owner let himself into the garden a week before Saturday’s shooting to show the gardener something to do with the swimming pool.

‘He has told police all the curtains were drawn, which he found strange because whenever Mr Bush was away – and he was away often – he never drew the curtains.’

Miss Kukucova’s Facebook page shows photos of her posing in swimwear and lingerie, as well as less revealing outfits. One photoshoot, in her underwear, appears to have been for the fashion chain H&M.

She says she was a student at a Bristol language school.

One of the businesses owned by Mr Bush
 was Andrew Davids jewellers in Bristol. Its city centre branch in The 
Galleries was closed yesterday but a woman who runs a business opposite 
said: ‘I used to see him around. He was a really nice guy – I can’t 
believe what has happened.’

Another neighbour in Cancelada said that Mr Bush was a quiet man who kept himself to himself.

‘He
 wasn’t around all the time. I’ve heard he had business interests all 
over the world although I wasn’t sure exactly what he did.

Hiding: Mr Bush's allegedly killer may have been laying in wait for several days after letting herself into the villa

An Audi car believed to have been used by the alleged killer was taken away along with a Porsche and Ferrari thought to be owned by the dead man and a gun found by his side

The
 only woman I ever saw at the property was a pretty young blonde woman 
who was British like him. She was his current girlfriend. She must have 
been in her mid to late twenties. He kept a boat in the grounds and he 
always drove nice cars.’

A
 Spanish emergency services spokesman said: ‘We received a call at 
2.10am on Saturday from the partner of the dead man because she could 
not gain access to the property.

Firefighters managed to get in and found the man lying dead inside with a gunshot wound to his head. Police are investigating.’

Mr
 Bush had a five-bedroom, £500,000 property in Chepstow, South Wales, 
with metal shutters on the windows and reinforced gates. A neighbour 
said an armed robbery took place there last year, when an Eastern 
European housemaid was tied up.

A
 Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We are aware of the death of a British 
national in Estepona. We are in touch with local authorities and stand 
ready to offer consular assistance to the family.’
