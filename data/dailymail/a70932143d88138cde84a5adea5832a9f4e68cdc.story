Many firms have been accused of deliberately leaking details to generate interest in upcoming products, and the latest Amazon 'holophone' rumours appear to have done just that.

A day after the firm announced it would be unveiling a new product later this month, stock in the Seattle-based company rose by more than 5.4 per cent to $323.57 (£192).

It has since risen further to $328 (£194) - although is still a way off the firm's January high of $407 (£241).

Amazon's much rumoured holophone is set to be announced on June 18. The retailer released a teaser video on Wednesday, showing people's reaction to the device. Previously images of the handset have leaked online. The latest images (pictured) reveal a relatively thin handset - that looks a lot like Apple's iPhone

The device has a front facing camera in each corner of the screen.

These extra cameras are used to track the position of the user’s face and eyes in relation to the phone’s display.

This allows Amazon’s software to make constant adjustments to the positioning of on-screen elements.

It can also alter the perspective of visuals on the screen and make them appear to be in 3D - without the need for glasses.

As a result of the speculation, this increase also caused
 chief executive Jeff Bezos' net worth to rise by $1.4billion, 
according to reports by Forbes.

However, at $29.9 billion, this amount is still a way off the $36 billion Bezos was worth in January when stocks were at a high.

Amazon's much-rumoured holophone is set to be announced by Bezos on June 18, the shopping giant has confirmed.

The retailer released a teaser video on Wednesday, showing people's reaction to the phone.

It is believed the
 device will use retina-tracking technology to make images on the 
smartphone's display appear to 'float above the screen like a hologram 
and appear three-dimensional at all angles.'

Images of the handset have previously leaked online. In the latest set of these images, the handset looks relatively thin - similar to the Apple's iPhone.

'Multiple trusted sources have verified the authenticity of the image, which was created for internal use by graphic designers at Amazon,' website BGR said.

The handset appears to take design cues from Apple's iPhone 5 and Google's Nexus handset.

It is believed to have a 4.7-inch display with 720p HD resolution, a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, 2GB of RAM, and six individual camera modules to make the 3D effect work.

It will run a highly customised version of Google’s Android operating system similar to the one seen on Amazon’s Kindle Fire tablets.

The handset will be revealed in June and launched in September, reports claim.

This would pit it directly against Apple's upcoming iPhone 6, which is also expected to go on sale in September.
