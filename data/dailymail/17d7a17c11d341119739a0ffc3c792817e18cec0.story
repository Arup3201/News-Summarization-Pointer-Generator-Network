Jack Wilshere got a little carried away as Arsenal were parading the FA Cup trophy around London on Sunday.

The midfielder, who came on during extra-time in the 3-2 win against Hull City, swore while addressing supporters from above.

Wilshere grasped on to the mic in order to have his moment.

You're not taking this off me! The midfielder loved the limelight straight after the final whistle against Hull

'What do we think of Tottenham?' he shrieked. 'S***' was the reply from the adoring fans below.

'What do we think of s***?' Wilshere replied. 'Tottenham!' they said.

Sky Sports News aired the chant and were forced to offer a swift apology.

Wilshere can't be blamed for his over exuberance, given how long he's waited to get his hands on silverware in a red shirt.

The Gunners ended a nine-year trophy drought against the Tigers thanks to goals from Santi Cazorla, Laurent Koscielny and the eventual Aaron Ramsey winner.

Per Mertesacker also took hold of the mic, belting out a rendition of 'Arsenal 'till I die'.

Leading from the front: Wilshere lapped up the applause at the head of the bus with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain

Thanks to our fans: Thousands of supporters flocked to Highbury & Islington for the celebration
