Sir Elton John is undoubtedly Watford's most famous supporter, and his contributions to the club as a fan and owner were recognised before the club played Wigan  on Saturday.

The musician, who is life president, is at Vicarage Road not only to see his beloved Hornets in action in the Championship, but also for the unveiling of 'The Sir Elton John stand'.

John has been owner of the club on two occasions from 1976-87 and 1997-2002.
