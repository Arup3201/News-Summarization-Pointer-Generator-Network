A father has been arrested for allegedly murdering his nine-year-old son with a hatchet as the boy slept on the couch.

Matthew Raymond Hernandez was brutally slayed as his great-grandmother looked on and pleaded with his father, 36-year-old Phillip Raymond Hernandez, to stop, police said.

The horrific killing at the family's home in South Natomas, California on Tuesday night came as Hernandez battled his ex-wife to keep custody of their two sons.

The couple's other son, who is 12, was at the home at the time of the attack but was not harmed.

Hernandez went into the backyard on Tuesday night and fetched a hatchet, police said. He then smashed through a sliding glass door to get back inside the home, but police do not know why.

The boy's great-grandmother heard the glass shatter and ran to the living room, where she saw Hernandez standing over his sleeping son, armed with the hatchet, police said.

She tried to stop him from hurting the boy, but Hernandez allegedly threw her to the side and began attacking the boy with the hatchet as the woman looked on, Police Officer Michele Gigante said.

Police received two hysterical 911 calls from the female relative as Hernandez left the scene.

Officers arrived to find the boy dead and searched the neighbourhood for the man, theÂ Sacramento Bee reported. He was found walking a mile away and taken into custody.

Hernandez remains at the Sacramento County Main Jail and will be arraigned on Friday.

'Everybody is just trying to deal 
with losing a child and the father of a child, because basically we lost
them both,' a relative, Chris Duran, told CBS. 'There is no way to 
explain something like this.'

Gigante said investigators are also deeply affected by what they found at the scene.

'I
can see how horrific the scene must have been by how the detectives are
responding. As a parent, I couldn't even imagine it,' Gigante told the 
Bee. 'You don't want to envision it in your mind.'

The boys' mother, Jessica Hernandez, lives out of state but is travelling to be with her surviving son.

The courts had previously ordered that the boys live with her during their summer vacations, but stay with their father the rest of the year, the Bee reported.

Court records show Hernandez and his ex-wife, who married in January 2001 and separated in April 2004, had a turbulent relationship with each other and the courts.

In 2004, he was charged with domestic violence and pleaded no contest, and he was sentenced to 120 days in jail and five years of probation.

In November 2005, he was again charged with corporal injury on a spouse and sent to prison. He served time between July 2006 and October 2007 and finished parole in November 2008.

After his release, the Hernandez fought for custody of the boys, CBS Sacramento reported.

He wrote to the judge: 'It's been over three years since I last saw them. They are what matter, my view of life and what is important. I love them with all of my heart and I want to give what I didn't have - a father.'

But in 2012, their mother launched another fight to win full custody of the boys.

'He was going through rough times and so 
we don't know what triggered, but obviously something did and it's a 
tragedy we all have to deal with,' Duran said.
