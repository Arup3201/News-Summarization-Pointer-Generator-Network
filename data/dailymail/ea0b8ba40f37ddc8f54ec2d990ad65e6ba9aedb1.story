Parents will be able to take their children out of school during term time for special occasions in a relaxation of the holiday ban introduced by Michael Gove.

After a string of controversial cases, the new guidelines drawn up by head teachers' leaders make clear when families can take children away from classes.

The rules have been backed by new Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, and will allow children to attend family weddings or funerals, recover after a personal or family crisis, attend a religious event or visiting a relative who is seriously ill.

New Education Secretary Nicky Morgan is backing a relaxation of the rules drawn up by the National Association of Head Teachers

Under the new guidelines revealed in the Sunday Times, parents will still be prevented from taking advantage of cheap holiday breaks in term time. 

They were drawn up by the National Association of Head Teachers and have been backed by Ms Morgan, whose Mr Gove brought the changes in last year 

They ended the right for schools to grant up to 10 days holiday per year in special circumstances.

It left parents facing fines of £60 per pupil per parent if they took children out of school without permission and those who refused to pay were fined £2,500 by the courts and could even be jailed for up to three months.

The new rules were aimed at preventing youngsters missing vital chunks of their education, but became one of Gove's most unpopular policies. 

The move was criticised by campaigners who claimed it was unfair on parents and had no affect on the level of a child's academic achievement.

Liberal Democrat MP, John Hemming, is chairman of campaign group Parents Want a Say, which collected more than 200,000 signatures from parents who opposed the new rules.

He said: 'This is a very welcome U-turn. However the devil is in the detail. We will now be monitoring the situation and we may still press for some families to be allowed to take cheap term-time holidays.' 

Previously, he told MailOnline: 'The government's own research says that a small amount of authorised holidays has no negative affect on achievement and may in fact result in better outcomes.

'The time that parents have to concentrate on their children means that if they do ensure that work is put into academic issues then it can be better for the children. 

'There are many cases where families are badly impacted by the new rules. Families should be supported by the government rather than family life made more difficult.'

Since the changes were brought in, more than 60,000 families have been fined by councils for taking children out of school without approval.

Dozens of parents have been convicted by magistrates' courts after refusing to pay penalty charges of £60 per child, rising to £120 if not paid within 21 days.

In one of the most high profile cases, Kerry Capper, 25, was ordered to pay a £120 penalty fine for keeping her daughter off school for seven days.

Miss Capper said she let her daughter have the odd day off to 'keep an eye on her' as she was recovering from cancer.

In 2010, her daughter Libby Bennett had been diagnosed with a tumour in one of her kidneys, but recovered after several months of chemotherapy.

The cancer has not come back but Libby remains under the care of Birmingham Children's Hospital for regular check-ups.

Between January and March this year Miss Capper kept Libby at home for a total of seven days when she felt unwell, instead of sending her to Paget Primary School, in Pype Hayes, Birmingham.

She was ordered to pay the fine, but cleared of a criminal act.

In another case taken up by the campaign group, a five-year-old was refused permission to go with her parents on the family's first holiday abroad.

Pauline and Craig Stephenson from Cramlington, Northumberland, asked Northburn Primary School for leave to take their daughter Lauren to France for a week in September.

Because of his work commitments as a police officer, Mr Stephenson was not able to take time off during the six-week holidays. The school refused but the family still went.

In a separate case, James and Dana Haymore, from Chelmsford, refused to pay Essex County Council a £120 fine for taking their three children to the US to attend a family memorial service.

He refused to pay a £120 fine from his local council and was expected to appear in court where he faced a £2,500 fine and a jail term.

But the council said it was no longer in the public interest to pursue the case as the family left to live in the US.

Elsewhere, 41-year-old salesman Jason Short left his job, so he could take his family away during the school holidays.

Plymouth City Council fined Mr Short £120 for taking seven-year-old Madeleine on holiday to Turkey in June, during the only time he was allowed to take off work.

He claims he had explained the situation to teachers at Salisbury Road Primary School in Plymouth and was told not to worry but was later hit with the fine.

But he returned home after the break to find he had a letter from the council stating he would be fined for taking Madeleine out of school without permission. 

In response to the new rules, a DfE spokesperson said: 'The NAHT is clear that they firmly support the current policy and term-time holidays should only be granted in exceptional circumstance. 

'There are no plans at all to change the policy and no u-turn. Headteachers have always been able to decide what exceptional circumstances are, but if they find that the NAHT's guidance assists them in making this judgement then we welcome that.'
