Are sugar daddies becoming 'Splenda daddies'?

According to SeekingArrangment.com, a site that pairs wealthy older men with younger women,  the average sugar daddy salary dropped from $321,482 to $273,301 between 2007 and 2013. 

The site surveyed the number of users in major 
metropolitan areas to find the top 20 sugar daddy cities. Atlanta, with 5.98 per 1,000 men, unseated San Francisco to become the sugar daddy capital of America.

Scottsdale, Arizona came in second place, followed by San
 Francisco. Seeking Arrangement Founder and CEO Brandon Wade claims that the demographic of sugar daddies is changing. They are getting younger - 39 is the average age now compared to 44 in 2007 - and there are more single men using the site than ever before.

'Since 2007, the number of married sugar daddies has dropped from 46per cent to 33per cent, a sign that the sugar 
lifestyle is becoming more widely accepted amongst single men,' he said in a press release.

'The 
average American Sugar Daddy is now 39 years old, makes $275,301 
annually and spends approximately $5100 per month on his sugar baby.'

Career choice: Professionals and entrepreneurs are common occupations for sugar daddies, with finance being the third most common

According to the site, there is a high concentration of sugar babies in the South: Georgia State University reported the most sugar babies in the survey, while New York University came in second and University of Georgia ranked 8th. Many college-town based sugar babies use their 'allowance' to pay rent, bills and credit card debt.

But lower density can translate to higher hauls: Sugar daddies in Miami are the most generous: Sugar babies there rake in an average $6166m per month, above New York at $5692 and Scottsdale at $4683. Sugar daddies in San Francisco and Atlanta don't even make the top 10.

It's clear that the line between hooking up and just plain hooking is becoming increasingly blurred. Sugar babies aren't paid directly for sex. Their compensation comes in the form of Christian Louboutin shoes, designers clothes and trips to Europe. One 19-year-old sugar baby recently told the Daily News that the situation with her 45-year-old lover is 'not prostitution, it's more for companionship' because they 'transition' into sex.

Wade has said that a sugar baby relationship is ideal for men who don't have time to date the traditional way - and proponents insist that it's legal and no one is getting hurt.

But therapists report that some women involved in these types of arrangements report a similar he emotional impact to those who participate in prostitution - shame, vulnerability, anxiety, and depression.

The Seeking Arrangement site prefers to focus on the men's problems, including the economy: For women whose dates are having financial problems, the blog advises women who date a guy with financial problems that 'if you have established a relationship with this Sugar Daddy, then don’t be quick to dismiss him as Splenda.'

Or they could just move to Miami.
