Thousands of workers suffering from arthritis are being forced into early retirement because of their condition, say poll findings

Thousands of workers suffering from arthritis are being forced into early retirement because of their condition, say poll findings.

Up to half a million may have had to give up work in their 50s as growing pain and disability take their toll.

A survey found almost one in five of those still employed have had to change the way they work as a result, with one in 10 curbing their hours.

One in 10 osteoarthritis sufferers aged 55 and over say it has affected their work, with two thirds quitting.

Around eight million people have osteoarthritis, which affects the joints, particularly the knees.

Osteoarthritis researcher Professor Philip Conaghan, from the University of Leeds, said: ‘One of the key issues that this survey highlights is the massive negative impact of osteoarthritis on people in work.

‘With a rapidly ageing population and financial imperatives for us to stay in the work force longer, the consequences will include much more personal anguish and even greater economic burden on society.

‘We need to understand the osteoarthritis treatment strategies that will maintain people in their jobs.’

In the poll of 700 sufferers aged 55 and over, one third had to give up a sport or hobby they really enjoyed.

One in 20 had to forego holidays and playing with the grandchildren because of their symptoms, says the survey by knee and lower back pain therapy company AposTherapy.

Ed Butler, UK clinical lead at AposTherapy, said: ‘As well as the individuals who suffer, there is also the greater impact on society as a whole to consider.

In 2008, there was an estimated cost of £10 billion on the economy due to people being forced into permanent retirement because of either osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.

‘It is worrying that such a high proportion of osteoarthritis sufferers are giving up careers they have most likely dedicated a significant amount of their life to.

‘Whilst osteoarthritis can be extremely painful, it does not mean sufferers have to put a stop to doing the things they love.’
