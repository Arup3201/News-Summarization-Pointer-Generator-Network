The body of a large man has been found in the boot of a burnt-out car on a quiet road on the outskirts of Melbourne. 

Firefighters and police were called to a blaze on the secluded Bulla-Diggers Rest Road just after midnight on Friday when motorists passing the burning car alerted authorities. 

The body was so badly burnt that police have not yet been able to identify it. 

But Victoria Police Homicide Squad Detective Senior Sergeant Stuart Bailey has told media he was a 'large man - we'd say he was 100kg plus.'

'We don't know what he has died of at this point in time, but he has been fully engulfed in fire so identity is an issue,' he told AAP. 

Firefighters made a 'grizzly' discovery of a body in the boot of this Peugeot after being called to the car fire outside of Melbourne early Friday morning

The body of the 'large' man was so badly burnt police are yet to identify him

'We're hoping we can use dental records to assist us in identifying the deceased, also DNA,' he told Nine News. 'There may be an opportunity for a (finger) print on one hand, but it is going to be difficult.'

'It would have been an extremely confronting and grizzly find for the CFA (Country Fire Authority) members who pulled that boot up early this morning,' said Det Sen Sgt Bailey.

Police believe the car, a late-model, possibly yellow Peugeot 407 wagon, was travelling in an easterly direction along Bulla-Diggers Rest Road and was rammed into a fence  before it stopped at Holden Bridge.

'That road takes you down under the Holden bridge where you'd be out of view, and I think that is where they've tried to get to, but the car was too badly damaged as a result of hitting the bollards,' said Det Sen Sgt Bailey.

Police removing the body from the boot of the burnt out car on Friday

The car had its number plates removed - suggesting it had been stolen - and its engine  number had partially melted in the blaze. The car was so badly burnt police believe an accelerant was used to set it alight.

Police are working with Peugeot and Vic Roads to determine the car's owner and are reviewing security camera footage from petrol stations on the nearby Calder Freeway for clues.

An autopsy is underway to determine the age and identity of the man and Victoria police are appealing to the public for information about the car.
