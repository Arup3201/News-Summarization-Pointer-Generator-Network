A photographer has captured candid and incredibly moving photographs of teenage triplets, all of whom suffer from autism.

Over the course of two years, José Antonio de Lamadrid, 50, from Seville, has followed three 18-year-old brothers who were all born with the same complex neurological disorder.

Mr Lamadrid wanted to follow Alejandro, Álvaro and Jaime Morillo  Aguilar because he was fascinated and touched by their interaction.

Mr Lamadrid also has personal experience of the condition as his nephew is autistic.

Here Jaime, Alejandro and Álvaro (left to right) are on their way to school in their parent's car. It took three years for them to be diagnosed with the complex neurological disorder

The condition is characterised by a 
difficulty to communicate and socialise yet the three men have a visibly
strong brotherly bond.

The men's parents, Noelia and Jaime, said that it was shortly after their sons turned one that they started to notice differences between them and children of the same age.

They said that the boys did not respond to their calls and seemed disinterested by things that should have fascinated the them - planes in the sky, barking dogs and offerings of sweets all went unnoticed.

Here the triplets' clothing is laid on the bed they sleep in during summer. They like to wear the same clothes as each other

Isolated: Alejandro is pictured in the school playground. The image captures how difficult it can be for autistic people to interact with their peers and the wider world

Every day, Jaime and Alejandro write their diary, documenting exactly what they have done, including minute details such as playing on their Nintendo console. Those with autism tend to be obsessive about their routine

This photograph captures the touching moment that father Jaime washes and shaves his son, Alejandro. Despite their age, the triplets will remain childlike and vulnerable for the rest of their life

It took three years and a raft of tests for them to be diagnosed. They were not deaf, there were not obvious genetic ot neurological problems.

'When you do not have any of these symptoms, you have autism,' Noelia said.

Álvaro suffers with the most severe learning difficulties out of the three because he suffered a brain injury in childhood. As a result he attends a specialised autism centre.

Alejandro and Álvaro may be 18-years-old but their condition makes them remarkably childlike. Here they are photographed playing cowboys at home

Alejandro is fixated by an image of himself in a mirror of a supermarket. Autism removes a person's understanding of what is acceptable in social situations

His brothers Alejandro and Jaime however attend the local high school that offers special classes to help them integrate with those unaffected by the condition.

As with many people suffering autism, the men are very keen to stick to a routine.

They
tirelessly document their days - even recording the minutiae of atching
TV, washing the dishes and, as one diary entry says, 'eating a coconut
yoghurt and playing Nintendo'.

Every
Friday the men go to the town library to rent out movies. They also 
visit their local leisure centre to socialise with other children who 
have autism.

Here Jaime enjoys being pampered by his mother and aunt in preparation for a costume party. The photographer's images give a rare insight into the complex world of men living with a condition that remains relatively misunderstood

Álvaro always carries small objects in his hands - everyday items that he calls 'inventions'. Autism is often characterised by obsessive tendencies, such as becoming fixated by seemingly unimportant objects

Here the brothers play, supervised by a social worker, while they wait to be picked up by their parents from their weekly club. Every Friday they play games and meet other people with autism at a local recreation centre

Alejandro
is an accomplished artist and enjoys playing puzzles.

Since the age of six 
he has been able to complete 1000-piece jigsaws in a matter of hours.

Álvaro,
always carries what he refers to as 'inventions'. Objects include clay
figures and everyday household objects such as combs, pegs,
scissors and pencils.

Jaime has a incredible memory - for example, if he is given a date he is able to tell you what day of the week it was, even if it was many years ago.

Álvaro does not like noise and here he covers his ears in the recreation centre he attends each Friday. There he interacts - by bowling, for example - with other autistic people

Alejandro is pictured completing a puzzle. Since the age of six he has been able to complete 1000-piece jigsaws within a matter of hours

Jaime is the most competent at interacting and speaking with other people and is the natural spokesperson of the three.

Despite their age, the men will always be childlike - both in terms of their interests and their understanding of the world around them.

Mother
Noelia said: 'I look forward to the age that they can realise their 
dreams. Maybe they can go to the Caribbean, or work in a  factory in 
their Murcia with their cousin, Laura.'

'Many autistic people have communication and language problems and they do not understand lies, sarcasm.

'We are not only a form family. We are a team.'

This photo shows a moment of intimacy between a mother and son. Noelia hugs Álvaro after he returns from his Friday night out at the recreation centre where he meets other people with autism

Everyday life: Here Álvaro, the most severely autistic of the three brothers, hides his face while Jaime and Alejandro hang up the washing

Loving family: Parents Noelia and Jaime look at an X-ray of the mouth of Álvaro on the bus home from the hospital. Because of their condition, the triplets rely entirely on their mother and father for their wellbeing

Lamadrid hopes his photographs will encourage greater support from the Spanish government and autism organisations for families like the Morillo Aguilars.

He said: 'Despite the condition, this family is very happy. Every day is quite hard for them, but they go to bed happy.

'It makes you put your life into perspective. What I once thought were big worries are nothing when confronted with the task the Morillo Aguilars have on their hands.'
