A middle-aged British mother-of-two has joined Islamic State extremists after running away to wage jihad with her toyboy husband.

Muslim convert Sally Jones, 45 –who has spent a lifetime on state benefits – ranted online about how she wants to behead Christians with a ‘blunt knife’.

The unemployed mother, who was once an aspiring rock musician, claims to have joined bloodthirsty jihadis roaming the lawless border between Syria and Iraq.

Chaotic lifestyle: Mother-of-two Sally Jones - who has spent a lifetime on state benefits - before she left Britain to marry a British hacker turned jihadi who she met online

A video posted on YouTube, and then deleted, is believed to show Sally Jones playing in a rock band in the early 1990s. It is thought Jones may have converted to Islam and travelled to Syria

On an account attributed to Umm Hussain al-Britani, this pictured was posted showing a female fighter holding an AK-47

She is believed to have abandoned her two 
young sons to marry one of the   British suspects in the beheading of  
US journalist James Foley.

Jones, who now calls herself Sakinah 
Hussain, wears traditional Islamic dress and has swapped her home in 
Chatham, Kent, for Raqqa, the Syrian stronghold of terror group IS.

Last
 night her brother Patrick, 52, who runs his own paving company, said 
his family are deeply shocked by her conversion to radical Islam.

Speaking at his £500,000 home in Oxted, Surrey, he said: ‘This is a very
 upsetting and distressing time for my family and I just don’t want them
 to be a part of it. She fell in love and went away.’

Jones is 
thought to have sneaked into Syria at the end of last year after an 
online romance with Junaid Hussain, 20. She has posted a series of 
chilling threats on social networking sites and posed for photos with an
 AK-47, while dressed in black with her face veiled.

Using the 
pseudonym Umm Hussain al-Britani, she has abused Jews and praised Osama 
bin Laden.

Just days ago, she warned: ‘You Christians all need beheading
 with a nice blunt knife and stuck on the railings at Raqqa...  Come 
here I’ll do it for you!’

Her husband Hussain is a computer hacker 
who fled Britain while on police bail suspected of violent disorder in 
Birmingham. He was jailed for six months in 2012 for stealing sensitive 
information from an aide of Tony Blair and blocking a government 
anti-terrorist hotline with prank calls.

Hussain travelled to the 
warzone with Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, 24, a former rapper dubbed the ‘hip
 hop jihadi’. Both men now fight for IS and are suspects in the killing 
of Mr Foley.

Jones is an unlikely Islamic convert and even more 
unlikely member of the terrorist militia. In the early 1990s she was the
 lead guitarist in an all-girl rock band called Krunch who played a 
series of gigs in the South East.

A clip of one of her performances 
posted online shows her with a shock of blonde hair and wearing a 
leather mini-skirt. In recent years she developed an interest in art, 
attempting to sell fantasy pictures as well as T-shirts, mugs and key 
rings through a niche website.

On August 10 Umm Hussain tweeted that her and her husband had made it to the 'Caliphate'

She has also posted up a series of warning, the most extreme of which have recently been removed

She adopted several online personas such as Skya and Catgel, and contributed to forums on  conspiracy theories, witchcraft and black magic.

One bizarre picture showed her dressed as a nun while pointing a large handgun.

She later forged an online romance with Hussain, who was the leader of a computer hacking group known as Team Poison. Using identities such as Pu55yTheGod and Pu55y Hussain, she posted dozens of messages denouncing rivals.

Speaking near Jones’s former two-bedroom council house in Chatham,  neighbour Julie Horton, 58, said yesterday: ‘She was very scatty, everything was always a drama. Her language wasn’t  good, her children were unruly and she was extremely loud. Men came and went but she lived mainly as a single mum with her two boys.’

Another neighbour added: ‘She was a nightmare. Always screaming and shouting and up all hours of the night. Everything about her was extreme. She had problems with debts so one minute she was there, the next she’d scarpered. She started to go through a phase of thinking she was a witch.

‘She’d post pictures on Facebook of her dressed in a cloak and said things about being able to talk to spirits.’

It is not known what has happened to her sons, aged around ten and 14, whom she described in photographs posted online in 2010 as the ‘loves of my life’.  After being contacted by journalists, Jones deleted messages, including the threat to behead Christians.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said yesterday: ‘We appeal to the public to help identify for us  aspiring terrorists.’
