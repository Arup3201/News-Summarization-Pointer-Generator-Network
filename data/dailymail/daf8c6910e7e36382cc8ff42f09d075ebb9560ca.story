He has a reputation for lateness, but Simon Cowell excelled himself when he turned up four hours behind schedule for filming on Britain’s Got Talent last week.

Sometimes there is an excuse for such shoddy behaviour. For example, he will plead he has had a migraine, as he did last month when he was five hours late.

At other times he will say, infuriatingly but truthfully, he was soaking in the bath while everyone was waiting for him.

On this occasion, apparently, he didn’t even offer an excuse.

As you might imagine, this habit infuriates his fellow judges and the army of producers and technicians who end up working until nearly midnight to accommodate his eccentric schedule.

But Cowell, once so insecure he needed a friend to help him walk past the bank of secretaries at the record company RCA, can suffer from curious black moods.

His fear of failure is well known — some 
friends such as the retail billionaire Sir Philip Green have confided 
that they almost nod off during his long introspective monologues about 
his career.

And, right now, there are lots of reasons for the so-called Dark Lord of popular culture to feel lacking in confidence. 

He has just seen the worst-ever ratings 
for the launch show of any TV programme that he has been behind — with 
the painfully derivative format of his latest primetime offering, Food 
Glorious Food.

Puffed out: Simon Cowell has been cruelly dubbed 'Pieman Cowell' in newspaper headlines after viewers noticed his face appeared puffy

It got a dismal 2.7 million viewers on its first outing on ITV, and 2.4 million on Wednesday night last week. That’s about half what you might expect in a plum slot after Coronation Street.

This was particularly galling for Cowell, as he was heavily involved in the concept and execution of the show. He said before it went out that he was ‘really nervous’, and conceded that success or failure in TV was ‘all about ratings in the end’.

The past 12 months have seen a succession of failures. Starting with an ‘unauthorised’ biography about him by respected author Tom Bower — with whom he co-operated — it has been an unhappy year.

His TV talent shows have started to look tired and lose audiences, his new ideas haven’t taken root, his judges keep on quitting, and he has fallen into a fractious relationship with the TV networks who are his paymasters.

On a personal level, he has struggled to get a grip with his weight or his addiction to cigarettes and remains, at 53, single and dependent on ex-girlfriends — some of them on his payroll — for company. One old friend told me: ‘His success has been unparalleled, but in the end he is a victim of it, because it’s fading away and he seems unable to do anything to stop it.’

There are worrying stories of Cowell, long known for his hypochondriac reliance on vitamins and smoothie health drinks, developing serious anxieties over germs. Apparently he throws away teaspoons if they have been used to eat yogurt for fear of bacteria, and has installed gel hand sanitiser units in his dressing room.

It’s all a little bit like the infamous American recluse Howard Hughes.

More seriously, some media analysts believe his annus horribilis may be the beginning of the end of what has been a promethean career.

Steve Hewlett, a former programmes 
boss at Carlton, summed up Cowell’s success to me, saying that he ‘was 
the right person in the right place at the right time . . . but that 
doesn’t mean that he has a tin of fairy dust and can do it again’.

So what has gone wrong?

Clash: Hiring Gary Barlow as an X Factor judge alongside Nicole Scherzinger, Tulisa Contostavlos and Louis Walsh was the decision of ITV and against Cowell's wishes

The publication of the Bower book, Sweet Revenge, seems to have been his first misstep. It featured some headline-grabbing revelations — such as his affair with X Factor judge Dannii Minogue and about him feeling manipulated by a flirtatious Cheryl Cole.

Yet Cowell was deeply embarrassed by the revelations and by the schoolboy-ish comments attributed to him when he lusted after Cole and his nights of passion with Minogue. In its immediate wake, there were clashes over the hiring of Gary Barlow as a judge for The X Factor, which was the decision of ITV and against Cowell’s wishes.

And his relationship with the network 
was soured further last May when Shu Greene, who had been his right-hand
woman since 2004, left his company Syco to work for ITV.

In
her new job, she devises and then puts on screen new entertainment 
formats for the network, meaning she is in direct competition with her 
old boss.

He was so rattled he rang ITV executive 
Denise O’Donoghue to remonstrate about them taking Ms Greene from him. A
few weeks after that call, Cowell was bedridden with what seems to have
been a near-breakdown. He took six weeks off work.

Blow: It is now said that ITV sees Ant and Dec as more important to the success of Britain's Got Talent

Cowell later confided to friends that the long-term pressure of running his empire on both sides of the Atlantic — the time difference is up to eight hours — had turned him into a ‘weird vampire’, answering texts and messages through the night.

Within days of returning to work — launching The X Factor USA — he was smoking constantly and working 20-hour days.

Nor has the American show been a success. Despite installing Britney Spears on the judging panel, it performed poorly, losing three  million viewers compared with the previous year. And viewers noticed something had happened to Cowell’s face. His cheeks were puffy and he seemed to have acquired a double chin.

The headlines were cruel. He was called ‘Pieman Cowell’, and one publication asked: ‘What’s happened to Simon Cowell’s face — and is it just for Hallowe’en?’

Cowell didn’t find it funny. The problem, according to a source in Los Angeles, was he had put on 15lb through comfort-eating, while continuing to have Botox injections and plumping face-fillers.

He has been seen in the Whole Foods health food store near his LA home spending more than 45 minutes studying vitamins and supplements. Each day he has three ‘super’ smoothies for breakfast (in search of eternal youth). The recipes have been devised by French scientists and ingredients include lingonberry, acerola berry and chokeberry.

Once a week, he has an intravenous drip that administers vitamin B12, vitamin C, magnesium, and, in his words, ‘something for your liver’. Last September, he also hired a personal trainer. But he detests training sessions and they haven’t had the desired result of helping him to shift the weight.

An old friend told me: ‘He is a real contradiction: he smokes and he can’t sleep, and he lives a completely workaholic bachelor lifestyle, which is very bad for him. But then he has every health fad going. He claims they balance each other out!’

The big question is: would he approach life in quite such an extreme manner if his television shows were all a roaring success?

The last series of The X Factor in the UK was the least watched since 2007 and the final had the worst rating in seven years. It was beaten consistently by Strictly Come Dancing on BBC1. Red Or Black, a gameshow with Ant and Dec aired last September, was also a massive and expensive flop.

Cowell has also fallen out with some of his star hirings. Gary Barlow,  Britney Spears and record producer LA Reid mutter they don’t want to continue, and Cowell has said he doesn’t want Tulisa Contostavlos  to return as an X Factor judge.

Falling out: There have been mutterings that star hiring Britney Spears does not want to continue on the US version of X-Factor. Cowell is said to be keen on hiring Lady Gaga and Katy Perry to replace her

He is trying to assemble two ‘dream team’ judging panels for The X Factor on both sides of the Atlantic. In America, he is keen to see Lady Gaga and Katy Perry behind the judges’ desk. In the UK, the new series may be presided over by Barlow, Sharon Osbourne, Louis Walsh and singer Rita Ora.

In a further blow to Cowell’s ego, it is now said ITV sees Ant and Dec as more important to the success of the UK show, and Cowell could face a pay cut when they renegotiate the terms of his production deal.

Steve Hewlett, now a media analyst, says: ‘What happened with The X Factor is that Simon Cowell had his moment. His personality, and his background in the music industry, and his work ethic and his instinct were all perfect.

‘But although The X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent have been very successful shows, they are petering out, just like the talent shows that went before them. It is cyclical and you cannot fight it.’

That won’t stop Cowell trying. He has just announced a global talent show, to be screened on YouTube, from the end of this month.

He is also working on a family TV concept, an updated Noel’s House Party, which he plans to pitch in the coming weeks to ITV and the BBC.

At some point, though, the man who is a tireless perfectionist and puts himself under such tremendous pressure, must be forced to realise it is impossible for anyone to remain the best at everything.
