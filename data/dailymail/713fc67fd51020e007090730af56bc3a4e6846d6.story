Pampered Japanese dogs are being treated to snacks made from whales on the edge of extinction.

Michinoku Farm, based in Tokyo, have been selling a jerky-style treat made out of North Atlantic fin whales imported from Iceland.

The firm also sells snacks made from kangaroo hearts and Mongolian horse lungs.

Edge of extinction: One of the fin whales that were hunted in Iceland for the pet treats

They marketed the rare meat as 'low calorie' and 'luxuriously lean' and suitable for dogs with allergies to other meats.

Commercial whaling was banned in 1986, but Iceland and Norway continue to hunt an annual quota in defiance of the ban.

Environmental campaigners are particularly worried about the snack because it is the first time they have noticed whale meat being used for animal consumption, although Japan has been importing fin whale for humans since 2008.

The whale chews came in packets of three sizes, including a 500g bag for 3,780 yen (Â£25).

Nanami
 Kurasawa, executive director of the Japanese campaign group IKAN, 
worries that this was just a status symbol for rich pet owners.

He
 said: 'The most likely reason for shops to sell the whale meat dog 
treat is to target affluent Japanese who want to show off their wealth 
with something different'

Tradition: Iceland and Japan are two of the most prominent countries to continue hunting whales

Retreat: After the protest over the whales being used for pet food, the company has recalled the product

The treats were removed from the Michinoku Farm website after protests from four groups, including the UK-based Environmental Investigation Agency.

Michinoku Farm's president, Takuma Konno, said that he was recalling the product even though it is legal in Japan.

'We just wanted to sell a wide variety of food for dogs,' Mr Konno said.

'Campaigners look at whales as important animals, but we consider dogs to be just as important.'

Hvalur, the Icelandic company that exports the whalemeat, caught 148 fin whales in 2010, but had not slaughtered any for the two following years due to a collapse in demand.
