Her childhood was made a misery by vicious school bullies.

Hollie Robinson was punched, kicked and branded ‘ugly’.

The campaign hit a particularly nasty low when she was sent an emailed petition containing 200 signatures urging her to kill herself.

Every day for two years  Miss Robinson was targeted by her tormentors. She would be physically sick with fear each morning before leaving home  and suffer panic attacks on the school run.

Then and now: Hollie aged 11 (left), when the bullying began; and Hollie now (right). Hollie said: 'I can't describe the hell I
 went through when I was younger. I had
 a big group of friends but they all just turned on me'

Bullied: Hollie Robinson, 22, was kicked, punched and verbally abused every day at school for nearly two years but she's turned her life around and gone on to become a beauty queen and set up an Anti-bullying scheme

She was so scared she spent her 
lunchtimes hiding in the school toilets.But she fought back against the 
beatings and the insults to become an anti-bullying campaigner.

And her confidence received a major 
boost aged 17 when she was scouted at a clothes show by a woman 
recruiting for Miss Blackpool in 2009. She was crowned queen in that 
contest and went on to win a series of beauty pageants including Miss 
West Lancashire in 2011 and Miss Blackpool in 2011.

Miss Robinson, now 22, is hoping to go
 into schools to tell children about the devastating effects bullying 
had on her life in an attempt to help stamp it out.

‘I can’t describe the hell I went 
through when I was younger,’ she said. ‘When I started secondary school,
 I had a big group of friends but all of a sudden they just turned on 
me.

Winner: Hollie Robinson, pictured at Miss West Lancashire 2011 the Miss England Finals, which she says helped her overcome the years of bullying she suffered as a schoolgirl

‘It grew worse and worse and soon I was the girl who everyone bullied. The other kids would call me ugly and say I was a dog.

‘I would be pushed around in the corridors and attacked in the school grounds.

‘I started coming home covered in 
bruises, which I’d hide from my parents, and I’d spend each lunchtime 
locked in the school toilets.

‘People would follow me home from 
school so my mum started picking me up. At first I felt like my home was
 my safe haven but then I started getting emails and messages on MSN 
saying they were going to get me. I didn’t feel safe anywhere.’

Miss Robinson, from Blackpool,  
continued: ‘One day I received  an email which was a petition with 200 
names on it saying  I should commit suicide. It said, “Who thinks Hollie
 Robinson should kill herself?” I’m just so thankful that my mum was in 
the house at the time because if she hadn’t been, I really think I might
 have done something stupid.’

What was their motive? Hollie says that when she looks back now, she thinks the girls were just jealous. Some of the boys used to like her and she thinks maybe that's what started the bullying

Finding her feet: Hollie was visiting a clothes show at the age of 17 with her mother when she was scouted by a woman recruiting for Miss Blackpool Town in 2009 - and her modelling went from strength to strength

The petition proved a turning point. She told her parents the full story and never went back to the school.

She started a new high school in Year 9, where she made many new friends.

‘I tried to put the years of bullying 
behind me but I always lacked so much confidence,’ she said. ‘When 
you’re told you’re ugly and worthless all the time, you start to believe
 it. I felt like I wasn’t worth the air I breathed.

‘When I look back now I think they 
were just jealous. Some of the boys used to like me and so  I think 
maybe that’s what  started it.’

Champion: Hollie has reached the final of the Miss England contest on several occasions, and later this year will take part in the finals of Miss International and Intercontinental 2014

Now Miss Robinson has a career as an 
estate agent and she is setting up her own beauty pageant. She hopes the
 online pageant called Miss Anti-Bullying, will raise awareness of the 
plight of youngsters whose childhoods are destroyed by school bullies.

Miss Robinson said she hopes her story will encourage other girls who are being bullied.

‘I feel like I’ve conquered the 
bullies,’ she said. ‘Taking part in beauty contests has proved to me I 
can do it. It has given me that confidence and has made me feel 
comfortable with being me.

Campaigner: Hollie's Miss Anti-Bullying pageant will raise money for the Beat Bullying charity through a Just Giving page

'I’ve never looked back. I would like to go 
into schools at some point and talk to girls about my experience of 
bullying and show them you can be a good, positive role model.’

She says the online pageant will not be merely about judging people on their looks.

Entrants will also be asked a series of questions about themselves and will be scored appropriately.

The Miss Anti-Bullying pageant aims to raise money for the Beat Bullying charity, through a Just Giving page.
