British speed skater Elise Christie has been disqualified for the third time during the Sochi Winter Olympics.

She ended with a tangle of arms and legs with a fellow competitor on the floor of the Iceberg Skating Palace.

The heartbreaking end of her Olympics came at the final
 bend of the 1,000m short-track semi-final when she collided with Li 
Jianrou of China while lying in second place.

Disqualified: Elise Christie was disqualified from the 1000m short track after crashing for the third time in Sochi

Not again: Christie, who failed to register a result in either the 500m or 1500m, hits the wall in the 1000m

Deliberations: Christie, along with her competitor, was judged to have impeded after lengthy deliberations

The judges disqualified both
 Christie and Li Jianrou.

She was previously disqualified for colliding with an opponent in the 500m after crossing the line in silver-medal position, and then for going inside 
the finishing line in her 1500m heat. She was also abused on Twitter.

Standing
 with her team-mate and boyfriend Jack Whelbourne, the  23-year-old 
Christie said: ‘My  psychologist promised me my luck was coming.’

Wiped out: The Chinese competitor went down and knocked the Scot off balance

Devastated: Christie had made a slick move into a strong position to make the final before being felled

She added: 'The problem 
with short track is that the referees are always different and there is 
no kind of consistency because every referee has a different opinion.

She
 laughed, aware of how much fortune, or misfortune, intervenes in a 
sport lived at 30mph on a blade no wider than a bread knife.

After 
winning her 1,000m heat  earlier in the week, she progressed through the
 quarter-final yesterday evening. So into the semi-final.

Measured: Christie says she respects and accepts the referees call, but didn't have to agree with it

She picks 
up the story of those fateful last few minutes when, after waiting at 
the back of the field of four, she unleashed herself with about three 
laps of the 111m course to run.

‘When I saw the draw come out, I saw 
it was the harder of the two — more like a final — and I was in lane 
three so I decided to save my energy and smash it at the end,’ she said.

‘I knew if I was patient, I had the speed. I was coming around the 
outside and I saw her go wide so I switched inside and pulled tight and 
thought, “I have done it, I don’t need to win because I have qualified”.

'That was all I needed. I would save my energy for the final. But I got 
knocked from behind and fell over. I thought the judge might advance me 
to the final — but I got a penalty.

‘I haven’t talked it through with
 him but he said I pushed her over. The problem with short track is the 
referees are all different and there is no consistency.

‘I always respect the referee’s decision but I don’t agree with it.

‘The
 reasons are confused. In the 500 I was penalised for diving up the 
inside. I thought that was what they were judging.

'This time she tried 
to dive up the inside but I was pushed from behind off the back of my 
skate. I don’t understand his point of view right now.’

Christie, who comes from the Scottish new town of Livingston,
 walked through the tunnel only moments before the final in which she 
should have been competing took place.

The gold medallist was Park 
Seung-hi, whom she had beaten in Friday’s quarter-final. Not only 
that but it was Park she had crashed into in the 1500m,  triggering the 
bullying in cyberspace from irate Korean fans that almost persuaded her 
to withdraw from the Olympics altogether.

Gobsmacked: Christie said didn't understand what she'd done wrong to miss out on a chance at a medal

Statistics so far: The medal table as it stands

Christie, who at 5ft 3in 
cuts a smaller figure than many of her rivals, looked so vulnerable in 
the minutes after her latest and final setback that it was impossible 
not to sympathise with her.

Thankfully, support from the psychologist, Mike Rotherham, and the rest of the team had got her on to
 the start line. She did not cry on this occasion. She had probably run 
out of tears.

‘Everyone here and back home in Britain was brilliant,’
 she said. ‘I got back on my feet. I came out and thought, “I have got 
this”. Last year I could only win from lane one or two; I couldn’t do it
 from three or four. I did those overtakes, which I am really proud of.

‘I haven’t managed that before. I had so much belief in what I was doing and to have the chance taken off is devastating.

‘I
 have never beaten Park Seung-hi, never mind skating around the outside 
of her so I can’t describe how gutted I am that I never even got to 
try.’

Christie said she would be returning to Twitter and getting ready 
for the World Championships in Montreal in March.
