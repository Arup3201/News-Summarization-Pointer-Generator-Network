Two Texas men who were convicted of raping and shooting a woman almost 30 years ago were exonerated yesterday after DNA tests in Dallas County implicated others in the crime. 

As Judge Susan Hawk apologised to James Curtis Williams and Raymond Jackson and declared them formally innocent of aggravated sexual assault, 10 other exonerated men watched in the audience.

Williams and Jackson were convicted of attacking a woman outside a Dallas bar in November 1983 and sentenced to life in prison. The woman was forced into a vehicle at gunpoint, sexually assaulted, shot and left for dead in a field.

Innocent: Judge Susan Hawk apologised to James Curtis Williams and Raymond Jackson and declared them formally innocent of aggravated sexual assault

Reunited: With James Curtis Williams and Raymond Jackson, Dallas County has now cleared 32 convicts in the past decade

‘I hope that you feel like justice was served for you today,’ Hawk said. 'It's heartbreaking and to say I'm sorry is not enough. But I hope you both have very full and happy lives. Congratulations.'

Williams and Jackson shook hands with Hawk and Dallas County District Attorney Craig Watkins, who also apologised. 

Dallas County has now exonerated 32 people since 2001, most of them during Watkins' tenure. Most of the cases, including Monday's, involved faulty eyewitness identifications.

Watkins questioned the criminal justice system's fairness and whether black people were being mistreated. ‘I think we see the similarities in these men and the two that are being exonerated today that has not been addressed,’ he said.

'We need to address that here in Dallas 
County, in our state and in this country. We are doing something wrong 
with our criminal justice system and we need to fix it.’

Now the wrongly-convicted in Texas have joined forces to create the Texas Exoneree Project, helping newly released men rebuild their lives.

'You wish you can help get everybody get out of prison that don't supposed to be there, but you know you are not going to be able to do it,' Christopher Scott, who was wrongly convicted of a murder in 1997, told CBS.

Scott was wrongly identified by a witness and served 13 years behind bars, until the real killer confessed.

'We have a lot of people say: "Man we know how you feel." Man, you don't know how I feel. The only person that know how I feel is the guy that has been in position like me. He know how that feel,' Scott told CBS.

Williams and Jackson certainly do. Both men were included in a photo lineup in the 1983 case because they had been implicated in a separate sexual assault.

The victim picked them out of the photo 
lineup and later identified them in court. They were convicted by an 
all-white in January 1984.

But DNA from the woman's clothing and a rape kit exam was preserved and later tested. The results implicated two other men, Frederick Anderson and Marion Doll Sayles. They have now been charged with attempted capital murder, which does not have a statute of limitations, authorities said.

Jackson, 67, said he was already out on parole when the test results came back, clearing him and Williams. He did not blame the victim.

'She just made a mistake in identity, and I'm just thankful that they had DNA and kept ours,' Jackson said on Monday.

Williams and Jackson pleaded guilty in the other sexual assault case and served shorter sentences for that. Jackson is still on parole for a robbery committed in 1970. He said he hoped to start a business.

Williams said things were 'very complex,' but that his life had been greatly changed. 'It inspires me to do to the same, to go on with my life and do good to others,' he said.
