Juventus are confident reported Manchester United target Arturo Vidal will remain at the club.

The Chilean midfielder has been strongly linked with a move to the Premier League this summer.

The 27-year-old Vidal only signed a new contract with Juve back in December, which will see him tied to the Turin-based club until June 2017.

'All the requirements are there for Vidal not to leave before the end of the transfer market,' Juve general director Giuseppe Marotta told Gazzetta dello Sport.

'The contract extension he signed has made more solid the marriage between Juve and Vidal.

'Vidal has always said he wanted to stay here and we are more than happy to keep him.'

Vidal, who has also been linked with Arsenal, moved to Juve from Bayer Leverkusen in the summer of 2011.

He made 32 league appearances for the Bianconeri last season, scoring 11 times and setting up five others to greatly contribute to Juve clinching their third successive scudetto.

Meanwhile, Italian paper Tuttosport also claimed that Juventus are hopeful that Paul Pogba will sign a new deal with the club.

The 21-year-old had been linked with moves to Chelsea and PSG but John Elkann, Juventus's major shareholder, believes the Frenchman will extend his deal in Turin.
