America is the world's strongest military super power.

Its vast and sophisticated armed forces are trained to handle anything from home security to the Iraq war with a moment's notice.

But in case anybody had forgotten that, the US Air Force has refreshed our memories - by dropping a 2,000lb bomb worth $24,000 on a miniature pirate boat.

Wielding power: A laser-guided GBU-10 targets the mini pirate ship at a training range in the Gulf of Mexico

Floating silently in the Gulf of Mexico on September 4, the boat looked far from threatening.

But metres away, a B1 was creeping into the air, armed with a laser-guided GBU-10.

Originally designed for the Cold War, the GBU-10 was touted as one of the most lethal weapons the Force could wield against Russia. However, it was not used until 1998 fighting Iraq.

Ballistics experts have spent the last few years focussing on the weapon; tailoring it for modern-day use.

The $23,700 bomb (Â£15,000) blasted the toy into cinders as another bomber and a fighter aircraft zoomed menacingly around.

It was a demonstration to show how even their biggest bombs can obliterate small water-borne objects.

The pilots also dropped a 500lb GBU-54 bomb and five other explosives.

Proudly displaying the images on their media page, the Air Force Dyess Air Base explained this tactic would be useful if targeting real-life pirate ships.

The stunt sparked a torrent of jokes on Twitter.

One person tweeted: 'Overkill defined'.

Another said: 'This image is today's Americaniest thing'.

And one man joked: 'Yay! Good guys win!'
