A Polish designer has recreated classic film posters based solely on a minimalist grid of a circle within a square containing diagonal lines.

Michal Krasnopolski, 33, said the aim of the 'less is more' challenge was to create a modernist, minimalist series of posters for film buffs.

Some of his ingenious designs illustrate the films' themes with just one or two lines.

A New Hope: The large circle illustrates the Death Star spaceship from the Star Wars film

The Empire Strikes Back: The designer recreates the 'hyperdrive' moment from the Star Wars film

Return of the Jedi: These two crossed lines reflect the lightsabre battles of the Star Wars film

In one, he evokes the image of 
Superman using just a red diagonal line on a blue background, simulating the 
superhero flying through the sky.

And just one white line on a red background represents a line of heroin for the Pulp Fiction poster.

Two crossed diagonal lines, one red, 
one green, on a black background gives the appearance of clashing 
lightsabres for the Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi poster.

While The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is illustrated by a simple golden circle on a dark green background.

Others are more complex. Mr Krasnopolski
uses half the circle and part of a diagonal line from his basic grid to
create an umbrella shape which illustrates Singin' In The Rain.

Superman: Michal Krasnopolski uses just one diagonal red line on a blue background to emulate the superhero flying

Jaws: Using just three lines in two colours, the designer creates an image of a shark's fin going through water

Pulp Fiction: The single white line represents the line of heroin Uma Thurman takes in the film

Singin' In The Rain: A semi circle and a diagonal line create the iconic umbrella from the musical

Full Metal Jacket: A soldiers helmet is drawn from just two semi circles on a khaki background

He also joins three of the lines to create a triangle - making a shark's fin shape for his Jaws poster.

He said: 'It surprised me how many posters I could create based on this very 
simple approach; the possibilities are theoretically unlimited.'

The artist and graphic designer lives in Warsaw, Poland and has a Master's degree from the Academy of Fine Arts in Lodz.

He usually works with the advertising 
industry creating campaigns and packaging. Mr Krasnopolski has won 
several awards for his design work.
