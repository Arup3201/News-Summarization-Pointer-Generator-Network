The special bond between a severely disabled boy and his dog has been recognised at Crufts. 

Rescue dog Miracle beat off 200 other entrants to scoop the prestigious Friends For Life award.

The crossbreed was saved from Thailand's illegal dog meat trade a couple of years ago and adopted by Amanda Leask from Strathglass, Scotland, and her six year old son Kyle.

Six year old Kyle has developed an incredibly close bond with his canine companion Miracle 

Miracle was snatched from the streets of north east Thailand and loaded onto a truck with hundreds of other stolen dogs, all destined for the dog meat restaurants of Hanoi in Vietnam.

Luckily for Miracle, the truck carrying him to his death was intercepted by agents working for the Phuket-based animal welfare charity Soi Dog Foundation.

The dogs were taken to a purpose-built shelter in Thailand, where they were then put up for adoption.

Amanda Leask spotted Miracle’s photo shortly after he’d been rescued on a Soi Dog Facebook post.

Devastated by his plight and the hopelessness of his situation, she enquired about adopting him.

Already an owner of three rescue dogs from Soi Dog, Amanda very soon had her fourth. 

And while Miracle quickly got to work returning the favour to his new owner by creating a powerful bond with her son Kyle that transformed the young boy's life. 

Kyle was born with cerebral palsy, and was later diagnosed with autism.

His condition means that it is incredibly difficult for him to communicate with his family.

After learning that autistic people can develop extremely close relationships with canine pets, Amanda decided to adopt some dogs.

Kyle and Miracle have since developed a close bond, which Amanda says reveals an unspoken mutual understanding.

Amanda (pictured here with Miracle and Kyle) says there is an 'unspoken language' between the hound and her disabled son

She said: 'They’ve both faced so much hardship in their lives, it’s like there’s an unspoken language between them. 

'When Kyle gets upset because he can’t convey what he wants to, Miracle will go and lay at his side for Kyle to touch and stroke.

'Miracle seems to automatically know when Kyle needs him.'

'If Kyle simply wants some attention, Miracle will go over and shower him with kisses, and it works the other way too.'

She continued: 'Kids can build up confidence in dogs where they seek solace, and Miracle gets this in abundance from Kyle.'

The unique bond between man and dog is still yet to be explained fully but Amanda says the amount it has helped Kyle is unlimited. 

She said: 'He seems so much happier in the presence of Miracle. 

'It’s like they’re soul mates.'

Miracle won £1,500 for his Crufts Eukaneba Friends for Life award, and Amanda will share the money between Soi Dog and the Autistic Society.
