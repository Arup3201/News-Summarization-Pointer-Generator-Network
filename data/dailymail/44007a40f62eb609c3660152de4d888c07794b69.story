A bar bill that runs into six figures might cause more than a headache the next morning for most people.

But when you're a millionaire American gambler buying the world's most expensive bottle of champagne it's just a case of using up small change.

Gambler Don Johnson, 49, broke the world record at a London nightclub for the most expensive bottle of bubbly ever bought during a night that saw him spend £170,000 ($271,000) on drinks.

Careful, don't spill it: Businessman and gambler Don Johnson spray revellers with £120,000 champagne bought from the One For One nightclub in Park Lane, London, over the weekend

Best bubbly in town: Mr Johnson enjoys the taste of wealth as revelers help to lift the impressive bottle which broke the record for the previous most expensive champagne at £15,000

Mr Johnson paid a whopping £120,000 
($191,000) for the extravagantly decorated 45kg bottle holding 30 litres of 
bubbly over the weekend.

The businessman made the purchase while chalking up a £168,118 bill during a trip to Park Lane's swanky One For One nightclub.

The star, who was in town visiting rock star pal Bon Jovi, started the night with a relatively cheap bottle of Dom Perignon Luminous Magnum 2002 for £750. This was followed by a bottle of Grey Goose Magnum at £420.

Ouch! A till receipt from the club shows how Mr Johnson racked up almost £170,000

After four complimentary bottles of soda water and four cans of red bull for £5, Mr Johnson splashed out with a £25,000 Armand De Brignac Methuselah.

But then the atmosphere, and perhaps the previous drink, appears to have brought out the big spender in Mr Johnson

He heard the nightclub had recently commissioned the biggest bottle of champagne ever made, the Armand De Brignac Midas, and he ordered the bank-breaking bubbly.

Taking to the stage, Johnson grabbed a microphone and popped the cork.

He then sprayed the room with champagne and glugged from the bottle.

The generous gambler then offered swigs of the classy drink to thrilled revellers.

However, according to a friend, themillionaire - known as The Champagne King - doesn’t even like the taste of the French sparkling wine.

A single litre of the alcohol is worth £4,000 and would fill eight champagne flutes, each worth £500.

The previous record for most expensive bottle of champagne was held by the Armand De Brignac (Ace of Spades) Nebuchadnezzar, a 15 litre bottle.

The champagne was bought by an anonymous customer at One for One for £80,000.

Johnson, who has become notorious for his partying lifestyle, is set to host Pamela Anderson's Birthday Party in Las Vegas this summer.

Earlier this year Mr Johnson beat the Tropicana Casino and Resort in Bensalem, Pennsylvania,  for $5.8 million at blackjack.

The win was part of a spectacular roll that also saw him beat Caesars Atlantic City for more than $4.2 million and the Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa for $5 million.

It was the first time a casino has lost money in blackjack over a sustained period since gambling in the city was legalised in 1978.

The incredible wins are just a tiny proportion windfalls he has had throughout his career.

Nik Krasniqi, floor manager at the £950-a-year members club, said: 'Everyone was gathered round his table and he was on the microphone singing Bon Jovi songs, screaming ''I love London''.

Winemakers Armand de Brignac released the 'Midas' in January. It is a 30-litre vessel equivalent to 40 regular-sized 750ml bottles and weighing 100 pounds. 

The bottle’s name, Midas, comes from King Midas, remembered in Greek mythology for the ability to turn whatever he touched to gold. Two grown men are typically needed to carry it.

Champagne bottles of this size were banned for 75 years beginning around the turn of the 20th century, until glassmaking techniques made bottles safe from explosion due to the pressure of a large volume of Champagne in a single vessel.

Armand de Brignac is the luxury Champagne from the award-winning Champagne Cattier chateau of Chigny-les-Roses, France. 

Instantly identifiable by the dramatic Ace of Spades insignias on its bottle, Armand de Brignac boasts three prestige cuvées - Brut Gold, Rosé and Blanc de Blancs. 

Ranked the number one Champagne in the world in a blind-tasting of over 1,000 brands, Armand de Brignac exemplifies unmatched winemaking expertise and a true passion for the art of Champagne.

'He was hugging the bottle and everyone 
in the club was going wild. When he left, the ceiling, the floor and 
everyone in the club was covered in champagne. 

'His goal is to be the biggest spender ever in nightclubs all over the world. He is in Vegas and he wanted to do it in London.

'He likes to party very, very hard. He had the microphone and was screaming ''Don Mother F*****g Johnson'' over and over.'

Johnson’s lifestyle manager, Sophie Raibin from Raibin Productions, said along with champagne, the millionaire loves to shower people with his generosity.

She said: 'The last time Don was in London he spent more than £100,000 in a week. 'This time he did it in one night.

'He has spent millions of pounds on champagne in his life, he gives away and just wants people to have fun.

'He doesn’t like to drink champagne, although he had quite a lot to drink last night. He’s not acquired the taste, he prefers to drink vodka.

'His favourite thing is the microphone, he is known for it and he loves it. He is very good at getting a crowd going. You’ve got to see it to believe it.'

Sophie said the enormous bottle proved difficult to get into after the cork snapped twice.

Sophie said: 'In the end we had to get some pliers to get it out.

'It took a while but when it opened it went everywhere – every single person in the room was sprayed. The crowd went ballistic I’ve never seen anything like it.'
