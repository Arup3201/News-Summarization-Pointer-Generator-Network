Brace yourself, Rodney... Brace yourself!

These two handymen have more than a little touch of glass... as they polish a giant chandelier in Vienna.

The pair climbed onto the giant candelabrum at City Hall in the Austrian capital in scenes that echo a famous 1982 sketch from hit Brit sitcom Only Fools and Horses.

But luckily for them it wasn't 'international year of the wallybrain' - as Del Boy astutely puts it - and they managed to clean the ceiling fixture breaking nothing more than a sweat.

A glass act: These two handymen have more than a little touch of glass... as they polish a giant chandelier in Vienna

Brace yourself, Rodney! The scene echoed a famous sketch from hit Brit sitcom Only Fools and Horses in which Rodney (left), played by Nicholas Lyndhurst, and Del Boy (right), played by David Jason, unsuccessfully attempt to clead a pair of priceless Louis XIV chandeliers

Things did not, however work out so happily for Del Boy and Rodney in the 1982 episode of Only Fools and Horses that sees the hapless pair - played by David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst - attempt to polish a chandelier in a country house.

During a trip out to the countryside Kent to buy a consignment of musical china cats which play the song 'How much is that doggie in the window?', Del Boy, Rodney and Grandad find themselves in the inadvertent employ of a wealthy aristocrat who hires them to clean two priceless Louis XIV chandeliers.

Year of the wallybrain? But luckily for them it wasn't 'international year of the wallybrain' - as Del Boy so astutely puts it

High up: The chandelier hangs above Vienna City Hall's Council Chamber, where members of the City Council and Diet convene

Pros: The pair expertly shimmied across the ceiling fixture with apparent ease as they cleaned it without breaking more than a sweat

Striking: According to the City Hall's website, the 'most striking feature of this 14-metre-high room is a huge chandelier in the historicist style, with a diameter of five metres and 213 lights. It was cast in one piece, weighs 3,200 kilogrammes and can be entered by maintenance personnel to change the lamps'

Frescoes: The coffered ceiling of high-grade larch and spruce wood is decorated with 22-carat gold-leaf rosettes while, drectly below the ceiling, a series of frescoes depicts events from the history of Austria and Vienna

When they arrive to perform the job, Del Boy sends Grandad upstairs to unscrew the holding bolt for one of the chandeliers while he and Rodney climb up step ladders with a blanket ready to catch it when it falls.

Unbeknownst to them, however, Grandad is unscrewing the wrong chandelier and, sure enough, as they brace themselves to catch the antique above them, the other one crashes to the floor, shattering in pieces.
