A 20-year-old mother accused of beating her two-year-old son to death last year and then burying his body in a shallow grave has given birth to another baby while in custody.

Meagan Work, from Austin, Texas, gave birth to a son in February, Fox7 reported, but it is not known if she gave birth in jail or at the hospital, or if she was permitted to spend time with him.

Child Protective Services took the child into state custody and on Monday, a hearing was held to determine if he will stay in foster care or live with a family member, KVUE reported.

Officials told the channel that State District Judge Darlene Byrne will likely make a decision in upcoming days where to place the baby boy.

The baby's father is believed to be Michael Brandt Turner, who is also charged in the death of Work's two-year-old son, Colton Brandt Turner. Michael Turner was not Colton's biological father.

Work was four months pregnant when she was arrested in her son's death last September after his remains were found hidden in a wooded area. 

A friend who was concerned about the boy's whereabouts had contacted authorities. 

Following the call, investigators interviewed Turner at San Saba County Jail, where he was being held on unrelated offenses.

A day later, Turner took them to the site where he admitted burying the body  in July. 

A witness told police that he had seen Work slam her son's head against a truck before shaking and slapping him on July 7.

Work, who had been living out of her car or with friends in the months before the death, told police different stories about her son's whereabouts, including that he had been kidnapped from their car and that she had given him to a couple she met in a restaurant. 

Killed: Colton's body was found in a shallow grave in a wooded area last September. His mother, pictured, had different accounts of what had happened to him but eventually admitted he had died in a motel room

Abuse: Relatives posted pictures of bruises and scratches across his body before he died. CPS had two open complaints against his mother when he died but because she was homeless, they could not find her

She eventually told investigators he died in motel room, according to an arrest affidavit. 

After his death, it emerged that relatives had shared photos of his injured body on Facebook, including deep scratches and bruises to his head and back.

Texas Child Protective Services had received four total complaints beginning when Colton was about six months old, KVUE reported at the time.

Accused: Work's boyfriend Michael Turner, 29, led authorities to the boy's buried body last year

Two of the complaints had been resolved and the other two were open and ongoing when investigators discovered Colton's body. CPS were unable to resolve them because they could not find the homeless mother.

Work, who had previously pleaded guilty to animal cruelty and assault charges, is now charged with injury to a child in the death while Turner is charged with injury to a child by omission.

Work remains in the Travis County Jail. 

A Travis County Sheriff's spokesman said deputies typically take mothers to a hospital to deliver babies, but would not provide any details on Work's case citing federal medical privacy laws.

Work's aunt and a family friend issued a statement to Fox7 about her new child.

'In order to protect this child from undue duress surrounding this tragedy, we decline all requests for comment,' they wrote. 'Please understand that Colton's Law will save and protect thousands of children per year in Texas from suffering the same fate as Colton.' 

Colton's Law seeks to make it easier for law enforcement to find people who are running from CPS during investigations, as Work was before Colton's death. 

'Colton’s Law would mandate state law enforcement to step in to search in cases where the child cannot be located and is in danger,' the family explains on their Facebook page. 

Both Work and Turner will next appear in court on April 13.
