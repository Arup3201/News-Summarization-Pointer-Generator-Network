Jailed: Lithuanians Audruis Andriukaitis (pictured) and Rygintas Bloze attacked a workmate after wrongly assuming he was Russian

A Lithuanian man was subjected to a savage beating by two workmates and fellow countrymen after they downed so much vodka at a Christmas get-together they wrongly assumed he was Russian.

Igor Kuznecov, 27, was knocked to the floor and had his face repeatedly stamped on as though his attackers were 'flattening a tin can', a court heard.

He also was thrown around the street by Audruis Andriukaitis, 25, and Rygintas Bloze, 42 - both workmates of his at a Lancashire furniture factory - in an attack so vicious one onlooker feared he was witnessing a murder.

Before the attack Mr Kuznecov and his assailants had been drinking vodka together on Christmas Day, but violence flared in the early hours of the following morning when the trio ran out of alcohol and the victim began speaking in Russian, Burnley Crown Court was told.

Andriukaitis and former soldier Bloze started calling Mr KuznecovÂ  - who was born in Lithuania but is a fluent Russian speaker - a 'Russian' and telling him they wanted to put him in a dog kennel as they launched their attack.

Mr Kuznecov was left motionless, bleeding and 'completely out of it' after his sustained ordeal, the court heard. He was later found to have suffered serious facial injuries, including a smashed left eye socket and nasal bone.

Andriukaitis and Bloze, both of Nelson, were each sentenced to four years in prison after admitting causing grievous bodily harm with intent. They now face deportation.

Stephen Parker, prosecuting, said the victim had celebrated Christmas Day at Andriukaitis' home. Both had been drinking vodka before they left to go to Bloze's home nearby.

In the early hours of Boxing Day as the group tried to find a shop selling alcohol the two attackers became aggressive and called him a 'Russian', before the victim suddenly felt a blow to the back of the head.

Eye witness Mohammed Daar, who awoken by a thud outside his bedroom window, looked outside and saw a man pinned over his car wing mirror on the street.

He saw Bloze holding the victim in a headlock as he was punched, before dragging him down the street, the court heard.

Mr Daar called the police and gave them a running commentary of the events unfolding outside his window.

Sentencing: Burnley Crown Court was told an eye-witness to the attack feared Mr Kuznecov would be killed

Mr Parker said Andriukaitis kicked the victim three or four times in the face and Bloze punched him in the stomach. Mr Kuznecov was released, taken in a bear hug from behind and the attackers threw him onto the road.

The pair kicked their workmate in the stomach and head repeatedly before dragging him to his feet and pushing him into a parked car, the court heard.

Andriukaitis then pinned him down and hit him in the face more than 10 times before Bloze walked over and kicked Mr Kuznecov in the face.

The court heard the witness had described the attackers stamping on their victims face as though they were trying to 'flatten a can', and using so much force that Mr Daar had feared Mr Kuznecov was dead.

Mr Parker said: 'Mr Daar says he honestly thought he was witnessing somebody being murdered, such was the nature of the attack.

'Mr Kuznecov later told police the defendants had wanted to put him in a kennel. The victim said to them they did it because they were Lithuanians and he was Russian.'

Mr Kuznecov still suffers flashbacks and headaches and his sleep has been affected as a result of his ordeal, the court heard.

Philip Holden, representing father-of-one Andriukaitis said: 'He is, to all intents and purposes, a hard- working member of society but he had drunk more than was good for him.'

Defending Bloze, Mark Stuart said : 'It can only be more by luck than by management that the injuries weren't more serious than they were.'Mr Recorder John Barrett, sentencing, said the attack was in many ways inexplicable, but added it was plain alcohol had played a part.

'This was a persistent and sustained attack in the street,' the judge said.

'It took place over a period of 15 minutes or so. It caused distress to members of the public, in particular Mr Daar. The injuries are astoundingly modest.'
