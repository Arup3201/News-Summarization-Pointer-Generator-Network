A runaway dustbin lorry wreaked havoc in a Sheffield street yesterday when it smashed into two cars andÂ  flattened a lamppost, before finally careering into a shocked pensioner's front door.

Amazingly no-one was hurt after the Veolia wagon started on its trail of destruction when it took off down a hill at 9.45am while on its round in the South Yorkshire city.

Jamie Smedley's silver Vauxhall van was among the wreckage after it was picked up by the truck and dragged down the street.

Destruction: The runaway dustcart slammed into two cars before smashing into a pensioner's front door

The 28-year-old shopfitter said: 'I was in the house when I heard this "thud, thud, thud" and then a "bang".

'I came outside and saw the wagon had crashed into the house opposite, and my van, which had been parked at the bottom of my drive, was at the side of it.

'The lorry had hit a black Corsa first and pulled that along the road, then dragged my car down the street, across the road and into the house.

'There was an elderly lady in at the time. I think she was a bit shaken up.'

Mr Smedley added: 'Veolia couldn't apologise enough. I was just glad there were no kids playing out.

Shocked: A pensioner was at home when the truck crashed into their front door much to their surprise

Diane Clayton, who owns the black Corsa, said: 'I heard a "bang" and the next thing my neighbour came to alert me that my car had been damaged.'

The 59-year-old, who works as a housekeeper at the Northern General Hospital, added both of vehicles would probably have to be written off.

Police were called to the scene to direct traffic and National Grid was called in to fix the flattened street light.

A Veolia spokeswoman said: 'We would like to apologise to all concerned. No-one was injured but there was some damage to vehicles and property.

'We are carrying out an immediate investigation. We take health and safety extremely seriously.'
