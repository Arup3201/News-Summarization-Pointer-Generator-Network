The defence against former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura's defamation lawsuit against slain 'American Sniper' author Chris Kyle began yesterday

Jesse Ventura was punched out in 2006 at a California bar, a woman told a court yesterday, contradicting the former wrestler-cum-politician's claim that the incident never happened.

Laura deShazo was called as the first defence witness in Ventura's defamation case against the estate of Chris Kyle, the late Navy SEAL who described the alleged fight in his autobiography.

Mr Kyle wrote in his best-selling book, American Sniper, that he punched a man he called 'Scruff Face' that night who loudly said the Navy SEALs 'deserve to lose a few'.

According to the account, he had been at the bar on a military base with a large group of SEALs and family members attending a wake for a fallen comrade.

Mr Kyle, who claimed to be the deadliest military sniper in U.S. history, later identified the man as Ventura, a former governor of Minnesota and pro wrestler who calls himself a former SEAL.

Ms deShazo, of Salt Lake City, was there for the wake because her brother was on the same SEAL team. While there, she, her sister and her brother's girlfriend posed for a picture with Ventura, which was shown in court.

She said she later saw Ventura get into a 'scruffle with a group of people' and saw a man punch him.

She said she doesn't know who threw the punch and didn't know Mr Kyle, but she gave a description that was consistent with him.

However Ms deShazo's testimony conflicted with a sworn video deposition Mr Kyle gave before he was slain in Texas last year.

She said she was 'positive' the confrontation happened on the patio at the pub. Mr Kyle said it happened out on the sidewalk. She said she didn't see what else happened and didn't see Ventura go down as Mr Kyle claimed.

'It was a time of mourning for us. A bar fight was not a priority for me,' she told the court.

Ms deShazo's statements led off what is expected to be a week of testimony from people who told attorneys they saw small pieces of the alleged incident but not the entire thing.

The defence last week said the pieces will add up to a whole that vindicates Mr Kyle, while Ventura's lawyer said the accounts are riddled with inconsistencies that make them unreliable.

Ventura testified again yesterday that there was no fight and that Mr Kyle fabricated the story.

2006 - Jesse Ventura allegedly 'badmouthed' Navy SEALs and the Iraq War at a wake for a SEAL killed in action and was punched in the face by Chris Kyle.

January 3, 2012 - Mr Kyle's autobiography, American Sniper, is published with an account of the alleged incident, but without identifying Ventura as the man involved.

January 4, 2012 - Mr Kyle appears on the Opie and Anthony Show to promote his book and, in response to a call-in question, claims it was Ventura who he punched

January 8, 2012 - Ventura appears on the Alex Jones radio show to deny the rumours. He files a defamation lawsuit and demands Mr Kyle retracts the claims

February 2, 2013 - Mr Kyle is shot dead along with his friend at a shooting range in Erath County, Texas, in an unrelated incident.

In his second day on the stand, Ventura, who now makes his living mostly off TV, said he blames the book for a 90 per cent drop in his earnings since it came out in January 2012.

He said job offers have dried up as a result.

Ventura said he earned close to $11million from 2002-2012. The defence introduced income tax returns showing his income was in decline over the period.

He enjoyed a high of $3.8million in 2003, while under contract to MSNBC. He made $676,455 in 2011, before the book came out, during the last season of his truTV series 'Conspiracy Theory.'

Ventura made $190,378 in 2012 and said he thinks truTV canceled the series because of the controversy over Kyle's book. But he acknowledged he can't prove it.

But Kyle estate attorney Chuck Webber suggested the falloff was Ventura's own fault because of what the lawyer called his propensity for making outrageous and offensive statements on TV and in his own books.

Besides the financial hit, Ventura said Mr Kyle's story hurt his reputation within the tight-knit SEAL community. He said he no longer feels welcome at reunions.

'It's a hole in my heart,' he testified.

Ventura and Mr Kyle were at the pub near a SEAL base in Coronado on October 12, 2006. Ventura was in town for a SEAL reunion, while Mr Kyle was there for the wake for Michael Monsour, who threw himself on a grenade.

Mr Kyle said in his deposition that Ventura was being offensive and that he thought Ventura was about to hit him, so he decked him first.
