The days of awkwardly trying to wing your way in a foreign language could soon be over.

Microsoft has unveiled their new Skype Translator technology that they say can decode languages in real-time.

It means that during video calls the speech recognition software will allow two callers from different countries to talk with ease.

Microsoft has revealed their language translation software for Skype (pictured). Known as Skype Translator, it will enable people with two different dialects to communicate using voice or video calling, with the software then translating what they say into text and voice so that the other person can understand

Microsoft first unveiled the technology two years ago.

At the time, though, it was deemed too inaccurate to release to the general public.

But a recent breakthrough by the Skype and Microsoft Translator teams in neural network-based speech recognition has reduced errors in speech recognition by more than 30 per cent.

In a blog post Microsoft says Skype has more than 300 million users, while at least 2 billion minutes of conversation are spoken every day.

Skype can be used across a variety of devices including computers, smartphones, tablets and TVs.

It allows users to either voice-call or video-call friends and family anywhere in the world without the large costs of regular phone tariffs.

Microsoft says Skype has more than 300 million users around the world, who in turn speak 2 billion minutes of conversation every day. Skype is available for a number of devices including computers, tablets (Windows tablet shown) and smartphones and lets people make calls over the internet

Now Skype Translator could allow people who normally wouldn't be able to understand one another to communicate.

Skype Translator is a spin-off of the technology behind Microsoft's Siri clone called Cortana, the personal voice assistant on Windows Phones.

In a demo, Microsofts show a conversation with real-time audio translation between and English and German speakers using Skype Translator.

The foreign language is converted into subtitles for the other person, and then spoken aloud by a chosen voice.

The quick translations allow for a back and forth conversation even though the two don't speak the same language.

Microsoft, however, say it is still early days for the technology ‘but the Star Trek vision for the universal translator’ isn’t a galaxy away.’

By the end of 2014 Skype Translator will be available as a Windows 8.1 beta app, although no news on when a full release will be brought to other platforms has yet been announced.
