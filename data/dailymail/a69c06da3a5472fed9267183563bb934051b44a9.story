A rare dummy parachuted into occupied Europe to bamboozle the Germans on D-Day and draw their forces from the actual invasion has been found in a garden shed.

At least 500 of the 3ft stunt puppets were dropped along with SAS soldiers at four spots away from the Normandy beaches to take the enemy away from genuine drop zones.

Sent in the middle of the night, these canvas 'paradummies' - nicknamed Ruperts - were designed to burst into flames when they landed so the Germans could not find them.

But one has survived combat and has been 
discovered at the bottom of a British garden along with some once top 
secret maps and documents.

Rare finds: A dummy parachutist that was one of 500 dropped over France on D-Day to confuse the enemy has been found in a garden shed with a number of maps, documents and artefacts

Six SAS soldiers were parachuted in 
with the dolls, with equipment playing the sounds of a loud battle to make 
the subterfuge even more realistic.

Although they were half the size of a human, they would have 
appeared lifelike to those looking up from the ground on a dark night.

Meanwhile thousands of Allied airmen 
landed elsewhere during the early hours of June 6, 1944,
 ahead of the invasion from the Channel.

The 'paradummy' was discovered at the bottom of a garden along 
with a set of RAF maps for a team tasked with spotting the results of 
the Royal Naval 
bombardment of the German defences on D-Day.

Subterfuge: 500 of the dolls were dropped into France on the night of June 6, 1944 at the time of the Allied landing in Normandy

Skillful: The dummies fell in areas away from the beaches and genuine drop zones used on D-Day (pictured) to draw away German forces

Inspiration: These dolls were featured in The Longest Day (pictured), a 1962 hit film about the D-Day landings

The artefacts were found by
 a woman who was clearing out her late grandparents' belongings and it 
is not known how the item made its way back from Normandy to Britain.

The Allies tried all they could to confuse the enemy on D-Day and used top secret inventions to gain the upper hand.

On the eve of battle planes flew back and forth across the Channel to drop bundles of 'window', now known as chaff, to disrupt enemy radar.

Just ten bombers used the technique to make the enemy believe hundreds of 'ghost' aircraft were above them. The bombers then jammed German radio over Northern France to hide the 1,000 aircraft that were on their way to drop parachutists behind enemy lines.

When the beach landings happened men used rocket-propelled grappling hooks attached to ropes and ladders to climb the steep Normandy cliffs in minutes rather than hours.

They were then followed by 'Donald Duck' Sherman tanks, which floated and used the engine to drive through water and up onto the beaches.

Kevin
 King, of Buckinghamshire-based auctioneers Marlow's which has sold it 
for £900 said: 'It is quite rare to come across previously 
unknown paradummies now.

'Back in the 1970s a whole batch of them were found on an airfield and some of them are in museums now.

'The woman vendor was having a bit of a clear out of her grandfather's shed when she found it.'

The deception, known as 'Operation Titanic', did draw German 
troops away from the Normandy beaches.

The Ruperts were made from hessian cloth and would have been filled with sand and straw at the time. They featured in the famous 1962 D-Day movie The Longest Day.

Mr King said: 'If the paradummies were any bigger than not that many of them would have fitted on the aircrafts.

'When
 an object is high up in the air it is very difficult to get a proper 
perspective of it from the ground, especially in darkness.'

During the war the Americans also dropped their own dummies and called them Oscars. 

It was an idea stolen from the Germans, who had used the technique when it attacked the Netherlands in 1940.

They have also been used in the Vietnam war as well as the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.
