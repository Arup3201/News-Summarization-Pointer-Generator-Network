HANDS OFF IN THE BOX is our new campaign to rid football of the dark arts of the penalty box.

Whether it is wrestling, grappling, shirt pulling - or the outrageous headlocks witnessed in the Manchester United vs Chelsea match - the area has become a free-for-all for cheating.

And that means fewer goals in the Barclays Premier League.

For too long, referees have failed to punish players for blatantly stopping opponents from scoring. It's time to end that.

So join us in our campaign to say Hands Off In The Box to players and referees.

We’ll be naming and shaming the cheats and the officials who let them get away with it.

Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini has added his voice to Sportsmail's campaign to stop the amount of fouls that take place in penalty boxes across the Premier League.

The Hands Off In The Box campaign aims to rid football of the dark arts in the penalty area.

Acts such as wrestling, grappling and shirt pulling are now commonplace, as was so shockingly illustrated in the 1-1 draw between Manchester United and Chelsea on Sunday as Marcos Rojo and Chris Smalling manhandled John Terry and Branislav Ivanovic respectively to the ground in brutal fashion.

Both United defenders went unpunished.

And the Manchester City manager has revealed that he shares the concerns that many have over the amount of blatantly stopping opponents from scoring.

'When the Premier League managers met [with referees] at the start of the season, this was one of the things we talked about,' he said.

'We said that that there was a lot going on and that were a lot of penalties [not being given].

'It is definitely something that happens and it is very hard for the referees.

'Equally, there are lots of fouls of goalkeepers – where the goalkeeper is not being allowed to move – and that is a problem also.'

But Sportsmail feels that enough is enough.

It's time referees and assistants eradicated bodychecking and wrestling inside the box, just as tackles from behind have been, and reckless challenges are in the process of being now.

Guilty defenders must be named and shamed - if everyone knows who the cheats are, referees will have no excuse not to punish serial offenders.

John Terry, Chelsea captain

‘Me and Branislav Ivanovic were double headlocked at every corner.’

Colin Pascoe, Liverpool assistant manager

‘Grappling. That is the new word is it? It is the referees’ interpretation and we’ll leave it to them. That’s what the referees and the officials are paid for. They make decisions. So whatever they decide is grappling, or holding, it’s in their hands really. Did I do it as player? No, I was a winger and didn’t have to mark anyone.’ 

Ian Wright, Ex-Arsenal striker

‘There should be an official specifically looking for holding in the box from set-pieces. It was like UFC in the United area.’

Graham Poll, Former top referee

‘Hold or grapple and you can expect to be cautioned. Once fans, managers and — crucially — players accept it as normal, this campaign will have achieved its aims.’

Martin Keown, Ex-Arsenal defender

‘Defenders are checking, blocking, holding, grappling, using force to foul opponents — and too often referees are allowing it to take place.’

Micky Mellon, Shrewsbury Town manager

‘In a congested area how can you judge if someone’s been blocked? It’s part of the game and some people are good at it. It’s football. A local Football League referee came in and he was asking me about it. “Can you show me some blocking techniques?” That was great, he was trying to find ways of detecting it. The confusing thing for managers is that fouls outside the area are given as free-kicks, but the same won’t be given as penalties. There has to be consistency.’

And the readers of MailOnline...

‘It’s more infuriating because we never hear from the refs themselves. It’s about time the refs were made to answer the media just like players.’ Willdajack, Neath

‘To those saying if there was a clampdown every game would be littered with penalties, that would be true for a couple of weeks then it would stop. I’ve been watching football since the Sixties and the cheating behaviour in the penalty area now is the worst I’ve ever seen.’ Sir Miles Platting, Manchester
