David Cameron and Angela Merkel were at loggerheads tonight after only one country backed Britain and France’s call to arm the Syrian rebels.

At a summit in Brussels today, the Prime Minister and French president Francois Hollande urged other European leaders to back their call for the lifting of an EU-wide arms embargo on the war-torn state.

But they embarrassingly found themselves in a minority of three - with only Slovenia coming out to support their stance.

Head to head: David Cameron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel came to verbal blows after Merkel refused to support Britain and France in their call to lift the EU-wide arms embargo on Syria

German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned of the danger that lifting the embargo could lead to arms falling into the hands of dangerous Islamists.

And the Austrians threatened to pull their UN troops out of the Golan Heights - land disputed between Israel and Syria - if Britain and France unilaterally lifted their embargo.

Mr Cameron and President Hollande warned that if they did not get the support they needed, they would effectively veto the extension of the existing EU ban on supplying weapons to either side of the bloody conflict, which has already claimed more than 70,000 lives.

This would enable countries that wished to do so to supply the rebels.

Mr Cameron believes it is becoming increasingly important to arm ‘moderate’ rebels to prevent the uprising being taken over by jidahist fighters who are flooding into the country.

A Downing Street source said there was a ‘perversity’ about the existing arms embargo, which meant that the rebels were receiving no outside help when Russia and Iran are arming Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.

Moscow has been the main ally of Assad, shielding him from UN sanctions and supplying him with weapons during the two-year conflict.

But despite Britain and France’s forthright arguments at the EU council meeting in Brussels yesterday, only one country - Slovenia - came out in support.

Chancellor Merkel said she was concerned weapons would end up in the wrong hands.

‘It is an extremely difficult situation,’ she said at a press conference. ‘We have a whole series of reservations regarding weapons exports to the opposition. We have to ask ourselves whether we are not further fuelling the conflict by doing that.’

Action: French President Francois Hollande, pictured with his partner Valerie Trierweiler, has said he wants the weapons embargo lifted with immediate effects

‘We all are deeply concerned about the
desperate situation in Syria,’ she said. ‘Europe can only play a strong
and effective role if it acts as one. If partners want to revisit 
common decisions we should hear them out and decide jointly.’

EU foreign policy chief Baroness Cathy
Ashton said that lifting the arms blockade could be seized on by 
supporters of the regime to channel even more arms to bolster Assad’s 
military campaign.

And Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte warned the UK and France against unilateral action.

In
a post-summit press conference yesterday, Mr Cameron said he disagreed 
with Chancellor Merkel’s position - saying arms were going to the wrong 
people now.

He said: ‘That 
is what has happened already and actually it’s important for countries 
like Britain and France, working with the Americans, working with other 
allies, to help the opposition to work with the opposition and shape the
opposition and to make sure that it is those parts of the opposition 
that support a democratic, pluralistic Syria where minorities are 
properly protected, those are the organisations getting our help and 
getting our assistance.’

However,
Mr Cameron’s language was much less bellicose than President Hollande, 
who has said he would like to start arming the Syrian rebels now.

The Prime Minister said: ‘As things stand today I’m not saying that Britain would actually like to supply arms to rebel groups. What we want to do is work with them and try to make sure that they are doing the right thing.

‘Britain is a sovereign country. We have our own foreign, security and defence policies. If we want to take individual action, of course we are free to do so.’

He went on: ‘You can either keep renewing that common position or you can decide not to renew that common position.

‘If we thought our national interest was best met in another way, we would always stand up for British interests.

‘It is worth standing back and asking: why are we debating and discussing the approach we take? The answer is two years in, 70,000 people are dead, there is a huge refugee and humanitarian crisis, Assad is still in place and being strongly supplied and strengthened by others and we need to put pressure on to bring about the transition necessary for Syrian people, necessary for stability in that region and in our national interest.’

Mr Cameron said it would be wrong for Austria to pull out of the Golan Heights, because arming the Syrian rebels was a completely different issue.

Speaking at his own press conference, President Hollande said France wanted to arm the rebels.

‘We are fighting terrorism around the world,’ he said. ‘We have been helping the opposition in Syria and want to go further. We trust the opposition - we do not want Syria to become another Libya.’
