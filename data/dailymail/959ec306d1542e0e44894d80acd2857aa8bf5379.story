For many, the prospect of yet another coffee shop opening on the local high street is enough to keep them awake at night.

Others, however, welcome any chance to feed their caffeine addiction – and the big coffee companies are only too happy to oblige.

British-owned Costa is opening shops across the country at the rate of three a week, it emerged yesterday.

Caffeine rush: Many high streets appear to have hit saturation point in terms of the big chain coffee shops, however Costa insists there is room for hundreds more

It already has 1,755 outlets nationwide and plans to add another 150 this year, taking it towards a target of 2,200 by 2018.

The chain, part of the Whitbread group, has become so successful that is has now exporting its format from Paris to Beijing.

It has around 1,000 coffee shops overseas, including 326 in China, with plans for many more.

Traditionally,
 coffee shops have been busiest around lunchtime and in the early 
afternoon as workers take a break from their desks, however Costa has 
built its success on extending the trading day.

Last
 year it introduced a new breakfast range, including all-day-breakfast 
rolls and hot buttered toast, for workers who do not have time to eat 
before leaving home.

The 
firm has also extended its reach with thousands of Costa Express 
machines in hospitals, universities, supermarkets and offices.

Last night Whitbread chief executive Andy Harrison denied the high street had reached coffee shop saturation point.

He
 suggested that the chain’s outlets have become a destination point for 
socialising, much like Central Perk, the famous coffee shop in the US 
comedy series Friends.

‘The 
market is growing and we are benefiting from the move to online 
retailing where people are spending less time shopping and more time 
enjoying themselves in Costa,’ he said.

Globally,
 the chain sold 400million drinks in the year to February 27 with total 
takings up some 19.4 per cent to £1.2billion. Underlying operating 
profits grew by 21.9 per cent to £109.8million.

The
 chain overtook Starbucks in terms of the number of coffee shops on 
British streets in 2010 and its recent performance is in stark contrast 
to its US rival.

Costa UK 
sales rose by 16.5 per cent last year to £807.7million, while Starbucks 
suffered its first fall during 16 years of operating in Britain as it 
was hit by boycotts and criticism over the low levels of tax it was 
paying.

Success: Whitbread chief executive Andy Harrison said people in China have a taste for Western coffee shops

Accounts for its main UK subsidiary, Starbucks Coffee Company 
(UK), showed turnover fell in the year to the end of September 2013 to 
£399million from £413million the previous year.

The
 fall came on the back of the closure of some of its unprofitable 
outlets, however it plans to open 100 more Starbucks this year.

The
 firm has also moved to dampen the criticism of its tax arrangements by 
moving its European headquarters from the Netherlands to London with the
 result that it will pay more.

As
 well as Costa, the Whitbread group also owns the Premier Inn budget 
hotel chain, where there are also big expansion plans, along with the 
restaurant brands Brewers Fayre and Beefeater.

Caffe
 Nero plans to open 34 more British outlets this year, and Tesco has the
 financial muscle to expand its coffee shop chain Harris + Hoole into 
suburbs across the country.
