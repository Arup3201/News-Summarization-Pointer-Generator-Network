Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has criticised changes being made to Champions League seedings for next season.

UEFA is to implement a radical overhaul that will see the holders, alongside the league champions from the seven top-ranked nations, placed in pot one.

Teams are currently seeded according to performances in the Champions League and Europa League rather than domestic competitions.

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger does not agree with the changes being implemented by UEFA

The change has been agreed on the basis on 'sporting merit' and could mean some of the biggest and historically most successful clubs in Europe clashing as early as the group stages. It will also eliminate the possibility of teams from a small number of countries dominating the top seedings.

Wenger, speaking ahead of Tuesday night's Group D showdown against Anderlecht at the Emirates Stadium, believes the new method is misguided.

'It's not needed because it's a competition that works best in the world and is most admired. Everyone wants to watch it,' Wenger said.

'I was quite surprised that they've done that. We'll see how it works. I believe it will just make the seedings useless.

'Logic is not being respected. Logic for me when you play in Europe is results in Europe.

'I'm not really fighting it because it will just make the seeding less interesting. Group one will now have less significance.'

Arsenal are three points behind Group D leaders Borussia Dortmund in second place and need to beat Anderlecht for the second time in two weeks to keep snapping at the German club's heals.

This year's champions will go into pot one next season with league champions from Europe's best leagues

The Gunners have spluttered through the opening stage of the season despite the £35million arrival of Alexis Sanchez, and Wenger knows there is room for improvement.

'Our attitude and dedication have been fantastic, but on the efficiency front we can do better,' Wenger said.

'We have created many chances and our finishing has not always been at the expected level.

'We give very few chances away but those that we have given away are of quality, and that is what we want to do better.'
