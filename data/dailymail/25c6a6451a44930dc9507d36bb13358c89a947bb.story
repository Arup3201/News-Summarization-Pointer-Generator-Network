Cyclist Adam Jones was left to die by a callous driver who mowed him down and fled the scene

Police are hunting a driver who fled the scene after mowing down and leaving a 15-year-old cyclist to die in the road.

Adam Jones was crossing a junction in West Bromwich, West Midlands, shortly after 7.30pm on Thursday when he was run over by the Volkswagen Bora.

The teenager was thrown through the windscreen of the vehicle causing serious injuries. 

But instead of stopping to seek medical assistance, the callous driver abandoned his vehicle and fled the scene.

Paramedics arrived to the junction of Beacon View Road and Walsall Road, but the young cyclist had suffered 'extensive injuries' and was confirmed dead at the scene.

Friends and family paid tribute to Adam, from Wednesbury, West Midlands, who was known as 'Gadget' with dozens of flowers and balloons at the scene.

Zoe Harmon wrote on Twitter: 'R.I.P Adam Jones, you'll be sadly missed, Friar Park won't be the same without you!'  

Police have now released shocking images of the badly damaged Volkswagen Bora in a bid to try and trace the driver.

In the pictures, taken at the scene, the front end and bonnet of the blue car is crumpled and the front windscreen has also been completely ripped out.

Inspector Paul Bennett, from West Midlands Police, said the car was travelling from Stone Cross towards Walsall when it hit the teenager.

He said: 'This was a shocking collision which has cost a young man his life and we are determined to find the person responsible for his death.

'The driver of the vehicle would have known that Adam had suffered catastrophic injuries, yet he still ran away without seeking medical assistance for him.

'I am appealing to him directly to do the right thing and come forward.

'I would also like to hear from anyone who recognises the car and knows who uses it, possibly having seen it parked outside an address or worked on it in a garage, to help us trace the driver.'

A spokesperson for West Midlands Ambulance Service said: 'Crews attended a road traffic collision involving a car and cyclist.

'Sadly, despite the efforts of ambulance crews nothing could be done to save the cyclist involved. He was confirmed dead at the scene.'

Officers said the registered keeper of the car sold the vehicle several months ago and has been eliminated from police inquiries.

A 24-year-old man, who was arrested at the scene, has been released without charge after it became clear he was not connected to the collision. 

Anyone with information should contact the Collision Investigation Unit on 101 or alternatively information can be given anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 quoting log 1989 of 26 March.
