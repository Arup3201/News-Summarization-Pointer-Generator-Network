Michelle Snyder is leaving CMS after presiding over the failed Obamacare website launch

Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Chief Operating Officer Michelle Snyder is on her way out after 41 years working for the federal government, but she won't leave without absorbing some final slings and arrows from critics of the Affordable Care Act.

Rep. Darrell Issa, the hard-charging conservative Republican who chairs the House Oversight Committee, criticized Michelle Snyder on Monday for 'bypassing the recommendation of CMS' top security expert' before green-lighting the October 1 launch of healthcare.gov.

Those experts, Issa said in a statement, recommended a delay 'after independent testers raised concern about serious vulnerabilities from a lack of adequate security testing.'

'Americans seeking health insurance,' he added, 'are left to shoulder the risk of a website that's still an all-around work in progress because of the cult like commitment officials had to the arbitrary goal of launching on October 1.'

CMS administrator Marilyn Tavenner announced Snyder's retirement Monday, saying that he had planned to leave a year ago but stayed an extra 12 months at Tavenner's request to 'help me with the challenges facing CMS in 2013.'

The federal government's main Obamacare website was built at a cost that is now approaching $677 million, through contracts with technology companies that reported to Snyder.

As the chronically troubled website is re-worked and its near-comical rollout enters its salvage phase, that role will now fall to Snyder's deputy, Tim Love, who will take on her job on an 'acting' basis.

Healthcare.gov has been plagued with crashes, data security problems and a failure to handle large volumes of traffic -- and Snyder has attracted much of the blame

A former CMS official told The New York Times that Snyder was expected to depart following healthcare.gov's disastrous implementation.

'She
 had to go,' the official said. 'She was responsible for the 
implementation of Obamacare. She controlled all the resources to get it 
done. She was in charge of information technology. She controlled 
personnel and budget.'

Technically speaking, no one has been fired – or asked to resign – over Obamacare's flawed public introduction.

By
 contrast, President Obama asked for the resignation of the Internal 
Revenue Service's acting director in May after a controversy erupted 
over the agency's partisan use of the tax code to target politically 
conservative nonprofit organizations.

During an October 30 congressional 
hearing, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius blamed 
Snyder for the epidemic of website crashes that accompanied the rollout,
 but moments later insisted that she herself should bear responsibility.

In
 a heated exchange with Tennessee Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn, 
Sebelius named Snyder as the CMS official who was in charge of the 
website's building phase.

'Michelle Snyder is the one responsible for this debacle?' Blackburn demanded to know.

'Well, excuse me, congresswoman,' came Sebelius' answer. 'Michelle Snyder is not responsible for the debacle. Hold me accountable for the debacle. I'm responsible.'

In the following weeks, Sebelius and other Obama administration officials shifted the blame to contractors including CGI Federal, the highest-dollar recipient of taxpayer funds allocated to the project.

Snyder is the second official to step down from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a sub-agency of HHS, since Obamacare's rocky start.

CMS Chief Information Officer Tony Trenkle left in November to take a private sector job.

HHS released a report just weeks ago that blamed 'inadequate management oversight and coordination among technical teams' for the healthcare.gov debacle.

In response, Jeffrey Zients the 
management guru tapped to resolve the project's outstanding problems, 
told reporters in a conference call that he believed 'healthcare.gov was
 fixable if we made significant changes to the management approach.'

Those
 changes included naming an outside company – one of the same firms 
involved with the site's failed early construction – as its overall 
quarterback, or 'systems integrator,' removing that role from Snyder's 
office.

Rep. Darrell Issa slammed Snyder for enforcing a 'cult like' obsession with opening up healthcare.gov to the public when it was not yet ready for action

During a congressional hearing, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius named Snyder as the top official at the helm of the failed website project, but fell on a rhetorical grenade by insisting that she herself was most to blame

The website has functioned better in recent weeks, and HHS boasted over the weekend that 1.1 million Americans had enrolled in health plans through its federal-level insurance marketplace.

Fourteen states and the District of Columbia run their own exchanges, likely adding hundreds of thousands more to that total.

But Washington's own projections called for 3.3 million by year's end, putting the White House on a pace to reach just one-third of its overall goal of 7 million by March 31.

But the administration's latest statement provided no hint about how many – or how few – enrollees have paid premiums.

Additionally, there has been no word from insurers about how many of them will be covered on January 1. Among healthcare.gov's systemic problems is a back-end processing glitch that has garbled some records on their way to insurers and left others unsent entirely.
