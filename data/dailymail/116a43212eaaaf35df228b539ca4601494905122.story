A terminally-ill schoolboy who was awarded a 'dream ride' in a Porsche suffered two broken legs and bit off his tongue when the car collided with oncoming traffic.

Raphael Wittmann, 14, was placed in intensive care  after the high-powered sports car crashed in the outskirts of his home city of, Vienna, Austria, in May. He died two months later. 

His family claim the charity who organised the experience, Kinder Krebshlife, did not offer to help the youngster after the horrific crash, and as a result they are now demanding compensation.

Tragic: Terminal cancer sufferer Raphael Wittmann, 14, ended up in intensive care and died two months after the crash in the outskirts of his hometown, Vienna, Austria

Scene: The emergency services tend to the youngster next to the crushed Porsche at the crash site in Vienna 

The teenager was given intensive therapy at his home following his diagnoses 12 months ago, but it was not successful, and his parents were told he wasn't going to live.

His father, Franz, 47, became determined to make his final months memorable, so managed to arrange a holiday to the Spanish island of Tenerife.

But shortly before that, he was contacted by the children's cancer charity who invited Raphael for a drive in the high-performance car outside of Vienna.

But the event ended tragically within minutes of starting when the Porsche 986 crashed into oncoming traffic, leaving the teen in intensive care with horrific injuries for two months before he passed away.

The only acknowledgement  his family say he received from those involved in organising the event  was an iPhone from the driver who was at the wheel when Raphael died.

Treatment: Raphael was diagnosed with cancer last year. He underwent intensive radiotherapy at home but doctors said he was unlikely to live, meaning his parents wanted to make his last months memorable 

His father Franz believes the accident on May 17 this year robbed his son of the will to live. 

'After the hand that fate had dealt him, he just didn't have the strength to go on any longer' he said.

And although the matter might have ended with the youngster's death on July 5, his father is still angry at the way they were treated by the children's charity.

The family have now contacted lawyer Dr Astrid Wagner to take the charity to task. He said: 'I want justice for my dead boy. Not me.'

Dr Wagner said: 'It was a charity event but these things should be properly organised and that means that the should be insurance as well as anything else. But the children's charity claim they didn't organise it, but won't tell us who did.'

She said that as a result they had no option other than to take legal action against the charity. 

The head of the charity Karin Benedik, has denied any wrongdoing. She said: 'We tried to help this family, and our name is dragged through the mud as a result. We were not the organisers of this event, it was the Porsche forum.' 

Angry: Raphael's father Franz (left)contacted lawyer Astrid Wagner (right) to take legal action. They are now suing the charity
