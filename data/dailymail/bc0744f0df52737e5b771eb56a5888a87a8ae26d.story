If Derby County continue to perform like this, promotion to the Premier League seems inevitable. Steve McClaren’s side cemented their place at the top of the Championship by taking control from the off and playing some quicksilver stuff.

Two sumptuous goals from Jeff Hendrick and Jesse Lingard early on were the decisive moments, but their football could have produced more.

It got a little frayed in the second half, with McClaren demanding more from his team as a few passes went astray, but goalkeeper Lee Grant was not troubled.

MOTM: Hendrick 

The impression has been that Derby were stuttering slightly, needing a late penalty to beat Sheffield Wednesday last Saturday having drawn their previous two Championship games from behind and losing to Reading in the FA Cup.

But this victory over Charlton, in front of their owners flown over from North America, made it eight wins from their last 11 league matches.

‘The first-half was fantastic, but it is very difficult to keep that tempo,’ said McClaren. ‘There was a maturity about the performance. A good night’s work, we move on.

‘I hope we can keep it up. As I’ve always said, with ten games to go that’s when the season starts.’

His opposite number Guy Luzon, was unequivocal. ‘They are the best team in the league. They deserve to be in the Premier League,’ he said. ‘I am sure if they continue to play like this, to move the ball well, to press the opponent, they have the quality.’

Derby were at Charlton early and took the lead in the ninth minute. Will Hughes threaded a pass to Darren Bent, who turned provider by teeing up Hendrick for the simplest of finishes from two yards.

Bent has scored seven goals during this loan move from Aston Villa but his cross showed he can assist too.

Five minutes later Tom Ince sent a crisp shot just wide of the post, drawing mistaken cheers from some in the stands.

In the 17th minute it did become 2-0. Hendrick slipped a delightful pass to Lingard, who galloped onto the ball and struck an accurate first-time finish into the far corner.

It was the winger’s first goal on his first league start since joining on loan from Manchester United.

Hughes sent another shot narrowly wide at the end of a flowing move before Hendrick hit the crossbar from range on the stroke of half-time.

Derby’s ability in the transfer market under chief executive Sam Rush was evident, the front trio of Bent, Ince and Lingard all secured on loan during a busy winter window. Their quality glimmered.

George Thorne performed well in his second start in four days following seven months out with a serious knee injury, before McClaren withdrew him in the 71st minute.

Charlton boss Luzon made three changes to try to affect matters, with Chris Eagles again sent on. He could not repeat his scoring trick from the 3-0 win over Wigan though.

Johann Berg-Gunmundson had a free-kick in a threatening position but whipped it over the bar. That was as close as the visitors came.

Having gotten over a small wobble in that second period, Derby saw the game out comfortably as their supporters were able to sing about ‘Being top of the table’. The challenge is to make good on this promise and stay there.
