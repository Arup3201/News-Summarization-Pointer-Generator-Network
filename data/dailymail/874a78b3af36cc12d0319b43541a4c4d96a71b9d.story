A mother whose daughter was mauled to death by their pet dog has been forced to move home and change identity after receiving death threats.

Four-year-old Lexi Branson died in November last year when the dog 'suddenly turned' on her in the lounge of her home in Mountsorrel, Leicestershire while she was off school because she was poorly.

Her mother Jodi Hudson was forced to stab the animal in order to free her daughter as she was shaken 'like a rag doll' after the dog pounced.

The bulldog, which was a stray called Mulan, was adopted by the family two months before the incident.

Now the single mother has revealed she has had threats and hate mail on social media, leading her to move to a secret address and change her surname.

She also said that she hired security to protect her and her family during Lexi's funeral, which took place at the Holy Trinity Church in Barrow-upon-Soar in Leicestershire.

She told the Daily Mirror: 'As if losing my beautiful little girl isn't bad enough - people now want me dead too.

'Some are saying it was my fault for having a dangerous dog. It's so cruel and now I always look over my shoulder. I was scared for my life at the funeral.'

The 31-year-old also says she still has nightmares and is undergoing counselling while she tries to rebuild her life.

The dog came from Willow Tree Rehoming Centre and at the time Leicester City Council confirmed a dog warden took the dog off the streets and handed it into the kennels before Miss Hudson took it in.

Miss Hudson had been concerned at a poster of the dog which included a warning it was unsuitable for 'small children'.

Lexi was in the lounge of her home in Leicestershire, while she was off school poorly, when the dog attacked her

But when she asked about the sign she was allegedly told the dog would be fine if it wasn't 'allowed to jump up'.

It is understood that the rehoming centre has now closed.

The dog, thought to be between six and eight years-old, also died during the incident from stab wounds. 

At the time of her death, Lexi's family described her as 'our shining star in the sky' who 'will never be forgotten'.

In a statement her mother and grandmother Kerry Hudson said: 'Lexi was a bubbly, bright little girl.

'She fought for her life from the moment she was born as she was born 3 months prematurely, she’s been taken from us so tragically.

'She will be sadly missed, she will be our shining star in the sky and she we will never be forgotten.'

Her mother and grandmother are also planning a campaign to warn people about the dangers of some rescue dogs and are calling for better vetting procedures.

An inquest into her death is expected to take place later this year.
