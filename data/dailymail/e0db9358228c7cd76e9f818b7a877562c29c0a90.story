Candidate: Darrell Ackman, 43, seen here in a police mugshot, is currently on bail on a number of sex-related charges. He had been named as an Independent candidate in Canada's Fort Whyte by-elections

An alleged child pornographer - also accused of luring young girls to work in prostitution - is running for political office in Manitoba, Canada.  

Darrell Ackman, 43, who is currently on bail on a number of sex-related charges, had been named as an Independent candidate in the Fort Whyte by-elections.

And the announcement has caused one of his alleged victims, a 17-year-old girl, to suffer from panic attacks.

The girl’s outraged mother told the Toronto Sun how her daughter was scared to go outside after seeing 
Ackman’s photo in a local paper.

‘I'm
in tears here. I can't get over this. I think our government should 
look at things differently ... to let someone like that run?', she said.

Ackman is allowed to run for office 
because he has not been convicted of a serious offence in the last five 
years and is not in prison, Lisa Kingham, a spokeswoman from Elections 
Manitoba, said.

'There
is nothing that disqualifies Mr. Ackman from being nominated and 
running in the Fort Whyte by-election. Credibility doesn't fall within 
our mandate. It's eligibility that we look at. We don't have the mandate
to look at any other factors outside of that,' she told the MailOnline.

Ackman has submitted 
the names of more than 100 voters in Fort Whyte who support him, a 
requirement for all official candidates.

If
a person is convicted of a serious offense after being elected, and is 
sentenced to at least five years in prison, they would have to resign, 
Elections Manitoba confirmed.

Arrested: Ackman was arrested in July and charged with sexual assault and living off the avails of prostitution

Ackman first came to the attention of Winnipeg police after filming young women and uploading the videos onto YouTube under the name MrJetztv.

Ackman told CBC News that he will be 
running as his alter-ego MrJetztv, saying that he is focused on what 
Winnipeg is all about – NHL hockey.

He was suspected of making videos and putting them online to promote prostitution under the guise of escort agencies.

After a lengthy investigation, he was arrested in July and charged with sexual assault and living off the avails of prostitution. He also faces charges of sexual interference and making and distributing child pornography.

Ackman allegedly targeted four 14-year-old girls who are considered to be at-risk. According to court documents, police allege that Ackman sexually assaulted two of the girls for a year and a third girl for a short time in July 2012.

He is also believed to have involved them in street prostitution.

Police are also investigating allegations from another eight girls. The investigation targeting individuals who were preying on vulnerable, teenage runaways began in November 2011.

After working with several social service agencies, police were able to arrest Ackman, who is also wanted in Florida for prostitution charges dating back to 2010.

Although he is permitted to run for office, Ackman’s campaign is hampered by his bail conditions.

He is not allowed to possess a camera, a cellphone, or access the internet.

His bail conditions stipulate a 6pm-6am curfew, ban him from contacting his alleged victims or anyone under 18, as well as banning him from certain areas.
