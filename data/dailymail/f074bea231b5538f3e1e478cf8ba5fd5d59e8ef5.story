Sky Sports are running an ill-conceived promotional trailer for the start of the Football League season tonight that in no way reflects the diverse support amongst the 72 clubs.

The ad features supporters drawn from 23 clubs across all three divisions expressing their passion for their team. Yet remarkably, when inclusion is such an important factor at every level of football, it features only one black fan.

The blunder comes despite anti-discrimination being at the top of the football agenda and FA chairman Greg Dyke recently calling the FA council ‘overwhelmingly white in a world that isn’t’.

In their own promotional activities, football bodies are always mindful of displaying the sport’s hugely diverse following and a League spokesman said: ‘This was an unfortunate oversight that Sky have recognised.’

A Sky spokesman said: ‘We always try and represent the breadth of football fans and acknowledge we could have done better this time.’

It was a close run thing at Old Trafford between Channel 5 analyst Simon Hughes and busy England managing director Paul Downton over who spent more time on the playing area before the start of play in the Test for no seemingly obvious reason apart from being seen to be there.

Aussie irritant Shane Warne might have taken Mike Gatting’s wicket with the ball of the century at Old Trafford in 1993. 

But he had to be reminded by fellow Sky commentator Mike Atherton that the pitch had been turned around before the 2013 Ashes match in Manchester at which Warne was working for TV. 

Meanwhile it’s become very noticeable since Warne’s chat with Alastair Cook before the Lord’s Test that he has quietened down on his previous relentless criticism of the England captain.

lt has emerged former Southampton overlord Rupert Lowe might be interested in the vacant post of Premier League chairman. Certainly Lowe, responsible for setting up the Saints academy that has produced so many top-quality players — only for most of them to be subsequently sold off — knows how the Premier League works and wouldn’t be in the pocket of chief executive Richard Scudamore.

Gidney’s Jimmy gaffe

Lancashire’s rebel members, upset at being marginalised at Old Trafford, felt even more detached from the corporate-obsessed hierarchy when chief executive Daniel Gidney told them Burnley’s born and bred Jimmy Anderson had proved a great signing from another county. 

The upset at changes Lancashire have made can be gauged by membership free-falling from more than 14,000 to around 4,500. 

A major grievance is that the dressing-rooms have been located at the opposite end of the ground from the members’ pavilion, resulting in Ashwell Prince raising his bat to empty stands after scoring a career-best 257.

There is a desire among some sports governing bodies for flexibility in UK Sport’s zero tolerance towards funding any athlete who doesn’t show Olympic medal potential — especially for a team sport such as basketball. 

However that view isn’t shared by the high command of UK Sport, who remain steadfast there can be no going back if they want to accomplish their target of improving on doing better than London 2012 by bringing home 66 medals from Rio. 

Certainly Chris Spice, British swimming performance director, is confident enough about his gobbledegook ‘pathway performance indicators’ to award himself nine out of 10 for his own ‘analysis framework’.

Flexibility: There are calls from some sports for UK Sport to be lenient on their specific funding for Rio 2016

The torment goes on for former Leeds CEO David Haigh, who has been in prison in Dubai since May 18 following a dispute with former Leeds owners GFH Capital, with no charges laid against him nor any date set for a court hearing. 

To add to the Leeds debacle, colourful agent Pino Pagliari is demanding £1m from GFH for introducing them to owner Massimo Cellino.
