Quizaholic David St John even travelled to Australia to take part in an Ashes-style clash between UK and Australian quiz champions

We're about to watch David St John’s finest hour. He flicks on the DVD and there he is — all gleaming smile and big hair — flanked by a brace of matronly women.

He’s notching up the points so smartly on a quiz show called Jeopardy that his fellow contestants look mildly stunned.

David’s score is unfeasibly high. He seems to have acquired several thousand points. He carries off a (relatively modest) £500, but this is 1996; a gentler era, before TV quiz shows became ferociously competitive and offered bonanza prize money.

David is on a winning streak with Jeopardy. The following week he comes back and trounces the opposition again. Kerching! Another £500 drops into his lap.

‘Jeopardy was a quiz show with a difference,’ he says. ‘The host, Jonathan Ross’s brother Paul, read out the answer and you had to supply the question. I blasted through, knocking the reigning champion off her perch.’

David, 64, does not look like the archetypal quiz nerd. He has the aura of a Sixties pop star. But do not be deceived: his brain is a veritable compendium of trivia, and he has the fastest trigger finger since Wyatt Earp.

He is also, it emerged last week, Britain’s most prolific quiz show contestant, having made 28 appearances on TV game shows over the past 30 years.

The Weakest Link, Eggheads, No Win No Fee, Brainwave: these are just a sample of the shows on which he has competed. He has faced a panoply of star hosts from Bob Monkhouse (‘my comedy idol’) to Jeremy Beadle (‘very pleasant’), Gyles Brandreth (‘terrific!’) and Queen of Mean, Anne Robinson.

‘Luckily I have the hide of a rhino,’ says David, a comedian and entertainer. ‘Anne didn’t intimidate me one bit.

‘I’m used to performing — after all, it’s my day job — and I was expecting a bit of flak from her.

‘When I was voted off she said: “Oh, so David, you’re a comedian. That wasn’t very funny, was it?” I’d have liked a bit of banter with her, but I didn’t get the chance.’

His most recent appearance, broadcast last week, was on a show called Face The Clock, hosted by impressionist Rory Bremner.

It wasn’t all glamour, however. ‘The auditions for Face The Clock were in a freezing cold warehouse in Glasgow. You have to answer questions against the clock, but you’re not told when the time will run out. I lost by a split second, narrowly missing the £1,800 jackpot.’

David, alas, has endured an infuriating number of such near-misses. He has won a relatively modest £5,000 in prize money over the years, though when critics carp that this makes him more vanquished than victor, he points out that surmounting the hurdle of the audition is a triumph in itself.

He says his job helps him keep cool under fire. He works in clubs, pubs, on cruises and as an after- dinner speaker, and never gets stage fright. He also has  instant recall and the memory of  an elephant.

‘Most contestants are nervous, but I never am,’ he says. ‘There are auditions before every show and you have to come across as confident and knowledgeable.’

His top subject is Sixties pop music, and by golly, he’s good. Not only is his brain a compendium of every hit song of the decade, he also recalls bogglingly obscure facts.

‘I know Paul McCartney used a Vox T-60 bass amplifier and I can remember the registration numbers of The Beatles’ road managers’ cars.’ But how good is his general knowledge? I fire a couple of questions from the Daily Mail’s fiendish Masterquiz.

‘The Sea Cook was an early potential title for which novel of 1883?’ He answers correctly: Treasure Island.

‘Which instrumentalist might play a rimshot?’ He’s right again: a drummer.

The one subject that often stumps him is sport. ‘I don’t follow players, managers or teams. I don’t even know the star players of my local football team, Wolverhampton.’

David is self-taught — he was encouraged to leave his Southampton grammar school by teachers, who felt he was more interested in his pop band than studying.

Actually, they were only half-right. David did love music and performing. His mum, Joan, ‘a frivolous type who loved dancing’ and worked at the Pier Ballroom in Southampton, encouraged him.

‘She said to the manager: “Let my nipper sing.” So I went on the stage. I was ten. It was my first gig.’

But he also had a thirst for knowledge. ‘My dad, a carpenter, taught me to love books,’ he says. ‘I read encyclopaedias. I absorbed information like a sponge. And I enjoyed exams. But my teachers said I had the attention span of a gnat.’

He got into quiz shows by default when he auditioned for TV talent contests New Faces and Opportunity Knocks, and failed to get on.

Friends
 teased him for knowing a lot of useless information. ‘I thought: “I’ll 
show them. I’ll try a quiz show,” ’ he says. And he did.

Human encyclopedia: David has made 28 appearances on quiz shows in the past 30 years

His first appearance was in 1982 on Sale Of The Century. Hosted by the perennially popular Nicholas Parsons — David ranks him ‘the ultimate quiz show host’ because of his geniality, clarity of diction and the speed with which he rattled through questions. In its heyday, the show drew 20 million viewers.

David was on sparkling form. He even beat a fellow contestant, a vicar, on the buzzer with a Biblical question. What was it?

‘In the Garden of Eden, Eve was beguiled by what?’ he recalls. He leapt in so swiftly with the correct answer, a serpent, the vicar was left pink with embarrassment.

Four years later, he was invited to fly to Australia for a Sale Of The Century: The Ashes contest.

‘The two weeks in Melbourne was a prize in itself. I was spoiled rotten.’ Also picked for the GB team was the accomplished quizzer Daphne Fowler. ‘She sat by the pool studying lists,’ says David.

‘I don’t do any swotting. You can’t revise, because you never know what’s going to come up, do you?’

In the event, however, Daphne’s mugging up paid dividends. She beat him.

He encountered her again in 2008 on Eggheads. David still kicks himself over the question that lost him the contest; a tricky one on Hitchcock films.

‘People watch at home and say “Oh it’s easy. I could answer that”, but it’s a different ball game when you’re in the studio. It can be nerve-racking,’ he says.

David, who has two daughters and four grandchildren, lives in Cannock, Staffordshire with his Greek-born wife Maria, 59.

‘And no, I’ve never asked her to take my speeding points,’ he quips, referring to Chris Huhne and his Greek-born wife.

He is never short of a wisecrack, and would rather like to be a quiz show host himself — but not on one of the more cerebral shows.

He says there is a quiz show hierarchy, and University Challenge, Brain Of Britain and Mastermind are considered the elite. He auditioned for the latter, and didn’t get on. And it irks him when he encounters ‘big-headed’ sorts on shows.

Modest: Despite all his appearances, David has won only £5,000 over the years

‘Sometimes you come across university types who can be annoyingly boastful. You hear them listing the shows they’ve been on and it can intimidate the more nervous contestants,’ he says.

David has rarely been flummoxed, though last February in The Chase, he did have a moment of madness.

‘The question was “What do you call something that provides a steady income?” and, of course, the answer was a cash cow. But it was so easy I thought it was a trick question. I said cash camel. It was my first dumb answer.’

Even contestants with nerves of steel can become jibbering wrecks under pressure. Dumb answers are legion. I wonder if David has a favourite. ‘One contestant was asked to name a bird with a long neck. He said: “Naomi Campbell.” ’

During his three decades as a quizzer, he’s seen prize money shoot up and competition become fiercer. Getting onto a show like Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? is a costly, time-consuming exercise.

‘A friend spent £1,000 on phone calls before he qualified for the show. Then he didn’t get past the “fastest-finger” question — which is something silly such as “How many rivets are there in the Eiffel Tower?” He was quite miffed.’

David may be approaching his bus pass years, but his memory is still as sharp as a tack.

‘I haven’t had any senior moments yet,’ he says. ‘Besides, older people have had time to acquire a breadth of knowledge. Actually, they make the best quizzers — so perhaps my best years are yet to come.’
