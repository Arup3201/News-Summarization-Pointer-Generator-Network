Disgraced former New York governor Eliot Spitzer and his new girlfriend Lis Smith may have enjoyed  a relaxing family Christmas with her parents - but their cosy domesticity may soon be upset as she faces losing her job over their relationship.

Spitzer, 54, and his long-suffering wife Silda announced the end of their marriage on Christmas Eve - just days after photos emerged of Spitzer leaving his lover's Soho apartment.

Smith, 31, works as a spokesperson for mayor-elect Bill de Blasio and today a source denied that senior de Blasio aides have been interviewing replacements for a new communications director post.

The source told MailOnline: 'Lis was brought on as part of de 
Blasio's transition team and after that everything is to be determined. It's all in flux.'

Meet my boyfriend! Lis Smith took her new boyfriend Eliot Spitzer home to Bronxville, seen here, to meet her parents on Christmas Day

Smith was a key part of de Blasio’s successful mayoral team, but her tryst with Spitzer has done her career few favors.

Her future is uncertain after de Blasio said on Monday that he hadn’t decided whether to keep her on staff. He is reportedly unhappy at being blindsided when news of the affair broke, according to The New York Post.

There is no love lost between De Blasio and Spitzer. In August, not long after Spitzer had launched his bid be become controller, de  Blasio called him a ‘child of the elite’ and praised his rival Scott Stringer for his 'real integrity.' 

The coverage that the affair has attracted has already prompted Spitzer and his estranged wife, Silda, to announce late on Tuesday that their marriage is officially over.

Then on Christmas Day, Smith brought Spitzer to a party at her parents’ home in the Westchester village of Bronxville.

What cold? Smith was unfazed by the freezing cold weather. Highs in New York were in 20s on Christmas Day, but Spitzer's new squeeze braved the temperatures in a sleeveless, above the knee dress with no pantyhose or tights, much less a jacket.

On the trip to her mother's house in the suburbs, Smith let her dress do the talking: even though it was in the high 20s and low 30s, the chill didn't stop the 31-year-old from wearing a form-fitting black and tan sleeveless dress with bare legs and heels.

She wore large sunglasses and avoided any contact with the huddled collection of paparazzi outside of the house, but her new boyfriend took a much more relaxed approach to the issue.

The former governor wore khaki slacks and a navy sweater, and though he didn't say anything to the photographers, he gave them a quick wave before carrying presents into the home.

Rumors have long circulated that the Spitzers were no longer a happy couple but they waited until Christmas Eve to formally announce that they were ending their marriage. 

'We regret that our marital 
relationship has come to an end and we have agreed not to make any other
 public statement on this subject,' Spitzer family spokeswoman Lisa 
Linden told MailOnline in a terse statement released on Tuesday night.

It
 is unclear whether the couple is already divorced or whether they are 
planning to divorce. Ms Linden would not elaborate on the statement.

New York mayor-elect Bill de Blasio is in the process of hiring his communications manager, Smith was considered a front runner until details about her relationship with Spitzer emerged

Multiple
 reports indicate that the Spitzers have been living apart for some 
time. Mrs Spitzer was noticeably absent from the campaign trail 
this past 
year.

Since failing in his bid to become New
 York City Controller, Spitzer has decided to focus on his family's real
 estate business, just as he did when he lost office following the 
prostitution scandal in 2008.

Spitzer Enterprises just paid $88 million for a development site on Manhattan’s far West Side, reports the New York Daily News.

Smith joined de Blasio after 
Spitzer lost in the September primary. She has also served as the 
spokeswoman for the Mayor-elect during his transition.

She was believed to have been the frontrunner to become de Blasio's press secretary, but that was before news of her relationship emerged.

In 2012, she led the 'rapid response team' on President Obama's reelection campaign.

A
 former colleague of Smith's told MailOnline: 'Lis is one of the 
best political operatives in the country and her private dating life is 
not going to change any of that. Her accomplishments stand on their 
own.'

Spitzer has been named as a possible 
presidential candidate before a federal investigation revealed him as 
'Client 9' of Emporer's Club VIP, which ran $1,000-an-hour call girls.

He and his wife Silda stayed married for five and a half years after the 
scandal that cratered his meteoric political career.

The couple have three grown daughters together: Elyssa, 23, Sarabeth, 20, and Jenna, 18.

It's
 unknown whether the timing of Silda and Eliot's split has anything to 
do with the his relationship with Smith going public.

A
 friend of the new couple told MailOnline: 'The relationship began long 
after Eliot and his wife were living separately and it was not a secret 
to any of their friends or family.

'It's sad to see lots of outright lies
 about Lis and her career - Lis is an incredibly smart and dynamic woman
 who is at the top of her profession and is universally respected.

'She's dealing with this well and is looking forward to getting on with her career and life.'
