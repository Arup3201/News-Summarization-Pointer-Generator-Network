This is the moment a heartless thief was captured on camera after 'breaking in' to the home of an 80-year-old Parkinson's sufferer.

The woman is believed to have raided the pensioner's flat in South Norwood, London, several times over the past few weeks.

Scotland Yard detectives have now released CCTV footage showing the thief rummaging under cushions and around the room for cash and ornaments.

At one point, the brazen thief even pauses and stares into the camera lens, before continuing to ransack the property.

Neighbours have described the news of the vulnerable woman being targeted was 'sickening'.

Veronica Cadar, 23, said: 'It is really worrying. It's just appalling and sickening that such a vulnerable old lady could be targeted.

'People should look out for their neighbours more. No-one really cares who their neighbours are around here - everyone just looks out for themselves. It's very sad.'

Another neighbour described the burglaries as 'appalling'.

The neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: 'The police did come round and warn us about it last week.

'It does worry you and I feel awful for the old lady but I've not heard of many other burglaries around here so it makes you wonder if she was targeted.'

Police are urging anyone who recognises the suspect in the CCTV images to contact them.

Detective Constable Sheree Yates, from Croydon CID, said: 'Understandably the victim and her family are extremely upset and distressed about the ordeal.

'We are hopeful that somebody in the area might have seen something that could help us in our enquiries, or someone may recognise the person on the CCTV footage.'
