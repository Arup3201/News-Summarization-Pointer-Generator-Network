With his new bride by  his side, Heath Joynson looked delighted on his  wedding day.

His wife liked the photograph of them signing the marriage register so much that she posted it on Facebook for all their friends to see.

Unfortunately for Joynson – who was pocketing hundreds of pounds in benefits claiming he was single and living alone – the local council saw the picture too.

Guilty: Smiling as he signs the marriage register, this is the picture that got 'single' Heath Joynson caught by fraud investigators

The 45-year-old, who was receiving housing and council tax handouts, was found to be living with his wife, who had a job.

North Staffordshire Magistrates heard he had falsely claimed benefits totalling £1,241.

Joynson started claiming benefits from Stoke-on-Trent City Council in May 2010, but failed to notify it when he got married and started living with his wife. The council spotted the photograph on his wife’s Facebook page and invited him to three interviews, but he failed to attend.

Lionel Desa, prosecuting, said: ‘Her Facebook profile showed  them signing a marriage register. Her profile also showed she  was employed.’

Joynson pleaded guilty to failing to 
notify a change of circumstances affecting his entitlement to benefits 
between September 20, 2010, and January 9, 2011.

Cheat: Heath Joynson claimed more than £1000 which he was not entitled to after tricking his council into giving him housing and council tax benefit

He also admitted stealing £519.87 worth of goods from two supermarkets, failing to surrender to bail, and failing to attend a follow-up assessment following a test for the presence of a class A drug.

He was sentenced to a 12-month community order with supervision, a six-month drug rehabilitation requirement and 120 hours of unpaid work. A council spokesman said: ‘The offender tried a host of tricks and lies to avoid his responsibilities.

‘But our determined investigation team found pictures of his marriage ceremony on his wife’s Facebook page. Now he is paying the price of deception and we are sending out a strong message that we will piece together information from a range of sources and expose people who are defrauding the public purse.’

The court heard that Joynson’s wife left him five months ago because he started using heroin.

A man has been convicted of bigamy after his wife found a photograph on Facebook of him marrying another woman.

Thomas Hornsby, 37, of Sunderland, separated from his first wife in February 2011 after starting an affair with Joanne Henderson. He started divorce proceedings but they were never formalised and he wed his new lover in a ceremony on April 4 this year.

Sunderland magistrates sentenced him to eight weeks in prison, suspended for six months.
