Brett Favre, 44-year-old NFL hall of famer, has been speaking out about the dangers of sports related head injuries, and about his 'scary' memory lapses due to on field concussions.

Farve has been tackled 525 times, more than any other quarterback, and is starting to feel the negative effects on his brain.

In an interview with a Washington D.C. radio station in October, the ex Green Bay Packer said that he was unable to remember an entire summer of his daughter playing youth soccer.

Brett Farve has spoken publicaly about his frightening brain injuries and said he couldn't remember an entire summer in which his daughter played youth soccer

Head in the game: dangerous falls like this one in a game Farve played for the Minnesota Vikings may have contributed to the player's memory loss

'I got a pretty good memory, and I have a tendency like we all do to say, 'Where are my glasses?' and they're on your head. This was pretty shocking to me that I couldn't remember my daughter playing youth soccer, just one summer,' Favre told Sports Talk 570.

'That's a little bit scary to me. For the first time in 44 years, that put a little fear in me.'

Farve recently told Matt Lauer on Today News that if he were to have a son he may not want him playing the game. The interview with Lauer will air on Monday.

'I would be real leery of him playing football. In some respects , I'm almost glad I don't have a son because of the pressures he would face,' Farve told Lauer.

NBC reports that the NFL recently changed some rules to protect players heads from contact during and outside of games. The NFL also supported state laws dedicated to promoting safety in youth sports.

New rules aside, the NFL is still one of the most dangerous work environments and players who've had injuries from the game have become suicidal due to the injury's effects on the brain.

Ex-linebacker Junior Seau shot himself in the chest at his California home. An autopsy revealed that Seu suffered from a progressive degenerative brain disease called chronic encephalopathy (CTE).  

Players with brain injuries have reported depression, loss in memory, violent streaks, degenerative diseases, suicidal impulses, and various related health problems.

Many head injuries have long term effects starting just after or long after retirement from the game.

In fact, so many former NFL players have debilitating head injuries that many have sued the NFL for withholding information of the dangers of their injuries. The players claim that the NFL failed to tell them that their frightening symptoms were related to concussions.

Thousands of players who sued the NFL reached a settlement of $765 million.

Some players were so dedicated to preventing serious brain damage, that 30 former NFL players donated their brains to research.

Another NFL player who commit suicide with a gunshot to the chest, Dave Deurson, left a suicide note asking experts to study his brain.

Brian Mccarthy, a spokesman for the NFL issued a statement on Friday. 'For more than two decades, the NFL has been a leader in addressing the issue of head injuries in a serious way,' the statement said.

'Important steps have included major investments in independent medical research; improved medical protocols and benefits,as well as innovative partnerships with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health to accelerate progress,' McCarthy continued.

It's not a secret anymore: Many NFL players, including Farve, believe that the NFL withheld important information from them regarding their head injuries

'The players either retired or some of the few players ... are either killing themselves or self destructing. And you know, studies have proven that some of this is because of concussions,' Favre said in his radio interview.

NBC talked to Dr.Richard Figler, a doctor who practices orthopedic surgery at the Cleveland Clinic Sports Health Center. He was troubled by Farve's lapses in memory.

'It made me sad to hear him say that, but also … it raises the awareness, especially among high school football players who have sustained concussions but may not understand the symptoms, Figler said.

Figler also said that some students don't take concussions seriously at first, but the weeks later are getting Fs on their exams. This can cause even more injury over time. 'When you play with a brain injury, it probably means that there's a buildup of these injuries over time, and I think it's safe to say the effects that we're seeing now (with retired NFL players) – it’s a cause and effect,' Figler said.

undereducated coaches may allow a player to return to the game when he is not yet fully healed.This can cause problems later in life. 'The question is: How do we reduce the risk of the injury? And that's with education, the recognition of the symptoms, the athlete being smart enough to pull themselves off the field when they do have these symptoms, and making sure they're back to as normal as they can be before they go back to that activity,' continued Figler.

NBC reports that one team tried to convince Favre to continue playing but that he refused. Brett Favre turned down the offer and will continue coaching high school football in Mississippi.
