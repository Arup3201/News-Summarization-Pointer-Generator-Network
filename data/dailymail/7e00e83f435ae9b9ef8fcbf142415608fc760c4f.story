'Predator': Tyler Kost, 18, allegedly raped a 15-year-old girl but it was miscoded by a counselor

A Planned Parenthood counselor intentionally noted a rape by an allegedly prolific teen sexual predator as consensual to avoid the 'hassle' of reporting it, according to a police report.

The encounter allegedly involved Tyler Kost, 18, from San Tan Valley, Arizona, who has been charged with sexually assaulting 11 girls between October 2009 and April 2014 - although cops believe he may have attacked as many as 18.

One of his alleged victims was a 15-year-old girl who became pregnant following the assault and when she underwent an abortion through Planned Parenthood last December, her mother told a member of staff about the attack, FoxNews.com reported.

'The counselor intentionally miscoded the
 assault as a consensual encounter,' a police report states.

'The counselor 
told them that they did not want the hassle of having to report the 
assault to law enforcement as they were a mandatory reporter.'

Planned Parenthood Arizona told Fox they have contacted the Pinal County Sheriffâ€™s Department and said, if the allegations are true, it would be a 'serious violation' of its policies.

Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu added that he was 'troubled' by the allegations about Planned Parenthood and said they had been forwarded to state officials by the victim's mother.

'If this is true, they should absolutely be held accountable,' he said.

'Misconduct': A counselor at a Planned Parenthood in Arizona said they did not want the hassle of reporting the alleged assault to law enforcement, according to a police report (file picture)

Kost has been indicted on nearly 30 felony counts, including multiple counts of 
sexual assault with a minor, sexual abuse with a minor and sexual 
conduct with a minor. He also faces a count of child molestation.

Pinal
 County Attorney Lando Voyles said the victims in the crimes alleged in 
the indictment issued Wednesday ranged from 12 to 17 years old.

Voyles said the offenses - which involved victims that Kost dated or knew - occurred between October 2009 and April 2014 meaning that Kost
 was 13 when the first offense allegedly 
took place.

But Voyles plans to try him as an adult on all charges.

'In Arizona, once an individual turns 18, we don't have a choice,' Voyles said. '[State law] makes it fairly clear.'

Kost,
 a senior at Poston Butte High School, would face between 147 and nearly
 334 years in prison if convicted of all the charges in the indictment, 
the prosecutor said.

Pinal
 County sheriff's deputies arrested Kost two weeks ago, accusing him of 
being a serial sex predator who assaulted at least 18 students.

But Voyles said he could not comment on why the indictment accused Kost of crimes involving only 11 victims.

Arrested: He allegedly told one of the girls to kill herself - and she tried to take her life

Babeu said the baby-faced Kost threatened and harassed victims
 to such an extent that two fled the state, and one attempted suicide.

'This is a serious and serial sex offender and rapist,' Babeu said.

The
 investigation was initiated after the Sheriff's Office received a call 
March 25 from someone reporting that Kost had sexually abused and 
molested five teenage girls.

According
 to the indictment, none of the alleged sexual assaults occurred on a 
school campus.

Kost is accused of abusing the victims in his 
bedroom, in a parked car, a park and out in the desert.

In one case, Kost threatened, harassed
 and told one of the victims to kill herself, deputies said. The girl 
followed through and attempted suicide, but survived and was hospitalized.

While
 in the hospital, she allegedly got a message from Kost threatening 
that if she returned to school he would 'make her life a living hell.'

In another case, a girl became pregnant after she was allegedly raped by Kost and ended up getting an abortion, the station KPHO reported.

'He
 would assault these young female victims in their own bedrooms, in his 
bedroom, in the desert, at a community pool, at community parks,' Babeu 
said.

Detectives said because he looked young and innocent, many people didn't perceive him as a threat. His alleged victims included girls he had dated.

He was first jailed April 28 in 
connection with sex crimes against one victim and re-arrested three days
 later as sheriff's investigators tied additional victims to the case.

Kost is 
scheduled to be arraigned on May 16.
