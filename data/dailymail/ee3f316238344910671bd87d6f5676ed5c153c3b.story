Gary Cahill was the only absentee as England continued preparations for their opening Euro 2016 qualifier in Switzerland.

Cahill sat out Roy Hodgson's main session at St George's Park after aggravating a sore ankle during the win against Norway on Wednesday.

Hodgson expects Cahill to return to the group on Saturday and be fit to face the Swiss in Basel on Monday. The England boss has already lost two of his original 22-man squad to injuries.

Jack Colback returned to Newcastle having failed to recover from a kick on the ankle suffered against Crystal Palace, and Ben Foster has pulled out with a thumb problem.

Without Cahill, who opted to work out in the gym, it was Phil Jagielka who teamed up at centre half with Phil Jones in training as England looked sharp in a crossing and finishing drill.

'Love it, we're playing football,' Hodgson enthused. 'Very good indeed.' 

A far cry from Wednesday at Wembley when his team mustered only two shots on target, one of them a penalty scored by Wayne Rooney.

Three members of the England Under-20s squad were drafted in to help with the training session. Southampton midfielder Harrison Reed, Barnsley's Paul Digby and Exeter goalkeeper Christy Pym all started the session with Hodgson's side ahead of the Under-20s' match against Romania.
