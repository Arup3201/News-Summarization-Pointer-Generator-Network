Apple has fired a second senior manager following the debacle over the flop launch of its map application, which was savaged by furious users immediately after it launched in September.

The problematic map app was described by Apple at the time as 'the most beautiful, powerful mapping service ever.' However within hours CEO Tim Cook had issued an apology to customers and Apple was recommending customers use alternative apps while the company worked at improve their own dismal offering.

Richard Williamson had overseen the mapping team responsible for the unreliable app which is notorious for providing incorrect landmark searches and routes that get users lost.

Williamson has apparently been pushed out by Senior Vice President Eddy Cue, who took over last month as part of a management shakeup, reports Bloomberg.

Williamson is the second senior manager to be forced out over the disastrous map app, mobile-software chief Scott Forstall was ousted last month in a management overhaul.

said Forstall refused to sign a public apology after Apple's mapping 
product, which displaced the popular Google Maps on the iPhone and the 
iPad in September, contained embarrassing errors and drew fierce 
criticism.

Cue, a long-serving executive who runs online products, was also put in charge of maps and the Siri voice-recognition tool, bringing all of the company’s online services under one group.

Apple continues to seek advice from outside mapping-technology experts and digital maps provider TomTom to fix the faulty app.

Google is now preparing to unveil rival downloadable apps for Apple’s mobile devices. Prior to the launch of Apple Maps, Google's mapping application had been built into Apple’s iPhone since its introduction in 2007.

A team at Apple has been working to fix the mapping mistakes, focusing first on some of the most glaring problems.

The
new version of Apple’s iOS mobile software removed Google’s built-in 
maps app in favor of its own, which added new features such as 
turn-by-turn navigation and fly-over views of landscapes.

While Apple has enjoyed enormous success since Cook took the helm, recent stumbles including the Maps debacle and several earnings disappointments have underscored the long-term challenges the company faces in retaining its dominance in the smartphone and tablet markets.

In Google, Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft and Samsung Electronics, Apple faces an array of powerful competitors who are determined to own a piece of the exploding mobile-computing market.

'Competition is moving much faster to be more Apple-like,' said Tim Bajarin, president of technology research and consulting firm Creative Strategies.

Last month's executive changes hand substantially more responsibility to Sir Jonathan Ive, Apple's celebrated industrial design chief, who will now oversee both hardware and software design.

Craig Federighi, who oversees the OSX software that powers the Macintosh computers, has also taken charge of the iOS software.

Putting the mobile and personal 
computer software teams together under Federighi could improve 
operations within the company, particularly as the capabilities and 
features of smartphones and PCs increasingly converge, said analysts.

Ive, now responsible for design across
all products, has played a key role in Apple's success by imbuing its 
gadgets with a distinct look and feel.

BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis said
Ive could now help reinvigorate the look of Apple's software, which 
has been slow to evolve.

'If you have two different heads, you have two different fiefdoms,' he said.
