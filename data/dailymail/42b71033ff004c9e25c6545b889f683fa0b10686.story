Innocent: Khyra Ishaq, 7, was starved to death by her mother and stepfather - and now her surviving siblings are suing Birmingham City Council for breach of care

The five surviving siblings of Khyra Ishaq, who died after being starved to death by her mother and stepfather, are suing their local council for failing to protect them and save their sister's life.

The brothers and sisters have filed a claim against Birmingham City Council because they were told of their and Khyra's plight four months before she died.

All six children suffered horrific abuse at the hands of their mother Angela Gordon and her partner Junaid Abuhamza.

Gordon and Abuhamza admitted 
manslaughter of Khyra, who died aged seven after suffering starvation and abuse at 
their home in May 2008.

The pair also admitted five counts of child cruelty at Birmingham Crown Court in March 2010.

Khyra weighed just 2st 9lb, had 60 external injuries and lay dying 
with pneumonia and meningitis for two days while her mother was 
downstairs eating a takeaway with her partner.

Two of her siblings nearly died in hospital because of ‘re-feeding 
syndrome’, a phenomenon first seen in the Nazi concentration camps where
the shock of eating food causes the body to shut down.

Khyra and the other children were all starved as well as being subjected
to a harrowing punishment regime and a five-month detention, involving 
beatings with a cane.

If the children were caught taking any food the vile pair made them stand outside in the cold and forced them to over-eat until they threw up as part of a 'chilling' punishment regime.

As a result of the appalling abuse 
emaciated Khyra was reduced to scavenging bread from a neighbour’s bird 
table and lost 40 per cent of her body weight.

Lawyers acting for the five surviving children, who cannot be named for legal reasons, have filed a ‘substantial’ claim against the city for allegedly breaching duty of care to them.

Savage: Khyra Ishaq was whipped by Junaid Abuhamza with a bamboo cane whenever he thought that she had eaten too much

Hell: The family home in Handsworth, Birmingham, where Khyra was found starving to death by police in May 2008. The child was taken to hospital where she later died.

The claim alleges that it’s ‘very likely’ that Khyra’s death would have been prevented if the council had taken all of the children into care when teachers first raised the alarm.

Chilling: Khyra died weighing less that 3st and her remaining siblings believe she and they could have been saved from torment by the authorities

'We allege that you owed a duty of care to our clients and were in breach of that duty of care as a result of the negligent failure of Birmingham City Council’s social services department to remove them from the family home,' the claim letter says.

'It is the case of all the living claimants and the case brought on behalf of the estate of Khyra Ishaq that your social services department ought reasonably to have removed all six children from the family home and placed them in local authority care on a date no later than January 9, 2008, which creates an alleged breach period of four months and eight days.

'It would appear that the children’s teachers had done everything in their power to assist the children. But the efforts of the teachers to engage the social services department were ignored.

'Had the single visit they requested your social services department make to the family home been undertaken in December 2007, and factoring in the reasonable period of approximately three weeks to obtain a care order thereafter, the children would have been removed into local authority care no later than January 9, 2008. It is very likely that the death of Khyra Ishaq would have been prevented.'

The claim against the council relies on a liability report of a social work expert that was written in April 2012.

Their mother withdrew all of her children from the breakfast club in January 2007 and she wrote to the schools in March 2007, asking staff to not give second helpings to the children.

This well-equipped kitchen was as at the centre of the abuse, where children were starved or forced to over-eat

Well stocked: Despite there being plenty of food
to eat the children were starved in a campaign of abuse that cost Khyra
her life

In September 2007 she sent another letter to the schools which told staff to stop overfeeding the children and she added that they should not be given chocolate milk.

The letter said: 'Please do not give my son too much food. He does not know his limits. He is skinny simply because it is hereditary, not because he is starved at home, so please stop excessive feeding.'

Summing up at the end of a year-long case Justice Eleanor King said: 'Khyra was desperately ill, from when she had been beaten and made to stand for at least an hour in front of a cold fan.

'She died without medical treatment, without love, without comfort, or reassurance on a dirty mattress shared with her brothers and sisters in a room that she had scarcely left for five months.'

Abuser: Mother Angela Gordon serving food to children at a family wedding in 2007

Squalor: Khyra was forced to eat scraps on the floor of the family home's back yard or next door as she was desperate to eat

She said expert witnesses had testified that Khyra would have suffered a very painful and unpleasant death.

The children’s biological father Ishaq Abuzaire is also pursuing proceedings on behalf of himself for the psychological injuries he has suffered since Khyra’s death and the abuse of the surviving children.

Tony Hall, a partner at Birmingham-based Anthony Collins solicitors confirmed that Ishaq and the children were granted legal aid to pursue the substantial claims against the city.

Mr Hall said: 'We have sent a letter of claim on behalf of our clients. The council has until the end of January to respond by making admissions or denying the allegations.

'Any settlement that is approved for any of our clients will have to approved in court by a judge.'

A spokesman for Birmingham City Council said: 'We can confirm that we have received a letter of claim in this case.

'It would be inappropriate to comment on ongoing legal proceedings.'
