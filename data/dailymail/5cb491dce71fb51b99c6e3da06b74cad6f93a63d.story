How do you relocate 12,000 creatures including sharks, walruses and a giant octopus?

If power at the New York Aquarium in Coney Island is not restored soon, staff fear they may have to find out.

Superstorm Sandy sent a wall of water crashing over Brooklyn's boardwalk and into the aquarium on Monday.

Eerie: A black drum fish is reflected in flood water at Coney Island's New York Aquarium after the attraction was flooded during Superstorm Sandy

Critical situation: Unless power is restored soon staff may have to relocate some of the attraction's animals, including sharks, penguins and a giant octopus

The flooded attraction, which is 
currently closed, is now using a generator to power its two main exhibit
buildings - Glover's Reef and Conservation Hall. There are still areas 
that remain 'off line'.

Jim
Breheny, executive vice president of WCS Zoos and Aquarium and director
of the Bronx Zoo, said in a statement: 'We are facing a critical period
when we will have to decide if we are going to move some of our 
animals.

'We are 
still working around the clock to accomplish what we need to do. We 
continue to pump water out of the areas which house crucial operating 
systems.'

The decision on whether some animals will be temporarily relocated to other AZA aquariums will likely come on Saturday morning.

It's OK, he's fine: The aquarium reported that Mitik, its orphaned rescue walrus, had weathered the storm without incident and 'seemed interested and amused by all the activity around him'

its orphaned rescue walrus, had weathered the storm without incident 
and 'seemed interested and amused by all the activity around him'.

The
attraction also announced its adult walruses, sharks, penguins, sea 
turtles, and sea lions all survived the storm as did the aquarium's fish
collection despite power being lost when the storm hit.

Elsewhere in Coney Island, residents have begun searching for any food that can be salvaged from flooded stores.

Four days after Sandy made landfall, 
frustration is mounting over gas shortages, power outages and delays in 
getting aid to struggling communities.

Resourceful: Residents look inside black bags full of items to see if any food can be salvaged after the flooding

Search: People look for salvageable food among discarded items outside a flooded delicatessen in the Coney Island neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, after Superstorm Sandy
