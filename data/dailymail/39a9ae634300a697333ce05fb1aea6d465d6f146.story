Former Sligo Rovers manager Ian Baraclough has emerged as a shock contender for the vacant post at Motherwell.

Former Fir Park boss Terry Butcher is the frontrunner on a shortlist featuring caretaker Kenny Black, ex-Kilmarnock manager Kenny Shiels and Dutch pair Rob Maaskant and Mitchell van der Gaag who once played with the club.

But Baraclough has been invited for interview, too, after leading Sligo to their first league title for 35 years, taking the Irish side into the Champions League and lifting the FAI and Setanta Cups prior to his sacking in June.

The 44-year-old Englishman, who is also in the running for the vacant post at Mansfield Town, is currently scouting for Huddersfield Town while he awaits a return to management.

Motherwell have received 58 applications from potential replacements for Stuart McCall, who quit Fir Park last month, and are pressing ahead with appointing a manager despite lingering uncertainty over the club’s ownership.

Fans group the Well Society have been trying to raise enough money to buy former chairman John Boyle’s 70 per cent shareholding and hope to push the deal through with the help of retired businessman Les Hutchison.

Lanarkshire-born Hutchison, now based in Barbados, was once on the books of Albion Rovers as a goalkeeper but made his money in electrical engineering.

The Well Society ran into problems when their attempts to buy Boyle’s shareholding stalled at £500,000.

However, general manager Alan Burrows believes that an agreement is now close which will allowing the club to appoint a new manager.

He said: ‘I think we are in the final stages and are confident of a good outcome.’

An Argentine consortium has also been waiting in the wings, forging plans to appoint former Peru international and Newcastle United legend Nolberto Solano as manager should the Well Society fail to reach their target.
