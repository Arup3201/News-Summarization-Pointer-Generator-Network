Two men who helped gun down a man chatting to his estranged wife in a quiet residential street in a case of mistaken identity were each jailed for at least 28 years today.

Michael Ofori, 35, fell victim to a 'drive-by' shooting as he sat in his Mercedes. 

Sahid Sule and Nicholas Allon-McVytie, both 23, are thought to have intended to kill rival gangster Perry Walters, 24, after a spate of tit-for-tat shootings.

Walters was lured to Oslac Road in Catford, southeast London, on the premise of a drug deal shortly after midnight on June 23 last year.

Walters and Mr Ofori turned up in the same road within two minutes of each other, but the killers wrongly picked out Mr Ofori, a cousin of former England rugby international Paul Sackey, as he chatted while sitting in his parked Mercedes.

He was shot twice at close range, one of the bullets passing through his brain, and was pronounced dead shortly after arriving at hospital.

His wife managed to escape without injury.

Allon-McVytie, a former Lewisham College student and father-of-two, drove the gunman to the scene in his white van and slowly passed Mr Ofori's car as they tried to identify their target.

He then dropped off the killer and waited nearby, before speeding from the scene once the murder was carried out.

Sule co-ordinated the shooting via his mobile, including a key six-minute call to Allon-McVytie, and was linked to the revolver which was found three months later, fully-loaded, in a car he had registered in a false name and address.

Sule, who graduated from Roehampton University with a marketing degree, was found guilty by a majority of 10 to two on Wednesday of this week.

Both men were jailed for life with a minimum term of 28 years.

Judge Peter Thornton QC said: 'Your actions have brutally taken the life of a man who was loved by his friends and relatives.

'You have deprived a young daughter of her father.

'This was a co-ordinated, planned execution in which a number of people played a part.'

England rugby player Paul Sackey was a cousin of the victim

He said Allon-McVytie as getaway driver 'knew full well the purpose and intention of the gunman'.

'You were a knowing, willing participant in this execution. You were a key link in the chain of communication,' he said.

Following his death, Mr Sackey, 31, who has 22 caps for England and played in the 2007 Rugby World Cup, said he was 'really close' to his cousin. 

'He used to come to all my matches with Wasps and he had already booked flights to come out here and watch me play my first game for Toulon,' he said.

'He helped me pack before I left and I saw him the night before I moved to France, at my brother's place.

The court heard Mr Ofori's daughter was receiving therapy from a counsellor and his elderly and frail mother 'cannot come to terms with the cold-blooded murder of her son'.

A third man Kraig Isaacs, 21, was cleared of involvement.Two others Nathaniel Valton, 22, the alleged hitman, and Jules Brown, 25, now face a retrial after the jury failed to reach verdicts.Allon-McVytie, of (28) Deptford, southeast London; and Sule, of no fixed address; were convicted of murder.Valton, from Deptford; and Brown, of Upton Park, east London; are set to return to court next Friday, October 28, when the prosecution will decide whether to proceed with a retrial.

Isaacs, also from south London; was cleared of murder.
