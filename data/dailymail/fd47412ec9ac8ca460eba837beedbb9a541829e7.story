The young son of the world's seventh richest man was today under investigation after he was involved in a fatal collision in his father's £750,000 supercar.

Brazilian Thor Batista's father is businessman Eike Batista who has a fortune of more than $30 billion.

Thor, 20, was driving his father's prized Mercedes McLaren SLR on Saturday night when he was involved in a collision with a cyclist.

Wanderson Pereira dos Santos, 30, was
crossing the road on his bike on the Washington Luiz highway 30 miles 
from Rio de Janeiro when he was hit.

The
construction worker died at the scene following the smash, which left 
the 207mph Mercedes with a smashed windscreen and damaged bonnet.

Thor,
who suffered cuts and bruises in the crash, passed a breath test at the
scene and was questioned by police but not arrested.

However, officers investigating the tragedy have asked Thor to appear in court on Thursday to testify.

Eike
Batista, 55, who keeps his car in his lounge, revealed his regret at 
the man's death but stressed it was an accident and his son wasn't at 
fault.

He tweeted: 'Unfortunately there was a fatal accident. However, Thor was not reckless.

'My sympathy to the family and my commitment that all necessary assistance will be provided.'

The
Brazilian businessman is currently the world's seventh richest man and 
he vows to overtake Mexican telecoms magnate Carlos Slim as number one.

He is known as a flamboyant 
billionaire thanks to his time as a powerboat champion and former 
marriage to stunning Playboy model Luma de Oliveira.

The
self-made billionaire's company, EBX Group, is a huge conglomerate 
dealing with oil and gas, mining, construction and entertainment and has
assets of $1.5 trillion.

The
55-year-old has made his fortune from scratch in just 30 years and said
by 2015 he will be making a staggering $10billion per year.

This, he claimed, would propel him 
clearly in front of Slim's $68.5billion, Microsoft honcho Bill Gates's 
$62.4billion and Berkshire Hathaway Warren Buffett's $43.8billion.

EBX said it was 'deeply sorry' for the accident.
