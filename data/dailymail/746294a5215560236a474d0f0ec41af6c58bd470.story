He has rarely missed an opportunity to tease his older brother about his hair loss.

Now Prince Harry may find himself  the butt of jokes about baldness as pictures reveal he is rapidly shedding his ginger hair.

Experts who studied photographs taken of him during his recent trip to America concluded that Harry appears to have genetic male pattern baldness and predicted he will shed much of his hair before he turns 50.

Tease: Prince Harry enjoys joking about brother William's hair loss

However, it’s not all bad news for the 28-year-old party lover.

He is still doing better in the scalp
stakes than his brother William who is two years older and is expected 
to be completely bald before he is 40.

Jonny Harris, a hair-loss expert and 
managing director of the Belgravia Centre hair clinic, said Harry 
appears to have dihydro-testosterone, a type of testosterone that causes
baldness on the head while encouraging the growth of body hair.

Mr Harris said: ‘Harry may have very 
thin hair by the time he is 50. Prince William will be bald by the time 
he is 40, perhaps even by his mid-thirties.

Harry is known to make fun of his brother’s hair loss, once joking William was ‘already bald aged 12’.

And when the first portrait featuring
both princes was unveiled in 2010 he was convinced his elder brother 
‘got given more hair’.

The brothers appear to have inherited their hair loss from their father Prince Charles, 64.

He started to lose his hair in his 
late thirties, but his brother Prince Edward was, like William, 
developing a bald patch in his mid-twenties.

Prince Andrew, in contrast, still has a thick head of hair at the age of 53.

Mother's side: Harry takes more after his mother Princess Diana than William so is likely to keep his hair for longer

On Harry’s mother’s side of the family, baldness has again been unpredictable.

Earl Spencer, Princess Diana’s 
brother and Harry’s uncle, has a full head of hair, but the prince’s 
maternal grandfather, the 8th Earl Spencer, lost his hair in middle age.

Nadeem Uddin Khan, director of the 
Harley Street Hair Clinic, which carried out a hair transplant on Wayne 
Rooney, warned Prince Harry to ‘party as much as he wants because it 
will all catch up with him’.

Trichologists who studied images of Harry, 28, from his recent trip to the United States said he is thinning from the crown.

While around 70 per cent of hair loss is thought to be down to genetics, experts say there is an element of 'luck of the draw'.

Dr Asim Shahmalak, owner of Crown Clinic in Harley Street, told the newspaper: 'In
the royal family, unfortunately, it is such a strong genetic link with 
Prince Philip, Prince Charles and Prince William - Prince Harry is now 
following suit.'

But Harry's hair loss will be tempered by the genes he inherited from his mother, Princess Diana.

'Harry will lose his hair in the 
future, but Harry's genetic pattern is more on his mother's side so he 
has got a little bit more time,' Nadeem Uddin Khan, director of the Harley Street Hair Clinic said.
