This is the dramatic moment an eagle swooped down and caught a startled duckling for dinner - before bending over to look its poor prey right in the eye.

The bald eagle plucked the ruddy duck from the water and was carrying the bird back to a nest with its feet when it turned to take a look.

The extraordinary moment was caught on camera by Phil Lanoue, who lives near Murrells Inlet in Huntington Beach State Park, South Carolina.

The 60-year-old said: 'I saw the eagle swoop down and hit the water. 

'It sat there for a few seconds and I knew it was trying to get something secured in its talons.

'Suddenly the eagle burst up out of the water with a freshly caught duckling. I think the unfortunate victim was a ruddy duck.

'The eagle flew off towards the nest with an evening meal for its babies.

'I just couldn't believe it when the eagle looked right back at the duck and stared into its eyes as the poor little guy was being carried away.' 

The bald eagle is the only eagle unique to North America. 

They generally eat dead or drying fish, mice, snakes, rabbits and frogs.
