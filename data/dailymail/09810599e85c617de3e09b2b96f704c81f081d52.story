Once a Soviet base where the Red Army kept a stockpile of nuclear weapons, Little Moscow now lies in ruins and looks like a set for a post-apocalyptic film.

Wrecked furniture and rusty military equipment can be found strewn throughout the abandoned barracks near the village of Nagyvazsony in central Hungary.

A large painting of a red flag covered with the faces of communist icons Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and Vladimir Lenin, still adorns one of the walls at the base.

It was abandoned by the Soviets in March 1990, shortly before Hungary's first post-communist elections. 

The former base, which covered 89 acres, was protected by three lines of fences, barbed wire and numerous checkpoints and gates.

Nuclear warheads would have been stored on the northern side of the base, in a pair of bunkers protected by doors weighing more than six tonnes.

The military base, nicknamed 'Little Moscow' by locals, was one of four nuclear storage facilities in the whole country
