A judge cut the sentence of an illegal immigrant and drug dealer yesterday to help him escape deportation. 

Vincent
 Miller was kicked out of the UK twice but managed to return and stay for more than a decade by stealing the identities of British citizens.

Yet
 when the 33-year-old was sentenced, the judge said sending him home to 
Jamaica would be ‘devastating’ for his three children.

Judge Farook Ahmed made his decision on Miller's case during proceedings at Inner London Crown Court yesterday, claiming if he was to be deported it would be 'devastating' for his children

Incredibly,
 he deliberately shortened the sentence Miller would have received from 
a year to 11 months. Criminals given 12 months face automatic 
deportation proceedings.

Recorder
 Farook Ahmed told Miller: ‘The sentence I have had in mind was 12 
months, but it seems to me that it isn’t necessary for me to pass a 
sentence of 12 months because a sentence of 11 months will have the same
 effect, and it would take away 
the automatic triggering of deportation. I have taken into account that 
if you were to be deported it is bound to have a devastating effect on 
your three children, who I’m told are lawfully here in the UK.’

The judge’s decision provoked a fierce backlash.

Sir
 Andrew Green, chairman of the pressure group Migrationwatch, said: 
‘This raises serious questions about the attitude of the judiciary 
towards the whole question of removing from Britain those who no longer 
have a right to be here.

‘To shorten the sentence of a criminal so as to allow him to stay simply beggars belief.’ 

Tory
 MP Dominic Raab said: ‘The sentence should be tailored to fit the 
crime, not avoid Parliament’s rules on deportation which are there to 
protect the public.’

Stolen identity: Vincent Miller was able to apply for a passport using somebody else's name. This allowed him to stay in the UK for ten years

The case follows a string of outrages where the Human Rights Act has blocked deportation on family grounds.

Criminals have been permitted to stay even where they do not have children or a wife, but only a girlfriend.

Miller arrived in Britain at Christmas in 2000 when he was given permission to stay for only four days. 

He
 did not return home and was arrested and deported in February 2001 only
 to return that Easter under a stolen identity. Within two years he was 
deported for supplying class A drugs.

From
 abroad he successfully applied for a new passport in the name of 
another man, Joseph Roche, who had no idea his identity had been stolen.
 That second identity crime allowed him to obtain a driving licence and 
start work as a barber. 

As a result of his fraud, his wife and their three children, aged two, four and six, were able to claim UK citizenship.

His
 crimes were uncovered only when the real Mr Roche applied for a 
replacement driving licence, and DVLA officials realised two people were
 claiming to be the same man.

Miller, of Herne Hill in South East 
London, was arrested on July 5 and claimed he had given up Mr Roche’s 
identity some time earlier.

He later pleaded guilty to possessing another person’s identity 
document, three counts of conspiring to obtain property by deception and
 three counts of dishonestly making a false representation.

Anyone sentenced to more than a year in prison is automatically considered for deportation by the UK Border Agency. 

But
 the judge at Inner London Crown Court said he would reduce the intended
 sentence to allow Miller to stay in the country and look after his 
children.

'Beyond belief': Sir Andrew Green, left, slammed the judge's decision, while Dominic Raab said that sentences should fit crimes, not the deportation rules

Judge Ahmed told
 him: ‘You subverted immigration rules and you were able to construct a 
life in the UK based on your deception. 

‘I
 have taken into account that if you were to be deported it is bound to 
have a devastating effect on your three children, who I’m told are 
lawfully here in the UK.

‘At
 least one other person benefited from your conduct, and that is I’m 
told your former wife,’ said the judge. ‘She was able to become a UK 
national as a result of your assumption of Mr Roche’s identity.’ 

The
 judge said it was a significant aggravating factor that he had made a 
‘wholesale assumption’ of Mr Roche’s identity, who was himself then 
suspected of being a criminal. ‘He is a real person and is entirely 
innocent,’ he said.

The 
Home Office insisted it would still seek to deport Miller at the end of 
his sentence. However, the Jamaican will be entitled to use Article 8 of
 the Human Rights Act – the right to a private and family life – to 
attempt to stay in the country. 

Figures obtained by the Daily Mail show nearly 400 foreign criminals escaped deportation last year by using Article 8.

A
 UK Border Agency spokesman said: ‘We will seek to remove this 
individual at the end of his sentence. If someone has no right to be in 
this country, and does not leave voluntarily, we will take action to 
enforce their removal.’
