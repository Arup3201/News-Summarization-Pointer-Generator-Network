Crisis-hit Serie A club Parma have suffered another blow with the arrest of the club’s new owner and president Giampietro Manenti.

Italy’s financial police said Manenti was accused of investing illicit money and say he was one of 22 people arrested on Wednesday.

According to La Gazzetta dello Sport, Manenti is under investigation for various acts of financial irregularity including money laundering and fraud.

Manenti took over as Parma’s new owner and president last month, agreeing to pay off the club’s debts, which are estimated at nearly 100 million euros (£72.4m).

Players haven’t been paid in months, however, and a bankruptcy hearing has been set for Thursday.

Parma captain Alessandro Lucarelli said: ‘I hope sooner or later this all ends because honestly we can’t take any more.’

Manenti became the third owner of Parma this season after purchasing the club for a nominal sum from a Russian-Cypriot group in February.
