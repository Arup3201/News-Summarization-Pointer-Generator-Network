Support for British military action against ISIS has risen sharply in the last five months, as the government comes under pressure to catch Jihadi John.

David Cameron has vowed to give security and defence chiefs everything they need ‘to find these people and put them out of action’ after the ISIS killer was unmasked as former London student Mohammed Emwazi.

Backing for air strikes against ISIS has risen by 11 points to 63 per cent since September, while support for boots on the ground has grown from a quarter to a third.

New polling shows support for the RAF taking part in airstrikes has risen from 52 per cent in September last year to 63 per cent, according to a YouGov survey for The Times

The idea of British and American ground forces being sent into Iraq to take on ISIS is now backed by 32 per cent, up from 24 per cent September

MPs voted in September by 524 to 43 to back air strikes against ISIS in Iraq, with six RAF Tornados joining war planes from the US, France and Arab nations in military intervention.

But Britain is not involved in Syria, after MPs voted against action against the Assad regime in the country a year earlier.

New polling shows support for the RAF taking part in airstrikes has risen from 52 per cent in September last year to 63 per cent, according to a YouGov survey for The Times.

Eight in 10 Tory voters back airstrikes, compared to just over six in 10 Labour backers.

Some 73 per cent of Ukip supporters and 62 per cent of Lib Dems support airstrikes, while just 40 per cent of Green party supporters back the idea.

There is also growing support for ground troops to be sent it, although more people are still opposed to the idea.

The idea of British and American ground forces being sent into Iraq to take on ISIS is now backed by 32 per cent, up from 24 per cent September. However, ground troops are still opposed by 45 per cent.

David Cameron has insisted he will back the services in their efforts to take on ISIS, but some believe that will only be possible with the use of ground troops in Iraq and Syria

However, Tories are split 41 to 41 for and against ground troops. Among Lib Dems – who opposed the Iraq war - only 16 per cent are in favour, with 60 per cent opposed.

The killer known as Jihadi John has appeared in ISIS propaganda videos beheading hostages, including Britons, since last summer.

The naming of terrorist as Emwazi has put renewed pressure on the security services, after it emerged he had been pinpointed as a potential terrorist by the British authorities but was nonetheless able to travel to Syria in 2013 and join ISIS.

Mr Cameron has insisted he will back the services in their efforts to take on ISIS, but some believe that will only be possible with the use of ground troops in Iraq and Syria.

Speaking on Friday, the Prime Minister said: ‘I'm not going to talk about specific individuals and specific cases. But… when there are people anywhere in the world who commit appalling and heinous crimes against British citizens, we will do everything we can with the police, with the security services, with all that we have at our disposal to find these people and put them out of action.’

He defended the security services, insisting ‘they are incredibly impressive, hard-working, dedicated, courageous and effective at protecting our country’.
