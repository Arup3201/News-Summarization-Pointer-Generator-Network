Hamilton will begin his quest for his first win in Monte Carlo since 2008 in qualifying later on Saturday.

Hamilton leads Nico Rosberg in the championship by three points and will look to secure his first pole in Monaco later on Saturday.

'In 2009 I had the chance, but crashed. I
 had to be on such a limit that day it was a risk, too much of a risk in
 many ways, and I made a mistake,' said Hamilton.

'After that I've just not had a car to be on pole...although last year I did, but I wasn't quick enough.

'This year I know I've the car, and this year I don't have an excuse. Let's see how that then works out for me.'
