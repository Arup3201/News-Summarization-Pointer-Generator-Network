Luis Suarez and Barcelona are both confident that the Court of Arbitration will overturn part of his ban at his appeal verdict on Thursday, with Mundo Deportivo expecting the striker to be allowed to train with the club.

The paper labels it 'The Day of Suarez' with CAS giving their verdict for the sanctions at 2pm. They claim that Barca are confident that at least part of the appeal will be overturned because he must have 'the right to work and train'.

Sport, meanwhile, believes Barca have turned their search to Brazil as they target a new right-back.

Douglas from Sao Paulo and Leo of Flamengo are 'alternatives' that can move the club in the right direction. They also claim there is 'hope' for Suarez with his appeal.

Madrid-based Marca do not refer to Suarez on their front page, but instead they lead on the 'waterfall of praise' for Toni Kroos' performance in Real Madrid's 2-0 UEFA Super Cup victory over Sevilla in Cardiff.

In Italy, the big news is that former Juventus coach Antonio Conte is believed to be close to taking the national job on a contract worth £1.4million a year after the National Assembly provided money for the deal to be completed.

Both La Gazetta dello Sport and Corrire dello Sport claim he could officially sign as early as Saturday.

Tuttosport, on the other hand, claim that Andrea Pirlo has made up with Massimiliano Allegri at Juve. The pair famously fell out while at AC Milan together but it is claimed they have now put their differences behind them and have even shared some 'laughter'.
