Jobseekers must commute for up to three hours a day to work or risk losing their benefits.

Tough new rules this spring will also force them to accept any job that pays the minimum wage.

They will be expected to take jobs up to one-and-a-half hours away from home, and job offers will have to be taken up immediately, not deferred.

Must commute: Jobseekers will have to travel for up to three hours a day to work or risk losing their benefits under new rules to come into force in April

The rules will come into force with Universal Credit in April.

All claimants will have to sign a commitment with a Jobcentre adviser setting out their responsibility to find work.

Those who fail to comply risk losing their benefits.

Lord Freud, the Minister for Welfare Reform said it was an 'incentive' for people to work in return for jobseekers' effort 'to do all they can to get into work'

Each person’s commitments will be different, but ministers have made the rule on travelling time a standard for all.

Lord Freud, the Minister for Welfare Reform, said: ‘Universal Credit will create an incentive for people to work.

'In return, we expect claimants to do all they can to get into work.

‘Jobseekers who fail to carry out agreed tasks without good reason risk their benefits being docked.’ 

Claimants could forfeit as much as £10.20 a day for three years.

A typical contract might require 40 hours’ work a week and a pledge to report ‘at any time’.

Meanwhile, a Commons committee has accused the government’s troubled back-to-work programme of wasting £5billion.
