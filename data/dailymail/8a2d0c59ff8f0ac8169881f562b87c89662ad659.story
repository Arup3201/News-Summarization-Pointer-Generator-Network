Police interviewing Gerry Adams have new evidence from a convicted IRA terrorist that may name the Sinn Fein president as the person who ordered the execution of Jean McConville, it was revealed today.

A video interview of Old Bailey bomber Delours Price carried out shortly before her death last year is said to name members of the squad who abducted and murdered the mother of ten in 1972.

Until today it was believed the only evidence in the hands of the police is the ‘Tapes from Beyond the Grave’ – explosive 2001 interviews with former IRA terrorists revealing notorious crimes.

Damning: Police have a video of Old Bailey bomber Dolours Price giving a secret interview on the execution of Jean McConville, where she may have named Gerry Adams, right in 1971, as the man who ordered it

Interview: Gerry Adams remained in police custody here in Co Antrim, where he has been in custody since Wednesday

The audio interviews, recorded for a history project in the United States - known as the Boston College tapes - were granted only under strict condition that they were not released until after the deaths of all concerned.

But after a fierce legal battle, the 
secret interviews were passed to the police in Northern Ireland – and 
the bombshell revelations contained on the tapes are thought to be a key
 factor behind the dramatic arrest and questioning of Gerry Adams at a 
police station in Antrim yesterday.

They contain evidence about how Jean McConville was dragged screaming out of her west Belfast home in front of her children by IRA members who then executed her and buried her on a beach in 1972.

Her body was found 31 years later but none of the 12-strong gang who abducted and killed her have ever been brought to justice.

Today it was reported the Police Service of Northern Ireland have a 'newer' video with Price, which goes into further detail into how Mrs McConville was taken from her home, driven into the Republic of Ireland and shot in the back of the head.

Dolours Price was the first woman to 
become a member of an IRA active service unit and the leader of the 
terror cell which bombed the Old Bailey in 1973.

Price,
 who died last year, recounted how she was chosen to be part of a small 
select unit within the three battalions that made up the Belfast 
Brigade.

The group of eight hand-picked volunteers, labelled ‘the 
Unknowns’, were responsible for ‘special operations, including internal 
investigations to weed out informers’.

She told Boston academics: ‘The
 hardest thing I ever did was drive those people away, the Disappeared.

‘I never knew for sure their ultimate end, I was simply 
told by Gerry Adams to take the people away, a couple of lads or 
whatever.

'It was part of my job within the “Unknowns” to take them 
across the border to hand them over to others. I don’t even remember 
some of the names, isn’t that terrible?’

operatives have linked the Sinn Fein leader (right) to the murder of

executed and secretly buried in December 1972

Price’s interview continued: ‘I drove away Jean McConville, a very, very unpleasant woman.

‘I
 know I shouldn’t speak ill of the dead and I don’t think she deserved 
to die and, at the time, I didn’t know she had children.

‘I
 had a call one night and Adams was in a house down the Falls Road and 
she’d (McConville) been arrested by Cumann na mBan (a female wing of the
 IRA) women and held for a couple of days. She got into my car and as 
far as she was concerned she was being taken away by the Legion of Mary 
to a place of safety.

‘It
 was unfortunate for her and it was unfortunate for me as well because 
she was a foul-mouthed woman who cursed and swore a lot all the way down
 to the border. She went on and on about “them provies, they wouldn’t 
have the balls to shoot me... I don’t care what I did”. I was saying to 
myself, “please don’t say any more”, but she went on and on – she 
convicted herself out of her own mouth. It wasn’t my decision to 
disappear her, thank God.

‘You
 don’t deserve to die if you are an unpleasant person, as she was, but 
you do deserve to die if you are an informer, I do believe that. 
Particularly in a war, that is the Republican way.’

Removing her body: The mother of ten's body is removed from an area near Templetown beach in County Louth

Researchers
 at Boston College last year lost a Supreme Court challenge in the US 
when they tried to block the release of the 84 tapes after the PSNI 
launched a high-profile legal challenge. So far, 11 have been handed 
over relating to the McConville case.

Boston College said yesterday: 'We
 are not privy to the actions of British law enforcement and have had no
 involvement in the matter since the U.S. court issued the order to 
remand portions of the archived interviews last year'.

At least 
two high-profile IRA operatives have linked the Sinn Fein leader to the 
murder of Jean McConville, the mother of ten who was brutally abducted, 
executed and secretly buried in December 1972.

The former IRA terrorists who claim they served alongside Adams say he ordered the killing.

They
 include two damning accounts – one of which was given by ex-hunger 
striker Brendan ‘Darkie’ Hughes, a former deputy commander of the IRA’s 
Belfast Brigade.

Hughes,
 who died in 2008, said McConville was killed on Adams’ orders. ‘There 
was only one man who gave the order for that woman to be executed . . . 
 that man is now the head of Sinn Fein,’ he said.

‘I
 did not give the order to execute that woman. He did. I knew she was 
being executed. I knew that. I didn’t know she was going to be buried or
 disappeared as they called them now.

‘The
 special squad was brought into the operation then called the Unknowns, 
you know, when anyone needed to be taken away, they normally done it. I 
had no control over this squad. Gerry had control over this particular 
squad.’

Denial: Adams has repeatedly denied involvement in McConville's death or the IRA policy of 'The Disappeared'

The
 wild card in any prosecutions could be a former IRA man called Ivor 
Bell, 77, who had a bitter split with Adams in the mid-1980s.

Bell’s
 interviews, if accepted as admissible evidence, could be used against 
Adams because Bell is still alive. Bell was charged in March with aiding
 and abetting in the murder of McConville, which he denies.

Adams
 has repeated and categorically denied involvement in the death or the 
IRA policy of ‘The Disappeared’ – men and women in Northern Ireland 
suspected of being informers of the British who were taken from the 
streets, questioned, shot and buried.

But
 the tapes and subsequent interviews allege a very different story in a 
detailed series of claims which were yesterday being put to the 
65-year-old politician and architect of the Good Friday agreement.
