The adorable story of how Tiny the dog was rescued by the New Zealand Navy after being stuck on a floating log has been set straight by his owner.

Ben Ngawaka, 20, said his pal had, in fact, only been stranded for a few hours on Smokehouse Bay, and not for two days since a storm had hit the area, as previously reported.

Mr Ngawaka said he took his boat out from his home on Rangiahua Island home to do some shopping at the nearest store at Port Fitzroy on Great Barrier Island with his dog on Thursday.

The crew of the New Zealand Navy ship Hawea spotted the dog standing helplessly on a drifting log

He stopped to collect a floating log he thought might be useful for building repairs, Mr Ngawaka told The New Zealand Herald on Sunday.

‘I had a little look for (Tiny) when I got to Fitzroy and couldn't find him. I realised, “oh, my dog must have got off on that log",' he said. ‘He must have thought that when we stopped, we were parking on the shore and jumped off.’

Mr Ngawaka said he wasn't concerned because he knew Tiny would stay put.

In the meantime, the black and white dog was spotted by Able Seaman Combat Specialist Filipe Latu aboard the HMNZS Hawea, while navigating through debris caused by the storm on Tuesday.

He immediately consulted his commanding officer

'Permission to rescue dog floating on a log, Sir,' he said - or a plea similar to that.

Operation dog rescue was activated with speed and naval efficiency.

Bringing the animal to shore, the sailors were quickly notified that there was someone at hand who knew its owner.

The crew handed the dog over to locals who knew the owner before getting back to work by removing debris from the water

When Mr Ngawaka returned a few hours later, he was surprised to find Tiny with the crew who gave him his dog.

Tiny had recovered from the trauma with a feed and a long sleep.

‘He's fine, he's most probably forgotten the whole thing by now,’ he said.

HMNZS Hawea's commanding officer, Lieutenant Anthony Norris, said an animal stuck on a log in the water was an unusual and unexpected sight.

‘There was significant debris in the water and on one large log floating in the water was this poor helpless dog,’ he said.
