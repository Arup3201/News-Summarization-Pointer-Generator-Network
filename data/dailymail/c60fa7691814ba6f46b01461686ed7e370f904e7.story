South Africa coach Russell Domingo is keeping his faith with out-of-form Quinton de Kock despite the opener's lack of runs.

De Kock's 26 against United Arab Emirates in their last World Cup pool game was his highest score in his last seven one-day internationals, a run that followed his century against Australia in November.

The difficult patch, including five single-figure scores, is a far cry from De Kock's early career form, which once saw him score three straight centuries against India in December 2013.

While AB De Villiers and Hashim Amla currently lead the run charts for the Proteas, ahead of their quarter-final against Sri Lanka on Wednesday at Sydney, Domingo is confident De Kock is closer than ever to a match-winning innings.

When asked if De Kock was facing a mental barrier, Domingo told a press conference: 'I am not a sports psychologist but I don't know how a player can be perceived to be mentally shot. It's a little bit nasty.

'It's going to be a tough selection (meeting). On the one hand we know Quinton has got the ability to win games. But it's often difficult to have all six batters in form at the same time.

'We just sort of have this gut feeling that Quinton has got a big score around the corner. He's done well against Sri Lanka. I'm sure he'll have a good feeling playing against Sri Lanka.'

One player De Kock can look up to outside of his own dressing room is Kumar Sangakkara, with the Sri Lankan currently leading the World Cup run-scoring charts at 496 - he has four successive centuries to boot and is fighting for the number one ranking with De Villiers.

For Domingo, though, the law of averages again is a handy way to look at things, as he added: 'He's in the form of his life. You've got to think his low score is just round the corner I suppose.

'But we have worked on some plans that we feel we need to execute well against him.'

And while South Africa hope they have 'learned from the lessons' of past sides, Sri Lanka are getting political in their approach to the knockout stage.

No less than Sri Lanka's president and prime minister have offered their vocal support, with the latter unsurprisingly keen to claim his successful election campaign from January as the benchmark for aiming high.

In quotes paraphrased in a statement on Sri Lanka cricket's website, prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe stressed on the need to study South Africa's weaknesses, adding: 'That's what some of us did last December.'
