British businessman Paul Dunham, 59 (pictured) has been jailed for four years over a £1m fraud

A retired British businessman who took an overdose with his wife to try and avoid extradition to the U.S. over a £1million fraud has been jailed for four years.

Paul Dunham, 59, and his wife Sandra, 58, used fraudulent expense claims to pay for a time share in Barbados,  luxury bedding for their home, a dog sofa and other personal expenses, the  US authorities said.

The pair had been extradited  in May last year, after losing a High Court battle against standing trial in the U.S. over fraud charges relating to Mr Dunham's company, Pace.

Their extradition came days after they attempted to take their own lives at their Northampton home. 

Mr Dunham has now been sentenced for one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one of money laundering over the scheme. 

Michael Evans, Mr Dunham's solicitor, said the defendant would not seek repatriation to the UK, so he can serve his sentence near to his family.

He added that 11 other charges were dismissed against him at the Maryland District Court in Greenbelt as part of a plea deal.

Mr Evans said: 'The US prosecutors have agreed that they will not attempt to block Paul's repatriation to the UK and I will now work with the Ministry of Justice to facilitate his return to serve his sentence in the UK, near to his wife and grandchildren. I look forward to his safe return to the UK.'

A Justice Department spokeswoman said that a U.S. district judge Paul W Grimm today sentenced Dunham to four years in prison, followed by three years of supervised release.   

The authorities told how the defendants had worked for Pace Worldwide, located at various times in Maryland and North Carolina, and had a subsidiary in the United Kingdom named Pace Europe Ltd.

Pace produced parts for the repair and reworking of electronics for the military and others.

Mr Dunham held a number of executive positions there, including president and chief operating officer.

Mrs Dunham was initially hired to work for the European subsidiary in the accounts department, and eventually became the director of sales and marketing for Pace Worldwide. 

Mr Dunham and his wife Sandra (right) used fraudulent expenses claims to pay for a time share in Barbados, along with luxury bedding for their home, a dog sofa and other personal expenses, the US authorities said

The Dunhams moved from the UK to Maryland then North Carolina, and were provided with corporate credit cards. 

Between 2002 and 2009, they fraudulently charged personal expenses to their corporate credit cards and submitted vouchers to Pace for reimbursement that falsely described the expenditures as business expenses, the authorities said.

For example, Mr Dunham represented that $3,007 (£1,900) had been spent on meals during business meetings, when in fact the money was spent on luxury bedding for his North Carolina residence. 

Mrs Dunham also sought reimbursement for $8,397 (£5,330) which she represented as expenses incurred to cancel a holiday due to a business meeting. These expenses were actually mortgage payments the couple made on two separate time share units they had bought in Barbados.

The paid were extradited to the U.S in May last year, days after they attempted to take their own lives at their Northampton home

Other personal expenses which were falsely described as business expenditures included personal legal fees, expensive furniture, a domed pet residence and a dog sofa.

The couple also fraudulently billed Pace Europe Ltd for business expenses already paid by Pace Worldwide, obtaining duplicate reimbursements, the authorities said.

In addition, a substantial portion of the scheme involved Mr Dunham abusing a private position of trust to manage and direct others, including his secretary, in the execution of the scheme.

Moreover, he repeatedly forged receipts and invoices to create the false appearance that they were for business, rather than personal expenses.

Between 2002 and 2009, they fraudulently charged personal expenses to their corporate credit cards and submitted vouchers to Pace for reimbursement, U.S. authorities said

As a result of the lengthy scheme, one million dollars (£635,500) in actual losses were incurred. The couple have agreed to forfeit and pay restitution of that amount, the statement said.

Mr Dunham was originally indicted on 13 counts of fraud and money laundering by a grand jury in Greenbelt, Maryland, in December 2011.

Mrs Dunham was accused of eight counts of fraud for allegedly aiding and abetting him.

In April, they lost a high court battle against extradition. The next month, they were taken to Northampton General Hospital after taking a drug overdose the night before they were due to hand themselves in to police and in turn to U.S. marshals.

Journalists due to take a statement outside their home alerted police when the couple did not answer the door.

Senior District Judge Howard Riddle at Westminster Magistrates' Court concluded that they had deliberately taken an overdose to avoid or delay extradition.

Later the couple, from Northampton, were handed over to U.S. marshals at Heathrow by officers from the Metropolitan Police's extradition unit. 

They then pleaded guilty in December last year. Last week, Mrs Dunham was sentenced to two months imprisonment with credit for time already served in custody, with the judge ordering she serve the remaining 18 days under home detention.

Gary Procter and Deborah Boardman, the couple's US defence attorneys, said after today's hearing that the couple had been through an 'extraordinary ordeal' over the past five years.

'We are disappointed that Paul will have to spend additional time in prison before he is reunited with his family and friends in the UK, but he can finally see light at the end of this long, dark tunnel,' they said in a statement.

'As for Sandra, we are very pleased that she will be returning to the UK in a couple weeks where she will await Paul's return.'
