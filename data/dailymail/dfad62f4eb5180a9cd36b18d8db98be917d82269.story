Oscar Pistorius' representatives have said the substance found in his bedroom after his girlfriend was shot dead was Testis compositum - a herbal remedy used to aid muscle recovery. 

South African police said during the athlete's bail hearing that they found needles in his bedroom along with the substance which they initially named as testosterone. 

Prosecutors later withdrew their statement saying the substance had been sent for laboratory tests and that they would not be able to name it until tests had been completed.

According to Pistorius' family spokesman, Lunice Johnston, the athlete's lawyers have confirmed that the substance is Testis compositum. 

The product is also marketed as a sexual enhancer which can improve stamina.

Some online retailers advertise oral and injectable forms as testosterone boosters and say it can aid sexual performance.

In court last week, Pistorius' defence lawyer Barry Roux said the substance was not banned by sports authorities, but it had been unclear what it was and what the exact name was. 

The product called Testis compositum is made by Biologische Heilmittel Heel GmbH, based in Baden-Baden, Germany.

The company website says it is one of the world's leading makers of homeopathic combination medications. 

A U.S. subsidiary, Heel USA Inc., markets the product in tablet form only and spokeswoman Joan Sullivan said she didn't know if injectable versions are sold in other countries. 

The product is also marketed as a sexual enhancer which can improve stamina

Heel U.S. website says the product provides temporary relief for men's 'sexual weakness' and lack of stamina. 

The tablets sold in the U.S. contain 23 ingredients, including pig testicles, pig heart, pig embryo and pig adrenal gland, cortisone, ginseng and other botanicals. 

It also contains several minerals, according to a list Ms Sullivan provided. 

Charles Yesalis, a professor and expert on steroid use in sports, said animal steroids wouldn't likely have an athletic performance-enhancing effect unless taken in huge quantities. 

Even so, he said many elite athletes would be wary of using such supplements because they can be laced with banned substances and few would want to risk it.

Pistorius was charged with premeditated murder on February 14 after shooting dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. 

He says he shot her by accident after mistaking her for an intruder in his home.

Prosecutors allege he intended to kill her.

Meanwhile Pistorius was last night due to hold a private memorial service for his girlfriend.

Confirmation
of the service to be held at the house of Pistorius’s uncle Arnold in 
Pretoria, where he has been staying since his release on bail, came 
after a leak in the media, reported Sky News.

A
family statement said: ‘Since it is such a sensitive issue, Oscar has 
asked for a private service with people who share his loss, including 
his family members who knew and loved Reeva.’

Pistorius says he killed Miss Steenkamp accidentally, opening fire after mistaking her for an intruder in his home.

Prosecutors alleged he intentionally shot her after the couple had an argument.

Last week, the chief investigator in the case against Pistorius, Hilton Botha, was removed from the inquiry after it was revealed that attempted murder charges against him had been reinstated in early February.

Charged: Carl Pistorius, with sister Aimee, in court to see their brother Oscar granted bail after being charged with murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp

The charges relate to a 2011 incident in which Botha and two other police officers allegedly fired on a minibus.

In another twist, a lawyer for the Pistorius family said on Sunday that Oscar's brother, Carl, faces a charge of unlawful, negligent killing for a 2008 road death.

That charge had also been dropped and later reinstated.
