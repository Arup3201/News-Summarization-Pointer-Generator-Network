The oldest living president's hospitalization was 'out of abundance of caution', a family spokesperson said. He is pictured here at a Houston Texans game on November 23

There has been no word on whether the nation's 41st
president is suffering from any particular ailment. The spokesman said Wednesday that Bush's prognosis was positive and that he
was being kept hospitalized as a precaution.

On Thursday, Bush received a Christmas Day visit from his
wife, Barbara, as well as his son Neil and daughter-in-law,
Maria Bush, and was described as being in 'great spirits.'

'President Bush remains in high spirits and continues to
make progress, but he will remain at the Houston Methodist
Hospital this evening,' a Friday update read.

Bush, who was president from 1989 to 1993, was admitted to
the same hospital in November 2012 for treatment of bronchitis
and related ailments.

Methodist Hospital in Houston is the top-rated hospital in Texas and is nationally ranked, as well

At one point doctors thought he was at death's door, but he recuperated and was
allowed to go home after seven weeks.

The former Republican president suffers from Parkinson's
disease and cannot use his legs. But he celebrated his 90th
birthday on June 12 by skydiving near Kennebunkport, Maine, with
the Army's Golden Knight parachute team.

His eldest son, former President George W. Bush, this year
published a best-selling book entitled, 41 - A
Portrait of My Father.
