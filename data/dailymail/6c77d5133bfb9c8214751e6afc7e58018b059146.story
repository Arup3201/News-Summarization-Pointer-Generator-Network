Manchester City have failed to freshen up their starting line-up despite spending a staggering £327million on new players during the last four years.

The Barclays Premier League champions, who must overturn a 2-1 deficit against Barcelona on Wednesday night if they are to progress to the quarter-finals of the Champions League, have made just two major changes to their starting line-up since the start of the 2011-12 season.

Despite spending an extravagant amount of money, Martin Demichelis and Fernando are the only two players who have managed to hold down a regular starting spot since sealing moves to the Etihad Stadium.

Man City have made just two major changes to their starting line-up since 2011 despite spending £327m - Aleksandar Kolarov will replace Gael Clichy from the side defeated by Barcelona on February 24, 2015

Fernando has replaced Gareth Barry while Martin Demichelis has come in for Joleon Lescott - above picture was taken before Manchester City's 1-1 draw with Napoli on September 14, 2011

The aforementioned duo have replaced Joleon Lescott and Gareth Barry respectively in what is perceived to be Manchester City's strongest line-up. 

Gael Clichy has come close to edging his way into Manchester City's side but he shares left back duties with Aleksandar Kolarov and is suspended on Wednesday after being sent off in the first leg.

Their major European rivals, on the other hand, have made at least six changes to their starting line-ups.

Arsenal have made the most with 10 while upcoming opponents Barcelona have made six.

Manchester City may have to change tack in Europe if they crash out of the Champions League on Wednesday, as a side of their calibre should be progressing to the latter stages of Europe's most prestigious competition.

2011: Hart; Zabaleta, Kompany, Lescott, Kolarov; Silva, Toure, Barry, Nasri; Aguero, Dzeko

2015: Hart; Zabaleta, Kompany, Demichelis, Kolarov; Silva, Toure, Fernando, Nasri; Aguero, Dzeko (two changes)

2015: Ter Stegen; Alves, Mascherano, Pique, Alba; Rakitic, Busquets, Iniesta; Suarez, Messi, Neymar (Six changes)  

European champions Real Madrid have made six major changes in the same period - with the likes of Luka Modric and Gareth Bale sealing moves to the Santiago Bernabeu during the last four years.

Real Madrid have freshened up their side by spending £344m on new players while also selling Angel di Maria, Mesut Ozil and Gonzalo Higuain for big money.  

2011: Casillas; Arbeloa, Carvalho, Ramos, Marcelo; Diarra, Alonso; Di Maria, Ozil, Ronaldo; Benzema

2015: Casillas; Carvajal, Varane, Ramos, Marcelo; Modric, Kroos, Rodriguez ; Ronaldo, Bale, Benzema (Six changes)

Manchester City's major rivals for the Premier League title - Chelsea - have also made a considerable amount of changes during the last four years.

Blues captain John Terry, who seems to be getting better with age, and Branislav Ivanovic are the only real survivors from the 2011-12 season - following a £419m outlay on transfers. 

2011: Cech; Ferreira, Ivanovic, Terry, Cole; Ramires, Essien, Lampard, Malouda; Anelka, Drogba

2015: Courtois; Ivanovic, Cahill, Terry, Azpilicueta; Matic, Fabregas; Hazard, Oscar, Willian, Costa (Nine changes)

Arsene Wenger has revamped his squad during the last four years with the Arsenal boss choosing to change his usual procedure when it comes to signing players.

The Frenchman has splashed the cash on the likes of Ozil, Alexis Sanchez and Danny Welbeck.

2011: Fabianski; Sagna, Koscielny, Vermaelen, Clichy; Nasri, Wilshere, Song, Fabregas, Rosicky; Van Persie

2015: Ospina; Debuchy, Koscielny, Mertesacker, Monreal; Coquelin, Cazorla; Welbeck, Ozil, Sanchez; Giroud (10 changes)

France international Lauren Koscielny is the only survivor from Arsenal's side in 2011

Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich, who won the Champions League in 2013, have also made wholesale changes to their starting line-up throughout the last four years. 

Philipp Lahm, Thomas Muller, Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery have held down a spot despite the club's decision to spend £206m since 2011.

2011: Butt; Breno, Van Buyten, Badstuber, Lahm; Robben, Schweinsteiger, Kroos, Ribery, Muller, Gomez

2015: Neuer; Rafinha, Benatia, Boateng, Lahm; Gotze, Alonso; Ribery, Muller, Robben, Lewandowski (seven changes)
