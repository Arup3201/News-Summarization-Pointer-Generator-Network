High price: Former estate agent Benjamin Evans has been ordered to do 130 hours community service and pay £530 in fines for displaying a fake parking ticket in an attempt to evade paying an £8 daily charge

A former estate agent who stacked up £1,000 in parking fines attempted to cheat the system by displaying a fake ticket on his car, a court was told.

Frustrated with having to pay to park his BMW Benjamin Evans designed a false ticket in an attempt to evade paying the daily £8 charge.

But a savvy traffic warden in Southampton, Hampshire, spotted discrepancies between the ticket Evans was displaying and the standard issue ticket. 

The failed parking tariff dodge has proved expensive for the 27-year-old who has been ordered to pay £530 costs and carry out 130 hours of community service after being found guilty of offences under the Fraud Act.

Giving evidence during his trial at Southampton Magistrates Court , Evans further tried to avoid taking the blame by insisting he knew nothing about the spoof ticket.

Instead he accused a former work colleague and friend, called Jonathan Bailey, of the fraud.

Evans said he drove Bailey to 
their joint place of work every day and in return for his lift Bailey
paid for the parking tickets.

But it transpired no one had been able to trace Bailey and Evans was accused of making him up.

Southampton City Council lawyer 
Francisca Da Costa said Evans had 'invented a fictional character' to 
take the blame when trying to get 'a freebie'.

The court heard how Evans, from Romsey, in Hampshire, was caught out on August 29 last year by warden Christopher Meadows.

Mr Meadows became suspicious after spotting that the ticket on Evan's dashboard had part of its serial number hidden by a 10 pence coin.

He noticed the shading on the city council logo was different to that on genuine tickets and that the number '3' appeared more curved than usual.

The edges of the fake - which declared he had 'paid' for ten hours parking - were also rough, unlike genuine tickets.

Deciding something was wrong the warden slapped a fixed penalty notice on the vehicle.

Evans, who was working for estate agents Your Move at the time, saw the warden from his office nearby and confronted him.

But
when the warden asked Evans to open the car door to show him the ticket
the estate agent refused and walked away, telling Mr Meadows to 'get a 
proper job'.

Scene of the crime: Evans claimed his friend and colleague Jonathan Bailey took responsibility for paying for parking tickets in return for getting a lift into work.

After further investigations, it was revealed that no ticket to the value of £8 had been bought from any of the machines servicing that car park.

Enforcement officers repeatedly contacted Evans to provide his ticket but he failed to produce it and just sent an email complaining about the treatment he had received from Mr Meadows.

Evans, who has three previous convictions for making off without payment, admitted one count of failing to give information which would identify the owner of the car.

He was also found guilty of a second charge of displaying a false parking ticket.

Sentencing him, chairman of the bench Susan Williams told Evans she did not believe his evidence.
