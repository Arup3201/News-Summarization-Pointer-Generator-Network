Boris Johnson today insisted he was backing David Cameron 'all the way' after claims he was waiting for the Prime Minister to fail at the next election.

Ex-Downing Street spin doctor Andy Coulson claimed the London Mayor would not 'stab' the Tory leader in the back but preferred to ‘ride in on his bike to save party and country’ should Mr Cameron and the Conservatives lose the 2015 general election.

But Mr Johnson sought to play down the idea, insisting h was now 'increasingly confident' that Mr Cameron would retain power in two years' time.

Backing: Boris Johnson insisted he was increasingly confident that David Cameron can win the next election

Bike: Ex-spin doctor Andy Coulson claimed the London Mayor, who cycled to a Global University summit today, wanted to ride to the Tory party's rescue after 2015

Mr Coulson, the former News Of The World editor who was forced to resign as No10 director of communications two years ago, said it would be ‘off brand’ for Mr Johnson to plot against the Prime Minister.

Mr Johnson has pledged to complete 
his term as London mayor, which ends in 2016. But he has never ruled out
returning as an MP, which would enable him to put himself forward as 
Conservative leader.

Mr 
Coulson, who is due to stand trial later this year over allegations 
related to phone-hacking, made his comments in an article he wrote for 
GQ magazine on his 10-point master plan for ‘saving’ Mr Cameron.

He wrote: ‘Boris Johnson desperately wants to be prime minister and David has known that fact longer than most.

‘When
Boris asked me to pass on the message that he was keen to stand as 
mayor of London, David responded: “Well, if he wins, he’ll want my job 
next”.’

Andy Coulson (right) said David Cameron knows Boris Johnson wants to be Prime Minister but the Mayor of London thinks it would 'off brand' to directly challenge him

Mr Coulson went on: ‘If proof were needed that our PM is a man untroubled by self-doubt, it came in his next sentence - “so I think he’ll be a bloody brilliant candidate for us”.

‘Stabbing David, or anyone else for that matter, in the back would be distinctly off brand - just not very Boris.

'He would much prefer to see David fail miserably in the election and ride in on his bike to save party and country.’

But Mr Johnson, who has hinted at a desire to lead the Tory party if called upon, insisted he was backing Mr Cameron.

Arriving at a Global Universities Summit, he said: 'Grateful as I always am to Andy for career advice, I am backing David Cameron all the way.

'I'm backing David who I am absolutely increasingly confident is going to win,' he added.

Mr Coulson said the Tories’ strategy 
for beating Labour should involve exposing leader Ed Miliband’s penchant
for ‘keeping his head down’ and ‘pray Ed Balls remains shadow 
chancellor until the election’.

On
Mr Miliband, he wrote: ‘The prime minister must push him to take 
positions: expose his strategy (to keep his head down, silently hope 
that the economy continues to go wonky and, well, just be the other 
guy), challenge him to take a view on the tricky issues opposition 
politicians love to duck....

He said Ed Miliband appointing Ed Balls as Shadow Chancellor was the 'gift that will keep on giving'

‘I’m struck by how detached the opposition front bench appears to be from their leader... I just don’t think they rate him very much.

'And if they don’t, there’s a good chance the public will feel the same way once they get to know him properly.’

He likened the relationship between Mr Miliband and Mr Balls to the ‘shamefully dysfunctional’ Tony Blair and Gordon Brown partnership when Labour were in power.

‘The prime minister should pray Ed Balls remains shadow chancellor until the election,’ Mr Coulson wrote. ‘Appointing him as George’s opposite number was the Miliband gift that will keep on giving.

‘The Tories must look for the divisions and make the most of them a) because they are most certainly real - always a plus - and b) because it’s history repeating itself.

‘We are in this hole at least in part because of the shamefully dysfunctional Blair/Brown relationship. Labour’s Two Eds dislike each other and each thinks he is smarter than the other.

‘The Conservatives should imagine in some detail how it would work if they actually won, and share that vision with the British public.’

Mr Coulson is also facing charges over an alleged conspiracy to bribe public officials for information.
