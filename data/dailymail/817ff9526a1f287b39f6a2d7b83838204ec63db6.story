A decanter box that belonged to the Duke of Wellington and may have been used during the Battle of Waterloo has been uncovered on the BBC's Antiques Roadshow.

The old mahogany box was bought by Edgerton Falconer at an auction in the late 19th century but remained locked for 75 years because he did not have a key for it.

It was not until his grandson, David Falconer, inherited the box that the lock was prised open with a screwdriver and a cheque signed by Wellington found inside, along with 10 glass wine and brandy decanters.

Piece of history: Henrietta Wilson shows the decanter box owned by the Duke of Wellington to a delighted Clive Stewart-Lockhart on the Antiques Roadshow

Valuable item: The cheque signed by Wellington is worth the equivalent of £100,000 today and could have been used to buy the silence of a mistress

Mr Falconer's daughter, Henrietta Wilson, showed the box to antiques specialist Clive Stewart-Lockhart at an event for the TV show in Chichester, West Sussex.

Mr Stewart-Lockhart speculated that the £195 - equivalent to £100,000 today - may have been intended to buy the silence of one of Wellington’s 
mistresses.

'He had a number of mistresses over the
years, including one called Harriet Wilson who threatened to write her 
memoirs and he said "publish and damned", said Mr Stewart-Lockhart.

He added: 'Is this £100,000 to pay off someone like Harriet?'

The Coutts 
Bank cheque was dated March 1823 - eight 
years after the Duke of Wellington defeated Napoleon at Waterloo.

Experts believe the discovery of the cheque is evidence the box once belonged 
to the British war hero.

Years ago banks used to send cheques back to their owners once they had been processed.

Arthur Wellesley was the first Duke of Wellington and one of the leading military and political figures of the 19th century.

He is often referred to as 'the Duke of Wellington' though there have been several since.

Heroic Wellington took part in 60 battles during his military career, including commanding the allied army that defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo.

He was twice prime minister under the Tory party and oversaw the passage of the Catholic Relief Act 1829.

He was one of the leading figures in the House of Lords until his retirement and remained Commander-in-Chief of the British Army until his death.

Mr Stewart-Lockhart added: 'There is another thing that happened in
1823 - his son bought a commission in the army.

'Was it to buy his son’s
commission? It’s still an awful lot of money.'

It has been described as a 'campaign decanter set' and specialists believe it may well have been in Wellington’s private camp at Waterloo in Belgium.

Mr Stewart-Lockhart added: 'It is a campaign decanter case so did the Duke take it on his campaign? In which case, was it at Waterloo?'

Mrs Wilson, 42, from Hampshire, said her great-grandfather bought the set at a London auctioneers in the late 19th century.

He bequeathed it to his son John, a lawyer, who in turn left it to his schoolteacher son David - Mrs Wilson’s late father.

She said: 'The set had been locked ever since my great-grandfather bought it and it was just used as a piece of furniture by my family.

'Then in about 1965 my father became very curious about what was inside this box.

'He tried several keys and it wouldn’t open and against all his best principles he used a screwdriver to ease the lock.

'There was small amount of damage to the wood and lock.

'He
found the bottles and then this piece of paper fell to the floor and he
picked it up and saw it was the Duke of Wellington cheque.

'Since then we have always called it the Wellington chest and we like the romance and the "what ifs" about it.

'We don’t believe it would be right to sell it.'

Priceless: The box was bought at auction by Mrs Wilson's great-grandfather and she said her family like the 'romance' of it

Bested: Napoleon Bonaparte had superior numbers

The return of Napoleon from exile induced allied leaders to prepare to attack France.

Wellington,
with an army based in Brussels, was in contact with the Prussian 
commander Blücher to his east, but Napoleon seized an early advantage, 
beating the Prussians at Ligny on June 16.

Although
Wellington held off the French at Quatre Bras the same day, he had to 
fall back to the low ridge of Mont St Jean, south of Brussels.

Blücher agreed to join him on the ridge, and Napoleon's subordinate Marshal Grouchy failed to block his advance.

On June 18, Napoleon, with 72,000 men, waited for the ground to firm up and attacked late.

Though
there were moments when the French came close to winning - Wellington's 
68,000 men, many sheltered from fire by the ridge, were still holding on
when the Prussians arrived.

While
Wellington could never have won without 'the best of all instruments, 
British infantry', Dutch and Hanoverian troops made a vital 
contribution, and his plan depended on Blücher keeping his word. 
Waterloo was decisive, ending the Napoleonic restoration.
