A mysterious scrapbook of pressed flowers that a soldier
sent to his sweetheart while he was fighting in the First World War has come to
light.

The book belonged to a woman named only as Lizzie and was
used by her to keep flowers that her soldier boyfriend sent home from the
battlefield.

The man, who is referred to as 'Bert' sent the cuttings to
the young woman by post while he fought in the war from 1917 to 1919.

Flowers from the front line: A  scrapbook filled with pressed flowers that a soldier sent to his sweetheart while he was fighting in the First World War has been unearthed

The plants include Ivy, plucked from foliage 11 miles from
Arras in France, where the famous Battle of Arras took place. The page is dated
10 March, 1918.

Another page features what is thought to be a stonecrop from
Riese in Italy, dated 16 July with no year, and a sprig from the Messines Ridge
in Belgium from July 1917.

Floral fancies: The plants include Ivy (left) plucked from foliage 11 miles from Arras in France, where the famous Battle of Arras took place and Viola (right)

Additional pressed examples are believed to include viola,
bracken leaf, and aquilegia.

There is even a plant from when Bert was stationed in Devon,
which has lead experts to believe that the couple may have been from the area.

Many of the pages are torn and discoloured and the flowers
are extremely delicate and frail but they have remained firmly in place due to
the wax sealant they were affixed with.

The book was discovered during a house clearance in Gosport,
Hampshire, in 1972 and was kept by one of the removal men.

He is now selling the book after having it for 41 years and
it is expected to fetch £100 when it goes under the hammer at Dukes Auctions in
Dorchester, Dorset.
