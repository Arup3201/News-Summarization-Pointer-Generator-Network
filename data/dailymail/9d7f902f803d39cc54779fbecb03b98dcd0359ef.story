Sydney Swans AFL star Adam Goodes says he accepts that his stature as Australian of the Year and his desire to be outspoken about indigenous rights makes him a target for personal racist attacks.

In the past week Goodes was racially abused by an Essendon fan, booed during the clash despite making no wrong moves, and was the victim of a series of vicious online attacks.

However, the 34-year-old has vowed to not back down in his role as an indigenous leader, even if that means he's subjected to further abuse.

'I actually feel I've been in training for this role, to be honest,' Goodes said at a media conference at the SCG on Thursday.

Adam Goodes said in a press conference on Thursday that he will continue to take his position as an indigenous role model seriously and defend himself against racist attacks

'When you play at a football club and you don't play well, you do get your head knocked off'It's not the first time I've had to go through something like this.

'Yeah, I'm putting my neck out there and, at times, people want to knock it off. But I'll continue putting my neck out there because there are so many good people out there who are supporting the messages, who want to see some changes.'

Despite some criticism about his front-foot-forward approach to dealing with discrimination, the Swans star maintains silence is not the answer.

'Unfortunately, some people don't want to have those conversations - they might not be ready. But I'm definitely ready,' he said.

'It's not a comfortable thing to talk about; definitely it's not a comfortable thing to go through. It's going to cause a stir and it's going to cause people to have conversations, but let's talk about it... Once we talk about it, see what it's like, then we can self-regulate and say that's not right.'

In the past week the star Swans player has been racially attacked both at a game and on social media

Goodes was with his mother unveiling the new guernseys for the indigenous round, which the player's mum Lisa designed

Goodes was at the cricket ground with his mother Lisa to unveil the Swans' jersey for indigenous round that's been designed by her.

This is the first time the Sydney Swans will wear an indigenous jersey for the round, and the design pays tribute to Goodes' late Auntie, according to Business Insider.

Earlier in the week, the star centre half forward was labelled an 'ape', a 'hairy monkey' and a 'black dog' beneath a Facebook poll for AFL's most hated player, reports the Herald Sun. 

The offending comments have since been removed, however a number of crude anti-Goodes remarks remain on the 'Footy's Most Awkward Moments' Facebook page.

The page, which boasts more than 54,000 likes, posted the results of a poll on Monday in which users were asked to vote for the player they hate the most in the AFL, with Goodes ranking second behind Richmond forward Jack Riewoldt.

'These sort of comments are appalling, shocking and a stark reminder that we still have work to do in this area,' Swans chief executive Andrew Ireland told News Corp Australia.

'Racism has no place in society. Not on the football field, not in the stands, not on social media and not anywhere else.

'The positive from the weekend was the willingness of crowds to stand up and not tolerate this sort of behaviour, regardless of their allegiances.'

According to the Herald Sun, fellow indigenous footballer Cyril Rioli took a number of screen grabs of the comments and posted them to his Twitter account.

'Goodes is a hairy monkey and deserves his place on this list,' was one of the comments shared by the disgusted Hawthorn forward.

Sydney Swans veteran Adam Goodes earlier revealed his friendship with Eddie McGuire was over following the racial comments he made about the player last year.

The dual Brownlow Medalist broke his silence over McGuire's on-air gaffe when he suggested Goodes, 34, be part of the promotion of King Kong the musical.

It happened just days after one of the games most loyal servants was called an 'ape' by a 13-year-old girl during a match against Collingwood - the club McGuire is president of.

Adam Goodes revealed he no longer considers McGuire a friend while speaking at a corporate business breakfast in Sydney.

At the time of the incident McGuire, 49, went public with an apology and said he would remain as Collingwood President despite pressure for him to resign.

'Burns me to the core' Eddie McGuire said he felt deeply upset about the comments he made about dual Brownlow Medalist Adam Goodes last year

He said: 'It burns me to the core that I would be associated with vilifying.'

AFL boss Andrew Demetriou said McGuire's comments would be investigated, but his position at Collingwood remained in tact.

At the time Goodes singled the young fan out in the crowd, McGuire stood united with him in their bid to stamp out racial vilification in the game.

He reacted by stepping in to support Goodes and even shook his hand in the dressing room after the final siren went.

But all his good work was undone when the Triple M radio presenter made a terrible error in judgement by suggesting Adam Goodes be flown down from Sydney to Melbourne to help promote King Kong the musical.

According to Fairfax Media reports, Goodes said he would still be prepared to shake McGuire's hand, but would not regard the gesture as an act of friendship.

'To have a friend and someone there that night who shook my hand in the dressing room afterwards, to have him say what he did was disappointing and uncomfortable but that’s how friendships end,' he said.

Goodes also said he did not regret singling out the young girl who had vilified him.

'It was just a natural part of what I would do on a footy field,' he said.

'It was part of me acting instinctively.'

At 34, Goodes has played more than 300 AFL matches for Sydney and was twice named the best player of the year.

He was crowned the Brownlow Medalist in 2003 and 2006 and was this year given the country's top honour when named Australian Of The Year this year.
