It's the nation's favorite burger chain, more secret than In-N-Out and with only 11 restaurants outside of California, even rarer.

Founded in Santa Barbara in 1969, The Habit Burger Grill was crowned America's best fast food burger in a recent survey, trumping the hugely popular and fashionable In-N-Out, despite having little to none brand recognition.

Indeed, after the publication of the Consumer Reports findings earlier this month, The Habit's website crashed, presumably due to millions of Americans trying to discover how they could get their hands on the nation's best burger.

Number 1: The Habit Burger Grill's Charburger is the nation's favorite according to a recent survey published in July

The Consumer Reports survey was notable for the fact that McDonalds came last in addition to the fact that In-N-Out didn't take the top spot.

The comprehensive survey included 65 chains at which 96,208 burgers, chicken sandwiches, subs, sandwiches and burrito's were eaten.

The survey posed this simple question, 'On a scale of  1 to 10, from least delicious to most delicious you’ve ever eaten, how would you rate the taste?'

With The Habit's cheesburgers scoring above eight on the scale, California's best kept fast-food secret suddenly became an obsession for East Coasters everywhere.

Besting famous chains like Five Guys and East Coast favorite Shake Shack, The Habit is known for its signature Charburger and has only recently expanded into Utah and Arizona.

However, unlike In-N-Out, who steadfastly refuse to come to the East Coast, The Habit is opening a restaurant in New Jersey, just 30 minutes from New York City.

Its burgers have no gimmick and do not look fancy.

In fact the Charburger is a classic patty with 'mayonnaise, pickle, fresh tomato, lettuce and caramelized onions on a toasted bun.'

Toppings: The burgers come with mushroom toppings and bacon and have been voted the best in the country

Also on the menu are a fresh grilled albacore tuna sandwich, salads and shakes, sundaes and cones.

The Consumer reports survey  found 21 other burgers more palatable than McDonald's Big Mac.

The 2014 results show a shift in American fast-food preference, with diners placing a new importance on quality over convenience compared to the 2011 report.

'Fast-casual dining in places like Chipotle and Panda Express lets the consumer guide the staff to prepare their meal just the way they like it, Darren Tristano, executive vice president of Technomic, a food-service research and consulting firm, told the magazine.

Chains like Noodles & Company and Panera, which serve meat produced without antibiotics, also ranked higher on the lists.

This change in eating habits may be influenced by the millennial generation, the magazine says, who are eating at cheap fast-casual restaurants in order to dine out more often. 

Bottom: It may be the world second largest fast-food franchise, but McDonald's serves up the worst fast-food burgers in the United Stats according to a new survey
