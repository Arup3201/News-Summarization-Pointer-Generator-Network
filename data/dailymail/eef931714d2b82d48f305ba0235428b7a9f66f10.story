Pregnant: Equalities minister Jo Swinson is due to give birth on Christmas Day

It is seen as one of the cradles of democracy.

But as one mother-to-be found out, the House of Commons is no hotbed of chivalry

Yet while the incident led to a stream of protests on Twitter and was condemned by some Tory MPs who had been sitting at the other end of the chamber, Miss Swinson could not see what the fuss was about.

David Cameron made clear that giving up a seat for a pregnant woman was the 'decent thing' to do.

But Miss Swinson believes it was ‘quite sexist’ to suggest she was not capable of standing.

The incident reignited the debate about whether people should offer their seat to pregnant women, and whether expectant mothers should assume they would.

Miss Swinson champions women’s rights in government and has called for a change in attitudes to new parents.

But onlookers were alarmed to see the 33-year-old standing during throughout PMQs yesterday, while Labour, Tory and Lib Dem  backbenchers sat nearby.

As David Cameron took questions in the Commons at midday every seat was taken, leaving a large group of MPs standing by the main doors.

Miss Swinson, who is due to give birth on Christmas Day, was among them.

But none of the MPs sitting just feet away offered her a seat – to the surprise of Westminster observers.

James Forsyth, political editor of The Spectator, wrote on Twitter: ‘Quite remarkable that no MP has offered Jo Swinson, who is seven months pregnant, a seat.

'Really shocking lack of manners and decency.’

However aides to Miss Swinson claimed the idea that she was not capable of standing was 'sexist'.

A source close to the minister said: ‘The suggestion somehow that people should be outraged on her behalf is ridiculous. The idea that just because she is seven months pregnant she has lost all ability to stand on her two feet or fend for herself is quite sexist.

'She did not think it was an issue. If she had wanted to sit down she would have asked to sit. She is quite capable of fulfilling her functions as a minister – including standing and walking – while she is pregnant. She is not somehow severely incapacitated.’

However Mr Cameron's official spokesman insisted the Prime Minister thought anyone should give up their seat for a pregnant woman.

'Take the example of public transport
 - I think if you see someone who is in greater need of a seat than 
yourself I think offering that seat is a good thing to do... a decent thing to do,' the 
spokesman said.

Asked if Mr Cameron would offer his seat to a pregnant woman if he was on a bus, the spokesman said: 'I'm sure he would.'

Pressed on whether that would be a 
sexist thing to do, the spokesman said: 'Offering one's seat to someone 
who is in greater need than oneself on public transport? I think that's a
 very understandable thing to do.'

The issue of whether to offer up a seat to a pregnant woman has become increasingly vexed.

In one camp are those that argue expectant mothers are more likely to be tired - they are carrying around another person after all - and will appreciate the option of sitting down.

But critics say the idea that a pregnant woman cannot stand up on a train or a bus is sexist and patronising.

Last year mother-to-be Meenakshi Minnis hit out at 'barbaric' passengers on a packed Manchester tram who refused to give up their tram seat - even though she is eight months' pregnant and needs crutches to walk.

When Kate Middleton, five months pregnant, was presented with a 'Baby On Board' in March last year she joked she would 'wear it at home'.

The source close to Miss Swinson said the minister did not 
want to ‘give a running commentary’ on whether she had been offered or 
accepted seats in other circumstances, such as on public transport.

‘Sometimes
 she’s in the middle of a carriage surrounded by people who are also 
standing so other passengers may not see her,’ the source added. ‘She 
does not necessarily feel aggrieved about that.’

Miss Swinson is a junior business minister working with Vince Cable, and has pushed for greater equality for women at work.

She
 has admitted the pressure of carrying a baby was taking its toll on 
being a minister in the government and Lib Dem MP for East 
Dunbartonshire.

However the source resented the idea that Miss Swinson has been made to like 'some sort of victim'.

'She arrived ten minutes late for PMQs, and that’s why she was standing right at the back,’ the source said.

‘She
 wasn’t visible to the majority of MPs who had their backs to her. She 
also knew she had to leave early because she had another event to go to.

‘She
 was standing talking to a colleague, and she was perfectly happy 
standing. She was perfectly happy being where she was and did not feel 
the need to have a seat. If she needed to have a seat, or had felt she 
wanted to have one, she would have been perfectly capable of asking.

Once tipped as a future Scottish 
Secretary, she admitted she will not be able to lead the charge in next 
year’s independent referendum.

‘Clearly,
 there will be a period when I won’t be able to be quite as active on 
the doorsteps,’ she told the Independent on Sunday last month.

‘But,
 yes, I want to be strongly involved in that campaign because I believe 
it’s so important for the future of Scotland and, indeed, for the future
 of the UK.’

She is also adamant that she will not take ministerial red boxes while on maternity leave.

‘I am still very committed and enjoy my job and want to come back to continue doing that, but I think having a bit of time to do that early bonding is also really important.’

Government: Miss Swinson is a close ally of Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and has been tipped for the Cabinet

The coalition has agreed new rules 
allowing new parents work alternate months for up to a year under moves 
to tear up ‘old-fashioned and rigid’ workplace rules.

Mums
 and dads will be able to ‘mix and match’ how they look after a newborn 
baby for their first year. They will be able to take up a total of 52 
weeks in joint leave, either taking it in turns or at the same time.

Ministers hope the changes will encourage fathers to play a bigger role in raising their child while mothers are able to return to work at a time of their choosing.

Miss Swinson said she had discussed with her husband Duncan Hames, who is also a Lib Dem MP, about how to ‘share the parenting as much as possible’.

She added: ‘Like most new parents, we are both very excited about our new arrival and wanting to be very hands-on from the start.’
