Data for the first 12 months of the 
Work Programme showed the £5billion initiative secured lasting 
employment for just one in every 50 people referred, at a cost of 
£14,000 a job.

The 
scheme – personally championed by the Prime Minister – pays private 
sector firms such as A4e and G4S to find jobs for the long-term 
unemployed.

But of the 
785,360 people referred to the Work Programme in its first year, just 
18,270 were found a lasting job – equal to just 2.3 per cent.

Champion: The back-to-work scheme is a flagship programme for the 
PM while Employment Minister Mark Hoban insisted it was still early days for 
the £5billion scheme

Officials
 at the Department for Work and Pensions had estimated that 5 per cent 
would find jobs on their own if the scheme did not exist, and firms were
 set a minimum target of getting 5.5 per cent of ‘clients’ into work in 
the first year.

Employment
 minister Mark Hoban said last night it was ‘early days’, and pointed 
out that the targets were set when economic growth forecasts were 
better.

He added that 
more than 200,000 people had been found work  of some sort, although in 
many cases this lasted only a few weeks or months.

He said it was ‘clearly ridiculous’ to suggest that more people would have found jobs if the Work Programme had not existed.

Only 3.5 per cent of people referred to the Work Programme in its first year stayed off benefits and in a job

Spending
 on the programme so far totals £435million. Providers can earn between 
£3,700 and £13,700 per person, depending how hard it is to help them, 
with an initial payment of £400-£600.

The
 main payments are only made after someone has been in work for six 
months – the Government’s definition of sustained employment.

The figures reveal wide 
variations in the performance of the companies involved, but Mr Hoban 
said the worst had been warned they could be stripped of their contracts
 unless they upped their game by next April.

Labour
 branded the scheme  a ‘miserable failure’, and shadow work and pensions
 secretary Liam Byrne said the figures revealed it was ‘comprehensively 
failing’.

Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons 
public accounts committee, said the initiative was falling ‘woefully 
short of expectations’. 

Woefully short of expectation: Chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, Margaret Hodge criticised the scheme

She added: ‘The success of this 
programme will be measured on getting people off unemployment benefit 
and into sustainable jobs who without the programme would not have found
 work.

‘There is little value to the taxpayer or society in having people sitting on a scheme for over  two years.’

Individuals
 are placed on the programme for two years, meaning a full assessment of
 it will not be possible for another 12 months.

Officials
 said the most recent figures, covering the scheme’s first 14 months, 
suggested it was starting to take off, with the jobs rate improving 
slightly to 3.5 per cent.

Public
 concern over the programme erupted earlier this year when it emerged 
that A4e boss Emma Harrison had paid herself £8.6million last year, 
despite claims that the firm’s record in finding jobs for the unemployed
 was ‘abysmal’.

It also emerged that the firm was being investigated by the police over allegations of fraud.

Mrs
 Harrison was forced to resign as the company’s chairman and quit her 
role as Mr Cameron’s ‘back to work’ tsar in the resulting row, although 
she remains the main shareholder in A4e.
