A great-grandmother died in agony after staff at her care home failed to notice how much pain she was in.

Margaret Hall, 78, was left screaming in pain and dying in the lounge of Eastbank Care Home in Glasgow without any pain relief.

Bupa, the company that runs the home, has now apologised to the dementia sufferer’s family.

Margaret Hall, 78, died in agony at Eastbank Care Home in Glasgow. She was left without any pain relief in the home's lounge because staff failed to notice she was dying

Once her condition was discovered, the home was unable to give her any drugs as the medication she needed was not kept on site because of ‘cost and wastage’, the Daily Record reports.

On a previous occasion, staff at the home had also left Mrs Hall lying in a cold bath as they forgot she was there.

He daughter, Elizabeth Peebles, 53, told the Daily Record: ‘We are just distraught over what mum went through. She went through hell.’

Mrs Hall, who left behind her husband, Eric Hall, 75, moved into the care home in 2009 when her dementia meant her family was no longer able to care for her.

Her family say they repeatedly thought of calling the Care Commission but that they were worried about Mrs Hall being at the home while an investigation was under way.

Ms Peebles explained that she wanted to complain but that there was nowhere else for her to go.

She was found crying out in pain by her daughter, Elizabeth Peebles, 53. Ms Peebles asked for her mother to be given pain relief but was told the medication was not kept on site

She says she even considered putting an extra bed in her living room but that she could not afford not to work.

Ms Peebles added that she once went to visit her mother and found her lying shivering in a freezing cold bath.

She says that she had to help her mother out of the bath before warming her up with a hair dryer.

Ms Peebles explained that on the day her mother died, she found her in a lounge packed full of people and clearly in terrible pain.

She told the Daily Record: ‘I could instantly see the deathly colour of her. She was holding my hand really tightly, roaring with pain and clutching her chest. You could hear the crackle in her chest.’

Ms Peebles demanded to know why her mother had not been given any pain relief earlier but was told that the necessary medication was not kept at the home because of the cost.

Mrs Hall died shortly after her daughter arrived and just before the medication she needed was delivered to the home.

After Mrs Hall’s death, her family lodged five complaints with the care home.

They say that she was given no pain relief when she was dying, that no end-of-life drugs were ordered for her, that she was left in the lounge when she was dying, that she was not given proper care for a mouth infection and that she was left in a cold bath.

Bupa has written to the family and admitted fault in all five incidents.

On another occasion, Ms Peebles found Mrs Hall lying shivering in a freezing cold bath because staff had forgotten she was there. Bupa has now apologised to Mrs Hall's family

Vivienne Birch, Director of Partnerships, Bupa Care Services said: ‘The care we provided to Mrs Hall did not meet the usual high standards we provide, and again we would like to send our apologies and condolences to her family.

'A thorough investigation revealed that there were concerns raised with regards to Mrs Hall’s general care including her pain relief, end of life care and oral care.

'As a result, the care home has taken action to ensure that all our residents’ needs are met at all times. For example, our staff have since received further training and supervision in end of life care.

'The health and well being of our residents remains our absolute priority.'
