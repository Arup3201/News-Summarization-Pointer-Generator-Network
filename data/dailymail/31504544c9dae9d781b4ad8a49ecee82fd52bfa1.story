Diego Simeone's future at Atletico Madrid has been thrown up in the air after the manager hinted he could be ready to leave the club.

The Argentine described himself as 'notoriously impatient' and insinuated that he wouldn't be the sort of boss to stick around for years.

Simeone has been in charge at the Vicente Calderon for three seasons – winning the La Liga title and almost clinching the Champions League trophy in May.

They were eventually beaten to the continental prize by capital rivals Real in Lisbon and there is a school of thought that the 44-year-old has taken the club as far as he can.

Atletico lie four points behind Carlo Ancelotti's side as they attempt to retain their crown, but Simeone suggested that he could quit the club.

'I'm a spontaneous guy, and spontaneous people are notoriously impatient. I can't stay for 10 years at the same club,' he said on French TV.

It is quite the about-turn, given Simeone told Marca that he was happy with the club only a fortnight ago: 'I feel very good at Atletico. I always want to continue improving, I'm never satisfied. I don't know what the limit of this team is, I will continue looking.' 

And the former Lazio and Inter Milan midfielder – who is building a reputation as one of the brightest young coaches in Europe – also chose to heap praise on Paris Saint-Germain.

He added: 'PSG's project keeps improving. They are constructing a great team with renowned players. But you have to find players that are conscious of the objective of the club, which is the Champions League.'
