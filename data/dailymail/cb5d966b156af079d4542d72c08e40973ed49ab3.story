The family of Shaker Aamer (pictured with two of his children) have begged the Government to have him returned to Britain to face charges before a court

The family of Shaker Aamer, the London father who has been held at Guantanamo Bay for almost 13 years, said last night that he desperately wants the chance to stand trial for his alleged crimes.

They broke their silence to insist that if the 46-year-old came home he would have no hesitation in facing a British court to lay to rest grave allegations that he is a dangerous terrorist.

The father-of-four is being detained without charge at the notorious US military detention centre and claims he has been tortured there.

He is accused of being a close associate of Osama bin Laden, which he denies. He wants to ‘speak for his innocence’ in front of a jury, his loved ones said – adding that they were praying for his return to Britain.

They spoke as Downing Street maintained that the UK was continuing to press the case at the ‘highest levels’ – a diplomatic euphemism for the White House.

Amid the shockwaves from the Senate report laying bare the scale of barbarity inflicted on terror suspects, a spokesman for David Cameron said the Government was pushing for Mr Aamer’s release ‘as a matter of urgency’. She said: ‘We will keep pressing it. It is our objective to get him back to the UK. That decision is in the hands of the US government.

‘We are doing all we can to work with the US to encourage them to reach a decision.’

As outrage intensified over his captivity, Mr Aamer’s family spoke out to insist there was no justification for holding him at the controversial US naval facility in Cuba.

His brother-in-law Tan Ahmad, 35, who works in his family’s business and lives in Wandsworth, south London, told the Daily Mail: ‘Shaker Aamer should be allowed to come back to the UK.

‘He can then speak for his innocence of terrorism in front of a British court. He hasn’t seen his wife and children for 13 years and just wants to come back to Britain to be with them. He would have been released long ago anyway if it wasn’t for the fact that he is a translator, so speaks up for all the prisoners to the authorities. They don’t like him for that. If he had kept himself to himself they might have let him go.’ Mr Ahmad added: ‘He is not a terrorist.

‘Religiously, we don’t believe in killing innocent people.’

Saudi-born Mr Aamer moved to London almost 20 years ago and has a British wife with whom he lived in Battersea, south London.

He has been cleared for release twice by the US, first in 2007. But his detention has been extended persistently because officials insist he must go back to Saudi Arabia, rather than home to Britain.

Mr Ahmad, brother of Mr Aamer’s wife Zinneera, 39, said: ‘The Americans want to send him to Saudi Arabia but he doesn’t want to go because his wife and children are here in Battersea. He has broken Saudi law by marrying a foreigner so would be in trouble there.’ Lawyers for Mr Aamer insist he is still being held because the security agencies fear he will reveal details of British complicity in CIA torture.

Clive Stafford Smith, of human rights charity Reprieve, who represents Mr Aamer, claims he was in the room when another captive called Ibn Sheikh al-Libi was being mistreated in the presence of UK intelligence officers.

Mr Stafford Smith said: ‘Shaker knows too much. National embarrassment isn’t a reason to keep a man who has been cleared for release locked away. Shaker must be returned to his family in London at once.’

He spoke out as a campaign to free Mr Aamer gathered momentum. Hundreds of people joined the ‘We Stand For Shaker’ movement, including acclaimed actors Mark Rylance and Vanessa Redgrave.

Mr Aamer was detained in Kabul, Afghanistan, in 2001 after, his representatives claim, travelling to the country to carry out peaceful voluntary work for an Islamic charity.

His supporters claim he was captured by bounty hunters and eventually handed to American forces, who allegedly tortured him at a secret ‘black site’ prison – effectively a dungeon – at Bagram air force base, near Kabul.

He was then sent to Guantanamo Bay in February 2002, where he remains with about 100 prisoners.
