Valerie Baber was one of several prostitutes out of the job when New York escort service the Emperors Club was busted in 2008, following a federal investigation of then-Governor Eliot Spitzer

A former prostitute at the escort agency famously exposed in the federal investigation of then-New York Governor Eliot Spitzer has written an essay about her time as a sex worker, after leaving the business to get her master's degree.

Valerie Baber went by the name Racquel when she worked at the Emperors Club - a prostitution service for VIPs in New York that was disbanded in 2008 following the revelation that Governor Spitzer was 'Client 9'.

But Baber only has positive reviews of working at the Emperors Club, and even admits enjoying some of the sex she had with Forbes-listers, royalty, politicians, athletes, celebrities and industry titans.

Baber says '90 per cent' of her clients were attractive and influential people who didn't have to pay for sex but did it out of convenience or addiction.

'In my dealings with clients, I often felt like they could be addicts,' she said. 'But I didn't mind, and it has never been my job to overthink it.'

She adds that the work wasn't always easy. Most of the men she slept with made her do all the work in the bed.

'That's how all of my clients preferred it. I guess if I were paying $1,500 an hour, I wouldn't want to do any work either,' she said.

Among her regular clients were 'professional gamblers and boxers, top-tier doctors and lawyers, high-flying finance types, an Ivy league professor and several successful entrepreneurs.'

Baber liked being a prostitute because she could make more in one hour than seven hours dancing as a stripper, one of her previous occupations.

'A high-end agency would allow me to take a break from the unhealthy world of gentlemen’s clubs. I’d need to meet with only one man instead of 40. I wouldn’t have to be around a group of vapid people in various stages of chemical alteration, and unlike the guys I had to approach at the club, I knew the men I’d meet through a service would be guaranteed to want my company—they would have already handpicked me,' she said. 'I’d also be able to get to bed at a reasonable time and get up in the morning with the rest of the normal world. '

But her life of easy money came crashing down the day she received a phone call from Agent Kenneth Hosey, asking to meet as soon as possible.

Baber lawyered up and signed a proffer agreement to divulge everything she knew about the club to federal investigators. While she knew prostitution was against the law, Baber didn't know why she was being targeted.

'I felt violated and confused. Why was it anyone’s business what I did in my private life? I hadn’t hurt anyone. I paid my taxes. I helped women with strollers down subway stairs.

'I was made to feel as though I had done something truly horrible. But I knew with every fiber of my being that I had done nothing wrong. In fact, I’m still unsure what “crime” was ever committed.'

Baber ended up having to pay her lawyer $25,000 to settle the issue.

After the end of the Emperor's Club, Baber temporarily moved to the U.K. where she got two university degrees from the University of Sussex and Middlesex University. She also received a degree from NYU.

While the end of the Emperors Club turned out to be a good thing for Baber in that she was finally able to go back to school, it was more traumatic for Spitzer.

After the revelation that he slept with an Emperors Club escort named Ashley Dupre, Spitzer resigned and he was unsuccessful when he tried to salvage his career by running in New York City's comptroller race this year - losing out to Scott Stringer.  

Looking back on the prostitute part of her life, Baber says it helped her learn that men 'aren't pigs' and just like women, they 'need to be with someone who puts effort into maintaining all the things that attracted them in the first place.'

'It seems simple enough, but these things often go neglected by their wives and partners.'
