A stray cat which survived being kicked 20ft through the air by a man in Brooklyn has been tracked down by a team of animal shelter rescuers and taken to a vet.

A man police claim is Andre Robinson, 21, was filmed kicking the gray cat into bushes after initially luring it towards him.

Robinson was arrested following an online campaign. He was released on no bond on Tuesday after he was charged with aggravated animal cruelty.

A video posted to Facebook showed a man brutally kicking a stray cat 20 feet through the air at a Brooklyn housing complex

The man, who police have identified as 21-year-old Andre Robinson, uses his right foot to kick the cat into the air

'King' the cat was taken in by volunteers from Sean Casey Animal Rescue

Attempts to find the feline initially came up short and police were unsure on Monday if the animal had survived.

On
 Tuesday however a team from the North Shore Animal League managed to 
track him down after arriving at the Brooklyn housing complex, the New York Daily News reported.

The
 cat reportedly led the team, which included NYPD officers and members 
of Sean Casey Animal Rescue, on a chase which lasted two-and-a-half 
hours.

The stray, which has 
been dubbed 'King' by some residents, initially hid in the engine 
compartment of a parked minivan before running off to a Ford Explorer.

He was eventually cornered under a dumpster but it still took another 45 minutes before he was coaxed into a cage.

Robinson was arrested on Monday and appeared at Brooklyn Criminal Court the following day.

In the video a man can be seen to kick a cat before laughing and celebrating with a dance.

An NYPD source told the New York Post: 'We were able to identify him as part of an investigation behind the video.

'People who saw were really disturbed by it.'Â 

One of the first steps was identifying the area of New York where the attack occurred.

One
 Facebook user used video enhancing software to blow up the scene and 
see details that later led police to identify the scene of the crime as a complex in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood.

Residents of the housing complex told police the stray cat was a fixture in the area.
