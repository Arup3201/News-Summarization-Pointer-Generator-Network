The only thing worse than getting caught somewhere you shouldn't be is getting caught lying about it.

That's what happened to Kentucky Senate candidate Matt Bevin on Thursday night when a local news station played video of the Tea Party Republican at a pro-cockfighting rally saying he would 'not support' future efforts to criminalize the blood-sport. 

'Criminalizing behavior, if it’s part of the heritage of this state, is 
in my opinion a bad idea. A bad idea. I will not support it,' Bevin can be heard saying in the video.

A Kentucky news station released video on Thursday night of Kentucky Senate candidate Matt Bevin, pictured here in October, at a pro-cockfighting rally saying he would 'not support' future efforts to criminalize the blood-sport

Bevin and his campaign had previously acknowledged his presence at the event. However, Bevin denied having knowledge of the pro-cockfighting theme of the rally.

'It wasn’t a cockfighting event, that’s where you all need to start telling the truth about what happened,' Bevin told MSNBC.

'This was a gathering of people talking about states rights. I don’t 
know what they talked about other then the fact that when I was there, I
 talked about my campaign.'

But an undercover video taken by a WAVE 3 News reporter who attended the rally proves that not only did Bevin know he was at a pro-cockfighting rally, he was specifically asked by American Gamefowl Defense Director Dave Devereaux whether he would 'vote to support the effort to legalize gamecock fighting in the state of Kentucky.'

'I support the people of Kentucky exercising their right, because it is 
our right to decide what it is that we want to do, and not the federal 
government’s,' Bevin said before explaining why he would not support criminalization.

When the reporter from the video approached Bevin this week at a campaign event about his comments, Bevin' said, 'I honestly wasn't even paying attention.'

'I was thinking about what I 
was going to say. I don't even remember him saying that.'

Bevin apologized on Friday afternoon for attending the event and insisted that he does not support cockfighting.

'I am genuinely sorry that my attendance at an event 
which, other than my comments, appears to have primarily involved a 
discussion of cockfighting, has created concern on the part of many 
Kentucky voters,' Bevin said in a statement, Politico reports.

'I am not and have never been, a supporter of cockfighting or any other forms of animal cruelty.'

Bevin is running in the Republican primary against Senate Minority leader Mitch McConnell. McConnell was in Indianapolis, Indiana at the National Rifle Association's annual convention when Bevin's campaign imploded on Friday

Bevin is challenging Senate Minority 
Leader Mitch McConnell in next month's Republican primary.

After Corbin, Kentucky newspaper The News Journal
 first broke the Bevin-cockfighting story earlier this month, Bevin 
accused his opponent of making the scandal up to 'distract people.'

'This is what McConnell does, he makes up lies, he spins the fluff, and 
all of it is intended to distract people that aren’t thoughtful enough 
to actually dig under the hood and ask hard questions,' Bevin told MSNBC.

Bevin and his campaign had previously acknowledged the Tea Party Republican's presence at the cockfighting event. However, Bevin denied having knowledge of the pro-cockfighting theme of the rally

McConnell's 
campaign called Bevin a 'pathological liar' in light of Thursday's 
revelation.

'Matt Bevin's
cockfighting episode will go down in history as one of the most disqualifying
moments in Kentucky political history,' McConnell campaign press secretary Allison
Moore said in a statement.

'Twenty years from now, we will all remember the time when the East
Coast con-man thought so little of Kentuckians that he pathologically lied to
us about absolutely everything until an undercover camera caught him red-handed
at a cockfighting rally.'

Polls have shown McConnell leading Bevin by a double-digit margins for months.

In light of Wave 3 News' undercover video, it's difficult to see how Bevin's campaign is not cock a doodle done.

Cockfighting is illegal in every state in the country. It is not a felony in Kentucky, but penalties for 
participating can include a year in jail and a Class A misdemeanor 
conviction. Spectators can expect only modest fines.

Cockfighting is an age-old blood sport -- now 
outlawed -- in which roosters fight to the death, aided by finely honed 
claws and razor-sharp 'spurs' attached to their legs -- all while 
spectators gamble on the outcome

Vicious: Before a cockfight, 
birds' claws are sharpened and 'spurs' -- pointed puncture-weapons -- 
are attached to their legs in order to make their attacks more lethal in
 the ring
