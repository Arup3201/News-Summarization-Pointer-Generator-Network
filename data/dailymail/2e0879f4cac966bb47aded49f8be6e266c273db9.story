A man and woman are missing after a gunman fired shots at a medical office on Tuesday before burning the building to the ground.

The missing man, believed responsible for the shooting, is reportedly a fired maintenance worker.

The woman who has not been found works at the Park Medical Centers as an assistant and reportedly was in a relationship with the man before breaking it off.

Crews dug through the gutted Detroit medical building, searching for two people unaccounted for,Â  Dwane Blackmon, a Detroit police homicide inspector said.

'Initially, what we know is that it 
was an arson fire,' Blackmon said. 'It was started by an individual who 
we believe fired shots prior to the fire being started.'

Investigators were unable to go deep 
into the one-story building, described by tenants as having also have a 
basement, due to fears of the structure's safety.

Heavy construction equipment tore off sections of the building's scorched roof which had not caved in from the blaze.

Blackmon was not able to confirm if there were any victims inside the building.

Names have not been released but Antha 
Williams-Hill said police told her the woman who has yet to be accounted
for is her 30-year-old daughter, Sharita Williams.

She said: 'I've been trying to get in
touch with her since this morning. I turned on the news and saw the 
building and said, ''Oh Lord!'''

The owners of two businesses inside 
Park Medical Centers said they were told by staff that a fired maintenance worker went inside about 9 am Tuesday and waved a gun 
around.

A security guard yelled out that the 
former maintenance worker had taken 'Sharita and is shooting at other 
people in the building,' said Dr Stuart Kirschenbaum, a podiatrist who 
operated his private practice from the building for about 30 years.

'Everyone called the police and we 
started running,' he said. 'And before you knew it, we saw fire coming 
from a clinic down the hall. Then we started seeing smoke coming from 
the end of the building.'

Dr Kim Logan-Nowlin, a clinical 
psychologist, said she was driving in to a 9.10am appointment when a 
member of her staff called and said: 'Kim, the building is on fire. 
They're shooting.'

Dr Logan-Nowlin told reporters that the man seen with the gun was the former maintenance worker.

Williams-Hill said her daughter had 
been working for the past year and a half as a medical assistant at one 
of the Park Medical Centers offices and that she had been in a 
relationship with the building's maintenance worker until recently 
breaking it off.

'He did a lot of stuff and she was 
trying to get away from him,' Williams-Hill said. "She moved to 
Southfield to get away from him.'

Southfield is one of a number of 
inner ring suburbs surrounding Detroit. Police and arson investigators 
were interviewing people who worked in the building and relatives of 
Sharita Williams and Myron Williams.

Blackmon could not confirm whether 
the two had been in a relationship. By 10.30am Tuesday it was clear that
little if anything could be saved from the rapidly burning building.

Kirschenbaum, state boxing 
commissioner from 1981-1992, said a collection of Joe Louis memorabilia 
he kept from the sport likely was destroyed by flame, smoke and water.

Boxing gloves, personal letters and photos were among the items lost, and Kirschenbaum estimated its value at about $100,000.

'It's gone,' he said.
