Manchester United defeated local rivals Bury to progress to the Fourth Round of the FA Youth Cup on Tuesday night.

The Red Devils won the game 1-0 courtesy of Zach Dearnley's strike on 12 minutes as the United youngster latched onto Timothy Fosu-Mensah's through pass and drove the ball past Bury goalkeeper Jack Ruddy.

Man United frontman Marcus Rashford registered the home side's first chance with just three minutes on the clock.
