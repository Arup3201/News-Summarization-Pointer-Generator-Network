Rick Stein, the celebrity chef with a business empire worth more than £30million, has insisted British customers should pay more for the food they eat.

The restaurateur and television presenter called for the cost of food to increase and urged people to 'eat less, moan less and value what we eat more'.

And the 65-year-old dismissed any potential backlash to his remarks, claiming that he was entitled to make them even though he was wealthy.

Food for thought: Television chef Rick Stein, pictured while filming in Spain, says Britons should stop moaning and pay more for what they eat

He made the comments during a radio discussion about whether the cost of food could ever be too low, in the wake of a protest by dairy farmers over cuts to milk prices.

Mr Stein told BBC Radio 4 Today's programme: 'Of course people are going to turn on the likes of me, (other celebrity chefs) Jamie Oliver and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, saying we have got plenty of money and we should not be saying that food should cost more.

'But frankly I think it should cost more. I don’t feel it is a valid argument to say just because I can afford to pay more I should not be saying it.'

The chef said cheap food came at a cost, warning that the lower prices were the more likely it was that animals would be treated cruelly.

He said: 'Simply we should prepare (to pay more) because I don’t think people really understand the implications of something like milk costing more than less.'

Mr Stein added: 'I am afraid we are all complicit in it. It is no good turning around and blaming the supermarkets, we are all to blame.

'We all don’t really value our food enough. I think we should generally eat less, moan less and actually value what we eat more.'

He went on: 'I don't think people stop to realise what it means to get cheap pork, cheap chicken and cheap milk.'

Mr Stein's empire of restaurants, shops and hotels is worth a reported £32million and employs about 450 people.
