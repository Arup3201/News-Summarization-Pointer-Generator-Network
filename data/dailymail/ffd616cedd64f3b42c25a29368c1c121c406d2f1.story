More than a million people watched a video of a couple 'having sex' on Charlton Athletic's football pitch before it was revealed as a publicity stunt.

The footage was uploaded to a Vine account yesterday afternoon and appeared to show a mystery couple in the middle of the club's grounds - The Valley - in south east London.

The clip was captioned by user Showboat Vines as 'Someone broke into The Valley (home of Charlton) and did this in the centre circle! #SextraTime'.

The video of the couple allegedly 'having sex' at the home ground of Charlton Athletic in south east London has gone viral - but it turned out to be a publicity stunt for the club

Stunt: A full version of the video has been released - and it was not shot on Tuesday after all

But after initially denying knowledge of the video, Charlton Athletic has now confessed it was a publicity stunt for a scheme allowing grassroots footballers to score - for real - at the club's ground.

The vine clip was taken from a longer video which has now been uploaded to YouTube and purports to show several CCTV angles of the excited couple sneaking into the ground. 

The video had already prompted debate after fans of Silent Witness claimed it may have been from a deleted scene from the BBC crime drama.

An episode of the crime series filmed at the stadium in January last year features a storyline about a footballer who was linked to a brutal murder of a young woman after a sex tape of him was leaked.

Bleacher Report UK posted on Twitter: 'Could the "Charlton Athletic sex tape" actually be a scene from the TV show Silent Witness?'

While Steve Harrison wrote: 'Did the BBC break a story that Charlton are investigating a couple having sex on the centre spot? Wasn't it filmed for one of their shows?' 

But a PR firm for Charlton - whose officials initially announced they would carry out an investigation - now admit the video was a promotional tool.

Promotion: The video was all to grab attention for a scheme involving grassroots footballers

Not everyone saw the funny side. One fan of the club nicknamed the Addicks fumed: 'We are the Addicks - not the sex addicts!'

It is not the first time a couple have sneaked onto a football pitch to share a moment of passion. 

In 2013, after a Danish Superliga match between Brondby and Randers, which ended goalless, an unknown couple sneaked onto the pitch and started having sex by the centre circle.

Brøndby press officer Mikkel Davidsen reported the incident on his Twitter feed, and an image of the canoodling couple was then posted online.

Further reports have also indicated that the pair's love making failed to last long as the couple were interrupted by the club's security chief, James Mickel Lauritsen, who threw them out of the stadium.

Croatia international Dino Drpic and his wife Nives Celsius also had sex on the centre spot of his club's Zagreb stadium. His national team later beat England 2-0 there in a Euro 2008 qualifier.

In an interview on a Serbian TV chatshow to promote her book 'The Naked Truth', Miss Celsius revealed that the couple had even arranged for friends to leave the floodlights on at the Maksimir Stadium so they could see what they were doing.
