Andy Murray showed his appetite for Davis Cup glory by tucking into four boxes of sushi during Friday's crunch tie against the United States.

The British No 1 was shown on live TV munching on the healthy, high protein snack as he cheered on Great Britain team-mate James Ward on Friday night.

Commentators were impressed with Murray's forehand technique with the chopsticks but fans were less than impressed with a slow motion replay.

Kat Wray tweeted: 'Did the @bbc really just show Andy Murray eating sushi in slow motion? I mean, REALLY? Good old licence fee. Would hate to have missed that.'

Vici Royle said: 'Well done, @BBCSport, that slow-mo replay of Murray's Sushi forehand was fantastic.'

An emotional Ward finally clinched his sixth match point to sensationally beat the world No 20 6-7, 5-7, 6-3, 7-6, 15-13.
