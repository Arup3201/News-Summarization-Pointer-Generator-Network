Not content with breaking its own previous altitude records, an incredible video of Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo reveals the latest test flight also managed to smash through the sound barrier.

The video, taken by cameras placed on carrier plane WhiteKnightTwo, show SpaceShipTwo reaching its maximum velocity of Mach 1.4, approximately 767mph at sea level. Any speeds faster than Mach 1 are considered supersonic.

The test at Mojave Air and and Space Port in California was designed to simulate a flight into outer space that will go into effect later this year.

During its third test flight in California earlier this year, Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo, pictured, reached a top speed of Mach 1.4. This is approximately 767 mph at sea level, and helped the craft reach an altitude of 71,000ft above the Mojave Air and Space Port in California

Virgin Galactic eventually wants to host commercial space tours.

SpaceShipTwo reached its maximum velocity of Mach 1.4, which is equivalent to approximately 767mph at sea level.

The speeds during this third test flight
 also helped the aircraft reach an altitude of 71,000ft.

The flight 
prior to this test reached 69,000ft.

Pilot Dave MacKay successfully 
piloted the aircraft and returned it safely back to Earth. Following the
 flight he said the experience was a 'dream come true.' This is the 
first flight in which a Virgin Atlantic pilot sat in the cockpit.

Cameras
 mounted on SpaceShipTwo, including one mounted on a tail boom, captured various angles and views of the rocket soaring into the sky.

Virgin
 Galactic also included a rear-facing camera on SpaceShipTwo that showed
 the trail of smoke as the aircraft reached new heights.

Scaled Composites test pilot Mark Stucky was beside Mackay in the cockpit.

Meanwhile,
 Virgin Galactic's Mike Masucci and Scaled's Mike Alsbury were at the 
controls of SpaceShipTwo's mothership, WhiteKnightTwo.

During the first part of the test flight, SpaceShipTwo was tucked beneath twin-fuselage WhiteKnightTwo.

This particular test was meant to 
monitor the thermal coating on the tail of the spacecraft as well as the
 ship's control system that helps the pilot make his way out of outer 
space, and give space tourists the best views.

Together the planes took off at 7:20 
am PT and rose to 46,000ft. After 46,000ft, the pilots unhooked 
SpaceShipTwo for a rocket blast.

The plane is then shown coasting in the sky following the burn before the 
pilots positioned its wings to ensure a stable descent.

Minutes

 later, once the wings were straight, the plane landed on Mojaves 
12,000ft runway with WhiteKnightTwo landing minutes afterwards.

SpaceShipTwo is seen here moments before ignition of her hybrid rocket motor, as seen from carrier plane WhiteKnightTwo. Virgin Galactic eventually wants to host commercial space tours with Katy Perry and Justin Bieber said to have already bought tickets worth $250,000 (£152,000)

'I
 have watched SS2 evolve over the years into an incredible vehicle that 
is going to open up space to more people than ever before,' Mackay said.
 'To be behind the controls and fly it as the rocket ignited is 
something I will never forget. She flew like a champ.'

SpaceShipTwo is a enhanced version of 
SpaceShipOne. The original rocket plane, which won the $10 million Ansari X
 Prize for private spaceflight in 2004 in Mojave, now lives at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum.

'2014 will be the year when we will finally put our beautiful spaceship in her natural environment of space. Today, we had our own Chief Pilot flying another flawless supersonic flight and proving the various systems required to take us safely to space, as well as providing the very best experience while we’re up there,' said Virgin CEO Richard Branson.

Celebrities have already started signing up for the exclusive space tours ready to take off later this year. NBC reports that Katy Perry and Justin Bieber have already signed up. Tickets cost $250,000 (£152,000).

CEO Richard Branson has promised to take a seat on the ship's first flight. Branson hopes to move the passenger flight base to Spaceport America in New Mexico.
