Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal has been given a timely boost ahead of his side's Premier League clash at Arsenal on Saturday, as Angel di Maria, David de Gea, Michael Carrick and Luke Shaw all took part in Friday's training session.

The quartet had all been fitness doubts for the match at the Emirates after picking up injuries playing for their respective countries during the recent international break.

United's club-record £60million signing Di Maria injured his right foot during Argentina's 1-0 friendly defeat to Portugal on Tuesday, while fellow summer acquisition Shaw came off 66 minutes into England's win in Scotland as a precaution after feeling his left hamstring tighten.

Midfielder Carrick had to withdraw from the Three Lions' set-up after hurting his groin, while Spain international De Gea dislocated a finger - but the pair seemed in good spirits at the club's Aon Complex on Friday. 

The duo's jovial mood was reciprocated among Van Gaal's squad with many of the Dutchman's charges seen enjoying themselves as they were put through their paces.

United's position in the table though is no laughing matter with the club seventh in the Premier League and 13 points adrift of table toppers Chelsea after 11 games of the season.

Robin van Persie, who is expected to face a hostile reception when he returns to his former club at the weekend, will be hoping to replicate his international form with Holland after  scoring during the international break.

Old Trafford skipper Wayne Rooney needs one more goal against the Gunners to become the highest Premier League goalscorer against Arsene Wenger's side.

Rooney is currently tied with Liverpool legend Robbie Fowler on 10 league goals against the Gunners with two for Everton and eight for United.

Speaking ahead of Saturday's clash against Arsenal, Rooney believes former team-mate Danny Welbeck did the right thing by swapping Old Trafford for the Emirates in a £16million move this summer.

Many United fans were shocked earlier this year when Van Gaal sanctioned Welbeck's £16million transfer to the north London club.

Welbeck is a life-long United fan and joined the club as an eight-year-old having grown up in the Longsight area of Manchester, which is just four miles away from Old Trafford.

During his 11-year spell at United, Rooney watched the pacy forward progress from teenage prodigy to first-team striker and admits it will be strange to play against the 23-year-old striker when the two sides meet on Saturday.

'Of course, Danny has been here all of his life,' Rooney told MUTV. 'He is a Manchester lad so it is weird seeing him [there]. But that's football nowadays and players move on.'

Welbeck started the vast majority of games on United's successful tour of the United States, however he struggled to get in the starting line-up soon after the season began, with Van Gaal claiming his goal-scoring record was not good enough.

Welbeck scored 29 times in 142 United appearances, but since his move he has found the net on 10 occasions for club and country.

Rooney, who played alongside Welbeck for England against Slovenia and Scotland in the recent international break, thinks leaving United has been beneficial for his former team-mate.

'I think, for Danny, and for his own personal career, it was probably the best move for him,' Rooney said.

'He's done great and scored a few goals and is playing well. Danny gives you what he always gives you - a good shift. He works hard for the team.

'At times, as I said to him, he works a bit too hard but he's scoring goals and he's doing well.'

Arsenal against United has been one of the biggest fixtures on the calendar in recent years, but neither side is considered a serious title contender this season.

For Rooney, the fixture still brings back fond memories, though.

'We've had some great memories,' the England captain added. Beating them in the Champions League semi-final (in 2009) was probably the highlight.'

The same fixture last year ended in a dull 0-0 draw, but given the poor defensive record of both teams, it is unlikely the scoreline will be the same this season.

Rooney is hoping United can strike early against their opponents and is expecting a tough match.

'It's always a tight game and whoever gets the first goal normally wins or gets a result,' the 29-year-old said.

'We have to go there with a good team shape and a good unit to make sure we do everything right.

'Arsenal have got a good squad, an exciting squad with a lot of young players and a lot of English players which is great for England. We know they play with a lot of energy and we'll have to be at our best to beat them.'
