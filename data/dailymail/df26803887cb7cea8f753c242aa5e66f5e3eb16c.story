Within days of Cangrande’s death in the 14th century, rumours began circulating that the Italian ruler had been deliberately poisoned.

And now toxicological tests carried out on the exhumed body of the Lord of Verona claim to have confirmed these historical reports.

Fatal concentrations of digitoxin from the foxglove plant was found in the liver and faeces of the body, and experts believe the most likely explanation was that he was fed the flower surreptitiously.

Researchers from the University of Pisa studied the toxicology of Cangrande's mummified remains. The body was exhumed and unwrapped (left to right) in 2004. During the recent analysis, experts found presence of pollen grains from the poisonous flower foxglove, and toxic levels of digitoxin in liver and faecal samples

The mummy of Can Francesco della Scala, or Cangrande I, was exhumed from its tomb in the church of Santa Maria Antica in Verona in 2004.

It was submitted to a multidisciplinary study, that included archaeological, palaeopathological - the study of ancient diseases - palynological – the study of pollens - toxicological and historical tests.

In the tomb, researchers discovered a well-preserved mummified body (pictured), wrapped in silk. He was on his back with his arms folded

Inside the mummy, researchers discovered a well-preserved body, wrapped in silk.

Cangrande was lying on his back with his arms folded across his chest.

The 5ft 7in (1.7 metre) mummy was initially studied using a CT scanner, which identified regurgitated food in the throat, as well as signs of sinusitis.

Signs of mild arthritis were additionally found in his elbows and hips, along with evidence of cirrhosis and tuberculosis.

Following an abdominal CT scan, the researchers spotted evidence of faeces in the rectum.

Gino Fornaciaria from the University of Pisa carried out the autopsy with sample collection of tissues and a histological study.

The radiological study was performed at the University Hospital of Verona under the supervision of Professor Giuseppe Gortenuti. 

The toxicological study was carried out at the University of Verona under the supervision of Professor Franco Tagliaro.

And the palynological study was performed at a private laboratory by Dr Silvia Marvelli.   

Preliminary analysis found presence of pollen grains from the foxglove flower, known as Digitalis, and traces of camomile and black mulberry.

Toxicological analysis revealed toxic concentrations of digoxin and digitoxin, from Digitalis, in the liver and faecal samples.

Can Francesco della Scala, or Cangrande, was a member of the della Scala family dynasty.

The dynasty dominated Veronese politics from the mid-13th until the end of the 14th century.

Cangrande's reign in Verona began in 1311, and following a number of military campaigns, he added Vicenza and Padua to his empire in 1314 and 1318 respectively.

He was often referred to as the Lord of Verona.

On 18 July 1328 Cangrande, took over the city of Treviso following a long battle to occupy the region of Veneto, in northern Italy. 

He died four days later.

During those four days, Cangrande suffered vomiting and diarrhoea with a fever that, according to written documents, he had contracted a few days before by ‘drinking from a polluted spring’.

But rumours about poisoning began to spread shortly afterwards.

In 2004, Cangrande’s tomb in the church of Saint Maria Antica was opened to allow a paleopathological study to be carried out on the body.

The researchers discovered a well-preserved mummified body, wrapped in silk. Cangrande was lying on his back with his arms folded across his chest.

The 5ft 7in (1.7 metre) mummy was initially studied using a CT scanner, which identified regurgitated food in the throat, as well as signs of sinusitis.

He additionally showed signs of mild arthritis in his elbows and hips, cirrhosis and may have suffered from tuberculosis.

Following an abdominal CT scan, the researchers found evidence of faecal matter in the rectum, which formed the basis for the recent toxicological tests.

The researchers added that gastrointestinal symptoms spotted during the autopsy ‘were compatible with the early phase of Digitalis intoxication and the hypothesis of poisoning is mentioned by some local historical sources.’

The study continued that palaeopathological analysis also confirmed Digitalis poisoning and concluded that the tests suggest the Digitalis was administered orally, and that ‘the most likely hypothesis on the causes of death is that of a deliberate administration of a lethal amount of Digitalis.’

Foxglove poisoning occurs from ingesting the flowers or eating the seeds, stems, or leaves of the foxglove plant - known as Digitalis.

It can also occur from overdosing on medicines made from foxglove, typically used for heart conditions.

The poisonous ingredients include deslanoside, digitoxin and digitalis glycoside.

Symptoms include blurred vision, hallucinations, fainting and headaches.

This turns into stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, and diarrhoea as well as drowsiness. 

Although it is not known who would have fed Cangrande the flower, it has been speculated as someone who objected to his reign, and could have been a leader or member of an opposition military faction.

Put simply, the experts believe Cangrande was deliberately poisoned by being fed foxglove surreptitiously.

Although, they did explain that Cangrande could have mistakenly eaten the flower, along with the other plants found in his remains. 

Other co-authors include Franco Tagliaro, Federica Bortolotti, Rossella Gottardo, Giorgio Brocco from the University of Verona.
