A group of Australian filmmakers spent 15 hours on the ultimate boys trip - travelling to 24 Sydney beaches across the space of a day.

The idea for the video voyage was spawned when a friend of the four-strong production team turned 28, and celebrated by visiting 28 beaches in one day.

From Maroubra Beach, in Sydney's east, to Palm Beach, in the north, the group were lucky when the clouds blew away - leaving clear blue skies and sunshine in their wake.

Rocky start: The video opens with rough waves crashing against a rock cliff at one of the many iconic beaches featured in the video

Southernmost point of the expedition: The furthest south the four member production team went was Maroubra Beach, the most southern surfing beach in Sydney's eastern suburbs

Chilling in Summer Bay: The expedition ended at Sydney's Palm Beach, the setting for the popular long-running soap opera Home And Away

'We wanted to show off Sydney and its beaches as best we could,' The Runaways Production House co-founder and managing director, Alex Dann, told Daily Mail Australia.

'We decided on 24 beaches, because we figured that was the most we could fit in during one day.'

When asked about snubbing the beaches south of Maroubra, in Sydney's Sutherland Shire, Mr Dann was hopeful for The Runaways future endeavours: 'Next time, we'll try and get 31.'

Rising with the sun: The first dip into the ocean of the day came as the sun was rising

The production team arrived at the beach so early, that council workers were still cleaning the sand

'Growing up in Sydney, the beach has always been around and there are such amazing beaches here - we just wanted to show that off,' Mr Dann said.

'I think Palm Beach was probably my favourite, because it marked the end of a very long day,' he said.

'It was very rewarding to get there and have a beer.'

On his favourite beach of the 24 visited, Mr Dann was quick to name Little Manly.

'I really enjoyed Little Manly, which was one of the ones I'd never visited before,' Mr Dann said.

'It was a great little beach that I'd never heard of to be honest.'

Messing about: A poodle was one of the few beachgoers at this bayside northern Sydney gem

Carved in cement: A statue, with eastern Sydney gang The Bra Boys' catchphrase 'My Brothers Keeper', can be seen in the video 

Beachside street art: A graffiti mural of an owl was used in an interest way to transition to another beachside locale 

On what exciting videos viewers can be looking forward to in the future, Mr Dann said The Runaways team have an action-packed start for 2015.

'Next year we have a few trips lined up,' he said.

'We're very passionate about travel videos and adventuring, so we've got a few trips lined up in a few countries that we're hoping to release around mid-next year.'

Production of the video took five days, with one day spent shooting it and four days of post-production.

Impressively, the postcard-style graphics were put into the video five hours before it was uploaded to user-generated video website Vimeo.

'We wanted to make sure we got it out in time for Summer - so everyone could see it,' Mr Dann said.

Well wishes: The Runaways Production House ended the video by wishing viewers a happy summer - with their video no doubt encouraging some viewers to get out and explore Sydney's beaches
