Two sisters adopted by different parents 65 years ago have finally been reunited thanks to endless internet searches.

Ann Bodyfelt, 70, from Oregon, flew to meet her long-lost sibling Karen Simpton, 66, last Thursday at her home in California and the emotional reunion was caught on camera by the Auburn Journal.

When Mrs Bodyfelt clapped eyes on Mrs Simpton for the first time she exclaimed through tears: 'You've grown up . . .  You were three months old when I saw you.'

Meanwhile Mrs Simpton replied: 'Look at you, you look just like me. I always wanted a big sister and I got her now.'

The two last saw each other in March 1949.

Mrs Simpton had been searching for her big sister since the late 1990s but all aveneues had failed.

However, in February just out of intrigue, she typed her
 birth name, 'Beverly Jean Jolly', into Google and 
was shocked to see an appeal made in 2000 for 
someone with that name to get in touch.

From there, Mrs Simpton was able to track down Mrs Bodyfelt and left a message on her home phone.

Recalling the chain of events, Mrs Bodyfelt told Today.com: 'There was a light blinking on the answering machine.

'Never
 give up. For us, there was some divine intervention 
after years of searching and we connected'

'I reached over and hit the button and it said "I think you're my sister." I knew instantly that we had finally found her.'

Mrs Bodyfelt returned the call and the sisters found that they had an instant connection.

'Ever since she called we've been talking, it's like we've never been apart,' Mrs Bodyfelt said.

She and her brother Skip Westerling were left at an orphanage in Portland, Oregon, more than six decades ago, but Mrs Simpton, at three months old, was too young to be given up.

Instead, she stayed with her parents for another few months and was eventually taken in by a San Francisco couple.

She remained on the West Coast and is now retired in Christian Valley 
with her husband, Mike.

It is unclear what happened to the 
sisters’ parents, but an older half-brother and an older stepsister, who
 have since died, were sent off to be raised by their grandparents in 
the Midwest.

Mrs Simpton and Mrs Bodyfelt now plan on staging a reunion with 
their brother, Skip Westerling.

The two sisters agree that perseverance is key to finding a missing relative or loved one.

Mrs Simpton concluded: 'Never
 give up. For us, there was some divine intervention 
after years of searching and we connected. When it happens, it’s the 
right time.

'It’s going to be a whole new 
adventure. We’re discovering similarities and differences. 
This is just the beginning. It’s still like a miracle.'
