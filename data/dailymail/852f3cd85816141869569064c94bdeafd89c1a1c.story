Two JetBlue pilots have managed to land their aircraft safely after a blinding green laser was aimed at their cockpit as they flew near a Florida airport on Monday night.

The pilots touched down at Palm Beach International Airport around 7pm after the laser hit their window, according to the Federal Aviation Administration and the Palm Beach County Sherriff’s office.

The plane was heading for the airport after taking off from New York's LaGuardia Airport.

'Thankfully they were able to land the jet safely,' the sheriff’s office said in a statement.

'There has been an ongoing problem with the misuse of a green laser that has been pointed into the cockpits of aircrafts landing at PBIA.'

The laser, likely from a small laser pen, was pointed at the cockpit from the ground, according to Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office.

Deputies
launched a search by land and air after the pilots reported the laser but have not yet found the people responsible, Teri Barbera, sheriff spokeswoman, told WPTV.

The sheriff's office warned that anyone who knowingly points the 
beam of a laser device on someone operating a vehicle, 
vessel or aircraft resulting in bodily injury is guilty of a 
second-degree felony.

Safe: The JetBlue plane landed - but authorities warned that the consequences could have been deadly

Targeted: The incident occurred at the Palm Beach Airport, which has seen a spate of laser incidents

If the plane had crashed following the incident, this would have become a first-degree felony.

Other cities had recently reported an increase in lasers.

From January 1 to November 15 of this year, 36 laser incidents were reported in the Palm Beach and Boca Raton area, NBC reported.

It added that 279 incidents were reported overall in Florida and 3434 were reported nationwide, according to the FAA. The number of incidents has increased 17 per cent since last year.
