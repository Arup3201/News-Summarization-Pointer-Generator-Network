A formerly greedy greengrocer who was too fat to lift a crate of vegetables has lost the equivalent of three sacks of potatoes in weight - and has worn a skirt for the first time in 15 years

And mother-of-two Claire Robinson, did it all by taking her own sales advice and swapping greasy takeaways for the healthy fruit and vegetables sold in her shop.

Claire, 39, who lives in Louth, Lincolnshire, with her husband Chris, 44, and their children Ryan, 15, and Amber, 13, lost five stone and dropped four dress sizes in just nine months, bringing her weight down to a healthy 11st 11lbs.

The super-slimmer decided to lose the weight when her hefty diet of 4,000 calories per day resulted in her tipping the scales at 16-and-a-half-stone, and she was getting out of breath just carrying crates of produce around her shop.

With the help of Slimming World, Claire threw out junk food and takeaways, and instead began munching her way through her own stock in the family-run business. She also started going to the gym at least four times a week.

She said: 'I am turning 40 this year and I didn't want to be a frumpy, middle-aged mum. I was always conscious of my weight and would never get in a swimming costume.

'At work, I found myself getting tired quite easily and struggling to lug around heavy sacks of potatoes. So I decided I had to do something about it - for both my professional and personal life.

'Through Slimming World I was able to literally eat unlimited amounts of fruit and vegetables - which is obviously on tap at my place.

'There's no calorie counting involved, so you just cut out things like dairy, cereal and bread. I replaced that with all the fruit and veg lying around the shop and it's done the job.

'Luckily I haven't munched my way into the profits - there's plenty to go around.'

And as a result of her huge weight loss, Claire has been forced to spend hundreds of pounds on a new wardrobe because her XL clothes no longer fit her.

She added: 'Our family eat together now at the table, at reasonable times instead of grabbing hit and miss meals.

'Being able to choose and buy clothes from normal shops has made shopping a pleasure rather than a chore. Last week was the first time I've worn a skirt in 15 years.'

Claire - who wants her weight loss to 
top five stone by her 40th birthday in January - has now been nominated 
to take part in Slimming World's Woman of the Year competition for 2012.
