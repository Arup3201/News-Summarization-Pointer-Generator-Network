With his prim manner and somewhat geeky image, Michael Gove may seem an unlikely candidate for eyebrow-raising student antics such as tussles with a love rival and ‘a five-in-a-bed romp shocker’.

Reports from a student newspaper give an extraordinary insight into the Scots minister’s colourful past at Oxford in the 1980s, where he studied English and became president of the Union.

One report in the Cherwell newspaper, bearing the lurid headline ‘Union hacks in five-in-a-bed romp shocker’, claimed Mr Gove and two other male students ended up in bed with two women after a ball.

Colourful antics: Michael Gove with his parents Christine and Ernest before he started university at Oxford

‘Since the evening in question there have been many tight-lipped “no comments” about what they all got up to,’ the newspaper said in a 1988 report.

Mr Gove, who was born in Edinburgh and raised in Aberdeen, apparently said he was ‘only seeking comfort after being beaten up in Aberdeen on Boxing Day’.

In another account, Mr Gove, who declined to comment on the reports, is said to have been so overcome by envy towards a love rival he rubbed egg into his hair.

Cherwell referred to Mr Gove’s ‘current macho behaviour’ as he attempted to win back the love of Marianne Gilchrist, who apparently called off their romance as his term as president ended and turned to a second suitor, Duncan Penny.

The paper reported: ‘At a showdown on Friday, Gove’s jealousy got the better of him and he scrambled egg all over Penny’s hair.

‘He [Penny] managed to respond by reaching for his fridge and splattering the Honourable Gentleman with a tomato.’

But the row didn’t end there, said the report.

‘In a fit of Hulkman rage Gove broke into Penny’s room at two in the morning and fire-hosed his sleeping body. Unfortunately Gove somehow was unable to hit the mark and Penny wasn’t aroused...’

Another Cherwell article notes that, while standing for election at the Oxford Union, Mr Gove took to wearing a kilt ‘in a desperate attempt to win the sympathy vote’.

‘But does he wear it like a true Scotsman?... the answer seems to be that Michael leaves his boxer shorts at home.’

The tales were reported in the Sunday Times following revelations last week that Dominic Grieve,  the Attorney General, was part of a gang which threw Damian Green – now the police minister – into the Cherwell River.

Mr Green reportedly said he ‘could have drowned’ after almost being impaled on rusty spikes in the river.
