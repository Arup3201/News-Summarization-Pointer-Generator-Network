A long-serving special education teacher is being investigated after sending an offensive email from her work account describing her students as 'maggots' and monkeys'.

Connecticut's Gwendolyn Fenton is on paid leave from Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary School in Hartford after a May email in which she criticized her special needs students was exposed.

'I am having an awful day with the monkeys I am supposed to teach,' Fenton wrote.

'I would have a better time teaching gorillas to sign than this maggets (sic).'

Shocking: Teacher Gwendolyn Fenton used her work email to complain that her students were 'monkeys' and 'maggots'

Fenton admitted she sent the email - obtained exclusively by FOX CT through an open records request - out of frustration.

'I’m embarrassed. That’s not who I am.

'I don’t know how it was given to you but it is not what the district 
expects of me and not what I expected for myself,' she told FOX CT.

'It was out of a level of frustration.

'I referred to them inappropriately. That is not the kind of person that I am.'

Hartford district spokesman David 
Medina said Fenton has been placed on administrative leave with pay 
while she is being investigated.

Fenton has worked at numerous schools for special needs students in Hartford over several decades.

Assistant Child Advocate Mickey Kramer from the State’s Office of the Child Advocate slammed the teacher's comments.

'I feel sick that any school person and educator, particularly a special educator would ever, ever, express such a thought about children,' Kramer told FOX CT.

Defensive: Former student Devon Palmer backed Fenton, saying it was common for teachers to complain about students

However student Devon Palmer defended Fenton, insisting it's common for teachers to complain about students as behavior problems are so widespread.

'She’s a very wonderful teacher. She’s wonderful,' he said.

'I didn’t know she would write something like that but I can honestly think that she would say something like that because she gets mad.

'Those students I remember one time, they almost jumped her.'

However this is not the first time Fenton has come under fire.

In August 1995, The Courant reported she had been charged with marijuana possession in June after intercepting a package in the mail.

Police dropped the charges due to alack of evidence and she was allowed to keep working at the Oak Hill School, a program run by the Connecticut Institute for the Blind.
