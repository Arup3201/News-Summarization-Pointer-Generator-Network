A former pitching coach at The University of Miami allegedly injected a minor athlete with the same human growth hormone supposedly given to suspended New York Yankee player Alex Rodriguez 'A-Rod'.

Lazaro 'Lazer' Daniel Collazo, 50, is charged with conspiracy to distribute testosterone and human growth hormone (HGH) to Major League Baseball (MLB) players and high school athletes.

An indictment filed on Thursday states that Collazo injected a minor with HGH in June of 2012 and ordered HGH twice, once in 2011 and 2012 also for distribution to a minor, reports NBC.

Charged: Lazaro 'Lazer' Daniel Collazo, 50, is charged with conspiracy to distribute testosterone and human growth hormone (HGH) to Major League Baseball (MLB) players and high school athletes

Suspended: Alexander Rodriguez 'A-Rod' is one of 14 Major and minor league baseball players suspended in connection to the HGH Biogenesis clinic investigation

Collazo supposedly acquired the HGH from the Biogenesis anti-aging clinic founded by Anthony Bosch.

Bosch has plead guilty and is cooperating with the feds.

The New York Daily News reports that Collazo posted a $50,000 bond last week, wasn't jailed, and is free unless he violates any of the bond conditions.

During the U.S. Attorney's press conference on August 5, Prosecutor Wifredo Ferrer labelled Collazo 'a customer of Bosch's who recruited high school athletes and other individuals.'

The Drug Enforcement Administration special agent Mark Trouville added that Collazo represented a 'particularly disturbing part of this investigation.'

'He utilized his close to 30 years involvement in South Florida baseball. He used these connections to actively recruit underage high school athletes for Mr. Bosch,' said Trouville.

Collazo is one of four men from South Florida, including the cousin of Alex Rodriguez, charged in a superseding indictment filed on Thursday in Miami, announced the Attorney for the Southern District of Florida today.

Alex Rodriguez's cousin, 52-year-old Yuri Sucart, along with Juan Carlos Nunez, 48, and Paulo Berejuk, 50, are all charged in the indictment.

NBC reports that Berejuk was denied bond in a federal court on Thursday.

The Drug Enforcement Administration said that Berejuk made performance-enhancing drugs in his garage and supplied Bosch with it for several years. 

Bosch has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with investigators, including providing key information to the DEA about Berejuk's involvement.

Collazo’s attorney, Frank Quintero Jr., said he spoke with a prosecutor who said that the government has no evidence that Collazo provided performance-enhancing drugs.

Collazo left the University of Miami in 2003 after nearly 18 years with the Hurricanes.

A-Rod is one of 14 Major and minor league baseball players suspended in connection to the investigation.
