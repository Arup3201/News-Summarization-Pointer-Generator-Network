A scientist who was gored by a stag in the Scottish Highlands today said she was 'totally lucky to be alive' after the animal embedded its antler just millimetres from her spinal cord.

Cambridge academic Kate Stone was in a coma for a week following the harrowing attack, which took place as she was walking with friends on a New Year's holiday.

Two months later, the 44-year-old has still not been able to return to work, and can only eat and drink using a tube.

'Lucky to be alive': Scientist Kate Stone has talked about the ordeal of being gored in the neck by a stag

The
 attack took place outside Dr Stone's holiday home in Lochailort in the 
early hours of December 30 while she was returning from a night out in 
the dark. 

The deer was panicking after being trapped in the garden, and when it crashed into Dr Stone it gored her throat. 

She was airlifted from the scene to hospital in Glasgow, put in an induced coma for a week and underwent two operations on her throat.  

Two months later, Dr Stone - who runs a technology company in Cambridge after leaving her university job - is still recovering at her sister's home in Dundee.  

She said she was 'still only realising the magnitude of what's happened' as she recalled walking through the garden gate then 'a massive thud... and then a second thud'.

She added: 'I shouted for my friends to come over. At first they thought I was joking, but they could tell by the way I was gurgling, rather than speaking, and my neck was all cut open - it became clear I couldn't breathe or speak properly.'  

In the immediate aftermath of the attack, Dr Stone felt no pain because she had gone into shock, and concentrated on staying alive while she waited for help to arrive.  

'A friend told me to focus on breathing so I remained very calm and I just did one breath in, one breath out,' she said. 'And that's what I did for about 40 minutes.'  

Doctors told her that the stag's antler went through her trachea and oesophagus, damaging her vocal cords and fracturing her neck, before hitting her spine.  

'I'm told it stopped just a few millimetres from my spinal cord,' she said. 'I'm also told that if it had been slightly to the left of the right I would have bled to death at the scene.  

'My injuries were life-threatening, absolutely, and it's so strange for me to realise that.'  

Recovery: The Cambridge academic hopes to be able to return to work in the next two or three months 

After leaving hospital, Dr Stone was unable to write, walk or talk properly, and still needs a tube to eat and drink.  

'I'm totally lucky to be alive,' she said. 'I feel like I've gained nearly everything back, kind of from the brink of death.  

'It could be a life-changing experience but it confirms how I already feel about so many things. I tell people I meet, "Life is short and at any moment something can happen us."  

'I always thought it would be a car accident - I think a stag accident is much more my style.'  

Dr Stone hopes to return to Novalia, the hi-tech print company she founded after leaving Cambridge University's Institute of Manufacturing, within two or three months.
