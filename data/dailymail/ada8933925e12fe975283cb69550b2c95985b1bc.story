A 68-year old resident of a Sumpter County, Florida 55-and-over retirement community was arrested along with her much younger toyboy, 49, for allegedly having drunken sex in the the community's town square.

Residents of Lake Sumter Landing, one of the squares in the retirement community, called police and reported seeing Margaret Ann Klemm, 68, and David Bobilya, 49, engaging in sexual intercourse at 10:30 PM on June 2.

The Smoking Gun reports that when investigators arrived at the scene, Klemm had her shirt pulled down and wasn't wearing any pants.

Margaret Ann Klemm, 68, faces charges for public indecency and intoxication after allegedly having sex with her 49-year-old lover outside at her retirement community

David Bobilya, 49, was arrested along with Klemm for allegedly having sex in public

Bobilya's pants and underwear were pulled down all the way to his ankles.

Police say that Klemm and Bobilya both seemed to be intoxicated but that they followed police officers' orders and put their clothing back on.

Both face charges for public intoxication and indecent exposure.

Klemm and Bobilya both were booked and jail on misdemeanor counts but were released on $1500 bail.

Just four days before the alleged public sex romp, Klemm finished settling a prior criminal case.

Back in April Klemm pleaded guilty to a DUI charge after she was caught drunk driving in a golf cart.

The Smoking Gun reports that The Villages retirement community calls itself 'Florida's Friendliest Retirement Hometown.'

Residents are not permitted to engage in 'friendly' naked behavior in public, however.
