Boxer-turned-terrorist Mohamed Elomar is believed to have married fellow Australian Khaled Sharrouf's 14-year-old daughter. 

The girl's Twitter profile lists her 'zawji', Arabic for 'husband', as Abu Hafs Al Australi who is 17 years her senior.

Abu Hafs Al Australi is the name used by Mohamed Elomar who fled to Syria to fight with Islamic State.

The girl also seems to have a close association with the widows of 'Playboy Jihadi' Mahmoud Abdullatif and Suhan Rahman who have recently died while fighting for the terror group.

This revelation comes as a chilling new photograph of a young boy believed to be Sharrouf's son - and brother of the 14-year-old 'bride' - appeared on her social media site.

The picture shows two children sitting in front of an Islamic State flag.

Both are smiling and have rifles propped up next to them as they salute the camera. 

One of the children is believed to be Sharrouf's son.

While the other boy is thought to be a Yazidi slave. 

This photo appeared on the girl's social media profile and features her younger brother. It is not clear who is her brother and who is the Yazidi slave

The girl asked God to protect her younger brother 'from all evil' on her social media account

One of the boys, who is holding a knife, also appears in the Twitter profile photo of 'Playboy Jihadi' Mahmoud Abdullatif's widow Zehra Duman

Sharrouf posted a photo last year of his son holding up a severed head, causing international uproar 

The caption read: 'Young cubs of ISIS [Islamic State of Iraq and Syria], may Allah (swt) protect them from all evil.'

ISIS is another name for the terror group, IS.

One of the children - who in a different photo appears to be holding a knife with a rifle in the background in the profile picture of 'Playboy Jihadi' Mahmoud Abdullatif's widow Zehra Duman - seems to be a poster child for the extremist organisation.

The latest photo has been posted after an active few days on Twitter for a group of Australian jihadists who are believed to have fled to the Middle East to fight with IS militants.

Elomar also goes by the name of Abu Hafs Al Australi. The Sydney boxer fled to Syria to join IS

Mahmoud Adullatif, who is known as the 'Playboy Jihadi', died recently while fighting for IS

Zehra Duman (pictured above) was married to Abdullatif and has threatened Australia

The wife of Australian terrorist Suhan Rahman (above) also urged people to look up U.S. president Barack Obama's White House schedule and 'take down that treacherous tyrant'

Just days ago, both Zehra Duman and the wife of Suhan Rahman made threats to Australia and Tony Abbott.

'Tony Abbott, I suggest u pin back ur ears, we're cumn to get u. And ur family. And the likes of u. Yous are not safe, even if yous think so,' Duman tweeted.

Duman also warns that support for IS is growing 'within ur schools, work places, streets and r closer to u thn wat u think. Allah promised us victory and we will surely get it'.

Meanwhile, the wife of Suhan Rahman called on supporters to send money to help the IS cause.

Zumarul Jannah also urged people to look up U.S. president Barack Obama's White House schedule and 'take down that treacherous tyrant'. 

The same brown-eyed boy (front) appeared in another photo posted last year on Sharrouf's Twitter accounts

'If you can send money to the Mujahideen [jihadis] here and you are able to assist a fighter dm me and send as much as you are able to,' the widow wrote.

'If you can't come here then terrorise the kuffar at home. Form and expand the Khilafah where you are.'

Both Abdullahtif and and Rahman are believed to have died while fighting with IS.

As a tribute to Rahman, Zumarul Jannah posted a photo of her husband's dead body last week with the caption: 'And never think of those who have been killed in the cause of Allah as dead.'
