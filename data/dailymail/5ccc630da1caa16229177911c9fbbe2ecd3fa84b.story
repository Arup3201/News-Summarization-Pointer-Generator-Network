It’s the perfect image for reality TV stars from Essex or a footballer’s WAG.

But the deep bronzed or orange fake tan look isn’t just popular with wannabe stars keen to catch the eye of the paparazzi and stand out from the crowd.

For young women across the country are buying the darkest shade of tan by the bucketful to splash on for nights out.

Tan fans: Sales of Solait Dark Tan have soared and were particularly high in February

New sales figures show that half the fake tan sold by a major national retailer was the darkest shade available.

The concentrated mahogany-coloured potion contains double the amount of chemicals to the previous deepest shade on sale.

And it has proved a huge hit since its launch last April.

Solait Dark Tan now accounts for 50 per cent of all fake tans sold at Superdrug and it outsells light tans by three to one.

Women
keen to emulate the style of reality TV stars Kim Kardashian and Amy 
Childs are not shy about transforming their white skin to a much darker 
shade.

Sales were said to have hit record levels
in February, with the fake tan being seen as a perfect antidote to the 
cold mid-winter weather.

Previously the dark tan effect was 
exclusively available by going to a beauty salons, and was not available
for purchase on supermarket shelves.

Simon Comins, the buying director of Superdrug, said: ‘Kim’s deep-tanned skin is the shade our customers are aiming for.’ 

To cash-in further on the fake tan trend, the company has also launched a £4.99 ‘wash off’ dark tan for girls who want to looked bronzed for a night out but need to return to normal for work the following day.

Fake tan sales are worth £100 million a year in the UK and are the fastest growing area for cosmetic sales. A third of women and one in ten of men admit to using it.
