A  33-year-old father-of-six suspected of killing his wife and their neighbor before going to a church and shooting their pastor dead has been caught and is in custody. 

Andres 'Andy' Avalos is said to have started his killing spree in the city of Bradenton, around 45 miles south of Tampa Bay, on Thursday afternoon.

Detectives were called to the Bayshore Baptist Church where they found father-of-two James 'Tripp' Battle, 31, dead in the courtyard. 

Authorities were then led to a home nearby where they discovered the bodies of Amber Avalos, 33, the suspect's wife of 15 years, and neighbor Denise Potter, 45.

Victims: Amber Avalos, 33, the suspect's wife, and pastor of Bayshore Baptist Church in Bradenton, Florida, James 'Tripp' Battle, 31, were killed during a shooting spree on Thursday

Wanted: Police are now searching for Andres 'Andy' Avalos who was last seen at the church where Mr Battle was found dead. He was married to Amber for 20 years and the pair had six children together

Investigators with the Manatee County Sheriff's Office say Avalos, whose father is a minister, was last seen near the church driving a gold Chevrolet Suburban. 

The car was found at a Walmart 11 miles away from the church on Friday.

They believe he was under the influence of drugs during the attacks.

'We don't know exactly what transpired,' said sheriff's spokesman Dave Bristow. However he added that the incident had stemmed from a 'domestic situation' and wasn't random. 

When asked if it was a crime of passion, Bristow told reporters it was a 'possibility'.  

His wife Amber was the children's director at the church while two of Potter's sons, aged 14 and seven, also worked there.

According to the Bayshore Baptist website Mr Battle and his wife, Joy, who is the church's secretary, have a five-year-old daughter and a two-year-old son.

The pastor is also believed to have counselled the suspect while he was having problems with his marriage. Mr Battle's father Jimmy told the Tampa Bay Times that he believed Avalos was paranoid and began suspecting every man that walked pass his wife. 

Sheriff Brad Steube said Battle and Avalos met face-to-face in the church courtyard shortly before the shooting.

Killed: Police also found the body of 45-year-old Denise Potter, who lived next to the suspect and his wife

'The pastor saw this coming, they were facing each other' he told the newspaper.

Leslie Howell, who had been renting the home out to the family for the last three years, said she had vague suspicions the couple were having problems because of the poor condition of the home.

One of Amber Avalos' sisters, who lived in the same home with her three children, arrived at the scene shortly after police. 

She said the couple had been together for more than 20 years but suggested Avalos had substance abuse problems.

She said: 'He's crazy, he's psychotic. He takes drugs and he drinks a lot.'

Patrick Duff, her partner, said that Mrs Avalos had left her husband a couple of months before but he had returned home. 

Judy Smith, a friend of the family, told the Sarasota Herald Tribune that Alavos loved his children but was 'sick' and had a lot of problems.  

As news of the deaths broke, the devastated church community tried to unite and support the families of the victims.  

'We have to be strong for Joy,' church member Linda Stewart told the Bradenton Herald. 'I don't know how she will get through this.'  

E.W 'Karp' Carpenter, a member of the church since the 1950s, told the newspaper that Battle 'was a great pastor,' and that the church's congregation grew from 30 to more than 100 under his stewardship.

'He was 31 years old and would give you shirt off his back,' Carpenter said.

Family: Mr Battle and his wife, Joy, (pictured) who is the church's secretary, have a five-year-old daughter and a two-year-old son

Cause: Authorities believe that Avalos (pictured with wife Amber) was not acting randomly and the deadly incident stemmed from a domestic situation 

Marking: Police have released a close-up of a tattoo on the murder suspect's neck which says 'RIP Carnallo'

Tragic: Mrs Avalos was the children's director at the church and had lived in the city all her life. Her sister claimed that her husband, who is now on the run, had problems with substance abuse and was 'psychotic' 

Jane Riley, a neighbor of the Avalos family, told The Associated Press that the neighborhood near the Manatee River is 'like the sweetest little community,' although she did point out that in 2008, a previous tenant of the Avaloses' home was slain during a home invasion.

'Now I'm scared,' said Riley. 'I have an alarm system, but is that enough? I hope the cops hang around for a while.'

Investigators say Avalos should be considered dangerous. Anyone who sees him should call police.

Four schools were put on lockdown following the shootings, fearing Avalos would try and pick up one of his six children. 

Avalos has several previous arrests; among are five in Hillsborough County. The most recent was on a DUI charge in 2012. 

According to the Herald, he was also shot in the arm during an altercation with another man in 2003.

He held a gun to his head and during a following argument, the weapon went off.
