Argentina take over Brazil’s famous Corinthians Stadium on Tuesday night and star striker Lionel Messi has set aside the national rivalry by posing with a shirt with the message ‘Welcome to the Arena Corinthians’.

Messi and Co take on Switzerland in Sau Paulo, a city synonymous with the Brazilian national team, and the atmosphere promises to be white hot.

Rivalry between the two major footballing nations in South America goes back decades, but Messi was not afraid to pose with a shirt of Brazil's giants.

It will be a homecoming of sorts for Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella who was assistant to Daniel Passarella at Corinthians in 2005 in a disastrous spell that lasted just two months.

Argentina stars such as Javier Mascherano and Carlos Tevez have played for Corinthians in the past.
