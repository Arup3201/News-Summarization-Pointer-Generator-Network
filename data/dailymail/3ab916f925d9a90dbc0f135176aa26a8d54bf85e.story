A Canadian model claims rapper Kanye West cheated on pregnant girlfriend Kim Kardashian after they met at one of his shows.

In stunning claims Leyla Ghobadi, 24, told America's Star magazine that their fling started in July 2012 and continued even after Kim had announced her pregnancy after Kanye dismissed his relationship with the reality star as just 'for publicity and nothing serious'.

Explaining her decision to reveal the relationship, brunette Leyla said: 'This is going to destroy the Kardashian family. It’s bad. It’s really 
bad. It’s just embarrassing. But if I were Kim and about to have a baby,
 I would want to know.'

'If I was Kim and about to have a baby, I'd want to know': Leyla Ghobadi has claimed Kanye cheated on Kim with her

Determined: But Kanye is said to have set his 
sights on the model who bears more than a passing resemblance to Kim, and offered her and her friends backstage passes 
and free tickets to his next gig the following night

Setting his sights on her: It's not hard to see what Kanye reportedly saw in Leyla, a 24-year-old model from Canada

Kim's representatives have denied the reports, while Kanye's added: 'This most recent attack on Kanye West and his family is totally without merit.

'It's a blatant attempt by a misguided individual who is clearly seeking publicity, and another in a series of malicious stories drummed up by non-credible "news" sources.' This is a sad attempt to hurt two people trying to live their lives.'

Kanye is said to have first set his sights on curvy model Leyla when he saw her dancing in the crowd at his show in Atlantic City in July last year.

And despite Kim also being present at the gig in Revel’s Ovation Hall, Kanye reportedly instructed a member of his entourage to seek out Leyla and invite her backstage. 

The rapper is then reported to have invited Leyla for cocktails at AC’s HQ Nightclub, before asking her to come back to his hotel room.

However, Leyla declined, adding to the publication: 'I refused, as I felt it was too rushed.'

Kanye
 then reportedly asked Leyla and her friends, who had driven down from 
Montreal to watch his show, if they wanted to attend the concert the 
next evening, and gave them backstage passes.

And while Leyla admits she knew Kanye was with Kim at the time, she said the 36-year-old musician told her the relationship was 'for publicity and nothing serious'.

Not taking no for an answer: Leyla even alleges that Kanye contacted her this weekend to see if she wanted to meet up but she declined

After agreeing to accompany Kanye back to his hotel room after chatting to him backstage, Leyla said: 'We began to make out for a while - and next thing I knew, we were both naked and having sex.'

The couple's next reported meeting came in October in New York, as Kim, who had not announced her pregnancy at that point, was in Miami.

Leyla even alleges that Kanye contacted her just last weekend to see if she wanted to meet up, but said that at that point she was fully aware of Kim's pregnancy, adding: 'I would never do that to someone.'

As they were: Kanye and Kim looked very much in love as they added the Met Ball together in New York on 6th May

Kim and Kanye announced her pregnancy in December 2012, with Kanye revealing the happy baby news to the crowd during a concert in Atlantic City.

The rapper said 'stop the music', then 
announced 'make noise for my baby mama right here,' with a wide smile.

Kanye and Kim had been dating for eight months at that point, but have been friends for a number of years.

In a lengthy interview he gave to the New York Times to promote his forthcoming album Yeezus, Kanye spoke about his reasons for not participating in Keeping In The Kardashians, his love for Kim and becoming a father.

He said: 'I’m the type of rock star that likes to have a girlfriend, you know? I’m the type of soul that likes to be in love and likes to be able to focus. And that inspires me.

Catching her eye: Leyla alleges that Kanye sent one of his team to ask her backstage after this performance at Revel's Ovation Hall in Atlantic City in July 2012

'You know, the amount of backlash I 
got from it is when I decided to not be on the show anymore. And it’s 
not that I have an issue with the show; I just have an issue with the 
amount of backlash that I get. Because I just see like, an amazing 
person that I’m in love with that I want to help.'

On becoming a father he said his first instinct is to be protective of his baby - and its privacy.

He said: 'I would do anything to 
protect my child or my child’s mother. As simple as that...I just don’t 
want to talk to America about my family. Like, this is my baby. This 
isn’t America’s baby.'

The couple have looked very much in love in recent months as they prepare for the arrival of their first child together.

However,
 their lack of time together in recent weeks has hit headlines, with the
 couple's last outing together coming in mid-May.

But
 Kanye was seen making a brief appearance at Kim's baby shower, which 
was filmed for her reality show, at the beginning of the month.

Far away: Kanye smiled and laughed with friends at his Yeezus listening party in New York City on June 10

Party people: Famous friends Jay-Z and Beyonce Knowles attended the birthday dinner - which Kim was unable to fly to

And RadarOnline have claimed she is 'unhappy' that Kanye continued his plans for a birthday party in New York without her, even though he knew she would not be able to attend.

Kim was reportedly upset that the 'New Slaves' hitmaker celebrated his 36th birthday at a star-studded bash without her in New York City on Saturday.

A source told RadarOnline.com: 'Kim is so close to giving birth and she's big and uncomfortable and knowing Kanye partied with all of their friends really made her mad.'

The party goes on: Top model Joan Smalls and Peter Dundas also attended the listening part for Kanye's new album which is released Monday

The rapper celebrated with his friends including Beyonce, Jay-Z, Nas, Kim's older sister Kourtney Kardashian and her boyfriend, Scott Disick, as well as her best friend Jonathan Cheban at Jamaican restaurant Ms. Lily's, because he was performing at the Governor's Ball in the city on Sunday, but Kim wanted him to delay his party and have it in Los Angeles instead.

The source said: 'She isn't traveling this late in her pregnancy but everyone else there could have easily come to Los Angeles, they all can hop on a private plane any time they want!

'Kim totally respects Kanye and the work he has to do, but as her due date grows closer she is getting mad about how little time they're spending together and wishes that he would try and accommodate her more.'

Stepping out: Kim's mother Kris Jenner was seen out shopping at Fred Segal in Hollywood on Tuesday
