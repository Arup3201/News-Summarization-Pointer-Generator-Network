Friends of the British hostage facing brutal murder by Islamic State fanatics last night said the British Government was 'letting an innocent man die' by refusing to pay a ransom for his release.

While his wife told the Mail she is defiantly refusing to give up hope that David Haines will be rescued, close friends of the couple said his fate has been sealed by the UK's refusal to negotiate with terrorists.

‎Dragana Prodanovic Haines yesterday revealed she is in contact with a team of experts desperately working to try to save her husband.

She ‎is living under police guard at home in Sisak, Croatia, with her mother and the couple's four-year-old daughter.

‎In order to maximise the chance of Mr Haines surviving, she is refusing to talk in detail about his plight with even her closest family and friends, believing any slip ups by her could affect whether he lives or dies.

Despite 'Jihadi John' indicating her husband would be his next victim, Mrs Haines suggested she still has hope he will be saved by a rescue squad.

‎'I don't want to have any contact with anyone who is not involved in working to get my husband free,' she said.

'I cry and I'm helpless. They told me that I can't say anything. I don't want to make his situation worse.'

The wife of another former hostage tried to get in touch with Mrs Haines yesterday to offer some comfort and advice but, fearful of consequences, she said she could not speak.

Mrs Haines said ‎she 'appreciated' the fact that those around her were understanding that she cannot say too much at the moment.

One of her closest friends also told the Mail Mrs Haines is refusing to give up hope that she will be reunited with her husband.

But she criticised the British government for‎ not paying off Islamic State terrorists to save him, as other European countries have done.

Mrs Haines said that her daughter Athea (left), now four, hasn't seen her father for a year and a half, who is being held hostage every day asks about him every day

Mr Haines, an aid worker for 16 years, was captured near Syria’s Turkish border in March 2013 with Italian Federico Motka

'We know Dragana can't tell us what is happening. She is so strong. She will not give up hope that David will be rescued,' the friend said.

'‎She is in shock. She can't understand what is happening to him. I watched the video and I can't believe the UK does nothing to save him from those animals.

'If he was from Italy or France they would pay and he would be back with his beautiful wife and their child.

'The UK and America won't pay ransoms so they are letting an innocent man die‎. Dragana is so in love, I don't know how she copes. Her daughter will grow up with no father.

'It is the worst thing. I watched the video and he is so thin. I can't think about what they are doing to him. What Dragana is going through is the worst thing in the world. He should never have gone there. He is always trying to do good things for work but it is too risky. It is not worth the risk.

'I know people say paying terrorists is bad. But that is politics. This is a real man. How can the UK see this and they do nothing?' 

As Mrs Haines waited with their daughter Athea, four, at home in Croatia, she admitted to being afraid anything she said could influence his fate. She has described him as a ‘fantastic man and father’ who is ‘everything to us’.

Her determined hope is in contrast to the caution of Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond.

Brutal: Mr Haines is said to have been beaten so badly that his kidnappers were forced to arrange medical treatment while he was being held captive 

Mr Haines, 44, was popular in Croatia, where he had worked for aid organisations since 1999

‘We have to be clear about the nature of the organisation we are dealing with,’ he said yesterday. ‘They are utterly brutal, they are ideologically driven, almost pathological.’

He said ministers had the ‘utmost sympathy’ for Mr Haines and his family.

Mrs Haines said: ‘My daughter keeps asking about him every day. She hasn’t seen her father for a year and a half. She has gone through so much. She sees me crying all the time.’

The 45-year-old businesswoman, who met her husband helping refugees during the Balkans war and married him in 2010, said: 'They told me that I can’t say anything. I don’t want to make his situation worse.’

Mr Haines, 44, appeared in a chilling video of the murder of US journalist Steven Sotloff. The killer, a Briton known as ‘Jihadi John’, warned he would be next.

He was popular in Croatia, where he had worked since 1999, and his former landlady was distraught yesterday as she clutched a picture of him. 

Nena Skoric, 67, who he affectionately called ‘mama’, said: ‘He is like a son of my own. I am praying for him. It didn’t matter to him whether people were Croats, Serbs or Muslims, as long as they needed help.’

Mr Haines, an aid worker for 16 years, was captured near Syria’s Turkish border in March 2013 with Italian Federico Motka.

He is said to have been beaten so badly that his kidnappers were forced to arrange medical treatment. Some hostages were subjected to waterboarding, electric shocks and mock executions. At one point they were held underground in a city under constant bombardment.

Mr Haines may have been singled out because of his nationality, although hostages freed after ransoms were paid have said that in recent months he has been treated more ‘humanely’.

Mr Haines gave one freed hostage a message for his family, saying he was being treated well.

Mr Motka, who was freed in May after a £4.75million ransom is said to have been paid, shared his cell and has spoken of being tortured. It appeared that Mr Haines was targeted by kidnappers who sold him on to IS for profit.

Former Foreign Secretary William Hague has expressed his fear that the world is playing into the hands of Islamic State extremists.

'I do think it is a pity sometimes that the things they put on the internet to serve their own propaganda and glorify what they are doing are so readily disseminated by the press', he told The Times.

'But I am not suggesting that we can control that in any way.'

He said it is 'heartbreaking' for a politician to have to deal with a hostage crisis.

'These are some of the most difficult decisions, life and death ones, I had to help make.'

But he insisted that paying ransoms is a 'terrible mistake...That then gives millions of dollars to terrorists to kidnap other people'.
