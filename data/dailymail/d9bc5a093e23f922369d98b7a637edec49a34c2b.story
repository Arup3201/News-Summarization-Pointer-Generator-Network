The campaign to force the Washington Redskins to change their name gained a significant victory on Wednesday when the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office canceled the team's federal trademarks because their nickname is ‘disparaging of Native Americans’.

The 2:1 decision by a Patent Office administrative tribunal follows years of criticism of the Washington club by Native Americans and others who say the name is derogatory.

The ruling doesn’t mean the Redskins have to change their name, but the team – and the NFL - now lose their ability to protect the trademark and the decision opens the door for others to legally use the logos and the name.

The campaign to force the Washington Redskins to change their name has gained a significant victory after the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office canceled the team's federal trademarks because the nickname is 'disparaging of Native Americans'

In ruling against the team, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board wrote, ‘We decide, based on the evidence properly before us, that these registrations must be cancelled because they were disparaging to Native Americans at the respective times they were registered.’

The case - filed on behalf of five Native Americans - was brought against the team by Navajo activist Amanda Blackhorse. ‘I am extremely happy that the [board] ruled in our favor,’ she said.

‘It is a great victory for Native Americans and for all Americans. We filed our petition eight years ago and it has been a tough battle ever since.

‘I hope this ruling brings us a step 
closer to that inevitable day when the name of the Washington football 
team will be changed.’

The team will however be allowed to retain trademark protection during an appeal, which can be reviewed by a federal court.

U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) has lauded Wednesday's result as a ‘landmark decision.’

'This is not the end of this case, but this is a landmark decision by the Patent Office that says that the NFL team here in Washington D.C. does not have patentable name, and that this is an offensive term not patentable by the patent office,’ said Senator Cantwell, speaking on the U.S. Senate floor on Wednesday.

'I hope that all the business decisions at the team will be made with the understanding that this is no longer a business case and we will get off of this slur of a name that we need to change.'

Redskins owner Daniel Snyder has steadfastly refused to change the team's name, citing tradition, but there has been growing pressure in recent months including statements from President Barack Obama, lawmakers of both parties and civil rights groups.

As of last month, 50 U.S. senators had written ‘scathing’ letters to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.  

In October, President Obama spoke out against the team’s name: ‘If I were the owner of the team and I knew that there was a name of my team - even if it had a storied history - that was offending a sizable group of people, I’d think about changing it.’

The decision opens the door for others to legally use the Washington Redskins' logos and the name

The decision by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board is similar to one it issued in 1999.

That ruling was overturned in 2003 in large part on a technicality after the courts decided that the plaintiffs were too old and should have filed their complaint soon after the Redskins registered their nickname in 1967.

The new case was launched in 2006 by a younger group of Native Americans, and was heard by the board in March of last year.

The group argued that the Redskins should lose their federal trademark protection based on a law that prohibits registered names that are disparaging, scandalous, contemptuous or disreputable.

One of driving force behind the case is a 69-year-old grandmother and longtime Native American activist named Suzan Harjo.

U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) has lauded the result against the Redskins as a 'landmark decision'

In high school, she was inspired to fight against what she describes as ‘racist stereotypes in American sports’ because of an Oklahoma Native American activist named Clyde Warrior.

‘He made a personal cause of getting rid of the mascot 'Little Red' at the University of Oklahoma,’ Harjo told Business Insider.

‘Most of the Indians in Oklahoma couldn't stand 'Little Red' and we called him the dancing idiot. He was always portrayed by a white guy in Indian costume.’

Little Red was eventually banished by University of Oklahoma President J. Herbert Hollomon in 1970.

According to Harjo, activists involved in the effort to eliminate Native American mascots always viewed the Washington Redskins football team as ‘the worst’ offender.
