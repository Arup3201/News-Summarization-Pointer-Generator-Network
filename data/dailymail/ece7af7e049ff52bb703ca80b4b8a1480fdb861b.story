A police officer has been fired after drunkenly waving his gun at a shop assistant, wearing only a bulletproof vest on his upper body.

Off-duty policeman Kyle James McCartin, 23, and a male companion turned up at the Giant gas station in Tucson, Arizona at 3am on Tuesday morning.

CCTV then caught McCartin brandishing his gun and pointing it right at the frightened shop assistant as he and his friend paid at the counter.

McCartin and his companion arrived at the shop in Tuscon in the early hours of Tuesday morning, allegedly drunk

McCartin is facing charges of aggravated assault after he was pictured recklessly waving his gun around a shop

McCartin was told to put the gun down by his friend but is seen on security footage pointing the gun back at the shop assistant, seemingly unprovoked. 

Sheriff's investigators said McCartin did not make any demands of the clerk, and the pair paid for their purchases.

The pair then fled on foot but were caught by McCartin's colleagues at a nearby apartment complex.

McCartin was arrested and charged at the Pima County Jail on two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. 

McCartin's friend persuaded him to stop pointing the weapon at the shop assistant as he paid for their purchases

However, moments later McCartin was once more pointing the gun at the shop assistant

Tucson Police issued a statement to clarify that McCartin has since been fired following a brief investigation.

He had only been with the department for 10 months and was on probationary status at the time.

Deputy Jesus Banuelos from Pima County 
Sheriff's office told KVOA TV: 'We would hope people in the community 
will not take this incident and hold it against other officers and 
deputies who are out there working hard'.

Tuscon Police Chief Roberto Villaseñor decided to fire McCartin after a swift investigation into the alleged assault and McCartin will appear in court in August

A judge ordered McCartin not to return to the scene of the crime.

He is now at the Pima County Adult Detention Center and is set to appear in court on August 5.

'I think young people still have maturing to do,' Deputy Chief Sharon Allen told KVOA.

'He's 23 and sometimes added years allow you to be a more mature person.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
