A billionaire French hotelier has 
been shot dead 'in a professional hit' in the Paris mansion he bought to
 showcase his Art Deco collection.

Claude Dray, 76, was found with three
 bullet holes in the neck in Neuilly-sur-Seine, the Paris suburb where 
President Nicolas Sarkozy built his career and still owns property.

He was found by his butler dressed only in a T-shirt and shorts, in his bedroom at 9am on Tuesday.

Bullet cartridges were found next to 
Mr Dray, with detectives saying they were fired from a pistol which was 
around 15 years old. No weapon was found.

There were no signs of a struggle and
 nothing was stolen from the palatial 'Villa Madrid’, which is considered to be one of the most secure houses the French capital.

Police said it had the hallmarks of a ‘professional hit.'

‘Somebody got in and fired three 
bullets into the victim's neck,’ said one detective at the scene, adding
 that a silencer had likely been used as domestic staff heard nothing.

His wife, Simone, was in the US, where four years ago her husband bought the famous National Hotel in South Beach, Miami.

Mr Dray, one of the most prominent 
Jews in France, also owned the Hotel de Paris in St Tropez, one of the 
most popular celebrity institutions on the French Riviera, as well as a 
string of other hotels around the world.

He had bought Villa Madrid in 1990 as he 
and his wife built up a vast Art Deco collection of furniture and other 
objects, which featured some 25 pieces by Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann alone.

Most of it was sold at auction in 
2007, fetching a record-breaking £55million. The couple said all the 
proceeds were for their four daughters and seven grandchildren.

Mr Dray had been the subject of threats 
in the past, and his home, which was equipped with anti-intruder 
measures including cameras and infra-red alarms, was regularly 
surrounded by police and private security guards.

The most recent extortion threats were in 2009, into which the Paris Prosecutor's Office opened an inquiry.

An
 autopsy on Mr Dray’s body was today being carried out at the 
Medical-Legal institute in Paris, with results expected to be made 
public within the next few days.

Mr Dray was born and brought up in Oran, Algeria, before founding the Cidotel hotel chain in the 1960s.

Mr Sarkozy was the mayor of Neuilly for many years, and built up close friendships with its super-rich residents, who, along with Mr Dray, include Liliane Bettencourt, the L'Oreal heiress who is France's wealthiest woman. Mr Sarkozy has lived in Neuilly for most of his life.

He still owns flats there, but now divides his time between his quarters at the Elysee Palace and a town house belonging to his third wife, the Italian heiress Carla Bruni.

The Art Deco design style began in Paris in the 1920s, and soon spread abroad to countries including Britain and America.
