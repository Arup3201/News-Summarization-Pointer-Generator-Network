An architect found dead in a walk-in freezer in the garage of his  home in Scotland may have committed suicide, it has been revealed.

Father-of-three Colin Machin, 50, was found dead in the deep-freeze in Alva, Clackmannanshire, in June.

Due to the  nature of the discovery, police treated his death as 'unexplained' and immediately launched an investigation.

This has now concluded and police said today that foul play had been ruled out. It is understood his death is now being treated as a suicide.

A certificate registered on Monday said the actual cause of death remained unknown 'pending laboratory studies'.

A Police Scotland spokesman said today: 'Enquiries have concluded and a report has been submitted to the procurator fiscal.

'There are no suspicious circumstances and we are not looking for anyone in connection with the death.'

The closure of the inquiry opens the way for Mr Machin's funeral, which will take place at St Mungo's Roman Catholic Church in Alloa next Wednesday.

The Machin family have asked for only family flowers but for donations to be made to Rachel House Children's Hospice.

Mr Machin left behind his wife, Maria, 51, and daughters Sinead, 23, and Erin, 21.

His youngest daughter Orla, suffered from rare genetic condition Edwards' Syndrome, and regularly attended the hospice in Kinross for respite until her death in 2008, aged 10.

A police investigation into the death has concluded and police said today that foul play had been ruled out. It is understood his death is now being treated as a suicide

At the time of her father's death, Erin paid tribute to him on social media with words from Dougie Maclean's Caledonia.

She wrote: 'Let me tell you that I love you.

'And I think about you all the time.'

The Dundee University graduate ran Machin Associates and he and his wife rented out several holiday cottages at their home at Boll Farm.

Last year he co-founded award-winning architectural practice Machin Dunn & MacFarlane Ltd, which was appointed to work on the redevelopment of a major site in Alloa.

Mr Machin was also director of an Edinburgh based firm, Tigh Grain Ltd, which is due to start work on 48 social-rented houses on the former Alva Academy site.

In addition to his work as an architect, Mr Machin was tourism representative on the board of Clackmannanshire Business and was known for his charitable work through the Rotary Club of Alloa which he joined in 1992 and served as president in 1999.
