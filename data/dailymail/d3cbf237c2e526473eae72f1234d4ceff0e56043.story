It's not just humans who get carried away in preparing a meal that is far too large for them to enjoy.

A greedy toad found deep in the Peruvian rainforest tried to swallow a hapless bat whole but only succeeded in making itself look like a bizarre mutant animal as it failed to eat its super-sized meal.

A quick-witted ranger captured the macabre but comic scene, which saw both animals suffer some discomfort but survive.

The cane toad is a large, terrestrial amphibian that is native to Central and South America, but has been introduced to various islands throughout Oceania and the Caribbean.

The cane toad is a prolific breeder - females lay single-clump spawns with thousands of eggs. 

Its reproductive success is partly because of opportunistic feeding as the toad has a diet of both dead and living matter.

Adults average 10 to 15 cm in length but the largest recorded specimen weighed 2.65 kg  and measured 38 cm long.

The cane toad is an old species and a fossil toad dating from the late Miocene of Colombia is indistinguishable from modern cane toads from northern South America.

The species has poison glands and the tadpoles are highly toxic to most animals if ingested.

The cane toad is now considered a pest and an invasive species in some of the regions it was introduced into as a method of pest control.

Park ranger Yufani Olaya spotted the strange behaviour in the Cerros de Amotape national park, the Rainforest Expeditions blog reported.

He said the cane toad was sitting on the ground with its mouth open as it optimistically waited for its lunch to appear and seemed to get lucky as a low-flying bat entered its area.

Experts believe bats fly close to the ground despite the rick of predators to pick up insects and Mr Olaya said the bat passed incredibly close to the toad, almost flying into its mouth.

The toad reportedly snatched at the bat, but it is not clear whether this was a refex action or a deliberate move to snare a large dinner.

Whatever the case, the creature clamped its powerful jaws around the furry critter, cramming it into its mouth.

The photograph captures the toad's discomfort as it battles to swallow the mammal whole, despite the bat's wings and tail sticking out of its mouth.

It is not clear if the cane toad (like the one pictured) deliberately lunged at the bat or expected its meal to be slightly smaller, but the creature reportedly clamped its powerful jaws around the furry critter, cramming it into its mouth

Adam Leaché, assistant professor of herpetology at the University of Washington, told NBC News: 'Toads are voracious and will eat pretty much anything that moves and can fit in their mouth.'

However, he said he had not seen another toad attempt the same move before.

While the creatures can swallow large beetles and centipedes with ease, the bat was either too large or too furry for the hungry amphibian as it spat out its dinner.

Charles Linkem, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Washington, explained that as cane toads do not have teeth, the animal tried to crush and swallow the bat.

A happy ending: Despite almost becoming dinner, the bat escaped unscathed and flew away quickly after its incarceration in the toad's mouth. A short-tailed fruit bat that lives in the Peruvian rainforest is pictured

He told NBC News: 'The bat was a little big for that. The 
toad may have tried to reposition its mouth to swallow and that was when
the bat was able to escape.'

Amazingly, despite the ordeal the bat escaped unscathed and flew away quickly after its incarceration.

The amphibians are known to eat almost anything, which perhaps accounts why they have invaded so many habitats.

Dr Linkem said: 'It could be this population of toads have
developed a strategy for feeding on low flying bats and that this is 
more common, but never observed before now.'

While scientists have not seen the toad behave in this way before, the amphibian is not a picky eater and has a diet of both dead and living matter
