A Washington attorney suing the Environmental Protection Agency for refusing to disclose information about the creation and use of the 
‘secondary’ email accounts, says the agency's chief is resigning in part because of the Justice Department's decision to publicize thousands of secret alias emails she was responsible for.

Chris Horner, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, said the scrutiny over the alias emails tied to coal regulation, which will be publicly released next month, is clearly a factor behind EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson’s decision to step down.

‘Life's full of coincidences, but this is too many,’ Horner told FoxNews.com. ‘She had no choice.’

He called Jackson's account a ‘deliberate, several stage deception.’ 

Stepping down: EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson, who set up a 'secondary' alias email account possibly to conduct business inside the agency, announced her plans to resign on Thursday

Horner and the CEI sued the EPA in the fall for ignoring requests for documents tied to Jackson's use of the alias email account.

The conservative lawyer, who is an outspoken skeptic of climate change, said on Thursday that the increased scrutiny on the account combined with what the thousands of secret emails might contain regarding the Obama administration's alleged ‘war on coal,’ led to Jackson's announcement earlier in the day.

‘She, by her action, told us that these are records she doesn't want the people to see,’ Horner said.

The EPA, represented by the Justice Department, agreed two weeks ago to release as many as 12,000 emails related to CEI requests beginning January 14, and continue at a rate of 3,000 documents per month, court documents state.

Jackson, 50, the agency's first black administrator, said in a written statement on Thursday that she is leaving the EPA after four years on the job, for ‘new challenges, time with my family and new opportunities to make a difference.’

The EPA did not offer further explanation.

Her departure also comes as environmental activists are increasingly 
questioning Obama’s commitment to dealing with climate change and 
other environmental problems, according to the New York Times.

President Obama, in a written statement, made no reference to the alias emails.

‘Over the last four years, Lisa Jackson has shown an unwavering commitment to the health of our families and our children,’ the President said.

‘Under her leadership, the EPA has taken sensible and important steps to protect the air we breathe and the water we drink.’

It was revealed in November that Jackson’s secret identity email account name is ‘Richard Windsor,’ which derived from her family dog Richard and her hometown East Windsor, New Jersey.

Jackson has said that she used the second account because her public email address was widely known.

Earlier in December, the EPA inspector general's office said that it was opening an audit into the agency's ‘electronic records management practices.’

The office said it would look into whether the EPA was encouraging the use of ‘private or alias email accounts to conduct official government business.’

Horner told WND in October that the Obama administration has routinely tried to hinder his requests for information by forwarding them to the wrong agencies and saying he would have to pay large fees for the documents to be processed.

Other times his requests were flat out ignored, he said.

Horner has filed multiple Freedom of Information Act requests to get documents from the past three administrations.

Jackson's tenure at the EPA was marked by a string of high-profile brawls over global warming pollution between her agency, the energy industry and Republicans in Congress.

Under her leadership, the EPA established the first standards for emissions of mercury, arsenic and other airborne toxins from power plants.

Jackson played a key role in pushing for a delay in the Canada-to-Texas Keystone XL pipeline.

During her four years as EPA chief, congressional Republicans repeatedly tried to block the agency's regulations on coal and other industries. 

Jackson's resignation is effective following the President's State of the Union address next month.

No successor was immediately named. It is expected that the EPA's deputy administrator, Robert Perciasepe, will take over temporarily.
