A 15-year-old British schoolboy is attempting to become the youngest person to ski to the South Pole.

Lewis Clarke is due to set off later this month on a gruelling 735-mile, 60-day trek in temperatures that can drop to minus 40C.

But Lewis has already demonstrated his mettle by being part of the youngest relay team to swim the English Channel – at the age of 12.

Tough journey: Lewis Clarke, pictured training in Greenland earlier this year, will walk 12.5 miles a day in blizzards and temperatures as low as minus 40C

His latest journey will take him from Union Glacier on the coast of western Antarctica to the Pole,  9,000ft above sea level.

Accompanied by polar guide Carl Alvey, he hopes to walk an average  of 12.5 miles a day, carrying tents and equipment weighing 150lb –  and possibly confronting appalling blizzards.

The youngster will be trying to beat the record set by Canadian Sarah McNair-Landry, who skied to the South Pole in 2005 aged 18.

Lewis, a pupil at Queen Elizabeth’s Hospital School in Bristol, is raising money for the Prince’s Trust and already has the backing of TV presenter Dan Snow and a number of business sponsors.

Lewis said: ‘Some people claim to have walked or skied to the South Pole, but have done only the last 100 miles or so. Mine will be the real deal – the full, mind-blowingly freezing, 735-mile trip from the coast of Antarctica all the way to the Pole.’

To add to the challenge, Lewis is new to cross-country skiing and had his first lessons on Norway’s Hardanger Plateau in February. He said: ‘It’s the place where Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, who beat Captain Scott to the Pole in 1911, trained. It was the only place where Amundsen struggled and nearly died.’

In March, Lewis spent two weeks  in Greenland. He said: ‘There was just one problem – we had the most unbelievable weather. No blizzard-force winds, no freezing temperatures, just sun and clear skies. The sun made the scenery look glorious but for experience it would have been good to see what really bad weather can be like.’

Brutal climate: His parents are aware of the dangers posed by conditions in the Antarctic, which defeated Captain Scott, who died there in 1912

Lewis and his parents are aware of the dangers posed by Antarctica’s brutal climate, which has defeated the most seasoned explorers, including Scott who died there in 1912.

He added: ‘It’s the greatest adventure of my life so far, and the greatest physical challenge, but there  are real risks.’

His mother Sarah Johnson, a trainee GP, said: ‘When Lewis said he wanted to swim the Channel, like any mother I was worried. Now he’s upping the ante, so there are greater worries this time.

‘But he’s trained hard and if anyone can do it, Lewis can. At least he’s doing something amazing rather than hanging around on street corners or playing computer games all day. We’re so proud of him.’

His father Stephen Clarke, a TV executive, added: ‘There’s no knowing with Lewis, he’s so intrepid. But whatever he comes up with, we’ll support him.’
