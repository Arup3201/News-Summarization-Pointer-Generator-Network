A 15-year-old girl who was fatally struck by a freight train in a suspected suicide posted a farewell message online hours before the incident.

'I love all of y'all. Never forget it!' Megan Whisenhunt, from Fort Worth, Texas wrote on Instagram on Wednesday, along with an image of herself smiling at the camera.

Megan was struck by the train near her home at around 9pm on Wednesday night but the remoteness of the location two miles from her home made it tough for medical staff to reach her.

She was pronounced dead just after 11pm and 'evidence indicates that [she] was attempting suicide', Police Captain Scott Conn said.

Final message: Fifteen-year-old Megan Whisenhunt  posted this image to her Instagram account before she apparently committed suicide on Wednesday, writing: 'I love all of y'all. Never forget it!'

Authorities have not given any 
suggestion as to what could have driven her to kill herself and social 
networking sites suggest she was an outgoing and well-liked student.

Afterwards, Megan headed to the tracks where she was hit by the Fort Worth & Western Railroad train, Captain Conn told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.

Two ambulances arrived at the scene but they had difficulty finding Megan in the dark, Brett Lyle, a MedStar spokeswoman said.

When they did find her, she had trauma injuries to her head and torso, according to fire department radio communications, and staff called for an air ambulance and lit the area with flares.

Loss: Friends and classmates took to social media to express their sadness over Megan's death

Family: Megan is pictured with her parents, Russ and Kristi, last year. It is unclear if she had any siblings

But on the way to hospital, the helicopter had to make a 'precautionary landing' at Meacham Airport when
 a 'status warning light' flashed on the flight deck, officials said.

'The landing was precautionary based on 
an status warning light on the flight deck,' said James Swartz, 
CareFlite president and CEO. 'It was not an emergency landing, which 
means we land immediately rather than continuing to a helipad or 
airport.'

From there, an ambulance then raced the girl to John Peter Smith Hospital, but she was pronounced dead at 11.05pm.

The Tarrant County medical examiner's office identified Megan early on Thursday and ruled that she suffered blunt force trauma to her head and left leg due to train and pedestrian collision.

Scene: She was hit two miles from her family's home and airlifted to hospital - but the helicopter needed to make an early landing because of a fault. She was pronounced dead in hospital on Wednesday night

Megan lived two miles from where she was struck.

She was active on social media and gave the impression of a well-liked student with a good sense of humor, although she often spoke negatively of her appearance.

Her grandmother, Peggy Ann, wrote on Facebook: 'My precious Megan. My granddaughter who gave up on life and chose not to suffer anymore. I miss you so much and wish I had known how to reach you and keep you safe.'

Friends are holding a candlelit vigil for Megan on Friday evening and students were instructed to wear purple or turquoise for Suicide Awareness.
