Crime boss: David Hunt (pictured leaving the High Court) has lost his libel claim against the Sunday Times after it described him as an 'underworld king'

The Sunday Times has won a libel action brought by a man it described as an 'underworld king'.

David Hunt claimed the May 2010 article meant he was the head of a crime organisation who had been shown to be concerned with murder, drug trafficking and fraud.

Hunt's lawyers told London's High Court it was a libel of 'exceptional gravity' and Hunt himself gave evidence that the allegations were 'heartbreaking', had 'crucified' him and impacted badly on his business relationships.

The judge found that the newspaper was correct in saying that Hunt had been violent and intimidating and that he was the head of an organisation involved in 'extreme violence and fraud'.

But he did not hold that the Sunday Times had proved his crime ring was involved in murder and drug trafficking.

Times Newspapers Ltd defended its story -
 headlined 'Underworld kings cash in on taxpayer land fund' - on the 
basis that it was substantially true and responsible reporting on a 
matter of public interest.

Hunt's
 barrister, Hugh Tomlinson QC, who is chairman of the Hacked off 
campaign, attempted to discredit the reporter who wrote the story.

However,
 after a 12-day hearing earlier this year, Mr Justice Simon dismissed 
the case, saying that journalist Michael Gillard was highly experienced 
and gave evidence that was both lucid and entirely credible.

Mr
 Gillard had been investigating Hunt and his associates for about 11 
years and during that time had obtained a significant amount of 
information which led him honestly to believe that Hunt was a violent 
and dangerous criminal at the head of a family-based network.

The
 judge said it was not a case in which a defendant 'embroidered the 
allegations with epithets and gratuitous adjectives', nor was there any 
evidence of embellishment of the facts.

Thrown out: Mr Justice Simon (pictured) dismissed attempts by Hunt's lawyers to discredit the reporter who wrote the story

He said: 'On the basis of the information Mr Gillard received from sources that he was entitled to treat as reliable and knowledgeable, as well as the information contained in documents, some of which I have referred to, I am satisfied that it was reasonable for him to describe the claimant as a violent and dangerous criminal and the head of an organised crime group implicated in murder, drug trafficking and fraud.

'I am also satisfied that he honestly believed that the allegations were accurate and true, and that it was his duty to write the article in the form that it was published.'

He added that Mr Gillard behaved fairly and responsibly in gathering the information and in ensuring what was published was accurate and fair. It was 'a serious piece of investigative journalism'.

The judge said the newspaper had justified its case that there were grounds to suspect Hunt was responsible for the intimidation of the main witnesses against him when he was prosecuted in 1999 for a violent assault, and that he attacked and threatened to kill a man at a court hearing and then avoided prosecution through intimidation.

He added he had little difficulty in accepting it had justified that part of the meaning which related to Hunt being the head of an organised crime network, implicated in extreme violence and fraud.

He did not, however, accept that involvement in murder and drug-trafficking were necessarily included within a general description of a head of an organised crime network.

The judge said the newspaper had produced evidence from a number of police officers that Hunt was known as a major criminal, which was criticised by Hunt's lawyers on the basis that the officers were simply reciting what they had read in confidential police documents which were based on unsubstantiated reports and rumours.

Hugh Tomlinson QC is renowend for keeping fighting privacy cases for this clients

David Hunt was represented in his libel case against the Sunday Times by renowned and controversial lawyer Hugh Tomlinson QC.

Mr Tomlinson became known for keeping his clients - often celebrities and high-profile figures - anonymous by forging a career as a leading securer of privacy injunctions.

'Rules have been laid down,' the 59-year-old once told the Guardian.

'The fact the law is difficult to enforce doesn't mean you don't try to enforce it.

'The current legal position has got the balance essentially right.

'The main point of contention is that
 the press say that if someone is having an adulterous affair, that's 
something that should be exposed.

'The judges don't agree.'

More recently, he has made a name for himself as the lawyer for the Hacked Off pressure group, which is demanding state-backed regulation of the press.

In May, a senior Liberal Democrat MP used a Commons motion to launch an astonishing attack on Mr Tomlinson for 'acting against freedom of expression and the rule of law' during his legal career.

John Hemming criticised him for his role in bringing legal injunctions on behalf of celebrities.

In his early day motion, Mr Hemming criticised Mr Tomlinson – a barrister based at Cherie Blair's Matrix Chambers – for taking out the super-injunction which banned any mention of an affair between Giggs and model Imogen Thomas.

Mr Hemming also claimed that Mr Tomlinson helped to secure the 'secret imprisonment' of a woman simply for 'writing emails'.

He accused him of playing a key role in Yvonne Goder being jailed after she sent emails to the Law Society complaining that a solicitors' firm had defrauded her mother using the Court of Protection.

Mr Tomlinson's spokesman previously said the the motion contained 'a number of significant factual errors.'

He added: 'Mr Tomlinson must take cases within his areas of expertise: he is not permitted to choose which cases to take based on his personal view.

'The arguments he advances are based on the instructions of his clients.

'Mr Hemming is entitled to criticise Mr Tomlinson's personal views, or the views of Hacked Off, but he is not entitled to attribute to Mr Tomlinson the views and arguments of his clients.'
