Comic Relief has broken the £1billion barrier after raising more than £78million on this year's Red Nose Day alone.

A host of celebrities including Rowan Atkinson and David Walliams performed one-off sketches while others completed crazy challenges for the annual event.

The total before last night’s telethon stood at £960m but record-breaking donations smashed the charity's target of raising £1bn by its thirtieth year.

Comic Relief has broken the £1billion barrier after raising more than £78million on this year's Red Nose Day alone. Fans were delighted when Rowan Atkinson (above) reprised his much-loved role as Mr Bean in his first Red Nose Day appearance in eight years

Fans were delighted when Atkinson reprised his much-loved role as Mr Bean in his first Red Nose Day appearance in eight years.

His sketch saw him attend the wrong funeral before causing a scene by knocking the coffin of its stand.

He even paused to take a selfie of himself with the coffin during the skit.

Host Lenny Henry thanked Atkinson for his 'amazing' work - although some people on social media were left claiming it was 'distasteful'.

Viewers also saw David Walliams re-establish Little Britain character Lou.

But while the carer is normally seen looking after Andy the role of his fraudulent sidekick was instead played by Stephen Hawking.

The theoretical physicist turned his wheelchair into a Transformer to attack Walliams and Catherine Tate - who played a nun - in the comedy skit.

Hawking even made a famous Little Britain line his own as he said 'computer says die' before zapping Lou off the planet.

In a separate challenge Walliams snogged Hollywood hunk Orlando Bloom as the pair prepared to beat the world record for the most amount of kisses received in 30 seconds.

Bloom went straight for the comedian, who has recently separated from model wife Lara Stone. 

Emma Watson used her appearance with Dawn French in a Vicar Of Dibley sketch to mix her gender equality work with a little comedy.

The UN Ambassador was one of a host of women - including Maureen Lipman and Ruth Jones - who were vying for the job of archbishop after being informed that women now qualified for the role.

The show kicked off with Radio 2 DJ Dermot O'Leary completing a 24-hour danceathon to raise £643,336. 

The 41-year-old completed his epic challenge by showing off his moves outside the BBC Broadcasting House in London.

The X Factor presenter fought tiredness and pain to boogie his way to the finish line at the London Palladium, where the live coverage was being hosted, with help from celebrities including Caroline Flack and Jamie Oliver.

During the danceathon, which saw him cover the equivalent of 53 miles, O'Leary was only allowed breaks to go to the toilet.

After completing the event O'Leary took to Twitter to thank everyone who had donated.

He wrote: 'Good God. I had no idea how much I would raise. But it wasn't that. 641k! Thank you doesn't even begin to touch it. 24hrs I'll never forget.'

He later added: 'Thank you for your unending messages of good will and for your donations. Thanks so much to my team. A varied and motley bunch.

'Wouldn't have come anywhere near that amount without them. And now... To nod.' 

Other highlights included a James Bond mockumentary that suggested Daniel Craig really sounds like a little girl, with his 007 growl the work of comic Alan Carr.

Comedians Johnny Vegas, Patrick Kielty, Vic Reeves, Jack Dee and Mick Helm also took to the stage as  a spoof version of One Direction called No Direction.

Paul and Barry Elliott (left) - better known as The Chuckle Brothers - and Robbie Williams (right) also appeared in a sketch about being crowned National Treasure 2015

In another sketch celebrities including Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and Robbie Williams fought for a fictitious 'National Treasure' title.

A judging panel including Stephen Fry, Miranda Hart and Sheridan Smith saw model David Gandy strip down to his underwear and Russell Brand offer them a free copy of his book to try and get the crown.

The show ended with the announcement that Comic Relief and Sport Relief combined had raised a total of £1,047,083,706.

Host Claudia Winkleman said of the £78m raised last night: 'That's the highest total we have ever raised at the end of a Red Nose Day. Thank you so much.'

Walliams said: 'We work hard to bring you the best comedy we possibly can on Comic Relief but for me the most memorable moments are always the appeal films.' 

Film-maker Richard Curtis, founder and vice-chairman of Comic Relief, described the moment he knew they had broken their target as 'very strange'.  

July 1985: Film-maker Richard Curtis and friends come up with the idea of using comedy to raise money and change lives in Africa and the UK.

Christmas Day 1985: Comic Relief is launched by Curtis and comedian Lenny Henry for the first time on BBC One from the Safawa refugee camp in Sudan. 

February 1988: The first Red Nose Day is held to raise money for Comic Relief. Over 150 celebrities and comedians take part, raising more than £15million. 

July 2002: Comic Relief's sister charity event Sport Relief kicks off and more than £14m is raised.

2003: The first red nose to feature hair is launched and the day raised £61.6m.

June 2006: David Walliams swims the Channel  raising £1m for Comic Relief in the process.

2009: Nine celebrities including Gary Barlow and Fearne Cotton climb up Mt Kilimanjaro and raise more than £3m for the charity. 

Comedian Eddie Izzard also runs 43 marathons in 51 days and raises in excess of £1.8m. 

The show in 2009 raised a record-breaking £65m and Sainsbury's, which sells the official Comic Relief merchandise, hands over more than £9m - the biggest single donation in the event's history. 

March 2015: The total before this year’s telethon stood at £960m but record-breaking donations smashed the charity's target of raising £1bn by its thirtieth year

Throughout the night clips were used to show how donations would be used. One piece of footage, presented by John Bishop (third from right) and Richard Hammond (right) shows Iyolwa Health Centre in eastern Uganda

Other clips showed infrastructure being built by materials bought using donations from the annual event

The money raised makes a huge difference to communities and individuals across the world

He said: 'When a bunch of comedians got together all those years ago we dreamed of raising a million or two, and never imagined the generosity that would be shown by the British public for so many years.

'Figures tell us that the £1bn has helped around 50 million people in the UK and overseas, 50 million people whose lives have been changed or saved by the generosity of people they have never met. 

'It is an extraordinary thing that we do in Britain and I am enormously proud to be part of it.

'Our thanks to every single person who has ever done their bit over the last 30 years - both the funny and the money.'
