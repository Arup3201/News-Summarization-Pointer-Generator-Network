A police officer whose ballistics evidence forms a key element of the murder case against Shrien Dewani has been exposed as having presented misleading evidence to court.

South African forensics officer Sgt. Pieter Engelbrecht was said to have provided Shrien Dewani's murder trial with two contradictory explanations of how his wife was shot.

The first explanation - provided in a statement of fact to court called an affidavit - claimed Anni was shot with a bullet from a 38mm calibre, American-made revolver type gun, Dewani's trial heard.

The second explanation - provided in another affidavit commissioned by Sgt. Engelbrecht and submitted to the same court - claimed Anni was shot from a 25mm calibre, Chinese-made semi-automatic pistol.

While Shrien Dewani's defence team conceded that Anni was shot with the Chinese pistol, they argued that Sgt. Engelbrecht's apparent willingness to provide contradictory stories indicates bias against their client.

As defence barrister Pieter Botha explained, 'affidavits' are not only meant to be legally binding statements of unambiguous fact, they should also be unique.

Anni Dewani was shot dead on her November 2010 honeymoon to South Africa when the taxi cab she and her husband were travelling in was hijacked

But aside from the type of gun, both Engelbrecht's affidavits, the barrister claimed in court, are identical, even down to the positioning of the two documents' signatures.

What's more, the digital 'metadata' contained in an electronic version of one of the documents indicates it was created some 19 months after Sgt. Engelbrecht claimed it to have been.

'Is it possible', the lawyer Botha asked the policeman, 'that one is a photocopy of the other? 

Could I put it to you that one crucial aspect was changed in one document and a copy of it was made? That is what happened here.'

Sgt. Engelbrecht said he could not comment on this allegation.

The twin affidavits were not the only pieces of questionable evidence Sgt. Engelbrecht struggled to explain on the witness stand.

The officer - who said he examined the car in which Anni's body was found - was asked about his evidence to the 2012 murder trial of Xolile Mngeni, the now dead hijacker found guilty of shooting Anni Dewani.

Engelbrecht agreed that while he had earlier told a court that Mngeni was likely to be Anni's killer, he did not have any conclusive data to support this conclusion.

'How could you give your opinion when you were unaware of the necessary facts to say so?' Dewani's lawyer asked.

'Maybe I did not understand', Engelbrecht replied.

'You would agree that your answer could have misled the court?' the lawyer went on.

'Yes.' Engelbrecht replied.

Anni Dewani was shot dead on her November 2010 honeymoon to South Africa when the taxi cab she and her husband were travelling in was hijacked as it passed through Cape Town's dangerous Gugulethu township.

Sgt. Pieter Engelbrecht was asked about his evidence to the 2012 murder trial of Xolile Mngeni (pictured), the now dead hijacker found guilty of shooting Anni Dewani.

So far three local men - including the taxi's driver - have confessed to taking part in the murder plot, but they all claim they did so at Shrien Dewani's behest.

Mziwamadoda Qwabe, the only one of these three men present at the moment of Anni's killing claims she was shot by his accomplice Xolile Mngeni from the cab's front left passenger seat.

Giving evidence yesterday, Sgt. Engelbrecht initially confirmed that, in his opinion, Qwabe's story holds true and that Anni was likely to have been shot in the front passenger seat.

Under cross examination, however, the officer conceded that he based this opinion partly on measurements taken from a different car to the one used in the hijack and one in which the seats were positioned differently to the way they were during the hijack.

Shrien Dewani denies any involvement in the murder of his wife. The case will not sit tomorrow in order that both Anni and Shrien Dewanis' families can celebrate the Hindu festival of Diwali

'What on earth did you, an expert, hope to achieve when you took measurements of a vehicle where the distances are nothing to do with the car in this case?', Dewani's apparently incredulous barrister asked the policeman, to an ambiguous response.

Later, when Sgt. Engelbrecht refused to acknowledge that one of his own photographs - taken on Tuesday this week and submitted as evidence later the same day - proved him to have taken inaccurate measurements, the lawyer Botha went further.

'You are miles away from being an objective witness', Botha chided the policeman. 'You do not want to concede that which an objective person - even a child - can see to be true.'

'It is patently clear that your previous evidence is false', to which Sgt. Engelbrecht replied: 'It is not a matter that I wanted to mess up the case'.

Shrien Dewani denies any involvement in the murder of his wife. The case will not sit tomorrow in order that both Anni and Shrien Dewanis' families can celebrate the Hindu festival of Diwali. It is set to resume next Monday.
