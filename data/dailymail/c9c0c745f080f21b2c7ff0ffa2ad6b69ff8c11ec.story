When a passenger arrives into London and promptly enquirers whether most people in England speak English, there requires a certain level of diplomacy (and a straight face) from whoever is answering the question.

But this is the kind of head-scratching enquiry that employees at Heathrow   regularly face.

As the airport unveils its next generation of passenger service, Heathrow Helpers, it has revealed the top ten most bizarre queries and requests from visitors.

'Where can I exchange currency for some Scottish dollars?' Heathrow airport has revealed the top ten strangest questions from passengers

The list includes requests ranging from wanting to try on the Crown Jewels to bungee jumping off of the Heathrow control tower. 

Some of the genuine questions from befuddled passengers must have Helpers biting their tongue, from 'where can I exchange currency for Scottish dollars?' to 'What's the difference between a toilet and a loo?'

Other passengers have asked for Heathrow employees to mark every single ATM in central London on their map for them. Given this number is in the thousands, they might be there for a while. 

1. Can I bungee jump from your control tower?

2. I am heading to Tower Hill; can I try the Crown Jewels on there?

3. What's the difference between a toilet and a loo?

4. Are there ATMs in central London? Can you mark them on my map?

5. Where can I exchange currency for some Scottish dollars?

6. Will most people speak English during my holiday in London?

7. Where can I see James Bond's house?

8. Will I be able to see Beefeaters in the street?

9. Can I drink the water here?

10. Do I need to change the time on my watch or will it change automatically when I fly?

I want to visit 007: Among the bizarre requests faced by Heathrow employees every day is where a passenger can find the fictional character James Bond's house

The team of expertly trained helpers will be on hand to assist with every passenger demand, from handing out tissues to relatives waving off loved ones in the departure lounge, through to sharing the latest restaurant openings in key destinations.

Based throughout the airport, passengers will be able to identify the caring crew by their purple uniforms and invaluable tool belts. 

Each tool belt will contain the necessary equipment to respond to the most popular passenger requests, including cuddly toys to keep young children happy and technology chargers for business travellers.

On hand to help: The airport has announced its new team of Heathrow Helpers, who are available to assist visitors, from handing out tissues to relatives of departing passengers to advising on restaurants

Ready for anything: The Helpers wear 'tool belts' supplied with cuddly toys for children, phrase books, umbrellas and technology chargers

With a combined experience of 264 years assisting passengers, each Heathrow Helper has been selected to be part of the team based on their exceptional skill sets, from being tourism specialists to proficiency in sign language. The dedicated team also speak more than 38 languages between them.

One of Heathrow's passengers found a Helper so wonderful, they even ended up marrying them. 

For those passengers after the next level of personal service, Heathrow is set to launch a bespoke treatment - Heathrow Upgrade. 

Impressive service: The airport has also announced the launch of the 'Heathrow Upgrade' service, which offers passengers VIP treatment for the duration of their journey

This service will provide passengers with their very own Heathrow Helper for the duration of their journey, a Heathrow Porter to carry bags and even their very own buggy to transport them around the terminal.

The service starts from £9 for a porter to carry your bags. The 'Meet & Assist' service sees a Helper guide you all the way through the terminal and starts from £100 for two people.

Demanding passengers: From whether Beefeaters are everywhere on the streets (left), to requests to try on the Crown Jewels (right), the Helpers are ready to tackle the most bizarre queries

Normand Boivin, the Chief Operating Officer at Heathrow said: 'At Heathrow, we see a wide range of passengers travelling through the airport daily, and with this comes a variety of needs and demands that must be catered for. 

'That's why our latest trial highlights Heathrow's endeavour to provide a unique and bespoke service to everyone using the airport. 

'Our Heathrow Helpers will be present all week, providing passengers with that extra special treatment.'
