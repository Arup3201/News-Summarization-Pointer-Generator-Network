Borussia Dortmund are laying the groundwork for the potential departure of Mats Hummels to Manchester United.

Hummels has underlined in recent days that he intends to see out his contract but it is understood meetings have taken place outlining a price to United of around £37million.

Dortmund have also earmarked a potential replacement in Dinamo Kiev's Aleksandar Dragovic and have made contact this week.

Hummels has shown signs of frustration at being constantly asked the question of whether he will depart for Old Trafford, snapping at reporters, and it has not helped Dortmund's cause. They are staring relegation in the face as they prepare for the second half of the Bundesliga season and Jurgen Klopp has called for the group to close together with Marco Reus also the subject of interest from Real Madrid, Manchester City and Chelsea as his release clause kicks in.

United have not denied interest in Hummels but have asked about other players in his position too.

Kiev's Dragovic, 23, is one of those who has been watched by United also but has had mixed scouting reports. West Ham were also keen but his value is out of their budget at £15m. Leicester City did make a bold attempt to take him on loan this week, offering a fee and to cover his wages, but the player declined.

Sadik El Fitouri impressed Manchester United coaches in a trial game and could join the club

Manchester United are ready to offer a contract to Salford City trialist Sadik El Fitouri.

Sportsmail revealed how the 20-year-old right back, who only joined Salford in December, had impressed staff during a game between United's Under 21s and first-team fringe players.

He has continued to impress in training and in games and United are willing to offer an 18-month deal.

El Fitouri was a junior at Manchester City but apparently fell out of love with the game and his limited prospects of breaking through. He joined Salford but was encouraged to try for United and that now looks to have paid off. He won't necessarily jump straight into the first-team squad but will help boost numbers and quality in Warren Joyce's Under 21 set-up.

Paris Saint-Germain remain the most prominent club chasing the signature of United teenager Andreas Pereira who is out of contract in the summer.

Chelsea winger Mohamed Salah is still being discussed as a potential makeweight in the Juan Cuadrado deal

Chelsea winger Mohamed Salah is still being discussed as a potential makeweight in the deal that brings Juan Cuadrado to Chelsea from Fiorentina.

Talks were ongoing last night and this morning with Real Sociedad and Roma also in the frame. Jose Mourinho is keen to help Moyes in particular but the Egyptian is keen on Italy.

As revealed by Sportsmail, Chelsea will sell Andre Schurrle, are in talks over Cuadrado and have tabled a parallel bid for Douglas Costa at Shakhtar Donetsk.

Swansea City are trying to sign Southampton midfielder Jack Cork.

The 25-year-old was given an ultimatum by Southampton manager Ronald Koeman to sign a new contract this week as his deal ends in the summer and the club want to protect themselves against losing him for nothing.

Koeman has enquired about Feyenoord's Tonny Vilhena and is down the line in talks with Benfica over the loan of Filip Djuricic.

Looming large is the expected bids from Arsenal, Tottenham and Liverpool for Morgan Schneiderlin. His departure could give Cork more opportunities but the likelihood is Southampton will buy another replacement with Jordy Clasie in Koeman's sights.

Swansea will offer around £3m for Cork and see how the next few days shape up.

Aston Villa have joined Newcastle by showing interest in MK Dons midfielder Dele Alli.

Newcastle are willing to pay £4m rising to £5m and allow the 18-year-old to return to Dons on loan for the rest of the season. Villa have discussed a similar deal with slightly more up front for the England Under 19 international who has scored 12 goals this season.

Manager Karl Robinson re-iterated: 'We know there has been communications with clubs. We hope we can do right by Dele and the club as well. I can't see him not wearing our shirt for the rest of the season. Part of the deal would be him staying with us for the rest of the season and joining whoever it is in the summer.

'There's no deal completely confirmed yet.'

Alli, who has also been watched by Liverpool and Bayern Munich, made his MK debut as a 16-year-old in November 2012, and has gone on to play 75 games, scoring 20 goals, and signed a contract until 2017 in September.

Villa are giving a trial to Michael Jordan Nkololo. The 22-year-old striker is hoping to impress Paul Lambert after playing at French side Chateauroux this season. They have also declared an interest in Besiktas striker Demba Ba who will be considerably more expensive.

West Ham hope to have an answer from Darren Fletcher with a two-and-a-half year deal on the table and the option of an extra year.

The Manchester United midfielder, who is now cured from ulcerative colitis following surgery, has had further talks with West Brom and Valencia but the latter has slipped away with Spain's deadline tomorrow night and Valencia unable to move out three players.

Fletcher has been allowed to leave on a free transfer and United will pay a contribution towards his wages with the 30-year-old at pains to point out he has had no dispute with Ed Woodward or Louis Van Gaal who he says have both been supportive in his move away.

Hamilton left-back Stephen Hendrie underwent his medical today at West Ham's training ground ahead of agreeing a pre-contract for the summer.

Ravel Morrison has agreed his move to Italian side Lazio and will wear the number four shirt.

Wigan are taking a look at Icelandic goalkeeper Hannes Halldorsen. Manager Malky Mackay wants cover with clubs continuing to show interest in Oman international Ali Al Habsi. The 30-year-old Halldorsson has 26 caps for Iceland and is an interesting character. He even directed the video for Iceland's entry to the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest and he is hoping to return to a career making films when he finishes with football.

Wigan are also taking a look at Olympiacos left-back Gaetan Bong. The 26-year-old Cameroon international is training with the club ahead of a potential deal.

Birmingham and Charlton are showing interest in Wigan's Rob Kiernan. The 24-year-old can play at centre-back or defensive midfield and has two years left on contract.

Burnley are showing an interest in Celtic's Anthony Stokes as they weigh up late additions. The 26-year-old former Arsenal and Sunderland striker is open to a move and keen to return to England. The Republic of Ireland international has had interest from Cardiff and Leeds United. Burnley remain in the frame for West Brom midfielder Graham Dorrans also. Birmingham, Middlesbrough and Fulham have enquired about loans but Albion want around £3m for the 27-year-old Scotland international.

Iain Hume has rejoined Tranmere Rovers on a six-month contract subject to international clearance.

The energetic striker, 31, has chosen to return to the League One club following his successful spell in the Indian Super League where he was voted Player of the League after helping Kerala Blasters reach the final.
