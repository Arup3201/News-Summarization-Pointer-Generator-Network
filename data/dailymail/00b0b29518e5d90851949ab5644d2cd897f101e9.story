Newcastle fans ramped up their protest against manager Alan Pardew ahead of their Premier League 2-2 draw against Hull at St James’ Park on Saturday.

Ahead of kick off angry Newcastle fans have been handing out thousands of posters with ‘sack Pardew’ printed on.

The disgruntled supporters have also covered a van outside the ground in the ‘Sack Pardew’ poster as the much maligned manager prepared for a hostile environment against Hull.

However despite a section of the crowd holding up the 'Sack Pardew' posters in the stands, the majority of fans got behind the team during the dramatic 2-2 draw with Hull.

In fact, the biggest noise to emanate from the home end was for the 17th and 18th minutes of applause for the two Newcastle fans who died in the MH17 disaster and for Jonas Gutierrez, who wears No 18 for the Magpies, as the Argentine continues his battle with testicular cancer.

Pardew said on Thursday he expected one of the ‘toughest days’ in the job against Hull having witnessed calls for him to be sacked intensify after the humiliating 4-0 loss at Southampton last weekend.

‘This will be one of our toughest, although I can think of some tough days I’ve had here.

‘The environment for the players on Saturday will probably be as tough as it’s ever been and we have to accept that, knowing that Hull will come and try to make good use of our situation.’

‘It’s going to be a difficult environment if we have the atmosphere we had at Southampton for long periods.’

Pardew held talks with owner Mike Ashley in the wake of last Saturday’s embarrassing 4-0 loss, a result which left the Magpies bottom of the Premier League.

‘We (myself and Ashley) had a long conversation on Sunday and he was obviously disappointed with the performance. He has a right to be disappointed as the owner and he relayed that to me'
