After waiting nearly 100 years for a suitable suitor, a rare plant has finally produced a family.

The female wild asparagus was discovered in Portland, Dorset, in 1997.

But it was the only survivor of the species in the area and, with no male nearby, it could not propagate – unlike most plants, asparagus has separate sexes, so to reproduce a male must pollinate a female.

Experts hunted for a mate, but the endangered wild asparagus is found at only 28 locations across the country.

The loneliest plant in Britain: The rare female wild asparagus has been saved after a specimen in the wilds of Dorset was mated with a male partner from 175 miles away in Cornwall

Success: Experts from five different agencies worked together to search for the plants, which are now thriving

It wasn’t until 2006 that experts found a male variety in Cornwall which they carefully moved to Dorset and then rubbed its pollen on the female’s stigmas.

Her fertilised flowers then grew, producing bright red berries which each containedsix seeds.

These were recovered, sowed in pots and grown in greenhouses.

After two years, 60 plants were deemed to be strong enough to plant out in the wild where they have spent the last five years.

Botanists from five different agencies - the National Trust, Natural England, the 
National Museum of Wales, the Dorset Wildlife Trust and the Dorset Environmental Records Centre - have made fruitless return trips to the site to see if the young plants had flowered.

But it wasn’t until their most recent visit yesterday that they could finally declare the project a success.

Out of the original 60 plants, 51 are thriving and 11 of them - seven males and four females - have now flowered for the first time, meaning they can reproduce.

Wild asparagus is found in only 28 sites in the UK, mainly in coastal areas in Cornwall and south Wales, and its habitat is being steadily reduced.

It was thought they were extinct in Dorset until the female was found but experts said it was only a matter of time before she died out.

The plant is different from the garden asparagus that is popular to eat because it grows flat along the ground and has smaller spears that have a bitter taste

The 60 plants were planted in two groups of 30; one on the causeway linking Weymouth and Portland alongside the lone female and the other near to Portland Bill lighthouse.

Janet Lister, a conservation advisor for the National Trust, said: 'It has taken them quite a while to mature but at long-last they are starting to flower which means they can sustain themselves.

'Although there are only 11 of them flowering at the moment, the key thing is that both male and females are flowering on both sites.

'We are confident it will only be a matter of time before the other young plants come into flower.

'The aim is to secure the population of wild asparagus in Dorset and we are very hopeful that that is going to happen.'

Bryan Edwards, an ecological surveyor at the Dorset Environmental Records Centre, said: 'We brought up a Cornish boy to have a bit of fun with our Dorset girl in 2006 and since then it has been a waiting game.

'Because their natural habitat is in an exposed, hostile environment like sea cliffs it has taken the seedlings a bit longer to grow and start to flower.

'To stand any chance of long term survival, a wild asparagus colony needs to contain plants of both sexes.

'Any colony reduced to a single plant is ultimately doomed to extinction.

'The males have a different size and shape of flower.'

As well as conserving a rare and endangered plant, it is hoped the genes from the wild asparagus could be introduced to the garden variety to make them more drought tolerant.

Wild asparagus appear to benefit from the North Atlantic Drift, the sea current that keeps the south west relatively warm, which is why they are found in coastal areas.
