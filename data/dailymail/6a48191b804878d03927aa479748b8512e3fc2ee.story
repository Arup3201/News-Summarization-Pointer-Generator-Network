Newcastle United will attack from the word go this season after Alan Pardew hailed the raft of offensive reinforcements bought by the club this summer.

Nine new players have arrived at St James’ Park, including Emmanuel Riviere, Siem De Jong and Jack Colback - offering Toon fans reason to expect a more attacking style.

Pardew was speaking at a club open day where many fans were savouring their first glimpses of the array of new talent.

He told Sky Sports News: ‘We’ve brought in some real quality this year, and with the loss of (Yohan) Cabaye last year, it was important to add some offensive stability to our team and to strengthen it.’

‘We’re really pleased with the work we’ve done but the proof is in the pudding and we need to deliver on Sunday at four o'clock against the champions but we’re looking forward to it. We’re in a good shape and we had a good pre-season.

‘I think we’re going to play a brand of football that Newcastle United fans expect because towards the back end of last year we just didn’t have enough offensive players to put on the kind of performances that we’re used to.

‘So this year we’ve got a lot of options from the bench, a big squad of good quality. Siem De Jong from Ajax, Cabella from France. A mixture of players, Jack (Colback) from just down the road, so we’ve looked out far and wide because it’s a difficult agenda for us to get players who are good enough to play on this stage.’
