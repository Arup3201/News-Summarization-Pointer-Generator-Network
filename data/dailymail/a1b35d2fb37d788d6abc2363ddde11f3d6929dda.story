A 28-year-old middle school teacher has surrendered to police after allegedly sending sexts, explicit photos and videos of sex acts to a 14-year-old male student. 

Whitney Blair Fetters, a Spanish teacher at Hefner Middle School in Putnam City, Oklahoma, handed herself into police on Wednesday after an arrest warrant was issued. 

Police moved in after it emerged that Fetters was planning to invite the boy over to spend the night with her while she was house-sitting on February 13 'so they could get high and have sex', according to investigators.

Whitney Blair Fetters, 28, a middle school teacher from Oklahoma, surrendered to police on Wednesday after she was arrested for indecent exposure and lewd proposals to a child younger than 16

Police moved in after it emerged that Fetters was planning to invite the boy over to spend the night with her while she was house-sitting on February 13 'so they could get high and have sex', according to investigators 

She faces charges of indecent exposure, lewd proposals to a child younger than 16, soliciting sexual conduct or communication with a minor by use of technology and a computer crimes act violation.

Temptation: The victim is believed to have sent the first sexually explicit message, telling Fetters (left and right) he thought she was 'hot'

She was released from Oklahoma County jail on Wednesday after posting $10,000 bail. 

Fetters graduated from the University of Central Oklahoma with a BA in Spanish.

According to public records, she is not married.

Fetter met the victim when he was 12 at the middle school and the two began sending each other harmless text messages. 

But police said what started out as an innocent exchange took a turn in December, when Fetters and the student allegedly began sending sexts and videos of sexual acts. 

Fetters allegedly sent the teenage boy nude photos of herself.

Police learned of the alleged relationship between Fetters and the minor in January when the student's parents found the pictures and contacted authorities.

Court documents cited by News9 indicated that the victim sent the first sexually explicit message, telling Fetters he thought she was 'hot.'

The text was accompanied by a partially nude photo of the boy.

Police said the pair proceeded to swap at least 20 X-rated photos, videos of themselves performing sex acts and explicit snap chats.

During a search of Fetters' family home, police seized her cell phone, computers, marijuana, and lingerie matching the photos found on the student's iPad. 

Documents revealed that the 14-year-old, who is now in high school, had made an attempt to cover up his relationship with the Spanish teacher.

He had tried to delete the explicit photos and videos, but police were able to collect and review all the evidence.

Officials learned of the allegations against the middle school teacher on January 30. 

Fetters was removed from her job at that time.

The station WSET reported that one text allegedly sent by Fetters to the boy read: ‘Touching myself is fun.’ 

Another featured a photo of the 28-year-old wearing only her underwear with a suggestive text that read, ‘That’s all you get.’

According to a statement from Putnam City Schools, they will fully cooperate with the Oklahoma City Police Department in the investigation.
