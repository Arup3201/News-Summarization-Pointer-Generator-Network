The images have been used throughout history, to define the bravery of First World War pilots who engaged in aerial combat over European skies.

But these stunning photos of the Great War - some of which show more than half a dozen aircrafts engaged in acrobatic dogfights - are actually the work of a crafty fraudster.

Despite being published in 1933 in the 'diary' of an anonymous pilot - who apparently took the photos using a camera attached to a machine gun - these impressive images were created by an American model-maker, who pocketed $20,000 through the scam.

These images of aerial battle scenes were first published in 1933 by Wesley D Archer in an anonymous diary apparently written by a flying corps pilot. But more than half a century later, experts discovered the images - and the words which went along with it - were actually fake

According to the Telegraph, Wesley D Archer, who served in the RAF, orchestrated the scenes using models of aircrafts which he suspended in the air using 'invisible' string and wires.

He later touched up the images, by superimposing other aircrafts onto the scene.

The photos were then published in Death in the Air: The War Diary and Photographs of a Flying Corps Pilot.

At the time of publication, Mr Archer said the anonymous pilot who wrote the diary could not be named, because he had defied military convention by taking his camera into aerial battle.

Mr Archer described in the book's foreword how the photographs had been taken by a camera which was attached to the machine gun of the pilot's aircraft.

Dedicating the book to those who had 'survived years of conflict and struggled over enemy lines', Mr Archer said that permission was only given for the photos to be used, on condition of the pilot's anonymity.

Mr Archer, who served in the RAF but later became a set-designer and model maker, created the images from his studio using models of aircrafts and 'invisible' string. The scam made him and his wife Betty some $20,000

After the book's publication, the impressive images were used in books, magazines and newspapers all over the world.

But, more than half a century later, it emerged that every photograph  - and the apparently personal words which went along with it - were made up.

The scam was first unveiled in 1985 in the Cross and Cockade, the magazine of the Society
 of World War 1 Aero Historians.

But, because of the magazine's small circulation, the photographs continued to fool the world until the Smithsonian National Air and 
Space Museum in Washington DC received documents from a friend of Mr 
Archer, after his death. 

These images, pictured left, were published in Death in the Air: The War Diary and Photographs of a Flying Corps Pilot, pictured right. A spokesman for the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum said it accepted the photographs were fake

While going through his personal documents, the experts came across photo negatives and letter from the 'Cockburn-Lange' collection of photos, which apparently belonged to someone called 'Gladys Maud Cockburn-Lange'.

They soon discovered it was a pseudonym for his wife Betty Archer - who had also been in on the scam. 

Mr Archer died in Cuba in 1955 and his widow four years later, unaware their secret would soon be discovered.

Former reconnaissance pilot Jimmy 
Taylor, now 91, who served in the RAF during the Second World War, was 
one of many who bought Mr Archer's book.

The former university lecturer told the Telegraph he had no idea the photos were fake until the scam was revealed.

But he said he felt admiration towards Mr Archer for his 'brilliant deception'.

A spokesman for the Smithsonian accepted the photographs were faked.
