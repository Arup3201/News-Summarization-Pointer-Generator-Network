A new county cricket season is almost upon us with the first round of Championship fixtures this summer beginning on Sunday up and down the country. 

Yorkshire will be looking to defend their Division One title while Kevin Pietersen will hope his runs help Surrey to promotion from the second tier. 

Here is former Surrey and England batsman Mark Butcher's guide to the County Championship.

DIVISION ONE

Durham

Verdict: I don’t think they have the strength to carry the title off. The best they can hope for is to consolidate their status as a regular Division One side. But they always have a flotilla of pace bowlers to look out for.

Key man: Mark Wood – a highly promising quick, as England have realised.

Overseas: John Hastings (Aus)

Hampshire

Verdict: It’s always difficult for any team that’s just been promoted: Worcestershire go up and down every year. But if West Indies paceman Fidel Edwards, signed as a Kolpak, can stay fit they have a chance. And Michael Carberry will have a point to prove as well.

Key man: It would be fantastic if Sean Ervine can make the most of his undoubted talent.

Overseas: Jackson Bird (Aus), Yasir Arafat (Pak, limited-overs)

Middlesex

Verdict: I tipped them for the title last season, but they barely ended up escaping relegation. The loss of Adam Voges to Australia’s Ashes squad is a big blow, and they’ll need to replace the runs of his fellow Ashes tourist Chris Rogers at the top of the order.

Key man: The return of a revitalised Nick Compton from Somerset is huge.

Overseas: TBC

Nottinghamshire

Verdict: They promised much in 2014, but delivered little. Yorkshire overhauled them easily in the end. But I expect them to be strong, especially in seam bowling: Vernon Philander’s a big signing, and they’ll have the experienced Ben Hilfenhaus too.

Key man: This is Alex Hales’s chance to prove he can be more than just a one-day hitter.

Overseas: Vernon Philander (SA), Ben Hilfenhaus (Aus), Darren Sammy (WI, T20)

Big things will be expected of Nottinghamshire in the 2015 season given their strength and depth

Somerset

Verdict: With the likes of Marcus Trescothick, they have a wealth of experience at Taunton now, which they’ll need – they’ve often struggled to get over the line because of a lack of cricketing nous. But they’re brimming with talent, and the Overton twins – Craig and Jamie – will be worth watching.

Key man: The new coach Matthew Maynard – his edge is just what they need.

Overseas: Abdur Rehman (Pak), Sohail Tanvir (Pak, T20), Corey Anderson (NZ, T20).

Sussex

Verdict: My tip for the title. Ed Joyce is back from another successful World Cup with Ireland, and they’ll have Tymal Mills to steam in down the hill: lefties are all the rage right now. Throw in Chris Jordan, Luke Wright, Steve Magoffin and Mahela Jayawardene, and there’s a heap of talent.

Key man: Magoffin’s accurate seam bowling is one of the game’s most unsung phenomena.

Overseas: Steve Magoffin (Aus), Mahela Jayawardene (SL, T20)

Warwickshire

Verdict: They had a cracking summer last year, and they have a nice blend of experienced players and others approaching their peak, in the 27-31 category. They’ll need to keep the squad fit so they can rotate – and it’ll be interesting to see how much of Jonathan Trott they’ll get, because he’ll have an eye on the Ashes.

Key man: Jeetan Patel – 59 Championship wickets last year with his off-breaks.

Overseas: Jeetan Patel (NZ), Brendon McCullum (NZ, T20)

Worcestershire

Verdict: It often confounds me how a team that looks so workmanlike on paper can keep appearing in Division One ahead of more fancied sides, but coach Steve Rhodes gets them playing disciplined cricket, and Daryl Mitchell’s a terrific leader.

Key man: If the pitches are dry in the second half of the season, Saeed Ajmal could keep them up by himself.

Overseas: Sachithra Senanayake (SL), Saeed Ajmal (Pak), Colin Munro (NZ, T20)

Yorkshire

Verdict: Their biggest challenge in defending their title will be how to cope with losing so many players to England. But well done to them for fulfilling a major part of a county’s brief, which is to produce Test cricketers. And it’s a predominantly Yorkshire-born team too.

Key man: Andrew Gale – the captain will be ever-present while others are on England duty.

Overseas: Cheteshwar Pujara (Ind), Aaron Finch (Aus), Kane Williamson (NZ), Glenn Maxwell (Aus, T20)

DIVISION TWO 

Derbyshire

Verdict: Martin Guptill will arrive fresh from his World Cup heroics, and last season Mark Footitt was far and away the quickest bowler on the county circuit. They’ll be a tough nut to crack.

Key man: Mark Footitt was the Championships’ leading wicket-taker in 2014 with 82 at 19 each.

Overseas: Martin Guptill (NZ), Tillekeratne Dilshan (SL, T20), Nathan Rimmington (Aus, T20)

Essex

Verdict: Somehow, they always manage to mess up their promotion bid. Jesse Ryder will give them a bit of X-factor, but they’ve lost two talented young players in Tymal Mills and wicketkeeper Ben Foakes.

Key man: Graham Napier – potentially destructive with both bat and ball.

Overseas: Jesse Ryder (NZ), Shaun Tait (Aus, T20)

Glamorgan

Verdict: They’ve been finding life very difficult of late, and they’ve had a bit of an overhaul during the winter. Having Jacques Rudolph available for the whole season is a boost, and South African batsman Colin Ingram has arrived as a Kolpak.

Key man: Graham Wagg is a feisty all-rounder.

Overseas: Jacques Rudolph (SA)

Glamorgan have endured a tough time of late and will be hoping for better fortunes in 2015

Gloucestershire

Verdict: The loss of the Gidman brothers – Alex and Will – leaves a big hole in the side, both on and off the field. It’s interesting that Geraint Jones will captain them in four-day cricket, but it’s hard to see them improving on their seventh-place finish from last year.

Key player: Will Tavare's runs could be crucial.

Overseas: Peter Handscomb (Aus), Michael Klinger (Aus)

Kent

Verdict: As ever, their problem will be how to take 20 wickets, but at least seamer Matt Coles is back from Hampshire. The batting looks stronger, with Joe Denly rejoining from Middlesex, and young talent in Daniel Bell-Drummond and Sam Northeast.

Key player: Sam Billings – an England star in the making.

Overseas: TBC

Lancashire

Verdict: They had a massively disappointing 2014, going straight back down after winning Division Two. But, along with Surrey, they’ll fancy their chances of promotion. And their new coach, Ashley Giles, will be keen as mustard after being discarded by England.

Key player: Tom Smith – showed his all-round class last summer.

Overseas: Peter Siddle (Aus)

Lancashire endured a disappointing 2014 campaign which ended in relegation back to Division Two

Leicestershire

Verdict: They were rock bottom last year, and without a Championship win in two seasons, but there’s a feeling of renewal at Grace Road: a new chief executive in Wasim Khan, and three Australians in Andrew McDonald (coach), Mark Cosgrove (captain) and Clint McKay (seamer).

Key player: Cosgrove can give Leicestershire some rollicking starts.

Overseas: Clint McKay (Aus)

Northamptonshire

Verdict: They’ll be wiser for the experience after a dismal 2014, when a pre-season injury to captain Alex Wakely proved a disaster. Time to prove that they can rediscover the form that made them such a hit in 2013.

Key player: Local lad David Willey bowls brisk left-arm and gives it a whack.

Overseas: Rory Kleinveldt (SA), Shahid Afridi (Pak, T20)

Pakistan all-rounder Shahid Afridi will play T20 cricket for Northamptonshire this summer

Surrey

Verdict: The KP circus is coming to town. There’ll be plenty of attention on the club, and therefore also on the talented younger players – the likes of Jason Roy, Rory Burns, Zafar Ansari and Matt Dunn. They’ve simply got to get out of Division Two.

Key player: Jason Roy – a big chance to nudge the England selectors.

Overseas: Kumar Sangakkara (SL), Moises Henriques (Aus)
