Whitney Houston's daughter Bobbi Kristina Brown was revived on Saturday morning after being found face down and unconscious  in a bath tub full of water.

But the 21-year-old remains in a medically induced coma suffering from swelling on the brain, reports TMZ. 

Bobbi was discovered at home by her husband Nick Gordon who began CPR before police took over as they awaited an ambulance.

In an eerie co-incidence, her mother was found dead almost three years ago when she accidentally drowned in a bath tub at the Beverly Hills Hilton Hotel - she too was face down.

Her father Bobby Brown is currently by her side along with family friend Tyler Perry.

According to local reports, the emergency services were called to Bobbi and Nick's home in Roswell Georgia at 10.25am on Saturday. It is the same house they shared with her mother.

The reality star was rushed to a hospital where her condition is now described as stable in the intensive care unit.

In a statement the Roswell Police Department said: 'Her husband and a friend located her in a bath tub this morning and she was unresponsive. 

'He started CPR and a police officer took over life-saving measures until an ambulance arrived.'

The friend telephoned for help as Gordon worked at saving his wife.

Having fun: Hours before she was found, Bobbi posted a snap of herself with a friend at her home, writing 'YAYYYY :) finally my famBAM!!!'

Taken to the Emergency Room: The reality star arrived here at  North Fulton Hospital on Saturday morning

The unresponsive reality TV star was immediately transferred to North Fulton Hospital where she is still being treated in ICU, according to TMZ who describe her current condition as stable.

It is as yet unclear what caused her collapse and a police search of the home turned up no drugs.

'Obviously we all know her mom died this very same way,' said Lisa Holland of the Roswell PD.

'Can't say how sad this is. It's a difficult situation for police officer to perform CPR on any person.'

At a press conference outside the hospital on Saturday afternoon Holland confirmed 'she is still alive and breathing. Other than that, I don't know her condition.'

She added that nobody knows what caused her collapse but that, police are talking to friends and family and obtaining a search warrant so they can look through the residence.

'We don't know if this was a medical condition where she had a problem in the tub or if it was any type of self-initiated or overdose type of situation,' Holland admitted.

Police were last called to the home on January 23rd after a 'reported fight,' but officers found no one home when they arrived. 

I Will Always Love You: Bobbi tweeted an emotional message to her dead mother on January 26th

Anniversary looming: 

'She's been through a lot, you know what I'm saying. This is a hard time, it's her mother's anniversary of her death. It's been a hard time, it's a rough time of year,' Jerod Brown, who said he was Bobbi Kristina Brown's first cousin, told NBC News. 

'But she's a tiger, she's going to pull through it.'

He then added; 'Kris has been doing well, working out. She's been in the gym, doing cardio. ... Swimming a lot, getting her vocals right for this album that she's about to come out with.' 

Another cousin, YF Kennedy, told E! News; 'Krissi doesn't do drugs. She hasn't been drinking or doing drugs and she's cut down on cigarettes. She's been trying to get her music together and keep her voice clean. Her voice is so beautiful.'

Kennedy also said; 'She's still been going through the grieving stages but is trying to keep her spirits up. She's been going to the gym every day with her husband and trying to be happy. She swims a lot.'

'Kris has been doing well, working out. She's been in the gym, doing cardio. ... Swimming a lot, getting her vocals right for this album that she's about to come out with,' said Bobbi's cousin

On January 26th, Whitney's daughter made reference to the upcoming anniversary with an emotional tweet.

She posted: 'Littlelady & yourgrowing young man @nickgordon miss you mommy so much...loving you more every sec, #Anniversary!'

Speaking to Oprah Winfrey about her mother’s death in March 2012, Bobbi said: ‘It’s so surreal sometimes. I still walk in the house and call her name.

‘She’s always with me. I can always feel her with me.

‘She used to say, “Do you need me?” and I would say, “I always need you.’”

In a heart-wrenching admission, Bobbi said she can’t bring herself to listen to her mother’s songs. ‘I can hear her voice telling me to keep moving, baby – I gotcha.

Her mother Whitney died on February 11th, 2012 hours before she was due to attend a pre Grammy Awards party.

The Los Angeles County coroner’s office later confirmed the I Will Always Love You hitmaker passed away as a result of drowning and 'effects of atherosclerotic heart disease and cocaine use'.

The cause of Bobbi’s incident is currently unknown, but local police are investigating the situation at her home while she recovers in hospital. 

The death of her mother left Bobbi distraught, and this is not the first time emergency services have had to intervene.

Indeed just two days after the first anniversary of Whitney's death, Bobbi  was pictured being taken from her then home in Los Angeles on a stretcher appearing unconscious.

She was hospitalised for treatment, after mixing alcohol with a sedative.

Even before Whitney died  Bobbi was the subject of rumours as to her alleged use of drugs.

In March 2011 Bobbi took to Twitter to deny claims she had checked into rehab after pictures surfaced that allegedly showed her snorting lines of cocaine.

At the time her mother was said to have desperately pushed the teenager to seek treatment soon after, with no success.

'Excuse me,' Bobbi Kristina tweeted, 'but I’d like to say that I am NOT going to rehab? I’m perfectly healthy and I am not addicted to anything but life.'

The National Enquirer, which published the scandalous pictures, reported that Whitney had attempted an intervention of sorts.

Further pictures published by the tabloid in March 2012 shortly after Whitney's death showed Bobbi apparently using a three-foot bong to smoke marijuana.

A recent Lifetime biopic of Whitney focused heavily on her drug use, received mixed reviews from viewers.

Bobbi did not comment on the movie after it aired earlier this month, although she had expressed her displeasure in advance.

Her grandmother Cissy was the most outspoken, angrily objecting to the movie even being made.

'Lifetime has chosen to go ahead with the movie about Whitney in spite of my family's objections,' the bereaved mother said in a statement to Entertainment Tonight in June.

'No one connected with this movie knew Whitney or anything about her relationship with Bobby.'

After her mother's death, Bobbi began a relationship with Nick who was described as like being a brother to her as she grew up.

The couple married in January 2014 but faced criticism after it emerged they had shared a home since before they were teens.

But they have insisted they are not blood related and are not even connected in any family way as Gordon was never adopted by Houston.

In late January Nick told Extra the jabs 'put a fire in us' and added: 'The critics can say whatever they want to say… it's like we have a force field and that s**t's just bouncing off of it.'

The two became friends when Whitney asked Nick, who was going through a rough time, to move in with them when he was only 12 years old.

But the relationship heightened a rift between her and her grandmother, Cissy who she fell out with when the matriach announced plans to write a book about her tragic daughter's life.

And in July 2013, Cissy penned an open letter to her granddaughter airing her concerns about her well-being.

She wrote: Krissi, all I want for you is your good health and your happiness.

'Do I want you to get married in the near future? No, I don't. I think you're too young and I wish you'd wait.

'But that's because I'm Grandma," she continues. 'I'm supposed to worry about you. I'm supposed to wonder if Nick or ANY man is good enough for you, My Baby's Baby.'
