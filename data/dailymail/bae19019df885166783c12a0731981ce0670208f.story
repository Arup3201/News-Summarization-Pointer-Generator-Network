A mother-of-two has a terrifying condition which causes her body to swell up so dramatically she looks like she has been punched,

Izzy Richards, 32, has an extremely rare and potentially fatal genetic condition called hereditary angioedema.

This causes her hands, legs, face, stomach and back swell regularly and, worryingly, her tongue and throat can also swell up, meaning she struggles to breathe because her airways are constricted.

Izzy Richards, 32, has a rare condition which causes different parts of her body to swell up dramatically

The condition can affect Ms Richards' legs, hands, face, stomach and back. She said:' People think my partner Chris (right) has hit me - it's so humiliating for both of us'

She told MailOnline: ‘It is terrifying when my tongue and throat swell up.

‘Once my tongue did it and doctors thought I was a goner – I couldn’t breathe and I thought I was going to die.

'And when my face swells up it's really humiliating - people stare at me and assume my partner Chris has hit me.

'I get very defensive and I don't like going out when it's swollen.'

Ms Richards, from Nottingham, started to experience symptoms when she was just four.

She suffered a bout of German measles and her knees swelled up for a few days.

The condition can also cause Ms Richards' tongue and throat to swell up making it hard for her to breathe

However, at the time, her symptoms were dismissed as an allergic reaction to the medication she was given for the illness.

She then experienced no more symptoms until she was seven.

At this point, her hands swelled up temporarily but again her symptoms were dismissed – this time as a reaction to a cold she was suffering from.

When she was 14 or 15 her condition became much more severe.

She started to suffer crippling stomach cramps and vomiting for about three weeks in every four.

The condition is a rare inherited disease that causes swelling in various body tissues.

Some people have many attacks each month, while others will go months or years without a swelling attack.

The swelling is caused by the poor functioning, or lack of, a protein in the immune system.

If a person does not have enough of it, blood vessels can become leaky, allowing fluid to build up in the tissues.

This can cause swelling anywhere in the body but is most common in the limbs, intestines, face and voice box.

The
 swelling in the intestines often causes severe stomach cramps and 
swelling in the voice box can be life-threatening if it causes the 
airway to be blocked.

The illness is inherited and a person can develop it if just one parent is a carrier.

In this situation, the child will have a 50 per cent chance of developing it.

There is no cure but it can often be managed by avoiding triggers and taking medication.

Triggers can include stress and some medications.

During this time she also occasionally noticed that her legs would swell up.

As a result of her illness, she was barely able to attend school and left with very few qualifications.

She says that despite the severity of her symptoms, doctors never really investigated her illness thoroughly.

Over the years, she was given various diagnoses including a virus and iirritable bowel syndrome.

Ms Richards’ mother experienced similar symptoms so believed she and her daughter must have a genetic condition which caused them to be allergic to their own hormones.

When Ms Richards, a customer services executive, was 16 her face swelled up for the first time and the swelling spread to her throat.

She said: ‘I was choking on what I was saying – I couldn’t get any words out. It was terrifying.

‘I felt like I had something caught in my windpipe.’

Finally, when Ms Richards was 21, she saw a locum GP who noticed her hands were swollen.

He asked her about the swelling and she explained the symptoms she'd been suffering from for so many years.

Amazingly, this doctor believed he knew of a very rare condition she could be suffering from.

He took some blood tests and a couple of weeks later, she was diagnosed with hereditary angioedema (HAE).

The condition is a rare inherited disease that causes swelling in various body tissues.

In Ms Richards’ case, the swelling tends to be triggered by stress.

Some people have many attacks each month, while others will go months or years without a swelling attack.

Ms Richards says the swelling on her face is sometimes so bad that people think she has been punched

The swelling is caused by the poor functioning, or lack of, a protein in the immune system.

If a person does not have enough of it, blood vessels can become leaky, allowing fluid to build up in the tissues.

This can cause swelling anywhere in the body but is most common in the limbs, intestines, face and voice box.

The swelling in the intestines often causes severe stomach cramps and swelling in the voice box can be life-threatening if it causes the airway to be blocked.

She said: ‘It was a bit surreal to be diagnosed after all those years but it was a relief to know what it was.

‘It was also scary because I then knew the full extent of my illness.

Ms Richards first experienced symptoms when she was four but she wasn't diagnosed until she was 21

‘I was also a bit annoyed that I had been misdiagnosed so many times.’

As the condition is genetic, Ms Richards’ mother was also tested for it and the results confirmed her symptoms were also caused by hereditary angioedema.

By this time, Ms Richards had two daughters – who are now 14 and 11 – and devastatingly, they were both diagnosed with the condition as well.

Ms Richards said: ‘It was guilt beyond belief when they were diagnosed – I couldn’t believe I'd cursed them for life.’

Today Ms Richards, who lives with her partner Chris, still experiences swelling every couple of weeks and each time it happens it lasts for a few days.

Ms Richards has to use walking sticks to help her get around when her legs have swollen up

'Sometimes the stomach cramps are so painful I can't walk, and need crutches when my legs swell.'

However, 
things have improved slightly for Ms Richards as, since her diagnosis, 
she has been taught how to give herself an injection when she starts to 
swell up.

These injections prevent the swelling worsening after it has started, but they do not stop it altogether.

When Ms Richards' hands swell she loses her dexterity, and when her feet swell she struggles to get shoes on

She said: ‘My medication has never failed me yet but I am terrified that one day it could – if I left it too long when my tongue was swelling it could one day not work.

‘My partner gets really very worried – he is very attentive and will do everything he can to help me but I would like to think that maybe one day they could cure it.

‘I don’t think anyone should have to suffer with it.’

She added: ‘I want to raise awareness so everyone who has it gets diagnosed and gets the treatment they need.’
