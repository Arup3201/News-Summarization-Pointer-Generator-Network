Betty Faulkner said she was devastated when she was told she buried her husband David without his heart

A woman who buried her husband 14 years ago was devastated to discover that the hospital that treated him had kept his heart.

Betty Faulkner said she is still searching for answers about why her husband David's heart was left in a jar in a morgue.

Mr Faulkner died aged 54 in 1999 after a heart attack, leaving behind his wife and their three children Darren, David and Lisa.

Mrs Faulkner, 63, from Worcestershire, said she would never have buried her husband if she had known his heart was missing.

She said: 'I just couldn't believe it when they told
me. My husband's heart had been sat in a jar in the morgue for 12 years
and I didn't even know.'

Police told her about the error in March 2010 following an audit at Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust.

Mrs Faulkner then had her husband reburied.

She said: 'If it had been any other part of the body I would have left it, but I couldn't leave him without his heart, it's the most important part of him.'

The heart was discovered in a police audit of body parts retained in hospitals without their relative's knowledge, ordered in 2010.

Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust claim that the heart was stored at the request of the coroner's pathologist but that the coroner was unaware that this had occurred.

Mrs Faulkner said: 'I was devastated, shocked and angry, I just couldn't believe this had happened to me.

'My daughter said I went completely white when they told me, I felt sick.

'I was given £260 to hold a second funeral, but it just isn't enough, they lost my husband's heart.

'When you've buried your husband once you don't expect to have to do it again.'

The family buried the heart next to David's grave in a ceremony on the couple's wedding anniversary but Mrs Faulkner remains frustrated that she has been given no proper explanation.

She said: 'The police were running backwards and forwards to my house for weeks but nobody could tell me what actually happened.

'I kept on trying to find out from the hospital, I asked them how they would feel if it was their husband or their Dad.

'I don't think I will ever find out the truth now, I don't want anyone else to have to go through the pain that I did.'
