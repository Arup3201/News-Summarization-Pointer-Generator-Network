Given it is his job to oversee the Arts, you might expect him to keep up to date with the BBC’s output.

But Ed Vaizey, minister for culture and the digital economy, has admitted he never listens to the broadcaster’s high-brow classical music station Radio 3.

The Tory MP, who serves under culture secretary Sajid Javid, revealed he listens to independent rival Classic FM instead because it ‘plays lovely music’ and is ‘accessible and informal’.

Mr Vaizey, 46, also warned yesterday that radio stations are at risk of losing younger listeners.

He said he was troubled by a recent report by regulator Ofcom, which found average weekly radio listening among 15 to 24-year-olds has dropped from 18.7 hours in 2007 to 15.5 hours in 2013 – a fall of almost a fifth.

Speaking at the Radio Festival in Salford, Greater Manchester, he said he believed young people still enjoy listening to radio but choose to do so over the internet instead of traditional radio sets.

He insisted that it is important to make it easier to access radio on mobile phones, and said the Government and the BBC will urge smartphone manufacturers to build tuners into handsets to enable them to receive a ‘hybrid’ of digital, FM and internet radio.

‘A multi-platform approach and a strong social media presence is essential for radio to increase reach and engagement with new audiences,’ he added.

When asked if he listens to Radio 3, Mr Vaizey said: ‘No, because I love Classic FM. It’s an absolutely brilliant station – I love it. It plays lovely music and is run by an amazing person.

‘What’s wrong with Radio 3? That’s a real half-empty question. The question is, what’s right with Classic FM? It plays music I love in an accessible and informal fashion.’

He added: ‘I’m not being paid by Classic FM. It’s sounding too much like a plug let’s stop it right there.’
