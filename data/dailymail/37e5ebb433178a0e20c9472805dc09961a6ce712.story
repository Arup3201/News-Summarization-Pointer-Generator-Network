Former members of Rob Ford’s staff told Toronto Police that they saw him drink 20 ounces of vodka, snort cocaine, smoke weed, and take OxyContin while spending time with a suspected prostitute on St. Patrick's Day last year, according to reports released on Wednesday.

The police documents were made public on the same day that Ford admitted to the Toronto City Council that he had bought illegal drugs.

According to the documents, former Ford staffer, Issac Ransom, told police that, on the night of March 17, 2012, he saw Ford drink half of a 40 ounce bottle of vodka while hanging out with an escort and talking about how he was going to get laid. Ford was also smoking pot, according to Ransom.

Ransom tried to convince Ford to stay in, but the mayor insisted on going to a St. Patrick's Day event at Bier Markt, a Toronto restaurant, where his night became more debauched.

According to the police documents, a waiter said he saw Ford and a woman with their heads down, trying to hide what they were doing, and then heard ‘two sniffs’.

He was told by a Ford staffer not to tell anyone what he had seen - which he said confirmed for him that he had seen the mayor do coke, reports the Toronto Sun.

According to the documents, there were four or five people in the private room including some women who didn't appear to be staffers. About an hour and a half later, the waiter heard that Ford went to the dance floor and pushed people out of the way.

When
Ford returned to his office after the event, he shoved two staffers who
told him he should go home, according to the report. One of those 
staffers, Earl Provost, would later say he witnessed Ford taking 
Oxycontin before the same event.

Ford's
staff also told police that some women came to the mayor's office 
saying Ford had told them they could have a job after they smoked joints
with him outside of bars.

On
Wednesday, Justice Ian Nodheimer ruled that some of the redacted 
sections of the police report, which was used to obtain a search warrant
of Ford's friend Alexander Lisi, could be made publicly available.

Earlier
in the day Toronto City Council had asked embattled Ford to take a 
break from his job to deal with ‘personal issues’, which he admits 
include both buying illegal drugs and smoking crack cocaine.

The
nonbinding vote came on a day during which both Ford's opponents and 
his former allies interrogated the mayor on his suitability to lead 
Canada's largest city. Ford said he won't quit.

‘I
am not an addict of any sort, so I am not quite sure why you are saying
that I need help,’ Ford told councilors during an hour-long grilling.

Speaking after the vote, he issued the latest in a string of apologies, and added: ‘I really effed up.’

Ford,
elected in 2010 on a promise to end the City Hall ‘gravy train’, 
admitted last week that he had smoked crack cocaine in ‘one of my 
drunken stupors’.

He 
insisted on Wednesday he has zero tolerance for drugs and gangs. But 
asked if he had bought illegal drugs in the past two years, he paused 
for several seconds and replied somberly: ‘Yes, I have.’

He then he protested that he was 'a positive role model for kids who are down and out.'

That
didn’t prevent councilors voting 37-5 in favor of a formal, but 
nonbinding, motion urging Ford to take a leave of absence, and also 
urged him to apologize for ‘misleading’ Toronto residents.

‘There's
no question that the residents of this city are opposed to the mayor's 
behavior. I am, you are, we are,’ Councilor Karen Stintz said.

‘Because
of the mayor's behavior, I'm explaining to my nine-year old what crack 
cocaine is. Because of my mayor I'm explaining that it's not okay to lie
and then apologize when you get caught.’

Council
has no power to force the mayor to step down or take a break from his 
job unless he is convicted of a crime. Ford insists he has no plans to 
go, or to seek treatment.

As
the questions continued at council, hundreds of protesters gathered 
outside City Hall, many of them calling on Ford to step down.

An
Ipsos-Reid poll conducted for several TV and radio stations showed that
76 percent of Toronto voters think Ford should step down or take a 
leave of absence, while only 24 percent agreed with Ford's insistence on
staying in his job.
