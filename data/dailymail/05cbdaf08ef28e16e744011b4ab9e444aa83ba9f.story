Their faces painted red with crimson ochre and impressive set of brightly coloured feathers swaying on the top of their heads, these Samburu dancers wear elaborate headdresses beautiful enough to put the efforts of the Glastonbury crowd to shame.

Living in Kenya's magnificent Rift Valley, a place of towering escarpments, flamingo-filled soda lakes and abundant wildlife, the Samburu are one of the country's most fascinating tribes, famous for their incredible jewellery and interesting customs.

And the feather headdresses are symbolic of one particularly important tradition, according to photographer Eric Lafforgue. 'The guys who wear feather headdresses have just been circumcised,' he explains. 'They aren't allowed to meet women.'

Spectacular: These Samburu men are recently circumcised, a fact made plain by their elaborate feathered headdresses, and cannot spend time with women

No comparison: Glastonbury goer Ria Hebden might look pretty in her feathered headdress but its not quite as impressive as the ones belonging to the Samburu

What's more, the feather-wearing men aren't the only ones to be banned from enjoying female company. The Loikop, as the Samburu are known 
among themselves, live in one of the world's only remaining gerontocracies,
 with the power of the tribal elders underpinned by a belief in their 
ability to lay curses on miscreants.

As a result, they monopolise tribal business, including making arrangements for marriages. With many choosing to take extra wives themselves at the expense of younger men, the elders' rule isn't always popular.

Discontent occasionally spills over into discord, with cattle stealing and wife-pinching popular pastimes among the Samburu's bachelor groups forced to live without families.

While the odd bout of social strife might make headlines in the local press, abroad, the Samburu are more famous for their beautiful jewellery and have some interesting customs when it comes to choosing what to wear.

Important: While men wear these impressive feathered headpieces, they are not allowed anywhere near women - an occasional source of conflict

Looking good: Samburu tribesmen show off their impressively large beaded collars and ostrich feather and egg shell headpieces

Colourful: Along with elaborate feather 
headdresses, Samburu and their close kin, the Rendille, also wear piles 
of bright beaded jewellery made by the women

Colourful: A man paints his face with make-up - a habit that led to the Samburu tribe being given their name which translates from Maa as 'butterfly'

Until recently, discarding the 
traditional tribal loincloth in favour of Western-style trousers was 
considered unmanly and as a result, the majority of Samburu men still 
wear colourful tartan shukkas as they go about their business.

Like their close relations, the Maasai tribe, the men of both Samburu and Rendille tribes also pile on impressive amounts of jewellery, with beaded necklaces, elaborate headdresses and stacks of brightly coloured bracelets all popular.

Women too wear huge amounts of jewellery, most famously their ornate beaded collars, and make most of the jewellery, including their menfolks', by hand.

Along with the men, they also paint their faces using concoctions made from ground chalk and ochre and use it to accentuate their best features - much to the delight of nearby tribes who gave the Samburu their name, which translates from the Maasai language, Maa, as 'butterfly'.

Handmade: All of the headdresses and jewellery worn by Samburu and Rendille men are made by the women of the tribe

Hard work: Most of the elaborate beaded adornments take hours of work to complete, although the traditional collars worn by women take almost as long

Looking good: A Samburu man checks his crimson make-up in an incongruous pink hand mirror, as he gets ready to participate in a traditional circumcision ritual

Tradition: The Samburu's feathered headdresses are better than anything found at Glastonbury, and right, men use ochre to dye their hair red

Stylish: Men in traditional clothes, including saffron yellow tunics, a vast beaded collar and polished ostrich shell earrings

Ritual: The beaded headdresses show that the men are going through a traditional circumcision ritual - and cannot be in female company

Each June, Lake Turkana plays host to a unique gathering of tribes, with the Samburu, Maasai and Pokot among those to join the Turkana in showing off their culture to visitors. See laketurkanafestival.com for more information.

But the Maasai too have no shortage of 
spectacular jewellery - in particular the incredible enkuraru 
headdresses crafted from ostrich feathers and worn by warriors yet to 
kill their first lion.

Originally created for use during raids and wars, thanks to the psychological advantage offered by their height, most are now worn purely for major ceremonies and dances.

Other Kenyan tribes to make the most of the abundance of feathers to be found are the Turkana and the Kalenjin - both of whom live in the arid northwestern reaches of the Rift Valley.

The Turkana, whose lands border those of the Pokot people and the Ugandan Karamojong tribe, are famous for their athletic prowess and for their beautiful women - among them Victoria's Secret model Ajuma Nasenyana.

Less colourful than the Samburu and the Maasai, the tribe is nevertheless fond of elaborately decorated clothing, with women wearing stunning animal skin tunics embroidered with polished ostrich shell.

Men, meanwhile, brighten up their look using crimson dye made from local ochre rocks to colour their hair, and like the throng of people heading to Glastonbury, pile on huge amounts of bright beaded jewellery.

But while the Glastonbury crowds' embrace of headdresses and piles of jewellery only lasts four days, for the Turkana, Samburu, Maasai and Kalenjin, gorgeous festival-style jewels are a year-round sight.

Impressive: The men ululate and dance wildly as one of their number plays a flute made from a polished and hollowed out cow horn

Ensemble: In addition to their amazing headdresses, Samburu and Rendille men also wear striking striped socks and beautifully embroidered kikoy wraps

Sunset: The circumcision celebration continues all day, only finishing at sunset. Both Samburu and Rendille men are involved in the ritual

Meet the neighbours: The tribes of the Rift Valley share their home with an incredible array of wildlife, among them big cats such as lions and in this case, cheetahs

Adorable: Joining the cheetahs, lions and humans of the Rift Valley (and providing supper for all three) are antelopes, among them the tiny dik dik (pictured)
