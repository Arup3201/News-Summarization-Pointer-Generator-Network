Max Clifford went into work today as he remains on bail ahead of his sentencing hearing on Friday

Victims of disgraced PR expert Max Clifford could sue him for his millions following his convictions for indecent assault.

The 71-year-old was found guilty of carrying out sex attacks on four victims yesterday, with a jury clearing him of assaults on two other women.

The convictions, the first under the Operation Yewtree investigation set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal, could now pave the way for a string of civil law suits.

Lawyers say the jury's verdicts will strengthen any case for damages brought before civil courts, with victims able to claim damages for any trauma or potential loss of earnings  caused by his offences.

Liz Dux, who represents over 150 complainants in the Yewtree inquiry for law firm Slater and Gordon, said: 'The victims have already proven their case to the higher standard of proof required in a criminal trial, so would have good grounds to bring a civil case.

'They will have to make claims against him individually rather than any organisation, but he is a man of significant assets.'

It emerged yesterday that there were 23 alleged victims who came forward to police, but prosecutors decided to proceed only with what they perceived to be the strongest cases.

Experts say the civil claims may not be limited to those accusers whose claims led to conviction, meaning other women could also sue Clifford.

Tracey Story, expert in abuse claims at law firm Irwin Mitchell, added: 'Others may not have as strong a case, but the standard of proof is lower in civil proceedings so, it would be a challenge for them, but it doesn't necessarily mean their cases would fail.

'The time limit for bringing claims of this kind is the victim's 21st birthday or three years from the date of the abuse.

'But exceptions are made in cases where victims can still get a fair hearing. The fact that there has so recently been a fair trial of the facts in this case means victims would have a very strong claim that they are still in time.'

The Metropolitan Police refused to confirm whether further alleged victims have come forward since Clifford's conviction yesterday.

Clifford has two large homes in Hersham, Sussex, one he valued at £3.5million in 2008 and another, which his daughter Louise lives in, he valued at £2.5million five years ago.

The Land Registry says property prices in the area have increased by around five per cent a year since then, meaning the two homes could now have a combined worth of up to £8million.

The PR expert also has a house in an exclusive golf development in the hills near Nuevo Andalucia, southern Spain, which he valued at £1.5million in 2008.

Clifford has said he made £2.5million a year from his PR work. The latest accounts for his company, Max Clifford Associates, in 2012 show a turnover of around £3.5million and give the firm an estimated worth of £1.2million.

Clifford has also boasted he gets a new Bentley - each worth £200,000 - every two years.

The disgraced publicist was seen arriving at his scaled-down offices in Weybridge, Surrey today, a far cry from his former palatial HQ in London's West End.

Neighbours said they thought he would stay at home while he awaits his sentencing hearing on Friday and were surprised to see him out and about.

One local, who asked not to be named said: 'You would have thought he'd keep his head down knowing the fate awaiting him but his appearance today in public only underscores his arrogance.'

Clifford has said his lawyers have advised him not to comment on his situation.

Prosecutors are still deciding how to deal with one count of indecent assault upon which the jury could not reach a verdict. Clifford continues to deny that charge.
