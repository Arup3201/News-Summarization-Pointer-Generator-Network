Muse: Jennifer Trouton is friends with erotic novellist E L James

When your granny mentions her haggard old mop bucket or tea-leaf tin, the last place you think they'll end up is in an erotic novel.

But for one County Down artist, her paintings have been immortalised in the pages of Fifty Shades Of Grey, the saucy story that has raised eyebrows – and pulses – around the world.

Jennifer Trouton, 40, is good friends with the book's author, E L James – real name Erika Mitchell – whose husband is from Newry.

The painter says her catapult to 'mummy porn' fame is 'surreal'.

‘I’m really honoured that she put my work in the books. I have no Protestant or Catholic guilt where I’m like, “I can’t be part of an erotic book!”’ she said. ‘I’m just quite pleased that she liked it.’

Her work is mentioned in all three of the books. In the first, a mosaic is hanging in businessman Christian Grey’s office, creating the backdrop when he meets Anastasia Steele – who later becomes his sex slave.

The books says: 'Everything is white – ceiling, floors and walls – except for the wall by the door where a mosaic of small paintings hang.

'Thirty-six of them arranged in a square. A series of mundane, forgotten objects, painted in such precise detail they looked like photographs.'

Miss Trouton, from Portadown, said that the popular author was particularly struck by one of her works,  'Looking At the Overlooked', which comprises more than 300 smaller works on board depicting household objects.

She said: 'Erika saw them when she came to a viewing of mine in London in 2006. It was very large, 300 pictures – she scaled it back to 36 in the book – all of very mundane objects you might see around the house.'

The work, which is a metaphor for the mundane becoming extraordinary, is discussed by the two main characters in the book's opening chapter.

Miss Trouton added that the works also reflects the sordid relationship between the two characters: 'She is quite an ordinary girl, but Christian finds her extraordinary.'

It is referred to again at the end of the third book Fifty Shades Freed, when Christian recalls first meeting Anastasia.

And in the second book, Fifty Shades Darker, another of Trouton’s paintings is donated to a charity auction.

Influence: This painting, which includes depictions of teapots and mop buckets, has a starring role in the steamy novels

So was Miss Trouton, whose paintings fetch from £715 (€900) to £9,500 (€12,000), surprised by her friend's steamy imagination?

'Well, I have to say it is very funny when you know someone quite well and you think, “Oh my goodness, you’re into that!”’ she giggles.

'But she did most of her research online. She has a very happy, normal family and home life.'

The secretive painter kept her involvement in the books hidden from even family and friends.

Her Facebook page is full of witty comments, including one from her brother Stevie saying, 'I'm telling Dad!'

'For now I’m just happy for people to be seeing my work,' shrugs Jennifer. 'That’s what all artists want ultimately.'
