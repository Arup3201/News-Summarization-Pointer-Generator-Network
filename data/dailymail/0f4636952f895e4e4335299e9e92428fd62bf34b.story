Tottenham Hotspur forward Harry Kane has signed a new five-and-a-half-year contract to remain at White Hart Lane.

The England Under 21 forward has firmly established himself in the Spurs line-up this season under Mauricio Pochettino.

The deal sees the 21-year-old commit his future to the north London club until 2020 - on terms of £45,000 a week.

Age: 21 (D.O.B. 28.07.93)

Born: Walthamstow, England

Clubs: Tottenham Hotspur (2009-), Leyton Orient (2011), Millwall (2012), Norwich City (loan, 2012-13, Leicester City (loan, 2013) 

Career goals: 41

Goals this season: 20 (10 in Premier League) 

Kane has been in magnificent form this season, netting 20 goals in 33 appearances.

In 19 Premier League appearances, Kane has scored 10 times - including twice during Spurs' 3-0 win at West Bromwich Albion on Saturday.

Kane tweeted after signing the deal: 'Very happy to have signed my new contract at Spurs! Excited for the future ahead! Thank you for all your messages! #COYS.'

He also told the Spurs website: 'It's been a great six months. I've been really pleased with how things have gone. This (contract) is another stepping stone and hopefully now I'll push on again from this and get even better.

'All you can do as a footballer is try to get better and better and that's what I aim to do, to get better, score more goals and play better for the team,' he added. 'I'm really looking forward to the rest of the season.

'I'm only 21 and I've a lot of football ahead of me. I'll keep my feet on the ground and keep working hard for the team and for the club. I've been at Spurs since I was 11 and always loved the club. I've been here 10 years now and hopefully there are many more good times to come.'

Loan spells earlier in Kane's career at Leyton Orient, Millwall, Norwich City and Leicester City helped the forward hone his skills.

However, this season Kane has become a mainstay of Pochettino's side - leapfrogging the likes of Emmanuel Adebayor and Roberto Soldado in the pecking order.

In a statement released by Tottenham on their website, they said: 'The club is delighted to announce that Harry Kane has signed a new five-and-a-half-year contract which runs until 2020. 

'The young striker, still only 21, has been in outstanding form for us this season with 20 goals in all competitions, including a memorable double against Premier League leaders Chelsea at the Lane on New Year's Day.

'An academy graduate, Harry made his first-team debut against Hearts in the Europa League in August 2011 and made his big breakthrough last season when he scored on his first Premier League start for us against Sunderland in April - the first of three goals in consecutive league games.

'A Spurs fan born locally in Walthamstow, Harry has also impressed on international duty, having represented England at Under 17, 19 and 20 level, while his record for the Under 21 side currently stands at eight goals from 10 games.'
