Google has done a U-turn on its plans to crack down on pornography, after bloggers complained that they need to publish explicit photographs in order to ‘express their identities’.

Earlier this week the web search giant told people who publish explicit videos and images on its Blogger platform that it would hide their posts from public view if they didn’t clean up their act.

It gave them a month to delete any offensive posts, or face having their accounts made ‘private’ so that they could only be viewed through the author’s own account.

Google had previously announced changes to its Blogger platform banning graphic images from public view

The move was widely welcomed by campaigners who fear that pornography is too easily accessible on the internet, including by children.

However, the American company rowed back on its promise just three days later following a backlash from bloggers.

Many of the people who post explicit material said they needed to express themselves, and complained that Google would be erasing collections of explicit material that they had built up over the course of ten years.

Google responded that it would revert to its previous policy, which allows bloggers to publish offensive sexual images and videos as long as they are placed behind a page warning viewers that it is adult content.

But the American company rowed back on its promise just three days later following a backlash from bloggers

‘We’ve had a ton of feedback, in particular about the introduction of a retroactive change (some people have had accounts for 10+ years), but also about the negative impact on individuals who post sexually explicit content to express their identities,’ the company said.

‘So rather than implement this change, we’ve decided to step up enforcement around our existing policy prohibiting commercial porn.’

The web search giant will only ban content that is illegal, or has been published without the consent of the people it features.

It had never threatened to ban nude photographs that offered ‘substantial public benefit’ on artistic, educational or scientific grounds.

The company’s Blogger platform does not account for every blog on the internet. However, it includes accounts ending in ‘blogspot.com’, a free service with millions of users.
