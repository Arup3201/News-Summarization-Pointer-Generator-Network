Shortly after being appointed chairman of the Football Association last summer, Greg Dyke declared that one of his main targets was to see England win the World Cup in the desert heat of Qatar in 2022.

He said he was aware that such a target could create pressure on players but he was undeterred. ‘Top players must be able to  handle pressure if they want to be winners. We want to be winners,’ he boomed. The ensuing derision was deafening.

A few months on, at the draw for the World Cup finals, the cameras caught Dyke making a flamboyant cut-throat gesture as England’s opening match in Manaus was announced. There was an eruption of derision for his public display of despair.

Big idea: FA Chairman Greg Dyke reveals the idea for Premier League B Teams

On Thursday, as the centrepiece of his grandiose FA Commission, Dyke announced a plan to introduce Premier League B teams into the Football League by the year 2016-17.

The details of this dismantling of a 100-year-old ‘pyramid’ are still evolving but the clamorous derision it provoked was encapsulated in one sublime tweet from Accrington Stanley: ‘In 2016-17 we can achieve our dream… We’ll finally be able to play Stoke City Reserves in the Football League.’

Alan Pardew has a meeting this week with Mike Ashley. With his job on the line, the Newcastle manager will attempt to persuade the club owner that 50,000 Geordies can be wrong.

At such times, Pardew likes to quote a piece of cod philosophy. ‘Life is a rocky road,’ he says.

‘And when it gets rocky, you have to stay strong and focused.’

The voice of the great David Brent floats back down the years: ‘If you want the rainbow, you’ve got to put up with the rain. Do you know which “philosopher” said that? Dolly Parton. And people say she’s just a big pair of tits.’

I sense a pattern emerging here, and its thread is the personality of chairman Dyke. As his brilliant career in media and commerce would suggest, this is a man of enormous ability, with  bubbling self-confidence and a tumbling stream of ideas.

But, as his experience at the FA vividly demonstrates, those virtues are occasionally accompanied by a curiously naive desire to make an extravagant impact, to pose at the centre of events. The World Cup ‘target’ was the kind of thing which might have been spouted by a third-rate politician, while the ‘cut-throat’ affair smacked of simple showing-off.

But the latest episode is more complicated and a good deal more troubling. For the fact is that Dyke’s Commission have illuminated some long-standing problems and have come up with some thoughtful solutions.

The fact that only 32 per cent of players who started Premier League matches in the 2012-13 season were qualified to play for England is a disturbing statistic. In Spain, the starting figure for Spanish players was 59 per cent, while in Germany and Italy almost 50 per cent were qualified for the national teams. To cite such statistics is not to promote some crass, Ukipian fear of Johnny Foreigner; rather, it is to illustrate the scope of the problem which faces the England manager, Roy Hodgson.

Bad move: Dyke mimics cutting his throat after England's group for the World Cup is announced

Raise your game: Danny Mills claims lower league players will raise their game against reserve sides

Dyke’s Commission propose that the number of home-grown players required in a Premier League squad of 25 should be increased from eight to 13 and, in a smaller Football League squad, from six to 12.

They also demand drastic reform of  the flawed process by which clubs can sign players who do not hold a European Union passport and believe there should be a cap of two non-EU players in any Premier League squad. Both of which address the way in which a stream of low-priced mediocrities infiltrate the English game.

Come the autumn, there will be potentially valuable reports on our gross under-investment in coaching and the embarrassing neglect of grassroots facilities.

But such measures do not make a headline or lead a television news bulletin. They are not what Dyke sees as a Big Idea. And so we were treated to the B teams notion, a palpable nonsense which distorts a decent competition, demeans a host of small, proud clubs and offers little but worthless confusion to ambitious players parachuted in from the Premier League.

Danny Mills, once an agricultural full-back and now a member of Dyke’s Commission, attempted to sell the dubious fantasy to a still more dubious public. ‘I guarantee that every single player that plays against them (the cossetted tyros of the Premier League) will raise their game,’ he said. ‘There will be a pride, there will be an ego and it’ll be, “We do not want these  little upstarts with loads of money to come and beat us”.’

What a pretty picture that paints and 
what an appealing prospect it opens up! Fear and loathing in League 
Three; who could resist it? It was the same Mills, incidentally, who 
reflected: ‘If England were to win the World Cup, it would be the 
exception rather than the rule.’ Small wonder that Dyke was so anxious 
to have the sage on board.

Man with a plan: Dyke and his report has attracted plenty of publicity

Opposition to the proposal is growing by the day, beginning with the Premier and Football Leagues and continuing through the Conference and the unconsulted masses of football fans.

There must be a real chance that the entire project will be swept away in the storm of protest and derision. Given the work which has gone into the saner parts of the scheme, that would be a great shame.

Yet if it should happen, then Dyke will have only himself to blame. As a reforming chairman of the FA, he has much to offer the national game. But as a frustrated song and dance man, courting the spotlight and remorselessly seeking the next Big Idea, he is betraying a rare and valuable talent.

Hodgson can only go with what he’s got

After his remarkable playing career, the late Alan Ball found football management rather more difficult. He toiled at the trade but the bad days outnumbered the good.

On one such day, as he sat cursing in the dugout, he decided to make a substitution.

‘Who would you like to bring on, boss?’, asked his assistant. Ball smiled. ‘Well, Bobby Charlton, Geoff Hurst and Bobby Moore for starters,’ he said. ‘But I reckon I’ll have to make do with what I’ve got’.

Decision time: Roy Hodgson names his squad for the World Cup this week

Roy Hodgson will recognise the feeling. When he announces his World Cup squad on Monday, Hodgson will strike an optimistic tone. Yet he will surely experience pangs of apprehension.

Essentially, his chosen 23 selects itself because there are few alternatives to whom he can  turn. For what it’s worth, my own version would be:

Goalkeepers: Hart (Man City), Foster (WBA), Forster (Celtic).

Defenders: Johnson (Liverpool), Cahill (Chelsea), Jagielka (Everton), Caulker (Cardiff),  Jones (Man Utd), Baines (Everton), Cole (Chelsea), Shaw (Southampton).

Midfielders: Gerrard (Liverpool), Lallana (Southampton), Sterling (Liverpool), Wilshere (Arsenal), Oxlade-Chamberlain (Arsenal), Milner (Man City), Henderson (Liverpool), Barkley (Everton).

Strikers: Rooney (Man Utd), Welbeck (Man Utd), Sturridge (Liverpool), Lambert (Southampton).

No go: Andy Carroll looks unlikely to be included in the World Cup squad

Young star: Southampton's Luke Shaw is a possible contender for the England squad

Astonishingly, there has been some support for Andy Carroll, the primitive striker who has scored twice in 14 appearances for West Ham this season.

Equally bizarre is the campaign to include the 35-year-old Frank Lampard, on the grounds that he is an affable fellow who will spread good cheer. If England really need to accommodate an amiable midfielder whose best days are far behind him, then Sir Trevor Brooking must be in with a shout.

Far better, I suggest, to risk overloading the quota of full-backs and offer the experience to Luke Shaw, whose professional future seems thrillingly predictable.

So there it is; scarcely a collection to terrify Argentina, Germany, Spain or Belgium, far less Brazil. But, in the absence of a Charlton, Hurst or Moore, then Roy Hodgson must make do with  what he’s got.
