A wild monkey that gained notoriety for wandering around Tampa Bay, Florida for two years - before attacking a 60-year-old woman earlier this month - has finally been captured.

Wildlife officials caught the  rhesus macaque on Wednesday on a low tree branch following a five-hour stakeout in south St Petersburg.

'We concealed ourselves in the area,' Baryl Martin, spokesperson for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, told CBS. 'And we waited for the monkey to approach.'

Caught! The Mystery Monkey of Tampa Bay has been captured after more than two years on the run

Plan: Wildlife officials staged a five-hour stake out before they caught the monkey in a tree branch

The monkey was shot with a tranquilizer dart and officials waited for its effects to set in - but the monkey ran off, leading to a chase for 50 to 100 yards.

After the dash through a wooded area, wildlife trapper Vernon Yates grabbed it with his hand and a pole, and Martin said he then 'settled down quite a bit'.

He was then taken to a veterinarian's office to be evaluated. Staff will check him for contagious diseases and microchips, which would lead them to a previous owner.

Officials will hold him for 30 days to ensure no one claims him before trying to find him a new home.

Checks: He will now be tested for diseases and authorities will try to find him a new home if he is not claimed

The capture was much simpler than initial plans to lure the monkey with companionship and food, first by using a female monkey and then Doc, a one-year-old male sitting inside a trap with fruit.

Another plan that authorities had 
tried was enticing him with bananas - but he always nabbed the fruit and
ran off before he could be caught.

That effort came two weeks ago after a woman was attacked by the animal as she sat on her porch.

The animal jumped on the woman and began scratching
and biting her, proving theories put forward by experts that its 
interaction with humans would eventually lead to dangerous behaviour.

Hearing her mother's screams from 
inside, the woman's daughter rushed outside to her aide, grabbing the 
monkey by its legs and flinging it across the garden before it scampered
away.

Fears: The capture comes two weeks after the monkey jumped on a local woman and attacked her

Neighbour: The rhesus macaque has lived in the St Petersburg, Florida area since 2010 and though wildlife officials have warned that it would become a hazard if fed

'She could hear the clicking of teeth,' her daughter told the Tampa Bay Times. 'It's been very traumatizing for her.'

The
woman was treated for puncture wounds and both she and her daughter are
said to be fine after having been given shots to prevent them from 
contracting infections.

The
incident has ignited fear among members of the south St Petersburg 
community who are well acquainted with the animal and have come to refer
to it as the Mystery Monkey of Tampa Bay.

It
is thought to have been separated from a colony in Silver Springs and 
has been living alone in gardens belonging to Pinellas county residents 
since 2010.

The daughter of the 60-year-old woman
who was bitten said that it had visited their garden nearly every 
morning for the past year and a half.

Very serious: Steven Colbert shot a segement on the Colbert Report about the monkey in 2010 and made fun of the way it had managed to elude authorities with its resistance to tranquilisers

Long way from home: The rhesus macaque is thought to have been separated from a colony in Silver Springs before it ended up in Pinellas County and more specifically St Petersburg

She said in a statement: 'The monkey is not afraid of people. So don't got outside very often. I don't trust the monkey.'

So
famous was the 40lb macaque, that it has its own Facebook page and 
comedian Steven Colbert even filmed a segment about it in 2010.

Chuckling
overt the monkey's ability to escape capture by wildlife experts, Mr 
Colbert showed a clip from an interview in which animal rescue 
professional, Vernon Yates told reporters: 'I've personally shot drugs 
into this animal a dozen times and for whatever reason it doesn't seem 
to affect him.'

In August, a sincere Mr Yates even 
appeared in a Bloomberg special speculating on whether the monkey may 
show his face at the RNC in Tampa and explaining that, thanks to his 
agility and speed, he could be anywhere at any time and hard to catch.
