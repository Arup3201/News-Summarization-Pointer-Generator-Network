She has shot to international fame thanks to her dedication to her new royal role, but Queen Letizia is still a down-to-earth girl at heart.

The Queen of Spain, who worked as a news anchor before marring King Felipe, posed for a selfie with two girls during a trip to the cinema on Friday.

She and King Felipe enjoyed a low-key date night in Madrid at the cinema, where they watched Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.

But first....let me take a selfie: Queen Letizia posed for a selfie with two female cinema goers during a low-key date night with her husband, King Felipe, on Friday

Queen Letizia, who looked casual but nonetheless glamorous, wore a lime green T-shirt and her hair loose - she even put her arm around one of the girls in the now viral shot.

The two girls in the picture described Letizia as 'very friendly', telling Europa Press she chatted to them for a while before agreeing to the snap.

Belen Guzman, one of the girls in the picture, said: 'They are a great King and Queen but they are even better people.'

Since the cinema outing on Friday, the King and Queen of Spain have been extremely busy.

Yesterday they took a day trip to France to attend a meeting with President Francois Hollande.

So chic! Queen Letizia of Spain looks elegant in an off-white cutaway dress on an official visit to meet French President Francois Hollande

Letizia pulled out all the stops to make sure she impressed in a country famous for its fashion.

The
 Spanish royal, who has gained notoriety for her savvy sense of style, 
looked glossy and glamorous in an off-white dress as she joined her 
husband to visit President Francois Hollande.

The 41-year-old and King Felipe greeted the French President on the 
steps of the Elysee Palace in Paris; it marked the Spanish royal 
couple's first official visit to France.

Queen Letizia looked confident as she strode into the Elysee Palace in the fitted summer dress, which had a nude ribbon belt tied around her waist and intricate floral designs on the hem.

The tight dress served to accentuate the mother-of-two's tiny frame, and proving that she takes every aspect of her outfit into consideration she accessorised with a nude clutch and matching earrings.

 teenagers to other Spanish speaking countries to expand their 
education.

And as well as showcasing her style credentials at several royal events this week the new 
Queen, already a hit with the Spanish people, has set social media on 
fire.

Showing a playful and down-to-earth side, the Queen posed for a selfie with two female teenage fans on Friday evening.

Looking
 relaxed and dressed down in a yellow T-Shirt, Letizia grinned at the 
camera in the shot, which has exploded on Twitter in Spain.

Last
 week she also attended a summer party for the international school of 
music of Principe de Asturias Foundation in Oviedo where she listen to 
young musicians play a variety of instruments.
