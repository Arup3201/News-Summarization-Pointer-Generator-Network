Some 4.5million E.On customers will get £24 off their bills this year after the energy giant decided to pass on the money it has saved from the falling price of gas on the wholesale markets

Energy consumers are finally set to get some relief from ever-higher bills after one of the Big Six fuel companies announced it was cutting its gas tariff by 3.5 per cent.

Some 4.5million E.On customers will get £24 off their bills this year after the energy giant decided to pass on the money it has saved from the falling price of gas on the wholesale markets.

The move could spark a price war among the leading power suppliers - but experts have warned that the cuts are 'trivial' and encouraged customers to shop around for the best deal.

The latest figures suggest that even though wholesale gas prices have reached a four-year low - and are a fifth lower than they were last winter - most households have seen no respite in their heating and electricity costs.

Ed Miliband's planned freeze in energy prices has been cited by company bosses as one cause of the persistently high prices, because firms fear being locked in to low tariffs if Labour comes to power after May's election.

But now E.On has cut prices, the pressure is on the other Big Six suppliers – British Gas, SSE, Scottish Power, EDF and Npower – to follow suit.

The energy industry has come under fire over the past year due to its high profits, and faces a probe by the Competition and Markets Authority to determine whether it is in fact operating a competitive market.

The fall in the price of wholesale gas is partly due to the fracking revolution in the US, and the discovery of shale gas in the UK and continental Europe.

Energy firms' refusal to cut bills stands in contrast to the situation for motorists, who have seen the cost of petrol fall at the pumps in tandem with the tumbling price of oil in global markets.

Labour wants to give Ofgem the ability to force companies to pass on wholesale price cuts to consumers - which industry estimates claim could knock £136 off the average bill.

E.On UK chief executive Tony Cocker said Mr Miliband's proposed price freeze meant the company was 'undoubtedly taking a risk' by cutting tariffs.

However he added the price cut and new, lower tariff demonstrate that E.On 'fundamentally believe in doing the right thing for our customers'.

Mr Cocker added that although oil prices have slumped, the gas price remains volatile, while other non-energy costs on customer bills have increased and are set to rise even further.

A spokesman for energy regulator Ofgem said: 'This is a small step in the right direction. We have consistently called for suppliers to explain the growing gap between falling wholesale prices and retail prices. 

'Cutting prices is an explanation that consumers will understand and in a competitive market we would expect others to follow suit.' 

Energy Secretary Ed Davey added: 'This will be very welcome news for many bill payers. Those who aren't seeing price cuts should check whether someone else can give them a better deal - many people have saved hundreds of pounds by switching supplier, which is now quicker and easier than ever before.' 

However, Martin Lewis of MoneySavingExpert.com insisted that the only way for customers to get a fair deal was by shopping around and changing supplier.

'All price cuts are welcome, even if they’re just a trivial 3.5 per cent on gas only,' he said. 'Yet the true revelation of this announcement is that it shines a light on the fact that most households in the UK are massively overpaying for their energy. 

'The real concern is that people will see this as a message that "everything’s fine, my provider has cut prices, things are going to get better" - no, this is wrong, only switchers get the cheapest prices. So do a comparison and see how much you are overpaying.

'While it is possible other companies will follow suit and shave down their standard prices slightly, I doubt we’ll see any real change until after the general election.

'Most providers are petrified of the potential Labour government's price freeze, which means if they cut now they’re likely locked in, even if wholesale prices rise again - so they’re gaming the system. If only Ed Miliband hadn’t pre-announced it, it would’ve been a strong policy.'

Price cut: E.On customers will have the equivalent of £24 cut off their annual gas bill

Households have seen their energy bills rise by a third since 2010 yet figures show wholesale costs to be at a four-year low, consumer groups claim.

The latest figures from Ofgem show that wholesale gas prices are down 19 per cent on last winter.

But the drop is likely to surprise householders who have only seen harsh increases in their energy bills - while consumer groups and the government urge them to try and find a cheaper deal by switching between suppliers.

The consumer website energyhelpline.com estimates that £136 could be knocked off the average bill if falls in the price of wholesale oil and gas were passed on to consumers.

Industry regulator Ofgem wrote to the Big Six firms in the summer, asking them to explain how they were going to pass on falling wholesale costs to their customers.

At the time, Rachel Fletcher, senior partner for the regulator's markets division, said its figures 'might be suggesting that there is room for price cuts or that you wouldn't be expecting prices to go up.

'As the regulator, it is not for us to tell companies how to set their prices. We are relying on the market to do that.

'But the thing that has concerned us is that in a situation where we have got wholesale costs coming down, you would be expecting some of the companies at the very least to be saying "Here is an opportunity to gain market share by reducing our prices." We haven't seen that.'

Wholesale gas prices tend to move alongside oil prices, and Chancellor George Osborne has launched a Treasury investigation into whether energy companies are passing on the savings from falls in the wholesale price of oil.

Energy expert at MoneySupermarket Stephen Murray said that while the cut is welcome, it is 'underwhelming'.

He added: 'It's been three long years since customers last benefitted from price decreases to standard energy bills.

'To say it has been a long time coming would be the understatement of the year, but finally one of the nation's Big Six suppliers has responded to the falling price of wholesale gas and given bills the chop.'

Other members of the Big Six refused to reveal whether or not they were planning to follow E.on's lead and cut prices for their customers.

British Gas, Npower, EDF and Scottish Power all said they were constantly reviewing their tariffs, while a spokesman for SSE said: 'When we announced our unprecedented price freeze to 2016 we said we'd cut prices if we can.' 

Figures from Energy UK reveal that 1.3million customers moved from a large supplier to a small one during the past 12 months.

This has forced the hands of the Big Six, which have all recently launched new tariffs in response to cut-price deals from smaller rivals - but these new independent suppliers still tend to offer the cheapest deals.

Potential savings for households are now huge - some can shave off more than £400 a year from their bills - particularly for those that have never switched before.

Last January E.On became the last of the Big Six firms to raise gas prices, by 3.7 per cent or £20 a year.

However, year-forward wholesale gas prices have fallen 28 per cent over the last 12 months, according to consumer body energyhelpline.com.

Its marketing director, Mark Todd, said E.On's move was a 'small step in the right direction'.

He added: 'British Gas in particular should be able to follow quickly and with bigger cuts. They have the highest standard gas prices and benefit the most from wholesale gas price drops.

'Now is the time for suppliers to take action. Winter is here and this is when customers most need a price cut but suppliers with an eye to profit least want to give one. The reaction of the other suppliers will show their priorities - customers or profit.'

Industry regulator Ofgem wrote to the Big Six firms in the summer, asking them to explain how they were going to pass on falling wholesale costs to their customers. It also referred the industry to the Competition and Markets Authority.

In July the CMA launched a wide-ranging investigation into the UK's energy market which will look at rising energy bills, service quality, profitability and uncertainty over future investment.
