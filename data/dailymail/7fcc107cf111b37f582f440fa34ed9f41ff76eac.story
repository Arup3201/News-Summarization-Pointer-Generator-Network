A Washington State University professor repeatedly raped a 16-year-old female relative during an 18-month affair, police say. 

Andrew Appleton was arrested after the girl, now aged 18, came forward and said he had sexually assaulted her when she was 16 and 17.

The 51-year-old politics, philosophy and public affairs professor 'intimidated and coerced her' into the sexual relationship, which became a 'way of life', kxly.com reported.

'I fell in love with you,' he told the teen during a police-tapped phone call as they arranged to meet in Moscow's East City Park.

'You were there for me when my wife wasn't.'

Appleton's wife divorced him after she found out about the long-standing abuse, khq.com reported, urging the victim to report it to police.

The alleged abuse took place in several locations including Moscow and Sandpoint, Idaho, California and Texas, between February 2010 and September 2011.
