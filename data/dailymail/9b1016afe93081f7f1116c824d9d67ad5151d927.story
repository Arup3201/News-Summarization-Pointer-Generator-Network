One of Eric Garner's daughters has outraged New York police officers by sharing the address of another cop who was at the scene of her father's chokehold death this summer.

At 1.45am on Thursday, Erica Garner tweeted  that cop Justin D'Amico, who has previously been named in reports, was 'another officer that helped killed my dad', the New York Post reported.

She also shared a link that listed addresses for the officer and five possible relatives.

Ms Garner, who has more than 5,000 followers on Twitter, promptly deleted the tweet after inquiries from the Post, it reported.

Thoughtless: Erica Garner, whose father died at the hands of a police officer in July, tweeted the name of a second officer at the scene and shared addresses for him and five of his potential relatives

Her message came nearly a week after two police officers, Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, were shot dead in their patrol car in Brooklyn by Ismaaiyl Brinsley, who had claimed he was going to put 'wings on pigs' for the deaths of Garner and Ferguson teenager Michael Brown.

Police officers said they feared that D'Amico and his family could now be targeted because of the 'disgusting' tweet.

'She clearly wants someone to go to the officer's house and assassinate him in cold blood just like Ramos and Liu,' a police source told the Post.

After the attack on Saturday, police reported threats of copycat attacks across the city.

On Wednesday, Elvin Payamps of Queens was taken into custody after he allegedly told a friend that he wished the two cops had been white. Police allegedly found a cache of weapons at his home.

Ms Garner's family attorney did not deny that Erica Garner had shared the link to pastebin.com, which allows users to anonymously share text documents, but claimed she had not known what was in the link. 

'Nobody in the Garner family, including Erica, would consciously send information out about the personal address or phone number or any identifying information about the police officers, particularly after what happened to those two officers,' Jonathan Moore said. 

D'Amico was given immunity to testify before the Staten Island grand jury that ultimately decided not to bring charges against another police officer, Daniel Pantaleo, who held Garner, 43, in a chokehold during his arrest on July 17.

The NYPD banned the use of chokeholds in 1992.

In the horrific incident, which was caught on camera by a passerby, Garner told the officers that he could not breathe, lost consciousness and later died.

Loss: Her Twitter post came nearly a week after police officers Rafael Ramos, left, and Wenjian Liu, right, were shot dead in Brooklyn by a man claiming he was avenging the deaths of Garner and Michael Brown

Officers claimed he resisted arrest after he was caught illegally selling untaxed cigarettes. 

The grand jury's failure to indict Pantaleo sparked protests across the city, where demonstrations were already underway following another grand jury's decision not to indict the Ferguson officer who killed Brown in August.

After Garner's death, Pantaleo was placed on modified leave and stripped of his gun and badge while D'Amico was assigned to desk duty.
