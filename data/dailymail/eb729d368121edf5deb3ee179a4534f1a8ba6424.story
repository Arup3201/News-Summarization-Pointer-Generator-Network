A New York City school teacher who set his heart on living in Manhattan has found a way to maximize the space inside his tiny studio apartment by thinking inside the box – and the finished result is now up for sale.

In 2005, Eric Schneider, a third-grade teacher at Grace Church School, bought a 450-square-foot unit with a tiny kitchen on the Upper West Side for $235,000.

‘It was basically an open rectangular space,’ Schneider recalled in an interview with the site Fair Companies. ‘There wasn't much to it, there was just a couple of old closets, an old corner kitchen and that was it.’

Downsized: New York City teacher Eric Schneider bought a micro-apartment on the Upper West Side in 2005 for $235,000

Magic cabinet: The homeowner turned to a pair of architects, who came up with an all-in-one blue cabinet to maximize the limited space

Bare necessities: The large blue box contains a full-size Murphy bed hidden behind a cabinet door

Convenient: A cubbyhole tucked away behind the bed doubles as a nightstand, complete with a reading lamp

But Schneider enjoyed entertaining, and his cramped quarters were ill-suited for having people over.

That is when he turned to the team of architects Michael Chen and Kari Anderson, of Normal Projects, commissioning them to come up with a creative solution that would maximize his very limited space.

‘Initially
 we were looking at different ways we could subdivide the spaces into 
smaller spaces,’ said Chen, ‘but pretty quickly it became clear that 
there wasn't really enough room to get like a real bedroom in here and 
if you did then there wasn't really room to have a real living room 
area.’

Chen
 and Anderson came up with a 4-in-1 box that would serve as a bedroom, a
 living room, an office and a closet throughout the day. The unit and its many uses have been captured by photographer Alan Tansey.

The
 cabinet featuring chemistry-lab countertops, Plexiglas panels and 
medium-density fiberboard took a year to complete and cost Schneider 
$70,000.

Transformer: The space can be simultaneous a home office and a bedroom hidden behind a strategically placed panel providing privacy

All in one: This diagram of the Manhattan studio's floor plan shows all the uses of the cabinet

Party down: The box can been completely closed, with a small panel on the side used as a bar when the homeowner has people over

Gourmet kitchen: The miniscule apartment features an under-the-counter fridge and a half-width gas range

No inch wasted: The island separating the living room/bedroom/office from the kitchen doubles as a dining table comfortably sitting three

Schneider said he embraced the idea of downsizing and living a simpler, more stripped-down life. 

‘I get overwhelmed by too much [stuff],’ he said with a chuckle. 

On the outside, the large blue structure the architects had erected in the middle of Eric Schneider’s micro-apartment appears bulky and unwieldy, but looks can be deceiving.

The ‘magic cabinet’ contains a full-size Murphy bed, complete with a nightstand and lighting hidden behind a cabinet door, which then serves as a wall separating the sleeping quarters from the rest of the house.

By pulling out a few inexpensive panels, Schneider can turn his bedroom into a work space with a small library, a relatively private guest room, or a living room.

If the homeowner wants to entertain, the box can be closed up completely, with only a small flip-down panel on the side used as a bar.

Moving on up: The unfolding apartment is now on the market for listing price of $469,000

The team of architects dubbed their multipurpose cabinet 'the unfolding apartment,’ but Schneider, who spent a year living in Japan, lovingly refers to it as the ‘origami apartment.’

After a decade folding and unfolding the versatile box, Eric Schneider put his unit on the market this month for $469,000, the real estate site Curbed reported.

Beside the central structure, the unit boasts a small kitchen with a half-width Viking gas range and a compact below-the-counter refrigerator.
