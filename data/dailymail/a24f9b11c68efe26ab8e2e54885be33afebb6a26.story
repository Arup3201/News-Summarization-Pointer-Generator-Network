It's one of the the sexiest nights on television and its stunning models and superstar singing acts draw in millions of viewers every year.

But what really goes on behind the scenes of the iconic annual Victoria's Secret show?

Two of the lingerie giant's most famous Angels have revealed that the show, which saw the likes of Rihanna and Justin Bieber perform this year, is 'pure madness'.

Speaking to Vogue.co.uk, Erin Heatherton said it's all: 'Big personalities, big hair.

'It's a lot of fun - I think there's something special and timeless about girls getting ready together. This is the ultimate display - head-to-toe.'

Behati Prinsloo added: 'It's a girls club! It's kind of manic back there, but also fun and exciting.'

The lavish event, which has seen the likes of Miranda Kerr, Cara Delevingne and Jourdan Dunn strut down the catwalk in elaborately embellished lingerie, attracts hundreds of celebrities and entertainers and each year has a different theme.

The models don giant angel and butterfly wings, as well as peacock and ostrich feathers, which have all become emblematic of the Victoria's Secret lingerie brand.

Behati Prinsloo, 24, was discovered by Sarah Doukas of Storm models - who also spotted Cara Delevingne and Kate Moss - and was signed as the face of Pink, the brand's younger line, in 2008.

She has since walked for numerous high-end designers and just announced her engagement to Maroon 5 singer Adam Levine.

Erin Heatherton, 24, who is currently the face of the XOXO Spring/Summer 2013 line, says her favourite thing about Victoria's Secret is 'having the opportunity to play with my femininity'.

'It's a kind of creativity I never tapped into growing up.

'I love to learn and Victoria's 
Secret has given me more opportunities than I ever thought possible. I 
like doing things that scare me - I've learned never to doubt myself.'

And it seems that being a part of the brand is literally paying off: five out of the top 10 highest-earning models for 2012 were long-serving Angels, according to Forbes.

Erin Heatherton says she loves being an Angel because it gives her the opportunity to tap into her feminine side
