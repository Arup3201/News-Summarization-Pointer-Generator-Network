A woman who plummeted 150 feet off a seaside California cliff only to land upside down at the start of what became a 72-hour battle to survive has now shared the tale of how she made it out alive.

Debbie Lopez, 57, says at first she didn't realize her truck had landed on its roof February 7 after she skidded off the road while putting out a cigarette. 

When the full breadth of her dire situation sunk in, it took the Atascadero woman an unbelievable 24 hours just to get out of car.

Miracle: Debbie Lopez, 57, is seen here as she recovered in a California hospital following 72 hours she spent first escaping from her vehicle then climbing up a cliff face after her truck plummeted 150 feet when she missed a curve in a road along the Pacific Coast on February 7 

'The truck just flew over, and I could just feel myself flying down and hitting things I don't know what I hit, and when I landed, I didn't know I was upside down,' she told KSBY. 

With no drinking water in her truck, Lopez says she survived on water that collected from a storm in the vehicle's wheel well.

But even after she managed to escape the truck with serious bruises and injured ribs, the 150-foot cliff face rose menacingly before her.

'I just kept looking for different outlets and you know striking out, striking out,' Lopez told KEYT of the beginning of her ascent.

But, she says thoughts of faith and family kept pushing on. 'I knew at that point that I had to get myself out, I had to see my husband and my family.'

Lopez told the San Luis Obispo Tribune that she prayed the rosary over a dozen times for each of the two days she spent clawing her way up the cliff overlooking the Pacific.

'It was the adrenaline of just knowing I could not get back down if I stopped,' Lopez said, 'I just kept going forward and forward, little by little.'

For 48 hours, she made her way up. Finally, on Tuesday, she was at the road. She bent down and kissed the pavement.

Lopez managed to flag down a passing family visiting from Louisiana who called for help. 

She was released from the hospital Thursday.

'I just have a new lease on life, and there is a God and he listens,' she told KSBY.

Lopez's husband reported her missing when she failed to come home following a trip to the store February 7
