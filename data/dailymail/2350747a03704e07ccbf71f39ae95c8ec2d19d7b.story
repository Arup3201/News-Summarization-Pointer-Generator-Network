Microsoft has released their yearly rankings of the top UK search queries on Bing and the baby- faced singer has beaten off stiff competition from the likes of Beyonce and the Duchess of Cambridge to take the crown.

Justin Bieber fans have come together through social media to demand a UK screening of his new film, Believe, which lands in the US on Christmas day.

Now, following over 5,000 tweets and 2,000 emails, Vue Entertainment has struck a deal with the creators to screen it exclusively from boxing day, for one week only. T

Following the US film release announcement and with no planned UK screenings, Bieber fans up and down the country harnessed the power of social media, to voice their demand to see the feature-length documentary on the big screen. 

The Canadian pop musician, actor and singer-songwriter, has over 40 million followers on Twitter and was named by Forbes magazine in 2012, as the third-most powerful celebrity in the world. His new documentary film Believe will provide his fans, otherwise known as Beliebers, with a backstage and on-stage look at his rise to super stardom.  

Tim Richards, CEO, Vue Entertainment said: 'We were overwhelmed with the sheer number of Justin Bieber fans up and down the country wanting to see the film, and so we are thrilled to be able to satisfy the demand as the only cinema in the country to show Believe. It also goes to show how powerful social media can really be not to mention, the power of the ‘Beliebers’!
