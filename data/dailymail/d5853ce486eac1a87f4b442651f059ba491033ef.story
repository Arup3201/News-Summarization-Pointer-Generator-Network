Amazon has introduced two new Fire tablets and a Kindle with built in light so owners can finally read in the dark.

Boss Jeff Bezos unveiled the devices at an event in Santa Monica, claiming the firm 'loved to pioneer'.

The retail giant has set its sight firmly on Apple with the the Fire tablets.

One has a 7inch screen, the same as the much rumoured iPad mini, while a new Fire HD has an 8.9inch screen.

The costliest, 4G-ready version will go for $499 in the US, while a Wi-Fi version is £159 ($299) in both the UK and US.

The Kindle Fire HD, an 8.9inch screen tablet Amazon hopes will take on the iPad

The cheapest, 7-inch version of the Fire, which launched in November and
is now the No. 2-selling tablet in the United States, behind Apple's 
iPad, will sell for $159.

However, the firm did not say if the tablets we be made available internationally.

Bezos on Thursday stressed that Amazon saw the Kindle family of 
e-readers and tablets as a service, with hardware a critical element of 
its digital content business.

Amazon is competing with Apple, Google Inc and other technology 
companies for a foothold in the booming mobile-device market, because 
these devices are fast becoming the preferred tool to access consumer 
media over the Internet.

As the world's largest Internet retailer, it is
essential for Amazon to have a major presence in this new sector.

Amazon is willing to make little or no money selling cheap tablets and 
e-readers because it wants to get the devices into as many hands as 
possible, then sell higher-margin digital content, such as e-books, 
video, games, apps and music, to a more connected and engaged customer 
base.

However, it is believed the gadgets will show users adverts every time they are used.

The company also showed off a "paperwhite" e-reader with a much sharper screen and longer battery life.

Boss Jeff Bezos said 'We love to invent, we love to pioneer.

'We even love going down alleys that turnout to be blind alleys - but every once in a while those alleys turn into broad avenues.'

The firm first revealed the Kindle paperwhite, which has a new lighted screen.

Bezos told the crowd the display they wanted didn’t exist, so they spent four years developing it.

'People are going to love the light so much they’ll leave it on all the time,' he said.

The firm also revealed a new Kindle Fire HD tablet, which features a 8.9-inch 1920x1200, 254ppi display.

It has a laminated touch sensor for better visuals and 25% less glare.

The tablet is powered by an OMAP 4470 processor from Texas Instruments, which Amazon says outperforms the Tegra 3.

The Kindle Fire HD also includes stereo speakers, an upgrade over the Kindle Fire's mono speaker.

It also has an 'x-ray' feature which lets people find out an actor's name simply by tapping on them on screen, and multiple user accounts so children can easily use it without ruining their parent's setting.

The Fire will be an effort to take a larger share of a tablet computer market dominated by Apple's iPad.

It could help Amazon boost sales of digital goods such as e-books and movies.

The event came a day after Nokia Corp. and Google Inc.'s Motorola Mobility division announced five new smartphones between them.

The two from Nokia will be the company's first to run the next version of Windows.

Consumer electronics makers are trying to generate interest in their products now, before Apple announces a new iPhone and possibly a mini iPad next week.

'Kindle Fire HD is the world’s most-advanced 7” tablet, with a stunning customised HD display, the fastest Wi-Fi, exclusive Dolby audio, powerful processor and graphics engine, 11 hours of battery life, and 16 GB of storage for all your HD content,' said Bezos

'Not only does Kindle Fire HD feature the most advanced hardware, it’s also a service.

'When combined with our enormous content ecosystem, unmatched cross-platform interoperability, and standard-setting customer service, we hope people will agree that Kindle Fire HD is the best 7” tablet available anywhere, at any price.
