James McCarthy is almost certainly out of the Merseyside derby after suffering another setback that will extend his injury misery.

The Everton midfielder, who has not played since December 28, aggravated his hamstring during a training session and could be facing another two weeks on the sidelines, which would mean him missing the game with Liverpool and the trip to Chelsea next Wednesday.

It is a huge blow for manager Roberto Martinez, who had been hoping to relaunch McCarthy's season at Crystal Palace last weekend, and the 24-year-old, who has now suffered four hamstring problems since the end of November.

McCarthy, who had been Everton's Player of the Season, was first injured during the Europa League win against Wolfsburg on November 27 and missed the subsequent six matches.

He came back for the Christmas matches against Stoke City and Newcastle United but failed to see out either of those 90 minutes.

McCarthy stepped up his rehabilitation programme when Everton's squad went to Qatar for a warm weather training break but he has subsequently not figured in any of the Toffees' last six matches.
