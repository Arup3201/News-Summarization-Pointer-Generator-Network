The 32 rare photographs up for auction depict the Hollywood icon's career from start to finish

The collection includes an original photo issued by Fox Studios showing her in sultry pose, wearing a sling back dress

Other candid snaps show the blonde beauty at different stages of her life right up until one of the last ever photos taken of her in July 1962.

The black and white image was captured just weeks before she was found dead aged 36 at her LA home following a barbiturate overdose on August 5, 1962.

Taken by celebrity snapper George Barris the poignant snap shows Marilyn in a cream jumper lying on a beach, resting her chin on her hands and staring into the camera.

The set also includes a chilling picture Monroe had commissioned herself of her pretending to be dead - just a few months before she passed away.

Others include an original photo issued by Fox Studios showing her in sultry pose, wearing a sling back dress.

It was this image which inspired artist Andy Warhol as the basis for his now world famous screen print images of her.

Some of the pictures of the iconic star will never have been seen by the general public before

Many of the pictures show Marilyn as the care-free sex symbol she was most well known as 

Each individual image could fetch up to £2,500 each when they are auctioned

The pictures go back to the start of her career when she looked markedly different with brunette hair 

Marilyn, really called Norma Jeane Mortenson, totally transformed her image over the course of her career 

Despite her carefree public image, Marilyn's life was marked by unhappiness and heartbreak 

The collection of original prints are being sold by professional snooker player Dominic Dale, who has collected Monroe memorabilia for the past 25 years.

Each individual image could fetch up to £2,500 each when they are auctioned by Mullocks Auctioneers at Ludlow Racecourse, Shrops., in two weeks time..

Richard Westwood-Brookes, historical document expert at the auctioneers, said: 'These are classic images of Marilyn and are works of high art in their own right.

Marilyn's 'ditsy blonde' persona, which many of her roles revolved around, hid a woman of real intelligence 

'What's important about these photos is that they all have their photographer's stamp on the back, so they have come straight from the negative of the image

'As a result we are pricing them at £500 estimate each.

'But judging from the worldwide interest in original photographs such as these of Marilyn we expect that they will make far more.

'We have seen similar images to these changing hands in recent times for five times that figure.

Not many of the photos in the mammoth collection are in colour, which will surely raise their value 

The star is considered by many, even over fifty years after her death, to be one of the most beautiful women ever 

The collection also boasts an original signature of Marilyn surmounted by a rare black and white photograph taken by the celebrated American photographer Andre De Dienes on Tobey Beach in May 1949

The set also includes snaps by several other renowned photographers including Joseph Jasgur, who signed this snap 

'This is a chance to own one of the largest private collections of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia in the world.

'It really is a really unique opportunity to get your hands on some rare photos of one of the most iconic Hollywood stars that ever lived.'

The collection also boasts an original signature of Marilyn surmounted by a rare black and white photograph taken by the celebrated American photographer Andre De Dienes on Tobey Beach in May 1949.

Marilyn was on a promotional tour for the film titled 'Love Happy', a Marx Brothers movie, when she met up with the Mr De Dienes who first photographed her in 1945 as the young Norma Jeane Dougherty, a 19-year-old model with the Blue Book Modelling Agency.

The set also includes snaps by several other renowned photographers including Joseph Jasgur, Bruno Bernard, Philippe Halsman and Milton H Greene.

The intense interest sparked by the collection becoming available shows our obsession with Marilyn is as strong as ever 

Mr Westwood-Brookes added: 'In addition to the photographs, Dominic's collection also has some very important books including an extremely rare edition of 'Marilyn - a Hollywood Farewell' by Leigh Wiener with preface by Richard B Stolley.

'This was produced in 1990 as a limited edition signed by Wiener and Stolley.

'Unfortunately Wiener died before he could complete more than a few signings, and the copy we are offering is one of those very few which bear both signatures, together with an autograph dedication from Stolley to Dominic Dale.

'The collection also contains the definitive books produced by the photographers, which include printed versions of the originals we are offering in the sale, and many other rare and desirable books about Marilyn.'

Snooker ace Dominic, 42, added: 'It will be sad to see them go but my snooker commitments now call for me to be jetting around the world all the time.

'I think the time has come for my collection to pass into the hands of other lovers of Marilyn who will cherish them as much as I have done.'

Dominic, whose nickname is 'The Spaceman', is one of the top 30 professional snooker champions in the world.

Despite being born in Coventry, he represents Wales and has won the Grand Prix of snooker as well as the prestigious Shanghai Masters.

He regularly appears on television where, in addition to playing, he also appears as a commentator and presenter.
