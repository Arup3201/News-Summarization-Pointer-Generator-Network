A Louisiana newlywed locked in a bitter custody dispute killed his wife and shot dead his ex-mother-in-law and boss before turning the gun on himself Thursday evening.

Ben Freeman, 38, of Houma, killed wife Denise Taylor Freeman, ex-mother-in-law Susan ‘Pixie’ Gouaux and boss Milton Bourgeois before killing himself, officials said. Three others, including a local politician, were injured in the rampage.

Ben Freeman and Denise Freeman were married six months ago. Mr Bourgeois was CEO of the hospital where they both once worked before Mr Freeman was terminated in 2011, according to Houma Today.

The shooting spree began at about 6:30, when Mr Freeman burst into the Lockport home of Lafourche Parish Councilman Louis Gouaux and his wife Pixie, his former in-laws.

Wielding a shotgun, Mr Freeman shot Pixie dead, cops said. Mr Gouaux was shot in the throat, his daughter Andrea also sustained a gunshot wound, cops said in a statement.

The councilman called 911, both he and his daughter made it to a local hospital. They are in critical but stable condition and expected to survive, officials said.

Mr and Mrs Gouaux were the parents of Mr Freeman’s ex-wife Jeanene, she was not in the home when the violent attack occurred.

A second shooting was reported 20 minutes later in nearby Raceland.

Mr Freeman stormed the home of Mr Bourgeois, the CEO of Ochsner St. Anne General Hospital.

The hospital head was shot dead, his wife Ann was shot in the leg, according to Houma Today. She is in stable condition at a local hospital.

Authorities locked down all three hospitals where Mr Freeman had previously been employed while they hunted for him Thursday night.

Holiday tragedy: The shooting came only one day after Christmas

Nine separate agencies on the local, Parish and federal level – including the US Drug Enforcement Administration – searched for the crazed gunman.

Authorities found Mr Freeman before 10:30pm. parked on the side of a road, he was dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.

A subsequent search of the troubled man’s home found the body of wife Denise, authorities have not said how she died.

Authorities speculated to Houma Today 
that Mr Freeman’s rampage was the result of a long-standing feud between
 he and his ex-wife, whom he had four children with.

They told the paper that court orders required Mr Freeman’s visits with his children to be supervised after a series of harassment charges and restraining orders were filed by their mother.

‘Clearly, there has been a very difficult and complicated divorce/custody issue going on,’ Sheriff Craig Webre said during a Thursday night news conference.

‘They have had issues,' he continued, according to WDSU. ‘A number of complaints have been filed since 2012-13, mostly harassment, telephone harassment, text message harassment. During the course of that time there have been at least 2 protective orders. The most recent expired Nov. 30 this year.’

It was not immediately clear why Mr Freeman had lost his job at the hospital run by Mr Bourgeois, but Mr Webre noted police were once called to the facility after the tormented man trashed a patient’s room.

Mr Freeman told administrators he would seek counseling.
