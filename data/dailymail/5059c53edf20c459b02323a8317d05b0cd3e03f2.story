Two young women both battling a rare form of cancer have become great friends after meeting through Facebook.

Robyn Duffy, 21, and Kirsten Smith, 23, were both diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma last year and underwent gruelling rounds of chemotherapy in the same hospital.

But the girls, from Coatbridge, Lanarkshire, have struck up a close friendship after discovering on Facebook that they were practically neighbours.

Close: Robyn Duffy, 21, and Kirsten Smith, 23, were both diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma last year. They have become good friends after discovering on Facebook they were going through the same ordeal

Robyn Duffy, 21. Kirsten got in touch with her after seeing a message of support from another friend on Facebook

They became friends after a message of support sent to Robyn on the social networking site was seen by Kirsten.

She contacted Robyn and the pair discovered they visited the same ward at Monklands Hospital in Airdrie for treatment.

They now comfort each other as they bid to beat their illness and sit side-by-side during hospital appointments.

Robyn said: 'I was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma in September and felt like I was the only person this was happening to.

'My friends and family were very supportive and I received a lot of get well messages on Facebook.

'Then I received a message from Kirsten saying she had seen a post wishing me well.

"She said she was going through the same thing.

Kirsten, 23, said: When I was told I had Hodgkin's I was gobsmacked. You don't expect cancer to happen to you when you are only young

'As we got talking, I was amazed because we were of similar ages, were being treated at the same hospital and lived only a street apart.

'We met up and it was such a comfort to know someone else understood what I was going through.'

The girls are halfway through their treatment and Kirsten has told how they support each other at sessions.

Kirsten said: 'When I was told I had Hodgkin's I was gobsmacked.

'You don't expect cancer to happen to you when you are only young.

'But I was on Facebook and saw a message for another girl that struck a chord with me.

'I realised she was fighting the same kind of cancer and seemed to be getting the same treatments as me.

'We have so much in common even just the fact we only lived one street away from each other.

'I admit I felt a huge wave of comfort.

'This
 isn't something you would wish on anybody, but it helped somehow to 
know that someone just like me was going through the same thing.

'We travel to our appointments together so we can sit and chat and catch up.'

Robyn was diagnosed after a routine chest X-ray as part of a Canadian visa application revealed a mass in her chest.

Kirsten was told she was suffering from cancer after complaining about swelling in her chest.

Kirsten added: 'The day I started losing my hair, Robyn was the first one I texted.

'It is comforting to know there is someone who understands exactly how you feel.'

Robyn said: 'Despite everything, we are still both young and we like all the things other girls our age are into.

'Both of us come to the hospital armed with lots of celebrity gossip magazines.

'That's always a point of discussion with us and we share mags and have a giggle.'

Martin Ledwick, of Cancer Research UK, said: 'Hodgkin's lymphoma, although relatively uncommon, is one of the few cancers that can affect young adults with a peak in the numbers diagnosed in 20-24 year olds.

'The good news is that Hodgkin's responds very well to treatment and many people with it are cured.'

Hodgkin's lymphoma is cancer of the B lymphocytes - a type of white blood cell found in the lymphatic system.

Clear
 fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains 
infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes.

In 
lymphoma, these lymphocytes start to multiply abnormally and begin to 
collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph 
nodes.

The most common symptom is a painless swelling in a gland, most commonly in the neck, armpit or groin.

The cancer is most common in 15 to 35-year-olds and the over 50s. More men than women are affected.

Nearly 1,500 people in the UK are diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma every year.

It
 is one of the most easily treatable forms of cancer - almost all young 
people with Hodgkin's lymphoma will be cured. For older people, the cure
 rate is about 80 per cent.Source: NHS Choices
