A sensational plot by an assassin and a drugs baron to escape jail by helicopter has been foiled by guards.

Gang leader Mark Osborne and hitman Wayne Collins hatched a plan to break-out from Gartree prison in Leicester, which was the scene of Britain's only other helicopter prison escape in 1987.

But guards at the Category B prison were tipped-off about the plan and swooped on their cells, making the duo wear a striped outfit given to 'potential escapees'.

According to the Daily Star Sunday, 
they were then transferred to high-security prisons - Osborne to 
Whitemoor in Cambridgeshire and Collins to Full Sutton in East 
Yorkshire.

A prison insider 
told the paper: 'Osborne and Collins were plotting to escape.They had 
built up a plan and had been raising the funds for the operation for 
months.'

It is believed the pair were to pay for the operation through drug running - both inside and outside prison.

Osborne, 29, and his brother Tony supplied hundreds of thousands of pounds' worth of cocaine in the Romford area of Essex.

They hired gunman Collins to execute Mark Tredinnick in front of his four-year-old son in June 2007.

Mark Osborne used a phone that was smuggled into his jail cell to order the assassination of Tredinnick, 39.

He was shot nine times after being ambushed in a country lane in Romford as partner Kerri Ann Shanahan and their son looked on.

Tredinnick had owed money to Osborne, who was in jail for wounding at the time of the killing. He believed Tredinnick had stolen drugs from him.

The Osbornes and Collins all got life sentences for the murder in 2009.

All three had appeals rejected and it is said the failure sparked the escape plot.

The source added: 'There were suspicions they were still involved in drug dealing and it is believed the money from the drugs was to fund the escape.

'Word is they were getting outsiders to fly a chopper into the yard.'

The only successful helicopter escape in Britain happened at Gartree when murderer Sydney Draper and robber John Kendall fled by air. They were later recaptured.

In March 2009, a plot to free nine Muslim terrorists from Full Sutton using a hijacked helicopter was foiled. Al-Qaida henchmen on the outside planned to hire the chopper, then force the pilot to land at gunpoint.
