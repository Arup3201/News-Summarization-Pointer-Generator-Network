Marijuana use in America and Canada tops most other countries according to a new report by the UN.

The United States, Canada, Nigeria and Australia ranked the highest with more than 10 per cent of their populations aged between 15 and 64 admitting to using the drug. 

Western Europe also has a high marijuana use but did not rank in the top group.

The UN gathered data from people ages 15 to 64 around the world to analyse cannabis consumption

The countries with low use rates included Ecuador, Paraguay, Turkey and Romania.

Surprisingly, Mexico's use of the drug was low despite despite most of America's marijuana coming from the country.

The report said: 'While cannabis herb is grown in almost every country in the world, the producrion of cannabis resin is confined to only a few countries in North Africa, the Middle East and South-West Asia. 

'The largest quantities of cannabis herb were seized in North America, which accounts for 64 oer cent of seizures worldwide.'

When comparing prices worldwide, cannabis herb is found to be relatively inexpensive in North America, cheapest in Africa and South Asia and most expensive in East and South-East Asia.

In 2012, between 125million and 227million people estimated to have used cannabis - that's 2.7 to 4.9 per cent of the population. 

Over the past five years in North America, the largest cannabis hreb market, prevalence rates have followed an upward trend but declined in Canada between 2008 and 2011 but rising between 2011 and 2012.

Recent policy changes means the production, distribution and consumption of marijuana is legal in Uruguay and in the states of Washington and Colorado. 

Although little research is available on the topic, experts estimate cartel losses of nearly $3billion from the initiatives that passed in Colorado and Washington. 

However, in the state of California, researchers concluded that legal changes would not be enough to diminish the market for Mexican cannabis. 

The report adds: 'Global cannabis use seems to have decreased, essentially reflecting a decrease in cannabis use estimates reported by a number of countries in Western and Central Europe. 

'However, in the United States, the lower perceived risk of cannabis use has led to an increase in its use.

'At the same time, more people using cannabis are seeking treatment each year.'
