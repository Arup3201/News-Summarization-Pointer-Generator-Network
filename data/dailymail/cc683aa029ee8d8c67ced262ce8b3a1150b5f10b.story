Natural: Ulrika Jonsson has spoken out against airbrushing and admits that she prefers her more natural look

It is a magic way to banish wrinkles, eliminate pimples, and even smooth cellulite.

So it comes as no surprise that most celebrities aren't averse to a spot of airbrushing.

But as the public backlash against the magic wand builds, one famous face has spoken out against the appearance-enhancing tool and presenter Ulrika Jonsson, 46, insists that she prefers her more natural look without the help of airbrushing.

In an article in The Sun Swedish
star Ulrika, who has graced the cover of many magazines throughout her 
career, explains that, to her knowledge she has never been subjected to 
airbrushing and she wouldn't have it any other way.

'Of course, I’d love the world to fawn 
over my perfect body. But there is a huge part of me which feels that 
would be dishonest — to me and everyone else,' she writes.

To
exemplify her point, the mother-of-four allowed the newspaper to 
airbrush a photograph of her in a swimming costume, which she compares 
to a natural shot of herself.

Speaking about the pre-airbrushed shot, she writes: 'It shows a woman not in bad shape for her age.'

But adds that there are tell-tale signs of her years of sunbathing and four pregnancies.

She does, however, admit that the airbrushed shot has transformed her.

Despite
the airbrushing smoothing out her wrinkles and banishing 
discolouration, she concludes that she prefers the natural version 
because it shows the 'real deal'.

Then and now: The Swedish star believes that her face now (R) shows signs of her sun-worshiping ways. (L) Fresh-faced in 1994

Ulrika was inspired to take a stance 
against airbrushing after high-street giant Debenhams announced a ban on
all retouched lingerie model shots and Dove vowed to use only real 
women in their campaign.

She believes that photoshopping and editing has become so commonplace that young girls are
bombarded with paragons of beauty daily and worries for her two young 
daughters who are constantly comparing themselves to impeccable 
celebrities.

The Swedish 
star added: 'I don’t like my bow legs, that I have a deep frown line, 
lines on my face that look like a map of the London Underground and that
my ar*e is saggy and droopy. But that’s me.'
