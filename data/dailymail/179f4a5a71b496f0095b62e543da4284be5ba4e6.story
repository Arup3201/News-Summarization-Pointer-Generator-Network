Matthew Gonzalez allegedly told police he communicated with his neighbor's dog prior to shooting his ex-girlfriend 

Authorities say an Albuquerque man accused of shooting his ex-girlfriend on Tuesday told police his neighbor's dog told him to do it.

KRQE-TV in Albuquerque reports that 48-year-old Matthew Gonzales told investigators that the dog gave him the advice after Gonzales saw his ex-girlfriend's status update on social media. 

Gonzales says he was angry about his ex-girlfriend announcing that she was single.

According to court documents, Gonzales says the dog told him, 'you need to take care of this.'

Police say Gonzales shot his ex-girlfriend during a struggle on Tuesday. 

According to court documents when police arrived they saw a woman lying on the ground with an apparent gunshot wound to her head.

She was conscious when she arrived at the hospital and told the staff that her boyfriend arrived at her home that morning and was arguing with her.

She then told police that because her family was at her home at the time she got into a car to discuss things with her ex-boyfriend so as not to upset them.

She says that he drove her short distance and the next thing she remembered was that she was lying on the ground on the street.

Court documents state that police discovered Matthew Gonzales at Legacy Church where he supposedly admitted to his pastor that he shot his ex-girlfriend.

When police confronted Gonzales, he waived his Miranda Rights and said that his neighbour has a dog that communicates with him.

He told police that he initially planned on ending his own life in front of his girlfriend so that she would 'know how he felt' about her single status on Facebook.

Police say Matthew told them that he drove to his sister's house to borrow a gun and he took the gun to his ex-girlfriend’s house where he arrived unannounced.

She and her 10-year-old daughter exited the house as he demanded and he insisted that his ex-girlfriend get into his car and that her daughter go to the neighbor's house.

'Don’t make me drag you into the car,' he reportedly said.

He allegedly pulled a gun from his pocket and his ex-girlfriend fearfully obliged.

Matthew told police that as he drove his girlfriend she was 'freaking out' and shaking.

The court document states that when the ex-girlfriend saw Gonzales staring into oncoming traffic she opened the door and tried to get out of the car.

Gonzales, with a gun in his right pocket, allegedly tried to grab her and he also discharged his gun one time.

She fell to the ground. 

He then allegedly drove to the Mesa to commit suicide but after calling his boss he was advised to talk to his pastor.

Gonzales faces a number of charges, including kidnapping and aggravated battery. He is being held on a $150,000 bond.

It was not known if he had an attorney.
