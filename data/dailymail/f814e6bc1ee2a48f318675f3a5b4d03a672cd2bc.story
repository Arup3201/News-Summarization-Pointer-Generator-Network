Texas Governor Rick Perry has caused a firestorm by comparing likening homosexuality to a disorder that people can avoid like alcoholism.

The former Republican presidential candidate made the controversial remarks while speaking at a conference in San Francisco, and while most of the event focused on economic issues, an audience member asked about a new program in Texas that aims to 'cure' gay and lesbian clients.

In response to a question about it, Perry said he did not know whether the therapy worked before he was further asked if he thought homosexuality was a disorder.

Sparking controversy: Texan Governor Rick Perry made the remark during a Wednesday evening event in San Francisco

The San Francisco Chronicle says that the governor responded that 'whether or not you feel compelled to follow a particular lifestyle or not, you have the ability to decide not to do that.'

He said: 'I may have the genetic coding that I'm inclined to be an alcoholic, but I have the desire not to do that, and I look at the homosexual issue the same way.' 

The paper added that while the event in famously-liberal San Francisco was packed with Republicans but there was even an audible mumbling immediately after the remark.

This is not the first time he has drawn that comparison: he wrote in his 2008 book that while he is 'no expert on the 'nature versus nurture' debate, he argued that there were parallels between homosexuality and alcoholism. He went on to suggest that homosexuals should abstain from sex.

The Texas Republican platform stand on the issue is in contrast to California and New Jersey, which have previously banned licensed professionals from providing such therapy to minors.

Economic principles: Much of the Texan governor's trip to California was meant to focus on different economic initiatives, like the work being done at Tesla Motors

During the bulk of his talk, Perry held up his own state as a model for responsible energy production and economic growth in California.

Perry said he believes Texas is leading the way in achieving energy independence by producing crude oil and electricity in many forms, including solar power.

Perry also suggested that deregulating electricity had started a boom for renewable energy in Texas, which he called the nation's leading developer of wind energy.

Perry said shale drilling techniques had doubled oil production in Texas, and he urged Californians to tap the full energy potential in its Monterey Shale.

On Tuesday, Perry drove up to California's state capital of Sacramento in a Tesla Model S electric car — underscoring his desire to lure a Tesla battery factory to Texas.
