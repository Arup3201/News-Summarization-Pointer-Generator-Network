Whitehall staff are being paid extra bonuses worth thousands of pounds just for their job, it emerged today.

Extra allowances are given to civil servants for being good at typing, knowing first aid, being green and working late.

Critics said the payouts were outdated and must be abolished at a time of austerity.

Civil servants can receive more than £1,000 for 'proficient typing' under a raft of extra Whitehall allowances

Dozens of staff in government departments and agencies are eligible for the extra cash on top of their salaries.

At Eric Pickles' Department for Communities and Local Government, staff can receive £144 for being a fire marshal, £200 as a first aider and £600 in a 'green allowance'.

They can also be paid £3,160-a-year for being on call and up to £1,092 for 'typing proficiency'.

Spending on the allowances and subsidies last year was £946,600, 23 per cent higher than in 2011-12.

Spending on allowances at the Audit Commission last year totalled £1.664million, and at the Planning Inspectorate £360,885.

Other perks available include a £2,325 ‘disturbance allowance’ for when staff have to work away from home.

A separate payout of £684-a-year is made to civil servants who work from home.

New staff cannot receive the extra money, which is only available to long-serving civil servants.

Tory MP Priti Patel, who uncovered the allowances, said the government must stop ‘the cycle of rewards for people just for doing their day job’

She told the Telegraph: ‘This is the 21st century. The labour market has changed and these allowances must be abolished.’

A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said: ‘Only a very small number of people receive these allowances, most of which do not have origins in the Department for Communities and Local Government.

‘The department had to honour existing terms and conditions for staff that transferred over from arms length bodies that were closed down as part of the Government's restructuring. They are not available to anyone else.

‘Some also address specific recruitment and retention issues around business critical posts that require professional skills such as accountancy.

‘The department is in the process of reviewing its pay policies, including allowances and subsidies, as part of wider civil service reform and ensuring good value for public money.’
