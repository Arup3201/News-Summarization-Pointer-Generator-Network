Is #pot2blame for criminal behavior? HLN's Nancy Grace thinks so. But to argue the other side of the debate, she brought in an unlikely adversary - the rapper 2 Chainz. 

Grace invited the 37-year-old 'I'm Different' rapper on HLN to speak his piece about why marijuana should be legalized. In a 50-minute segment, the two went back and forth in a heated debate.

Grace was well prepared to back up her opinion that marijuana should not be legalized.

Heated: Grace invited the 37-year-old 'I'm Different' rapper on HLN to speak his piece about why marijuana should be legalized. In a 50-minute segment, the two went back and forth in a heated debate

Grace illustrated her case with footage of marijuana-related crimes, 2 Chainz smoking, and even tackled 2 Chainz 'Feds Watching' lyrics

She showed the rapper footage of several recent cases involving marijuana, including parents who forced their toddlers to spoke the substance.

Grace repeatedly urged the rapper to look at the footage of a man forcing a two-year-old to smoke marijuana as she argued that people cannot be trusted to act responsibly with the drug.

'That's what makes me keep arguing about this, 2 Chainz,' the former prosecutor said referring to the disturbing footage, 'people like this.' 

2 Chainz -- born Tauheed Epps -- was ready with a reply.

'These people are imbeciles,' the rapper responded calmly.  'You can't use this case to define a community.' 

'We still cool:' 2 Chainz posted on Twitter that he and Grace are 'still cool,' and said that Fox's Bill O' Reilly is 'up next'

'You're on:' Grace took the heat to Twitter and even insulted the rapper's Rolex -- but, thankfully, not his two chains

The journalist said that though she is not labeling what 2 Chainz called the 'stoner community,' the legalization of pot would only lead to more disturbing cases of the substance being misused.

The rapper, who Grace noted graduated from college with a 4.0 GPA, countered that the benefits of legalizing marijuana far outweigh the risks. 

'If we got half of the states legalizing pot, if the rest of the community legalizes pot that frees up taxpayers' money,' 2 Chainz said, 'that'll allow us to do something with this extra, with these funds, from fixing potholes in the street to building stadiums. I'm down with that.'

Attacking from every angle, Grace showed footage from the rapper's Twitter feed which featured him smoking marijuana.

After showing footage from one of the rapper's music videos, she asked about his lyrics.

Instagram: The two spoke their piece on air and the rapper posted a friendly photo of the two on his Instagram page

She said that though some of the lyrics are 'incredible,' some of his other lyrics glorify a lifestyle that small children should not be exposed to.

The rapper was unfazed. 

'I'm a great father, I just feel like, you know, everybody should basically take care of their own,' the father-of-two responded. 

'It's about governing your own household, it's about taking care of your own property, it's about having some kind of structure.' 

Grace was adamant and even went as far as to quote 2 Chainz 'Feds Watching' lyrics in a hilarious display.

The two spoke their piece on air and the rapper posted a friendly photo of the two on his Instagram page, but Grace didn't end it there. She took the debate to Twitter and even insulted the rapper's Rolex -- but, thankfully, not his two chains.

All ended well though, 2 Chainz posted on Twitter that he and Grace are 'still cool,' and said that Fox's Bill O' Reilly is 'up next.'
