President Obama has called the murders of three Muslim students in North Carolina 'brutal and outrageous' while suggesting they were targeted for 'who they were'.

The president released the statement on Friday afternoon, three days after Yusor Mohammad, 21, her husband Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23, and her sister, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19, were shot execution-style inside their Chapel Hill home, allegedly by their neighbor Craig Hicks.

While police have said the murders followed a long-standing parking dispute between the neighbors, the victims' families and friends have called for it to be investigated as a hate crime.

'No one in the United States of America should ever be targeted because of who they are, what they look like, or how they worship,' Obama said in a statement on Friday, suggesting he shares the view.

Condolences: President Obama, pictured on Thursday, has released a statement about the killings, calling them 'brutal and outrageous'. The FBI has now launched its own investigation into the deaths

'Yesterday, the FBI opened an inquiry into the brutal and outrageous murders of Yusor Mohammad Abu-Salha, Deah Shaddy Barakat, and Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. In addition to the ongoing investigation by local authorities, the FBI is taking steps to determine whether federal laws were violated.

'No one in the United States of America should ever be targeted because of who they are, what they look like, or how they worship. Michelle and I offer our condolences to the victims' loved ones.

'As we saw with the overwhelming presence at the funeral of these young Americans, we are all one American family. Whenever anyone is taken from us before their time, we remember how they lived their lives – and the words of one of the victims should inspire the way we live ours.

"Growing up in America has been such a blessing," Yusor said recently. "It doesn’t matter where you come from. There’s so many different people from so many different places, of different backgrounds and religions – but here, we’re all one."

He added that the FBI have now 'opened an inquiry into the brutal and outrageous murders... to determine whether federal laws were violated'.

'Michelle and I offer our condolences to the victims' loved ones,' he said.  

His comments came after Barakat's brother, Farris Barakat, revealed that Yusor had been so afraid of the neighbor that they had joked about getting her a gun.

Speaking to ABC News, Farris Barakat recalled another incident where Hicks had yelled at him for parking in the wrong space while visiting his brother.

He said he responded calmly - as did his brother - so that they did not upset Hicks any further. 

He added that the neighbor had also turned up to his brother's home wearing a gun on his belt, matching other stories shared by friends.

But as questions remain over whether the students were targeted over their religion, he said he had never heard Hicks make anti-Muslim remarks towards his brother. 

Police rushed to the condos in Chapel Hill on Tuesday afternoon after neighbors called 911 to report the sounds of gunshots followed by screams and more gunshots - then silence.

A few hours later, 46-year-old Craig Hicks - a married paralegal student and a former car parts salesman - turned himself in to authorities.

He has now been transferred from a county jail in Durham, to the state prison in Raleigh because of security concerns, prison authorities said. He is being held without bail. 

Accused: Craig Hicks, 46, is pictured entering the courtroom for his first appearance at the Durham County Detention Center on Wednesday, after he allegedly shot the three students to death on Tuesday

Mourning: Farris Barakat, pictured at the funeral for his brother Deah Barakat on Thursday, has said his sister-in-law was fearful of her neighbor and joked about getting her own weapon

The killings are fueling outrage among people who blame anti-Muslim rhetoric for hate crimes. 

Hicks made regular posts on social media slamming religion and its followers, and referring to himself as an 'anti-theist'. On Wednesday, neighbors said he always seemed angry and confrontational, while his ex-wife said he showed 'no compassion at all' for other people.

But his wife Karen Hicks insisted that the deaths came after a long-standing parking dispute and said he often championed equality for others.

The women's father, Mohammad Abu-Salha, countered that he's convinced it was a hate crime.

'The media here bombards the American citizen with Islamic, Islamic, Islamic terrorism and makes people here scared of us and hate us and want us out. So if somebody has any conflict with you, and they already hate you, you get a bullet in the head,' said Abu-Salha, a psychiatrist.

A Muslim advocacy organization also pressed authorities to investigate possible religious bias. Many posted social media updates with the hashtag #MuslimLivesMatter. 

Demands: At a press conference on Tuesday, Barakat's family called on authorities to investigate it as a hate crime. On Thursday, the FBI announced it had launched its own investigation into the shooting

Loved: Thousands of mourners attended funerals for the young students in Raleigh on Thursday

'We understand the concerns about the possibility that this was hate-motivated, and we will exhaust every lead to determine if that is the case,' Chapel Hill police Chief Chris Blue said in an email.

Chapel Hill Police asked the FBI for help in their probe, and Ripley Rand, the U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of North Carolina, said his office was monitoring the investigation.  

On Thursday, as many as five thousand mourners gathered in Raleigh for the funerals of the three victims. The service was held on an athletic field to fit the crowds. 

'I call upon the President of the United States, Barack Obama... please involve the FBI. Please investigate,' Mohammad Abu-Salha, the father of Yusor and Razan, pleaded at the service. 'This has hate crime written all over it.'

He went on: 'We're not sad. We have peace inside. We are not seeking petty revenge. Our children are much more valuable than any revenge. We care about acknowledging this the way it is.'

A charity page set up by Deah Barakat to raise funds for dental care for displaced Syrians has raised more than $310,000. Before his death, its total was just over $20,000.
