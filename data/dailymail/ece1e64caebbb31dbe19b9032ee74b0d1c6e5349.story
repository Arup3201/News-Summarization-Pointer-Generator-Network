They say that only in adversity can you truly know a man.

In which case, anyone watching the Bundesliga this season must be getting pretty intimate with Jurgen Klopp.

Just like Brian Clough — capable of getting once routinelooking players to perform and win at the elite level, and packed full of explosive, colourful outbursts — Klopp is iconic in the rise and rise of German football.

Not only a gift to Borussia Dortmund and their remarkable support, the Bundesliga needs to calculate Klopp’s worth to their marketing and identity.

His talent, his achievements and, above all, his German Boris Johnson persona have all been a small part of Saturday night's ‘German Clasico’ being beamed live to 208 of the 209 FIFA nations (with North Korea missing out as Kim Jung-un was fighting, and beating, Floyd Mayweather for the WBC Welterweight crown, he says).

Marco Reus gave Dortmund the lead on Saturday night in Munich but Arjen Robben hit Bayern’s late winner from the spot after Robert Lewandowski had levelled, leaving Klopp’s side sitting third-bottom.

Though football isn’t renowned for its measured analysis of difficult times, it has been confusing and disappointing to see the amount of angst and headscratching involved in assessing the hard times suffered by Dortmund these past few weeks.

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was allowed leeway to argue that the departure of a single player, Luis Suarez, had set back his project — leaving his team underperforming in both league and Champions League.

Pound for pound, the troubles which Klopp has had to cope with in the past two seasons dwarf that.

This season, Dortmund are without one of the top strikers in the world in Lewandowski. That follows the loss — also to Bayern — of World Cup Final-winning scorer Mario Gotze.

Now let’s ladle on top of that the many months spent without a handful of Dortmund’s other key players: Ilkay Gundogan, Reus, Neven Subotic, Mats Hummels and Jakub Błaszczykowski. It would be the equivalent of Barcelona being stripped of Lionel Messi, Neymar, Andres Iniesta, Gerard Pique and Jordi Alba.

Where the uninitiated have shown least comprehension is in failing to understand that because Hummels and Subotic have returned, it doesn’t suggest that they are even close to their best form — which is partially why Dortmund, who have rarely dominated in their poor domestic run, keep losing very soft goals.

The form of keeper Roman Weidenfeller has also been patchy. Domestically, the absence of Lewandowski has been catastrophic but, in the Champions League, it is just the reverse. 

Faced with teams who do not know them inside out, relieved of the burden of expectation that comes with competing for the title with the team which keeps robbing their stars (Bayern are now on record as wanting to sign Reus this summer), Dortmund have been on jet-propelled form.

Top of Arsenal’s group, they have won all three games, scoring nine and conceding none. Klopp’s Bundesliga bunglers have the best record in the Champions League — ahead of Bayern, Real Madrid and Chelsea.

One calm voice amidst their painful loss of form has been their former Champions League-winning coach Ottmar Hitzfeld, who said: ‘Even though Lewandowski was a big loss for Dortmund, few would have expected them to make this kind of start to the season.

‘Of course, they had a lengthy injury list, new players needed to be integrated and the players that went to the World Cup either took time to regain their form or still need time to.

Dortmund are performing well in the cup competitions but are struggling in the Bundesliga, sitting 16th

However, I get the impression it is more to do with the fact Dortmund aren’t used to losing.

They haven’t had a losing streak like this since 2000.’ Nor is the 65-year-old thrown by, the vast chasm of difference in quality between their European campaign, which continues this week at home to Galatasaray, and their Bundesliga work. ‘Teams performing at contrasting levels in different competitions happens quite a lot,’ he said.

‘You could also point towards it being a psychological problem because Dortmund have nearly always been the better side this season, especially on home soil. They just seem to have forgotten how to score goals. ‘The players’ confidence also takes a knock with each defeat. Then they become too eager to push forward in search of goals and the dilemma becomes bigger.’

As serious as Klopp takes the club’s predicament, and as hurt as he was by losing his superstars to Bayern, he has remained sanguine in adversity.

Dortmund’s Westfalenstadion has arguably the most boisterous atmosphere of any ground in Europe

‘Common sense is my biggest skill,’ he said. ‘To understand life, and to see football as only a part of this, then to help my players understand what happens at a given time on the pitch or during the season.

‘Players are handled like superstars and sometimes need help to find the right way — and that’s my job. It’s not wholly important whether you win or lose the last game. It’s about the answers rather than the emotion of the moment. ‘There will always be questions and, as a coach, you have to have the answers.'

Bet on Klopp to find them.
