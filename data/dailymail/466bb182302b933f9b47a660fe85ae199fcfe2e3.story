A Jetstar Pacific plane almost collided with another aircraft  after a young intern was left in charge of directing a busy runway at an airport in Vietnam.

An air traffic controller has been suspended and his aviation licence revoked after leaving the trainee in charge of the runway at Da Nang Airport on June 27, the Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam said.

The Jetstar plane had been instructed by the trainee to take off from the same runway where a Vietnam Airlines flight had just landed from Ho Chi Minh City.

The error caused the planes to come within 350m of each other.

'The incident seriously threatened aviation safety. If it had not been spotted in a timely manner, it would have led to an accident,' a CAAV statement said.

It was only after the Vietnam Airlines pilot informed air traffic control that his plane was still on the runway that the intern realised the mistake, Tuoi Tre newspaper reports.
