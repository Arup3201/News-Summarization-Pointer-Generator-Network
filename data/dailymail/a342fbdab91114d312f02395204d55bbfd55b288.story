Dallas Cowboys running back Joseph Randle won't be suspended after his arrest on a shoplifting charge.

Cowboys coach Jason Garrett said on Wednesday that Randle will be fined 'significantly' but will play in the NFL on Sunday against the New York Giants.

Randle was charged with misdemeanor theft of between $50 (£31.30) and $500 (£313) after he was accused of taking $123 (£77) worth of cologne and underwear from a department store at a suburban Dallas mall on Monday. He was detained by store security, taken to jail, and posted bond early Tuesday.

The arrest came a day after one of Randle's best games in two seasons with Dallas in a 30-23 victory against Super Bowl champion Seattle. He had a 38-yard run and a key tackle on a late kickoff.

According to an arrest report, Randle was caught on video placing items later identified as a 'tester' bottle of Gucci Guilty Black cologne and a two-pack of Polo underwear into a Dillard's bag after making a purchase at the store at Stonebriar Centre, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of Dallas.

The 22-year-old Randle was stopped by a security guard in the parking lot and later told a police officer that when he saw the 'old guy,' referring to the security guard, he thought to himself, 'All right, y'all got me.'

Randle returned to the store and the items were recovered. The cost of the items was $123.50 (£77.45) before sales tax. Randle is in the second year of a four-year, $2.3 million (£1.4m) rookie contract with a base salary of $495,000 (£310,000) this season.

Randle declined to talk to reporters in the locker room on Tuesday.
