'Socialist': Ed Miliband, pictured, was accused of being a 'card carrying Marxist' by Sir John Ritblat

One of Britain’s top businessmen has accused Ed Miliband of being a ‘card carrying Marxist’ who is ‘unfit to govern’.

In the latest salvo from a captain of industry, Sir John Ritblat also accused the Labour leader of ‘learning nothing and forgetting everything’ from the financial crisis.

Sir John, who bought British Land for £1million in 1970 and transformed it into one of the UK’s biggest and most successful companies, voiced concerns that a Labour government would ‘pick up some of the flaws of the French economy’.

He said: ‘I would simply say there is a problem when the leadership is obviously very inexperienced, has never been involved in commerce and whose family tradition is one of left wing, totally unreconstructed, card carrying Marxists. This is not a good basis for pragmatic government.’

The 79-year-old City grandee, who was responsible for transforming the skyline of London with the development of the giant Broadgate office complex in the heart of the City, added: ‘This all adds to the impression that Mr Miliband is unfit to govern’.

Last night one of Britain’s leading fashion entrepreneurs Harold Tillman also joined the backlash against Labour, accusing it of wanting to ‘stamp on aspiration.’

Arguing Mr Miliband warrants his ‘Red Ed’ nickname, Mr Tillman - who previously owned British fashion chain Jaeger - said: ‘I am only just realising how socialist Miliband is. I am shocked at this, but Labour sound as if they want to stamp on aspiration.’

The criticism will be blow to Labour, which this week slipped behind the Tories in the polls following a series of bruising battles with big businesses.

A succession of company bosses have raised concerns about a lurch to the left under a Labour government and accused the party of not supporting business and enterprise.

Labour’s plans to freeze energy prices and break up the banks recently prompted former Marks & Spencer boss Lord Rose to brand Mr Miliband a ‘1970s throwback’ whose policies echo those of the socialist Labour government of that era.

Mr Miliband’s late father Ralph was a Marxist intellectual who rose to prominence in the 1960s and 1970s.

The opposition leader has spoken of the formative influence of his father, recalling political discussions around the dinner table at the family home in Primrose Hill.

Mr Miliband also alarmed the business community after cosying up to Francois Hollande’s socialist French government after its 2012 victory.

Last week one of the world’s biggest investment banks, Bank of America warned Labour would reduce Britain to an economic basketcase like France, with stunted growth and soaring unemployment.

Sir John Ritblat, who retired from British Land in 2006 and is now chairman of family property company Delancey which is involved in redeveloping the Olympic village site in East London, said:

‘I don’t want to go the way of France and other high tax regimes, but there is a real danger that we could end up picking up some of the flaws of the French economy (under Labour)’.

Referring to the financial crisis which started under the previous Labour government, Sir John - a Conservative Party donor - said:

‘It is very disappointing that the Labour leaders have learnt nothing and forgotten everything.

This collective amnesia about the damage caused to the economy under the previous Labour government is extraordinary’.

Mr Miliband was ridiculed for failing to mention the near £100billion budget deficit in his party conference speech last September.

The concerns among business leaders were echoed by fashion entrepreneur Harold Tillman, 69.

He said: ‘Labour would be very bad for the economy and very bad for employment. We need to be creating a nation of entrepreneurs. It is idiotic to criticise businesses.’

The boss of one of the country’s leading manufacturers also warned of the danger of returning to failed 1970’s socialism under a Labour government.

John Neill, the chief executive of motor parts and logistics giant Unipart , which was carved out of the old British Leyland empire, said he has bad memories of the 1970s when British Leyland was riven by strikes.

He said he is worried about the risk of going back to the ‘failed models of the past’.

Attacking Mr Miliband’s plans to freeze energy prices as ‘harebrained’, he said:

‘We cannot afford to be complacent. Think about China. How do we compete, how do we achieve that if we go back to the failed models of the past. I am concerned we might do that yes.

Labour has come under attack from a long list of prominent businessmen, including Sir Charles Dunston, the co-founder of Carphone Warehouse and Sir Ian Cheshire, who ran the DIY chain B&Q.
