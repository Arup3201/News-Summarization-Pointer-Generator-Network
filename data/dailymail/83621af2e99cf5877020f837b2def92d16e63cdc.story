A homeschooled beauty queen from Nebraska who disappeared on Sunday night has been found safe in Indianapolis.

Michaela Wells was found in good condition in a home in Indianapolis on Thursday though no information has been released about whose house she was in and how she traveled around 570 miles to her final destination.

'How did she get there and why is she there and was it of her own free will? You know, that's the question that I have now,' Michaela's mother Theresa Norris told local station KETV.

Found: Michaeal Wells, who was crowned USA National Miss Nebraska in 2013, was found safe in a home in Indianapolis four days after disappearing from her grandmother's house in Nebraska

Quite the distance: The drive from Bellevue to Indianapolis takes around nine hours

Friends told investigators that the 16-year-old was in a good mood ahead of her March 3 disappearance because she had recently been asked out on a date, but police have not released the name of the boy and made any statements about whether or not he was involved.

Police in her hometown of Bellevue, Nebraska teamed up with the FBI and authorities in Indiana for the search.

She was found at the unidentified residence at 8.20pm local time on Thursday.

'It is such a relief and excitement all in one,' Mrs Norris told The Omaha World Herald.

Theories: Her parents first thought Wells had seen a friend outside and hitched a ride to IHOP. But she didn't return home that night or the next

Things ahead: Her parents and friends thought she was happy ahead of her disappearance because Michaela, 16, had just been asked out on a date and was getting ready for this year's pageant

'We have questions. I am as anxious for details.'

Until then, she said that she will be waiting at home for her daughter's return with her favorite snack- a peanut butter and jelly sandwich- ready.

Michaela was the 2013 winner of the USA National Miss Nebraska Teen competition and had spent the day before her disappearance gown shopping with her mother for this year's pageant in Florida.

She disappeared when she took out the trash out while staying at her grandmother's eastern Nebraska home and never came back inside.

In addition to her upcoming date, Michaela also had a high school 'military ball' to look forward to.

Her friends were in shock at her disappearance as some of them had just talked to her the afternoon before she vanished to make plans for the week.

No other details about where she was found- or how she traveled the nearly 600 miles to get to Indianapolis- have been released
