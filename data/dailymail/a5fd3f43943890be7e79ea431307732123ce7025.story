Jade Jarratt has been left furious after her son Jaron Smith scaled a school fence and walked home without his teachers noticing

The mother of a five-year-old boy has hit out at her son's school after he managed to scale a playground fence and complete the 10-minute walk home without teachers noticing.

Jade Jarratt assumed her son Jaron Smith was happily enjoying this day at Cobblers Lane Primary School in Pontefract, West Yorkshire,  after he was dropped off at the gate.

But she was left horrified when the youngster suddenly strolled through their front door at 1pm - having walked across a busy main road unaccompanied.

Warehouse worker and mother-of-three Miss Jarratt said: 'Jaron had to cross two roads to get back to our house and anything could have happened in that time.

'One of them is a main road that is really busy and I would never let him cross that on his own.

'I was told by the headteacher that a member of staff had asked him to come away from the fence because it had been raining and it was wet.

'But despite them seeing him by the fence, he's still managed to get over without anybody going after him.

'I was really upset when I realised he was on his own. I was crying and just thinking about all the things that could have happened. So many things were going through my head.

'It is a seven-foot fence and has parts of the fence sticking out at the top, so he could have really hurt himself.

'He told me that a friend had told him to do it and then he said he was really scared climbing down the other side and just wanted to come home to see his mum.'

Miss Jarratt, who is also mother to two-year-old Tylen Northway and one-year-old Emzileigh Northway, said she is still waiting for an apology from the school.

Miss Jarratt said: 'The incident is appalling. It's not a bad school by any means but you put a lot of trust in teachers to look after your children and this has made me doubt that. Anything could have happened to Jaron.

'He had to cross Baghill Lane on his way home, which is a busy road. He could have been hit by a car or someone could have taken him.

'The first thing I heard from the school was when I was on my way to take Jaron back there.

'The headteacher rang to ask if Jaron had turned up at home. It's a good job he had as nobody from the school had gone after him. I am far from happy about the way the school dealt with the incident.'

Miss Jarratt drove Jaron back to school  and was met by his father Robert Smith, 28, who works at the nearby One Stop, before going to see the headteacher.

She added: 'The headteacher didn't even apologise for what happened. She said it was his responsibility not to climb the fence but he is a five-year-old.

'They have a duty of care to protect our children and I don't feel like they have done that.'

Headteacher Karen Briggs said she was confident school staff followed procedures when dealing with the incident last Thursday and the family had been kept 'fully informed.'

Mrs Briggs said: 'The safety and well being of all pupils is always a top priority in our school.

'However, we are never complacent when it comes to child safety and will be reviewing this to see if there's anything we could have done to prevent this happening.

'We kept the family fully informed during the incident. The parents brought the child back to school on the same day.

'When we spoke to the parents they said they were happy with how the school had dealt with the incident.

'Teachers have spoken to pupils and have reiterated the importance of not climbing the fence or leaving school premises unsupervised.'
