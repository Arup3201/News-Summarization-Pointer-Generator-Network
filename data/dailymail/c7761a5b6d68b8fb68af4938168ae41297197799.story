Jailed: Peter Hislop attacked a former soldier in a nightclub

Two men who attacked a former solider because he was wearing a badge honouring fallen servicemen have been sentenced to two years behind bars.

Tattoo faced Peter Hislop and Dean Connor called victim Carl Hicks a scumbag, hit him with a bottle and stamped on him as he lay helpless on the floor of a night club in Exeter.

The unprovoked attack, which resulted in Mr Hicks needing 22 stitches in head wounds, started after the two men asked Mr Hicks about his badge and he replied that he had kept it on from a Remembrance service.

Terry Holder, prosecuting, said witnesses saw both defendants punching 
and kicking Mr Hicks in the EX4 club in the centre of Exeter.

One witness reported seeing Mr Hislop balancing with one hand on 
the bar as he stamped on his head.

Mr
Hicks suffered three large cuts to his head and a smaller one on his 
shoulder, as well as two black eyes and severe facial bruising.

Mr Hislop, a 23-year-old bouncer, from Cockwood in Devon, and Mr Connor, 22, a digger driver from Exeter, admitted causing grievous bodily harm to 34-year-old Mr Hicks.

They were both jailed for two years by Judge Francis Gilbert, QC, at Exeter Crown Court.

He told them: 'You attacked a man who was on his own in a night club and once he was on the ground you kicked and stamped on him, causing wounds to his head that required multiple stitches.

'He was a stranger to both of you. 
Hislop noticed a badge and asked him what it was and he said it was a 
veteranâ€™s badge which he wore because he had been in the army.

'You
called him a scumbag and he says all of a sudden something hit the back
of his head which felt like a bottle and someone tried to strangle him.

'This
was an attack for nothing which could have left him with permanent 
damage. It has left him very shocked and caused the return of the post 
traumatic stress disorder which led to him leaving the forces.

'He
is still suffering the effects and it is very fortunate you did not 
cause more serious injury. Stamping is a vile and vicious way to attack 
someone, which can cause fatal injuries.

'That is what you did. It was quite deliberate and repeated. There was no justification for it. You used your shoes as weapons.'

Mr Edward Bailey and Mr David Evans, defending, said they did not have any animosity against former soldiers or the army and the attack had resulted from an argument at the club.

They said they both regret their actions and wish to apologise to the victim.
