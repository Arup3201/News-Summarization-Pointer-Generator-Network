The revelations undermine the Trussell Trust's claims last week about how many people are using food banks

Volunteers for a charity that blames welfare cuts for the soaring use of its food banks have admitted that fraudsters routinely ‘take advantage’ of the handouts.

The Trussell Trust, the UK’s biggest provider of food banks – which highlighted a ‘shocking’ rise in demand for emergency food packages last week – last night pledged to investigate after volunteers were filmed admitting that people could take free food without checks, and that many visitors were asylum-seekers.

One worker at a bank run by the trust said that people regularly ‘bounce around’ locations to receive more vouchers than they are entitled to.

A Mail on Sunday investigation has also found inadequate checks on who claims the vouchers, after a reporter obtained three days’ worth of food simply by telling staff at a Citizen’s Advice Bureau – without any proof – that he was unemployed.

Undercover reporters posing as volunteers at food banks in London and Nottinghamshire also found:

According to the Trussell Trust’s statistics, more than 913,000 people received three days’ emergency food from its banks in 2013-14 compared with 347,000 in 2012-13.

The charity, which runs more than 400 of Britain’s 1,000 food banks, acknowledged that a third of the food was given to repeat visitors, but insisted the rise was based on genuine need for emergency food.

Individuals experiencing severe financial hardship are able to claim food vouchers but there are no clear criteria on who should be eligible. Once received, the vouchers can be exchanged for three days’ worth of food at an allotted centre.

The Trussell Trust has a policy that an individual can claim no more than nine handouts in a year, but undercover reporters found this limit varied in different branches.

One volunteer at Trussell Trust-run food bank in Waterloo, who had been helping the charity for more than a year, said that he regularly saw the same people claiming more food parcels than they were in entitled to.

Volunteer filmed by MoS at Trussell Trust's London Waterloo food bank: 'People take advantage... they bounce around different locations to get the vouchers'

Staff at Nottingham’s Citizens’ Advice Bureau handed out a food bank voucher to an undercover Mail on Sunday reporter entitling him to a generous three days’ worth of shopping –without even asking for any identification.

Our reporter Ross Slater, pictured, arrived at the CAB office near the city’s railway station to enquire about food vouchers. After filling out a form giving  his name, address, date of birth, phone number and the reason for the visit, the reporter was told to wait for an assessor to interview him.

The woman, called Katherine, who was in her 60s, asked our reporter a series of questions about why the food bank vouchers were needed.

He explained he had been unemployed for a  few months and had been caught out by higher than expected winter fuel bills and was strapped for cash and food. He added that his wife had left her job and was not earning and that they had two children to care for. After asking for details of how much Jobseekers’ Allowance was received, the assessor’s questions turned to the dietary requirements of the reporter and his family.

Katherine asked our man  to wait while she found out which food bank would be able to help him and then returned with an official voucher signed by the centre’s manager  Sarah Webber.

From there the reporter  was sent to the Trussell  Trust-run food bank at St Philip’s Church in Bulwell, Nottingham, where he presented the voucher to  one of several helpers.

Within minutes he was given with four shopping bags bursting with essentials – about £40 worth of groceries.

These included basics such as bread, sugar and pasta, as well as less essential items such chocolate pudding.

After inviting the reporter  to help himself to the soap, toothpaste and hot dog rolls they had spare, the volunteers wished him a Happy Easter and he staggered out of the church with his bags. He later returned the goods.

Last night the Trussell Trust said any distributor found to be providing vouchers to people not in genuine need would receive extra training.

He said one woman who attended Friday’s session had visited at least nine times in just four months, receiving food each time. He added: ‘It’s got to the point where I recognised names because you see them so frequently.’ The volunteer also said he suspected that several people, possibly other family members, had been collecting vouchers under the woman’s name.

The Trussell Trust, which was set up in 1997, oversees more than 400 of Britain’s estimated 1,000 food banks. It works with local churches to run many of them.

The charity was set up by former Army serviceman Paddy Henderson  and his wife.

A female volunteer showed a reporter a list of people who had claimed more than three food parcels, but she said that they would be unlikely to be refused items if they visited again. 

In another case, a man was given a food parcel after turning up without a  voucher – only a form the Jobcentre. He was handed the food despite a female volunteer earlier saying: ‘We’re not supposed to give it out.’

Nigel Baxter, lead organiser at Bestwood and Bulwell food bank in Deep Valley, Nottinghamshire, said: ‘Sometimes you get professional people on £60,000 salaries dropping in.

‘They have just been made redundant and feel embarrassed to be here. They still have the trappings of a good job, like Sky TV and iPhones, which are under contract, but they can’t afford to eat.’ Another volunteer revealed: ‘Some people just hoover up everything and even complain that the product is a cheap one and not the brand they want.’

Senior Tory MP Brian Binley welcomed this paper’s investigation, saying he had ‘always been very suspicious’ of the level of abuse in some food banks.

He said: ‘There are also a lot of dishonest people who will cadge their way into situations.

‘Food banks are run by very kind people. They do not understand that there are some people who will take advantage.’

Last night Tory MP Nigel Mills, a member of the Work and Pensions Select Committee, said: ‘If somebody is playing the system that’s clearly an abuse of what that charity is trying to do.’

Last night the Trussell Trust said it would investigate allegations of abuse, adding: ‘There is no evidence to suggest that awareness of the food banks is driving an increase in visitors, rather that food bank use is meeting a real and growing need.’
