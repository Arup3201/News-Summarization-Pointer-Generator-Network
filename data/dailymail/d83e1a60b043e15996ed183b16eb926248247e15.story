Legend has it that it partly provided the inspiration for J R R Tolkien's second book in the much-loved Lord of The Rings trilogy The Two Towers.

But an iconic yet dilapidated Birmingham landmark could be given a new lease of life after a charity with a Tolkien fanatic at the helm bought the empty building for £1.

Midlands homelessness charity Trident Reach The People snapped up the historic Grade II listed building in the hope of raising £1million to turn it into a centre for young artists and a venue for art exhibitions.

The tower, which is even said to perilously sway in strong winds, is thought to have provided inspiration for the tower of Orthanc, which featured in Tolkien's 1954 follow up to The Fellowship of The RIng.

Nearby Edgbaston Waterworks is said to have inspired the other tower.

Trident Reach the People now hope that the tower will provide inspiration for a new generation, and are hoping to start transforming it into a valuable resource in a deprived area of Edgbaston within the next 18 months.

Trident's Ben Bradley told the MailOnline: 'The reason we got involved is because it is in a area of high social deprivation.

'It's a deprived area, so the project will not only provide volunteering opportunities, but it will also allow us to provide support services for residents.

'It's not just a case of the building being used now and again, it will be in constant use.'

The charity originally became associated with the tower when it was looked after by a trust fund. But the trust fund became no longer viable and the charity stepped in to snap up Perrott's Folly for just £1.

The charity now hopes to raise the money through donations and a 'sponsor a brick' scheme, as well as by applying for grants.

Perrott's Folly, a 96 ft seven storey high brick tower, currently has one floor missing and is in a poor state of repair.

Despite its decaying state, the tower is still used, recently hosting a homeless art exhibition, and  a resident artist Lizzy Jordan has already been appointed.

But the charity hope that the money will enable it to fulfill its dream of turning the top and bottom floors into exhibition space showing off the best of local heritage and the obvious connection with Tolkien, with the rest of the building playing host to art exhibitions and workshops.

The land surrounding the 18th century tower will also be developed, the hope is to turn it into a mix of cinema and gallery space.

The tower is said to have provided the inspiration for Tolkien's Orthanc tower which formed part of Isengard one of the three fortresses of Gondor.

Isengard, which was built around the tower, was Saruman's base of operations in the War of the Ring.

Scores of Lord of the Rings fans already visit the tower each year as part of the Tolkien Trail, an unofficial route established by diehard fans of the fantasy series.

Almost as interesting as its link to Tolkien is the history of Perrott's Folly itself. It was built in the centre of a magnificent medieval hunting park by eccentric landowner John Perrott in 1758.

Fortress: The Orthanc tower formed part of Isengard one of the three fortresses of Gondor

Some have suggested that he built the tower to keep watch on his wife when he suspected her of having an affair with a gamekeeper, others say that it was a vantage point from which to look out at his wife's grave after she died.

In 1884, glass maker and metereologist Abraham Follett Osler began using the tower for weather observation and it became the Edgbaston Observatory.

The University of Birmingham began using the building as an observatory until 1979.

In 1984 the Perrott’s Folly Company was formed to renovate the tower and secured grants from English Heritage and Birmingham City Council.

The company worked with Birmingham Conservation Trust to carry out emergency repair work in 2005 to stabilise the structure and save it from collapse.

J R R Tolkien's family moved from the Midlands to South Africa before the author was born so that his father Arthur, a bank clerk, could better himself.

Tolkien was born in Bloemfontein in 1892, but the family moved back to the Midlands in 1896 after his father died.

They originally moved to the village of Sarehole which had not yet been swallowed up by Birmingham at the time. It is thought that the village provided much of the inspiration for Hobbiton and the Shire

It is thought that Sarehole Mill provided the inspiration for the mill that features in The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings.

He later lived in Sterling Road in the Edgbaston area just yards from the Edgbaston Waterworks and Perrott's Folley which are said to have inspired the Two Towers in the second book of his Lord of the Rings trilogy.

Tolkien is believed to have passed them every day on the journey to school.

His time living in the Moseley area as a child is also thought to have been the source of inspiration for some of the settings in both the Hobbit and the Lord of the RIngs.

Tolkien eventually moved away from Birmingham when he went to study at Exeter College in Oxford. He studied classics before switching to English Language and Literature, gaining a first class degree.

He fought in the Lancashire Fusiliers in the First World War contracting trench fever and spending some time in hospital in Birmingham.

The author spent some time working on the New English Dictionary project for a short while but eventually went back into academia, working at Leeds University and then going back to Oxford where he struck up a friendship with Narnia author CS Lewis.

He only began writing to amuse his four children but after The Hobbit was published in 1937 his work was in demand and he decided to write more.

Tolkien died on September 2 1973.
