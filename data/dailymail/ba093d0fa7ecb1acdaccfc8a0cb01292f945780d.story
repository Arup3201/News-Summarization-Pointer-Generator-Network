No sooner has Mario Balotelli set foot on Brazilian soil than Italy's volatile striker is playing down England’s World Cup hopes and talking up his dreams of becoming the best player on the planet.

Balotelli was not about to let the small matter of a draw with Luxemburg — the latest in a dismal run of results for Italy — disrupt his plans for world domination as he looked ahead to the eagerly anticipated Group D opener with Roy Hodgson’s side in Manaus on Saturday.

As wildcards go, they do not come much wilder than Balotelli but the Italians are relying on their unpredictable front man hitting top form, just as he did in Euro 2012 when he finished joint leading scorer with three goals.

Typically, the AC Milan star is not lacking in confidence.

‘People will always want to talk about Mario, people always want to write about Mario, but I am used to that,’ said Balotelli. ‘Now is the time for me to do my talking, but I want to do my talking on the field. I still have dreams of being the best player in the world, and legends are made at the World Cup.

‘I totally believe that Italy can win the World Cup. I am realistic and know that maybe there are one or two teams who are operating at a level higher than us — but one of them are definitely not England.

‘I’m convinced that we can beat anybody. With the quality and experience we have, Italy are a team any nation should fear playing.’

Balotelli’s claims do not quite stack up on current form. Cesare Prandelli’s side have failed to win any of their last seven games, including draws with Armenia, Nigeria, Denmark and Republic of Ireland before Wednesday’s embarrassing flop, the 1-1 draw with Luxembourg, in Perugia.

The Italians landed in Rio on Friday and will play their final warm-up game against Brazilian club Fluminense on Sunday.

Prandelli insists there is nothing to worry about but he is unsure of his best formation, never mind starting line-up, with less than a week to go before the England game.

However, the four-time World Cup winners are notoriously off-colour before major tournaments and Hodgson and his players will not need reminding about their painful European Championship defeat by Italy in Kiev two years ago.

Balotelli beat his former Manchester City team-mate Joe Hart in a penalty shootout and the 23-year-old is ready to be equally ruthless as the two men prepare to meet again in his first World Cup.

‘I am not even thinking that when we play England that I will be playing against former team-mates,’ he added. ‘When the game is over we will share a hug — but until the final whistle there can be no friendships.’

That shootout will always be remembered for Andrea Pirlo’s audacious chipped effort past Hart on a night when the Juventus playmaker was simply outstanding.

The bad news for England is that, even at 35, Pirlo remains at the top of his game as he attempts to end his international career by winning the World Cup for a second time.

‘The feeling to represent your country in a World Cup is amazing, and the feeling when you win one is indescribable,’ said Pirlo. ‘I have already been fortunate enough to win the World Cup, and just maybe I can win one more.’

The Italians experienced the heat of Brazil in last summer’s Confederations Cup, even though it will not compare to the stifling humidity of northernmost Manaus.

During a training camp in Florence last week, Prandelli had his players training in a shed specially designed to replicate the oppressive conditions and Pirlo believes the European teams will have just as good a chance as their South American rivals.

‘I think a lot is being made about a European team never winning the World Cup in South America,’ he added. ‘I understand why Brazil are favourites, but with the quality of some of the European teams it is crazy to think it can’t happen.

‘You can’t just dismiss the heat. We played in the Confederations Cup last year and it does get very intense, but all the coaching staff and trainers will be doing everything they can to help the players combat it.’

Pirlo was rather more respectful of England than Balotelli, and, in particular, captain Steven Gerrard as the two veteran midfielders go head to head once again.

He said: ‘Steven Gerrard is one of the great central midfield players of the generation, maybe the greatest.

‘Of course, as you get older you have to adapt your game, but he has proved he has got the intelligence to do that. When he finally decides to retire I think he will be put in the same class as players like Zidane and Scholes.’
