Real life castaway Jose Salvador Alvarenga spent five days with the rotting corpse of his tragic shipmate, it emerged Sunday as the harrowing details of his colleagueâ€™s last moments were finally revealed.

Ezequiel Cordoba's father Nicolas Cordoba, 47, shed light on the tragic voyage after he was contacted by a distraught Mr Alvarenga, who emotionally apologized for what happened to his son.

As he fought back tears, Mr Cordoba said his heroic son instructed Mr Alvarenga to tell his mother that he 'loved her with all his heart' just seconds before he passed away.

The 25-year-old fishermen, who knew he was going to die, is also said to have begged Mr Alvarenga to toss his dead body over board to stop his friend from getting ill from his rotting flesh.

But Mr Alvarenga, who was left distraught at losing his shipmate, was desperate to give the young sailor 'a proper burial' and hoped that he would be rescued before the body decomposed.

However, after five days lying next to his companion's rotting corpse he eventually tossed him into the Pacific Ocean as the putrid smell from his flesh became too much to bear.

Speaking exclusively from his home in Cuidad Juarez, in northern Mexico, Mr Cordoba said that when he heard the horrific details of what happened to his son he had a nervous break down and was hospitalized for a day.

The father of seven, who works in a car factory, said: 'I finally spoke to Jose on Thursday, he told me he was very sorry for what happened to my son.

'It was good to hear that my son was so brave as he faced death. But the details of what happened were very hard to hear. They caused me to become physically sick.

'He told me that Ezequiel became ill after four months at sea as his body struggled to cope with the diet of raw fish and turtle blood.

'He was vomiting and could not keep anything down, he must have developed a bad sickness. My son's body could no longer tolerate any of what they had to eat.

'Jose told me that my son knew he was
 going to die and instructed him to throw his body over board so his 
rotting flesh would not make him ill.

'But
 Jose, who was very sad because of his death, said he could not bring 
himself to do it, as he wanted to give him a proper burial.

'He said after five days the smell became horrific as my son's body decomposed and he eventually threw the body into the sea.

'Jose said that my son's dying words where "tell my mother and family I love them with all my heart."

'This was the hardest conversation I have had but I needed to hear what had happened to my son.'

Mr Alvarenga also said that he was desperate to come back to Mexico to meet Ezequiel's parents so he could talk to them face to face and explain what happened to their son.

The Salvadorian fisherman, who is known locally as La Chancha, now wants the boss from his fishing company to compensate him and Ezequiel's family for what happened.

Mr Alvarenga, who had lived a destitute existence as an impoverished fisherman, said he should be given compensation by his fishing company Camaroneros De La Costa because he can longer work due to his 'physical condition.'

Mr Alvarenga contacted Mr Cordoba on 
Thursday night after the pair were put in contact by a delegate from the
 Mexican foreign office, who was with the castaway in the Marshal 
Islands.

Mr
 Cordoba, who is now receiving treatment to cope with his bereavement, 
added: 'At first I did not fully believe the story because my son knows 
how to handle himself out at sea.

'But
 after talking to Jose I believe his story. He too was very sad about 
what happened to Ezequiel and has even said he will try to get his 
fishing company to give money to our family.

'He
 wants to honor the dying wishes of my son and help look after his 
mother. I do believe he is a good man but I must see him face to face 
and hear the story.

'He said he wants to get compensation from his boss for what happened to him and he also wants the fishing company to give money to Ezequiel's mother so she can be properly looked after.

'He wants to come here to see us, I just hope the Mexican authorities will allow him to.

'But even if they don't we are prepared to go to El Salvador to talk to him.'

Mr Cordoba left Ezequiel's mother Rosella, who he had five boys with, over ten years ago and moved to northern Mexico.

He now lives in Ciudad Juarez, which 
is a notoriously violent city on the boarder with El Paso, United 
States, with a long-term partner, who he has had two girls with.

Ezequiel
 grew up with four brothers in the poor fishing village of El Fortin, 
Chiapas, with his mother Rosella and his stepfather.

Mr Alvarenga and Ezequiel set sail from the small fishing village of Costa Azul, also in the Chiapas, in late 2012.

But strong northerly winds forced to the pair off course and they were left helplessly adrift at sea.

After four months at sea Ezequiel sadly died while later Mr Alvarenga spent another 11 months in their small fishing boat before washing up on the Marshall Islands, in the Pacific Ocean, 6,000 miles from where he originally set sail.

A contemplative Mr Cordoba added: 'What happened to both of them is horrible and truly remarkable.

'Jose told me he feels an obligation to our family to see us in person to explain everything.

'Of course I still have some questions about what happened but I am glad that Jose survived because this way I can find out the complete truth.

'If they both died I would never have known what happened and the unknown can be much harder to deal with.'

Mr Alvarenga had been receiving medical treatment for severe dehydration in the Marshall Islands but was finally released from hospital on Saturday, however, doctors have said he is still not fit enough to travel.

It is still unclear whether Mr Alvarenga, who lived between the poor fishing towns of Costa Azul and Paredon in Chiapas, which is the poorest state in Mexico, will be allowed to return to his adopted country.
