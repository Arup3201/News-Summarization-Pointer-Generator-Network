Like something ripped from the headlines that made them rich, the son to the National Enquirer heiress has come out swinging in feud over family fortune with a television interview in which he accuses his mother of trying to 'villianize' him and kidnap his son.

Paul Pope claims his Palm Beach, Florida socialite mother is squandering their millions and 'loves to get whatever type of attention she can get.'

'She's sued me like five times in 24 years' said 45-year-old Pope. 'She's an actress, and she loves the limelight.'

In the interview with Good Morning America, Pope also claimed it was his 79-year-old mother Lois who started their current feud some months ago.

'We were getting along fine,' Pope said in the interview Thursday, 'then she mentioned, in early January, getting this kidnap and ransom policy on my son.'

Pope believes the suggestion was a veiled threat against her grandchild.

Mrs. Pope says her son asked her for the 
insurance - adding that it is nothing more than her other children and 
grandchildren already carry.

Meanwhile, Lois Pope filed a 
restraining order last week alleging that her son began stalking her
after she refused to give him all the money he demands.

In documents filed by Lois Pope in a Palm Beach court last week, she says her son maintains 'an excessive and extravagant lifestyle, but has never had meaningful employment.'

After National Enquirer founder Generoso Pope died in 1989, Lois received $200 million, while Paul Pope inherited $20 million.

The rest of the $400 million the tabloid sold for was divided among Mr Pope's four other siblings.

Mrs. Pope also claims her son has repeatedly asked her for money, even after she gave him $8 million and a yacht in recent years.

'This is devastating to me. I am positively distraught. I have tried to help him so many times. He is doing this because he runs out of money and he needs my help again. It’s so abusive. None of this is true,' she told the New York Post.

Mrs. Pope is a well-known philanthropist
who has donated tens of millions to the University of Miami, veterans 
groups and humanitarian charities.

'I run a foundation and I try to help
people, and he is trying to destroy my name. I feel sorry for him for 
saying such things about his mother. He wants to blacken my name. I have
never stolen from anyone - I give, I never take.'

Mr.
Pope wrote an as-yet-unpublished book called 'Confessions of a Rich Kid
from Hell.' He has three children, all by women who he is not married 
to. And he has been publicly accused of domestic abuse.

Fearful: Lois Pope says her son constantly harasses her for money and she's petitioned for a restraining order

Meanwhile, Lois Pope says her son has been layabout in search of money for years:

Petitioned for a restraining order accusing her son of 'stalking' her for money

Says she's given him millions and he's the one with the lavish lifestyle

Claims he's used his tabloid connections to spread lies about her in the media

The restraining order is just the latest salvo in a long-running legal war between mother and son.

Mr Pope claims the trouble began in 1988 after the sale of the tabloid, which he says he wanted to keep in the family and run himself.

Mrs Pope says her son spends lavishly and blew through his $20 million by 2008 and she wrote him a check for $12 million more.

Last year, she says she gave him an addition $4 million.

'He wanted $20 million,' she said, according to the Miami Herald.

She claims that his constant requests for more money have made her fearful for her safety.

Mr Pope, however, claims his own safety is in danger and his mother is wasting her fortune.

Mr Pope operates a website titled Where's the Money Lois? that accuses his mother of fraud and of wasting the family's inheritance.

He claims she purchased two $22 million Cessna Citation X private jets - including one just to ferry her 18 dogs around the country.

Other alleged excesses include $2 million international vacations and $250,000 gifts to her nieces and nephews. Unfortunately your browser does not support IFrames.
