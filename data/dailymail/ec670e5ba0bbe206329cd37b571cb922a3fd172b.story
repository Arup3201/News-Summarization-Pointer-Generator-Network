Leandra Medine has become an online celebrity thanks to her blog The Man Repeller, which documents her love of fashion-forward looks that the opposite sex just doesn't get.

But it seems there is one man who would not be put off by her sartorial confidence: UBS financier Abie Cohen.

A photo from the couple's June wedding in the latest issue of Town & Country, officially introduces Mr Cohen, 27, for the very first time.

In an accompanying interview, Ms Medine, 23, describes their six-year courtship, from how they met at a Halloween party while she was still at high school and he was a student at NYU.

She tells the magazine: 'Facebook was 
like our own personal JDate.

'He saw a photo of me in an album of a 
friend of mine whom he was dating, and he friended me.'

After a series of messages and a lunch date, they started dating, but broke up a year later, after which they saw each other on-and-off for the next three years.

A turning point was when Mr Cohen saw Ms Medine with another man.

She recalled: 'He texted me, "That physically hurt." We got back together the next day.'

The blogger announced her engagement last December on her website - news that came as a surprise to many fans who had no idea that she even had a boyfriend.

The wedding itself took place seven months later, a traditional Jewish ceremony in front of 450 guests at New York's St Regis hotel.

Ms Medine, who wore a Marchesa gown, admitted:Â  'Abie was expecting me to go a lot crazier, but I think I kept it very simple.'

She
 accessorised the dress with a custom-made Rebecca Minkoff leather 
jacket, a headdress of peonies and lilies, and embellished platform 
Superga sneakers.

Ms Medine, who attracts 50,000 
viewers a day to her blog, has appeared on E!'s Fashion Police with Joan
 Rivers, and will launch a limited-edition fashion line with PJK next 
spring.

Fashion-forward: Ms Medine explains the origins of the name 'Man Repeller' on her blog

Since signing with top talent agency CAA this summer, she has revealed she is writing a book to be published next year.

Explaining the concept behind the name of her blog, she has said: 'Good fashion is about pleasing women, not men, so as it happens, the trends that we love, men hate. And that is fantastic.'
