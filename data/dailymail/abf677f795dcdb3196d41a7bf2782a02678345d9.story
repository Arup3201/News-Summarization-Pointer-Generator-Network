Two men from Adelaide have performed an amazing road-site emergency Cesarean section to save a tiny baby wombat from the pouch of it's dead mother.

Friends Dmrenzo Kotze, 21, and Chris Dimasi, 20, of Craigmore, in South Australia, discovered the deceased wombat in the middle of the road as they were driving through the Riverland region of Blanchetown on Saturday.

The pair noticed small movements near the stomach of the wombat when they went to move it off the driving track, and quickly located a knife to rescue the small creature they believed to be inside.

 The baby only weighed 247 grams and was believed to be three months old

'We could kind of see something moving inside ... we thought we could see what we could do because (we thought) it could be a baby,' Mr Kotze told Perth Now.

Mr Dimasi, who works in an abattoir, began to cut open the stomach of the wombat while Mr Kotze filmed the extraordinary procedure.

The footage shows the outer layer of fur and skin being cut away by Mr Dimasi, who uses a series of clean cuts to carefully open the wombat until they can see the joey inside.

After piercing the pouch, the baby wombat slides out onto the dirt and rolls around before being helped to its feet by Mr Dimasi.

'We wrapped it up and took it to my house and gave it a wash to try and get as much dirt and everything off it,' said Mr Kotze.

The young men took the tiny wombat, who weighs just 247 grams, to local members of Fauna South Australia, Jane and Phil Budich, of Blanchetown.

Ms Budich said that baby wombats generally weigh about three kilograms when they are birthed from the pouch, and so the little creature will need to put on a significant amount of weight before it can be released into the wild.

Ms Budich will be caring for wombat until that time, bottle feeding it every four hours and keeping it under a heat pad.

The baby wombat has been named Whisper by Ms Budich, although Mr Kotze and Mr Dimasi said they had named him Jeffrey.

Ms Budich has been caring for animals around South Australia for 15 years and has confirmed that the joey is a little boy.

Ms Budich commended the pair for their quick thinking and said that Whisper would have been dead within a day if they had not rescued it.

'He's doing well, he's drinking bottles and has a beautiful little personality,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'Wombats are battlers but you have to treat them with love. He's so tiny, he's the size of a pork sausage.'

Ms Budich is a representative for Fauna SA, which has animal carers all around the state. 

'If anyone comes across a baby wombat or kangaroo that has been stunned or injured they can call a fauna rescue service. Don't take the baby out of the pouch because they hold onto the mothers teat and their jaws can break for life,' Ms Budich said.

'The boys didn't know what they were doing but they did a good job. Fauna in Australia are so neglected so it's nice seeing people looking after animals,' she said. 

'I would like to say Chris and myself are now proud fathers of 3 month old wombat Jeffery,' Mr Kotze posted on his Facebook page.

He implored people to move animals off the road they are hit, and to make sure they are not suffering.
