Andy Murray’s brother followed in his footsteps yesterday as he crashed out of Wimbledon in the mixed doubles quarter-finals.

Jamie Murray had said he hoped to give his family someone to cheer for after his younger brother’s shock defeat to Grigor Dimitrov.

But he and Australian partner Casey Dellacqua went out in three sets after a battling performance to leave their mother, Judy Murray, without a son to watch in the finals weekend.

Out: Jamie Murray and Casey Dellacqua were beaten by Max Mirnyi and Chan Hao-ching, ending the Murrays' run in Wimbledon

Former mixed doubles Wimbledon champion 
Jamie, 28, picked up £11,500 for reaching the last eight of the 
competition – compared to the £226,000 his brother pocketed for going 
out in the same stage of the men’s singles.

All-British pair Neal 
Skupski and Naomi Broady also went out of the mixed doubles 
quarter-finals after losing to Pakistan’s Aisam Qureshi and Russian Vera
 Dushevina.

And Britain’s last hope of junior singles success at 
Wimbledon was also extinguished as Josh Sapwell lost in the 
quarter-finals of the boys’ event.

The 18-year-old from Flitwick, 
Bedfordshire, lost in straight sets to French youngster Johan Sebastien 
Tatlot on Court 18.

Better on the day: The pair were beaten 6-2 3-6 6-3 in the quarter-final clash
