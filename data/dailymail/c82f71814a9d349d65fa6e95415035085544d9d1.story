Hit four times: Catherine Bury, 56, had locked herself in the bathroom but her attacker burst through and shot her

Three generations of a British  family were shot by their gardener after a pool party at their Turkish holiday home.

Anne Bury, who was celebrating her 56th birthday, was killed. Her son Alex, 23, and mother Cecilia, 87, were taken to hospital with serious injuries.

Their attacker had been arrested less than 48 hours before for apparently making death threats against the family.

But he was released, and shortly afterwards arrived at the luxury villa in the picturesque coastal resort of Dalyan armed with a pump-action shotgun.

The shootings happened in the early hours of Monday, after a party to mark Miss Bury’s birthday.

The 46-year-old gunman, named by locals as Turkish gardener and handyman Velli Acar, appears to have targeted the family in some kind of revenge attack.

He blasted Mrs Bury in the back and shot her grandson in the leg. Miss Bury fled in  terror up three flights of stairs and bolted herself in her bathroom. But Acar blasted the lock and reportedly shot her four times at point-blank range as she cowered on the tiled floor. She died at the scene.

Her son and widowed mother were taken by ambulance to separate hospitals.

Mrs Bury was later discharged and Alex was said to be in a ‘stable’ condition after undergoing successful surgery to repair a damaged artery in his leg.

Locals in Dalyan claimed that Miss Bury may have been in a relationship with Acar and the killing was probably a crime of passion.

The suspect, named locally as Velli Acar, is taken into custody by the security forces today

Neighbour Ozman Tugcu said: ‘I’d seen 
them out together occasionally and thought they were a couple. But they 
were both quiet and kept themselves to themselves.’

But
another neighbour said the row was over money, and Acar had been 
accused of pocketing cash intended for other tradesmen for work at the 
villa.

Police have refused to comment on the motive for the shooting.

Mr
Tugcu described the British family as ‘quiet and respectable people’. 
He said he was alerted to the shooting by the arrival of police. 

Alex Bury planned to become a doctor, according the family's neighbours in north Allerton

‘I
was horrified to see the elderly lady brought out of the house,’ he 
said. ‘She was covered in blood. I was sure she was dead and am 
astonished she survived. It’s a really dreadful thing to happen.’

 The gunman later gave himself up to police and was remanded in  custody yesterday ahead of a formal court appearance.

Miss Bury and her family had been going to stay in their villa in the tiny fishing village for six years.

Acar,
described as a heavy drinker, had been reported to police over alleged 
death threats and was arrested on Saturday. He was held overnight for 
questioning and released the following day.

Locals said the suspect also owned a boat and ran trips for tourists in the resort.

One
resident said he would regularly drink a bottle of a strong local wine.
‘Velli was a quiet man but we think he had an alcohol problem,’ he 
said. The Bury family had  decorated their villa with bunting and 
balloons for the birthday party by the pool on Sunday.

Yesterday blood smears could be seen on the marble floors beneath the decorations.

Friends and neighbours at home in Britain paid tribute to the dead woman and expressed their shock.

Miss Bury, a former nurse from North Yorkshire, worked as a risk manager for a Saudi-based medical services company.

Neighbour Stephen Garbut said the family are 'the nicest people you could ever wish to meet'. Pictured is the Bury family's UK home in Northallerton, North Yorkshire

She had a masters degree in law and a degree in midwifery.

Mr Bury, her only child, had graduated from university and was working in medical research while planning to train as a doctor.

Miss
Bury lived in a bungalow in Swainby, North Yorkshire, but spent 
prolonged periods abroad working in Saudi Arabia and visiting her 
holiday home in Turkey. Neighbour Steve Garbutt, 72, said: ‘They were a 
lovely family and this has come as a terrible shock.

‘You
just don’t expect anything like this to happen. [She] was an excellent 
neighbour and was always friendly when you spoke to her.

‘I
never ever heard a bad word, or a cross word or anything like that from
any of them. How on earth they got into this situation I cannot 
imagine.’

Local resident 
Irene Cousans, 60, added: ‘They never caused any  trouble and were 
always very friendly. I think everyone in the  village is in shock. I 
don’t understand how this has happened.

‘Anne’s mum used to visit a lot too and she was just as lovely as her daughter and grandson.’

A Foreign Office spokesman  said: ‘We are providing consular assistance to the family at this  difficult time.’
