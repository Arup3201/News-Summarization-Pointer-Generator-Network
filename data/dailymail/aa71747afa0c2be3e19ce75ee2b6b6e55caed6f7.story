Oscar-winning actress Penelope Cruz has added another string to her bow by turning writer and director for a promotional video for her new underwear range with Agent Provocateur.

The 39-year-old, who gave birth to her second child this month, designed the L'Agent collection with her younger sister, Monica, 36.

While fans of the Spanish actress may be disappointed she doesn't make an appearance in the video herself, she has assembled a host of attractive models to take her place showcasing the lingerie.

Quest: 'L'Agent' searches the party for Irina, right

Irina recently starred in an Agent Provocateur video directed by Penelope Cruz

Star of the steamy show is Russian model, Irina Shayk, who is dating footballer Cristiano Ronaldo. In the video, she becomes the object of affection for actor Miguel Angel Silvestre, who pursues her at a party full of scantily-clad women and is rewarded with a lap dance.

Migeul plays the part of 'L'Agent' who is able to see the women at the party in their underwear when he puts on his sunglasses.

But of course, it's all too good to be true and he is woken from his dance with Irina by his boss - played by Penelope's Oscar winning husband, Javier Bardem.

In a behind the scenes video of the racy shoot, Penelope reveals her creative intentions.

She said: 'It's important to send the message that this is for everybody. I can find beauty in so many different types of women. I didn't just want to show the beautiful bodies of the models, I wanted to tell a story.'

Miguel said he was delighted when he was asked to star in the video and work with Penelope and Javier - as well as a host of beautiful, half-naked women.

He said: 'It was a gift when Penelope called me as I really like the way she 
acts. When she told me she was going to direct I thought she would do 
something very special.'

He added that it wasn't easy to keep his cool when he was working with Irina, which at times led to him dissolving into giggles.

Guest star: Javier makes a cameo appearance at the end of the video

Job satisfaction: The trio on set look at a play back of their work

He said: 'I was surrounded by women in their underwear all day... I really had to concentrate.. this job is something I'm never going to forget!'

While Penelope chose to stay behind the camera, her co-designer sister does have a cameo and at the time was heavily pregnant (she has since given birth to her daughter).

Penelope said: 'I got my sister a few days before she gave birth and I thought she wasn't going to make it but she came and looked beautiful.'

Flirty and fun: The range includes the boldly-coloured satin Marisela, left, while the Monica uses hot pink to reflect her playful spirit

New looks: The sisters say the collection, including the Karmen, left, and Clementina are wearable and flattering

Garments in their debut lingerie range are named after Spanish girls with the Clementina to the Alyce, and of course, the Penelope and Mónica pieces.

The sisters said they have wanted to create wearable styles that are flattering and sexy.

The range includes bras, briefs, suspenders and baby doll dresses made using satin, tulle and lace.

While some items come in a classic black and neutral shades, others use bold, vibrant shades such as hot pink and lime green.

The collection will go on sale at stockists including Net-A-Porter.com, Selfridges, House of Fraser and John Lewis.
