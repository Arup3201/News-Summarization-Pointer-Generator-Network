Prime Minister Tony Abbott has foreshadowed a crackdown on abuse of welfare by terror supporters, following revelations that most home grown extremists were receiving welfare payments before fleeing to fight in the middle east.

He said up to November, 55 of 57 Australians who had travelled to the Middle East to join the Islamist death cult had been on welfare, and that wasn't good enough. 

The announcement comes as a 23-year-old university student has emerged as the first known recruit from Western Australia to flee the country to join terrorist group Islamic State.

 'If you are fit enough to go overseas to fight for a terrorist organisation, surely you should not be abusing the welfare system back in Australia,' he told reporters in Darwin on Saturday.

Mr Abbott will deliver his long-awaited national security statement on Monday, detailing what the government is doing to ensure Australians were safe abroad and at home. He said he would address numerous issues.

'One of them ... is the fact that for too long we have given people who don't have this country's interests at heart the benefit of the doubt,' he said.

One of those would appear to be Man Haron Monis, the Iranian-born asylum seeker and perpetrator of the Sydney Martin Place siege.

Monis, who had taken 18 people hostage, was shot dead when police stormed the cafe, ending the crisis that shocked Australia and made headlines worldwide. Two hostages died. 

Khaled Sharrouf is among 55 home-grown terrorists who received welfare payments after joining ISIS

Previously, Mr Abbott has said Monis had taken advantage of the Australian system and at every step of the way, he was given the benefit of the doubt.

A joint NSW and commonwealth report on dealings with Monis before the siege is tipped to be released on Sunday, ahead of Mr Abbott's security statement.

A media report says that's likely to result in a tougher stance on immigration requirements. 

Another high profile extremist among the 55 to be receiving welfare  while fighting in the Middle East is Khaled Sharrouf.

Also in the spotlight is Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir which Attorney-General George Brandis said had for a long time been 'close to the edge'.

'We are concerned that Hizb ut-Tahrir is feeding a climate which makes it easier for terrorist recruiters to do their work,' he told ABC television on Friday.  

Hizb ut-Tahrir (Arabic for Party of Liberation) is an international Muslim organisation founded in 1953 with about 300 adherents in Australia. It advocates a single Islamic state, or caliphate, in the Middle East under Islamic law.

The group is banned in many Middle East countries and also in Russia, Turkey, Pakistan and Germany but not in Australia, the US or UK.  

Nearly all of the 'home-grown' terrorists who have left the country to join IS were on welfare payments when they fled

It's never explicitly advocated violence but it rejects democracy and is equivocal on condemning terrorist violence.

Senator Brandis said the government would do what needed to be done.

'In some circumstances monitoring and surveillance is the most efficacious tool, in some circumstances prohibition,' he said.

The news comes after 23-year-old Perth University student Muhammed Sheglabo flew to the Middle East after telling his parents that he was going away on a camping trip in January.  

His family contacted the police when they were not able to contact him, and were reportedly heartbroken when they were informed of his decision.  

Sheglabo, who migrated with his family from Libya in 2010, is believed to be fighting with Islamic State forces in Al-Furat province, near the Syria-Iraq border. 

The Prime Minister is set to announce strict new laws to prevent the reign of extremist groups in Australia.
