Football super league: media tycoon Rupert Murdoch is reported to be investigating the possibility of launching an international football club competition

Rupert Murdoch is considering plans to launch a summer football 'super league' featuring Europe’s top clubs to be played in cities from Shanghai to Los Angeles.

Leading Premier League clubs, likely to include Chelsea, Manchester United and Arsenal, would be invited to take part in the tournament, competing with sides including Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich.

The plan would see 16 teams take part in the competition, which would run for 10 years and start as early as 2015, during the close season period when teams usually go on tour and play exhibition matches.

According to the Guardian newspaper, matches would be aired on Sky and Mr Murdoch's other broadcaster's around the world.

The
82 year old media mogul, who announced he was splitting from his third 
wife Wendi Deng earlier this week, will complete the process of 
separating his 21st Century Fox company from the rest of his News 
Corporation publishing empire last this month.

He owns broadcaster’s in 
Italy, Germany, Asia and the US. Both Sky and News Corp declined to 
comment.

The Guardian quoted one source as saying the plan was 
akin to a ‘Formula One off football’ with cities from around the world 
bidding to host tournament matches.

Approaches had been made to a number of cities by executives from Mr 
Murdoch’s Fox International subsidiary to explore partnerships to host 
the exhibition style tournament matches but discussions are at an early 
stage.

‘One of the major issues is if it gets to the stage of 
trying to pull the empire together and paying what they think is a fair 
share,’ the Guardian quoted a second source as saying.

Over half 
of the clubs in the English Premiership are in foreign hands and five 
are owned by Americans including Manchester United, Liverpool and 
Arsenal.

The desire to create a global fan base among Premier 
League clubs has driven several to head abroad in the off season on extensive tours of the US and Asia.

Chelsea flew to the US to play
Manchester City almost immediately after the end of last season and head
to Thailand, Malaysia, India and the US again before the start of the 
new 2013-14 season in August.

Top teams: the top Premier League clubs would be invited to play European rivals in cities around the world

Top teams: fans from around the world would get the chance to see their club compete with other top teams rather than play against local opposition in exhibition matches

Many Premier League clubs are following in
the footsteps of Manchester United, which is the third richest football 
club in the world behind Barcelona and Real Madrid, thanks to a tapping 
into an overseas fanb ase and international sponsorship over the last two
decades.

Manchester United travel to Malaysisa, Japan and Hong Kong 
this summer, before returning home for the start of the new season.

This summer's
inaugural Guinness International Cup, which starts in July and features eight clubs among them 
Chelsea, Milan, Real Madrid and LA Galaxy is being considered a dry run 
for the more ambitious scheme.

The competition will see early rounds 
take place in Europe before finals which will take place in Miami in 
August.

Mr Murdoch has a history of trying to create new 
competitions in various sports. In the 1990sNews Corp created its own 
rugby super league in Australia forcing the sport’s international 
governing body to partner to create the National Rugby League 
competition.

Earlier this year it was reported BskyB and News Corp were interested in creating a new world series cycling competition.
