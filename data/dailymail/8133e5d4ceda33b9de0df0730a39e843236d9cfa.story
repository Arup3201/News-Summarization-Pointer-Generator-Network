Now is it time for Man United to sack Moyes?

Javier Hernandez appears to have taken a thinly-veiled dig at Robin van Persie.

The Manchester United striker criticised David Moyes' side in the wake of their dismal 2-0 defeat at Olympiacos.

And Hernandez posting a picture on Instagram claiming, 'Without your teammates you can't be somebody in football, always be thankful...'

Van Persie's future at Old Trafford is shrouded in mystery.

Even though it’s easy to see why he chose to let rip on Tuesday - the service to him was almost nonexistent - it won't serve to help his boss as they try and pick up the pieces of a rotten campaign.

Sportsmail can reveal that goalkeeper David de Gea completed more passes to Van Persie than all but two of United’s attacking personnel.

The
 Spanish keeper delivered two balls to his Dutch colleague, and that was
 one more than Michael Carrick, Ashley Young and Danny Welbeck managed.

Tom Cleverley and Shinji Kagawa, meanwhile, failed to make a single pass to Van Persie.

Following the Champions League humiliation the frustrated frontman gave an interview to Dutch TV channel NOS and made clear his opinions on why his form had dipped.

When asked whether he was allowed deep to collect the ball, Van Persie said: 'Our fellow players are sometimes occupying the spaces I want to play in.

'And when I see that, it makes it difficult for me to come to those spaces as well. So that forces me to adjust my runs, based on the position of my fellow players.

'And, unfortunately, they are often playing in my zones. I think that's a shame.'

The striker's best chance of the night came in the second half when he fired over the crossbar having fashioned a yard inside the area.

'I rushed that shot [to make it 2-1 late in the game]', Van Persie admitted.

'That's a shame because I don't get a lot of chances, so when you get one, you have to score.'

He also responded to criticism of Moyes, who has been under constant pressure during United's poor run of results in recent months.

Van Persie said: 'He's working hard at it and so are we. Sometimes we play well but not all the time. We don't have luck on our side. It's easy to point the finger at someone but I'm not like that. We have to do better ourselves.

'With all due respect, we should be able to defeat this team 2-0 or 3-0.'
