As Yorkshire gears up for the world's largest annual sporting event this weekend, the county's finest eateries have been busy bringing a touch of luxury to proceedings.

While thousands of eager spectators will be fighting for a spot to line the route, Yorkshire's poshest pubs, bars 
and hotels are laying on deals so fans can watch the event in 
comfort.

These luxury viewpoints - including five-star restaurants and a hot tub - are being billed as the poshest places to watch the British leg of the Tour De France.

A touch of luxury as the cyclists power past: Ashmount Hotel in Haworth is offering the chance to watch the Tour De France from a hot tub

Breakfast in style: The Ashmount Hotel in Haworth is one of a number of Yorkshire hotels focusing on the finest offerings of food and drink

Businesses are offering tiered seating, full lobster lunches and even a hot tub to punters who want to treat themselves.

The Bruce Arms in West Tanfield, North Yorkshire, is offering track-side seats for the Tour de France, complete with a £120 luxury lobster lunch.

'We didn't want to go down the hog-roast and burger route. We wanted to bring something upmarket and different,' said pub owner Hugh Carruthers.

'Within an hour of the route being announced a year ago, I had decided what I wanted to do - offer a luxury experience to people wanting to watch the race.'

While the pub is closed to those who haven't pre-booked, they're also laying on champagne and oysters for passers-by who are looking for a moment to remember.

The 3,500km race begins on Saturday when The Grand Depart will see nearly 200 cyclists set off from Leeds in an 190km slog to Harrogate.

Boutique hotel The Harrogate Brasserie lies just yards from Saturday's finish line. The 18-bedroom hotel has guests coming from as far afield as Belgium to watch the race, so they've laid on a first class package.

The sold-out spectacular will offer a Bucks Fizz brunch before the race arrives in Harrogate, followed by a glamorous jazz buffet dinner for 120 race revellers.

'It's a very special event which warrants something special to mark the race's arrival in Yorkshire,' said Owner Richard Finney.

'This is a one-off event and we've got one chance to get it right.'

Another establishment adding some sparkle to the event is Ashmount House Hotel in Haworth, West Yorkshire.

As the half-way point in Sunday's leg of the race, the historic home town of the Brontes will welcome the Tour de France around lunchtime.

Ashmount House Hotel is offering spectators the chance to soak up the Tour de France experience from their very own hot tub, with views of the rolling Yorkshire countryside. For £245 a-night, guests will stay in five-star luxurious surroundings, just a three-minute walk from the track.

Ray Capeling, owner of the hotel, said: 'We're offering people the chance to enjoy the Tour De France in a romantic setting, with a unique view of Haworth. We're very close to the heart of the action and are bringing a French theme into the hotel to celebrate the Tour de France with a special menu right on the doorstep.'

Back in Harrogate, Hotel du Vin is getting in the spirit by offering £25 cocktails to Tour tag-alongs, who can watch the race from the hotel's veranda.

The luxury hotel chain has teamed up with Monkey Shoulder, Hendrick's and Reyka Vodka to create the boozy beverages, which will be served with a hefty BBQ.

Meanwhile, award-winning restaurant Martha and Vincent in Ilkley, West Yorkshire, has gone the extra mile by enlisting the help of a nearby church to ensure their diners will get a track-side view of the cyclists, served up with a seven-course meal.

The All Saints Church in Ilkley, West Yorkshire, has given up space for 36 lucky guests, who will watch the race arrive from the reserved seats before tucking into a £115 feast.

The meal includes canapes on arrival, two starters, a duo of main courses and two desserts, served with a specially selected wine.

Dan Constantin, manager of Martha and Vincent, said: 'We have created a very special menu for this very special event and we will have French music and entertainment to create a really authentic atmosphere.

'We want our diners to be able to really take in the Tour de France as we are very lucky to be on the route so we have secured them exclusive seating for the moment the race comes to Ilkley.

'As a thank you to the church for allowing us to use the spot, we are donating £30 from each ticket to them as a donation to the church's restoration.

'We are expecting over 1,000 people to visit Ilkley for the event so we're expecting it to be an amazing day.'

Finally, perhaps one of Yorkshire's most iconic cafes will make an appearance on more than one occasion during the Tour de France.
