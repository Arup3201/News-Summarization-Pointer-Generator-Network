When astronomers first started taking ultraviolet images of Venus, they were somewhat baffled by a mysterious ‘Y’ shape that covered the entire planet.

But now researchers say they have an answer - high intensity winds are distorting a ‘wave’ of clouds to produce a stretched effect.

The discovery could also reveal how similar processes take place on other slow-rotating bodies in the solar system.

Spanish astronomers have revealed a new theory for a 'Y' shape on Venus (annotated image from the Pioneer Venus Orbiter in 1979 shown). They say it is formed by winds pushing a 'wave' of clouds on the planet. These winds move faster at higher altitudes, creating the odd shape

The latest theory was proposed by astronomers from the Institute of Astrophysics of Andalusia (IAA-CSIC) in Granada, Spain, in collaboration with the university of the Basque Country and the Institute of Astrophysics and Space Sciences of Portugal.

Venus is slightly smaller than Earth but has a similar mass.

It is the second closest planet to the sun at a distance of about 67 million miles (108 million kilometres), and takes about 225 days to orbit the sun.

One day on Venus lasts as long as 243 Earth days.

Its thick and toxic atmosphere is made up mostly of carbon dioxide and nitrogen, with clouds of sulphuric acid droplets.

It's believed that its atmosphere contributed to a runaway greenhouse effect that made the planet inhospitable.

The planet's extreme high temperatures of almost 480°C (900°F) make it seem an unlikely place for for life as we know it. 

On Venus strong winds move the upper atmosphere 225 mph (360km/h), circling the planet every four to five Earth days.

But the planet itself takes almost 243 Earth days to complete an orbit - meaning the winds are much faster than the rotation speed of the planet.

The winds have a mostly constant speed at different latitude, but nearer the pole they circle the planet quicker as the circumference of the planet is smaller.

This ultimately gives rise to this ‘Y’ shape, as the clouds at the top and bottom of the shape are moved more quickly.

'This [atmospheric] wave is dragged by the winds of Venus, so if they are constant the wave should round the planet without getting deformed, right?' Dr Javier Peralta, the IAA-CSIC researcher in charge of this study, told MailOnline.

'But we must consider that these waves propagate over a "sphere", and "circles" completed both at the equator and at 40ºN have a different radius (the higher latitude, the smaller the parallels or circles are).

'So, having the same velocity than that at the equator, anything moving horizontally at 40º will complete the longitude of the circle sooner that when doing the same at the equator.

'This is why the wave gets deformed. The area of the wave at higher latitudes complete circles quicker than at the equator.'

Winds on Venus can circle the planet in four to five Earth days. But the planet takes 243 Earth days to rotate, amplifying the Y shape. The effect is also amplified by the winds moving round the planet quicker nearer the poles (Marine 10 image from 1974 shown left). An illustration of the surface of Venus is shown on the right

He added that the idea was not entirely new - but his theory was the first that explained a new type of atmospheric wave, different to anything seen on Earth.

Using the new type of wave, he said they could predict the vertical structure of the Y feature, and show that it was trapped about the altitude where the winds are strongest.

The shape is defined with dark regions, produced by an unknown compound that absorbs ultraviolet radiation. 

The wave seems to be 'pushing up' this ultraviolet absorber from below on Venus - although what this substance is, which gives the feature its dark appearance, remains a mystery.

'It has been a mystery for decades. Nobody knows for sure,' added Dr Peralta.

'Many candidates have been proposed: hydrobromic acid, amorphous sulfur, disulphur monoxide or even living sources such as bacteria.'

The strange shape on Venus was first spotted by Nasa's Mariner 10 spacecraft when it arrived at Venus in 1974. An illustration of the spacecraft is shown here. The new theory could have important implications for other slowly rotating bodies in the solar system

As the clouds are pushed through the atmosphere, those either side are dragged behind, giving the whole planet a ‘stretched’ appearance when viewed in ultraviolet wavelengths. 

When viewed in visible light, the planet simply appears bright yellow or white - as the high amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reflect a lot of sunlight. 

The astronomers have also, for the first time, created a simulation that reproduces the evolution of the shape over the course of a month.

Understanding the shape will allow astronomers to study the ‘super-rotating’ nature of the Venusian atmosphere.

‘A wave with the size of the Y must play a key role in explaining why the atmosphere rotates sixty times faster than the surface, so it was crucial to understand it,’ said Dr Peralta in a release.
