A plus-sized athlete who wrote a blog post about curvy competitors has hit back at critics who say she is promoting obesity.

Leah Gilbert, from Newcastle - 160 kilometres north of Sydney - in New South Wales, trains for half marathons and weighs in at 90 kilograms.

The fitness instructor penned a piece for fitness blog Sportette called 'I'm Plus Size and I'm an Athlete' with the purpose of trying to change change people's perception of trimness equalling fitness.

But along with the positive reactions she was criticised for encouraging people to be obese, which Ms Gilbert insists was not her goal.

The 36-year-old has addressed the backlash on her blog, Body Positive Athletes. The response has been shared more than 2,000 times on Facebook so far.

In it Ms Gilbert acknowledge with the good feedback comes the negative as well.

'There was the anticipated argument that in being satisfied with how my body functioned for me at my racing weight of 90 kilograms I was actively promoting obesity,' she wrote.

'In discussing the history of... weight divisions in both running and triathlon, I was glorifying a group of people who were too "lazy" to work hard to achieve normal weight and wanted it ‘easy’ when it came to competition,' she said.

Ms Gilbert questioned why male athletes did not face the same criticism as their female counterparts.

'There is a lot of double standards sometimes as far as what strengths are celebrated in males sports that aren't celebrated as much in female sports by society,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

On her blog, Ms Gilbert expands: 'When a younger boy presents a larger form, there tends to be (albeit stereotypical) conversations around what a great prop or front rower he would make.

'Big, strong, powerful [NRL] players such as Paul Gallen and "Big Georgie Rose" become their role models. A number of T20 Big Bash stars such as Craig Simmons also present a larger form and are respected for their strength and power, not to mention our top rugby union players such as Benn Robinson. 

The blog post garnered a positive response but also attracted negative ones, which Ms Gilbert has addressed in a new piece

The endurance athlete questioned why male athletes did not face the same criticism as their female counterparts 

'Funnily enough, I don't think I have heard many of these players questioned over their roles in the promotion of obesity.'

Despite some of the negative feedback, Ms Gilbert said she was happy her message had been spread.

'The result that I'm seeing from me working on message is people are getting more active,' she said.

'The message I've been working on is creating a positive response among most people and I just think our health situation is at such a crisis level that we should try some other approaches rather than [fat] shaming.

'I actually have some good statistics from the National Eating Disorder Collaboration that say why it's good to give our adolescent girls in the shapes and size in their role models.

'In one of their recent reports, 70 per cent of adolescent of females said they had some sort of body dissatisfaction.'

Ms Gilbert also cited a Mission Australia report that said body image was the third biggest concern for teenagers.

'It makes me really passionate about getting a range of role models of all different shapes and sizes and abilities so we can keep them in sport,' she said.

'They should view their body from a functional perspective than as an aesthetic. It takes them from a small waist point of view to a "what I need to do to perform in my chosen sport" view.'
