Rear Admiral Sandy Woodward, seen here in London shortly after the end of Falklands War, has died at 81

Sir John ‘Sandy’ Woodward, who led the Royal Navy task force sent to retake the Falklands in 1982, has died, aged 81, following a long illness.

David Cameron hailed his ‘heroic command’ and Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said he would be remembered by many as the Navy’s ‘fighting admiral’.

When Argentina invaded the  Falklands, Sir John was a newly-appointed admiral and acted as commander of the battle fleet from the flagship aircraft carrier,  HMS Hermes.

Ten weeks after the task force left Britain for the South Atlantic, the islands’ capital, Port Stanley, was liberated.

During the conflict, an estimated 600 Argentines were killed along with 255 UK servicemen and three Falklands civilians.

Admiral Woodward was born in  Penzance, Cornwall, and joined the Navy as a schoolboy at the age of 13, attending the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth.

During the Falklands conflict he gave the controversial order to sink the Argentine cruiser, General Belgrano, killing 323. He went on to write a bestselling account of the war, called One Hundred Days.

The admiral later served as Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff and before retiring went on to be the Flag aide-de camp to the Queen.

Sukey Cameron, the Falkland Islands’ government representative in the  UK, tweeted: ‘Sad to learn of the death of Admiral Sir Sandy Woodward; remembering with gratitude the important part he played in Falklands Liberation.’

Two years ago Admiral Woodward told the Daily Mail he feared the islands were ‘now perilously close to being indefensible.’

A strong opponent of cuts to the Navy, he said: ‘The simple truth is without aircraft carriers and without the Americans, we would not have any hope of doing the same again today.’

In written evidence to the Commons defence committee three months ago, he warned Britain would be  unable to defend itself if cuts to the Navy continued to be made.

David Cameron said: 'I am saddened to hear that Admiral Sir John 'Sandy' Woodward has 
passed away -the Admiral was a truly courageous and decisive leader, 
proven by his heroic command of the Royal Navy Task Force during the 
Falklands conflict.

Woodward, who rose to become Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff, later served as Aide-de-Camp to the Queen

'We are indebted to him for his many years of 
service and the vital role he played to ensure that the people of the 
Falkland Islands can still today live in peace and freedom.

'My thoughts 
and prayers are with Admiral Woodward's family and friends at this 
difficult time.'

Defence 
Secretary Philip Hammond commended Admiral Woodward on his 'magnificent 
achievement' and said he would be remembered by many as the Navy’s 
'fighting admiral'.

Mr
Hammond said: 'I am saddened by the news that Admiral Sir John ‘Sandy’ 
Woodward, has died and my thoughts are with his family at this difficult
time.

'Admiral Woodward 
served his country with distinction throughout his career, but will be 
best remembered by many as the Navy’s Fighting Admiral after he led the 
Royal Navy Task Force, sent by Margaret Thatcher, to re-take the 
Falkland Islands in 1982.

'Following
this magnificent achievement he served as the Deputy Chief of the 
Defence Staff and went on before retirement to be the Flag Aide-de Camp 
to the Queen.'

First Sea Lord Admiral Sir George Zambellas said Admiral Woodward was highly regarded and widely respected in the military.

He said: 'Admiral Sir Sandy Woodward will always be remembered for his powerful and clear command of the Royal Navy Task Force that retook the Falkland Islands in 1982.

'Undaunted by the challenge of fighting a capable enemy over 8,000 miles from the UK, in the most demanding and extreme of weather conditions, and against uncertain odds, Admiral Woodward’s inspirational leadership and tactical acumen, meshing the realities of the higher political command at home with the raw and violent fight at sea, was a major factor in shaping the success of the British forces in the South Atlantic.

After playing such a crucial role in the Falklands, Woodward was Flag Officer Submarines and NATO Commander Submarines Eastern Atlantic before becoming Deputy Chief of Defence Staff (Commitments).

'Highly regarded and widely respected within the military, he will be sorely missed and our thoughts are with his family and friends at this difficult time.'

Woodward was born in Penzance, Cornwall, on May 1 1932, according to the Who’s Who annual.  He was educated at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, joined the navy at the age of 13, and rose through the ranks to command submarines - in 1969 he was given his first submarine to command, the hunter-killer Warspite.

He went on to write a memoir of his time as the Falklands task force commander titled One Hundred Days.

Admiral Woodward married Charlotte McMurtrie, with whom he had a son and a daughter, in 1960.  They later separated.  He leaves behind his longtime companion, Winifred Hoult, with whom he lived in Bosham, Sussex.

When Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands on April 2, 1982, Woodward, then aged 49, was given command of the task force that was to transport British troops south to the islands.

Then Prime Minister Mrs Thatcher gave him permission to sink any Argentinian warship outside its national waters - a command that was to prove decisive in the British victory over the agressors.

Woodward was in command of two aircraft carriers, Invincible and Hermes, and some 50 other warships as well as support vessels.  The task force also had, beneath the waves and in secret, a complement of nuclear-powered submarines.

During the journey south, Woodward visited as many of the British ships as he could, telling the officers that the best way of their getting back to Britain alive was to 'do your absolute utmost.  So go and do it.'

On the same trip, he told a BBC reporter: 'I am not in favour of blowing peoples head off.

'However as a loyal servant of the government, if I have to blow peoples heads off, I’ll do it in the most efficient and effective way I know.'

In late April British land forces recaptured South Georgia, and five days later Woodward's ships were near enough to launch a bombardment.

By May 1, Woodward realised that his ships were threatened by a 'pincer movement', with Argentinian aircraft carrier Veinticino de Mayo to the north, and the Belgrano and two destroyers carrying deadly Exocet missiles to the south-west.

The sinking of the Beglrano gave a boost to the British war effort - and produced some memorable headlines

Woodward wanted to attack the aircraft carrier but the British submarines shadowing her had lost contact, so he turned instead to the Belgrano, saying 'I had to take one claw out of the pincer'.

He ordered the nuclear-powered submarine HMS Conqueror, commanded by Christopher Wreford-Brown, to attack, and the Belgrano was torpedoed on May 2 in what would turn out to be one of the most decisive moments of the war.

An estimated 323 men died in the attack, which prompted the infamous newspaper headline 'Gotcha', and while 770 survived by jumping onto liferafts, the attack utterly demoralised the Argentinian forces - as well as hardening the country's resolve.

Two days later HMS Sheffield was hit by an air missile, illustrating how vulnerable the British fleet was, and there were further attacks on the Sir Galahad and the Sir Tristram.

But by 14 June the Argentinians had surrendered, after fierce battles in which the navy played a crucial role, and Woodward was appointed KCB later that year.
