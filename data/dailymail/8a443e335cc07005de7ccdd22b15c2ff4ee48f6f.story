'I'm gonna flip this bus!': Maquel Donyel Morris  attacked a Greyhound driver in Arizona in January causing the bus to careen into a median, injuring dozens

It the middle of the night along Interstate 10 in Arizona. It was late and the lights were off with passengers sleeping, until Maquel Donyel Morris, 25, ran to the front.

He jumped onto the dashboard and grabbed the wheel from the driver nearly causing the bus to swerve into oncoming traffic as he screamed, 'I'm gonna flip this bus!'

The two got into a fight until passengers sitting near the front attempted to pull Morris away.

The camera footage shows the bus careening off the highway, still traveling at 70 miles an hour as it heads into the dirt before hitting something.

Passengers went flying with 24 people hurt leaving seven with broken bones.

Despite
 all his efforts, the bus remained upright and none of the 24 people 
taken to hospitals had life-threatening injuries.

Passengers
 say that's thanks in large part to the efforts of the as yet unnamed 
driver, who at no point in the terrifying ordeal took his hands off the 
steering wheel.

While he was being pummeled, the driver called for passengers to 'get this guy off me.'

'I thought we were all gonna die,' 
Chrissy Sanchez, who was asleep before the attack. 'I woke up to this 
commotion. I remember hearing screaming. ... I realized we were not on 
the road anymore.'

Gregory Forte recalled the moment he knew something wasn't right about his fellow passenger.

'He
 started crying and I knew something was wrong,' Forte said of Morris. 
'It was bizarre. I hope I never have to go through anything like this 
ever again.'

Soon after the bus came to a halt, the driver called 911. Meanwhile Morris and his girlfriend set off running down I-10 fleeing into the desert wilds 50 miles outside Phoenix.

Thirty minutes later, the couple returned to the scene for unknown reasons and Morris was arrested by the highway patrol.

'He was hallucinating ... we believe 
he was very high,' said Arizona Department of Public Safety spokesman Bart 
Graves.

On something: A few days after being arrested, Morris gave a rambling press conference from jail

As he was hauled away in a police car, Morris continued his frightening behavior.

'They're going to kill me,' he screamed from the back of the car to his girlfriend. 'Call my mom!'

Lab tests showed he had meth and amphetamine inÂ  his blood. police say Morris was 'very high' when he assaulted the driver.

He told police someone on the bus with a gun was trying to kill him.

An officer noticed he had white powder around his nose.

Days later Morris held a rambling press conference from jail. He was found incompetent to stand trial a few months later.

'They're gonna kill me! Call my mom': Morris fled into the desert wilds with his girlfriend before returning 30 minutes later. That's when police arrested him and his bizarre state of mind became all too apparent

'Pull him off me!': There were 41 passengers aboard the Dallas-bound bus, some of whom quickly pulled the attacker off the driver around 2am before it came to a stop about 50 miles outside Phoenix

Could have been much worse: Multiple children and at least two infants were reportedly aboard the bus, though police say miraculously no one sustained life threatening injuries
