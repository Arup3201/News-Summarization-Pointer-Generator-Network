The company has been named after the motorbike that his Argentinian father used on his nine-month journey across South America in 1952.

Introducing Mr Guevara, who is a lawyer by profession and the son of Che and his second wife Aleida March, the website states: 'Proud of his people, he always longed to share his experience enjoying the beauty of his country with motorbiking friend who visit the island.

'Through helping make your dreams comes true, Ernesto will also fulfil his. 

The company also includes Mr Guevera's childhood friend Camilo Sanchez a fellow lawyer who shares his passion for motorbikes.

Mechanic Sergio Morales makes up the trip running the company, which offers  five night, six-day from £1,900 ($2,970) and nine-day tours from £2,750 ($4,296).

La Poderosa Tours covers two routes, which Enresto has named Fuser 1 and Fuser 2 after the nickname his father had as a young man.

Tour highlights include visits to places connected to the revolutionary: the Comandancia del Che - a small museum dedicated to him - at the monumental 18th-century Cabaña fortress at Havana’s harbour, where Che had his headquarters; and Che Guevara’s mausoleum in Santa Clara.

Che Guevara - whose first name was also Ernesto - developed his Marxist ideologies following his motorcycle tour of South America aged 23.

The medical student travelled from Argentina to Peru with his friend Alberto Granado on a Norton 500cc bike.

His interest in communism lead to him joining Fidel Castro’s armed revolution that overthrew Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista in 1959.

The diary he kept on his travels around South America was published in 1993 and famously turned into the 2004 film The Motorcycle Diaries.

Guevara was captured by the Bolivian military and executed October 9, 1967.

His remains were recovered in 1997 and transferred to Cuba, where they are buried in a war memorial in Santa Clara, 175 miles east of Havana.
