Chocolate milk: Police say Ruth Vasquez Rodriguez-Martinez choked her six-year-old son after he drank chocolate milk without permission

A Houston mother-of-four was arrested and charged  with both injuring a child and abandoning a child after she choked her six-year-old son because he drank chocolate milk without permission, according to Houston police.

Investigators say that Ruth Vasquez Rodriguez-Martinez, 23, found out her son drank chocolate milk without first seeking her permission and threw him into a closet slamming his head into a wall July 15.

The six-year-old told authorities that his mother locks him in the closet often, but, on this particular day, he hit the wall. There was blood all over the carpet and he was in a lot of pain. 

A criminal complaint stated that Rodriguez-Martinez saw the blood on her son's forehead, but refused to seek medical attention for him because she 'did not want [Child Protective Services] in her life.'

Investigators said that the boy's collision with the wall resulted in a 1-inch scar on his forehead. 

Rodriguez-Martinez told authorities that she held her son by the shirt as she spanked him with a belt, she then grabbed him by the neck and continued to whip him.  

This was not the only incident authorities noted during an investigation of Rodriguez-Martinez.

Unsupervised: The six-year-old son told authorities that Martinez-Rodriguez often leaves him and his three siblings -- ages seven, three, and one -- home alone.
