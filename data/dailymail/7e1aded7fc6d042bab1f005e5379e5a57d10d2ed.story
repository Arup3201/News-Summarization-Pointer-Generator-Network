Bargain hunters looking for Christmas presents have been stripping shelves bare at doomed Comet stores today - the High Street giant's last day of in-store trading.

Shoppers queued outside one of the stricken retailer's shops in Leicester waiting for doors to open this morning as the company called time on 79 years of sales.

Shelves were left empty this afternoon as the store offered discounts on remaining stock and dejected workers were seen dismantling display units and taking down sale posters.

The final store closures come after Comet became the latest big name casualty of the recession, slipping into administration last month.

Today's closures have left the taxpayer with a bill of nearly £50million despite the private equity firm, which 
bought the electrical retailer for a nominal fee of £2 less than a year 
ago, being likely to walk away with almost exactly same amount - £49.7million - 
according to a report by administrator Deloitte.

The
circumstances surrounding the company's demise will now be investigated
by the Insolvency Service's investigations department it was announced 
today.

Following its collapse, Comet’s accounts show it has insufficient funds to cover redundancy payments to its 6,600 staff with the Government now responsible for paying staff their last pay cheque.

And a further £26.1million is lost in tax to HM Revenue & Customs, which is an unsecured creditor and receives nothing.

The Government is therefore nursing a combined £49.1million loss.

The circumstances surrounding the collapse of the company are to be examined by the investigation's branch of the Insolvency Service which will cover the run-up to administration and Comet’s takeover by a private equity-backed investment vehicle in February.

It is understood that the investigation is a matter of course and will check that the processes behind the firm's fall into administration was handled correctly.

A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, said today: 'We can confirm that the Insolvency Service has launched a fact finding inquiry under section 447 of the Companies Act into Comet Group Ltd.

'The purpose of the inquiry is to investigate the circumstances surrounding its insolvency and to establish whether further action is required.

'We are not in a position to comment further at this stage. To do so could prejudice the outcome of the investigation and any future action.

'The Department for Business is already reviewing the overall insolvency regulatory framework, to see whether it remains fit for purpose in today’s environment.'

The Government's £50million loss on behalf of Comet comes despite the fact that there still assets worth almost the same amount in
the business, but under the terms of the administration they belong to 
OpCapita, the controversial private equity firm run by founder Henry 
Jackson.

The 
multi-millionaire American, who is married to Canadian-born pop singer 
Stacey Jackson, managed to put his firm at the front of the queue of 
creditors after taking over the chain of 240 stores eleven months ago.

This
is a legal practice used by investment firms to ensure they lose as 
little cash as possible when they buy troubled businesses and the rescue
fails.

The firm received a £50 million dowry from Kesa as part of the acquisition of the chain and continues to own Comet’s warranties business, which is not in administration.

The vehicle was also repaid a £9.5 million loan prior to the collapse.

Meanwhile, the thousands of ordinary 
customers who still own £4.7million-worth of unused gift cards and 
vouchers remain on the list of unsecured creditors.

Those who paid by credit or debit card will be protected by their card companies, but the rest will get little or nothing back.

City sources say it is unclear whether OpCapita will make a net profit from the debacle.

While
Deloitte shows the company technically lost £95.7m with revenues 
slumping by £200million in the year to April, it is impossible to work 
out how much of this comes out of OpCapita’s own pockets.

It emerged that the company lost a 
further £31 million in the subsequent five months as credit insurers 
lost confidence and withdrew support for the business.

Much of the £145.4million owed by Comet when it went into administration will fall at the door of its banks and investors.

The
closure of the final group of 49 stores from the former 236-strong 
estate comes seven weeks after Deloitte was appointed as administrator.

The collapse of the firm, which was founded in Hull in 1933 and employed 6,895 people, marks one of the biggest high street casualties since the demise of Woolworths in 2008.

Deloitte has failed to find a buyer for the company or any of its shops.

Comet was hit by weak high street trading conditions and fierce competition from online rivals.

Its suppliers could not find insurers willing to cover goods delivered should Comet default on its bills.

The environment for credit insurance became tough and was withdrawn forcing OpCapita to pay for all its stock upfront.

As the crucial Christmas period approached stock levels peaked, making it impossible for the firm to find the necessary cash to buy stock.

In particular, it was knocked by the lack of first-time home-buyers, who had been key customers for Comet.
