A 13-year-old boy who admitted raping a five-year-old girl at a McDonald's 
play area has been sentenced to an inpatient treatment
facility for at least six months.

The Hamilton County Juvenile Court administrator says the boy, from Ohio, must 
successfully complete treatment before his release from the secured 
center.

The judge also placed the teen on probation today.

Suspect: The boy, who is just 13, was brought in to police after his parents recognized him from surveillance footage

Last month the boy entered the juvenile equivalent of a guilty plea to the rape charge in Cincinnati.

Authorities say the assault occurred on October 29 at a McDonald's in the 
Cincinnati suburb of Anderson Township.

They say the girl's grandmother 
was nearby in the restaurant at the time.

The boy's parents brought him to authorities after a security camera photo of the suspect was released.

The couple recognized their son wearing a jacket, jeans and trainers in security camera footage from the fast food restaurant.

After the incident the little girl 
went to her grandmother nearby 'with the look on her face as if 
something was wrong'. Police said he climbed into the play area 
specifically to molest her.

The girl was inside the indoor play 
area on her own at around 9pm when she was approached. The boy left 
moments before she reported the assault.

The woman who called 911 told police: 
'There was an incident in the play area with an older child and a 
younger child which may have involved some sexual contact'.

Restaurant: Jason Pickard, who owns this Ohio McDonald's franchise, is working with police and said: 'The safety and well-being of my customers, especially children, is extremely important'

Police revealed that their suspect was
wearing a University of Cincinnati jacket, was around 5’3” high and 
weighed around 125lbs.

Hours later his parents brought him in
where he admitted to the crime, police said. He 
was captured on CCTV inside the McDonald's as he entered and left.

Parents reacted with horror and said 
it was 'obscene' what had happened. McDonald's customer Margo Mather 
said: 'I don't want my kids going over there just playing by 
themselves.'

'It's frightening. I have kids and I take them there all the 
time. I've never had a problem ever. Usually there's parents and 
supervised kids. It’s really a great place for when 
its winter time and you've got to let your kids run off all their 
energy. It’s scary... my son's six so it could easily have been him'

Heather Kenyon, another customer, 
added: 'It's frightening. I have kids and I take them there all the 
time. I've never had a problem ever. Usually there's parents and 
supervised kids.

‘It’s really a great place for when 
its winter time and you've got to let your kids run off all their 
energy. It’s scary... my son's six so it could easily have been him'.

Jason Pickard, the McDonald's franchise owner, was working with police to find out what happened.

He said: 'The safety and well-being of
my customers, especially children, is extremely important. I'm taking 
this matter very seriously and fully cooperating with authorities in 
their investigation.'
