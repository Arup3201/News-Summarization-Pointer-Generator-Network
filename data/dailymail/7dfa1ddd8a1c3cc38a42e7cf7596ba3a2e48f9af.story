The California Assembly is holding its first hearing on a bill that would have to end its killer whale shows and remove 10 orcas from their tanks.

The bill, number AB2140, comes as a result of the CNN documentary 'Blackfish' which delved into the aggression of one of the male whales that led to a trainer's death.

The bill's backers say killer whales are too large and intelligent for captivity, while SeaWorld says the animals are well treated and help conservation through research.

Freeing the wales: A new bill up for debate in California could end the use of killer wales by SeaWorld, making it illegal for them to be kept in captivity

The 2013 film blames attacks and deaths of SeaWorld trainers on the mistreatment of the animals, increasing their aggression.

SeaWorld calls the film anti-captivity propaganda.

The bill was put forth by Democratic Assemblyman Richard Bloom and also bans the import and export of orcas.

Under his measure, SeaWorld could keep the animals it has in a larger sea pen until they die.

The Tuesday hearing comes days after a seperate court hearing in Florida connected to their ongoing battle against rival Marineland revealed that the animals have been put on psychoactive drugs akin to Valium.

The orcas are dosed with benzodiazepine, which is designed to quell anxiety and commonly causes users to become drowsy. Prolonged use has been proven to cause panic attacks, out-of-body experiences, and muscle spasms.

The allegations were confirmed by former SeaWorld vice president, now president and CEO of Pacific Research Laboratories Inc, Dr Lanny Cornell in a statement to the court.

PETA told MailOnline 'the end is near' for SeaWorld.

In a statement, the animal rights organisation said: 'SeaWorld is in deep trouble and hot water since Blackfish showed the mental anguish of orcas taken from the great oceans and trapped for eternity in SeaWorld's swimming pools â€“ and now court documents have revealed that SeaWorld also pumps these marine slaves full of psychotropic drugs in order to force them to perform stupid tricks.

'If SeaWorld executives were locked up within our prison system, they would experience luxurious accommodation in comparison to those of the highly social, intelligent marine animals they imprison, which cause them to lash out, chew their own teeth to the nubs and attack their trainers.

The park suffered long-term damage after the release of the 2013 documentary, which set out to investigate how animals react to life in captivity and became a critical examination of SeaWorld's treatment of whales.

For 12 months after the film's January release, the park was hit with cancellations from high-profile performers and school field trips, as well as aggressive animal activist campaigns.

In December, the Orlando-based marine park attempted to salvage its reputation by placing full-page adverts in eight of the country's largest newspapers, rationalising their whale practices.
