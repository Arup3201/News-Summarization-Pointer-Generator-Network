A great-grandmother who has been named the oldest bar maid in the world is celebrating her 100th birthday, but despite having pulled pints since 1940 she has no plans to retire.

Dolly Saville still works three days a week at The Red Lion Hotel in Wendover, Buckinghamshire, and has been working for 74 years.

She started pulling pints when she was 26, just before World War II, and she estimates that she has poured around two million pints since she began.

Over the last seven decades she has served many famous faces, including James Bond actor Pierce Brosnan, former Prime Minister Ted Heath, footballer Stanley Matthews, singer Vera Lynn, ballet dancer Margot Fonteyn and actress Elizabeth Taylor.

Until six years ago when she was 94 she was still working at least six hours a day, six days a week and has only ever had two weeks sick leave her entire life.

Now she has had to reduce her shifts to three hours a week, but still spends the time working on her feet clearing tables, serving customers and polishing glasses.

The pensioner, who has three grandchildren, three great-grandchildren 
and one great-great granddaughter, has even had the bar she works at 
named 'Dolly’s' in her honour.

Mrs Saville, whose two children are both retired, said: 'I love my work and I love the people, it keeps me going and it’s better
 than sitting around.

'I
 never thought I would be here this long, but I’ve loved every minute of
 it. My family keeps asking if I want to stop, but I have no plans to 
retire.

'My boss is lovely and if he asked me to work an extra shift I would say yes as he has been so kind to me.'

Mrs Saville was born in Eton, Berkshire, and moved to Wendover at the age of three.

At 14, she left school and went into service as a house maid.

She married in her late teens and her daughter Anne was born soon after, followed by her son Roland.

When war broke out several years later, her husband joined the RAF and Dolly had to get a job to support the family.

She
 had never done bar work before but was offered a job in the hotel by 
the landlord who spotted her walking past one day with her children.

Even now she works a large amount of hours, especially for a 99 year old, and has no plans to stop working

Despite the fact that both her children are both retired, she says she will work at the bar until the day she dies

She said: 'The
 landlord asked if I would like to work there, but I said no as I hadn’t
 worked in a bar before and I never thought anymore about it.

'Then
 he saw me up the High Street and asked if I’d thought anymore about it.
 I said I hadn’t but he said "why don’t you give it a try" so I said I 
would.

'I started just washing up glasses in the saloon bar. Then, 
after I’d been there about five or six weeks he said I think you could 
serve.

'I said ‘Oh I don’t think so, I’d give them the wrong change!’ But I did, and I got on very well.'

When Mrs Saville first started the 16th Century hotel had three bars, a public bar, a saloon bar and a cocktail bar, and she would work in all three.

Her children, who were three and five at the time, would be left to play in the staff room or the beautiful hotel gardens.

She said: 'I worked in all three bars and over the years I’ve also cooked in the kitchen, done the bedrooms, the reception and the teas. I’ve done the lot.

'It has always been great fun and sometimes after a long shift I would be tired but we would go out dancing.'

'Even after the hotel, which has historical links with Oliver Cromwell and Robert Louis Stevenson, was closed five years ago for six months refurbishment Dolly refused to give up work.

Instead she went to the nearby King and Queen pub in Wendover, and continued working at the bars.

She said: 'I was so sad when they closed for six months.

'But I went to the King and Queen instead, they asked me if I would go there and I quite enjoyed that I must say!

'I get very bored if I’m sitting too long. I must be doing something and working keeps my brain active.

'I think that comes from when I left school at 14 and I went into private service. You had to work then, there was no nonsense, and if you didn’t do it properly you did it again.'

Mrs Saville was famous for being such a long-serving bar maid before her 100th birthday, and is missed by the regulars if she is not around.

In addition, over the years she has also served many celebrities.

She said: 'I served Pierce Brosnan when he had lunch at the hotel while he was filming one of the Bond films.

'I also made tea and toast for Ted Heath when he came in on a chilly afternoon.

'Vera Lynn has also popped into the hotel several times for lunch. I think everyone in the village knows me now.'

Mrs Saville's granddaughter Kim Leemans said: 'We tried to get her to retire years ago but she said no, so we gave up the fight and let her carry on and it keeps her going'

Mrs Saville now works three lunch times a week.

She added: 'The hotel has changed over the years, Dolly’s bar used to be the dining room and we used to serve teas in the afternoon and I would clean all the brass.

'I was busy all the time and never minded what I did, I loved it.'

Mrs Saville’s daughter Anne Edwards, 79, from Wendover, said until she was 94 her mum would work a morning shift, come home for lunch, then go back again in the evening.

The pensioner had just started working at the bar and was just 26.

King George VI was on the throne, Winston 
Churchill was Prime Minister and Britain was in the grip of World War 
Two.

The battle of France began, and the Dutch official surrendered to the German forces.

Paris was eventually bombed and invaded, while the French Resistance began their preliminary planning for guerrilla counter-attacks.

Later, the 'Battle of Britain' began, with the Nazi Luftwaffe consistently bombing London, and several parts of England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland, at strategic points, such as docks and aeronautical manufacturing plants.

This led to a period called the Blitz (a result of the British 'blackout') a pattern of strategic bombings by Nazi planes over populated areas.

The draft of around 16 million men began in the U.S, prior to their involvement in the war.

Also, Bugs Bunny made his debut in the Oscar-nominated cartoon short, A Wild Hare.

'She is remarkable and still works three shifts a week,” she said.

'We suggested she should stop but she is determined to carry on and I think a lot of the customers would be up in arms if she left.

'When she started the job it was out of necessity, but I think it gradually became her life.'

Mrs Saville’s granddaughter Kim Leemans said: 'We tried to get her to retire years ago but she said no, so we gave up the fight and let her carry on and it keeps her going.

Her colleagues, who are holding a big party for her on her birthday, are also full of praise for her.

Martin Howard, manager of the hotel, said: 'Dolly is an amazing person and the life and soul of the staff parties. She is still young at heart and the staff love her.'

Robert Hynes, deputy manager, said: 'She is amazing and the customers absolutely love her. She has told me she doesn’t want to leave until the day she dies.

'The younger members of staff aspire to be like her and think she’d brilliant. I think the job keeps her going and gives her something to look forward to.

'We get regulars who come in especially to see Dolly and in the run up to her birthday they’ve been travelling from further afield to see her.'

Hideko Arima, from Japan, was formerly the world’s oldest bar maid.

She worked at her tiny bar, Gilbey Ai in Tokyo’s Ginza district for 52 years until she was 101, and died in 2003.
