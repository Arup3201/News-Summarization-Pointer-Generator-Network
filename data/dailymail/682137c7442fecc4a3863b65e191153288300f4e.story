Monaco's royal family has welcomed its newest member: a baby boy born to the daughter of Princess Caroline.

The palace announced this morning that Charlotte Casiraghi, 27, gave birth yesterday at Princess Grace Hospital.

She and her 42-year-old French comedy actor boyfriend of two years, Gad Elmaleh, have named the child Raphael.

New parents: Monaco royal Charlotte Casiraghi, 27, and her 42-year-old French actor boyfriend, Gad Elmaleh, have welcomed their first child together, a boy named Raphael

The little boy is the second Monegasque royal to be born this year: Charlotte's brother Andrea and his wife Tatiana Santo Domingo welcomed their son Sacha in March.

In the run up to the birth, Gad, who has a 12-year-old son named No√© from his relationship with actress Anne Brochet, told People magazine that his girlfriend, Charlotte, would be 'the best mother in the world,' because she is 'generous and loving'.

The couple raised eyebrows when they got together in December 2011 because of their 15-year age gap. However, there is no doubt that they are a good match.

Just recently, Gad spoke about what drew them together and described his partner as 'a smart and very intelligent girl who has a lot of humour' and makes him the 'happiest man.'

'You can talk about philosophy and make stupid jokes with her,' the Moroccan-born talent continued.

'We go to see art or she will go crazy over a TV show and laugh out loud with me about a stupid gag.'

He added: 'We have real conversations and share things. I'm the happiest man - really, I am. I am lucky to be with her.'

The Monaco royals have also accepted the relationship, with the actor adding that Princess Caroline laughs at his jokes.

Whether the new parents will marry 
remains to be seen. This summer rumors emerged that they were engaged 
after Charlotte was spotted out and about wearing a silver band on her 
left ring finger.

However, the couple later snuffed reports with Gad recently musing 'maybe one day'.

Charlotte, who is not herself a princess, is the second child of Caroline and the late Italian businessman Stephano Casiraghi, who tragically died in a boat race accident when she was just four-years-old.

Caroline is Albert's older sister, daughter of the late Prince Rainier and the late American actress Grace Kelly.

Multi-talented: While she will now be focused on motherhood, Charlotte has had a varied career to date as a champion equestrian and a model for Gucci's Forever Now campaign

This makes Charlotte fifth in line to the throne.

It emerged that she was pregnant in August as she sported a noticeable baby bump while holidaying in Capri with her beau.

Covering her stomach with a loose-fitting dress, the royal didn't seem to be trying to keep the news under the radar as she was spotted going into a maternity shop.

She met Gad, who has starred in Priceless and Midnight In Paris, in late 2011 at the party of a mutual friend.

While she will now be focused on motherhood, the aristocrat has had a varied career to date, as a champion equestrian, a model for Gucci's Forever Now campaign and a journalist.
