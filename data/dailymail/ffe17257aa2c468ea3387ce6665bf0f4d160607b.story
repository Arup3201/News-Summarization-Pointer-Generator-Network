Spanish researchers have come up with a dramatic new theory for the end of the Neanderthal -  that  humans ate them.

The researchers say that Homo Sapiens can be considered an 'alien invasive species', and point out we have already contributed to the extinction of 178 large mammals.

Today they called for further research on the bones of Neanderthal man to look for signs of human tooth marks.

Lunch? Spanish team say Homo Sapiens should be considered 'alien invasive species'

Neanderthal man lived across Europe around 300,000 years ago.

They managed to survive several ice 
ages before dying out around 30,000 years ago, around the same time as 
human beings arrived on the continent from Africa.

One theory for the Neanderthals 
disappearance is that they couldn't compete with humans, who had better 
brains and more sophisticated tools, for scarce resources such as food.

Other scientists believe they were more susceptible to the impact of climate change.

'Except in its native Africa, in the 
other continents Homo sapiens can be considered as an invasive alien 
species,' write researchers Policarp Hortolà and Bienvenido 
Martínez-Navarro of the Universitat Rovira i Virgili in Tarragona, 
Spain.

They published their hypothesis in the May issue of the journal Quaternary International - but admit they have no proof yet.

'The only manner to test it is to 
find direct evidences of modern human eating marks on Neanderthal 
remains, such cut or broken marks on bones in artifacts made by 
modern humans,' he said.

The team believe that as Homo Sapien spread into Europe and Asia, where Homo neanderthalensis was, it was treated just another food source - and a competitor.

'We think that modern humans, who occupied a similar ecological niche as Neanderthals, directly competed with Neanderthals for the food and other natural resources,' Martínez-Navarro told Discovery News.

The researchers point out several other species have suffered similar fates, killing off their nearest relatives.

In 2009, researcher may have found the first evidence of the theory analysing the markings on a Neanderthal jawbone found in Les Rois, south-west France during a study conducted by the Journal of Anthropological Sciences.

The cuts to the bone are similar to those left on those of deer and other animals butchered by humans in the Stone Age, the researchers say.

It is believed that the flesh was eaten by humans and the teeth used to make a necklace.Grisly end: Neanderthals may have been devoured by humans who also may have used their teeth for necklaces.

Leader of the research team, Fernando Rozzi, of Paris's Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, said: 'Neanderthals met a violent end at our hands and in some cases we ate them.

'For years, people have tried to hide away from the evidence of cannibalism, but I think we have to accept it took place.'
