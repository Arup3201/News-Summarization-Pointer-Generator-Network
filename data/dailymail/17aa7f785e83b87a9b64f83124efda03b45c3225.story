A grandmother was branded a 'f***ing nut case' and told she had 'no rights' by policemen who pulled her over after she 'clipped' an officer while driving through a road block.

The Victoria Police officers involved in the alarming incident in the Melbourne suburb of South Yarra in 2012 are now under investigation, The Age reports.

The heated exchange with then 63-year-old charity worker Linda Milazzo was captured on camera by an officer wearing a body-cam and used as evidence in court.

In the video, Milazzo screams 'I'm having a heart attack' as she's told to 'step out of the car' by an officer.

A Victoria police officer was filmed during a heated exchange with Linda Milazzo

'You just attempted to run down a policeman,' Senior Constable Kael Oostuizen said.

The officer told her 'you don't look like you're having a heart attack to me'.

Milazzo had in fact recently had a heart attack and started to yell out as the officer tried to get her out of the car.

He pulled her arm and said: 'You shouldn't have run away, you know you haven't got any rights at the minute.'

'Please don't hurt me,' she responded before letting out a horrifying scream.

Another officer is then heard describing her as a 'f***ing nutcase'.

Milazzo wrongly cited a law which she thought meant she didn't have to stop for police.

'You evaded police,' the officer said. 'I'm allowed to, on the 26 November last year a Supreme Court judge found a ruling that you do not have to stop for a blue light,' she mistakenly argued.

Footage filmed by police showed Milazzo driving through the road block and she was given a six month driving ban

'You see how far that gets you in court, not very far at all,' the officer responded, as Milazzo called him a bully.

The footage was shown in Melbourne's County Court.

Prosecutor Mark Regan argued police had shown restraint by not pulling her out of her car.

But Judge John Carmody asked Mr Regan to 'imagine if the [chief] commissioner heard the full set of these tapes'.

Defence barrister Alan Marshall said Milazzo acted in a 'highly unusual fashion' and that she regrets not stopping.

Mr Marshall told Daily Mail Australia that although he wasn't shocked by the case it is 'terribly unusual'.

At one point an officer grabbed her arm to try and get her out of the car but she screamed

'You don't normally get the video of the behaviour... it's usually my client says this was said, but it's usually denied. This time it was filmed.'

The grandmother was banned from driving for six months, put on a non-conviction undertaking to be of good behaviour for 12 months and was fined $1000. 

A police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: 'Victoria Police members are expected to demonstrate professionalism at all times and complaints in relation to unprofessional behaviour are taken seriously. 

'As a result of the issues raised in this case the matter has been referred to Professional Standards Command for further investigation.'
