The finest golfer in world watched his ball scuttle across the eighth green, and winced in anguish as the putt died a premature death. There was a muted gasp from the gallery, then a desperate voice cried: ‘It’s all right, Rory! Don’t worry, it’s all right.’

A shadow of a smile crossed McIlroy’s face, his colleague Sergio Garcia tidied up the lapse, and the players moved on.

And yet, it was a strangely revealing moment, one which reminded us that this remarkable man is just 25 years old; blessed with prodigious talent, bearing onerous responsibilities, yet still capable of arousing the protective instinct in total strangers.

It's not over yet - the Ryder Cup can go either way

He moves around the course on a wave of affection, people call his name with the familiarity of old friends. Yet the demands are daunting. After what he has achieved, excellence is the very least we expect. The wonder is that he keeps both his sanity and his good humour; riding the wave as if he still cannot quite believe his luck. 

If Europe are to win the Ryder Cup on Sunday, then McIlroy’s contribution may prove crucial. Such is the stature of his talent, and such the influence he exerts within his team.

He spent Saturday morning’s fourball effectively nursing Ian Poulter towards simple competence. There was no grandstanding, no demonstrations of obvious authority, but the most casual observer would have discerned the senior partner. 

When Poulter finally flowered, McIlroy slapped his back and shared his joy. It was a genuinely impressive performance.

In the afternoon, with Garcia, his nursing duties were similarly in evidence. Again, there was no exhibitionism, no signs of impatience. Garcia was thankful: ‘I think Rory beat three guys today, not just two,’ he said. ‘He was amazing.’ McIlroy beamed his embarrassment. ‘I’m very lucky with my partners,’ he said, and sounded as if he meant it.

The fact that Europe are taking control of this Cup simply reinforced their mood of mutual admiration, but the dominance is clearly based on collective class. And it is McIlroy who sets the standards.

Another small cameo spoke volumes. At the ninth, with McIlroy and Garcia clinging to their one-hole lead, Rory contemplated the distant green, selected a long iron, and spanked the ball through several postcodes to the very heart of the green. As the ball left the club, his captain and countryman Paul McGinley gasped: ‘That’s a great shot, Rory! A great shot!’ 

The words were spoken in awed tones, a full second before the import of the stroke had registered with the galleries. Sergio just shook his head, smiled his delight and bowled along to the distant green, knowing his game was in good hands.

That ability to dispatch the ball a country mile is perhaps the most spectacular trait of McIlroy’s game. Those who truly understand the mechanics of the golf swing could doubtless explain how a man standing 5ft 9in tall and weighing 11st 5lb can generate such stunning power. The rest of us can only watch and wonder.

And the crowds just revere him, partly through his genius, partly because of the affability of his bearing. People talk to him, joke with him, as they would a favourite brother.

At the sixth tee on Saturday afternoon, he dived into the tee-side toilet while waiting for the crowd to clear the green. When he emerged, a solicitous matron inquired: ‘Better now?’ He gave her a nod. ‘Much better, thanks,’ he responded, and carried on with the Ryder Cup. 

It was scarcely Wildean wit, but others would have ignored the woman. That is obviously not his way. The people responsible for raising and rearing the impressive young man were following his every shot on Saturday.

His father, Gerry, faded into the small squad of people who follow the players inside the ropes. Clutching a white woolly hat, he looked on anonymously as his son went to work. His mother, Rosie, kept a similarly low profile as she huddled on the caddy cart chugging behind the pack. There was no show, no seeking cheap attention. 

That is not the way of folk in their little corner of County Down. But their pride in the boy was unmistakable. He was a credit to them, a credit to Moneyreagh.

Only once did he come close to anger, and that on the seventh fairway, when the match referee belatedly ruled that it was the Americans turn to play while McIlroy was standing over his ball.

‘But I’m ready!’ he protested. ‘Can’t you see I’m ready?’ He thrust his iron back into his bag, and then, after a second’s reflection, he giggled like a small boy, and got on with the game. Everyone chuckled, conspiring in the moment. On Saturday, he could do no wrong.

So on he went, intimidating tremendous players like Jim Furyk and Hunter Mahan by the sheer force of his ability. And he brought his partner, Garcia, home by a handsome 3&2. More heroics will be required from him on Sunday, of course. 

More minor miracles, more shots which are beyond the scope or imagination of ordinary golfers. But there is no sign as yet that the pressure is weighing heavily upon him. Indeed, he actually seems to revel in the impudent expectations.

It has something to do with his youth, much to do with his talent, and just about everything to do with his personality. For at the moment, and along with the dazzlingly excellent Justin Rose, Rory McIlroy seems to own Gleneagles. He is a credit to his sport, a credit to Europe, most importantly, he is a credit to Moneyreagh, County Down. You suspect he would settle for that.
