Yankees pitcher CC Sabathia has been accused of blowing a fuse in a New Jersey airport Saturday morning over a missed Jamaica-bound flight.

After reaching Newark Liberty International Airport, Sabathia and the 11 other people he was traveling with were told it was too late for them to get on the plane, TMZ Sports reported.

Port Authority was contacted after 'CC started freaking out' at airline workers, a source told the website.

Incident: Yankees pitcher CC Sabathia reportedly blew a fuse in a New Jersey airport Saturday morning over a missed Jamaica-bound flight

Sabathia was calmed down by police officers, who did not arrest or cite anyone, TMZ Sports reported.

The baseball player arranged a later trip on behalf of his group, which successfully arrived in Jamaica, according to the website.

A Port Authority spokesman told MailOnline 12 travelers showed up together at the airport at 6:45am for a 7am flight to Montego Bay, Jamaica.

The group had not gone through security screenings yet and would not have made it onto the plane in time, so United Airlines employees declined to let them board, the spokesman said.

The spokesman said he could not confirm if Sabathia was one of the travelers in the incident. 

A different flight was booked for Montego Bay, the spokesman said, and confirmed that there were no arrests or summonses  from the incident.

Sabathia has a degenerative knee condition in his right knee, and must undergo plasma treatments in order to play this spring, according to The New York Post.

Both the Yankees and a representative for Sabathia did not immediately return a request for comment from MailOnline.
