Last minute: Missouri late on Wednesday executed Herbert Smulls after the U.S. Supreme Court denied last-minute appeals that in part challenged the drug used in the execution

A Missouri death row prisoner on the phone to his attorney discussing his appeal was hauled away in the middle of the call and put to death four minutes before the Supreme Court denied his final stay request.

Herbert Smulls, 56, was pronounced dead at 10.20 pm after receiving a lethal dose of pentobarbital, a fast-acting barbiturate, but emails reveal that state officials were aware that the justices of the US Supreme Court were still considering his appeal.

It was Missouri's third execution since November and the third since switching to new drug, pentobarbital, for the lethal injection - which Smulls' legal team said might not be as pure and as potent as it should be, which could cause undue suffering.

Smulls' attorneys said last week that this was theÂ  third straight case in which Missouri has moved ahead with an execution while the case was still in court.

While Missouri says it's perfectly legal to carry out executions before all appeals are exhausted, legal experts say the practice is rare.

And the concerns from defense attorneys come as the death penalty in general is getting increased scrutiny amid separate questions about the drugs states are using to execute inmates.

Execution: Herbert Smulls was pronounced dead at 10:20 p.m. local time on Wednesday at a state prison in Bonne Terre after receiving a lethal dose of pentobarbital, a fast-acting barbiturate, Missouri Department of Corrections spokesman Mike O'Connell said

Smulls, 56, was put to death late Wednesday after a protracted legal battle that lasted more than two decades, a legal fight that extended to his final day of life. Smulls was scheduled to die at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday, but various appeals pushed the case deep into the evening.

Attorneys for Smulls made one final push just before 10 p.m. for a stay from the U.S. Supreme Court, which had already ruled on other appeals that the execution could proceed.

Timing was becoming a factor because the death warrant expired at 11:59 p.m. A new execution date would be required if Smulls was still alive at midnight.

He wasn't. The execution began at 10:11 p.m., and Smulls was pronounced dead at 10:20 p.m.

Joseph Luby, an attorney for Smulls, said he received an email at 10:30 p.m. from the Supreme Court, saying the stay application was denied at 10:24 p.m. - four minutes after Smulls was pronounced dead.

'It's just troubling and fundamentally lawless,' Luby said.

Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster, in an emailed statement, said the state did nothing wrong.

'The United States Supreme Court has ruled that pending litigation is not sufficient to stop an execution,' Koster wrote. 'The legal mechanism for a federal court to stop an execution is a court-ordered stay.'

Koster wrote that the state 'directly asked the United States Supreme Court if the execution of Herbert Smulls should be stayed; for the third time that day, the Court said no. No stay of execution was in effect at the time of execution.'

Missouri has executed three convicted killers in the past three months. Luby said that in all three cases, appeals were still pending.

One of the people executed was Allen Nicklasson. A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had refused to grant a stay, but the full appeals court had not yet heard the case, Circuit Judge Kermit Bye wrote in a dissenting opinion days after that execution.

'In my near fourteen years on the bench, this is the first time I can recall this happening,' the judge wrote.

Columbia Law School professor Jim Liebman said it is unusual, but not unheard of, for an execution to proceed with an appeal still pending. He agreed that corrections officials could reach the point of believing that enough is enough.

'You wouldn't be surprised if the state felt that way, maybe with justification, but the procedure is to have a court say that, not for the state to say that,' Liebman said.

Final moments; Smulls, 56, did not make a final statement. He mouthed a few words to his two witnesses, who were not identified, then breathed heavily twice and shut his eyes for good.

Texas, the nation's most active death penalty state, generally waits until all appeals are exhausted before carrying out executions.

In a few cases, the U.S. Supreme Court has put a halt to the stream of appeals by issuing an order that it would no longer accept petitions in a case, Liebman said. The court issued no such halt in Smulls' case.

'What that does is sort of put a legal end to the matter,' Liebman said.

Attorneys for Smulls filed several appeals in the weeks and days leading up to the execution, and on the final day.

Many centered on concerns about the way Missouri obtains its execution drug from an unnamed compounding pharmacy.

At least two recent executions have raised concerns about the effectiveness of drugs used in executions, putting increased scrutiny on how states carry out the death penalty.

Two weeks ago, Ohio inmate Dennis McGuire took 26 minutes to die by injection, gasping repeatedly as he lay on a gurney with his mouth opening and closing. And on January 9, Oklahoma inmate Michael Lee Wilson's final words were, 'I feel my whole body burning.'

Some of the other appeals centered on that fact that Smulls, who was black, was convicted by an all-white jury.

Florence Honickman called all the appeals a 'travesty.' She has permanent injuries after being shot by Smulls in the 1991 jewelry store robbery in suburban St. Louis that killed her husband, Stephen.

Smulls was the sixth person executed in the United States in 2014 and the third in Missouri since November

Honickman and her two adult children spent most of Tuesday and Wednesday at the prison in Bonne Terre, Mo., waiting through the late appeals until finally witnessing Smulls' death.

'I believe it is cruel and unacceptable both to the criminal about to be executed and to the victims' family that after endless appeals, 20-plus years on death row and after the execution date has been set, the criminal is given hope of a stay based on absurd technical and procedural matters,' Florence Honickman said.

Smulls was convicted of shooting Stephen Honickman while robbing his jewelry store in July 1991. Honickman's wife Florence, who was also shot during the attack, sustained permanent injuries.

Smulls was originally scheduled to die after 12:01 a.m. Central Time on Wednesday and so had his final meal of fried chicken, steak, collard greens, macaroni and cheese, candied yams, corn bread, chocolate cake, and cola on Tuesday afternoon.

Missouri and several other states have turned to compounding pharmacies, which are not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, to prepare drugs for executions after an increasing number of pharmaceutical manufacturers objected to their drugs being used in capital punishment.

The increasing use of in some cases untested compounded drugs has revived the debate over the death penalty in the United States.

In Oklahoma, an inmate said he felt burning through his body when the drugs used to kill him were injected during an execution in early January. Later in the month, an Ohio man gasped and convulsed during his execution with a two-drug mix never before used in the United States.
