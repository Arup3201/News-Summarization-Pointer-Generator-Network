This week it was revealed that increasing numbers of childless women are signing up to 'natural insemination' websites - online meeting places that put women who want sperm together with men who want sex.

Despite the obvious risks it has been suggested that women are turning to the sites because of the soaring cost of IVF, which can be up to £2,000 per cycle using donor sperm.

But does that mean having unprotected sex with a stranger in order to have a baby - who will never know its father - any more acceptable?

Many, including parenting expert Kelly Rose Bradford, believe getting pregnant this way will always be wrong - from a moral and a health standpoint.

But journalist Sally Windsor believes that women should be allowed to get pregnant in any way they wish.

Appearing on This Morning, Sally admitted she has even gone one further with her thought process - once writing of her plans to trick a stranger into getting her pregnant should motherhood not have happened to her in time.

Controversial: The debate gets underway with Windsor (right) in favour and Bradford (left) against

The debate, which took place on ITV breakfast show This Morning, provoked strong reactions, with Windsor blasting women who 'sit around' and wait for Mr Right as 'archaic'.

Windsor admitted that while she did not go through with plans to trick a stranger into impregnating her, she still stands by the idea.

'Sitting back and waiting to become a parent is archaic,' she argued. There's no point in sitting around and waiting for it [parenthood] to happen to you.'

Asked by Phillip Schofield why she did not have the planned one night stand she said: 'My circumstances changed. I've got my little girl, my house... so it just didn't happen.'

Windsor shot to fame last year when she wrote an article headlined: 'I'll trick a stranger into giving me another child: A single mother who's desperate to be pregnant again, confesses all...'

In the piece, which appeared in the Daily Mail, Windsor wrote: 'I have decided to find a man to provide a second child for me.

'The transaction will be an uncomplicated one: he will sleep with me - once, if my plan works out - and I will become pregnant.

'And that is where his paternal duty will end. There will be no rights or obligations on his part: no access visits, no calls on his time and attention; and he will have no financial involvement in the child’s upbringing whatsoever.'

During the interview, she revealed that the support she got in the wake of the piece was phenomenal and said that it 'made it even more apparent that it [natural insemination] does go on all the time.'

'What is difference between one night stands and natural donation?' she added. 'I wouldn't trick anyone. The actual 
story was more that if someone pulled me up on it, I'd admit it. But if 
woman goes into bar and isn't actively deceiving the man then there's no problem.'

Horrified, Kelly Rose Bradford riposted: 'Everyone knows that [unplanned] pregnancies do happen but I would expect most women to do their utmost to tell the man what has happened.

'The problem with websites like these is that they reduce having a baby to scouring the internet for sperm. I would also ask why men are doing it? For sex?'

Not true, says Windsor, who said that she had discovered that some would-be natural inseminators genuinely want to help out.

Heated: Things got a bit tense when Sally Windsor got into an argument with Phillip Schofield

'Some men genuinely 
want to provide sperm and just want to see life go on,' she said. 'They don't want responsibility for the child, so this is right for them.'

But for Bradford, having sex with a stranger purely to get pregnant is nothing more than 'no-strings sex'.

'We grew up with messages about the dangers of having unprotected sex,' she explained. 'At least if it's with your partner, you know what you're getting into.'

In response to Windsor, who likened it to normal sperm donation, she added:

'I think if you go to an organisation, then it's very 
different from picking someone up. And what if you later meet someone and have 
children with them?

'You have a child with no idea who they really are and you can't exactly tell them what really happened [when they were conceived].

'It's very different to deliberately go into situation that could put your health or life at risk.'
