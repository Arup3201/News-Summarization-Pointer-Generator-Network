 A 51-year-old armed  man was shot dead by Queensland Police on the Sunshine Coast after they were called to deal with a disturbance.  

The incident happened just after 2pm at a house in Tewantin after the man 'confronted' the policemen on the street. 

Acting Superintendent John Bosnjak told a media conference on Sunday evening that the man shot dead was not from Queensland.
