More than a quarter of the people on a register of violent and sex offenders have never spent time in prison.

Official figures also reveal that over three-quarters of known sex offenders are at large in the community – more than 8,000 in London alone.

The Violent and Sex Offender Register is a database of those required to register with the police under the Sexual Offences Act 2003, those jailed for more than 12 months for violent offences, and those thought to be at risk of offending.

Dangerous: There are a total of 64,484 registered sex offenders in Britain, many of whom have never faced prison

There are a total of 64,484 registered offenders in Britain.

Tory MP Priti Patel, a campaigner against soft justice, obtained the first breakdown of the jail records of those regarded as such a significant risk that they have been put on the list.

The number of registered sex offenders who do not have a custody record is 17,758 – 27.5 per cent of the total number.

The number in prison, including those detained in hospital, is 15,065 or 23.4 per cent of the total.

Some 30.4 per cent had been to prison or detained in hospital at some point over the past year.

Miss Patel, MP for Witham, said: ‘The victims of these shocking crimes are being failed by the justice system and the very policies that should be protecting them.

Campaigner: Priti Patel, Tory MP for Witham, said: 'We should be putting the victim first'

‘Sexual offenders destroy lives in such a sinister way.

'We should be putting the victim first by ensuring that these dangerous sexual predators are kept off our streets and kept behind bars.’

Overall, more than one in five offenders who commits a serious crime escapes with a caution, which are issued at the discretion of police as a way of sanctioning criminals without going to court.
