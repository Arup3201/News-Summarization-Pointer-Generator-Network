West Ham's Ravel Morrison has joined Cardiff on a three-month loan deal, the player has announced on Twitter.

The 21-year-old former Manchester United midfielder has been out of favour at West Ham in recent months amid well-documented personal issues.

Morrison announced on Twitter on Tuesday afternoon: 'Happy to get a 3 month loan @CardiffCityFC time to start playing some football again.'

He added in another tweet about West Ham, which he later deleted: 'I got no ratings off people in the club not the club it's self (sic) just people in it.'

The England Under-21 international is set to face trial in January over allegations he threatened to throw acid in his former girlfriend's face and have her killed.

He is also accused of threatening to blow up Reah Mansoor's house during an alleged four-year campaign of harassment against her and is alleged to have assaulted the 19-year-old and her mother, Parveen Mansoor, 39, in Salford in the early hours of July 27.

Manchester-born Morrison was considered one of the most talented youngsters to have come out of United for many years during his time at Old Trafford, but he ended up making only three substitute appearances in the League Cup for Sir Alex Ferguson's side and joined West Ham in a £650,000 deal in January 2012.

Morrison has started just 12 Premier League games for the Hammers in more than two-and-a-half years and has had loan spells at Birmingham and QPR during his time in east London.

He has made just two appearances for West Ham this season, against Sheffield United in the Capital One Cup and Southampton in the Premier League.

Morrison could make his debut for managerless Cardiff in the SkyBet Championship at home to Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday.
