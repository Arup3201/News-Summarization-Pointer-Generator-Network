What's lurking in your fridge? Chefs have warned that Britons are storing too much in the chiller after a survey found that we are keeping things like nail varnish and paint in the fridge

It is undoubtedly the best place to keep milk to stop it going sour and you wouldn't want to tuck into a slice of ham if it had been left out in the warmth of the kitchen for too long.

But many homeowners are taking to storing more than just dairy products and meat in the fridge.

A survey by fridge manufacturers Sharp has found that Britons are becoming obsessed with storing items in the fridge that simply don't need to be there, including nail varnish and paint.

Researchers asked 4,000 homeowners what they keep in their fridge and found that a staggering 26 per cent are storing medicines there.

More bizarrely still, six per cent store glue alongside their milk and butter, with a further three per cent keeping nail varnish there and one per cent using the storage space for batteries.

As well as some rather outlandish products being kept in the chiller, Britons are keeping slightly less obvious food stuffs that needn't be kept cool in the fridge and may even damage their shelf lives.

According to top chef Raymond Blanc, storing certain vegetables, fruits and grocery goods can be detrimental to their taste.

He told The Times: 'People keep far too much in their fridge, and it is normally a complete mess.

'They've got into the habit of refrigerating absolutely everything when often there is simply no need.

'We assume a product is always better kept chilled than at ambient temperature, and in the case of protein and dairy that is true, but there are many products that are better kept out.'

According to Blanc, tomatoes shouldn't 
be chilled because it spoils their flavour by damaging the membranes in 
the fruit's walls.

Similarly, citrus fruits shrivel and go tough and potatoes taste is spoiled as their starch turns to sugar.

Although Blanc recommends keeping soft herbs and spinach, both liable to wilt, in the fridge, root vegetables like carrots are best kept in a cool part of the kitchen.

Overcrowding a fridge also leads to more food being wasted, says Irish chef Richard Corrigan, who puts it down to laziness - people are buying too much in one go.

Angela Hartnett, head chef at west London's Michelin-starred Murano restaurantÂ  said that her fridge contains things like jams and chutneys - products that have enough sugar in them to act as natural preservatives.

She believes that part of the problem is manufacturer's over-cautious advice and our obsession with use-by dates.

Top chefs have said that we risk damaging the shelf life and quality of some of our foods by keeping them in the fridge. So what is more at home in the cupboard than the chiller?
