Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel admitted on Friday that three U.S. nuclear missile bases in North Dakota, Wyoming and Montana were so badly managed that they had to share a wrench used to tighten warheads to the business end of Minuteman 3 missiles.

'How did they do it? They did it by federal expressing the one wrench around to each base,' Hagel told reporters Friday morning during a press conference called to introduce new system-wide reforms affecting the nation's entire intercontinental ballistic missile arsenal.

'They were creative and innovative and they made it work. But that is not the way to do it. We now have a wrench for each location. We're going to have two for each location soon.'

The three facilities in question house about 450 nuclear missiles.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told reporters on Friday that America's nuclear missile arsenal had fallen into such chaos that repair crews at three bases had to share a single wrench

Not a joke: Missile crews in three states had to FedEx a tool back and forth – but Hagel said Friday that they each have their own now

The Pentagon's recent reviews concluded that the structure of U.S. nuclear forces is so incoherent that it cannot be properly managed in its current form, and that this problem explains why top-level officials often are unaware of trouble below them. The reviews found a 'disconnect' between what nuclear force leaders say and what they deliver to lower-level troops who execute the missions in the field.

Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work added that the shared hardware was 'a little toolkit to thread the bolt so that the wrenches could attach [to a warhead], and they were being FedExed around as the secretary said.'

'For me, a Marine, that's a metaphor ... for how far things had fallen.'

The near-comical situation arose, Work said, 'because people stopped reporting it. They had reported it over and over and they just worked around it.'

Hagel said a lack of sustained attention and investment in the force had caused America's nuclear warfare system to 'slowly back downhill.'

But 'the good news, he said, 'is there's nothing here that we can't fix. The good news is that none of this has endangered America, Americans, or put our security at risk.'

He added that the Defense Department will boost spending on the nuclear forces by about 10 percent a year for the next five years – an increase of nearly $10 billion – adding there is no problem on this issue the Pentagon can't fix.

'The internal and external reviews I ordered show that a consistent lack of investment and support for our nuclear forces over far too many years has left us with too little margin to cope with mounting stresses,' said Hagel, who was flanked by senior Air Force and Navy officers. 

'The root cause has been a lack of sustained focus, attention, and resources, resulting in a pervasive sense that a career in the nuclear enterprise offers too few opportunities for growth and advancement.'

Online reaction to Hagel's revelation was the digital equivalent of a nation shaking its collective head

Sadly, it wasn't a garden-variety wrench that the Air Force could have found at a Home Depot or a bike shop 

Hagel is ordering top-to-bottom changes in how the nation's nuclear arsenal is managed, vowing to invest billions of dollars more to fix what ails a force beset by leadership lapses, security flaws and sagging morale

Hagel ordered two reviews in February – one by Pentagon officials and a second by outside experts – as a result of a series of Associated Press stories that revealed lapses in leadership, morale, safety and security at the nation's three nuclear Air Force bases.

The good news, Hagel said, 'is there has been no nuclear exchange in the world.'

Acknowledging the years of neglect, which included glaring problems that prompted then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates to fire his top military and civilian Air Force leaders in 2008, Hagel vowed renewed accountability.

'Previous reviews of our nuclear enterprise lacked clear follow-up mechanisms,' he said. 'Recommendations were implemented without the necessary follow-through to assess that they were implemented effectively.'

Hagel added that this time, people will be held accountable to ensure the improvements are done.

Navy Adm. Cecil Haney, the head of U.S. Strategic Command, said the nuclear force has been operating securely.

'You don't see the mushroom cloud or that sort of thing.  We must continue that,' he told reporters.

Hagel's moves, while not dramatic, are designed to get at the core of the problem. 

Among his more significant moves, he authorized the Air Force to put a four-star general in charge of its nuclear forces, according to officials.

The top Air Force nuclear commander currently is a three-star. Lt. Gen. Stephen Wilson is responsible not only for the 450 Minuteman ICBMs but also the nuclear bomber force. Hagel has concluded that a four-star would be able to exert more influence within the Air Force and send a signal to the entire force that the mission is taken seriously, the defense officials said.

Hagel also OK'd a proposal to upgrade the top nuclear force official at Air Force headquarters in the Pentagon from a two-star general to a three-star.

The review's authors, retired Air Force Gen. Larry D. Welch and retired Navy Adm. John C. Harvey Jr., found fault with one of the unique features of life in the nuclear forces. It is called the Personnel Reliability Program, designed to monitor the mental fitness of people to be entrusted with the world's deadliest weapons.

Over time, that program has devolved into a burdensome administrative exercise that detracts from the mission, the authors found. Hagel ordered an overhaul.

Hagel concluded that despite tight Pentagon budgets, billions of dollars more will be needed over the next five years to upgrade equipment. That will include a proposal to replace the Vietnam-era UH-1 Huey helicopter fleet that is part of the security forces at ICBM bases. The Air Force declared them out of date years ago but put available resources into other priorities.

The Navy, which operates nuclear-armed submarines, has had its own problems, including an exam-cheating scandal this year among nuclear reactor training instructors and has suffered from a shortage of personnel.

 America's nuclear weapons system still relies heavily on the Minuteman III missile

When he ordered the reviews, shortly after the Air Force announced it was investigating an exam-cheating ring at one ICBM base and a related drug investigation implicating missile crew members, Hagel was said to be flabbergasted that such misbehavior could be infecting the force.

'He said, 'What is going on here?'' said one senior defense official, who spoke about the review on condition of anonymity.

Hans Kristensen, a nuclear expert with the Federation of American Scientists, said Thursday that while he had not seen the Hagel reviews or heard what actions Hagel was ordering, he was skeptical that it would make much difference.

'Throwing money after problems may fix some technical issues but it is unlikely to resolve the dissolution that must come from sitting in a silo hole in the Midwest with missiles on high alert to respond to a nuclear attack that is unlikely to ever come,' Kristensen said.

A cascade of embarrassments befell the Air Force over the past two years, beginning with an AP story in May 2013 revealing one missile officer's lament of 'rot' inside the force. Another AP story in November disclosed that an independent assessment for the Air Force found signs of 'burnout' and elevated levels of personal misconduct among missile launch crews and missile security forces.

The AP also disclosed last year that four ICBM launch officers were disciplined for violating security rules by opening the blast door to their underground command post while one crew member was asleep.

Just last week the AP disclosed that the Air Force fired two nuclear commanders and disciplined a third, providing evidence that leadership lapses are continuing even as top Air Force officials attempt to bring stability to the ICBM force.

After his Pentagon announcement Hagel was expected to fly to Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota, home of a Minuteman 3 missile unit whose recent setbacks are emblematic of the trouble dogging the broader nuclear force.
