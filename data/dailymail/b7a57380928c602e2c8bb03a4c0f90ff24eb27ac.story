An amateur hypnotist allegedly had sex with a woman after he hypnotized her.

Kevin Christian Geyer, 25, pleaded not guilty to indecent liberties in Benton County Superior Court, Washington on Wednesday - even though his victim claims he  apologized for the alleged attack.

The woman, who has not been identified, had visited Geyer's home in Kennewick several times for hypnotism to help her with problems she was having.

During a visit on June 4, Geyer allegedly put her under a state of hypnosis and told her to block out all of her senses except her hearing, the Tri-City Herald reported.

Denial: Kevin Geyer pleaded not guilty to sexually assaulting a woman he had hypnotized at his home. She says that after their appointment, she had images of him assaulting her and found evidence on her clothes

When he woke her, she was fully clothed.

But she told authorities that she later had vague memories of Geyer sexually assaulting her and found evidence of the assault on her clothes.

She texted him to ask him about the alleged attack and he apologized, police said.

When authorities contacted him, he also admitted to touching her and expressed remorse, according to court documents. 

His charge of indecent liberties stems from him allegedly having sexual contact with a person who is incapable of consent because they are mentally incapacitated or physically helpless.

Geyer's trial will begin in January. He is out of custody but has been ordered to have no contact with the woman for a year.
