Police in a Colorado town where the body of a missing 10-year-old girl was found said Friday that they want to question their teenage suspect, Austin Sigg, in two unsolved child enticement cases.

A sketch developed in the September incidents bears some resemblance to 17-year-old Sigg, who's being held on suspicion of first-degree murder and kidnapping in the death of Jessica Ridgeway, Arvada police spokesman Sgt. Mark Nazaryk said.

The sketch and Sigg's mug shot wasn't an exact match, Nazaryk noted.

Alleged killer: Austin Reed Sigg, 17, was arrested late Tuesday night after Westminster police received a tip that led them to a home near Ketner Lake Open Space

Evidence: Authorities said Sigg's DNA was found on Jessica's backpack

Investigation: Westminster officers pictured Wednesday collecting evidence from the home of Austin Reed Sigg

He also said investigators were 
trying to determine if Sigg had access to a royal blue, four-door sedan 
described by witnesses in both cases.

The September child enticement cases involved a man who tried to lure two boys about the same age as Jessica into a car.

No suspects were identified in those incidents.

Sigg is being held without bail on 
suspicion of murder and kidnapping in the death of Jessica, and 
attempted murder and attempted kidnapping in the case of runner at a 
neighborhood lake in May.

Prosecutors were expected to formally charge 
him next week.

In arguing that Sigg be held without 
bail, prosecutors disclosed that Sigg confessed and that DNA evidence in
the case was overwhelming.

Jessica disappeared three weeks ago 
after leaving her home in the Denver suburb to walk to school. She never
arrived. Her remains were found on October 10.

Yearbooks showed Sigg was a member of the choir in his freshman and sophomore years.

Former schoolmate Sarah Morevec said Sigg had been bullied for having a high voice.

schoolgirl's gruesomely dismembered body was discovered in a park 10 
miles from her home on October 11, six days after she vanished on her 
way to school

Dakota Foster graduated from Standley
Lake in 2011, a year before Sigg left. Foster on Wednesday said he and 
his friends sat at the opposite end of a cafeteria table from Sigg and 
his friends.

'He was really nice and laughed a lot with us and told jokes, and laughed at our jokes,' Foster said.

Foster, 19, said he didn't know Sigg 
well, but 'he used to hang out with a lot of us in what we called the 
goth corner (of the school cafeteria), where all the metal heads were.'

'He wore all black so he fit it,' Foster said. He added he wasn't surprised that Sigg left high school after the 11th grade.

'I know he didn't like his classes very much,' Foster said. 'He always complained about school.'

Neighbor Brooke Olds, 13, said Wednesday she usually saw Sigg alone on a skateboard or scooter.

'He was shy and kept to himself,' she said.

Police said they notified the 
Ridgeway family of the arrest Wednesday morning. Jessica lived in 
Westminster with her mother, Sarah Ridgeway. Jessica's father, Jeremiah 
Bryant, lives in Missouri.

Jessica's great-grandmother Donna 
Moss told Kansas City-area reporters that she feels for Sigg's mother 
but has to fight the rage she has toward Sigg because she knows as a 
Christian she should forgive.

'I think it's all I've got within me to not want to just burn him, and I mean burn him,' she said.

The arrest brought some relief to the
community, where some parents said they were nervous about letting 
their children play outside as authorities searched for Jessica's 
killer.

'Every parent in every Colorado community will rest a little easier 
tonight,' said Gov John Hickenlooper, who has a ten-year-old son, 
Wednesday.

'While we still mourn the death of 
Jessica Ridgeway, we are relieved an arrest has been made and the 
pursuit of justice can continue.'

The Colorado schoolgirl's dismembered body was found six days after she vanished on her way to school.

In the abduction attempt, an 
unidentified young woman was jogging around a lake about a 
half-mile from the Ridgeway home when she was grabbed from behind by a man.

The 
attacker tried to cover her mouth with a chemical-soaked rag but she was
able to escape.

According to The Post, the woman described her attacker as a 
light-skinned Caucasian male between 18 and 30 years of age, 5 feet 6 to
5 feet 8 inches tall with a medium build and brown hair.

The link between the two cases was confirmed just days after police found a tuft of blonde hair a mile away 
from where 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway's body was discovered.

After police were alerted to the 
scene, a grid search was conducted 
while the hair was taken into evidence.

But Westminster police 
investigating the murder initially dismissed claims that the hair was a 
definite clue in the case.

A spokesman told the Denver Post last 
week that there was nothing to suggest the hair has anything to do with 
Jessica or was even human.

Another recent clue in the tragic 
investigation was a wooden
cross which police believe belonged to Jessica's killer, describing it as a 'pivotal piece of evidence' in the case.

Pictures of the cross, which is 1.5 
inches tall by 1 inch wide cross and has a hole at the top so it can be worn as a
necklace, were released by Westminster Police Department on Friday.

At about 5pm on Wednesday October 10, 
dozens of officers flooded into Pattridge Park in Arvada, combing the 
foot of a hill, walking no more than five feet apart, reportedly working
on a credible tip.

The focus of their search was an 
abandoned cabin that appeared to have been part of a former mining 
operation. The area is now a popular park where neighbors often come to 
hike, ride bicycles and fly model airplanes.

Police said they did not suspect Jessica's parents, who are divorced and fighting a custody battle 
over her, had any involvement in the disappearance.

The U.S. Marshals Service, immigration
officials and state Department of Corrections have been reviewing registered
sex offenders in the area.

During the heartbreaking investigation, authorities have received more than 
1,500 tips from the public, searched more than 500
homes and gone through over 1,000 vehicles hunting for clues.
