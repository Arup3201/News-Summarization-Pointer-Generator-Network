Royal Descent by Black Hearted Press has been slammed as 'sick' by critics for its violent representation of Royal characters

A Scottish publishing house has produced what has been described as the UK's 'most controversial comic' in which characters based on the Royal Family fight to the death in front of an audience.

Royal Descent, by Glasgow-based Black Hearted Press, graphically depicts how the characters must kill each other in order to win the game.

The first part of the trilogy which will be released next month, has been slammed by comic fans with critics describing its content as 'sick'.

With striking similarities to fiction series the Hunger Games, and Japanese film, Battle Royale, Royal Descent sees its characters banished to a remote island in the Outer Hebrides.

There, Princes Willard and Hadley fight to the death alongside characters such as Catherine, Duchess of Oxford and Prince Cedric.

Though the team behind the work admitted changing characters' names to avoid being in 'poor taste',  it is plain to see where they drew inspiration.

Characters such as Queen Eleanora II and Princess Agatha Princess, for example, seem to bear a striking resemblance to real-life royals, Queen Elizabeth and Princess Anne.

The action begins in the wake of an environmental disaster in which a BSE outbreak causes the death of all livestock in Britain.

In protest, the public banishes the Royals to the island where their fight for survival is broadcast on television.

In order to escape the remote island's prison, the characters fight individually and are separated into heroes and villains.

One particularly controversial storyline concerns a violent conflict between Prince Willard and Prince Hadley.

While the former tries to make his way off the island, Prince Hadley is hell bent on taking revenge against members of the family he believes were complicit in his mother's death.

The publication has been slammed by enthusiasts who deem its content distasteful.

The story begins with the announcement of an outbreak of disease which has killed all of Britain's livestock

One writer who wished to remain anonymous said: 'There is no way the British people would allow this to happen. Why waste
your time on a book that no one wants to read? Horrible idea.'

Another said: 'I hope they lock you up and throw away the key, the worst kind of sensationalist crap!'

Writers at Black Heart Press admitted the work was controversial but described it as: 'a blackly comic and disturbing look at modern media, class and privilege.

One of its creators, John Farman said: 'I personally believe this is possibly the most controversial comic book to ever come out of the United Kingdom.

'In the British tradition of storytelling there is a sense of satire and it’s in line with that'.

Artist John Howard said: 'We’ve gone for analogues rather than accuracy. The Royals in the book are ordinary people with a slightly more heroic proportion.

'Besides the biographical newspaper strips that have marked anniversaries in the media, this is the first depiction of the Royals in a futuristic, dramatic and perilous setting.'

Mr Farman added: 'I remind people that this is a comic and that I deal with fantasy.

'I’ve had some negative reactions, which I think is interesting. But with that kind of feedback, I feel I’m doing my job.

'I think it’s very important to 
understand that with such a controversial subject matter that criticism 
is totally valid, in the same way criticism of a film or novel is 
totally valid.'

A spokeswoman for the Royal Family said: 'We do not comment on books or articles about the Royal Family.'

The first part of the comic trilogy will be released on 6 November.
