A husband and wife undertakers scammed elderly victims out of almost £23,000 after convincing them to sign up for pre-paid funeral schemes. 

Gary Trevett, 54, and Fiona Langdown, 53, preyed on nine victims after agreeing to make funeral arrangements, then betraying their trust.

Their con made customers believe they had paid for a complete service which would take care of their funerals - but the cash was then used to save the couple's failing business.

The pair sold pre-paid plans on the basis that the customer's payment believed to be placed securely into one of two trust funds.

But Southampton Crown Court heard that between October 2009 and March 2012, money was siphoned off to save the couple's failing business.

The con was only uncovered when former employee Linda Connolly started looking through the accounts at Langdown and Trevett Independent Funeral Directors in Woolston, Southampton, after taking over the failing business in July 2012. 

The full extent of their con was revealed after Langdown, of Southampton, was found guilty of defrauding four victims and handling the stolen cash of another three.

She provided literature to some of the customers and helped Trevett to retain some of the money, by receiving it into their bank account and concealing the fact that it was never paid into the trust fund. 

But it was Trevett who would befriend customers and spend hours helping them to plan funeral details. 

Victims described him as a 'charmer' who they felt they could trust and said they were left feeling gullible and angry. 

Trevett, also from Southampton, had already admitted defrauding all nine people - including a friend, who was deteriorating quickly with dementia. 

Investigations revealed that when customers were handing over money to pay into secure funeral trusts, it was instead being pocketed by the business.

The court was told how Langdown and Trevett became equal partners in the business, based in Southampton, in April 2005.

Langdown put in the money with her then-husband while Trevett brought in his experience as an undertaker but she divorced and went on to marry Trevett in 2012. 

One of the pair's victims, Kathleen Crook, 74, from Netley Abbey, Hampshire, paid the pair £2,485 to make sure her husband John had the funeral he deserves, should the worst happen.

But instead she has been left penniless and on antidepressants due to Trevett's betrayal.

When she started questioning the plan Trevett reassured her, even kissing her on the cheek, but soon the devastating truth was revealed - all the money was gone.

She said: 'I am a bit gullible. But I am an old lady and I just didn't think anyone could do something like this. He seemed such a nice little man. I really trusted him.' 

She added: 'I am absolutely devastated and feel so betrayed. All that I had is gone.

'It is such a wicked thing to do. For me justice will never be done because I won't get my money back.'

Langdown told the court that she had no knowledge of her husband conning people, but jurors did not believe her.

She was cleared of charges relating to two victims. 

Detective Sergeant Ricky Dhanda, from Hampshire Constabulary, has been determined to get justice for the victims.

He said: 'Trevett and Langdown preyed on their victims when they were at their most vulnerable.

'They betrayed the trust of the elderly who had so carefully saved and planned for when they were no longer here, to spare their own loved ones the heartache.

'The manner in which their trust was manipulated for financial gain is a sickening thought.'

Langdown and Trevett will be sentenced next month.
