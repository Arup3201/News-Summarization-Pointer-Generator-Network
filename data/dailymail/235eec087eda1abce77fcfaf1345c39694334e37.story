A mob of vengeful England supporters last night attacked Italy fans celebrating their win in Britain's most Italian town.

Up to 150 thugs - angered by Roy Hodgson's side's exit - confronted jubilant 'Azzuri' fans in Bedford, where one in five residents is Italian - the highest proportion anywhere in the country.

Women and children fled in fear as the yobs began began smashing up cars and restaurants as England yet again 
crashed out of the European championships on penalties.

During the confrontation, one man was assaulted. Four people were arrested amid the violence, one for assault and three for criminal damage.

The showdown took place after a cavalcade of celebrating Italians, many of whom are children of immigrants recruited to brick factories in the 1950s, excitedly drove their cars through the town.

As more than 1,200 England supporters spilled out of pubs around the town centre following the defeat shortly after 10.30pm, most headed home.

But hundreds of the angry fans chose to protest in the High Street, which police cordoned off and swelled with officers to prevent thugs heading to Russel Park, where Italy fans were celebrating.

Unfortunately, around 150 yobs broke 
off and headed for The Embankment, an area nicknamed Little Italy 
because of its association with immigrants from the country.

Bedford’s Italian community dates back to the post-war period when a building boom created a shortage of labour in the Bedford brickworks industry.

With too few British workers to produce the materials needed, employers began encouraging workers from the impoverished villages in southern Italy to emigrate.

One firm, the Marston Valley Brick Company, established a recruitment office in Naples in 1951 and by the 1960s more than 7,500 Italians had arrived in the town. 

Among them was Felice Facchiano, pictured above loading bricks from the kiln onto a lorry in 1955.

As most of  the immigrants were single men, their wives and children began joining them - and today the community numbers 20,000.

The town of 100,000 people has the third highest Italian population in Britain, behind London and Glasgow. It has the highest proportion of immigrants from the southern European nation.

And up to 30 per cent of the town’s people are thought to have at least some Italian descent.The Midland Road area, which led to the railway station, nicknamed Via Roma and the Embankment, which has many Italian restaurants and shops, is known as Little Italy.

The area by the River Great Ouse features Italian
bars, restaurants and social clubs, as well as delis and grocery shops.

The violence began in The Embankment 
when England fans spotted an Italian cavalcade. One Audi had its windows
smashed and a moped was knocked over, another car was also damaged.

Superintendent Mark Turner, who was 
responsible for the policing operation last night, said: 'Sadly a well 
behaved build-up to the game was marred by approximately 15 minutes of 
sporadic disorder in Bedford High Street and the Embankment after the 
penalty shoot out.

'A crowd spilt onto the High Street, which was closed in the interests of public safety.

'Unfortunately a group of 
approximately 150 people broke away and ran towards the Embankment 
straight into grid-locked traffic as many Italian fans had formed a 
cavalcade of vehicles to celebrate and it was at this point some 
vehicles were attacked by the crowd.'

He added: 'It is always a shame when 
the majority of well behaved supporters are let down by the actions of a
mindless minority and while order was quickly restored this was 
undoubtedly an extremely unpleasant situation for people trying to leave
the area sensibly and particularly for those stuck in their cars.'

The first wave of migrants came from impoverished southern Italy moved to the town in the 1950s for 
jobs in a local brick works to help rebuild the area after the Second World War.

Around 20,000 Italians now live in 
Bedford,which has a population of around 100,000. This means the town 
has the biggest Italian population by proportions.

In numbers, Bedford is behind London 
and Glasgow, which each have 39,000 and 35,000 Italian-born residents, 
according to the latest census data.

The community in Bedford have celebrated football victories for years by 
driving through the town centre waving flags and blaring their horns.

Police, anticipating problems between, had arranged to put more officers on duty for yesterday's clash.

Before the match, Twitter user @KillHollywood tweeted on June 19: 'Bedford is like 40% Italian Mafia, so England vs Italy should be interesting here.'

Police were reviewing
CCTV images today to establish what other offences may have been committed and 
identify where possible those responsible.

Fans watching the match in other towns across Luton and Bedfordshire did so without trouble and no issues were reported.
