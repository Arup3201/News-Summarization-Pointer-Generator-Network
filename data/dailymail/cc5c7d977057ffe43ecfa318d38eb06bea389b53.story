A glass eye stolen from a corpse by Jimmy Savile, which he then made into a trophy necklace, was sold at a charity auction for £75 shortly after his death.

It is believed to have been worn by the paedophile DJ as he co-presented the final episode of Top of the Pops at BBC Television Centre in 2006, where he also groped a child. 

An official NHS report revealed yesterday Savile had bragged about stealing glass eyes from the sockets of the dead at Leeds General Infirmary, and had them made into rings and medallions.

Auction: This necklace belonging to Jimmy Savile with a glass eye at its centre was sold for £75 at a charity auction shortly after his death

TV outing: The auction said that the necklace was worn on Top of the Pops and believed to have been when he co-presented its final episode in 2006, where he also groped a child

He also said that he enjoyed interfering with the bodies and one witness told investigators that he had been seen having sex with a corpse.

Before he died he asked that his possessions be sold to raise money for his charity, and the necklace with a glass eye at the centre sold for £75 on July 30 2012, according to the Popbitch website.

On the same day his 2002 Rolls-Royce which has the number plate JS 247 went for £130,000, and helped towards the £320,000 total raised by his foundation.

Among the other 548 lots was Sir Jimmy's famous Jim'll Fix It red chair, a £12,000 gold and diamond encrusted Rolex watch, cigars - and the odd lame tracksuit.

The scale of Savile's crimes was never exposed until later that year, so dozens attended the Leeds auction happy to buy his possessions.

The chilling glass eye necklace's past only became clear yesterday when the mass of NHS reports into his crimes published yesterday revealed how Savile
 boasted about having sex with corpses and had jewellery made from glass
 eyes he removed from their bodies.

The sick 
paedophile also gloated to others that he enjoyed 'posing' with the 
corpses and said that he would 'wheel them around' at night at Leeds 
General Infirmary.

Sick: New evidence revealed that Savile abused the dead and stole their glass eyes and turned them into rings like these (pictured on his left hand). His victims were aged between five and 75

Investigators discovered the late DJ and Top of the Pops presenter claimed at least 103 victims aged between five and 75.

Starstruck NHS workers allowed Savile free reign to sexually abuse patients and hospital staff 'didn't want to hear or believe' what his young victims were saying, the report said.

They detailed his 50 year reign of terror at 28 institutions including Leeds, Broadmoor and Stoke Mandeville hospital.

One witness told investigators that Savile revealed the origin of his 'gross, big silver rings' when she remarked on them.

He said: 'D'you know what they are? They are glass eyes from dead bodies in Leeds Mortuary where I work and I love working there, and I wheel the dead bodies around at night and I love that.' 

Another, unconnected witness - who was employed at the hospital - added: 'I do remember seeing this ring he had on that looked like an eyeball and - and I must've mentioned it to him.

'He said: 'It's made from the eyeball of a dead friend.'' 

Savile's Rolls-Royce Corniche which he nicknamed 'The Beast' sold for £130,000 at a charity auction in Leeds - raising £320,000 in 2012

The DJ’s Highland suits went for £280, left, while a 
Scottish shepherd's crook, right, estimated to sell for between £30 and 
£60 went for £380

Savile's trademark cigars  were also  sold along with other smoking paraphernalia from his homes

Another, unconnected witness - who was employed at the hospital - added: 'I do remember seeing this ring he had on that looked like an eyeball and - and I must've mentioned it to him.

'He said: 'It's made from the eyeball of a dead friend.'' 

A former nurse at Broadmoor Hospital said Savile told her about his appalling activities in Leeds.

He said he would 'muck about' posing dead bodies of men and women together before taking photographs.

She said: 'I was a little bit upset because I had no concept, in those days, of - while I'd heard of necrophilia ... but I didn't understand what it meant.' 

The nurse added that Savile said he sexually assaulted the bodies as well, something he dubbed 'garamoosh' - a reference to oral sex.  

A former patient at Barnet General Hospital in London said nurses told her in 1983 that Savile 'liked to have sex with dead bodies'.
