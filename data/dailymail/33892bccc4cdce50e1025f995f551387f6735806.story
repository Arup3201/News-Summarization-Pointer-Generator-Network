They have eluded explorers, hunters and scientists who have been searching the Himalayan mountains for the mysterious yeti for over a century.

Now it seems we are no closer to knowing what creature lies behind the mysterious sightings and footprints that have led to the legend of the Abominable Snowman.

A key piece of evidence that suggested many of the sightings were due to an unknown type of bear living in the Himalaya has now been ruled out.

This footprint taken by British explorer Eric Shipton in 1954 is regarded as one of the best pieces of evidence for the existence of a yeti and new research on hair samples shows that the mystery is far from being solved

Biologists used DNA analysis to examine claims that hair samples attributed to yetis appeared to belong to a scientifically undiscovered species of bear.

Instead they have found that the DNA in the hair samples has degraded making it impossible to attribute them to any species of bear.

The
 first accounts of Yetis emerged before the 19th century from Buddhists 
who believed that the creature inhabited the Himalayas.

They
 depicted the mysterious beast as having similarities to an ape and 
carrying a large stone as a weapon while making a whistling sound.

The
 term Abominable Snowman was developed in 1921 following a book by 
Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Howard-Bury called Mount Everest The 
Reconnaissance.

Popular 
interest in creature gathered pace in early 20th century as tourists 
began making their own trips to the region to try and capture the Yeti. 
They reported seeing strange markings in the snow.

The
 Daily Mail led a trip called the the Snowman Expedition in 1954 to 
Everest. During the trip mountaineering leader John Angelo Jackson 
photographed ancient paintings of Yetis and large footprints in the 
snow.

A number of hair 
samples were also found that were believed to have come from a Yeti 
scalp.

British
 mountaineer Don Whillans claimed to have witnessed a creature when 
scaling Annapurna in 1970. He said that while searching for a campsite 
he heard some odd cries which his guide attributed to a Yeti's call. 
That night, he saw a dark shape moving near his camp. 

The researchers conclude, however, that from the colour and shape of the hair samples, they were likely to have come from common Himalayan brown bears rather than an unknown species of bear.

This means that the identity of the species behind yeti sightings is still a mystery. 

Dr Eliécer Gutiérrez, an evolutionary biologist at the Smithsonian Institution, said one of the hair samples had apparently come from a bear that had been shot by hunters.

He said: 'We have concluded that there is no reason to believe that the two samples came from anything other than Brown Bears.

'What strikes us as odd is that an “experienced hunter”, who was very familiar with the Brown Bear, could mistake the animal that he had shot for anything other than a bear of some sort and, specifically, for a “yeti”.

'Corroboration and documentation of, as well as other information concerning, the anecdote of this bear being shot by the hunter and the subsequent history of the hair that was saved would be most welcome.'

In 2014 Professor Bryan Sykes, a geneticist at the University of Oxford, found that DNA extracted two samples of 'yeti' hair from the Himalaya were a 100 per cent match with a 40,000 year old fossil polar bear but not to modern species of polar bear.

However, subsequent analysis by researchers from the University of Copenhagen found that the hair was not from a polar bear.

Professor Sykes and his colleagues maintained, however, that the hair samples must be from an otherwise unknown species of bear living in the Himalaya.

Although no DNA match was found the researchers say it is likely yeti hair samples came from a brown bear

Now Dr Gutiérrez and Dr Ronald Pine, a zoologist at the University of Kansas, have found that the DNA from the samples cannot be assigned to any species of bear.

Writing in the journal ZooKeys, they said: 'The molecular data obtained and analyzed by Sykes are not informative enough to suggest the possibility that a taxonomically unrecognized type of bear exists in the Himalayas.

'We emphasize that no evidence has ever been presented to suggest that an unknown bear species occurs in the Himalayas

As part of their study, Dr Gutiérrez and Dr Pine examined how gene sequences can reveal the relationships between the six present-day species of bears.

They found one sequence from an Asian Black Bear from Japan indicated that it was not closely related to the mainland members of that species.

Professor Sykes insisted that the findings from the new study did not invalidate his own findings.

He said: 'What mattered most to our project was that these two hairs were definitely not from unknown primates. 

'The explanation by Gutierez and Pine might be right, or it might not be. 

'The only way forward, as I have repeatedly said, is to find a living bear that matches the 12S RNA and and study fresh material from it. 

'Which involves getting off your butt, not an activity I usually associate with desk-bound molecular taxonomists.' 

Last year, in what was the first serious scientific study of the abominable snowman for 50 years, Professor Bryan Sykes from the University of Oxford analysed 30 samples of hair.

The hairs had supposedly been shed by yetis, or their bigfoot cousins, and were part of museum and private collections from around the world.

Twenty eight of the hairs were genetic matches to known animals from bears to racoons, horses and cows. But two did not fit the mould. 

Their DNA matched that recovered from a 40,000-year-old polar bear fossil.

One hair was reddish brown and found in a Yeti nest in a bamboo forest in Bhutan, ten years ago.

The second was golden brown and taken from a Yeti in Ladakh on the Tibet-India border 40 years ago. 

But new research suggests Professor Sykes's findings were in fact down to an error in analysing the data.

Researchers Ross Barnett, from the University of Copenhagen, and Ceiridwen Edwards from the University of Oxford looked at the same hair samples that led Professor Sykes to make his bold claim. 

They proposed that the previously unexplained samples come from the Himalayan bear - a sub-species of the brown bear that lives in the higher reaches of the Himalayas, in remote, mountainous areas of Pakistan, Nepal, Tibet, Bhutan and India.

The latest research, however, concludes that it is difficult to attribute the DNA to any species of bear.
