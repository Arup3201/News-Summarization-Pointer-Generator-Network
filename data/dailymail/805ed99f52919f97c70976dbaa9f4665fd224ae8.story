The Final MIC wrap party in New YorkÂ  last week must have been a big one - neither me or Jamie have much of a recollection of what happened which must be a good sign.

Anyone who was there please tweet any details to @spencergeorgem so that we can piece the night together.

But you know you've had a good party when you check your phone the next day and there's a shot of you in a swimming pool with a guy playing a sousaphone.

At least, I'm looking in good nick with my kit off (thanks to Forza T5 supplements).

Anyway, back in the UK finally and ignoring the jet lag I went straight out clubbing. Tuesday night is the new Friday in London (well for summer at least) and Boujis club in South Kensington was packed.

I loved NYC but it was great to be back. The club was full with beautiful people - and there were quite a few women coming up to welcome me back to London with a kiss. Which was nice.

I also hit the Secret Garden Party - it's a music festival near Cambridge, a boutique younger version of Glastonbury. I went with Jamie Laing and it was serious back to basics after the luxury of New York living. We were definitely not Glamping and opted for a basic canvas tent - no luxury yurt for us!

However, we managed to slighly bale out of our accommodation and make some very good new friends in a neighbouring tent.

In the meantime we've had some face painting done courtesy of some lovely people from London Zoo. By the way before some wag makes a wisecrack, I've been painted as tiger not a cheetah.

Lots of Love, Spen.

Wild boys: Jamie had their faces painted courtesy of London Zoo

Spencer is firmly back in British soil

However he made sure his final NYC bash went out with a bang

He ended up in the pool with a jazz musician and remembers little of it

Spencer is already back to his old tricks with the ladies of London
