A woman has been arrested after allegedly leaving her two young children alone in her car while she performed oral sex on her boyfriend.

Police claim they swooped on Princess Marks, 25, as she pleasured the man in his vehicle in a store parking lot in Lake Charles, Louisiana, following a report of children left unattended in an SUV.

Officers say Marks admitted she had been unable to see the children, aged seven and five, or her SUV from her boyfriend's vehicle.
