A couple who adopted triplets and then fell pregnant with twins after thinking they could not conceive have revealed their hectic daily routine.

Speaking over the sound of babies' cries, Sarah and Andy Justice appeared on the Today show on Thursday to introduce their adorable brood and explain how an army of helpers gets them through.

The couple, from Tulsa, Oklahoma said the children work through 84 bottles and 300 diapers a week - although as soon as they finish cleaning up one, there is another crying for a change.

They set the babies - eight-week-old twins Abigail and Andrew and nine-month-old triplets Joel, Hannah and Elizabeth - side-by-side in high chairs for meal times and coordinate their bed times.

It means very little sleep for their parents though - just three hours a day, and sometimes not consecutively, Mr Justice said.

'It is overwhelming and it was more than a little ironic' to fall pregnant after adopting the triplets, he said, adding that he thinks God must have a sense of humor.

Mrs Justice added that the babies were a daily challenge - but there was nothing they would change about their lives.

'My husband says all we do is babies, everything else in life has pretty
 much stopped,' she said.

'But it was something we've wanted so badly 
that we love it. It’s not to say it's not a lot of work and we're not 
tired a lot but it’s great. We just really love having these children.'

'Blessed': The couple said they are getting through on 3 hours of sleep a day - although it's not consecutively

They've also developed tricks to cope with the babies, such as painting their toenails different colors to tell them apart, or placing bows in different positions on their heads - as on display on Thursday.

The couple also credited family, friends and church members with helping them out and donated hundreds of diapers, meaning they haven't had to buy a single one.

The Justice family grew from two to seven in less than a year.

After struggling to conceive, the Justices went to see a specialist who told them IVF would cost them up to $60,000 and they'd still have just a 10 per cent chance of getting pregnant.

So, they told Tulsa World, they decided to adopt, and after an arduous time they were matched with a soon-to-be mother. However, when Sarah took the birth mother for an ultrasound, the doctor had a surprise - not one but three babies were on the way.

Introduction: The Today show hosts had their hands full as they met the five babies on Thursday

The babies were born premature but 
healthy nine months ago, and were still in neonatal intensive care when 
Sarah and Andy had their second surprise. Sarah was pregnant.

Two months later, at a sonogram to find out the sex of the new baby, Sarah called Andy.

'One is a boy,' she said.

'One!?' he exclaimed.

He had in fact been joking that they would probably have twins, but never for a minute thought it would actually happen.

'That'll teach me to keep my mouth shut,' he told Tulsa World, laughing.

On Thursday, Sarah told the Today show: 'I was shocked and a bit overwhelmed because I got to thinking, added it up and I’m like, wow, if they go to term we're about five babies in eight months.

'But we were really excited because it was something we’ve been dreaming of and longing for for years.'

Abigail and Andrew were born healthy and are now eight weeks old.

Andy
 believes the twins may not have even come along had the adoption not 
panned out so well and taken away the stress they'd been under.

'We've been very, very blessed,' Andy said.

No regrets: Sarah said even if they knew they'd have their own biological children, they'd never give up their triplets, pictured
