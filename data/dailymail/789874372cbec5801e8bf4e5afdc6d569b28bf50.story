The Duchess of Cambridge was once again flying the flag for British fashion in New York today in a cerise pink Mulberry coat.

But anyone aspiring to emulate the royal's look will be disappointed to learn that the design, from the current autumn/winter 2014 collection, has already sold out online.

The £1,500 double-breasted wool-silk garment was just roomy enough to accommodate Kate's five-month baby bump, and was no doubt tailored to fit perfectly.

In the pink: The Duchess of Cambridge wore a £1,500 cerise coat by Mulberry on her visit to the 9/11 Memorial this morning

Trendsetter: The Duchess of Cambridge was later given a tour of the National September Eleventh Memorial Museum. Her coat has been such a hit with fashion fans, it has already sold out

Unlike yesterday's Goat coat, there was no need to drop the hemline which already fell below the knee. And the bold hue was a welcome burst of colour on a bleak and rainy morning at the 9/11 Memorial. 

Given the rain, the Duchess wisely wore her hair tied back in a ponytail, minimising any potential for frizz.

The look was completed by black opaque tights and the same black suede heels she has worn for most of her New York engagements.

Once inside the National September Eleventh Memorial Museum, Kate removed her coat to reveal the black high-neck dress she had been wearing underneath - the Vanessa style from Seraphine's current collection - with her Cartier Trinity necklace. 

Sellout: The wool-silk coat was only available to buy in the UK and has already sold out online

Also a British label, Seraphine specialises in maternity wear and also created the custom plum tweed coat worn by the Duchess on her arrival into New York City.

Last night, however, Kate paid tribute to her U.S. hosts in a coat by New York designer Tory Burch. Incidentally, the $595 silver boucle Bettina design has also sold out 

She teamed the coat with a pair of J Crew's black Toothpick jeans and high heels for a reception for the Tusk Trust, where she met Hillary and Chelsea Clinton, then a Brooklyn Nets game at the Barclays Center, where she and Prince William met LeBron James and enjoyed a chat courtside with Beyonce and Jay Z.

Today saw the Duke and Duchess complete a jam-packed schedule. Following the 9/11 Memorial and museum, they visited two of New York City’s leading youth organizations – The Door and The CityKids Foundation – to see the work they do with disadvantaged children.

Lunch was a reception with members of the British arts community - which again allowed us to see Kate's Seraphine dress and Cartier necklace.

This afternoon they will visit the Empire State Building, and this evening they will be the guests of honour at a fundraising dinner at the Metropolitan Museum of Art benefiting their 600-year-old alma mater, the University of St Andrews.

The couple will catch a late flight back to the UK after dinner that will see them reunited with Prince George by morning.
