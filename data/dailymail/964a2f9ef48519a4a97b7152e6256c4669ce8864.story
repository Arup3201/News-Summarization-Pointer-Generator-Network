The RSPCA has been plunged into fresh controversy after a militant campaigner seeking election to its ruling council likened the plight of livestock to that of Jews in the Holocaust.

Peta Watson-Smith, 61, is one of six candidates fighting to fill five vacancies on the charity’s council, which contributes to its ‘effective leadership and direction’.

The vote is pivotal for the RSPCA’s future because the council intends to appoint a new chief executive early next year to replace the combative Gavin Grant, who resigned because of poor health.

His tenure saw the charity at war with farms and hunters, while the number of prosecutions it launched almost doubled – leading to accusations the charity was overzealous and politically and financially motivated.

Mrs Watson-Smith said eating less meat and dairy produce would benefit animals and be better for people’s health, welfare and psychology.

She told The Times: ‘I don’t think people always appreciate what is the holocaust going on behind closed doors. You talk about the Jews. This probably sounds like animal rights, but if you recognise animals as sentient beings, why are we treating them so abysmally on farms?’

The comments drew condemnation from countryside campaigners and Jewish groups, who branded the comparison ‘offensive’ and accused her of ‘trivialising’ the suffering of millions.

Mrs Watson-Smith, who lives in Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, has already urged the RSPCA to drop Freedom Food, the accreditation programme promoting higher farm welfare standards which is backed by the chef Jamie Oliver.

She says the money should be spent on prosecuting farmers and, if elected, she would like the RSPCA to encourage the public to ‘follow a wholly plant-based diet’. She supports Hillside, a sanctuary for animals ‘rescued from the farming industry’ and wants to ban the Grand National.

Alan Aziz, director of the Zionist Federation, said: ‘No one who fully understands the all-encompassing evil of the Holocaust, and its systematic programme of genocide, could ever seriously compare it to the treatment – no matter how bad – of farm animals.

‘While everyone is entitled to their own views about the morality and efficiency of how we source our food, that can never be an acceptable reason to trivialise the memory of the millions of Jews and others who were deliberately exterminated by the Nazi regime.’

Tim Bonner, of the Countryside Alliance, added: ‘This is the language of extremists which would be offensive to anyone who isn’t obsessed with an animal rights agenda – particularly those who lived and suffered through the Holocaust.

In her controversial rant, Peta Watson-Smith, 61, also said eating less meat and dairy produce would benefit animals and be better for people¿s health, welfare and psychology

'A creeping political and animal rights agenda has been apparent in the RSPCA for a number of years now and further moves towards militancy are not going to improve its image to the public.’

Another candidate, Joseph Piccioni, also supports Hillside and was nominated by Mrs Watson-Smith. Mr Piccioni helped to persuade the charity to withdraw from Crufts because of concerns about pedigree dog breeding.

One candidate seen as a moderate voice is Christopher Laurence, the charity’s former chief vet and an adviser on dog-breeding legislation aimed at reducing the number of irresponsibly bred puppies.

Asked about the effect of electing Mrs Watson-Smith and Mr Piccioni, Mr Laurence said: ‘Every time there is an election, we change the balance of the council. If those two were elected and I was not, that clearly would make a difference.’

Polling results for the unpaid positions are due to be announced at a charity meeting this month.

In December, the RSPCA hired a lawyer to carry out a £50,000 review of its controversial prosecutions policy following months of criticism, including its decision to bring a £330,000 private prosecution against the Heythrop Hunt in David Cameron’s Oxfordshire constituency.
