Humiliated: Spain's players react after they were beaten 5-1 by Holland on Friday night 

One to watch: Jorge Valdivia

Alexis Sanchez and Arturo Vidal tend to hog the limelight for Chile, while the good work of players like 30-year-old Valdivia goes unnoticed. Watch the playmaker in action and look at the way he moves with the ball and switches possession and you would think he was Spanish. He’ll need to be at his best to match Xavi, Xabi Alonso and Sergio Busquets though.

Key clash: Javi Martinez vs Alexis Sanchez

If, as expected, Bayern Munich's Javi Martinez comes in for the out-of-sorts Gerard Pique alongside Sergio Ramos at the heart of Spain's defence then he will have his work cut out keeping the lively Alexis Sanchez quiet. Martinez, a central midfielder by trade, will have to cope with the lightning pace of Barcelona forward if Spain are to stay in the tournament.

Best bet:

Chile’s Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal to score at any time — 4/1

Head-to-head record:

Played 10, Spain Wins 8, Draws 2
