Adam Le Fondre is keen to get back among the goals having joined Bolton on loan from Cardiff until the end of the season.

The 28-year-old striker joined the Bluebirds from Reading on a three-year-deal during the summer but has managed just three goals in 23 league appearances this season.

Having joined Neil Lennon's in-form Bolton for the rest of the campaign, Le Fondre said on Twitter: 'Looking forward to kick starting my season with Bolton, like to thank all the Cardiff City staff and fans for all the support!

The former Reading striker revealed he is looking to 'get back enjoying football and scoring goals'

'Can't wait to get started next Saturday against Wolves! Such a shame I'm unable to play against Rotherham tomorrow away.

'Didn't quite happen for me at Cardiff looking to get back enjoying football and scoring goals and come back better for it next season. 

The striker becomes the ninth player to leave the Cardiff City Stadium since Russell Slade replaced Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as manager in October.
