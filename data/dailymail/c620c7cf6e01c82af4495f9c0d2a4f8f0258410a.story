Diego Costa has followed in the footsteps of fellow Premier League striker Mario Balotelli by having trouble  putting a bib over his training top.

The Spain international, who was taking part in Chelsea's pre-match training session ahead of their encounter against Schalke in the Champions League, had to be given help by team-mate Mohamed Salah.

Balotelli has struggled with the easy task of putting a bib on during his two spells in the Premier League.

His first 'bib incident' came in 2011 when he had to get a member of Manchester City's coaching staff to help him before a Europa League tie against Dynamo Kiev.

And the second occasion came during his first training session following his £16million summer move to Liverpool.

The two strikers have been worlds apart when it comes to impressing at their new clubs as Costa has netted 11 times for Chelsea while Balotelli has just two goals to his name.
