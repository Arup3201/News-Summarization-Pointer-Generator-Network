Two New Jersey elementary school students made a ghastly discovery earlier this month - the breakfast bagels they bought at their school cafeteria were, in fact, blood-stained.

NJ.com reports two Central Avenue elementary school students in the Borough of Madison made the upsetting find Jan. 9, although it wasn't clear from reports if they had, indeed, taken a bite of the besmirched food.

The two students, nevertheless, did reportedly complain to the school's cafeteria staff after seeing the blood-stained bagels - and it was later determined that a lunch lady had cut herself while slicing them.

Pomptonian Food Services, which provides cafeteria services to the Madison school district, later said the employee had used a knife to cut the bagels, rather than a bagel guillotine, according to NJ.com.

The employee, who was fired the same day as the bagel brouhaha after 14 years of service with Pomptonian, did not report the accident - but kept on cutting bagels.

'Pomptonian's dedication to safety and well being has always been our highest priority,' Kathy Penna, director of client services for Pomptonian Food Services, told NJ.com.

'We constantly train our workers and reinforce that training. This employee disregarded all of the training sessions that she had received.'

Patch reports that Pomptonian president Mark Vidovich told parents and administrators at a school board meeting Tuesday the remaining 10 bagels were pulled, but at least 16 other bagels, which could have been affected, were sold that day.

Vidovich reportedly said the employee voluntarily agreed to a blood test to calm parents' concerns.

Vidovich told Patch he has seen the results, and there do not appear to be health concerns about which the district would need to notify parents, according to the report.
