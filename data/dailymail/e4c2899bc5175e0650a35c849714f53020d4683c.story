A wild-eyed and disheveled Shia LaBeouf was seen chasing a homeless man around Manhattan's Theater District hours before his arrest for disorderly conduct on Thursday.

Crowds of baffled bystanders witnessed LaBeouf racing through traffic in broad daylight after a man who didn't appear to know who he was. It seemed the actor wanted either a bag of McDonald's food or a baseball cap that the man had. The actor repeatedly said: 'It's me, Shia.'

The 28-year-old former child star was released by police today after being escorted out of a Broadway theater for allegedly slapping actors, smoking inside and yelling obscenities later on Thursday night.

An erratic Shia LaBeouf gets in a confrontation with a homeless man hours before his arrest on Thursday night around 6.30pm in Manhattan's Theater District

Some witnesses said the 28-year-old actor appeared to chase down the homeless man for a bag of McDonald's food - others claimed he was after a baseball cap that he believed belonged to him

Three hours after this photo was taken, LaBeouf was arrested at a Broadway performance of Cabaret for allegedly being disorderly, slapping the actors' behinds and smoking inside

The
 actor left a Midtown court appearance on Friday morning wearing the same ripped blue T-shirt, skinny jeans and boots as the night before. He had appeared before the judge with a Legal Aid attorney and said nothing.

The Transformers star walked 
several blocks to a hotel surrounded by media but declined to comment.

He was carrying his shoelaces, which are 
typically removed in police cells, and a piece of paper from the court. LaBeouf is due back in court on July 24.

The 28-year-old was charged with 
disorderly conduct after he was escorted out of a Broadway show in 
handcuffs for allegedly smoking, acting belligerent and slapping people 
on the behind during the performance.

LaBeouf had spent Thursday afternoon drinking margaritas at Iguana Bar in Midtown and watching Belgium play South Korea in the World Cup.

A bartender told TMZ that he showed up at 1pm and had two or three drinks but no food. He was polite and tipped well, the server said. He also told the bar staff that he wasn't a big soccer fan but wanted to be patriotic because he had Belgian family.

The 
troubled actor was led away in tears from the Studio 54 theater on West 
54th Street around 9.30pm after causing a disturbance during
 the first act of Cabaret.

LaBeouf screamed at the arresting officer: 'F*** you... this is f****** b******t... Do you know my life?'

He then added: 'Do you know who the f*** I am?', according to The Smoking Gun.

A
 passerby snapped a blurry photograph of LaBeouf outside the venue as he
 was being taken into custody. He had tried to walk away from officers 
but fell on his face.

He was taken to the Midtown North precinct where The New York Post
 reported that he told officers 'I'll f*** you up' and called one a 
'f**'.

The Transformers star was muzzled with a face mask because he 
wouldn't stop spitting, officers said. 

He allegedly told one cop: 'I have millions and millions of dollars and attorneys... I’m going to ruin your career.'

Officers 
told the Post that LaBeouf was 'incoherent and agitated'. One said that 
the actor smelled bad and told lies about having served in the military.

He then began rapping a made-up song, repeating 'I want to go out. I want to go out' an NYPD source told the Post.

LaBeouf was charged with criminal trespass, harassment and disorderly conduct. He was processed and released from a holding cell on Friday morning, an NYPD spokesman told MailOnline today.

The
 28-year-old actor had been attending the Thursday night performance of 
the Tony Award-nominated musical, which stars Michelle Williams and Alan
 Cumming.

Sadly, Shia LaBeouf's arrest for 
disorderly conduct at a Broadway theater on Thursday is just the latest 
incident in a string of erratic episodes for the former child star.

Bizarre behavior: LaBeouf arrived at the Nymphomaniac premiere in February wearing a brown paper bag

Earlier this year, the Transformers star
 made headlines when he walked the red carpet at the Berlin Film 
Festival with a brown paper bag over his head.

Around the same time he declared he was 'retiring from public life because of attacks against his artistic integrity'.

In
 January, LaBeouf got into a scuffle with a fellow drinker at the 
Hobgoblin pub in New Cross, South London, headbutting him apparently 
over remarks made about the mother of his girlfriend Mia Goth.

And last year, the actor famously quit the 
production of Broadway's ORPHANS then shared several confrontational emails 
between himself and fellow actors Alex Baldwin and Tom Sturridge, 
explaining why he pulled out of the show. 

In 2007, he was arrested for refusing to leave a Walgreens in Chicago but the criminal charges were later dropped.

In
 February 2005, LaBeouf was arrested in Los Angeles and charged with 
assault with a deadly weapon for driving into his neighbor's car after 
losing his temper about having to wait to get into his garage. He then 
later turned up at his neighbor's door, allegedly waving a kitchen 
knife.

LaBeouf refused to comment to the media when he left court on Friday morning in Manhattan, wearing the same clothes as the night before, and made his way to a hotel. The actor looked exhausted with a rip in his T-shirt and carrying his shoelaces and piece of paper from court (right)

Two theatergoers told CBS they saw the actor on Thursday with a ripped shirt close to the theater around 6.30pm. The witnesses said he appeared to be chasing a homeless man for a bag of McDonald's food.

However TMZ reported that the actor was actually trying to get a hold of a baseball cap that the man was carrying which he believed to belong to him.

According to Broadway World, audience members on the scene described the actor as having been extremely disruptive throughout the entire first act of the show. He was kicked out at the intermission, the show confirmed.

One report said that LaBeouf was yelling and being loud during the show and another claimed he was smoking inside.

Sources 
told The Post that the actor was annoying other theater-goers 
and reportedly went backstage to slap the behinds of some actors he knew.

He also slapped the behind of Alan Cumming as he walked through the audience as part of the show - but the seasoned actor didn't flinch. 

LaBeouf also made lewd comments and grunting, before crashing off his chair during Michelle Williams' solo number.

However, a theater-goer who was sitting at the next table to LaBeouf during Cabaret came to his defense.

She told Gawker: 'He was probably a bit too intoxicated to be there, but he seemed like a congenial drunk who was really excited to be at the show.'

She said that he shared a table with two ladies who he asked to 'watch my shit' when he went to the bar. He brought them back drinks in souvenir mugs. He asked them where they were from and when they replied New York, he exclaimed: 'You're f****** kidding me!'

Once the show started, with every new song, the actor threw his arms in the air and bobbed along to the music.

'He was arrested at a Broadway show and escorted out of the theater,' an NYPD spokeman told MailOnline, adding 'charges are pending'.

The spokesman said: 'He was causing a disturbance inside the theater. He was escorted out of the theater where officers met him and he was taken into custody.'

A spokesman for LaBeouf had no comment for the New York Daily News.

Broadway 
World reported that cast member Danny Burstein, who plays Herr Schultz in the musical, wrote of the 
incident on Facebook: 'Ladies and gentlemen, this is your places call 
for Act II.  

'Also, to let you know, Shia LaBeouf has just been escorted 
from the building in handcuffs. Yep, that just happened.'

On
 Twitter, Tony nominated composer Benj Pasek wrote: 'Just saw Shia 
LaBeouf in handcuffs in tears surrounded by 6 police offers outside of 
Cabaret the musical.'
