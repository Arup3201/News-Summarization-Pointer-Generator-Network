At first glance this tray of chicken and vegetables looks like the makings of a tasty meal.

But a closer inspection suggests the results would be a little dry.

What appears to be chicken, carrots and parsnips is in fact a three dimensional sculpture made entirely from cardboard.

Painstaking: The artist prints out images of food then cuts them to shape and stacks them to create three dimensional sculptures

The clever sculptures cost a little more than a pre-packaged supermarket meal too - with some pieces fetching up to £400.

Spanish artist Stefanie Herr prints out images of food such as chicken, steak, sardines or onions, and applies the pictures to hundreds of pieces of card.

She then cuts the pieces to shape and stacks them to create a three dimensional version of a tray of food.

Quirky: The artist's unusual creations sell for between £200 and £450

Meticulous: The 38-year-old has created of scores of pieces of 'topographic art'

Pre-packaged: The artist's creations are fashioned to look like trays of meat found on supermarket shelves

The 38-year-old spends several weeks meticulously cutting out images and precisely stacking the layers of cardboard to create each of her trays, which are the same size as those found on supermarket shelves.

Her quirky creations sell for between £250 and £400.

Ms Herr, who is from Barcelona, said: 'I quit my job as an architectural designer and made myself a topographic fine artist in 2007.

'I liked the look of traditional contour line modelling, and I thought it could have artistic potential.

'Each of my artworks can take several weeks of solitary, persistent and meticulous manual labour,' she said.

Ready for the oven: After the framework of the piece is built up using layers of cardboard, the artist applies the picture of the food, which acts as the 'skin' of the piece

'Once
I have developed the framework of a project, my first task is to 
provide the foundation of the piece, which is usually built up of layers
of cardboard,' Ms Herr explained.

'Then the picture, which acts as the "skin" of the final piece, is cut according to the topographic pattern.

'The resulting wavy stripes are finally glued onto the cardboard object one by one.'

The artist has created around 60 pieces of her topographic art, which she said inspires a wide variety of reactions.

'Responses vary greatly depending on individual taste,' she said.

'As always with art, some people are deeply impressed, while others just shake their heads in bewilderment.'
