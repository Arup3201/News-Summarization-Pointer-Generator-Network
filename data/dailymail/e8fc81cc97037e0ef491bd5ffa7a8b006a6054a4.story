Aston Villa are still waiting to discover if they have succeeded in a last-ditch attempt to take Tom Cleverley on loan from Manchester United.

It appeared as though Villa would sign Cleverley in a permanent £7.5million deal on deadline day when United accepted their offer and the England midfielder headed to the Midlands for a medical.

However, Everton attempted to hijack the transfer when chairman Bill Kenwright opened talks with United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward but saw his bid of £5.5m flatly refused.

Getting to grips: Cleverley was in danger of finding himself frozen out at United if he did not secure a move

Cleverley, who was forced to train with the reserves at Carrington last week, was in danger of being left in limbo before Villa boss Paul Lambert revived the deal just before Monday’s 11pm deadline.

Villa were granted an extension by the Premier League until 1am to complete a loan move but the paperwork was not submitted until 1.15am.

They are now waiting to find out if it will be ratified so the 25-year-old can move to Villa Park. 

Lambert has been looking to beef up his midfield despite adding Carlos Sanchez, Joe Cole and Kieran Richardson over the summer.

He also sold Karim El Ahmadi back to Feyenoord and loaned Aleksandar Tonev to Celtic.

Cleverley looks to have little future at Old Trafford with boss Louis van Gaal making him available for transfer and Hull were also interested before moving for Newcastle's Hatem Ben Arfa.

The England midfielder has made 79 appearances for United, the last coming in their 1-1 draw at Sunderland two weeks ago.

That was then: Cleverley was a regular under previous boss David Moyes but not under Louis van Gaal

International: Cleverley will hope this potential move will help him secure his place in the England side
