A celebrated Kurdish female fighter who bravely commanded an all-female resistance force against ISIS in the besieged city of Kobane is believed to have been killed by the militant group.

Hebun Sinya, also known as Hebun Dêrik, was a prominent figure within the YPJ - the woman-only offshoot of the Kurdish YPG group that has proved so effective in defending Kobane since the city was first attacked by Islamic State terrorists last September.

Last month the Kurdish troops were able to push the final ISIS militants out of Kobane, but official YPG/YPJ sources have now said that Sinya was among four  fighters tragically killed in the process.

Sinya appeared in numerous motivational videos and photographs used by the YPG/YPJ to inspire their fighters to continue defending Kobane from the ISIS terrorists attempting to seize control.

At numerous points in the four month siege it appeared the city was close to falling, with Kurdish troops trapped in the centre and surrounded on all sides by the militants, who raped and massacred their way through the suburbs towards the end of last year.

The arrival of Kurdish peshmerga support squadrons from neighbouring Iraq boosted the fightback, however, and by early January the YPG/YPJ had pinned ISIS back into small pockets of the city.

The fearlessness of the Kurdish fighters in the face of ISIS' uncompromising brutality was such that some militants are said to have defied their commanders' orders to continue the fight in Kobane as it had been little more than  death trap for them.

Hero: Hebun Sinya is believed to have been killed in the final push to rid Kobane of ISIS militants

However it was in the final push to completely clear Kobane of terrorists that Sinya, a young male fighter named Ywan Zaghrws, and two as yet unidentified others are understood to have been killed.

YPJ is short for Yekîneyên Parastina Jinê, which means Women's Protection Units in Kurdish. The group was established in 2012 as a branch of the YPG (People's Protection Unit) and is believed to have anything between 7,000 and 10,000 members - mostly in Syria and Iraq.

The majority of these female fighters have spent the past six months battling ISIS and have had great success in pinning the terror group back and liberating towns and cities under the militants' control.

The fact the YPJ is an all-female group has had another unexpected benefit as ISIS militants are said to believe that if they are killed by a woman, they will not be rewarded with 72 virgins in the afterlife.

'These [ISIS] soldiers apparently believed that if they were killed in battle, they went to paradise as long as they were killed by a man,' Ed Royce, who chairs the U.S. House International Relations Committee, told The New York Post last September.

'And these female soldiers were communicating their satisfaction with the fact that they had taken the fight to ISIL and had stopped the advance, turned back the advance - slayed a number of these fighters, who would then run away,' he added. 

As a result ISIS militants have been reluctant to enter battles with the YPJ, reportedly leading to descent within the ranks of the terrorists and hastening their retreat from battles in places like Kobane.

Kurds are celebrating after flushing Islamic State militants out of the town of Kobane, but victory is not yet certain in their campaign to cement hard-won autonomy in northern Syria.

Hundreds of U.S.-led coalition air strikes have devastated the town, which is adrift in an Islamic State-controlled sea. Objections to autonomy from neighbouring Turkey and the United States could also make it hard for them to sustain their gains.

The retaking by  last week of the predominantly Kurdish town after a four-month siege by Islamic State was a major defeat for the Sunni fundamentalist group that controls a 20,000-square mile arc of Syria and Iraq.

For the Kurds, it is a bittersweet victory, as some 200,000 people, almost the entire population of Koran province, are still sheltering in Turkey.

But many were exuberant. Dozens of men waiting at the Turkish crossing to return to Koran province late last week shouted and danced for joy, unframed by the wrecked city of Kobane looming behind them.

Most of Kobane is destroyed, with unexplored shells and twisted hunks of cars strewn along the streets.

The battle for Kobane weakened Islamic State, its best fighters perishing and much of its heavy weaponry depleted, Anwar Muslim, the top official in the town told Reuters at Freedom Square, where a statue of an eagle is surrounded by flattened tower blocks and cratered streets.

'They will attack again ... The coalition has supported us with weapons and air strikes. We are hopeful they will continue so we can eradicate ISIS,' Muslim said, adding that Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga and a few Free Syrian Army brigades remain in Kobane.

The FSA cooperation marks a turnaround after earlier clashes between them and the Kurds. Last month, Syrian government forces also battled Kurds, breaking a tacit agreement between the two sides to focus on other enemies in the war.

The Kurds, who espouse socialism and promote gender equality, first captured Koran province in 2012 after Assad's forces withdrew, dubbing it the Rojas, or western, Revolution. Two other non-contiguous Kurdish-dominated regions of Syria, Arvin and Jaeger, are also under their control. Kurds say it is home to about 4 million people.

The Syrian civil war, which began as a popular uprising against President Bashar al-Assad in March 2011, has killed 200,000 people and turned 3 million more into refugees.
