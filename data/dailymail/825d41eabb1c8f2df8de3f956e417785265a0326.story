A team of historians believe they have unearthed evidence of a 4,000-year-old Stone Age camp - thanks to a dog walker.

Roger Hall was walking his pet at Cannock Wood in Staffordshire, when he discovered a handful of strange-shaped rocks.

Experts later identified the rocks as flint 'flakes', which are the off-cuts from tools crafted by Stone Age Man 4,000 years ago.

Discovery: The Stone Age flints were found in Cannock Wood, which is also the location of the Iron Age hill fort Castle Ring, pictured, dating from around 2,500 year ago

If the discovery is confirmed, it could mark the spot of the only Neolithic camp known in the Midlands.

Roger Knowles, a member of the Council for British Archaeology, is convinced the camp could identify a link from the time when mankind changed from nomadic hunter-gatherer to village dweller.

Mr Knowles is now calling for a full excavation of the site after contacting the Staffordshire County Council archaeologist.

Excited: Archaeologist Roger Knowles said the discovery could be one of the most important for decades and now wants the site to be fully excavated

He said: 'This could be the most significant historical find for decades. There have been previous individual finds from the Stone Age - tools, weapons and burial sites - but never a settlement. It's very exciting.

'I really haven't a clue what they would find if they began a full excavation.

'I've studied the area time and again. There's a sandstone cliff and I wonder if the people of that time built their settlement against it for shelter.

'From there they would have had an amazing view, all the way to the Derbyshire Hills.'

He added: 'It would not have been a big community, a couple of families at most living in thatched dwellings surrounded by a wooden blockade.

The slivers of stone handed by Mr Hall to Mr Knowles provide an insight into the Neolithic period, known as the New Stone Age - a part of our history of which little is known.

The Cannock Wood tribe had access to flint - in an area where the stone is not native.

Mr Knowles explained: 'They either discovered flat pebbles of it in the River Trent, or it was imported from down south.'

The discovery is just the latest archaeological treasure unearthed in Cannock Wood, where pagans still flock to celebrate the summer solstice at Castle Ring, an Iron Age fort, dating from around 2,500 years ago, thought to possess mystical powers.

In 1907, two London archaeologists discovered a New Stone Age 'flint' factory on nearby farming land. The haul included 600 flint blades and 40 complete 'implements'.

Mr Knowles is convinced there are more treasures to be found in the Cannock Wood area.

He added: 'The area really is a magical spot and each discovery shows New Stone Age man was a lot cleverer than we first thought.'
