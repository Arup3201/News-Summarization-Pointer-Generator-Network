With his mouth open wide and head tipped back, this adorable stoat could be belting out a tune for onlookers.

The short-tailed weasel was caught on camera at the British Wildlife Centre in Lingfield, Surrey.

He can be seen opening his jaw as if in mid-song, before stepping down from centre stage and posing on a log.

The small but outgoing animal was captured by Welsh carpenter and joiner Geoffrey Baker, 58.

'The
 little stoat was entertaining the crowds and showing off his vocal 
cords for us,' said Mr Baker, from Afan Valley, South Wales.

'He
 was enjoying the interaction with the public and seemed to love the 
attention that he was getting as people gathered round to see him 
perform.

'I only took a few snapshots of him, but
 luckily captured this one, where he appears to be entertaining the 
crowds with opera.

'I just love the novelty value of this picture - itÂ  looks as though he's in the middle of belting out a song.'

Stoats - a species of Mustelidae - can be found throughout North America, Europe, Asia, Greenland and the Canadian and Siberian Arctic islands.

They are usually silent animals, but can produce a range of sounds, including whines, squeals, hisses, sharp barks, screeches and chirping noises.

Describing his encounter with the animal, Mr Baker said: 'It was pretty cold on this particular day, around minus five degrees, so I was surprised to see the stoat out and about in its enclosure.'

He added that the weasel didn't appear put off by the weather - instead, reacting warmly to onlookers at the wildlife centre.

The centre, which opened in 1997, is now home to more than 40 species of animal, including the American Milk, Polecat, Wildcat and Yellow-Necked Mousse.

It aims to teach people about Britain's native wildlife in the hope that they will want to protect it for future generations to enjoy.
