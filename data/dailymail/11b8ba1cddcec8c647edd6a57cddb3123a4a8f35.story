Cruel: Kerry Evans, 25, is shown posing with one of his pit bulls, which has had its ears ripped off

An illegal dog fighter who bred pit bull terriers for vicious bloodsports walked free from court - because he’s soon to become a father.

Kerry Evans, 25, trained six pit bulls to fight in illegal underground leagues where people pay to watch dogs tear other apart, and bet on the outcomes.

RSPCA officers found Evans's dogs covered in brutal scars, while many were missing ears because of the banned sport, which police have described as 'disgusting'.

A court today heard the banned breed had been involved in the recent deaths of children in the UK.

But even though he was convicted on 16 charges linked to raising the dogs and participating in illegal fights, Evans was only given a suspended prison sentence.

Prosecutor Aled Watkins said: 'Evans was involved in organised dog fighting and kept six pit bull terriers to be used in this barbaric crime.

'The aggravating features in this case are the numbers of fighting dogs he kept.

'Quite frighteningly one dog had been bred from and her puppies were offered for sale over the internet.

'The day after Evans’ trial finished we heard the sad news involving the death of a child cause by a banned pit bull. It is a frightening feature of this case.'

Evans was arrested after the RSPCA discovered five of the banned fighting dogs in a kennel near his home.

RSPCA inspector Simon Evans left a note on the kennel asking for the owner to come forward, and was later phoned by an angry Evans.

Another illegal pit bull, named Mason, was later discovered in his home in Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales.

Evans turned up with a large bag ready to be jailed at Newport Magistrates Court.

'Unhealthy interest': The judge attacked Evans's interest in the illegal sport, but spared him from jail despite a his 16 convictions. The dog pictured above is not a banned breed

Scarred: RSPCA officers reported that Evans's dogs were covered in scars and many had lost their ears in brutal scraps

But Clive Rees, defending, pleaded for his liberty because he is due to become a father on Thursday.

He said: 'He is anxious to stay out of jail to be there for the birth of his first and only child.

'His partner is due to give birth on Thursday and they hope to move into a flat together afterwards.'

Evans was found guilty by Merthyr Tydfil magistrates last month on six charges of keeping or training pit bull terrier-type dogs, and six of having possession or custody of pit bull terrier-type dogs.

He was also convicted of four charges of having equipment for use in connection with an animal fight.

Evans was given a six-month suspended jail sentence for a year and banned from keeping, dealing or transporting dogs for eight years.

Evans was also fined £1,000 and ordered to carry out 200 hours unpaid work.

All six dogs were ordered to be killed by the RSPCA along with dog fighting equipment and graphic books showing dogs tearing each other apart.

Bloodsport: The dogs are trained to be fighting machines and steroids are sometimes used in the training process. The above dog was one of the six found by the RSCPA

Banned: As well as being ordered to pay a fine, Evans has been banned from keeping, dealing or transporting dogs for eight years

Police raided Evans’ home to seize first aid kits containing syringes and antibiotics - to secretly treat the dogs after fights.

Officers also uncovered 'break sticks' used to prise open dogs' jaws.

The court heard Evans boasted in online videos and Facebook messages about the power of his dogs’ jaws.

District Judge John Charles told him: 'You have an extremely unhealthy interest in pit bull fighting.

'There is evidence of injury to the dogs and there is a potential of more serious harm as you bred from one of the dogs and offered the puppies for sale.

'You are about to become a father for the first time - let there be no doubt about the situation.'Dog fighting was made illegal in the UK in 1835 but the court heard there had been a resurgence in the 1980s with the influx of pit bull terriers.

RSPCA chief inspector Michael Butcher told the court how the shadowy world of organised dog fighting was thriving in underground leagues across the country.

Finds: Police investigators found books showing graphic images of dogs tearing each other apart as well as first aid supplies for treating the dogs in fights. The dog in the picture above is not a banned breed

Chief Inspector Butcher said: 'It’s quite a small fraternity with almost exclusively pit bull-type dogs used, being bred for the purpose.

'They will meet any dog in a pit face-to-face and go through the pain barrier.

'The dogs will be trained - it is very organised.'

He said dog fighting was like boxing and governed by similar rules - with a corner man and first aid kits available during the fights in a pit measuring 12 square feet and 2ft 6ins deep.

Chief Inspector Butcher said dogs could become champions or grand champions depending on how many fights they won.

He told the court: 'The dog used would be the one you knew would do the business.

'All the injuries tend to be around the head, face, chest and front legs. Dog fighting is about courage not the physical side of things.

'The dog would have to be brought down from kennel weight by exercise, food and diet, and sometimes steroids and supplements would be used to have the dog at an optimum fighting weight.

'We’re receiving more reports about illegal dogs. It’s an obsession with these people - it’s barbaric.

'Two dogs fighting - sometimes to the death - is a disgusting way for people trying to enjoy themselves and earn money through betting illegally.'
