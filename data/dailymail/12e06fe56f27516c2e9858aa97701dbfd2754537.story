Police in South Los Angeles have said a seven-year-old boy riding a bike was hit and killed by an ice cream truck on Wednesday night and the driver was then attacked by an angry mob.

LAPD spokeswoman Officer Nuria Venegas says the truck hit the child shortly after 7 p.m. Wednesday, and he later died at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center.

Police in LA, which has been dealing with scorching temperatures recently, say the child had been riding alongside the truck, and the collision was an accident.

Shocking: The little boy died riding alongside the ice cream truck in South Los Angeles on Wednesday night

'He was riding an electronic bike right next to the ice cream truck, apparently he may have slipped, got caught up underneath the truck, the rear wheels rolled over him,' Sgt. Timothy Colson told NBC Los Angeles.

The crowd that attacked the driver threw bricks at him and one man is said by police to have threatened him witha knife.

The driver managed to get to safety, suffering bruises and was taken to hospital as a precaution.

The boy, known only as William, was heading home with his older brother when the accident happened.

No charges: The police have said the boy's death was an accident and the driver has not been arrested

The boy's uncle, Michael Harris was distraught.

'I don’t know what I’m going to tell my brother. His son is dead,' said Harris to NBC Los Angeles.

'They say it was an accident but I don’t believe that. I don’t believe that one bit, none at all.'

Harris also admitted the boy's mother may have attacked the ice cream truck driver.

'She has every right to,' said Harris.

Police are calling the incident a tragic accident and the driver was not put under arrest.

“I walked outside. He was lying on the ground bleeding, so I just tried to comfort the family ’cause they was screaming,” said Linda Black, a witness to CBS Los Angeles. “It’s really sad because I have a kid that is younger than he is.”
