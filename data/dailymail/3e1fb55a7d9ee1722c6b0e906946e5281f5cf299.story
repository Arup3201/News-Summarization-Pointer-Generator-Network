Police are hunting for a serial fancy dress robber who has targeted bookmakers all over the country in at least 11 different disguises.

Martin Joseph Reilly, 53, dons wigs, hats, false moustaches and special outfits before robbing the shops at gunpoint or with a knife.

He has dressed as Elvis Presley, a tramp and a labourer before stealing from the bookies.

Sussex Police said today he is believed to have targeted stores in their county, as well as in Hampshire, Surrey, Northamptonshire, Bedfordshire, Essex and most recently London, travelling between them on trains.

Detective Inspector Ian Still, from Brighton CID, said: 'We hope that by publicising Martin's name and photograph for the first time it may prompt members of the public who know him or recognise him to come forward.

'What is distinctive about him is that he uses fancy dress disguises - wigs, hats, false beards, moustaches and sideburns - to alter his appearance and to hide scarring on his cheeks, particularly horseshoe-like scarring on his left-hand cheek.

'We are linking the 11 robberies and attempted robberies from each of the counties due to the use of disguises and his modus operandi - almost always striking just as the shops open up and arming himself with a knife or gun to threaten staff.

'It is not known if the gun is imitation or real.

'We believe Reilly is using the rail network or other public transport to reach stores just as they are opening up.

'Fortunately to date, Reilly has not harmed staff or members of the public during any of the robberies but we would still advise people to not approach him but to contact police immediately should they see him.'

The Association of British Bookmakers has offered a reward of up to £10,000 for information that will lead to Reilly's arrest and conviction.

Neil Harris, divisional security and safety manager for Ladbrokes Betting and Gaming, said: 'We have been working closely with Sussex Police and other police forces in an attempt to find Martin Reilly.

'We are hoping that by providing Sussex Police with various CCTV images from our stores and putting up a reward that someone will recognise Reilly before he strikes again.

'This has been a very frightening experience for our staff but fortunately no-one has been injured.'

Reilly is described as white, 6ft 1in and of medium build, with blue eyes, a shaven bald head and scars on each cheek.

He has at various times lived in both Corby and Kettering in Northamptonshire and has connections to London, having previously lived in the Croydon area and is known to frequent Kilburn.

He is also known to use different names such as Martin McAuley, Martin Anderson and Martin O'Reilly.

Anyone with information concerning Reilly should contact Sussex Police on 0845 60 70 999, quoting Operation Shelley, or the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
