She interviewed Elizabeth Taylor just a month before the
screen icon passed away.

And now Kim Kardashian is the proud owner of several
pieces of her idol’s jewellery.

The reality star, 31, shelled out $65,000 to secure three
diamond and jade bracelets that Miss Taylor owned.

Splurge: Kim Kardashian has shelled out $65,000 on three bracelets owned by Elizabeth Taylor

Kim was said to have been involved in a bidding war with
several other jewellery fanatics, according to TMZ.

Miss Kardashian has confessed to viewers on her reality show
just how much she adores the late actress and she will no doubt be ecstatic to
own the three Lorranise Schwatz bangle bracelets which she paid $64,900 for.

In February Kim interview Liz for Harpers Bazzar magazine where
she described herself as an ‘Elizabeth Taylor nerd’.

In the interview the reality star posed several questions to
the Cleopatra star one being: ‘ You are my idol. But I'm six husbands and some
big jewels behind. What should I do?’

Liz, who was 78 at the time replied: ‘I never planned to
acquire a lot of jewels or a lot of husbands. For me, life happened, just as it
does for anyone else. I have been supremely lucky in my life in that I have
known great love, and of course I am the temporary custodian of some incredible
and beautiful things,’ before adding: ‘But I have never felt more alive than
when I watched my children delight in something, never more alive than when I
have watched a great artist perform, and never richer than when I have scored a
big check to fight AIDS. Follow your passion, follow your heart, and the things
you need will come.’

Expensive tastes: Kim has often said that Elizabeth Taylor is her idol and she is a huge fan of the late actress' style

The actress's astonishing 
jewellery collection fetched a record-breaking $115million (£75million) 
at auction in New York - including more than $11.8million for a pearl necklace and 
$8.8million for a diamond ring, both given to her by Richard Burton.

The necklace was made to display a historic pearl known as 'La Peregrina', which Burton bought for Taylor in 1969 and which cost him $37,000 
(£23,000).

Last night the necklace fetched a world record price of
 $11,842,500  (£7.6million).

It had been estimated to sell for 
$2million to $3million  at the auction at Christie's of 
jewels, clothes and other memorabilia amassed by the late actress.

The pear-shaped La Peregrina is widely considered to be one 
of the most important pearls in the world. It dates 
from the 16th century, was painted by Velasquez and belonged to King Phillip II of Spain 
and to Queen Mary I.

Burton worked with Cartier to have it hung on the diamond and ruby 
necklace.

The 33.19-carat diamond ring, also 
given to Taylor by Burton, whom she married twice, was bought by a 
private buyer from Asia for $8,818,500 (£5.6million).

Thomas
 W Burstein of Christie's said the only time the ring left 
Taylor's hand was when she offered it to friends to try on.

Taylor, a screen goddess who was a 
child star in National Velvet and went on to classics such as Cleopatra 
and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, died in Los Angeles in March at the
 age of 79.

One of the world's most beautiful 
women, she was married eight times and was showered with jewels by 
admirers. Her famous collection includes pieces from Cartier, Van Cleef 
& Arpels and Chopard.

Her possessions going under the hammer span five decades and tell the story of her eventful life, from the couture frocks worn 
during her two weddings to Burton, to the dazzling ruby and diamond 
Cartier jewellery set which was a gift from her third husband, film producer Mike
 Todd.

Making an entrance: The Collection of Elizabeth Taylor - an exhibition 
of her clothes and jewellery - was taken on a worldwide three month tour before the auction

Other tokens from admirers include 
jewellery and an autographed poster from Taylor's cherished friend, 
Michael Jackson. The 1987 print is signed: 'To my true love Elizabeth. I
 love you forever.'

A diamond bracelet given to the actress by Jackson, 
with an estimated sale price of $30,000 to $50,000, went for $194,500 
(£125,500). A diamond and sapphire ring which was a gift from the singer fetched $600,000 (£388,000).

The collection has been on exhibition in the UK, Moscow, Los Angeles, Dubai, Geneva, Paris and Hong 
Kong  as part of a three-month global tour ahead of the auction.

The exhibition 
is also a journey through Taylor's evolving fashion sense, from her 
glamorous red carpet gowns to beaded Versace jackets, a sea of gold Hermes bags, 
sequin Chanel clutches and satin Louboutins.

Meredith Etherington-Smith, curator 
of Taylor's fashion collection, called the display a glimpse into 
Taylor's 'tempestuous, fabulous, technicolor personality that epitomizes
 gutsy glamour'.

Other sales of Taylor's art, clothing
 and memorabilia will be held later in the week.

Fashion collectors will have the opportunity to purchase unique designs such as a Versace 
beaded evening jacket adorned with portraits of the actress in some of 
her famous movie roles, estimated to sell for up to $20,000, and the sunflower yellow dress by 
Hollywood designer Irene Sharaff that Taylor wore to her 1964 wedding to
 Burton, boasting a pre-sale estimate of $40,000 to $60,000.

A
 total of 269 pieces from her jewellery collection are up for auction while 400 fashion items spanning over 50 years of Taylor's life will also be sold.

Some 950 of the star’s more affordable personal belongings are the subject of bidding online, with many items still below $1000. They include an art deco bracelet and a white and gold diamond.

£63-£123: Art deco bracelet and earrings

£250-£370: Navajo silver necklace

£1,240: Gold and pearl bird brooch

£185-£310: Lanvin patent leather bag

£125-£185: Cowboy boots with E.T initials

£500-£973: Black Nolan Miller gown

Other items include a Bulgari cuff, 
custom made black cowboy boots, a black Lanvin shoulder bag and a 
multi-coloured Oscar de la Renta gown.

They will be placed into one of four 
categories – fine jewellery, fashion and accessories, costume jewellery 
and decorative arts and memorabilia – and will be featured on the 
website for Christie’s from Friday.

Bidding will take place over a two-week period.

The
 auction at christies.com will work in a similar way to eBay – whoever 
has the highest bid at the end of the bidding time will win the item.

Another piece in the online sale is a
 green linen embroidered kaftan that Taylor wore to publisher 
Malcolm Forbes’s 70th birthday party in Morocco.

The bash cost an 
estimated £1.5million with Forbes chartering a Boeing 747, a DC-8 and a 
Concorde to fly in 800 of the world’s rich and famous from New York and 
London.

Miss Taylor was his co-host.

Other
 pieces for sale include 22 handbags by Dior and Valentino, 500 pieces 
of fine and costume jewellery and 400 more designer fashion items.

Part of the proceeds will go to The 
Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation, which she established in 1991 to help 
people living with AIDS.

Taylor's collection of impressionist and modern art is scheduled to go on sale at Christie's in London in February.

With seven husbands, 50 films and a £360million fortune to her name, Elizabeth Taylor never did anything by halves.

So it seems appropriate that the star’s extensive jewellery collection has sold for more than £80million – making it the most expensive private hoard in history.

Though bidders were still battling to snap up the sought-after items last night, the auction had already smashed the £45.8million record set in 1987 at a sale of the Duchess of Windsor’s gems in Geneva.

Over two evenings of frantic bidding at Christie’s in New York, some items sold for as much as 150 times their reserve price.

The most expensive was a 50-carat pearl, diamond and ruby necklace called La Peregrina.

Listed for between £1.2million and £1.9million, it went for £7.5million on Tuesday night, breaking two world records – the highest sum for an historic pearl and for a pearl jewel.

Other items shot up by more than £1million in 30 seconds as fierce bidding wars erupted over the most coveted lots. It was a fitting tribute to the last of the Hollywood greats, who died in March aged 79.
