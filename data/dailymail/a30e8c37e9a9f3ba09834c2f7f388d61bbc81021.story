For Luis Figo, Monday’s Ballon d’Or announcement is a straight fight between Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi – but there’s only one winner.

The former Portugal international, who played for both Real Madrid and Barcelona, says his fellow countryman Ronaldo ‘has to’ retain his crown.

And, rather amusingly, Figo claims the pair are the ‘truffles and caviar’ of world football.

Cristiano Ronaldo should win the Ballon d'Or for a second year running, according to Luis Figo

Ronaldo, whose goals last season fired Real to a first Champions League title since 2002, is the favourite to beat both Messi and World Cup winner Manuel Neuer.

‘It's hard to choose between truffles and caviar, but for me it has to be Cristiano. He’s had a fantastic year all the way through for Real,’ Figo said.

Neuer – the sweeper goalkeeper to have captured the imagination long before the summer tournament in Brazil – would become the first stopper to claim the prize since Lev Yashin 52 years ago.

And while Figo is insistent Ronaldo will take the gong, he does understand the clamour for Neuer.

‘I know Germany won the World Cup and I understand there are those who think Neuer, who is such a great keeper and was a big part of their success, should win it,’ he added.

Messi will be there without the Barcelona president Josep Bartomeu, who is to boycott the ceremony in protest at the transfer ban imposed upon the club by FIFA.

The Catalans are not allowed to make any signings in the next two transfer windows because of a breach of rules relating to the signing of international players under the age of 18.

'FIFA has not told us who made the original charge and during the period of the sanction we will not maintain any institutional relations with them,' Bartomeu said.

'I have sent a stern letter to Sepp Blatter and I will not be attending the FIFA Ballon d'Or gala set for January 12.'
