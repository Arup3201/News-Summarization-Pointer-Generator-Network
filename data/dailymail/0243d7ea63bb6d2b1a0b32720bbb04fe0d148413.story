Good luck: The Shamballa bracelet (pictured) is used by Buddhists and Hindus for meditation and as a sign of good luck in the Western world

A good luck bracelet worn by  Formula 1 legend Michael Schumacher throughout his racing career has been found in the snow where he suffered his catastrophic ski accident three weeks ago.

The Shamballa wooden bead bracelet was found at the accident site by mountain rescue workers and has now been placed by the racing driver’s hospital bed.

Schumacher, 45, has remained in an artificial coma at the University Hospital in Grenoble, France, since his accident at the ski resort of Meribel on December 29.

He has since undergone two operations in an attempt to reduce the swelling on his brain.

Bracelets such as his, worn by Buddhists and Hindus, were historically used to aid meditation, and have become a symbol of good luck in the West.

The find comes as fears grow in Schumacher’s homeland that he might never be woken from the coma.

A number of German publications quoted neurological experts voicing concerns the injuries he suffered were far worse than the media were led to believe.

But a statement from his manager said his family had the utmost faith in the medical team treating him, and anything about his condition that did not emanate from those doctors was pure speculation.

‘Michael’s family is very satisfied with  the work of the team of doctors treating him and trusts them absolutely,’ said manager Sabine Kehm.

‘Michael’s condition is stable.’

Schumacher’s wife Corinne, 44, visits him every day and there are no plans yet to awaken him.

But the prolonged coma is fuelling concerns that his injuries were so severe that he has not recovered anywhere near enough to be brought out of it.

The coma means that oxygen to his brain is reduced, so that it works less and is better placed to recover from the injuries sustained during a low-speed ski accident.

Patients put in such comas are usually brought out of them after a week or two.

Neurosurgeon Andreas Zieger, of the University Clinic for neurosurgery in Oldenburg, told Germany’s Focus magazine: ‘There may have been complications. We should not speculate here.

'Ultimately we are talking about life and death. A coma can in theory be maintained for a lifetime. It won’t hurt the human brain.’
