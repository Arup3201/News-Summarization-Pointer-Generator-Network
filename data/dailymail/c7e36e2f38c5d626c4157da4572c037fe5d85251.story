A 66-year-old man was dramatically rescued after his yacht was hit by a whale and started sinking off the coast of Mexico.

Max Young of Sacramento, California, was sailing alone 40 miles west of La Playa, Mexico, when his 50-foot sailboat Reflections was struck by the giant mammal.

The impact from the collision knocked out the vessel's propeller and rudder and it started flooding with seawater.

Young, described by the US Coast Guard as a 'seasoned sailor,' activated an emergency signal that was picked up by officials in Alameda, California, and a C-130 Hercules plane was sent to find him.

By the time the coast guard made radio contact with the stranded mariner three hours later it was pitch black, his boat was close to being totally flooded and he feared the worst.

Lieutenant Amy Kefarl, of the US Coast Guard, told KXTV in Sacramento: 'He thought he was done.

'He was actually pretty frantic.

'He asked me to make sure [we] told his wife that he loved her and that he had something for his grandkids to give them. We reassured him [and] told him that help was on the way.'

Video footage shot from the nose of the coast guard's aircraft showed rough waves tossing Mr Young's boat around.

Luckily for Mr Young, a container ship was only about 60 miles away and altered course to rescue him.

When it arrived at about 4am on Wednesday, Mr Young was able to scramble off his boat by a rope ladder thrown down by the crew and escaped unharmed.

'This case is one of those success stories,' Petty Officer 2nd Class Pamela Boehland, of the US Coast Guard, said.

'A man went out prepared, the worst happened to him and he was able to respond.'

Mr Young had safely sailed all around the globe in the yacht, including pirate-infested waters off Yemen, and was on the last two days of his journey back to California.

His brother, Joe Ferro, had been due to join him on the final leg of his world trip.

Mr Ferro told CBS Sacramento: 'I just can't believe it because he is very careful and that boat has got every warning device there is for anything coming at him except a whale.'

He said his brother would have remained calm as the boat began sinking.

'Knowing Max, he doesn't panic - he figures out "OK, what do I have to do next?" and he does it.'

But Mr Young's wife Debra said she was horrified at just how close her husband had come to drowning.

'He said there was two feet before she [the boat] was completely under,' Mrs Young told CBS.

She said Mr Young stuffed mattresses into a hole made by the whale, but had to bail out water for nine hours before the coast guard found him.

Mr Young is thought to still be on the freighter, which is heading for Panama, and his family hope he will be home in time for Father's day on Sunday.

There was a less happy ending for his yacht, however, which was last seen sinking.
