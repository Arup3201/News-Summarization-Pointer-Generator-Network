The NHS employs staff from more than 200 different countries, including Azerbaijan, Zambia, Indonesia, Poland, and American Samoa, according to official figures.

The records, recorded by the Health and Social Care Information Centre show that more than 1 in 10 workers are from overseas, including 25 per cent of doctors and 11 per cent of nurses. 

India is the biggest supplier of staff with 18,424, followed by the Philippines with 12,744, then Ireland and 12,613 and Poland, with 5,507.

Investigations have revealed that 40 out of 105 NHS trusts in the UK have actively recruited hospital staff from overseas

Lesser well known countries supplying staff include Guatamala, Kazakhstan, Sierra Leone and Timor.

Figures from the study show that a total of 204 different nations, excluding the UK, supply the NHS with 136,624 workers.

Some of Britain's doctors have warned that foreign staff do not always understand our healthcare system or culture, and often have a poor grasp of the language.

These doctors include Lord Winston, a fertility doctor who warned on the reliance of staff from different countries, saying they had often been trained in a 'completely different way'.

In addition, Professor J Meirion Thomas, a senior cancer specialist who works at Marsden Hospital in London, implied that junior doctors from overseas might not be of as high a standard.

The NHS employ staff from more than 200 foreign countries, which has put them under fire from medical professionals who believe that workers from overseas might not understand UK healthcare systems or culture

Busy emergency rooms could be threatened by staff that do not have a good enough grasp of the English language, but a halt on overseas hiring with the UK's lack of trained staff could cause the system to grind to a halt

However, Tim Finch, working at a think tank for the Institute for Public Policy Research pointed out that the health service would struggle to function without the high numbers of overseas workers.

He said: 'People are still attracted to work in the NHS.

'Without them we'd clearly be short - it would be hard to replace that number overnight.

'If the single thread of immigration policy is just to get the overall figure down by any means, you've got to look at the consequences of that on the NHS.'

In addition, speaking about doctors from overseas, a spokesman for the British Medical Association said: 'Overseas doctors have for many years made a valuable and important contribution to the NHS, especially in key
 services where there has been a historic shortage of UK trained 
doctors.

A member of medical think tank has said that the NHS could collapse if they stopped recruiting from abroad

â€˜This includes consultant posts in emergency care, 
haematology and old age psychiatry. Without the support of these doctors
 many NHS services would struggle to provide effective care to their 
patients.

â€˜It is essential that doctors treating patients in the 
UK are subject to proper checks on their language skills and clinical 
competence.

â€˜For many years the NHS actively encouraged overseas 
doctors to move to the UK, many of whom committed to a life here and 
have since become British citizens.'

Separate data from last year from 
the General Medical Council watchdog showed that the NHS recruits 
doctors from 143 different countries, including the nations of Liberia, 
Belize and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

In
 addition, an investigation last October found that one in three 
hospitals are turning to overseas countries for recruitment, including Poland, 
Greece, Spain, Portugal, India and the Philippines.

A freedom of information request by the Nursing Times found that 40 out of 105 hospital trusts have actively recruited from overseas in the last 12 months.
