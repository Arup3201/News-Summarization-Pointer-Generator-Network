Fernando has revealed he is studying Nemanja Matic in a bid to improve his own game as Manchester City's enforcer, ahead of the key clash with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.

The Brazilian, a summer signing from Porto, played against Matic on numerous occasions as the Serbian turned out for Benfica and calls his Premier League rival 'incredibly important' to Jose Mourinho's side. 

Saturday night's encounter between reigning champions and current league leaders has been billed as a title decider and much of the war will be won in midfield battles.

'It's a specific position and one that is really important for every team all over the world,' Fernando said of the holding role. 

'I played against Matic in Portugal several times and he is a really great player. He has so much quality.

'There are not many players like him left now, I think, but he is one of those I try to look at and learn from as I try to improve the way I play that role. 

'He is a player that has become incredibly important to Chelsea. I always try to watch these players in this position because there are so few left. I know I can learn from them.'

Fernando has come in for criticism in recent weeks and admits he is still adjusting to England. 

'It’s always hard to start a life in a new country, changing places and cultures,' he said. 'You are trying to adapt on the pitch and away from it, and with things like the language, that is always quite difficult.

'I have been here for six or seven months now, though, and I am starting to find a little bit of continuity in my work and getting used to things.

'It is a little different. The players here are always running. It is a very physical, very strong sort of football. It is very intense and I have suffered a bit because of that as I try to adapt.

'And then there are things like the conditions you have to play in: it snowed when we played against West Brom, and it rains a lot.

'I was prepared for that, though, and I knew that it would always be very difficult when we played away from home. These are all the things you have to adapt to, as well as your team and the league itself. 

'I am quite a physical player, a player who likes that part of the game, marking players, to help out his team, to provide support to the players in front of me.

'That was what made me want to take this opportunity, to see if I had the characteristics that suit English football.'
