In the report 133 cases of vandalism against Christian sites in 11 countries are documented.

In May 2013 the report states that anti-Christian graffiti was sprayed on the outside wall of a cathedral in Austria. The graffiti read 'We do not want your crosses' and included a swastika.

In France the altar of a church was set on fire while in another French church excrement was left on the altar.

In June 2013 when the Salvatorian monastery of Hörbranz in Vorarlberg was raided by two masked gunmen and the monk was held at gunpoint.

Other incidents include a bomb being planted in a Spanish church and a Molotov cocktail being thrown against the door of a church in Italy after it had been renovated.

The Observatory says that it has amassed the data after scouring local media and being contacted by people who have been directly affected.

Dr. Gudrun 
Kugler, director of the Observatory, said: 'The increasingly secular 
society in Europe has less and less space for Christianity.

'Some 
governments and players of civil society seek to exclude instead of to accommodate.

'Countless cases of intolerance against Christians are 
reported to us.

'By researching, documenting and publishing these cases we hope to create an awareness which is a first step towards a remedy.'
