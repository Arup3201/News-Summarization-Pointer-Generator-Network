Emma Duffy, 24, has battled anorexia since she was eight

An anorexic woman who has not eaten 
for a year could kill herself if the NHS stops treating her in 
hospital, her parents warned last night.

Emma
 Duffy – who has a personality disorder and has tried to commit suicide 
nine times – was said to be making good progress until health bosses 
ruled they would not fund the £1,000-a-day specialist care she needed.

Now
 the family of the 24-year-old have released pictures of her plight in 
an attempt to save her life because they are so disgusted with the NHS’s
 attitude.

During her 
16-year battle with anorexia, Miss Duffy has swallowed razor blades, has
 been admitted to hospital ‘hundreds of times’ and has been  repeatedly 
sectioned under the Mental Health Act.

Her parents have been warned on several occasions to prepare for her death after her organs began shutting down.

Now
 doctors at the hospital in Middlesbrough where she has been treated for
 six months have decided to discharge her.

As a result, she could be 
sent back into the community in days, weighing six stone and refusing 
all nutrients.

Miss Duffy, 
who has only had a liquid diet for the past year, was to have been sent 
to The Retreat clinic in York – one of the few units in the country  
that treats eating and personality disorders together.

Her consultant believed it could help her overcome anorexia and Miss Duffy was confident that it would save her life.

But she was told three weeks ago that the NHS would not fund the £1,000-a-day specialist care.

She then left the hospital, went by rail to Newcastle and took an overdose of pills.

Her family used tracking software on her phone to find her and save her life.

Her parents have now set up an internet appeal to raise £1million for three years of treatment.

Emma three years ago before signs of her eating disorder. Her mother says she also suffers from a personality disorder and has tried to commit suicide nine times

They
 are furious with the Health Service for its failure to help her 
effectively, even though her father, Alan, 57, works for  the NHS as a 
clinical engineering manager.

Mother
 Beverley, 51, has started the fundraising effort with her youngest 
daughter Amy, 20.

Mrs Duffy, of Chesterfield, Derbyshire, said Amy’s 
sister cannot be watched 24 hours a day at home and is likely to try to 
kill herself as soon as she can.

Emma aged eight, when she overheard a comment about her weight that triggered her 16-year battle with anorexia

She believes her daughter will also reject the community care doctors have decided to give her instead of treatment in hospital.

‘I
 think the attitude of the NHS is disgusting,’ said Mrs Duffy.

‘It comes
 down to money. She’s in a worse state now than she was when she was 
admitted to hospital. She has had all hope taken away from her. It’s not
 safe to discharge her.’

Her
 family says funding the expensive treatment to cure her would pay for 
itself by stopping her being a long-term burden on the NHS.

Mrs
 Duffy said her daughter had put on 11lb before she was told her place 
at The Retreat would not be funded, and is now refusing liquid 
nutrients.

‘She’s getting weaker and she needs help. I hope we can raise the money ourselves before it’s too late for her,’ she said.

The problems began when she was eight and heard a dance teacher say another girl was fat.

It triggered a lifelong battle against bulimia and anorexia, which she kept secret for years.

Mrs
 Duffy said: ‘It’s a mental illness, not just about eating.’

As a 
teenager, Miss Duffy was thin, fainted regularly and lost a lot of her 
hair. At 18, she finally admitted to her mother that she was making 
herself sick.

She attempted 
suicide last October and was admitted to Roseberry Park Hospital in 
Middlesbrough under the Mental Health Act and has been there since.

‘They
 don’t know what to do with her,’ Amy said.

‘The average stay on that 
ward is 21 days. It is a holding place. She needs to go somewhere where 
they can treat her eating disorder and her personality disorder.

‘It’s like they are trying to keep her alive, but not saving her.’

Tees,
 Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust said: ‘The responsibility for
 funding care placements rests with the commissioners of NHS services.’

Around 1.6million people in Britain suffer from eating disorders and a tenth of those are thought to have anorexia. The rest have bulimia or other disorders.

Its full name anorexia nervosa, it is often cited as the most lethal mental illness - with a larger ratio sufferers dying than those who have depression or psychosis.

Sufferers tend to focus on food but the illness itself stems from low self-esteem and an inability to cope safely with 
worries, problems and a lack of control.

Many who have anorexia lower their food intake by skipping 
meals and cutting down the types and amounts of food they eat; some over-exercise.

Aside from catastrophically severe weight loss, physical symptoms include difficulty sleeping, dizziness, stomach pains, constipation, feeling cold and hair loss.

Periods can stop for women and sufferers grow soft, fine hair all over their bodies in a condition called Lanugo.

Although researchers are given figures by hospitals around Britain, it is thought the real toll of sufferers could be much higher because many are reluctant to seek help.

One symptom is that sufferers shut themselves off from the world and convince themselves that what they are doing is right, even if they are dangerously underweight.

Nine out of ten people with an eating disorder are women - but NHS figures suggest there is a growing number of male sufferers.

Specialists tend to use psychological treatments such as counselling, though the most severe cases have to be treated in hospital to ensure patients regain weight safely.
