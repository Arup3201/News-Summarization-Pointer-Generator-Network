Wearing high heels can be more of an endurance test than a pleasure, especially during the a hectic party season.

A recent survey even revealed that more than a third of women said their feet had been so sore on a night out that they danced shoeless and walked home barefoot.

But one High Street store thinks it has the answer to our vertiginous stiletto woes.

Marks and Spencer has introduced Hi Heel Hosiery – tights with built-in pads which aim to alleviate the pain caused by stacked shoes.

Comfort first: M&S has unveiled a new range of tights called Hi Heel Hosiery which have built-in pads to alleviate pain in the balls of your feet

These clever new tights aim to make tired feet a thing of the past by eliminating pain on the ball of the foot leaving women free to wear their favourite heels all night long.

Speaking about the new hosiery, Paschal Little, Head of Lingerie Innovations, said: ‘The pads built into the bottom of the feet act as a cushion to relieve pain on the ball of the foot.

‘For additional comfort we have developed a shaped toe design which keeps the cushion in place.’

The
tights come in a variety of styles from classic opaque and natural to 
leopard print and sparkling diamante (perfect for the more 
fashion-forward women).

The tights, which are available in store this month, are priced between £6 and £15. 

Dance all night long: As well as the pads M&S has developed a shaped toe design which aims to keep the cushion in place so women can wear their favourite heels for longer

But will they actually help?

Kam Panesar, an osteopath at Adamina Spa, said: 'It sounds like the tights are just providing what Scholl and other foot specialists already do.

'They will make no difference to the rotation in the pelvis (that causes back and leg pain).

'If you tend to wear heels, however, they will allow you to wear high heels for a longer time with more comfort.

'So if you have no musculoskeletal problems and wear heels sporadically - they're a great buy!'.

Stylish: The range comes in a variety of designs
including spotted, £9.50 (left) animal, £12.50 (centre) and opaque,
