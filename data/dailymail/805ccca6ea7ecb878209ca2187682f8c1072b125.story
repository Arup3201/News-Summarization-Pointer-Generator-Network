Glamour model Chanelle Hayes launched into a foul mouthed tirade over Jade Goody's legacy, saying she is 'absolutely f***ing sick of living up to a ghost.'

Her comments come after OK! printed an interview with her boyfriend Jack Tweed - who married the tragic reality star just weeks before her death from cervical cancer in 2009 - saying 'noone could replace Jade.'

Former Big Brother contestant Chanelle, who has been in an on-off relationship with Jack since 2010, wrote on Twitter on Wednesday: 'Absolutely f***ing sick of living up to a ghost and never coming close. What's the point in the last three years of my life then?!'

'Sick of living up to a ghost': Chanelle's foul mouthed rant over her lover's tribute to Jade Goody was aimed at Tweed and glossy magazine OK!

Unhappy: Chanelle was not impressed with her boyfriend's gushing words over his dead wife Jade Goody

Her rant, which she later deleted, continued with the 24-year-old launching a tirade at the glossy magazine, accusing them of making her and son Blakely 'dispensable.'

She wrote: 'As usual a certain magazine has me and my son dispensable. Noone could replace her [Jade]. Of course. Thanks #twistingwords.'

Chanelle, who graces the cover of a lads magazine in a bra and pants this month, has been embroiled in many a Twitter row with her 25-year-old lover Tweed.

In love: Jack married Jade weeks before her death in 2009 - the reality star captured the heart of the nation as she faced her cancer battle four years ago

Undoubtedly Tweed's words to the glossy magazine, for its special anniversary issue upset Chanelle - who is mother to two-year-old Blakely, who was fathered by her former lover, Middlesbrough footballer Matthew Bates.

According to OK! Tweed said he never thought he would meet anyone after Jade's death.

He said: 'It’s still hard every day. You don’t get over it, you just get onto with it. No one could replace Jade. I don’t know how to put it. I’m lucky to have found someone. I didn’t think I would find anyone else again, but I have.’

Tweed goes on to pay tribute to Jade, who died aged just 27.

Rant: It's not the first time Chanelle has lashed out at Jack on Twitter

After being arrested and then acquited of rape in 2010, Tweed was banned from seeing Jade's two children by their father Jeff Brazier - something he doesn't blame the presenter for doing.

The full interview is available OK! magazine out now

He said: 'I still send birthday cards and
I still talk to Jade’s mates who see the boys and they say they still 
ask after me. It’s sad but they’re Jeff’s boys and I don’t want to cause
any grief. I don’t blame him, to be honest.’

This is by no means the first war of words between Chanelle and Tweed.

In August last year she posted a picture online which Tweed sent to her, showing him with blonde Playboy model Hannah Elizabeth.

Weeks later she wrote: 'So @JackTweed_ comes to try make it upto me and smashes up my front door, tells me he prefers having sex with dirty s**ts.

'That diseased dirty d**k has been in more s****s than I've had hot dinners. @JackTweed_ you have crushed me down so much.

'Apparently, sex everyday isn't enough for this dirty state. #f**koffuf***ingscumbag. I hate myself. No self confidence, no self respect.

'I disgust myself totally because of YOU. You're a vile sex addict horrid bully who has ruined my life. Go and f***ing die.'
