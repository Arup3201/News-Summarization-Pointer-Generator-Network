One Twitter user responded to the abuse and claimed the former prime minister was 'a far better person than you will ever be'

Other Twitter users claimed she had grown up to be 'an ignorant a***ole', and that she would 'go down as the worst PM in history'.

'Girls shouldn't have to do what you did to get on in the world, not a good example!', tweeted another. 

Several social media users were quick to jump to Ms Gillard's defence, labelling the comments 'bitter' and 'angry', and one Twitter user claimed the former prime minister was 'a far better person than you will ever be'. 

'Winning smile. Breaking glass ceilings in Australia for women and redheads,' tweeted one user, while another wrote, 'Congratulations. You are a great role model for all young females!' 

Ms Gillard tweeted the photo as part of  A World At School's project 'Up for School', an international campaign to achieve the Millennium Goal of seeing all children in school.

The project cites a statistic of 58 million children still out of school, and ahead of International Women's Day on March 8, Ms Gillard, who has long been outspoken about the disadvantages women face.

Social media users abused the former prime minister after she posted a photo of herself at school

'I want to see a future where every girl is educated and empowered to reach their full potential, just like I was. I’m sharing my school photo in solidarity with the 31 million girls around the world who are still denied the right to go to school,' Ms Gillard wrote about her post. 

Ms Gillard, who is well-known for her 'misogyny' speech, spoke at the NAB Women’s Agenda Leadership Awards ceremony about the importance of encouraging girls in education and women into leadership positions.

'It is a universal truism in development, when you speak to people in the global development community, that if you want to change the society, educate a girl,' Ms Gillard said.

'If you educate a girl, then she will have the empowerment and the economic freedoms, which come with that education, when she moves into the labour market, and more choices about how and when to have her children, she will choose to have less children, and have them later in her life,' reported Business Insider. 

'In this great country where we enjoy so many remarkable privileges, I feel very intensely the obligation to make sure we are reaching out to our neighbours and helping them educate their girls… who are most likely to be left behind.'
