Screen stars partied with the rich, the powerful and the President of the United States at the 100th White House Correspondents' Dinner.

Besides his wife Michelle looking glamorous at his side, Obama had no shortage of female company at one of the most star-studded events in the national calendar.

Jessica Simpson, Charmed actress Rose McGowan, 12 Years a Slave Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o and Modern Family star Sofia Vergara were among the beautiful and famous who hobnobbed with the capital's elite at the Washington Hilton last night.

The black-tie night is a traditional chance for the President to let down his guard and poke fun at his own regime.

But it has also become a night of celebrity-spotting, home to the biggest names in film and fashion all out to impress before the cameras.

Congressmen and cabinet members rubbed elbows with Hollywood stars including 12 Years a Slave director Steve McQueen.

Joel McHale, star of the NBC comedy 
Community, followed Obama with a routine that had New Jersey Governor 
Chris Christie's weight as its biggest target.

Gravity director Alfonso Cuaron was a guest, as was actress Diane Lane. Television stars included Olivia Munn of The Newsroom and Juliana Margulies of The Good Wife.

Julia Louis-Dreyfus was there with the cast from her hit HBO comedy Veep, parodying a dysfunctional vice president's office.

A video played earlier in the evening showed her in character, asking a real-life Joe Biden: 'Are you going to the Snorespondents' dinner tonight?'

Demure: Russian supermodel Irina Shayk, best known for her appearances in Sports Illustrated, was one guest

Date: Sex and the City's Cynthia Nixon came to the pre-party with her wife, education activist Christine Marinoni

Celeb-spotting: Pop star and former American Idol contestant Katharine McPhee arrived in a coral pink dress

The video skit included health-conscious first lady Michelle Obama sneaking some ice cream in the White House kitchen, House of Representatives Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi getting a tattoo and House Speaker John Boehner skipping the dinner to watch a panda video in his office.

The skit ended with a joke on the Hollywood-Washington romance, as Louis-Dreyfus explains slowly to Biden: 'I'm not really a V.P. but you are. I'm an actress from Hollywood.'

From the bungled rollout of 'Obamacare' to New Jersey gridlock to the hue of John Boehner's tan, all was fair game for Obama when he took center stage as comedian in chief.

His smiling face appearing on huge screens above the hundreds of guests, he chuckled: 'We rolled out healthcare.gov. That could have gone better.

'In 2008 my slogan was "Yes we can." In 2013 my slogan was "control-alt-delete".'

On the plus side, the president said, 'they did turn the launch of healthcare.gov into one of the year's biggest movies.' On the screen flashed the poster for Frozen.

Big audience: It was the 100th anniversary of the dinner, one of the biggest traditions for the Washington political corps, and as always the President shone the brightest in a star-studded audience

When a video Obama introduced failed to play properly, he asked, 'Does anybody know how to fix this?'

To laughter, the out-going Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius stepped up and said: 'I got this. I see it all the time.'

The President also wasted no time turning his jokes toward the media.

'MSNBC is here,' he said. 'They're a little overwhelmed. They've never seen an audience this big before.'

Noting that he had traveled to Asia recently, Obama said: 'The lengths we have to go to to get CNN coverage these days. I think they're still searching for their table.'

The president saved his sharpest jabs for another cable news network.

'The Koch brothers bought a table here tonight, but as usual they used a shadowy right-wing organization as a front,' he said. 'Hello, Fox News!

'Let's face it, Fox. You'll miss me when I'm gone. It will be harder to convince the American people that Hillary was born in Kenya.'

Obama took a swipe at Fox News during his speech, saying the network will miss him when he's gone

Republicans - and Bridgegate - didn't escape untouched. 'Washington seems more dysfunctional than ever,' Obama said. 'Gridlock has gotten so bad in this town you have to wonder: What'd we do to piss off Chris Christie so bad?'

Journalists were honored at the event for their coverage of the presidency and national issues:

Glenn Thrush of Politico and Brianna Keilar of CNN won the Aldo Beckman Award, which recognizes excellence in the coverage of the presidency.

Peter Baker of The New York Times and Peter Maer of CBS News won the Merriman Smith Award for deadline coverage.

Megan Twohey of Reuters and a partnership between The Center for Public Integrity's Chris Hamby and ABC News' Matthew Mosk and Brian Ross won the Edgar A. Poe Award for coverage of issues of national significance.

And George E. Condon Jr. of National Journal received the first President's Award for exceptional service to the organization.

The organization also honored the late Harry McAlpin, the first black reporter to attend a presidential news conference, by establishing a scholarship in his name.

McAlpin had been denied membership to the WHCA while covering the Roosevelt and Truman administrations because of his race.
