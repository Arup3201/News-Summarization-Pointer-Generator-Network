Headteachers are under pressure from police leaders to let officers’ children go on holiday during term-time.

Headteachers are under pressure from police leaders to let officers' children go on holiday during term-time

Strict new rules mean parents can be fined a minimum of £60 for taking children out of classes without permission and they face jail if they refuse to pay.

Schools have been told not to let pupils miss lessons unless in ‘exceptional circumstances’, such as a family funeral.

But police leaders believe the rules, 
brought in by Education Secretary Michael Gove, are unfair on officers 
who are barred from taking annual leave during the summer.

Rank-and-file police from the mainland 
are regularly sent to keep order during July’s marching season in 
Northern Ireland, and major events such as this year’s Commonwealth 
Games in Glasgow often take place in school holidays.

Britain’s seaside resorts and cities are 
also thronged with tourists during the summer months, while there are at
 least 12,000 fewer officers to patrol the streets than before the 
Election because of budget cuts.

But officers who take family holidays 
during term-time face a fixed penalty notice of £60 per pupil and 
parents who do not pay risk being fined £2,500 or being jailed for three
 months.

Under the new rules, police must tell their force’s Professional Standards Department if they are fined for taking their children out of school, which could see them disciplined for misconduct.

Branches of the Police Federation are asking councils around the country to ensure officers are spared the term-time holiday fines.

Steve Evans, the Police Federation’s 
spokesman on professional standards, said: ‘People in all walks of life 
have difficulty getting leave, but it seems perverse to punish somebody 
for doing what the Government is effectively requesting them to do.’

A Department for Education spokesman said it was letting schools set flexible term dates to help parents fit in holidays
