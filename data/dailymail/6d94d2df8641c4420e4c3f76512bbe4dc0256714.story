A double decker bus had its roof ripped off when it crashed into a railway bridge today - the second incident of its kind at the same bridge in just five months.

Fortunately no one was injured when the entire top section of the bus was taken off as it tried to go under a railway bridge near Porchester Railway Station, Hampshire.

An identical incident happened in September when another double decker, worth up to Â£300,000 when bought new, crashed into the bridge.

Wrecked: A double decker bus had its roof ripped off after it collided with a railway bridge in Porchester, Hampshire, earlier today

Write-off: The roof of the bus lies blocking the road in Porchester, Hampshire today

Fortunately, the 45-year-old driver was the only one on board at the time and he was treated by paramedics for shock at the scene.

The roof came crashing down onto the road when the bus collided with the bridge at 9.41am.

Police closed Station Road, Portchester, after local fire crews were sent to the scene.

The brick and metal bridge is clearly signed as being 3.6 metres high - a double decker bus measures four metres.

Local resident Mrs Pat Tiller said: 'The top of the bus has gone and they have put a white cover over it. The trains have been stopped and traffic is diverted.

'I can't understand how it has happened again. Surely it is obvious that a double-decker bus will not go under that bridge.'

A spokeswoman from First Group, which owns both buses, said: 'We are as concerned by this incident as we suspect other local people will be.

Safety checks: Workers survey the bridge to check if it is damaged after the bus collided with it this morning

Clean up: Workers and emergency crews begin to clear up mess and debris left by the bus crash

'The exact cause of it is being investigated and the appropriate action will be taken as a result.

'In relation to the previous incident, the cause of that was determined to be human error and the appropriate action was taken as a result.

'As a company we take the safety of our staff, customers and other road users extremely seriously.

'Incidents such as this are rare and it is unusual for two similar incidents to happen in the same place.

'Thankfully the vehicle was not in service at the time of the incident, so while the bus has been badly damaged there were no recorded injuries as a result of the collision.'

A Hampshire Police spokesperson said: 'A double-decker bus has crashed into a railway bridge and the roof has been removed.

'Police and fire crews attended the scene to help the driver and shut Station Road in Portchester.

'British Rail Maintenance are also doing their best to help the situation, and work will be done immediately to make sure the bridge is safe.'

Emergency: Fire crews were called to the scene and the road was closed off after the bus hit the railway bridge near Porchester Station

Damage: The seats on the top deck of the bus are littered with glass and debris after this morning's crash
