Apology: Australian prime minister Julia Gillard has apologised for the forced adoptions scandal

The Australian government has finally apologised for the scandal of the forced adoptions that took place between the 1950s and the 1980s when hundreds of single mothers were made to give up their babies to married couples.  

Victims of the controversial programme, which saw newborns taken away before their mothers even had a chance to hold them in their arms, wept and hugged one another as newly re-elected Prime Minister Julia Gillard formally said sorry.

More than 800 children and parents harmed through the programme gathered in Canberra to hear Miss Gillard tell them that the parliament took responsibility and apologised for the policies and practices that tore mothers from their babies.

The policy, she said in a powerful, emontionally-charged speech, ‘created a lifelong legacy of pain and suffering.’

It was, she told them, ‘a wound that would not heal.’

The crowd applauded as she told the tearful gathering: ‘We deplore the shameful practices that denied you, the mothers, your fundamental rights and responsibilities to love and care for your children.’

They had not been legally or socially acknowledged as the mothers of children taken from them and as a result were deprived of care and support.

‘You were given false assurances, you were forced to endure the coercion and brutality of practices that were unethical, dishonest and in many cases illegal.’

Miss Gillard said: 'Friends, as the time for birth came, these babies would be snatched 
away before they had even held them in their arms.

‘Sometimes, consent was achieved by 
forgery or fraud. Sometimes women signed adoption papers whilst under 
the influence of medication.

‘Most common of all was the bullying arrogance of a society that presumed to know what was best.

‘The hurt did not simply last for a few days or weeks. This was a wound that would not heal.’

Among the children who were taken were those who suffered sexual abuse at the hands of their adoptive parents or institutions.

Many mothers had been drugged and 
shackled to their beds in a practice carried out by government 
officials, hospitals, churches and charities.

Angela Barra, 45, who had been involved in the campaign to get the Australian government to apologise, was herself adopted as a newborn.

She was reunited with her natural mother 20 years ago after responding to a newspaper phone in.

In an interview with ABC she said: 'I've personally never liked being adopted. I didn't like being special and I was told I was a special child.

'I remember as a teenager having conversations with mum and she always spoke lovingly about my natural mother she always said she must have loved you very much to give you up.

'As a young person you don't really understand how that makes sense because at a subconscious level and as an adult I can articulate that conflict in me but I didn't have the words for it when I was young it came out more in my behaviour.'

'But if she loved me so much then why did she give me up?' 

Speaking outside the hall following the apology, she said: 'A lot of upset mothers in there lost their children because of demand for babies.

'People were forced to give their babies up; they were drugged, they were shackled to their beds ... they didn't relinquish their babies; their babies were taken.'

As part of her apology, Miss Gillard 
announced that $5 million (£3.4 million) would be provided to improve 
access to specialist support and to help records-tracing and mental 
health care for those affected by forced adoption.

In a report released last year, the 
Senate said there had been as many as 150,000 adoptions between 1951 and
 1975, but it was impossible to know how many were forced.

The seven-member Senate committee 
began investigating the federal government's role in forced adoption in 
2010 after the Western Australian state parliament apologised to mothers
 and children for the flawed practices in that state from the 1940s 
until the 1980s.

Western Australia was the first of 
five state and territory governments to apologise for forced adoption. 
Australia has eight such governments.

Miss Christine Cole, head of the 
Apology Alliance, set up to help forced-adoption victims, said after the
 Prime Minister’s speech that the apology had been a long time coming.

‘I had my baby taken from me in 1969 
and I think the use of the term “forced adoption” polarises the actual 
phenomena of what was going on,’ she said.

‘What was going on was kidnapping 
children, kidnapping newborn babies from their mothers at the birth, 
using pillows and sheets to cover their face, drugging them as I was 
drugged, with drugs like sodium pentothal, chloral hydrate and other 
mind-altering barbiturates.

‘It was cruel, it was punitive and 
then often the mother was transported, like I was, away from the 
hospital so you had no access to your baby.'

Despite the Prime Minister’s apology 
being mostly welcomed, one woman who identified herself only as ‘Sydney’
 said her husband’s adopted parents were told by a social worker in 1972
 that his mother was a 15-year-old girl who had a boyfriend at school 
and who was unable to keep her baby.

But her husband had found out just 
this week that the mother was in fact 19-years-old from a farming 
community and was the victim of a rape.

When her husband, who had been raised
 to believe that his parents brought him into the world with love, found
 out the truth about his background, Sydney said ‘he burst out crying’.

She added: ‘His birth mother didn’t know who the birth father was. He was a predator. Social workers all along had been lying.’

National shame: Unwed mothers were pressured, deceived and threatened into giving up their babies

Liberal opposition leader Tony Abbot 
said: ‘I cannot imagine a grief greater than that of a parent and a 
child parted from one another.’

The announcement comes just a few 
weeks after the Irish government apologised for Magdalene homes scandal 
in which thousands of young women were forcibly placed in catholic-run 
asylums which were little more than workhouses.

Around 30,000 Irish women were sent 
to the homes, also known as the Magdelene Laundries, where physical, 
sexual and emotional abuse at the hands of nuns and priests who ran them
 was said to be rife.
