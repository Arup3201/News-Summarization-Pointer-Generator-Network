Pope Francis condemned ISIS attacks on Christians and other religions minorities in Iraq and Syria during a speech in Turkey today.

The pontiff also reached out to Muslim leaders, by urging them to take a stronger stand against terrorists who use religion to justify their heinous actions.

As he landed in the capital of Ankara on Friday, the pope reaffirmed that military force was justified to stop ISIS, but called for greater dialogue between people of all faiths to end fundamentalism.

Word of peace: Pope Francis condemned the actions of ISIS and said that although Muslim leaders need to take stronger stand on religious terrorism, greater inter-faith dialogue is needed

Pope Francis sought to offer a balanced message as he met with Turkish officials upon his arrival in Ankara, his second trip to the Middle East this year. 

'Fanaticism and fundamentalism, as well as irrational fears which foster misunderstanding and discrimination, need to be countered by the solidarity of all believers,' Francis told Turkish officials at President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's massive new presidential palace.

Francis praised Turkey's welcome of some 1.6 million refugees and said the international community had the 'moral obligation' to help Ankara provide for them.

The three-day visit comes at a sensitive moment for the Muslim nation, as it weighs how to respond to the Islamic State advance amid U.S. calls to get more engaged with the international coalition fighting the extremists.

Turkey has accused ISIS of casting a shadow over Islam and has said Muslim countries have a duty to stand up against the group's radical views.

Peace keeper: Pope Francis sought to offer a balanced message as he met with Turkish officials upon his arrival in Ankara, his second trip to the Middle East this year 

The pope is on a three-day visit to Turkey with the delicate mission of strengthening ties with Muslim leaders while condemning violence against Christians and other minorities in the Middle East 

Turkey is still negotiating with the United States over how and to what extent it will be helping the coalition in its battle against ISIS.

Erdogan has been pressing for a safe haven and a no-fly zone along the Syrian border with Turkey and also wants the coalition to go after Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime.

Sensitive to the delicacy of the geopolitical issues at play, Pope Francis treaded lightly in his opening remarks, not pressing any overtly political statement.

The pope was greeted at Ankara's Esenboga Airport by a line of Turkish dignitaries, headed by Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, as he descended the steps of his plane. 

He inspected and greeted Turkish honor guards before heading to the mausoleum of the Turkish republic's founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, where he laid a wreath.

'My wish is that Turkey, which is a natural bridge between the two continents, is not just a point of intersection, but at the same time a point where men and women belonging to all cultures, ethnicity and religion live together in dialogue,' Francis wrote in a guest book at the mausoleum.

Beyond the geopolitical issues, the three-day visit will give Francis a chance to reach out to Turkey's tiny Christian community - less than one percent of Turks is Catholic - and visit with the spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I.

Francis will tour two of Istanbul's most impressive sites, the Hagia Sofia - the Byzantine church-turned-mosque that is now a museum - and the nearby Sultan Ahmet mosque, Turkey's most important place of Muslim worship. The Vatican's plans call for him to pause in the mosque for a moment of 'reflection.' 

The Vatican added a speech to Francis' itinerary Sunday at an event in which some Syrian refugees are expected to attend. The absence of any meeting with a group of refugees had raised eyebrows given that Francis had met with refugees in Jordan and in the Palestinian territories and has made welcoming refugees a major thrust of his papacy.
