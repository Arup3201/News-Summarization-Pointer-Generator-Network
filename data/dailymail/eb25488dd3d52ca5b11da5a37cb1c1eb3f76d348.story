Since shooting to fame as Mark Wright's fiance on The Only Way Is Essex back in 2010, Lauren Goodger has seen her star - and her confidence - rise.

As well as enjoying a stint on Celebrity Big Brother and Dancing On Ice, the 28-year-old has successfully launched her own cosmetics company, Lauren's Way.

But the reality TV star-turned-entrepreneur wants to put her newfound confidence and sense of style to good use - by designing a clothing range.

Big plans: Lauren Goodger found fame on TOWIE back in 2010 and now she wants to grow her empire by launching a clothing range

Speaking about what she's got coming up, Lauren told MailOnline: 'I would love my own clothing range that's different and caters for curvy sexy girls.'

Lauren would be following in the footsteps of her former castmates Gemma Collins, Sam Faiers and Amy Childs, who all have their own fashion ranges.

The blonde star also revealed the secret behind the toned body she's been flaunting in her recent social media snaps. 

So THAT's her secret! Lauren, who has been showcasing her toned physique on social media in recent weeks, says her newfound love of dancing helps her stay in shape

Speaking about her healthy new lifestyle, she explained: 'I try and work out as much as I can and eat healthily, which can be hard with my busy schedule. I love dancing, so that’s a great way to stay toned.'

And Lauren has certainly been putting her newly acquired dancing skills to good use in her Instagram videos, where she can often be seen gyrating and twerking to the camera. 

Lauren is also something of a beauty buff and has her own range of tanning products, lashes and hair extensions under the name of Lauren's Way.

The glamorous star has  been amping up her beauty regime recently - and she swears by chemical peels for beating her acne.

Beauty buff: Lauren, who has her own range of lashes and tan, has been getting chemical peels to treat her acne and sun damage 

She said: 'I’m always trying various treatments so when I heard about the The Perfect Peel I had to give it ago.

'It’s basically a chemical face peel that takes just 15 minutes, I visited a London clinic to have it done as it is a strong treatment but it was pain free (which surprised me) and the results you just can’t get with any products at home.

'I had mine done which can help with acne and sun damage. After my recent trip to Dubai my skin was in need of some TLC, so I had it to clear my skin and remove any dead skin or pigmentation that the sun caused. It's a deeper treatment which makes your skin clear and glowing, I see it as an investment.' 

Look good, feel good: The 28-year-old say she has no judgement on anyone who wants to better themselves by having cosmetic surgery 

As well as peels, Lauren says she loves getting her eyebrows done. 'Eyebrows really shape your face so it’s important to have strong great brows. I also recently had a Lava Shell massages as it helps me relax and wind down after a long day, running a business can be quite stressful at times,' she added.

And the beauty buff is all for cosmetic surgery if it makes you feel more confident. 

She said: 'I have no judgement on anyone who wants to better themselves and everyone wants to feel good and everyone should feel good.'

Lauren and her girl pals enjoyed a night out at the KISS FM Haunted House party in London on Friday night, all dressed in typically risque outfits.
