A Massachusetts man said he was in 'complete shock' upon discovering that he was likely the father of at least two of four children authorities took from the house he shared with his girlfriend, and where the corpses of three infants were discovered.

That man is the live-in boyfriend of Erika Murray, 31, now being held on felony charges including concealing fetal death and permitting substantial injury to a child after in the wake of the horrific August discovery of three infant corpses in the house on 23 St. Paul Street.

Ramon Rivera III's reaction was relayed to reporters by a friend who wished to remain anonymous but said he spoke with the accused shortly after Rivera met with the state Department of Children and Families.

The live-in boyfriend of Erika Murray, 31, says he was shocked to learn he's likely the father of her four surviving children

The anonymous source told The Boston Globe that for the last three years he had a regular seat at a card game held in Rivera and Murray's basement.

On August 28, four living children ages 5 months and 3, 10 and 13 years were taken from the home.

They are now under the supervision of the Department of Children and Families.

The remains of the infant corpses were discovered on Wednesday and Thursday.

Rivera was asked to meet with authorities shortly after the bodies were recovered.

Simply cleaning the home took 90 hours at an estimated cost of $25,000.

Upon learning that the two youngest children were definitely his - and that the older two likely were as well - Rivera's friend said he was 'in absolute, complete shock.'

'Just like everyone else, he also thinks he should have known. She had everybody fooled,' the anonymous source said.

Rivera is charged with growing marijuana in the house's basement.

He has not, however, been charged in connection to the squalid conditions on the house's second floor where the children were kept.

'He wants the truth to be his support,' the friend said.

Rivera also claimed to have been ignorant of the second floor's state as he often slept on the couch in the basement.

There is a separate basement entrance that Rivera and his friend regularly used for card games.

Murray had recently started working at Shaw's after a job at McDonald's where she and Rivera had both worked.

While she had recently lost weight, friends say her home wasn't as bad as authorities have reported.

'She seemed a little lost,' said former co-worker Sabrina Wilson, 29. 'Like she was missing something.'

Wilson agreed that Rivera spent most of his time in the basement, retreating from the family.

'He'd get home, give her a kiss, talk to the kids, see how their day at school was, and go to the basement,' she said.

Police have been called to the house for several incidents over the last decade.

Calls at the house resulted in reports on several occasions between October 2000 and March 2007, often relating to Rivera.

The house is owned by Rivera's sister, Kristin Rivera.

Calls at the house resulted in reports on several occasions between October 2000 and March 2007, often relating to Rivera.

In May 2005 she was listed as 'calling party' in an incident where a child playing with the phone dialed 911.

Another child's absence from school resulted in a police call in 2005.

Murray talked to police about a 'medical transport of another party' in 2007.

She called police again in May to complain about a dead cat on the sidewalk.

'While we will all wonder what could have been done to prevent this terrible tragedy, our officers continued to do their jobs well, and no one could have predicted the scene that investigators would find last week,' said Police Chief Ross Atstupenas.
