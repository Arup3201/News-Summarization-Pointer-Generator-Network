It's been 25 years since Spike Lee released his iconic film Do The Right Thing and around 25 years since President Obama and his wife Michelle Obama went to see that same film on their first date.

In celebration of the 25th anniversary of Do the Right Thing, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art held a screening, a reception, and a Q &A with Spike Lee, and a special surprise from The White House, reports Jezebel.

Before the film began, Lee announced that he had a treat for the audience--a touching message from the President of the United States and the First Lady.

'Do the Right Thing was actually the first movie we saw together, on our first official date’, said Michelle Obama.

The President then spoke about how he picked a movie by a director that not many people knew about yet but that it was supposed to be a great film.

The couple spent the day having lunch at the Art Institute of Chicago then made their way over the movie theater.

'He was trying to show me his sophisticated side by selecting an independent filmmaker, and it ended up being a pretty good movie,' said Michele with a smile.

'So Spike, thank you for helping me impress Michelle, and thank you for telling a powerful story,' spoke the President.

Obama joked that he has more grey hairs than he did back in 1989 and he quipped that Spike Lee no longer looks like 'Mookie' but that Spike's message still stands strong.

'Do the Right Thing still holds up a mirror to our society, and it makes us laugh, and think and challenges all of us to see ourselves in one another,' said the President.

'It's really a testament to your vision and to everyone who helped you make this movie possible, including the great Ruby Dee, who we will remember always,' said Michele Obama.
