The Army will be left at its weakest since 1750 after Philip Hammond announced the biggest shake-up for a century.

Despite admitting troops' morale was 'fragile', the Defence Secretary ploughed ahead with axing some of the most distinguished battalions – including those serving in Afghanistan.

The plan will contribute to reducing Army personnel from 102,000 to 82,000 – its lowest level in more than 250 years and just half the 163,000 servicemen it boasted during the Falklands conflict. The number of Ministry of Defence civil servants is as many as 80,000.

Mr Hammond caused outrage by telling soldiers from the 2nd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment (Green Howards) that their unit was being axed as they battle the Taliban. About 50 are attached to the 3rd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment on the front line.

And hundreds of troops serving in Helmand with the 1st Battalion The Royal Tank Regiment were informed they will be merged.

The cull also hit the historic 2nd Battalion the Royal Welsh, which traces its roots to the battle of Rorke's Drift in 1879, where seven of its men won Victoria Crosses for their stand against the Zulus.

In total, 17 major Army units – some dating back more than 300 years – will be lost under the reforms, described by Mr Hammond as a 'vision for the future'.

But top brass accused him of 'taking a risk' with Britain's security while Labour said the reorganisation was a 'military gamble'.

The Royal Welsh, which was created in 2006 by the amalgamation of the
Royal Regiment of Wales and the Royal Welch Fusiliers, can trace its 
history back to the defiant stand at Rorke’s Drift during the Zulu War –
at which it won seven VCs.

At the time – in 1878 – the unit was known as the 24th Regiment of Foot – or the Warwicks.

That historic regiment, which started life as Colonel Dering’s in 1689, became the South Wales Borderers in 1881 and won many honours in The Boer War and the world wars.

In Brecon, the South Wales Borderers' museum tells the story of Rorke's Drift along with an exhibition of all the Victoria Cross medals won by the regiment in its long history.

In the Zulu War Room, the exploits of the 24th Regiment, known by Queen Victoria as 'the Noble 24th' during the 1879 war are recorded, along with the events surrounding the defence of Rorke's Drift by B Company of the 2nd Battalion, the famous event recorded in the 1960s Sir Stanley Baker film Zulu.

The decision to axe the 2nd Battalion means its 640 members based 
Tidworth in Wiltshire face an uncertain future.

The MoD said staff will 
be merged with the regiment's 1st Battalion.

Lib Dem MP Sir Bob Russell told Mr Hammond he would 'go down in history as the man who hammered the Army'.

The Defence Secretary announced the 
Army 2020 overhaul yesterday after postponing the cuts for four months. 
The Army will end up at its smallest since 1750, when it had 78,900 men.

Four infantry units will be disbanded 
–  the 2nd Battalion the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, which in an 
earlier incarnation  won six VCs 'before breakfast' at Gallipoli, and 
the 3rd Battalion the Mercian Regiment (Staffordshire) joining the 2 
Royal Welsh  and 2 Yorks.

A fifth, the Argyll and Sutherland 
Highlanders, 5th Battalion the Royal Regiment of Scotland, will be 
reduced to 120 soldiers performing ceremonial duties at Edinburgh Castle
and Holyrood.

And critics blasted the decision to 
save all five Scottish cap badges – which struggle to recruit enough 
troops – at the expense of English ones, calling it a 'shabby political 
fix' to avoid handing a propaganda coup to Alex Salmond's 
pro-independence nationalists.

Two cavalry units will be lost when 
the Queen's Royal Lancers merge with the 9th/12th Royal Lancers and the 
1st and 2nd Royal Tank Regiments are combined.

The Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers, 
Army Air Corps, Royal Logistic Corps, Royal Electrical and Mechanical 
Engineers and Royal Military Police will also be cut. The first units 
will be axed next year.

Mr Hammond said the changes were 'difficult and 
challenging' but were needed to create a 'best-in-class Army'. He 
defended the cuts despite admitting the UK faced an 'increasingly 
uncertain world'.

Cuts: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond in the House of Commons today 
where he announced that the Army is to lose 17 major units in a cost-cutting service 
overhaul which will reduce the Army by 20,000

Impact:
Soldiers from the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, 5th Battalion The 
Royal Regiment of Scotland (pictured) will have their battalion reduced 
in number and will have to perform ceremonial duties instead

This is the full list of unit changes announced today by Defence Secretary Philip Hammond.

The infantry will be reduced by five battalions - with the withdrawal of the 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, the 2nd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment (Green Howards), 3rd Battalion The Mercian Regiment (Staffords), and the 2nd Battalion The Royal Welsh (The Royal Regiment of Wales).

The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, 5th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland will be reduced to a public duties company.

The Armoured Corps is cut by two units with The Queen's Royal Lancers amalgamating with 9th/12th Royal Lancers (Prince of Wales's) and the merger of 1st and 2nd Royal Tank Regiment.

The Royal Artillery will be reduced from 13 to 12 units with the withdrawal of the 39th Regiment Royal Artillery.

The Royal Engineers will be reduced from 14 to 11 units with the withdrawal of 24 and 28 Engineer Regiments and 67 Works Group.

The Army Air Corps will reduce from five to four units as 1 Regiment AAC merges with 9 Regiment AAC.

The Royal Logistic Corps will be reduced from 15 to 12 units with 1 and 2 Logistic Support Regiments withdrawn from the Order of Battle and 23 Pioneer Regiment disbanded.

The Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers will be reduced to seven units with the withdrawal of 101 Force Support Battalion.

5 Regiment Royal Military Police will be removed.

He said the Government had inherited a
£38billion overspend from Labour. 'We have had to make tough decisions 
to implement our vision of a formidable, adaptable and flexible armed 
forces,' he said.

'We need to transform the Army and 
build a balanced, capable and adaptable force ready to face the future. 
It will be set on a firm foundation of men and material, well trained, 
well equipped and fully funded.'

On the axing of the battalions, he 
said: 'It is a difficult process. I understand the attachments of the 
regions and nations to specific units in the British Army and the 
justifiable pride they have in those units.

'But it is absolutely clear this is 
about delivering a war-fighting machine. While recognising and honouring
the golden history, our first priority must be looking resolutely to 
the future.' Ministers want to double the Territorial Army's size to 
30,000 and he admitted that persuading businesses to allow that many 
employees to join as reservists would be crucial.

Labour's defence spokesman Jim Murphy 
described the plan as a 'military gamble'. He said: 'Jobs and military 
capability have been lost and tradition and history have been 
sacrificed.

'This isn't just a smaller Army, it's also a less powerful 
Army in a less influential nation.'

Mr Murphy said that the Argyll and 
Sutherland Highlanders were being reduced to 'guarding castles and being
the back drop to Japanese tourists' photographs'.

General Lord Dannatt, former head of 
the Army, said troops would no longer be capable of two operations at 
the same time, such as in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Under the reforms, the Army will split into three: reaction forces, adaptable forces and force troops.

The reaction forces will be prepared for speedy interventions and made up of three brigades including the Parachute Regiment.

The adaptable forces will be dedicated to longer-term engagements, including the Falklands.

And the force troops will be made up 
of frontline support soldiers such as the artillery, engineers, signals,
intelligence and medical corps.

Opinion: The Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Peter Wall, said that under 
the plan, the Army would become 'better integrated and fully adaptable' while former Army chief Lord Dannatt, right, said the cuts were 'risky'

Three soldiers shot dead in Afghanistan by a man wearing Afghan Army uniform were today repatriated.

The trio, members of an Afghan Police advisory team, were killed on July 1 after helping organise a meeting of elders at Checkpoint Kamparack Pul in Nahr-e-Saraj, Helmand Province.

They received first aid at the scene but died of their injuries. A man believed to be responsible for the shooting is in custody, the MoD said.

Today, Guardsmen Craig Roderick and Apete Saunikalou Ratumaiyale Tuisovurua, of the 1st Battalion the Welsh Guards, and Warrant Officer Leonard Thomas, of the Royal Corps of Signals, were flown into RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire.

After a private ceremony their cortege passed the memorial garden before heading to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford.

WO2 Thomas, 44, was on his final tour in Afghanistan, having served since 1990 in units including the Coldstream and Welsh Guards before joining the RCS.

Cardiff-born Guardsman Roderick, 22, was a trainee bricklayer before joining the Welsh Guards in September 2009, based in Aldershot.

Fijian Guardsman Tuisovurua, 28, had been a soldier for little more than a year, having finished his training and joined the regiment in June 2011, based in Hounslow, west London.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond described the attack on the soldiers as 'cowardly'.Four other British soldiers have died in similar circumstances so far this year.

The Ministry of Defence said there had been 16 'green on blue' UK fatalities since 2008, including the seven killed this year. In 2011, there was only one such death.

Prime Minister David Cameron has condemned the killings and said the Government would do everything in its power to see that the gunman was brought to justice.
