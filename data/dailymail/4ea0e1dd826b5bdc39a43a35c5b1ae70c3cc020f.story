A fun day at the arcade turned violent Saturday as an all-out brawl erupted between warring factions of mothers at a Chuck E Cheese.

And the punch heard ‘round the Commack, Long Island party venue was thrown by a woman still holding her baby.

At least half a dozen other tough ladies threw their hats into the ring, some while their own children tried to pull them out.

Devolved: An argument, apparently over the purse a woman is seen snatching out from under another's foot (left) becomes an all-out brawl in children's party venue Chuck E. Cheese

It is unclear what started the fight. At the start of footage taken of the incident, two women argued.

A third woman appeared and tried snatching away a purse one of the arguing ladies seemed intent on keeping secured with her foot.

‘You’re out of control man,’ someone yelled in the background.

Not over: One woman curses and storms out, left, but then returns shortly carrying a baby and ready for a fight

Hold my baby! After throwing the first punch and throwing the place into chaos while still holding her baby, the woman hands the child off to a friend and briefly continues to brawl

Sirens whirred and a recorded voice sang 'Happy Birthday' to a group off-camera.

The nonsensical scene quickly became even more confused as a group of angry women stormed out.

A lecturing voice followed just behind one of the women as she left, ‘The children! Children!’

Insult to irony: A child is even seen trying to pry an adult out of the fight as the Happy Birthday song is heard in the background

Before long, she came back, holding a baby with one hand and pointing an accusatory finger with the other.

Two groups faced off as a frantic manager stood in between.

While still holding her baby, the mother who just couldn’t walk away threw a punch and all hell broke.

Women piled on women as a few men stood by, confused and helpless.

Hair was pulled and curse words were hurled.

One child even tries pulling a grown woman out of the melee.

It
is a moment to remember, if only for how shamefully the event played 
out while a cell phone video camera caught the blow by blow.

In
recent years numerous fights have broken out at venues across the 
country with footage of the shocking violence finding their way onto 
YouTube and into news reports.

One
incident in South Toledo saw one armed man pistol whip another after an
argument over someone using a loud horn in the venue.

Another featured a brawling pregnant woman.

As
for the most recent one, Long Island authorities are investigating the 
incident, though no charges have been issued or names released.
