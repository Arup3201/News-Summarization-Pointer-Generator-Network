AC/DC's guitarist Angus Young says he fell out of bed when he heard about drummer Phil Rudd being charged with allegedly hiring a hitman earlier this month.

Young and AC/DC singer Brian Johnson joked about Rudd's recent run-in with law in New Zealand with US radio host Howard Stern. 

'My wife woke me up and said "Phil's been up to no good",' Young told Howard Stern.

AC/DC bandmates Angus Young and Brian Johnson have joked about Phil Rudd's recent run-in with the law with US radio host Howard Stern

'Someone said "who was he trying to hit". It was his drug dealer.'

Johnson said he was getting ready to fly home to the States and had a cup of coffee in his hand when he saw the news on TV.

'There was this guy getting led out of a car with no shoes on looking like he was f***ing drugged and his head was on backwards,' Johnson said.

Young and Johnson were being interviewed about their latest album Rock And Bust when they spoke of Rudd. 

Police charged Rudd with allegedly hiring a hitman to kill two men in New Zealand in September. Those charges were later dropped.

Rudd, who has been with the band on and off for nearly three decades, was charged with threatening to kill and drug possessing in New Zealand earlier this month

The 60-year-old drummer still faces charges of threatening to kill and possessing methamphetamine and marijuana. He is expected to appear in court on November 27.  

Stern asked if Rudd was a still a member of AC/DC as a result of the charges.

'We've got to resolve that,' Young said.

Johnson suggested Rudd would not be back in the band. 

'I don't think we need to do any firing,' he said.

'The situation will take care of itself. He has gotten himself into a pickle. There is nothing we can do about it. We are talking about criminal charges here. We are talking about judges, we are talking about juries. We are going to go on tour. Nothing is going to stop us.'

But the pair made it clear that AC/DC would not break up because of Rudd.

'In the past we have had good drummers who have worked with us,' Young said.

AC/DC singer Brian Johnson and guitarist Angus Young gave an audience in New York a preview listening of Rock Or Bust on Tuesday, with Rudd noticeably absent from the appearance
