For any normal human 50 cents is worthless – for Tony Fernandes it was all he needed to buy his own airline.

When Fernandes bought AirAsia in 2001 from Malaysian conglomerate DRB-Hicom for a single Malaysian ringgit – worth about 50 cents at the time – the carrier was in free fall and plunging deeper into debt by the day.

But the flamboyant businessman built the small and failing company into a dominant player in south-east Asia with a low-cost model that focused on short and cheap flights. Some years later he started AirAsia X, which focused on long-haul flights.

AIrAsia CEO Tony Fernandes used a low-cost model that focused on short and cheap flights to make the airline a major player in south-east Asia

Mr Fernandes worked with fellow air tycoon Sir Richard Branson at Virgin Communications London in the late 1980s. They are now firm friends

His cavalier attitude in business and willingness to take a punt on an outside chance made his name. One of his most notable recently was when he bought Premier League football team Queens Park Rangers in 2011. He is currently their chairman and the team is sponsored by AirAsia. A minute's silence was observed at the start of Rangers' Premier League game against Crystal Palace on Sunday for those missing.

But the 50-year-old’s renowned self-belief will be severely tested after AirAsia flight QZ8501 between Surabaya, Indonesia and Singapore went missing with 137 adults, 17 children and one infant on board.

It’s a nightmare now, but he’d dreamed of operating his own budget airline since he was in school, he told the BBC in 2010. His motto, according to the AirAsia website, is: ‘Believe the unbelievable. Dream the impossible. Never take no for an answer.’

Fernandes’ career in business would seem to reflect this. He had a net worth of $US650 million ($A703.27 million) as of February, according to Forbes, which listed him as the 28th richest person in Malaysia.

The entrepreneur, who went to school at Epsom College in Surrey and later studied at the London School of Economics, made sure his first flight with the company – which had just two aircraft when he bought it – was one he was unable to take as a young boy.

Mr Fernandes' motto with AirAsia is: ‘Believe the unbelievable. Dream the impossible. Never take no for an answer.’

‘I always dreamt about doing a long-haul, low-cost airline,’ he said in a 2010 interview.

‘For my first ever flight in Air Asia X, I refused to do the launch to Australia and China and everyone thought it was a bit odd. But I wanted my first flight to be London-Kuala Lumpur.

‘It was very emotional for me 35 years on.’

The multi-millionaire's interests spread even further than the airline industry. As well as buying Queens Park Rangers in 2011, he also owned Formula One Team Caterham until this year.

He previously worked with fellow air tycoon Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Communications London in the late 1980s, before joining Warner Music International in 1989.

he adopted the Virgin airline owner's public, larger-than-life persona, and is now seen as the ‘Richard Branson of south-east Asia’.

The two are now close friendsn 2013, Branson dressed up as an AirAsiaX female flight attendant after losing a bet to Fernandes over a Formula 1 race.

He was awarded a CBE in 2011, and is an Officer of the Legion d'Honneur in France, the highest honour a non-national can receive.

Today though the devastated AirAsia CEO faces his biggest crisis and all he can do is hope.

'We are very devastated by what’s happened, it’s unbelievable,' he said in a media address in Surabaya on Monday.

'Our concern right now is for the relatives and for the next of kin – there is nothing more important to us, for our crew’s family, and for the passengers’ families.

‘We hope that the aircraft is found quickly, and we can find out the cause of what has happened.’
