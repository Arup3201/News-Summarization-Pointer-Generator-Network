It may have become Florida's latest tourist attraction.

But homeowners in Spring Hill are starting to fear their properties will be swallowed by the sinkhole, which has doubled in size since it was first spotted on Saturday.

Part of a street and driveway have already started to fall into the hole, but it is now encroaching on people's homes, and residents fear they may be forced to move out.

Concerns: Homeowners in Spring Hill, Florida, are sacred the sinkhole, which has doubled in size since Saturday, will swallow their homes 

Tourist attraction: Residents have joked about setting up lemonade and beer stalls to entice visitors who are beginning to show up

Just hours after the community spotted it several nearby homes were evacuated. But crowds have started to show up to peer into the hole.

Cate Carter, who lives nearby, has been able to see one funny side of the dire situation.

She told Fox 13: 'I thought about putting a lemonade stand out here, a beer stand, something out there, charging them.' 

But, pointing at the hole, she added: 'Looking at the road there, it looks like it came down there -- looks like a good six, seven inches.

'This is bad stuff. It could come this way. It could go that way. Who knows? It's very scary.'

According to the Hernando County Sheriff's Office, a resident reported it was 25 yards by 25 yards and 30 feet deep on Saturday. Hours later, it was 40 yards by 40 yards.

Now it is said to have doubled. 

One of the nearby homes has already been evacuated and others fear the may be forced to move.

A contractor has been called in to figure out exactly how big it is, and the threat it poses to surrounding homes. 

Visitors: Crowds have been visiting the hole since it was reported on Saturday. It had already grown by Sunday (pictured)

Massive:  Four households were forced to evacuate their homes Saturday as it grew rapidly before their eyes

Evacuation: Four homes were evacuated as the neighborhood uneasily went to bed for the night. By Sunday afternoon, just one of the homes remained evacuated
