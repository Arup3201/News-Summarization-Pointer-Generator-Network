Huge wigs, lashings of glitter and one very prominent beard, it can only mean one thing: London Pride is back with a vengeance.

And this year, the line-up is more dazzling than ever before, with Eurovsion winner Conchita Wurst, Sir Ian McKellen, 75, Sinitta, 50, and, of course, plenty of drag queens, all on the bill.

Thanks to Conchita's triumph, the success of Rupaul's Drag Race and the popularity of London Live's reality TV series, Drag Queens of London, the drag scene has enjoyed an upswing in interest in recent months.

Dusty named herself after Dusty Springfield, her childhood idol, which was also the nickname that her school bullies taunted her with

But of all the drag queens to feature in the London Live show, none is as popular The Very Miss Dusty O, who runs Trannyshack at Madame Jojo's in Soho and the host on the main stage of this year's Pride in Trafalgar Square tomorrow.

But while she's enjoying her new found popularity and soaring success, Miss Dusty says her career wasn't handed to her on a plate.

'I've been in the business professionally for about 25 years,' she explains.

'It started with me just dressing up for Night Clubs and then I started in the industry by standing on the door of clubs and ripping up tickets.'

She is now one of Soho's biggest names, and her reputation has seen her become a mentor to young aspiring drag queens - although Dusty herself says she still can't understand the hype.

'I can't deny that I am [a mentor] but 
I'm not very comfortable with that,' she confesses.

'I think it's because I'm highly 
visible, London has a very small drag scene - everyone always thinks it's
 bigger than it is - and I have been in it a long time so people do look 
to me for advice.

'People think I am more high-profile and more 
successful than I actually am - and certainly more than what my 
bank balance is telling me!'

Dusty helps to judge Trannyshack Academy at Madame Jojo's, a drag competition that helps uncover new talent.

But not every drag queen is created equal. According to Miss Dusty, drag comes in many forms and reveals that the only way to make it is by putting the effort in.

'I always say have 
fun, be who you want to be, learn from your mistakes and dress up up up! If you're a professional, you have to really hone your craft.

'People
 always ask me: "How do I become a great Queen?" and I always say: "Do it!" You 
have to just get out there.

'It's no good sitting at home in 
front of the mirror drawing an eyebrow on. It's like any other art - you 
have to practise it.'

Miss Dusty's image has certainly changed over the years, starting with a penchant for the New Romantics and her current incarnation: huge ball gowns and plenty of make-up.

A big character who is not afraid to ruffle the odd feather, Miss Dusty has had her fair share of showdowns, including one with fellow drag queen Bourgeoisie who claimed Dusty had humiliated her.

'I'm different from other drag queens in the way that I don't adopt a character,' adds Miss Dusty.

'Dusty is me, I spend a lot of my time in drag when I host, so I can't pretend to be someone else.

'The name Dusty came from my nickname as a child, everyone else liked Duran Duran and I liked Dusty Springfield.

'Dusty used to be my name of torture at school but now look where it's got me. All of those bullies are in council houses with five children and I'm not!'

Miss Dusty has more than 5,000 followers on Twitter and 750 Facebook fans - with social media, according to the veteran, why the drag scene is becoming more accepted.

'There was a real resurgence in the 90s, and I think we're starting to see one now too,' she adds. 'Social media means it's easy to access, everyone everywhere 
knows everyone else's business and videos are getting 100,000 hits on YouTube.'

But while the ensembles worn by Dusty and her fellow drag queens might look bizarre to the uninitiated, Dusty says it has been around for longer than you might think.

'There has always been an alternative drag scene,' she explains. 'It is becoming a bit more mainstream with Conchita winning Eurovision but there have always been people pushing boundaries.

'Pride is more relevant now than it ever
 has been. It reminds us of  how lucky we actually are especially when 
there are people being stoned to death for being gay.'

'There do tend to be fewer people strutting around in feather boas singing: "I am what I am", but the recent hype around drag is nothing we haven't seen before, it isn't revolutionary.'

Tomorrow, she will take part in Gay Pride  - an annual event that sees thousands of people descend on Trafalgar Square in London.

'Pride is more relevant now than it ever has been,' adds Miss Dusty. 'It reminds us of  how lucky we actually are especially when there are people being stoned to death for being gay.

'When people question why we still need Pride I always say: "It's one day a year!" We have heterosexuality shoved in our face everyday and this isn't harming anyone.

'At the end of the day it's a party and it puts a smile on people's faces.'
