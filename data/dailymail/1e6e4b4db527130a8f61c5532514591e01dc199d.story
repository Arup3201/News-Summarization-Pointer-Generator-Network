Prince Andrew is to be promoted to the naval rank of Vice Admiral just weeks after he became mired in a teenage sex slave scandal.

The Queen has approved the appointment, which is timed to mark her second son’s 55th birthday next week.

Buckingham Palace last night said the move was a ‘long-standing convention’ that enables Andrew, who served as a Sea King pilot with the Royal Navy in the Falklands War, to be promoted in line with peers still serving in the military.

Birthday present: The Duke of York has been promoted to vice-admiral by the Queen for his 55th birthday next week

Having fun: Andrew, pictured during a visit to Royal Naval Air Station Yeovilton, Somerset, last month, joined the Royal Navy at 18 and served in the Falklands 

Sources stressed that the move also recognised the ‘enormous amount of work that HRH does in support of the Royal Navy’.

The honorary appointment comes after a difficult few weeks for the Duke of York. Last month he was publicly accused by Virginia Roberts of knowingly having sex with her when she was just 17, which he has continued to deny vigorously.

In court papers US citizen Miss Roberts, now a married mother of three, claimed that she was forced to sleep with the prince on three occasions by his close friend, convicted paedophile Jeffery Epstein.

A photograph showing Andrew with his arm around Miss Roberts’ bare midriff when she visited London with Epstein was also submitted as part of the case.

Andrew has already admitted a grave error of judgment on his behalf on continuing his friendship with Epstein after he was released from prison for soliciting a minor. 

In 2011 he was forced to step down as special UK trade envoy after being photographed with the shamed billionaire financier the previous year.

Denial: Prince Andrew spoke for the first time last month to deny the sex accusations at the World Economic Forum in Davos

Buckingham Palace has vehemently denied the latest claims on the prince’s behalf, saying they are ‘categorically untrue’ and lack ‘any foundation’.

And in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos earlier this month, Andrew, who continues to undertake royal duties funded by the Queen, stressed his innocence.

The Queen has privately made clear she wants to stand by her second son and earlier this week allowed him to publish a photograph of her in her private apartment.

The image, posted on the prince’s public Facebook account, was seen by some as a clear sign of her support.

Now she has rubber-stamped his honorary promotion with the Royal Navy. In 2009 it was agreed that Andrew – who formally left the service in 2001 after 22 years – would enjoy ‘age-related’ promotions on par with colleagues who had remained in the service.

Under the agreement, the prince was promoted to Rear Admiral when he turned 50 in 2009 and will become Vice Admiral on his 55th birthday on Thursday next week. 

He is due to become Admiral at 60 but any honorary rank after that would be at the behest of the Queen. The latest appointment was announced in the London Gazette.

A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ‘This was approved by the Queen in line with long-standing convention covering military promotions for members of the Royal Family.’

A Royal Navy spokesman added: ‘Following his active service, His Royal Highness has been hugely supportive of the Royal Navy and has undertaken a vast amount of work for the service over many years.’ 

A source added: ‘The Duke of York does a huge amount of work for the Royal Navy and in order for him to remain in step in terms of rank with his contemporaries... the Royal Navy established a policy in 2009 by which he is promoted in line with his peers.’
