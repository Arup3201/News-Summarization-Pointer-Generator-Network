A schoolboy with a rare condition could be killed just by eating toast for breakfast or snacking on a packet of crisps.

Josh Guild suffers Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) - a painful genetic condition which means eating hard foods can be extremely painful.

The condition means the 11-year-old's mouth, throat and oesophagus are very tender, which can cause him to choke.

As a result Josh has to avoid hard foods, including crisps, toast and meat, living on a diet of chips, with the hard edges peeled off, as well as cakes and sweet treats.

Josh Guild, 11, suffers the rare condition Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB), a painful genetic condition which causes blisters to form on his skin and in his throat, mouth and oesophagus. It means he cannot eat a number of hard foods, including crisps and toast. He has created his own cook book, Josh's Easy Bites, for other children battling the incurable condition

To help other youngsters battling the condition, Josh, from Polesworth in Warwickshire, has compiled a cook book - Josh's Easy Bites.

It is full of recipe ideas using soft foods, which protect his oesophagus.

Josh said: 'I can’t eat the same food as my friends - stuff like crisps and sandwiches with crusts on - as it’s really painful.

'But the book is full of fun meals that I can make and eat - lots of sponge cakes and sweets - it’s brilliant.

'My favourite is the airplane cake which is covered in lovely soft icing so it stays moist.'

Josh’s Easy Bites is full of recipes for mint crème sweets, sausage plaits and even soft versions of shortbread to avoid the points.

It has been in the pipeline for two years and has been a family effort, with Josh's mother Toni, 37, father Simon, 42, and grandmother Val helping.

His parents, who are both nurses, start work at 6am every day so Josh's grandmother gets him ready for school, making him breakfast.

She said: 'Josh doesn’t eat the same food as us, which makes meal times extremely difficult.

'He can’t eat crisps, toast or even jam with seeds in as they’re too rough and pointy for him to eat without him being in agony.

'He
 loves chips, but we have to cut off the pointy bits and basically leave
 the soft potato inside and he loves sponge cakes and ready-to-roll 
icing.

Josh compiled the recipes with the help of his parents Toni and Simon and his grandmother Val, pictured with the 11-year-old. They include tasty ideas for a Sausage Plait and Peppermint Creams

Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) is a group of genetic disorders that cause the skin to become very fragile.

In some cases, as with Josh Guild, other internal membranes and organs are also affected.

Blisters, open wounds and sores form as a result of the slightest touch, rub or trauma.

Excessive blistering can create scar tissue which can cause fingers and toes to fuse together.

In extreme cases it can lead to skin cancer.

While some cases of EB can be fatal in infancy, others are severely life-limiting.

The charity DEBRA estimates there are more than 5,000 people in the UK with the condition and more than 500,000 sufferers across the world.

There is currently no known cure for EB.DEBRA will help launch Josh's book when he appears on TV later this month.

'The recipe book has been brilliant as he can learn what’s safe for him to eat and he gets to be involved in the cooking - when it isn’t too painful.

'After 11 years of being worried that what he will eat can make him choke, it has left him very nervous, so it’s good to educate him.'

To ensure Josh gets all the nutrients he needs, he is fed through a tube direct to his stomach overnight.

As with other types of EB, the slightest bit of friction on Josh’s hands or arms can cause the blisters or his skin to peel off.

The blisters often have to be drained - a painful procedure which can take several hours - so good nutrition is vital for the schoolboy to get vital nutrients to aid his constant healing.

Val said: 'Just standing and walking a few steps can be agony for Josh, but he copes really well.

'He’s been born with it so we’ve learnt how to deal with it by changing dressings constantly.'

Mrs Guild, said: 'We try to tell him he must live his life with EB - not let EB live his life.

'It’s easy for us to say, but he really does.

'He gets frustrated at times, but he has a remarkable outlook on life.'
