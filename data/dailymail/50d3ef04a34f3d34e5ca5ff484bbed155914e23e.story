The tycoon at the heart of a faulty breast implant scandal involving thousands of British woman is preparing to re-launch his bankrupt company, it was claimed today.

Jean-Claude Mas, 72, is facing a variety of charges including manslaughter following the collapse of Poly Implant Prothese, which went into liquidation last year.

But now the self-styled ‘creative genius’ is ready to start the business up again under a new name so that it can provide up to 60,000 implants a year.

Astonishingly, the firm boasts about having a start-up fund worth as much as £6million - a figure which will be of huge interest to some 250 women in the UK who have launched civil proceedings over their allegedly faulty PIP implants.

The French firm sold implants full of
 industrial silicone which ended up in some 400,000 women around the 
world, including around 40,000 in Britain.

Many of the discount products have since split open, while others have been linked with a variety of illnesses.

Brazilian health officials today said they are permanently banning the sale of the faulty French-made PIP breast implants.

The Health Ministry's National Agency for Sanitary Vigilance said its decision is based on tests conducted in France showing that women who got the implants could experience harmful leaks of cheap, industrial-grade silicone, not the medical-grade gel that higher-quality implants use.

An agency statement says that sales of implants made by the now-defunct company Poly Implant Prothese have been banned in Brazil since April 2010. The latest decision makes that ban permanent.

Brazil imported 34,631 of the implants and 24,534 were sold. The remaining implants will be destroyed.

Now Nice Matin, the regional newspaper covering Mas’s home in Seyne-sur-Mer, the town near Toulon where he launched PIP in 1991, has uncovered documents proving Mas wants to relaunch it under a new name.

Called ‘France Implant Technology’, the new company was created on June 15, 2011 under the names of his two children, Nicolas Lucciardi, 27, and Peggy Lucciardi, 24.

It will relaunch at the £5million 
factory once used by PIP in Seyne-su-Mere, and – according to the new 
business plan – will ‘sell in the very short term more than 60,000 
implants a year’, using a cash fund of more than 6 million euros.

‘The team is largely in place,’ says the plan, referring to some 120 PIP staff who were made redundant last year.

Mas is referred to twice in the plan –
 dated September 29, 2011 – as a ‘creative genius with 30 years of 
experience in breast implants’, and will officially be a ‘consultant’ to
 FIT.

The tycoon made 
millions from PIP, while the factory site is now officially owned by a 
company run by Dominique Lucciardi, the 66-year-old mother of his two 
children.

Health scare: One of PIP's breast implants, that contain industrial-grade silicon

‘It’s very clear that Mas wants to go back into the implant business under the guise of his close family,’ said a judicial source close to the case.

‘This will cause shock and alarm among all of his thousands of alleged victims.’

Mas currently claims to be bed-ridden following cardio-vascular surgery, but his son, Nicolas, said plans for the new company ‘have completely fallen apart’ because of the ‘media hype’ around PIP.

As well as facing trial in France in late 2012, Mas is wanted for a serious drink-driving offence in Costa Rica, which could see him jailed for up to three years.

Mas, who started his working life in his mother’s butcher’s shop, is thought to have saved up to £1million a year by using industrial silicon in the implants.

He has admitted through his lawyer that the industrial-grade silicone implants, which could cause health problems if they burst or leak, ‘did not formally receive approval’ and regulations were violated.

While France is to pay up to £60million for women to have their faulty PIP implants removed, the British government is currently taking no action beyond advising concerned women to consult their surgeons.
