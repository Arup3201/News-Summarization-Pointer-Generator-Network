Cherry blossoms in Washington, D.C. hit peak bloom on Thursday - serving as a clear sign of spring after a dreary winter.

The flowers were photographed in peak bloom near monuments in the city's Tidal Basin, including both the Thomas Jefferson Memorial and the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial.

The National Park Service said that the flowers reached peak bloom on Thursday, according to the Associated Press. Peak bloom, the wire service says, is when 'at least 70 percent of the trees around the Tidal Basin are blossoming with pink and white flowers.' It adds that the timing coincided with the National Cherry Blossom Festival.

The festival, held every spring, is used as a reminder of when 3,000 cherry trees were given to the United States by Japan in 1912 as a gesture of friendship, according to its website.

Washington, D.C. was extremely crowded over the weekend, WJLA notes, going by the number of rides taken through the city's Capital Bikeshare program.  The channel says 11,551 rides were taken on Friday and 15, 746 riders were taken on Saturday, when the Cherry Blossom Parade took place. 

On Sunday, D.C. resident Michelle Zador told WJLA she thought it was the most crowded she's seen the city in 25 years.

'The lines have been long, it's been frantic here, we had to walk about half a mile just to find a place to get water,' she said.
