A former U.S. Navy submarine warfare specialist has been sentenced to 30 years in prison for trying to sell state secrets to FBI agents posing as Russian spies.

Virginia Beach resident Robert Patrick Hoffman II, 40, faced the possibility of life in prison for trying to pass classified information to people he believed worked for the Russian government.

Hoffman was sentenced in federal court in Norfolk Monday by U.S. District Judge Robert Doumar.

Prosecutors said Hoffman gave sensitive documents about tracking ships to people he believed were Russian operatives, but in reality were FBI agents working undercover.

‘He was willing to place American lives at risk for personal gain,’ said Dana J. Boente, acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. ‘Today’s sentence should serve as a clear warning to others who would willingly compromise our nation’s most sensitive classified information.’

On his part, the 40-year-old man was unrepentant, claiming that he was the victim of a massive government conspiracy. He vowed to appeal his conviction.

‘I will not beg for mercy from this court and certainly not the FBI,’ said Hoffman, according to The Virginian Pilot. ‘I will not apologize for being good at my job.’

Hoffman was a cryptologic technician in the Navy who held top secret clearance and retired in November 2011. He spent much of his 20-year career as a submarine warfare specialist.

Originally from Buffalo, New York, the decorated veteran retired with the rank of petty officer first class.

Hoffman was convicted of attempted espionage this summer at the conclusion of a five-day trial. It took jurors only 90 minutes to find him guilty.

Evidence presented by the prosecution showed that the Virginia resident had access to classified information pertaining to national defense.

The FBI became suspicious of the veteran Navy serviceman after he made a three-week trip to Belarus shortly after he retired in November 2011 because he was passed over for a promotion, The Virginian Pilot reported.

The 40-year-old ladies’ man who drove a car with the license plate ‘GR8 LEI’ decided to travel to the former Soviet republic in order to seek out a group of Belorussian women he had met in a club while stationed in Bahrain.

During the trip, which Hoffman described to his friends back home as his 'man-cation,' he allegedly met with President Alexander Lukashenko.

Upon his return to the U.S., a female FBI employee answered Hoffman's Craigslist ad. Using the moniker 'Tracey Tea,' the undercover agent exchanged dozens of emails with the retired officer and even went on a few dates with him.

FBI later sent a second agent dubbed 'Olga' to his home dressed in a low-cut blouse and carrying a fake letter from Moscow containing a Soviet medal from a 'friend.' 

The missive supposedly written by a Russian spy named 'Vladimir' asked Hoffman to lend his ‘technical expertise.’

James Bond he's not: Hoffman agreed to drop off encrypted thumb drives in a hallow tree with classified information in exchange for a job that paid at least $45,000 a year and other perks 

In response, the unemployed serviceman replied that he was 'willing to develop a mutual trust' and looked forward to 'renewing [a] friendship' in exchange for a job that paid no less than $45,000 a year and other financial incentives.

Hoffman also emphasized that the need for 'security [was] paramount' and suggested they communicate by physical, rather than unsecure electronic means, according to the Justice Department.

Following an extensive email correspondence with an FBI operative posing as 'Vladimir,' Hoffman left encrypted thumb drives containing secret and top-secret national defense information at a drop site in the hollow of a tree in First Landing State Park in Virginia Beach on three separate occasions in the fall of 2012. 

He was finally arrested December 6, 2012, despite his protestations that he was acting to help the FBI ensnare Russian spies.

During the trial, the defense noted that he reached out to the FBI after dropping off the third and final thumb drive and handed agents copies of his email exchanges with Vladimir.

In one letter, Hoffman falsely claimed that he held the record for ‘most days deployed underwater.’

‘Literally, I have spent more time underwater than ANY human being EVER,’ he wrote.

In court, Hoffman described himself as a U.S. ’spy and a spy hunter’ who decided to assist the FBI out of kindness.
