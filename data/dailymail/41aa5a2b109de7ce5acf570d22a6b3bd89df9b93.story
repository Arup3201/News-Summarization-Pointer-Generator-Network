The number of children being bullied on the internet has doubled this year, with more than one in three now victims, research suggests.

In a poll of 11 to 17-year-olds, 35 per cent reported that they have experienced cyber-bullying - compared with 16 per cent last year.

Four in 10 said they had witnessed others being picked on online - almost double the 22 per cent recorded last year.

One in three young children have been bullied online over the past 12 months according to new research 

The study also suggests that thousands of teenagers, including many aged 15 or under, are using messaging service Snapchat and dating app Tinder every day.

Some parents even helped set their children up with accounts, prompting fears that they are unwittingly putting them at risk.

Internet security firm McAfee polled 2,000 UK children and 2,000 adults with at least one child aged under 18 ahead of the start of Anti-Bullying Week on Monday, and compared the findings with a similar study carried out last year.

The research indicated that there is a more relaxed attitude among increasing numbers of parents regarding the risks posed online.

Less than a third of parents said they were worried about their child being the victim of cyber-bullying this year - almost halving from 45 per cent in the previous year, while two-thirds of children are now allowed to go online without supervision - up from 53 per cent.

However, more than three-quarters of mothers and fathers polled said they had conversations about online safety, up from 68 per cent last year.

Andy Phippen, professor of social responsibility in IT at Plymouth University, said: 'The responses from McAfee's survey shows that there is a real gap between parental concern and the reality of what children face online.

'While it is encouraging to see that these conversations are happening, there are areas in which parents may not be completely aware of their children's online behaviour.

'It's now time for parents to take the conversations to the next level and become further educated on the social platforms that exist, what ages they are suited for and what type of behaviour they encourage.

'Cyber-bullying happens across all platforms and children's use of social media is transient.'

One in six youngsters admitted using  Tinder daily with the dating app more popular with girls than boys 

Around one in six of the youngsters polled reported using Tinder every day, with almost half of those aged 15 and under.

The service was more popular among girls than boys, with one in five female respondents using it compared with 15 per cent of males.

Tinder users are shown other subscribers close to their location and must give a positive reaction to them in the form of a tick, and receive one back in order to start communicating.

It is open to those who are 13 or older, with under-18s only able to match with people in the same age bracket.

Prof Phippen said: 'It is very concerning to see the proportion of younger teens using apps like Tinder, whose aim is essentially hook-ups and dating, and very much for an adult audience.

'These apps also share location-based information and can be used as platforms for grooming and abuse.'

More than a third of children polled reported spending up to 10 hours on Snapchat a day.

Reports recently emerged that explicit images taken with the app were intercepted by a third party app and leaked online.

Prof Phippen said: 'Social platforms like Snapchat are becoming more and more popular with kids and children may not realise the risks of exposure they face.'

One per cent of parents admitted helping set up Tinder profiles for their children, while nearly one in 10 gave them a hand joining Snapchat.

The research did not specify the ages of the children whose parents helped set up accounts, other than that they were under 18.

Samantha Humphries-Swift, of McAfee, said: 'As a mother myself, it is worrying to see that parents are setting up social profiles for their kids and, as a consequence, unknowingly putting them at risk online.'

Last week a report from the Health Select Committee said MPs heard evidence that sexting, cyber-bullying and inappropriate online content has caused a direct increase in mental health problems in children, including stress and anxiety.
