While most may see the local public pool as a respite from the summer heat, one in five sees it as a bathroom.

A shocking new survey claims that a full 20 per cent of those swimming and splashing about also relieve themselves in it.

Furthermore, red-eyes that often associated with a day at the pool are from chloramine, the chemical created when urine combines with the chlorine that's already in the pool, not from the water treatment chemical.

The survey was conducted by the Water 
Quality and Health Council, and reveals a number of statistics that may 
make pool-goers think twice before diving in.

While it did not exhaustively look into the reasons behind why people think they can urinate in a public pool, the survey suggests that it is easy and anonymous.

However, Dr Chris Wiant, who serves as chair of the Water Quality and Health Council said that is the wrong way to think.

‘No matter how easy it is to pee anonymously in the pool, swimmers should avoid doing so and take their children on frequent bathroom breaks,’ he said.

Dr Wiant also places responsibility on those working at the pool, adding: ‘Pool operators should also monitor and maintain proper pool water chemistry, especially pH and chlorine levels.’

According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, it is the ‘first defence against germs that can make swimmers sick.’

But the cringe-worthy results don’t stop
there – the survey reveals that nearly 70 per cent of people taking a 
dip do not shower beforehand.

The Council said that while it may seem 
counter-intuitive or redundant to rinse off before jumping in the pool, 
it is essential for the health of all of those around.

While this may seem harmless, people who
enter the pool without showering are essentially treating the pool as a
communal bath, the study says.

When things like makeup, 
sunscreen, bug spray, perfume, deodorant, sweat, and dirt that, mix with chlorine and other pool chemicals, they can cause significant irritation.

According to the CDC, many diseases spread through pool because people do not shower before jumping in, bringing dirt, sweat, and sunscreen into the water with them.

Everyone planning to take a plunge should first shower - a simple 15 to 30 second rinse is all it takes.

Those who are sick or have diarrhea should also avoid the pool to avoid transmitting diseases by the water.

Adults should use the restroom once every hour, and those with children should follow the same rules. Children's diapers should be checked every 30-60 minutes.

If a pool has a ripe or pungent smell, it should ostensibly be avoided, as chemically balanced pools emit no odour.

The report says that the famous ‘pool smell’ results not from the chlorine, but from the slurry of water impurities swimmers bring in by not showering reacting with the pool’s chemicals.

That is to say, the more strong-smelling a pool is, the more contaminated it is as well.

The Council notes that a well-maintained pool with the proper pH balance has no discernible odour.

Michele Hlavsa, the Chief of CDC’s Healthy Swimming Program told MailOnline that urine in the water creates two problems.

‘The first is that the urine eats up the chlorine to kill the germs,’ she said. ‘The other problem is that urine contains nitrogen – like personal care products – which create chloramine.’

Chloramine, a combination of chlorine and ammonia, is what causes itchy red eyes after a swim, not the chlorine that is used to treat the water.

She continued: ‘A healthy pool doesn’t smell – the smell is coming from the personal care products mixing with the chlorine.’

Ms Hlavsa, an RN with a Masters of Public Health, offered several tips for safe swimming. ‘It’s really important for swimmers to take bathroom breaks regularly once and hour,’ she said, adding that children’s diapers should be checked once every 30 to 60 minutes.

But the crux of the matter is simple. ‘It’s all about good hygiene,’ Ms Hlavsa said. ‘Even just rinsing in water for 15 or 30 seconds gets ride of the personal care products.’

In an effort to make the public aware of the importance of good poolside hygiene, the CDC expert said education is key.

‘Another step,’ she said, ‘is the Model Aquatic Health Mode. The CDC is developing this resource for state and local health departments of model standards,’ as there is no federal regulatory authority responsible for disinfected water parks and pools.

The MAHC includes rethinking the design of locker rooms and pool houses so that swimmers pass the showers before entering the pool, and making warm water readily available so there are no intended cold showers before a relaxing dip on a hot day.
