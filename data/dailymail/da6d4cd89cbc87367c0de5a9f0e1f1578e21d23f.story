Juan Cuadrado has admitted his delight at signing for Chelsea and is loving being 'surrounded by so many champions.' 

The Colombian completed his £27million move from Fiorentina during the January transfer window and is expected to add another attacking dimension to Jose Mourinho's side.

Talking to chelseafc.com, Cuadrado spoke about how pleased he is to be playing for the Premier League leaders.

He said: ‘I am very happy to be part of this team, I’m very grateful to have been given this possibility to live what has been a childhood dream for me, which is to play for a very big club – in fact, one of the best clubs in the world.

‘To be on the same team as all these big players is amazing for me, not only from a football point of view and how I can grow as a player, but also personally, to be surrounded by so many champions.'

The explosive winger also talked about the closeness of the Chelsea players and says he's fitting in well with the squad.

He revealed: ‘I’m now training and I was made to feel really welcome when I arrived.

'To me, that was very telling, because it’s clear we have a close-knit group and when that’s the case off the pitch, on the pitch that has to shine through.

‘In football you have to play for each other, and I can already see that’s what they do here. There is a real sense of togetherness and a big union within the team.’

Ahead of Saturday's game against Aston Villa, the 26-year-old is relishing playing under his new manager.  

‘Jose Mourinho has won everything and I think he is going to bring a lot to my game, but also I am going to look to learn a lot from him and grow by his side,' he added.

Cuadrado admits it was daunting arriving at the club but growing up watching some of Chelsea's current squad and having the chance to play with them now is a dream.

He said: ‘'I didn’t know any of the players personally before I joined, but obviously when I was younger I used to see some of them on television, players like Drogba and Terry.

‘To now be on the same team as them, and to train with them every day is such a dream come true. To think that when I was younger I really looked up to these champions, and now I’m playing with them.'

The ex-Fiorentina man already has silverware in his sight and he hopes to play a part in achieving those goals with the club.

‘Obviously one of my biggest aims is to help the team win the Premier League, that’s my principle goal,’ he says.

‘Also, I want us to really go for it in the Champions League, and on a personal level it would be great for me if I could contribute with some big goals for the team.’
