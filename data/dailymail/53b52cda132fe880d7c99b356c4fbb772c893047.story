TechCrunch blog founder Michael Arrington has denied claims he raped and physically abused an ex-girlfriend, insisting she made up the 'impossible' accusations because she was bitter he had taken up with a new lover.

Arrington, a Silicon Valley kingmaker, is demanding Jenn Allen unconditionally retract a series of 'false and defamatory' statements she made about him on Facebook in recent weeks and has threatened legal action if she doesn't oblige. He also said he has involved police.

Allen, herself a tech entrepreneur, claimed Arrington had physically and emotionally abused her during their eight year relationship, culminating in the alleged rape on March 5, 2012, and said he threatened to kill her if she told anyone. In a subsequent post on a news site, she claimed that Arrington had also sexually assaulted a friend.

Arrington hit back at the claims last week, calling them 'completely untrue' and said he had contacted police because of the 'gravity of the accusations.'

But yesterday he published a stern and lengthy letter from his attorney Eric George to Allen on his website uncrunched.com where the lawyer insisted his client couldn't have committed the alleged rape because 'On March 5, 2012, Michael was in Washington and you were in California.'

'Your twice-repeated allegation of rape/physical abuse by Michael is not only false, but factually impossible,' George wrote.

'Michael's whereabouts are confirmed by travel records and credit card statements in my possession, and your whereabouts are proven by a photo of you at a San Francisco party at 1:05 a.m. on March 6, 2012.'

The lawyer also accuses Allen of lying when she said she only contacted Arrington once after the alleged rape. Instead, he says she sent some 292 lines worth of data to him in the form of phone calls, texts and emails.

Soured: Jenn Allen says she dated Michael Arrington, deemed one of the most influential men in Silicon Valley, for eight years. She is accusing him of rape and physical abuse

Accusations: This is the post that started the allegations against Arrington. Three more abuse allegations have surfaced since then

She also sent him three sexually 
explicit photographs of herself the day after the alleged rape, one of which had the subject line 'For only you,' while another included a comment 'The other (pictures) are showing too much to email. Maybe if you beg. :).'

Other messages Arrington received from Allen included extensive landscaping advice and a request for him to invest in her art start-up. Then, on May 2, 2012, Allen asked Arrington to be her plus-one at a wedding two weeks later in Chicago.

'You stated that he engaged in 'physical abuse' and 'emotional abuse' of you, and 'threaten[ed] to murder you if you told anyone about the physical abuse,' George wrote in Thursday's letter.

'The foregoing statements of yours, as well as those set forth below, paint a starkly different picture; they do not portray you as a victim of abuse or murder threats, but rather as a person who is distraught at a break-up, and angered that her ex-boyfriend entered into a new relationship.'

The letter also refers to later communications including a April 21, 2012, message stating '(I) feel betrayed and slighted by you, and wish I wasn't alone since you decided to be with someone else so quickly. Not sure how I'm going to teach myself how to love and trust again.'

Proof: The lawyer claims a photo of Allen, pictured center, at a San Francisco party at 1:05 a.m. on March 6, 2012 shows she wasn't with Arrington on the day of the alleged rape

Contact: The lawyer also accuses Allen of lying when she said she only contacted Arrington once after the alleged rape

Emails: Instead, George says Allen sent some 292 lines worth of data to him in the form of phone calls, texts and emails, like that pictured

In August 2012, Allen allegedly tweeted:
'Mike @arrington last chance to reconcile. I[sic] you're not feeling 
what I’m feeling, with the same heart, than [sic] f*** you.'

The attorney also mentioned an incident on May 18, 2011, where George claims Allen emailed Arrington to tell him she was pregnant and that she planned to have an abortion the following day.

'You subsequently told Michael that you feigned the pregnancy and abortion in order to get him to communicate with you,' George wrote in the letter.

Allen came forward with public accusations of rape and physical abuse late last month on Facebook.

After her claims, news sites reported another allegation against Arrington - that he threw an ex-girlfriend against her bed in 1999.

Arrington, who has been named one of the
most powerful people in the Internet, denied the allegations on his website on April 7 and said that he had hired lawyers to represent him against the 'offending parties.'

Only for you: on March 6, 2012, Allen sent the picture, left, and in August 2012, Allen allegedly tweeted: 'Mike @arrington last chance to reconcile. I[sic] you're not feeling what I'm feeling, with the same heart, than [sic] f*** you'

The claims were never reported to police.
Friends and witnesses have come forward with contradicting stories 
about the incidents in question. One of the alleged victims also appears
to deny that Arrington abused her.

Other ex-girlfriends have said Arrington never abused them, reports TechCrunch, the blog Arrington founded in 2005. Arrington sold TechCruch to AOL in 2011 for $25million and is no longer is charge of editorial content.

The controversy began on March 29 when Allen posted to her 4,700 followers: 'I loved Michael Arrington for 8+ years starting when i implemented Eurekster search at the time on Techcrunch in 2006 and throughout the years.

'i(sic) didn't know he cheated on me multiple times, then tells people it was me immediately after he did it.

'It hurts when you love someone borderline and they can't feel anything at all for you, and threaten to murder you if you told anyone about the physical abuse - all for keeping his reputation. The emotional abuse was equally bad.'

Allen is the CEO of RTist.com, a website the connects artists with people buying art. In 2010, she accepted an award from GetBizSavvy.com for the 'Sexiest Female Entrepreneur.'

When the news site Gawker reported
on the allegations, a user later confirmed to be Allen commented: 
'His lies, abuse, threats and what he did to a friend of mine 5 months 
ago was unforgivable as well. He raped her, and she told me in person he
called her to confirm he did it after the fact.

'I'll leave it up to her if she ever wants to report it or say anything. This madness needs to stop, or he needs to start controlling his rage and rape "disorder."'

Allen's accusations led to reports of two other incidents with his ex-girlfriends that span nearly 15 years.

TechCrunch wrote: 'Rumors of similar alleged abuse have circulated in previous years amongst our peers. Many tech reporters have investigated them, but no stories had been published until those based on Allen’s posts this week.'

One new allegation surfaced in early April from the former human resources manger of RealNames, a start-up company where Arrington worked starting in 1997.

Cecile DeSmet Sharp told Gawker she handled a complaint from an employee who said Arrington has attacked her in her hotel room in 1999 while the two were traveling for a conference.

'I believe he threw her onto the bed. And she started kicking and he held her down really hard,' Sharp said.

Sharp said the incident was 'swept under the rug' by the company because Arrington was friends and business partners with the CEO.

'I was essentially told to look the other way,' Sharp said.

However, Keith Teire, who ran RealNames until it went under, told TechCrunch that he ordered a full investigation of the incident by an outside firm.

'As is normal in these circumstances an outside party was hired to conduct an investigation. This was extensive and I was never directly involved in it as I was not a witness to any events. The investigation concluded that there was no behavior to answer for. Mike was never reprimanded in any way,' he said.
