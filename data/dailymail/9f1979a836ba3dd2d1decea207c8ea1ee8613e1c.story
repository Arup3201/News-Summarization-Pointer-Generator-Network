When it comes to making public apologies, politicians have often been criticised for lacking sincerity.

But one politician in Japan has taken things to the other extreme after breaking down and wailing hysterically on live TV while apologising over claims he wasted public money.

Ryutaro Nonomura, 47, burst into tears and began banging on his desk and jabbering nonsensical phrases during a news conference on Tuesday.

A Japanese politician has broken down on live TV while apologising over claims he wasted public money

Ryutaro Nonomura, 47, was forced to apologise at a press conference following claims he used public money to travel to hot springs 106 times in one year

'To change Japan and society, I'm putting my life on the line,' the Hyogo Prefectural assemblyman said in a choked voice.

The conference followed a Kobe Shimbun newspaper report that raised questions about Mr Nonomura visiting the hot springs 106 times last year, using public money.

Such visits were not illegal and had been reported to the assembly office, but cost three million yen (£17,500).

Hyogo legislators get 500,000 yen (£3,000) a month for expenses, including travel, but the spending is supposed to be for official travel, research and other costs related to the activities of elected office.

The apology has caused controversy in conservative Japan where outbursts of emotion are frowned upon

Mr Nonomura, who does not belong to a major political party, was found to have gone to other day trips, racking up expenses, including visits to Tokyo and the south-western city of Fukuoka.

Of his 195 day trips, ones to the 'onsen' hot-springs resort town of Kinosaki, which lies outside his precinct, were the most frequent.

The video of his apology has since become an online hit, with nearly 2million views so far on YouTube.

However people in Japan have reacted with anger to the apology as public outbursts of emotion are generally frowned upon in the conservative country.

Shame: At another point during the broadcast, Nonomura took a deep breath before bowing his head

While the visits to the hot springs were not illegal, they did cost three million yen (£17,500)

Last month a Tokyo assemblyman was forced into a humiliating public apology after shouting a sexist remark at a female colleague.

Ayaka Shiomura was making a presentation on issues such as infertility and maternal support when hecklers called out 'You are the one who should get married first', 'She must be single' and 'Can't you even have babies?'.

Akihiro Suzuki, 51, admitted making the first comment and bowed to Shiomura at a press conference, though insisted he had not meant to offend her.
