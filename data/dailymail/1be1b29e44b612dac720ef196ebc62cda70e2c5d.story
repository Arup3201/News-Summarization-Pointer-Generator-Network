He might have reached the ripe old age of 133 - in canine terms - but this pooch proves it's never too late for an old dog to learn new tricks.

Blackie is well into his retirement - and should be taking things easy - but the energetic mongrel is often seen bounding around the kennels in south London which he currently calls home.

Staff there say Blackie is not yet too long in the tooth to be re-homed - and they are hopeful they can find him a new owner who will care for him in his twilight years.

Mongrel of maturity: Staff at Battersea Dogs and Cats Home believe Blackie could be the oldest pooch to walk through their gates since it was founded in 1860

At 19 canine years - the human 
equivalent of reaching 133 years - Blackie is by far the oldest resident
of Battersea Dog and Cats' Home in south London.

He is among a growing number of pets at the kennels who are living longer in their retirement years.

In fact, staff at Battersea believe Blackie could be the oldest dog to ever walk through its gates since it was founded in 1860.

The charity now hopes it can find an owner willing to give him a comfortable home for the remainder of his life.

Blackie
arrived in August as his owners could no longer care for him. However, 
he has impressed staff with his energy and his love of playing with 
toys, going for walks and lapping up attention.

Philip Heron, operations manager at 
Battersea, said: 'Blackie's owners assured us he is 19, and we can't 
find any record of an older dog ever arriving at Battersea.

Golden oldie: At the age of 19 - about 133 years in human terms - Blackie is among an increasing number of pets at the home who are living longer in their retirement years

'A 15, 16 or 17 year old dog isn't such a rare sight in our kennels, but a 19 year old is a real record-breaker for Battersea. Blackie still has lots of love to give, so we're searching for a special home for him.'

The number of older pets at Battersea has increased by two thirds in the last five years. In 2007 the charity looked after 264 dogs and cats aged 10 years or older, and based on current figures it expects to care for more than 430 this year.

The average age for a dog or cat depends on its breed, but this year Battersea has already cared for seven dogs and 18 cats aged 15 or older.

Mr Heron added: 'We believe dogs and cats are living longer than they might have done a decade ago. This is fantastic news for owners who can't imagine saying goodbye to their faithful friend, but we want to remind people they could be paying for vet and food bills until well into their pet's old age.'

He added: 'People are feeding their pets better diets which definitely helps. Going back 10 years, dogs used to arrive who ate their owner's leftover cereal for breakfast, whereas now they can enjoy tailored hypo-allergenic diets.

'Many owners are also finding it easier to get veterinary treatment, either thanks to subsidised vets or through pet insurance.'
