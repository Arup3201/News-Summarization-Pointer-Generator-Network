Marcus Wareing wants to try and boost his business by making the attitude of his waiters less pompous and more friendly and 'American'

A double Michelin star-winning celebrity chef has said that British restaurants should be 'more American' when it comes to their service.

After closing his eatery at the Berkeley hotel in Knightsbridge for refurbishment, TV chef Marcus Wareing said that he was going to be telling his waiters to be 'less French and more high-end American'.

Instead, he's focusing on giving his restaurant a friendlier 'dinner party atmosphere' in order to attract more customers.

He has said that when it re-opens it will focus more on friendly attitudes and less on long elaborate menus and wine lists.

Wareing said: 'I believe there has been a gradual, but genuine evolution in what the 
customer is looking for in today’s fine dining offering and we are now 
moving away from the more formal styles of service.'

In addition to a change in the style of service, the famous chef has also said that the starched linen used to cover the tables will also go 'on the bonfire', in favour of showing off the table legs.

Wareing told the Evening Standard: 'My number one priority is ending the stuffiness. People want to come to relax and not sit there while the waiter talks you through the 10 different ingredients in the dish.

'If someone comes in and says, "I want three courses and a glass of Chardonnay and I want it in half an hour", we’re not going to stick our noses in the air and say, "Humph why isn’t he having the tasting menu", we’re going to deliver it.

'I want people to have that feeling you get when you’ve been to a really good dinner party and you come away thinking, "Wow, that was an amazing evening". That’s what we want to reproduce.

The change in service is the brain-child of the restaurant manager Daniel Greenock.

Greenock recent spent over a year managing the New York restaurant Eleven Madison, and intends to bring what he's learned about service back to the UK.

A spokesperson for Marcus Waering said: 'The intention is not to make it into an American diner, its all about the service'

'We're stripping back the stiff and formal side and making it more engaging and friendly.'

Due to the recession and following economic slump, fewer people are eating out, choosing instead to dine at home or choose less expensive restaurants.

Wareing claimed that less people are ordering the more expensive tasting menus, and on average people are spending around 10 per cent less when they come to his restaurant.

While the restaurant has no plans to change into an American diner, the manager intends to strip back the service to a more simple and appealing style
