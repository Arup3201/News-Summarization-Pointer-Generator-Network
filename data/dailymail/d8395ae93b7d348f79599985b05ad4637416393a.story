The leak was spotted by Mark Gurman from 9to5mac.

Apple has since taken the images down from its website and is yet to comment after MailOnline contacted them.

The screenshot from the iOS 8.1 user guide for iBooks confirms the names of the two new devices - the iPad Air 2 and the iPad Mini 3.

Both devices now have a Touch ID sensor in their home button, which was first employed on Apple's iPhone 5S and now also features on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.

The images also reveal the iPad Mini will have an iSight camera.

And the iPad Air 2 has also been confirmed to have a Burst Mode like the iPhone 6, which lets the user take multiple photos but holding the picture button and then pick their favourite. 

The names of both devices have also been confirmed as the iPad Air 2 and the iPad Mini 3, with their appearances remaining almost unchanged from their predecessors.

This marks a shift back to the numbering scheme for iPads after the previous round of releases.

Today will also likely see the release of iOS 8.1, which will include Apple’s mobile payment service, Apple Pay.

It’s also rumoured that Apple will introduce a new iMac with a Retina display today alongside their new operating system - OS X Yosemite.

A more powerful processor and better camera optics can also be expected for both the iPad Air 2 and iPad Mini 3.

The Nexus 6 also has dual front-facing speakers designed to offer better quality audio, says Google.
