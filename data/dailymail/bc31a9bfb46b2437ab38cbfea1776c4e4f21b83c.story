A week dominated by headlines about the most famous Italian in the Weighing Room can end with a fellow Sardinian with his name in lights.

The tremors were almost off racing’s Richter Scale when Frankie Dettori lost the ride on Treve on Monday.

The 43-year-old, on board John Gosden’s Forever Now in this afternoon’s £650,000 Ladbrokes St Leger, will be an observer at Longchamp tomorrow when the filly tries to justify her place as Arc favourite against nine rivals in the Prix Vermeille.

By then Andrea Atzeni, 20 years Dettori’s junior, could be dreaming of the biggest race in Europe on October 5 should 3-1 favourite Kingston Hill do what he and trainer Roger Varian believe he can over the extended mile and three-quarters of the season’s final Classic.

That is how highly they regard their colt, winner of the Group One Racing Post Trophy at the course last year.

He has yet to win this season but produced solid efforts in both the 2,000 Guineas and Eclipse while his Derby second, when length and a quarter behind Australia, is form none of his rivals can touch.

This a group one performer up against fair rivals but ones who can’t boast a win above Group Three level between them.

With Varian giving Kingston Hill the green light to run after fears over the ground, there is an issue over whether Kingston Hill will stay.

His sire Mastercraftsman has yet to father a winner at today’s trip but his performance over a mile and a half in the Derby hardly suggests lack of staying power.

Atzeni, who needs two winners to ride 100 in a season for a first time, doesn’t think so.

He said: ‘In the Derby, the draw didn’t look good and I had to use the horse to get a position. He still galloped all the way to the line so has every chance of staying.

‘He has never been a flashy worker but his work last week was better than ever. He has never run a bad race and ran a blinder in the Derby probably against the best horse out there. To win my first Classic would be amazing.’

Atzeni, recently appointed Jamie Spencer’s 2015 successor as No 1 jockey to Qatar Racing, faces a strong challenge from Sir Michael Stoute’s Gordon Stakes winner and Great Voltigeur Stakes runner-up Snow Sky.

He will also respect team Gosden – the trainer has won the race four times - which also includes Derby third Romsdal and Marzocco.

If his temperament can be kept in check, James Given’s Odeon can out-run his long odds.

And Atzeni will not be taking anything for granted, the fate of Cotai Glory in yesterday’s Flying Childer’s Stakes underlined racing’s propensity for the unexpected.

The Charlie Hills-trained colt was cruising to victory when veering right and unseating jockey George Baker yards from the line handing victory Richard Hannon’s Beacon.

In contrast, the Queen’s Estimate was a thoroughly worthy length and a quarter winner of the Doncaster Cup under Ryan Moore, digging deep to pull clear of Whiplash Willie.

However, a tilt at the Melbourne Cup with Estimate is now looking unlikely.
