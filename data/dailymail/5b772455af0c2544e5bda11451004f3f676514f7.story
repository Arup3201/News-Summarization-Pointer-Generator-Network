Scrap-metal thieves are now targeting Britain's roads, plunging entire sections of motorways and dual carriageways into darkness because street lighting cables have been stolen.

Motorists'
lives are being put at serious risk as they are forced to negotiate highways without any lighting or - in some cases - crucial 
road signs.

The thieves have turned their attention to roads after 
plundering the country's rail network for copper cables which are highly 
valuable on world markets.

Crimewave: There are serious concerns that scrap-metal theft is putting drivers' lives at risk with sections of highways being plunged into darkness

Transport Minister Norman Baker told MPs the thefts were now affecting Britain's entire transport network.

He said: 'It's now a major problem and it's very serious for the rail industry, for passengers and for industry.

'This problem transcends the railway. 
It has affected motorways, the coastguard and the telecoms industry.

'The
level of theft tends to follow the price of copper and other metals on 
world markets.'

New legislation might be required to deal with the 'major problem' of cable theft on the railways, Mr Baker added.

The British Transport Police (BTP) 
now regards cable theft, which had resulted in severe delays to 
passenger services, as second only to terrorism in its list of 
priorities, he told the House of Commons Transport Committee.

Mr Baker said: 'BTP has indicated that it 
would be helpful to have new powers. There is a general concern, which I
am very happy to share, that the legislation in place isn't designed 
for the spate of thefts we are seeing.'

'Major concern': Transport Minister Norman Baker

Mr Baker said that no options had been ruled out, including a possible change to the 1964 Scrap Metal Dealers Act.

He said that the rail industry had 
initially taken the view that it was best not to publicise cable theft 
to try to avoid 'copy-cat activities'.

Earlier this week it was revealed how the crimewave had become so bad that undercover police units were travelling on railways in the dead of night to catch scrap-metal thieves red-handed.

The
locomotives – dubbed ghost trains – travel with their lights dimmed and
their engines muffled to allow specialist officers, equipped with 
infrared cameras, to catch unsuspecting criminals in the act.

The
tactic is aimed at countering the metal theft crimewave that has caused
chaos for rail passengers.

In the past seven months alone, 1,969 trains
have been cancelled because of 675 copper cable thefts across the 
network.

Last month a stretch of a dual carriageway more than a mile long in Leeds suffered a blackout after more than £200,000 of street lighting cable was stolen.

Police believe the thieves posed as workmen and engineers as they targeted the section of the A63 link road, leaving the half-mile sections of the highway in complete darkness.

Road safety experts also said vital road signs were vanishing from dangerous bends.

'You also have to take into account warning signs being stolen. If this happens on a bend, it can be really dangerous'

Andrew Howard, head of road safety at the AA

Andrew Howard, head of road safety at the AA, told the Telegraph: 'You also have to take into account warning signs being stolen.

'If this happens on a bend, it can be really dangerous. On a remote road in  North Yorkshire, for example, you would expect chevron signs and if that is not there it is much more worrying.'

Meanwhile Mr Baker told the committee that a newly-formed cross-ministerial group had already met twice to discuss the problem and has looked at what could be done to issue new guidance to the Environment Agency in terms of looking at scrapyards receiving rail cable.

Mr Baker added that Network Rail (NR) was looking to bury cables in particularly vulnerable areas and making sure that cables were properly marked so they could more easily identified if they turned up at scrapyards.

He also told MPs that it was hoped that NR could keep cable theft-caused disruption to train services to a minimum.

The committee's chairman Louise Ellman MP said that NR had said that cable theft had cost the railways £43 million over the last three years, plus costing the general economy about £16-20 million a year.
