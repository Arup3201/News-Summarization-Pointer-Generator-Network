A Connecticut dentist has been charged in the death of a patient who became unresponsive while having 20 teeth pulled and several implants installed last year.

Rashmi Patel, 45, of Suffield, turned himself in Tuesday at the Enfield Police Department and was charged with a misdemeanor count of criminally negligent homicide and a felony count of tampering with evidence, police said. 

Patel has offices in Enfield and Torrington.

The charges came exactly one year after Patel's patient, 64-year-old Judith Gan of Ellington, died in hospital on February 17, 2014.

Charged: Rashmi Patel, 45, turned himself in to police Tuesday night on a warrant for his arrest, one year after the death of his patient, Judith Gan, 64, who flat-lined in his dentist chair during a marathon operation

Going to trial: Dentist Rashmi Patel, center, sits at a hearing of the Connecticut State Dental Commission in Hartford on Wednesday, December 17, 2014. He has now been charged with criminally negligent homicide

State dental regulators concluded that Patel failed to adequately respond when Gan's oxygen levels dropped dangerously low when she was consciously sedated in the middle of the tooth extraction and implant procedures in Patel's Enfield office the same day.

Patel, who posted $25,000 bail, has denied any wrongdoing in his treatment of Gan. 

He and his attorney didn't return messages Wednesday.

Gan's death and other incidents prompted the State Dental Commission in December to suspend Patel's license pending a monthslong review of his practice and permanently ban him from performing conscious sedation.

The commission said in a report that Patel 'ignored' signs that Gan was in distress, including the drop in her oxygen saturation, changes in the color of her face and hands, and wheezing and gurgling sounds. 

Scene: Gan went into distress and later flat-lined during a complex procedure at Dr. Patel's Enfield Dental Surgery in Connecticut. She had a complex history of medical issues that Patel was aware of

The commission said Patel also ignored warnings from his dental assistants that Gan was in danger and continued on with the procedures.

The assistants told Patel to stop operating, but he pressed ahead.

When one of the assistants yelled that Gan was 'flat lining,' Patel tried to revive Gan while the assistant called 911, according to the Dental Commission's report.

Judith Gan, 64, died suddenly on February 17, 2014

Gan was rushed to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead.

The commission also found that Patel should not have attempted to perform so many procedures on Gan in one office visit, given that her extensive medical history.

Gan had suffered a heart attack six months before the visit, two strokes within the last two years, and the medication she was on could have affected her response to the sedation.

Patel was aware of Gan's medical issues. 

Patel also violated care standards in December 2013, when another patient under conscious sedation to have teeth extracted inhaled a piece of gauze called a throat pack, which was designed to protect him from swallowing foreign objects, the commission found. 

The patient began flailing, his blood pressure spiked and he was rushed to a hospital but recovered.

A lawyer for Gan's husband has said a lawsuit against Patel is planned.

Patel was also sued for malpractice in 2009 for 'shoddy' dental work, according to The New York Daily News.

The victim, Doreen Jasonis, won $500,000 from a jury before Patel appealed and settled out of court. 

Banned: Patel’s license, which was issued in 2003, was suspended in April. In December, the board banned him from treating patients under sedation
