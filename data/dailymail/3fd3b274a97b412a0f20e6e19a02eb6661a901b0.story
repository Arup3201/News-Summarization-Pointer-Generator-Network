Nick Clegg was accused of another U-turn after he said he had abandoned plans for his 'crude' mansion tax levied on £2million homes

Nick Clegg was accused of another U-turn yesterday after he said he had abandoned plans for his 'crude' mansion tax levied on £2million homes.

The Lib Dem leader said he was ditching the idea of charging a one per cent levy on the most expensive properties in favour of a 'mini-mansion tax' of adding higher council tax bands. The mansion tax had been enthusiastically backed by Business Secretary Vince Cable.

Mr Clegg said: 'I went off, big time, the idea that you have a fixed levy as a percentage over a certain value. The more I looked at it, the more I thought, 'That's very crude.' It leads to eye-watering amounts of tax being paid. 

'What we should do is go with the grain of the council tax system and apply bands to higher properties.'

Mr Clegg's remarks come after Ed Miliband caused a furore at his party conference last month by pledging to introduce a mansion tax on £2 million homes.

Labour is not planning to use the council tax system to apply the tax, leading critics to complain it would hit homeowners who had lived in their properties for a long time and were 'asset rich but cash poor'.

Earlier this year, Mr Cable was still arguing that a one per cent tax on property in excess of £2million was his preferred form of mansion tax.

But Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander has now lobbied Mr Clegg to introduce new bands starting at, for example, £2million, £4million and £10million.

It means the party could also ditch the term 'mansion tax' in favour of 'higher council tax' – although the extra money raised would be siphoned off by the Treasury rather than kept by local authorities.

Mr Alexander is due to set out more details over the new plan in his conference speech today.

His aides said the new approach was being favoured over the old system because it would be easier to implement.

One said: 'It would be simpler to put into action. With a crude mansion tax, you have to know the exact value of everyone's property over £2million. But if you're working with a series of price bands, you wouldn't need to do that.'

The Lib Dem leader said he was ditching the idea of charging a one per cent levy on the most expensive properties in favour of a 'mini-mansion tax' of adding higher council tax bands

The revenue from the new system – about £1.7billion – would be roughly the same.

Last night Tory MP Peter Bone accused the Lib Dems of a U-turn over the 'shambles' of their 'unfair and unworkable' mansion tax policy – just as Mr Clegg abandoned his pledge to scrap university tuition fees after the last Election.

Mr Bone said: 'The one thing voters need to know about is that the Lib Dems want to get more tax off people who have worked hard and bought their own homes. This is a home tax.'

He added he was surprised Mr Clegg's party had 'changed policy before an Election – they normally do it afterwards.'

The policy change may prompt fears among some Lib Dems that Mr Clegg is trying to water down his tax policy.

Last night, sources close to Mr Cable said he was 'not opposed' to the new council tax band version. But they added: 'The devil, of course, will be in the detail of what's proposed.'

A succession row broke out among Lib Dems last night as the party leader’s closest ally, Norman Lamb, hinted he’d like the top job. Health Minister Mr Lamb is loyal to Mr Clegg, whom he praises as ‘extraordinarily resilient’.

Senior party figures keen to stop Left-wing party president Tim Farron becoming leader have spoken of Mr Lamb as a favourite.

Asked if he would stand in a leadership contest, Mr Lamb said: ‘It is not something I am ruthlessly ambitious for, but I don’t rule it out...’

That is political-speak for ‘yes’.
