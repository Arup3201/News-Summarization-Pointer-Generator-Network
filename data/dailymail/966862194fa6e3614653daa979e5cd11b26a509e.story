Michelle Keegan has given FEMAIL a sneak peek of her upcoming SS15 range for Lipsy and she shows off her summer body and tan in the imagery, which was shot on a sun-drenched beach

The 27-year-old's new range is full of crochet, lace, slinky satins and lightweight knits, as well some 'fresh and exciting never-been-seen-before designs'.  

Actress Michelle, who is currently planning her wedding to Mark Wright, said of her upcoming range: 'One of my favourite parts of summer is being able to experiment with brand new styles and colours. 

'It’s the easiest season to wear fresh statement brights and hot new prints. I also love soft earthy shades such as nude and taupe complemented by sun kissed skin.'

Michelle has taken inspiration from the catwalk, and included lots of the monochrome pieces she loves to wear herself to create a range of swimwear, beach cover-ups and nighttime apparel.

'I would wear everything in the collection,' Michelle said. 'There's dresses for the evening, beachwear for days by the pool, playsuits and girly tops. There's lots of colour because I love embracing it for summer and there's fun touches like poms poms to give it a festival vibe.

'Overall, it's feminine, fun and classic.'

In between planning her wedding, filming and attending glitzy showbiz events, Michelle ensured that she spent plenty of time in the design studio to perfect each and every item from her new range.

'I've been really busy but I made sure to keep an eye on catwalk trends to see what's going to be big, created mood boards and analysed shapes, colours and textures to get it right,' she said.

Michelle advises fashion fans to keep it 'classic and simple' because she's all for 'timeless classic style a la Audrey Hepburn', right

Sharing her fail-safe tip for pulling off a look a la Michelle, she said: 'My top tip for day wear glamour is: keep it simple, keep it comfortable and wear key pieces. Whether it’s a statement jacket or a bag.' 

Her top three tips for evening glam? 'Choose what you reveal. Show cleavage or leg, never both of them together. I’m big up top so definitely more in favour of showing off my legs.

'Secondly, keep it classic and simple. I love a little black dress and I’m all for timeless classic style a la Audrey Hepburn. Dress for your shape, too. If you’ve got curves, accentuate them. If you’re tall, embrace it.

'Finally, invest in a really good body moisturiser. It really finishes off the look.' 

As for her beauty look, the radiant star takes a less is more approach to make-up.

'Keep a fresh-faced feel. With day wear make-up, you can always add to it later in the evening. In the summer, I wear much less make-up and it looks better on your skin.'

In summer, Michelle opts for a minimal beauty regime and says having a good moisturiser is an essential

Her beauty regime is fairly minimal and she simply cleanses, tones and moisturises every day and treats herself to a facial every other week to rehydrate her skin. She swears by Simple face wipes, Origins cleanser and Garnier and Kiehls moisturisers. 

The pint-sized star also emphasises the importance of exuding confidence. She said: 'If you’re feeling unsure about anything you’re wearing, ditch it. You’ll feel out of sorts all day if you don’t give your entire outfit a thumbs up.'

Bodywise, Michelle says she tries to work out as much as possible and whilst there's 'always an excuse not to go', she ends up feeling better after a workout.

'I try and go to the gym as much as I can,' she said. 'It could be three times a week or not at all one week, but I don't punish myself if I don't go.'

Michelle is looking forward to tying the knot to her Mark Wright, pictured together at The Sun Bizarre Party on Monday night, who previously revealed they are getting married in Norfolk later this year
