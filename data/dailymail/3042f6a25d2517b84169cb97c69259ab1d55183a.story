Roger Federer was paid a visit by some famous footballing faces as he trained in Dubai this week.

The Swiss tennis star was joined by former Arsenal legends Thierry Henry and Robert Pires, as well as ex-Barcelona defender Eric Abidal and ex-Chelsea man Nicolas Anelka.

World number two Federer begins his tennis season this Sunday at the Brisbane International in Australia, and was working hard at a training camp in preparation for the tournament.

Pires and Anelka, who are both still playing football in the Indian Premier League - for FC Goa and Mumbai City respectively - joined Federer et al on the court, where they posed for a photograph.

Henry and Abidal completed the line-up in the United Arab Emirates. Former Arsenal man Henry has recently signed a deal with Sky Sports to take over as a pundit, while Abidal appears to be enjoying retirement having hung up his boots in December. 

Following Federer's bow in Brisbane, he will participate in the main event - the Australian Open, which begins on January 19.
