Moving house is the perfect time to get rid of some unwanted clutter.

But this particular move is no ordinary downsize – and the local car boot sale might not make the grade.

Because the aristocratic Cunliffe-Copeland family, who have owned  Trelissick House in Cornwall for  generations, are expected to raise  more than £3million selling off their heirlooms at auction.

Sale: A few of the items being auctioned off from the Trelissick House stately home near Truro in Cornwall which are expected to raise more than three million pounds

The 18th-century property was left to the National Trust 58 years ago  provided that members of the family could carry on living in the manor.

But the current incumbent, William Copeland, has decided to buy a normal-sized home for his young family and will not have enough room for hundreds of the antiques.

He has decided to host a garden sale with a difference – a two-day auction of ornaments, paintings, furniture, jewellery, silverware, books, rugs and wine – which will be held in the grounds later this month.

The contents of Trelissick House in Cornwall could raise around £3m at the ultimate garden sale later this month

There is no reserve on many of the 
items, which means almost everything will be sold off, even if the bids 
fail to hit the expected price.

For years the Cunliffe-Copelands have filled Trelissick House with treasures picked up on their travels around the globe.

Leonard Cunliffe, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, began the collection in the late 19th century.

Mr Copeland said: ‘My 
great-grandfather had very fine tastes and collected many works of art 
from his travels in Europe and further afield.

This picture was painted by famous equine artist John Frederic Herring, a former groom to the Copeland family

Lots up for sale include the Qianlong vase, worth £100,000, left, and a pair of model lions worth £10,000, right

‘We have been guardians of these fine
works for a number of years and now that we are moving locally it is 
time to pass them on for others to enjoy.’

The most expensive item for sale is an 18th-century Chinese Imperial vase which is now worth £100,000.

A mahogany desk is valued at £30,000 while a pair of 18th century walnut side tables are also tipped to make £30,000.

Mr Copeland’s grandmother, Ida, was a Conservative MP and her George III mahogany writing desk is expected to bring in £15,000.

Stunning views: The house and grounds, which are owned by the National Trust, overlook the Fal estuary

An ornate Victorian silver candelabra
has an estimated price tag of £7,000 while a ten-piece silver dessert 
service from the same period is valued at £25,000.

And for any wine connoisseurs there 
are 11 bottles of 1990 Chateau Palmer red wine at £1,200, three bottles 
of a single malt whisky from 1935 for £1,200 and two bottles of a 1906 
St Lheurine Petite Champagne Cognac priced at an eye-watering £1,500.

Roger Tappin from auctioneers 
Bonhams, which is organising  the sale, said: ‘It is a stunning  
property with some wonderful items inside.

These intricately-decorated Spode beaded vases date back to 1817 and are said to be worth an estimated £4,000

Up for sale are portraits of William Taylor Copeland, left, and Evelyn Copeland dressed as a shepherdess

‘Although the National Trust own the house and estate, the Copeland family live in the house and own the contents.

‘William Copeland has decided that the time has come to downsize and own a more normal-sized family home in Cornwall.

‘Of course they can’t take the contents with them.

‘So they have now decided to sell it all and give other people the chance to buy a piece of their family history.’

Stacks of pictures and the Copeland family plaque are among lots up for sale on July 23 and 24 at Trelissick

Jenny and Willian Copeland are moving to a smaller house nearby - the last of five generations at Trelissick House

The heirlooms being sold have been collected by five generations of the Cunliffe-Copeland family at Trelissick

He added: ‘The items are typical of what you would expect to find in a historic country house.

‘People like to go to garden  sales 
and get a glimpse into  other people’s lives. To not only  get an 
insight into life inside a stately home like Trelissick  but also to 
have the chance to  buy something from it is quite something.’

Mr Tappin explained that English country house sales used to be a common occurrence in the 1950s and 60s, but are now very rare.

The entire contents of the house is for sale, from furniture and paintings to the contents of the (valuable) cellar

A vast array of Spode and Copeland ceramics will be auctioned in the two-day sale later this month

The dining table and chairs are up for sale with the rest of the dining room furniture at the Cornish mansion

This 1826 dinner service has an estimated value of £12,000 - just don't put it in the dishwasher

The elegant grey sitting room at Trelissick House has oil paintings and decorative plates that are for sale

‘You could have two or three of these sales a year per auction house back in the 1960s,’ he said.

‘After the war, a lot of these 
estates fell into disrepair and the owners didn’t have the funds to do 
the work. So they were sold off with everything in it.

‘Stately homes in private ownership like Trelissick are becoming scarcer and these sales now are as rare as hen’s teeth.’

The Cunliffe-Copeland family have lived at Trelissick since 1913

Leonard Daneham Cunliffe was deputy governor of the Bank of England, co-founder of the merchant bank Cunliffe Brothers and director of the Hudson Bay Company.

When he died in 1937, he bequeathed much of his antiques collection to the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge.

But he left his country house estate - Trelissick, in Cornwall - to his stepdaughter, Ida Copeland.

Ida was the daughter of Count Camillo Fenzi, a Tuscan senator, but her father died and her mother married Leonard Cunliffe and she moved to Cornwall.

Ida married Ronald Copeland, the president of Copeland and Spode, a successful ceramics company in Stoke-on-Trent.

In 1931, she stood successfully against Sir Oswald Mosley and became Conservative MP for Stoke.

In 1955, much of the estate was donated to the National Trust in 1955 by Mrs Copeland, William Copeland's grandmother.

This year, the last generation of the family will move out when William and Jennifer Copeland take their family to live in a smaller house nearby.
