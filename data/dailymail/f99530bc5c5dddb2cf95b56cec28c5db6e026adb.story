The parents of virgin killer Elliot Rodger are 'grieving for those innocents who lost their lives, above their own son', according to a close family friend.

Peter and Chin Rodger have been 'crippled by guilt' since their eldest child went on his bloody rampage on Friday – something they heard unfold on the radio as they raced up to Santa Barbara to be with the disturbed 22-year-old.

And while they are heartbroken over the loss of their son, they are currently more distraught about the deaths of his six innocent victims.

Close 
friend and author Simon Astaire has spent the last few days with Chin, 
Peter and his wife Soumaya and he says they are so upset they can 
'barely string a sentence together'.

Mr Astaire, who is acting as their spokesman, said: 'They are absolutely crippled by grief. I know them very well and it is incredibly hard to be in their company, because they are so distraught. It is hard to be near them because they are so devastated.

'I can tell you that they are grieving for those who've lost their lives before their own son. They really are, that's where they are. I can't imagine the confusion there must be in that?

'These are eloquent people and they can hardly get a sentence out. They are that mortified.'

Speaking about the family and his own interactions with Elliot, he said: 'I have been with them from the very start of all this. They are great people and close friends. 

'I always looked forward to coming to LA
 because there wasn’t a moment when they didn't want to entertain you. 
And they had a kid, a kid called Elliot.

'He was painfully shy, couldn't look at you straight in the eye and looked at your feet. It was unbearable. If you asked me last week I would have said he was one of the most reserved, self-contained guys you could ever meet.

'I remember a couple of Christmases ago I was having dinner with them. I went outside for a breather and there was Elliot, on his own and he was the loneliest figure I think I have ever seen.

'I remember thinking at the time, he was totally alone, a figure of solitude. I apologized and asked if I was interrupting and walked away. He was that kind of shy guy who you never talked to because he was so on his own you felt you were intruding even asking him a question.'

And he insisted his friends had done everything they possibly could to avert the massacre, even racing up to the campus to try to intervene after seeing his chilling YouTube video in which he reveals his bloody plans.

Mr Astaire said: 'He was in therapy from the age of nine and to the very last moment they were in a chase to save their son. They raced up to try to save him, it's everyone's nightmare. You're driving up to Santa Barbara and you hear a black BMW is involved.'

Since the shocking incident it has been revealed that police had contact with Rodger three times while he was living in Isla Vista, but they failed to see any warning signs.

On one occasion, a family member called and asked officers to check on Rodger because they were worried about his mental state.

In his warped 141-page manifesto, he describes the incident, saying: 'If they had demanded to search my room ... (t)hat would have ended everything. For a few horrible seconds, I thought it was all over.... [T]he police would have searched my room, found all of my guns and weapons, along with my writings about what I plan to do with them.

'I would have been thrown in jail, denied of the chance to exact revenge on my enemies. I can't imagine a hell darker than that.'

But Rodger’s parents don't blame the authorities at all. Mr Astaire said: 'They don't place any blame on the police, because Elliot fooled everyone, no one knew the man he was turning into.

'He seemed a sensitive guy, there was nothing aggressive about him, there was no anger. No one recognizes the person portrayed in the manifesto. He didn’t act in that way, he was just in his own world. He didn’t once speak about guns.

'If you look at the amount of therapists they took him to, it is clear he did all he could. He's writing with anger, but he constantly references how they tried to make him feel better.'
