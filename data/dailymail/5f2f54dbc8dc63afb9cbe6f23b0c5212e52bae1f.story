Clean up after yourselves, stay out of the road and stop talking about annoying 'hipster topics'; the neighbours can hear you.

A San Francisco coffee shop has laid out a set of rules for its diners that includes a ban on talking about ‘hipster’ things and who they had sex with last night, according to a local blogger's photo that captured it outside.

Ironically Four Barrel Coffee, which shows overturned buckets and crates for seating on weekends along its alleged problematic alleyway, is a hipster venue itself.

House rules: A posting of rules by a San Francisco coffee shop has asked their outside diners to clean up after themselves, lower their voices and not talk about annoying hipster topics

In contrast to their newly posted rules, their website sells their artisan atmosphere - featuring an assortment of coffees from Africa, Latin America and Indonesia among others - as a place you will likely hear 'a dramatic recounting of last night's scandalous activities.’

But they appear to have turned their ways, at least with the Caledonia alleyway’s neighbours in mind.

As the rules go: Keep the alley clear of trash, bring dishes back inside, watch out for traffic in the alley, monitor your voice levels and lastly:

'[Don't talk] about annoying hipster topics, or who you f***** last night. You shouldn't do that anyhow, but our neighbors actually can hear you.'

The alley: The rules were posted for diners along this alleyway whose chit-chat is said to be heard by the area's neighbours

The scene: The front of Four Barrel Coffee is seen with road bikes leaning out front and barristers inside offering an assortment of coffees from Africa, Latin America and Indonesia

Fancy that: Ironically Four Barrel Coffee describes itself as a place for people to go to hear conversations on what 'scandalous activities' one another got up to the night before

The post signs off: 'mucho smoocho.'

What could classify as 'hipster topics' by Four Barrel Coffee’s standards is not clear from the posting.

UpTownAlmanac suggests one topic being the customer having to tell the barista what kind of coffee they'd like.

MrEricSir, who posted the photo to his blog this week notes that while the last rule 'may sound somewhat sarcastic ... most people do not
live vicariously through overheard stories of love conquests occurring 
at Crystal Castles concerts. So perhaps there is a shred of truth to 
this.'
