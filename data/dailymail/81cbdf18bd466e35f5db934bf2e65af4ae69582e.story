The woman who needed 16 stitches in her head and face after being hit by a flying bottle during the alleged bar brawl between Chris Brown and Drake has spoken out about the ordeal.

Australian tourist Hollie C. was caught in the middle of the fracas at the Manhattan club early on Thursday morning, when the hip hop rivals allegedly butted heads over former flame Rihanna.

On a video, the 24-year-old said she returned home from a night in hospital to find out 'the reason I have 16 stitches in my head is because of some stupid famous people having a fight over a girl'.

Injuries: Hollie C, a 24-year-old tourist, received 16 stitches to her head after she was hit with a flying bottle during a fight reportedly between hip hop artists Chris Brown and Drake in Manhattan

Speaking out: Hollie has now blamed the injuries on the actions of 'stupid famous people'

She added on the footage seen by TMZ: 'Where's the justice in them driving away in a limo while I had to catch the train home on one of my holidays?'

Grisly pictures show a deep gash on Hollie's head and blood running down her face. She was one of five people - including Brown's bodyguard - hospitalised after the melee.

In an earlier interview, Hollie explained she was at the club with friends early on Thursday morning and was unaware of the fight escalating around her.

'Within a few moments of noticing glass being thrown around, I saw a glass bottle headed towards me, consequently hitting me in the head.' she told TMZ.

'I immediately started to bleed and proceeded to fall in and out of consciousness.'

She was then taken to Bellevue Hospital for stitches.

There have been conflicting accounts of 
what occurred at W.i.P in SoHo, when 
reportedly cutting words and gestures between Chris Brown and Drake allegedly 
spiraled out of control.

Witnesses
said the men, who have both been romantically linked to Rihanna, started fighting after Brown sent 
Drake a bottle of Champagne as a peace offering - which Drake snubbed.

He reportedly sent 
the bottle back with a note: 'I'm f****** the love of your life, deal with it.'

Enraged, Brown reportedly confronted Drake, who threw a punch at his rival, the Global Grind reported. Before Brown could react, one of Drake's group threw a bottle at him, hitting his chin.

Brown posted a picture on Twitter of his sliced chin, an injury over which he could press charges.

Within moments, the trouble reportedly escalated and bottles and punches were thrown.

Big Pat, Brown's bodyguard, was also 
hospitalised in the ruckus. A photo shows him laying in a hospital bed 
with a bloody, wound on his head.

A source told the New York Post:
 'They were on opposite sides of the room, Drake went over to the middle
 of the club to talk to someone, then words were exchanged with Chris 
and his entourage.

The source said someone from Drake's entourage, possibly the singer himself, threw a bottle.

'Once the bottle was thrown, all hell broke loose and there were more bottles thrown.'

The fight allegedly kicked off as the last song was playing, just before 4 a.m. Police were 
already at the scene as it was closing time and they 'were on 
it in seconds and began getting everyone out.'

Pictures of the aftermath show the club floor strewn with broken glass.

Brown
 was pulled out of the situation by his own security and helped out of 
the club while Drake was pulled to the back of the club, the source 
said. '[Drake] was one of the last out of W.I.P.'

The account comes despite Drake's claims that he was not involved in a fight. His
 spokeswoman said in a statement: 'He was on his way out of the club 
when the altercation began.'

On Thursday night, Brown's lawyer reportedly gave detectives 'physical evidence' proving that Drake was involved in the 
bar brawl.

Lawyer Mark Geragos went to the NYPD on Thursday night to present evidence showing Drake was an aggressors, along with rapper Meek Mill, law enforcement sources told TMZ.

It
 added that Brown is being treated as a 'witness and victim' rather than
 a suspect. He spoke to officers on Thursday night about the incident, 
according to TMZ.

Drake
 is not being treated as a suspect either and has been co-operating with
 authorities, but it is not known if he has spoken to officers.

The New York Police Department is investigating the fight. A spokesman said investigators believe Brown, his bodyguard and a woman were trying to leave when they were confronted by five members of Drake's posse.

As they were squaring off, someone 
threw a bottle. Drake, whose real name is Aubrey Drake Graham, was not 
in the group that confronted Chris Brown, NYPD Lt John Grimple told 
MailOnline.

Police
are looking at surveillance footage and talking to patrons who 
witnessed the fight. No arrests have been made and no complaints have been filed.

Tug of love: Rihanna, pictured in New York on Thursday, was reportedly the subject of the fight

Just a day after the brawl, the bar's
 owner Jonathan Cantor was arrested after out-of-control music at his 
other venue, Greenhouse in SoHo, the New York Post reported.

Chris Brown and Toronto rapper Drake have had a war of words since both being romantically attached to Rihanna.

Recent
 rumours have suggested Brown and Rihanna could rekindle their romance, 
despite their high profile break up after Brown savagely beat her ahead 
of her Grammy Awards performance in 2009.

The lovelorn pair have been linked 
together several times already this year, after it emerged that they had
 recorded songs with each other.
