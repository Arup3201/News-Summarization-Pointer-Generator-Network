Serena Williams spent Sunday evening out on the town with Caroline Wozniacki, despite having just beaten her in the final of the US Open to win an 18th grand slam.

The pair posted darkened pictures, from what appears to be inside a New York nightclub, alongside model Gigi Hadid and Joe Jonas of the Jonas Brothers on their  Instagram accounts.

Williams and Wozniacki have one of the closest relationships on the women's tour and are no strangers to spending time with each other outside of their ultra-competitive environment.

Just the two of us: Williams and Wozniacki have one of the closest friendships on the women's tour

 

The two were pictured at a basketball game earlier in the week and previously catching some rays on a Miami beach where Williams comforted the Dane following her high-profile split with golf's world No 1 Rory McIlroy.

Despite obviously caring for her friend, Williams showed no mercy to her on court as she swept to a 6-3, 6-3 victory at Flushing Meadows to clinch a third successive US Open title.

Although Wozniacki was formerly ranked world No 1 she is yet to win a grand slam title, having also reached the US Open final in 2009.
