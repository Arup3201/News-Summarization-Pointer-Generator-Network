The gym where George Zimmerman trained before allegedly murdering black teenager Trayvon Martin has been accused of trying to cash in by offering to supply information on the killer's training routine.

Zimmerman is accused of murdering the unarmed black teenager after following him with a gun and provoking him into a fight.

Kokopelli's Gym in Longwood, Florida, have posted an online request form on their website offering to supply information about Zimmerman's Mixed Martial Arts training program after the trial.

Publicity stunt? The request form for information on George Zimmerman's training program posted on the Kokopelli's Gym website

But since the form was put up the gym has received a flurry of negative messages on its Yelp social media page, with the owner Adam Pollock of being accused of racism.

One user Michael L wrote: 'This place is a dump . Owned by a big racist. Don't go here.'

Another post read: 'Bunch of losers crooks and downright horrible people capitalising off the death of a young man.'

Mr Pollock had earlier testified to the trial how Zimmerman was an utter novice at martial arts and described him as being 'grossly obese'.

He said that in terms of physical ability, he would rate Zimmerman as 1 out of 10 and no higher than a 1.5 out of 10 as a wrestler, suggesting the form may have been intended for media requests.

The trial has heard from a witness who claimed the 17-year-old had overpowered Zimmerman during their struggle and had pinned him to the ground moments before he was shot.

The witness said: 'Where I first walked out there, the black guy was on top and the only reason I can tell that was because the guy that was on the ground under him at that point wrestling was definitely a lighter color.'

Zimmerman, who has been described as a 'wannabe cop' had reportedly been training intensely in Mixed Martial Arts three days before the shooting.

In his closing arguments, Florida state prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda told the jury: 'A teenager is dead.

'He is dead through no fault of his own. He is dead because another man made assumptions. Because his assumptions were wrong, Trayvon Benjamin Martin will no longer walk on this Earth.'

Mr de la Rionda portrayed Zimmerman as a predator, not the good citizen who, as portrayed by the defense, was attacked by a 17-year-old whose actions led to his own death.

Defense lawyers are due to present their 
closing arguments today, followed by a final prosecution rebuttal, after
which the jury would begin deliberating a case that has captivated and 
polarized much of the U.S. public.

Time and again, de la Rionda accused Zimmerman of lying about what happened the rainy night of Feb. 26, 2012, when he spotted Martin inside a gated community in the central Florida town of Sanford.

Zimmerman called police, saying he believed Martin was suspicious and noted that there had been break-ins in the neighborhood.

But Martin was a guest in the home of his father's fiance, who lived inside the gated community, and was returning from a nearby convenience store with a snack in preparation for watching the NBA All-Star game.

Mr de la Rionda tried to undermine Zimmerman's claim that he was not following Martin but looking for a street address to relay to police. The prosecutor sought to reveal inconsistencies in Zimmerman's statements and repeatedly quoted him speaking in police jargon.

Pointing at Zimmerman, who was seated at the defense table, de la Rionda asked the jury to use common sense to answer the question: 'Do you believe there's an innocent man sitting over there?'

'Who started this?' he asked. 'Who followed who? Who was minding his own business? And of the two, who was armed?'

Mr de la Rionda avoided mentioning race but said Zimmerman 'profiled' Martin, suggesting he assumed Martin was a criminal because he was black.

If convicted, Zimmerman could be sentenced to life in prison for second-degree murder and up to 30 years for manslaughter.
