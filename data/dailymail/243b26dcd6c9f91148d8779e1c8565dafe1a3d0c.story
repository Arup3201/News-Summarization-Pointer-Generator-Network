China may have just issued a ban on new government buildings but that hasn't stopped officials in one small village putting the finishing touches to a sprawling seven-storey office complex for just eight workers.

The ostentatious building in the village of Yungai, on the outskirts of the city of Changsha in the central province of Hunan, cost over 15 million yuan (£1.5 million) to complete.

It boasts an impressive portico entrance, an auditorium, thousands of square feet of office space and its many meeting rooms are kitted out with plush leather sofas.

However only the first of its seven floors is currently occupied by just five government officials, two secretaries and university graduate who helps out.

Yungai village has a population of around 3,700, most of whom are peasant rice-growers earning around £900 a year.

Local communist party secretary, Tan Junwu, argues the offices are part of a plan to transform Yungai into a modern and forward-thinking community and would attract business and investment.

The Chinese business magazine Caijing, reported: 'To build this office, the village owes more than ten million yuan to the construction company,'

Three months ago China's communist 
leadership issued a five-year ban on any new government buildings in a 
bid to crack down on corruption and wasteful spending.

According to the state-owned news agency said Xinhua, there would be an 'across-the-board halt to the construction of new government buildings, training centres or hotels.'

Recent years have seen local government officials vying to out do each other by building larger and larger offices.  

In the eastern city of Fuyang, officials blew 30 million yuan (£3 million) on a replica of the White House in Washington DC.

And a state-owned drugs company provoked outrage building a new headquarters decorated to look France's Versailles palace, complete with gilted walls and chandeliers.

The local authorities stand accused of constructing the huge buildings in an attempt to artificially ramp up land prices.
