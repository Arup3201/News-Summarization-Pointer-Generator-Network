Instagram led the way when it added filters to its photo-sharing tool back in 2010, and now they are ubiquitous across social networks and other editing apps.

Taking advantage of this popularity, Instagram has today released five new additions to its filter range - for the first time since December 2012.

The new filters are called Slumber, Crema, Ludwig, Perpetua and Aden, and take the total number of options up to 25.

The five new filters are called Slumber, (pictured left) Crema, (centre) Ludwig, Perpetua and Aden (right). They are the first additions since Mayfair and Willow in December 2012 and take to total number of options to 25

These filters are the first to be added to the app since Mayfair and Willow launched in December 2012. 

'Since Instagram launched four years ago, our phone cameras have vastly improved,' explained the Facebook-owned firm. 

'The original Instagram filters compensated for lower image quality, giving you more control over the look and feel of a photo.

'These new filters are more subtle - taking advantage of higher image quality, while still giving you a simple way to capture the mood, tone and feelings of the moment.'

Along with the five new filters, Instagram has also announced three new tools. 

From today, users can now upload slow-motion video, see comments appear in real time - without having to refresh the feed - and adjust the photo's perspective using the Adjust tool.
