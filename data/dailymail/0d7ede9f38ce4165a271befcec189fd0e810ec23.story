This is the moment a bearded dragon lizard was given oxygen by paramedics after it was rescued from a house fire.

Crews were called to a terraced house in Bolton, Greater Manchester, just before 11am this morning when a fire began behind the fridge-freezer.

When firefighters arrived they found a woman outside with her two husky dogs, who told them her pet lizard was still inside as smoke poured from the kitchen.

They found the bearded dragon in its tank and took it out to the fire engine where medics treated it with oxygen therapy.

Watch Manager Tony McKenna, from Bolton Central, said: 'Crews wearing breathing apparatus used a hose reel to put out the fire in the kitchen - which we believe started behind the fridge-freezer due to an electrical fault.

'The fire caused a lot of damage to the kitchen and we want to remind people about keeping an eye on and maintaining electrical items and plugs.'

Chair of Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Authority, Councillor David Acton, said: 'Please can we remind people about taking extra care when it comes to their electrical items and not leaving them plugged in too long and making sure that wires, plugs and chargers and in good working order.'
