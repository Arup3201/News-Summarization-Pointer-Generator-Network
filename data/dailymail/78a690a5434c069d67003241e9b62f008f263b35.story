On September 13 Gabriel Agbonlahor bundled the ball past Simon Mignolet at Anfield to send Aston Villa second in the Barclays Premier League and maintain their unbeaten start to the season. Four days later Villa boss Paul Lambert was rewarded with a contract extension until 2018.

Villa fans haven’t seen the net ripple since – at the right end anyway.

Forty seven days, 531 minutes of football and five defeats have passed since, with 13 goals flying past Brad Guzan in the Villa goal.

They have plummeted from second in the league to 15th and their last two blanks came against QPR, who have conceded the most goals this season (18), and Everton, who have shipped 17.

Tottenham’s visit to Villa Park on Sunday gives Lambert’s side a chance to end their scoreless streak, and avoid becoming one of the top 10 longest Premier League team goal droughts.

If they fail to score in the first 34 minutes they will knock Burnley out of the top 10, and establish the longest goal drought since 2008.

Villa's last goal came in a win to remember, beating Liverpool 1-0 at Anfield on September 13

Should they go the whole game without a goal Villa will move joint-fifth with Sheffield United, who went 621 minutes without a goal in 1994. 

Their efforts in front of goal in recent weeks have not been helped by Christian Benteke’s struggles to rediscover form since returning from a seven-month lay-off after damaging his achilles in April.

The Belgian international tormented defences last season for Villa but has looked a shadow of that player against Everton and QPR.

Arsenal (H) -  0-3

Chelsea (A) - 0-3

Manchester City (H) - 0-2

Everton (A) - 0-3

QPR (A) - 0-2 

Next five fixtures: Tottenham (H), West Ham (A), Southampton (H), Burnley (A), Crystal Palace (A) 

He should feature against Spurs on Sunday, and Lambert expects his team to end their troubles in front of goal when Mauricio Pochettino’s side come to town.

‘We need to be more clinical,’ he said after their 2-0 defeat to QPR on Monday. 

‘They will come out of the traps against Tottenham on Sunday, with Benteke, Weimann, Agbonlahor and Bent there are goals in the team.

‘We know we will be all right in that department. My main concern is giving goals away.

‘Benteke’s injury was really severe and that was only his second game. It is a long time out and he might take six or seven games to get up to speed. There are signs that he is getting there.’
