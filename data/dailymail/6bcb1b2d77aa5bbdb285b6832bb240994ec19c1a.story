This big bundle of joy is Jack George Butt who gave his delighted parents an extra special reason to celebrate St George's Day.

The not-so-little newborn baby weighed in at a whopping 13lb and 5oz when he was delivered by Caesarean Section at Medway Maritime Hospital in Kent.

The child, who ranks as one of Britain's heaviest babies, returned home with mother Abby Morgan and fianc√© Jason Burt this week.

Happy family: Abby Morgan has given birth to one of Britain's biggest babies, Jack George Burt who weighs in at a whopping 13lbs, five and a half ounces

Despite only being a week old, Jack is already wearing clothes for babies aged six months.

The original plan had been for Abby to have a natural birth and she was induced twice, but 13 days after her due date she was forced to have a C-Section.

Abby, 36, said: 'I think everybody was shocked. Jason was cuddling him and everyone was saying we want to get him on the scales.'

The mother-of-two from Halfway in Isle of Sheppey, Kent, already has a son called Ben, seven, who weighed a more average 7lb 13oz when he was born.

Abby, who works with adults with learning difficulties, added: 'There is no medical reason for Jack's size. He was tested for diabetes at birth and was cleared.

'We used to joke about having a 9lb baby and I said I'm not having one that reaches double figures.'

Britain's biggest baby was Guy Carr, born in Barrow, Cumbria in 1992 and weighing in at 15lbs 8ozs.

In February Gemma Tevendale of Swindon in Wiltshire gave birth naturally
to the country's heaviest ever girl - Suzie Gzowski who weighed 12lb 
12oz.
