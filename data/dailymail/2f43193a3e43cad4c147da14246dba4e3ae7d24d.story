A war veteran who died with just a handful of relatives to mourn him has been given a hero's funeral after a care home manager sent out a hopeful email which went global.

About 500 people attended the funeral today of ex-Royal Marine Albert Vaughan who died on his 89th birthday at a Staffordshire nursing home last month.

Standard bearers and members of the public lined the streets as Mr Vaughan's coffin was taken to St Editha's Church, in Tamworth.

A fitting farewell: Hundreds of people attended the funeral of war veteran Albert Vaughan after the nursing home where he died sent an e-mail which went global

It comes after staff at Marmion 
Nursing Home in the town said they only knew a handful of relatives who could attend
- so manager Chris Homer sent a speculative email to the National 
Ex-Services Association explaining what had happened.

Within hours people across the planet had responded - from as far away as Australia, India and Dubai.

Mr Vaughan had spent the last 21 years of his 
life at the nursing home and died of 
pneumonia just two hours after his birthday.

Final send off: Mr Vaughan's coffin leaves the church watched by standard bearers and members of the public

Service: The coffin, which is decorated with a poppy wreath is flanked by standard bearers in the church

Commemoration: A photo of Mr Vaughan in his Royal Marine uniform sits on top of the coffin as his life is commemorated

A funeral service with full military honours was held at St. Editha's church in Tamworth for Albert Vaughan

Dignified: Veterans from around the world travelled to Tamworth to show their respect to Mr Vaughan, who served in the Royal Marines

He had served in the Royal Marines in
World War II but passed away with only a few family members left after 
his daughter's death two years ago.

Mr Homer said: 'The response has been phenomenal, my phone just hasn't stopped ringing.

'It's just all been so touching. After learning of Albert's death I thought "this is a man who has served our country".

'He has done so much for us so I had to do something.

'We've held funerals before of residents
who don't have much family left, and there's usually just a handful of 
staff from the home that attend.'

Honour: Local people lined the street in respectful silence as Mr Vaughan's coffin was driven to St. Editha's church in Tamworth

Crowds turned out to pay their respects to the war veteran, who served with Royal Marines

A touching tribute: Tamworth town centre came to a standstill as strangers paid their respects to Mr Vaughan

A bugler from the Royal British Legion played The Last Post in a fitting tribute to the man who joined the forces as an 18-year-old private.

He served in Malaysia but following a shrapnel injury he was discharged and returned to the UK.

Mr Vaughan's health deteriorated in his later years as he battled mental health issues - he arrived at the nursing home in 1991.

He became a valued member of the 
community at the home, and staff even requested he receive a Veterans Badge given out
to surviving members who served in with the UK Armed Forces.

Respectful crowds and other veterans lined the road as the coffin was carried into the town church

The church was full as mourners gathered to remember the man who initially had no one to attend his funeral

Support from fellow soldiers: Those who attended said they wanted to honour the hero who had risked his life for his country

Chris said: 'When it arrived, the smile on his face was unbelievable. For a gentleman who found it very hard to express emotion, his face just lit up.

'For Albert, it was as though ten Christmases had come at once.'

Mr Vaughan's only surviving family members are his daughter's sister Jose Hayes and her two children.

She said she was grateful for what the care home had done for him.

Ms
Hayes, 52, said: 'This is a fitting tribute to Albert - at the end of 
the day he served our country and should be honoured and recognised for 
this.

Life: The number of people who attended showed how much respect there is for the war veteran

Valued: Revd Vic van den Bergh makes an address during the service. Mr Vaughan was a much-loved member of the community at his nursing home

Gesture: Chris Homer, manager of the Marmion Nursing Home was shocked by the scale of response he received after he sent out an email about Mr Vaughan's funeral

'It's really moving to hear the response and I want to say thank you to Chris. I will be there for my sister, Linda - she loved her dad and was always there for him.

'Care home staff also gave him fantastic care, and helped put Linda's mind at rest.'

Hundreds of former soldiers, and members of the British Legion, attended the funeral. Ex-Royal Fusilier, Michael Caffiy, travelled from Minehead, Somerset, to attend the funeral.

He
said: 'When I saw the email from the care home, I was really moved. 
Albert was a hero who fought for his country and he deserved a proper 
send off.

'He risked his life, and hundreds of us have turned out today to show our respect for that. There are banners here from all over the country, as so many people wanted to show their support.

'A
group of us came down together, but I would have crawled here on my 
hands and knees if I had to - nothing would have stopped me from showing
my support to a fellow soldier.
