A young mother, her one-year-old son and her friend's daughter have been killed after the ATV they were traveling in crashed into a concrete wall and burst into flames.

Andrea Allen, 22, from Indianapolis, was possibly drunk and speeding as she drove with her two sons Jaylen Rawls, 1, and Xavier Rawls, 2, and Nevaeh Dempsey, 2, on a rural Indiana road on Sunday evening.

Jaylen and Nevaeh died on impact and Xavier was pulled out of the resulting inferno by a local fisherman who witnessed the wreck.

Xavier was rushed to Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis where he is in stable condition.

His mother was taken by helicopter to an Indianapolis hospital where she later died of her injuries.

'Preliminary investigative conclusions 
indicate excessive speed and alcohol may be contributing factors,' an 
Indiana Department of Natural Resources release stated.

The two boys were visiting their Allen from Harvey, Illinois where their father, Steven Rawls, lives.

Scene: The crash happened on a country road, pictured, in Indiana, near Center Point

State Conservation Officer Lt. 
William Browne says the three toddlers were riding in front of Allen on 
the off-road single-seat 1996 Polaris Sportsman 500 ATV at the time of 
the crash.

Another conservation officer, Chris Sprinstun, told the Indystar.com that the vehicle is not intended to carry that many riders.

The incident occurred shortly after 6 p.m. and followed a call to the Clay County Sheriff's Office reporting an ATV vehicle was 'being operated in a reckless manner' on County Road 200 North, near the town of Center Point.

The off-road vehicle struck a concrete wall adjacent to Country Road and immediately burst into flames.

Fisherman, Franklin Davis Jr., from Indianapolis, witnessed the shocking accident and ran to help, pulling little Xavier from the blazing wreckage, according to the news website.

The crash remains under investigation, and autopsies are planned to determine cause of death.
