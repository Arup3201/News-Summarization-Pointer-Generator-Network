A high school football team should’ve listened to their coach demanding they play until the final whistle.

Vancouver Skyline High (WA) lost 29-24 to Columbia River (WA) High after they blocked a last second field goal, which they thought ended the game – except the ball was never whistled dead.

Ahead 24-23 in the waning moments of a tense game, Vancouver Skyline blocked a field goal attempt by Columbia River and stormed off the field in celebration.

Columbia River’s place holder can be seen next to the live ball slumped over in the agony of defeat while Vancouver celebrated in the ecstasy of what they thought was victory.

An alert Columbia River player, having not heard the whistle blow, picked up the ball and started running towards the end zone.

The game was over due to premature celebration.

Tough way to lose
