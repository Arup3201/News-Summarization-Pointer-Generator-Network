Is Cardiff the right move for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer?

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer insisted he will have the final say on all footballing matters at Cardiff City after he was confirmed as their new manager.

Such assurances from chairman Mehmet Dalman and owner Vincent Tan were one of the central strands of the negotiations that have led the former Manchester United striker from Norway to south Wales.

His arrival came six days after Malky Mackay was sacked in acrimonious circumstances, though elements of uncertainty still surround the nature of the 40-year-old’s deal, with Dalman saying his ‘rolling contract’ was ‘infinite’. Despite repeated questioning, no definitive timescale was given for the contract.

But
the Norwegian has been told he can operate without interference and 
echoed Sir Alex Ferguson when asked if he shared the Scot’s view that a 
manager should be the most important man at a club.

‘I agree,’ Solskjaer said.

There
were reports that Ferguson, who remains close to Mackay, had actually 
advised Solskjaer last week to steer clear of working with Tan. 
Solskjaer dismissed those as ‘absolute nonsense’, before defending the 
Malaysian millionaire after three months of chaos at the club, in which 
numerous allegations of interference have surfaced.

Only one Norwegian has managed in the Premier League and that did not have a happy ending. Egil Olsen took charge of Wimbledon in 1999 but lasted for less than a season as the Dons were relegated from the Premiership (table below is all competitions)

Two more Norwegians have managed in England, although both were in the Championship. Henning Berg was in charge of Blackburn for just 57 days, registering one win, three draws and six defeats in his time there and famously storming out of the club's Christmas party after he was made to go on stage and wear a stocking on his head, and a Michael Jackson wig, and dance on stage.

Stale Solbakken was a disaster at Wolves in the first half of last season, beginning a campaign which was to end in relegation to League One.

‘He’s
the owner, he wants his club to be successful,’ Solskjaer said. ‘He has
ploughed loads of money into the club and he wants it to be successful.
For me, I had a great meeting with him.

‘He
just confirmed to me that this is a man who wants his club to succeed, 
he’s willing to help this club progress and develop into the Premier 
League club. Not everything is as it seems from the outside.’

Dalman
has been a crucial figure in landing Solskjaer, who won two league 
titles and a cup in his three years at Molde, before Tan flew him from 
Norway to London on Wednesday for final discussions.

Solskjaer
said: ‘I had great chats with Mehmet, and I met the owner, and they’ve 
convinced me they want me to be in charge of the football, to take the 
club forward.’

He added: ‘I am very confident that football matters, that is my matter.’

Quite
how this relationship plays out remains to be seen, with Dalman 
insisting a new boardroom structure and ‘culture’ of dialogue will 
preclude the sort of breakdown in relations that contributed to Mackay’s
exit.

For his part, Solskjaer knows that Barclays Premier League survival is the least of Tan’s expectations.

The Ayatollah celebration was originally performed by the singer and fans of Welsh-language punk group U Thant before being adopted by Cardiff fans during the 1990s.

The group's singer watched footage of the funeral of Ayatollah Khomeini and witnessed people doing the movement to express their grief and sadness.

Bluebirds supporters used it during a match against Lincoln City in September 1990 and its popularity quickly grew.

Former chairman Sam Hammam is well-known for performing the Ayatollah in front of travelling Leeds fans during an FA Cup tie in 2002, while current owner Vincent Tan has also celebrated with the unique gesture.

Beyond that, Solskjaer has targeted a 15th-place finish in the table and the scalp of Swansea City.

He
said: ‘I know what I’m going into and I’m so looking forward to it. I’m
going to bring my energy, enthusiasm, football knowledge. I want my 
team to play exciting, attacking football. We want the fans to come here
and be proud of us.

‘I 
will only ask for 100 per cent effort for the players, as I asked from 
myself and as was hammered down, of course, by the gaffer (Ferguson) and
Roy Keane. But that’s the norm.’

He
added: ‘If this season you end up top 15 you are top five of the second
league in the Premier League. And (I would like to finish) above 
Swansea.’

With another 
Ferguson protege entering Premier League management, it will be 
intriguing to see how closely such a mild-mannered man mimics his former
mentor.

Asked if Vincent Tan was considering changing the colour of Cardiff's home shirts back to blue during Thursday's press conference, chairman Mehmet Dalman said he had 'nothing' to say.

He said: ‘I 
have obviously been moulded by him. I have not studied him but I have 
worked under him and had the best teacher in man management or managing a
football club.

‘We 
might be different personalities but for me I have learnt a few tricks 
from him and took advice from him. You think back at times, “What did 
the gaffer do when this and that happened?” So of course I am looking 
through my diaries.

‘I 
was a boring but a reflective man. I always used to write notes when I 
was a coach. I stayed in his team talks, meetings so I have learnt from 
him.’

PS Malky's back and smiling at Celtic

Malky Mackay, the man Solskjaer seems set to replace at Cardiff, was pictured at Parkhead ahead of Celtic's Scottish Premiership match against Partick Thistle.

Mackay, who played for Celtic, was greeted by Lison Lion Bertie Auld and it seemed to take his mind off the acrimony surrounding his sacking by Vincent Tan.
