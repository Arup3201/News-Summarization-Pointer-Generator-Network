The Queen wants to employ someone to become her assistant anniversaries officer as demand for her royal mail soars.  

The assistant anniversaries officer will help with birthdays and dates such as diamond wedding anniversaries and will be paid £20,000. 

Demand for her 100th birthday telegrams are said to be soaring.

The Queen wants to employ someone to become her assistant anniversaries officer as demand for her royal mail soars; the assistant will help deal with demands for her 100th birthday telegrams

According to The Sun, fewer than 3,000 congratulatory telegrams were sent out in 1952, compared to 9,736 birthday wishes in 2011.

Her Majesty also sent 30,359 diamond wedding letters.

During her reign the newspaper says the Queen has sent more than 110,000 birthday messages and 520,000 diamond wedding notes. 

An advertisement for the job reads: 'You will be responsible for dealing with requests from the public to ensure all eligible recipients receive The Queen's congratulatory card.'  

There are now so many people are now reaching their 100th birthday that the little-known Whitehall office responsible for making sure their milestone is celebrated has already had to take on extra staff.

Some 7,517 people have received a Centenarian card from the Palace this year, up from 6,360 in 2013.

The cards are sent to British citizens on their 100th, 105th and every subsequent birthday.

The Department of Work and Pensions, which is responsible for checking ages and sending birthday cards from the Queen, has increased the number of employees involved from one to seven in the past five years.

The number of people over the age of 100 has risen dramatically from around 3,000 in 1983 to more than 13,700 in 1983

Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that there are now 13,780 people over the age of 100 in Britain, compared with just 6,860 in 2000.

It is now estimated one in three children born today will reach 100. 

Margaret Wilberforce-Eke, who leads the DWP team in charge of keeping information on centenarians up to date, said last month: 'Every day we help families mark amazing celebrations. Reaching 100 might be becoming more common, but it is still very special for all those involved.

'It is a privilege to be involved in just a small part of these birthdays – but we hear back that receiving a card is the perfect finishing touch for a great day.'

The DWP Centenarian team, based in Newcastle upon Tyne, contacts people approaching their 100th, 105th and every subsequent birthday who are in receipt of State Pension.

Those not in receipt of State Benefits can make a direct application to Buckingham Palace to receive a celebration card.
