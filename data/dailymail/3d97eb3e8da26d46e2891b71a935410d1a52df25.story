From buildings built by the Nazis to ornate theatres, burnt out hotels and eerie sanatoriums, these are the abandoned buildings that still litter the powerhouse of Europe.

Photographer Daniel Barter, 30, from London travelled to the German capital Berlin and the surrounding countryside to capture buildings in need of work on film.

Far from being resplendent in vintage glory, the deserted music venues and crumbling hospitals are a shadow of their former selves.

German eagle motifs flake off ceilings and concert halls designed for hundreds have not seen a show for years.

Mr Barter said: 'I stumbled into photography via my degree, which was in restoration. My interest in abandonments started really young.

'When I was five my junior school had a derelict aeroplane in an adjoining field. Two of my friends and I climbed over the 10ft green wire mesh fence and entered the plane.

'If I close my eyes I can still picture the switches, dials and smell the leather.

'I find abandoned buildings to photograph by word of mouth or a little bit of research.

'To gain access to some of the locations is quite another story and can involve a lot of climbing, sneaking and hiding.

'The best and most interesting thing about photographing abandoned buildings in Germany has to be the clash between different opposing ideologies that dominated this region in the mid to late 20th century.

'There is almost nothing else similar to it around the globe.

'The way it effected the material fabric of these lost places and the way it continues to effect the region as a whole, is I believe unique.'

There are more than 60 buildings at the sanatorium which are  looking for a new lease of life

Mr Barter's photographs show even the powerhouse of Europe has its fair share of abandoned properties
