We have all gone to lengths to avoid people we don't like - but it appears a group of tigers in Nepal have adopted a 'night shift' to better co-exist with their human neighbors.

The lives of the tigers and people of Chitwan National Park fly in the face of long-held convictions in conservation circles - both sharing exactly the same space, including the same roads and trails .

Jianguo Liu, director of the Center for Systems Integration and Sustainability,Â  and PhD student Neil Carter spent two seasons setting motion-detecting cameras to observe tigers, 
their prey and people who walk the roads and trails of Chitwan, both in 
and around the park.

Chitwan, nestled in a valley of the Himalayas, is 
home to about 121 tigers, while people live on the park's borders, but rely on
the forests for ecosystem services such as wood and grasses.

The Chitwan National Park is home to elephants, rhinos, leopards and tigers - and people who live among the wildlife

The local Chinese population also use the same routes through the forest, but both species seem to function fine on different 'shifts'

The roads also are used by military patrols to 
thwart would-be poachers, and all who venture on the dirt roads and narrow footpaths are 'snared' on Carter's
digital memory cards.

Carter's analysis of the thousands of images show that people and tigers
are walking the same paths, albeit at different times.

Tigers typically
move around at all times of the day and night, monitoring their 
territory, mating and hunting.

But in the study area, Carter and his 
colleagues discovered that the tigers had become creatures of the night.

The camera's infrared lights document a pronounced shift toward 
nocturnal activity.

People in Nepal generally avoid the forests at 
night. Essentially, quitting time for people signals starting time for 
Chitwan's tigers.

So far, it appears tiger population numbers are 
holding steady despite an increase in human population size.

'It's a very fundamental conflict over resources,' Carter said.

'Tigers 
need resources, people need the same resources. If we operate under the 
traditional wisdom that tigers only can survive with space dedicated 
only for them, there would always be conflict.

'If your priority is 
people, tigers lose out. If your priority is tigers, people lose out.'

But he added: 'Conditions for tigers in Chitwan are good.

'Prey numbers
are high, forests outside the park are regenerating, and poaching of 
tigers and their prey is relatively low.

'However, people of different 
stripes, including tourists and local residents, frequent the forests of
Chitwan.

'Tigers need to use the same space as people if they are to 
have a viable long-term future. What we're learning in Chitwan is that 
tigers seem to be adapting to make it work.

'There appears to be a middle ground where you might actually be able to
protect the species at high densities and give people access to forest 
goods they need to live.

'If that's the case, then this 
can happen in other places, and the future of tigers is much brighter 
than it would be otherwise.'
