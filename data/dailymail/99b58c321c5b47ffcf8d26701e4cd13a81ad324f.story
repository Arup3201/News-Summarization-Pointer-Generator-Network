Hate preacher Abu Hamza plotted to set up a headquarters for the Taliban at Finsbury Park Mosque, a court was told.

The hook-handed cleric wanted to use it as a London base for an operation to send up to 3,000 supporters to Afghanistan.

The plan was revealed in a letter to a leader of the extremist group written by a key Hamza aide just three days after the 9/11 attacks.

In the memo, US-born convert James Ujaama, who was sent by Hamza from London to Afghanistan, offers the assistance of ‘devout Muslims’ in Britain.

He told Wakil Ahmad Muttawakil, the then Taliban foreign minister, that they wanted to pledge their allegiance in person to Mullah Omar, the one-eyed Taliban leader.

The letter was presented among prosecution exhibits at a courthouse in New York where Hamza is on trial for terrorism-related offences.

The jury is expected to deliver its verdicts as early as today. If found guilty, Abu Hamza faces life behind bars at a maximum security American prison.

The plan to open a Taliban office in London is outlined in a letter offering assistance, dated September 14, 2001.

Ujaama wrote: ‘We are not a very large
 organisation ... however, we have supporters all around the world who 
are devout Muslims and have given their bayat [oath of allegiance] to 
Amir al-Mumineen [Mullah Omar], the Islamic Emirate and to Taliban.

‘In fact, 3,000 Supporters of Shariah members are waiting for us to respond on how they can travel to personally give bayat.

‘We
 have even made provisions for Taliban to have an office in our London 
masjid [mosque] and give advice to those who want to make hijrah [travel
 to Afghanistan]; give their zakat [charity] and do work to help the 
emirate.

‘Sheikh Abu Hamza 
has personally given me the authority to offer whatever you want from us
 in assistance in helping the emirate.’

Hamza, 56, also known as Abu Hamza al-Masri, has been accused of using Finsbury Park Mosque as a base to spread global terror.

The
 radical Islamist cleric devoted his life to violent jihad and told his 
followers that they had a religious obligation to kill, the Manhattan 
jury has heard.

Prosecutors said he ‘jumped at opportunities across the globe’ in support of violence, whether in Afghanistan, Yemen or the US.

But during four days of evidence Hamza has said he was misunderstood and that his words were ‘taken out of context’.

He
 claimed to be only a ‘mouthpiece’ for rebel groups in Yemen, and a 
‘peacemaker’ during the kidnapping of 16 tourists there in 1998 that 
left four people dead.

And he said that in fact he acted as an intermediary between MI5 and Islamist fanatics to ‘keep the streets of London safe.’

Hamza
 is charged with helping to organise the hostage-taking to obtain the 
release of several Britons who had been arrested in Yemen on suspicion 
of bomb-making. He is also charged with attempting to set up a training 
camp in Bly, Oregon, and of providing support to terrorist groups, 
including al Qaeda in Afghanistan.
