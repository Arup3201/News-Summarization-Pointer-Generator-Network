What normally would have left road kill is nothing short of a miracle. A coyote who was hit by an SUV got stuck in the cars bumper and survived.

Mark Armour was on his way to work at the Waukegan, Illinois train station when he felt his car hit something but didn't see anything.

When he got to the train station parking lot, dozens of people were starting at the front of his car and couldn't believe how a coyote managed to get stuck in his bumper.

Grindtv.com reports that Armour's co-workers originally thought that the coyote was a fox.

Armour called police and an animal control officer came to the scene and was amazed at what she saw.

'He said he thought he hit something, he could feel it, but he didn’t see anything,' said animal control officer Amber Manley to the Lake County News-Sun.

Manley identified the animal as a coyote and couldn't believe the coyote had survived the impact of a speeding car.

'It was even more amazing he survived,' she said.

Manly freed the struggling animal from the bumper and discovered that the animal was calm but in complete shock.

'He seemed docile,' she said.

Manley put the animal in a crate and then loaded it onto the animal control vehicle.

She contacted the director of animal control in Waukegan, Susan Elliot, to gain permission to take the coyote to Flint Creek Wildlife Rehabilitation.

After receiving top of the line medical care, Dawn Keller, the founder of the medical center discovered that the coyote had three fractures in its legs.

Keller gave the coyote antibiotics to prevent infection and also set the fractures.

A day after the crash the coyote was eating again and 'resting comfortably.'

They hope to release the coyote back into the wild in the winter.

'I think it was just an amazing call,' Manley said.

Armour took top his Facebook page to give the coyote the name Vern.

'I am so glad Vern will recover. Thank you so much for taking care of him.'

Armour has offered to donate money towards Vern's recovery.
