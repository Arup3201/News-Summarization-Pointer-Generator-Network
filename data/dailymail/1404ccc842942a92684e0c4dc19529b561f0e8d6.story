A bombed-out building left resembling a doll's house after the front was ripped off by an Israeli air strike has revealed the extent of the property damage in Gaza City.

The image emerged as violence erupted on the West Bank as Israeli and Hamas leaders struggle to negotiate a permanent ceasefire.

Both nations are currently observing a five-day truce in Gaza to allow indirect talks to continue in Cairo, Egypt.

However, Palestinians today took to the streets in a violent outburst after Israeli militants allegedly fired shots across the border.

Outburst: Palestinians on the West Bank threw themselves to the ground as Israeli militants advanced to quell a violent uprising. Activists hurled stones at the soldiers after one 'shot across the border' despite a ceasefire

Chaos: Unarmed civilians ran up to military trucks armed with stones and slabs of concrete to throw at them

Anger: Leaders claim to be 'making progress' with talks but Palestinians took to the streets with fake missiles

Masked activists hurled stones and slabs of concrete at the soldiers who fired tear gas and pellets. 

An Israeli military spokeswoman said 'we have no knowledge' of the alleged cross-border shooting.

The outburst comes as Palestinian officials meeting Qatar revealed they are 'making progress' with their negotiations.

The talks, taking place in Egypt, are meant to secure a substantive end to the monthlong Gaza war and draw up a roadmap for the coastal territory, which has been hard-hit in the fighting.

Hamas is demanding the lifting of the blockade Israel and Egypt imposed after the militant group seized power in Gaza in 2007.

Israel wants the entire territory to be disarmed.

Demands: Palestine wants full control of the border crossings, while Israel wants the territory disarmed

The proposal is believed to include the lifting of some restrictions, which would let Palestine's Western-backed president Mahmoud Abbas assume responsibility for border crossings.

Israeli officials have said little about the negotiations, saying only that the country's security needs must be met.

Hamas negotiators met with the Islamic militant group's leadership in Qatar on Friday to discuss a proposal for a long-term truce with Israel, with an official saying the group was inclined to accept the Egyptian-mediated offer. 

A Hamas official said his group had all but accepted the offer and was currently finalizing the wording.

An Israeli military spokesman said they had 'no knowledge' of the alleged shooting that sparked the riot

'The proposed agreement states in many places that lifting the blockade will come through measures and mechanisms agreed upon between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, and this means Israel will always have the upper hand, and might return the situation on the crossings back to the way it used to be before the war,' he said. He spoke on condition of anonymity because the negotiations were still ongoing.

He said the emerging deal would end hostilities and answer some immediate Hamas needs, including providing materials for reconstruction.

The Gaza blockade remains the main stumbling block. It has greatly limited the movement of Palestinians in and out of the territory of 1.8 million people, restricted the flow of goods into Gaza and blocked virtually all exports.

Devastation: The fighting has killed more than 1,900 Palestinians and 67 Israelis - all but three of them soldiers

Israel says the closure is necessary to prevent arms smuggling, and officials are reluctant to make any concessions that would allow Hamas to declare victory.

Israel, meanwhile, has demanded that Hamas be disarmed, or at the very least be prevented from re-arming, a term that is a virtual non-starter for the militant group.

Hamas has recovered from previous rounds of violence with Israel, including a major three-week air and ground operation in January 2009 and another weeklong air offensive in 2012. It still has an arsenal of several thousand rockets, some with long ranges and relatively heavy payloads.

The current cease-fire is the longest to be declared since the war broke out last month. The fighting has so far killed more than 1,900 Palestinians, the majority of them civilians, according to Palestinian and U.N. officials. Israel has lost 67 people, all but three of them soldiers.
