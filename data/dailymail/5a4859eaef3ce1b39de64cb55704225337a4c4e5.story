This pampered pooch has a new look to dye for.

Pookah's quirky new makeover was meant to make him look just like a panda - but the pet also now looks a lot like a raccoon.

Judging by these photos though, he is loving his new black and white style.

According to animal stylist Catherine Miles, from Darwin, Australia, using colour and clippers to transform your pet is now a popular trend.

Indeed, the creative colouring has seen everything from poodles to pussy cats getting a special new look.

Ms Miles said: 'It's all about creativity. It's a little bit of a fashion statement and it's getting more common.'

However, she warned that the sprucing up of pets should only be done by a professional who uses specially created dyes that are safe for animals.

'Don't ever use people products or try it at home.'

Human hair dye is notoriously 
dangerous for a pet that can easily turn around and lick the chemicals 
off its coat, and can cause irritation to the skin underneath the hair.

dogs' coats became a huge fad in China in 2010 when pictures began to 
emerge of owners and petting zoos that had dyed their dogs to look like 
wild animals.
