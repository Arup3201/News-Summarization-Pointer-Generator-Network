A former NFL offensive lineman who played for six teams before opting for a quiet family life in Georgia has died suddenly aged just 46.

Scott Adams died on Monday in Oconee County near Athens but the cause of his death has not been disclosed.

Photographs taken in recent weeks and uploaded to Facebook show Adams swimming and grinning as he spent time with his family - with no sign anything was amiss.

He leaves behind his wife, Tishara, and their three-year-old daughter, Dyllan. On his Facebook page, the proud father lavishes praise on his blonde-haired toddler.

Loss: Scott Adams is pictured playing for the Minnesota Vikings in 1992. He died suddenly on Monday aged 46

Adams was born in Lake City, Florida and played football for the University of Georgia from between 1985 and 1988.

He was a second-team All-Southeastern Conference selection in 1988 and was named an All-America honorable mention by The Associated Press.

Adams played six seasons in the NFL. He began his career as an offensive guard with Minnesota in 1992 and started a career-high nine games in 1993 with the Vikings.

Adams also played for New Orleans, Chicago, Tampa Bay and Atlanta before finishing with the Atlanta Falcons in 1997. He played a total of 58 games for the NFL.

Family: After leaving the Falcons in 1997, he married wife Tishara. They had a daughter, Dyllan, now three

Talent: After moving to back to Athens, GA - where he attended college - he worked as a mortgage banker

After retiring from the game, he began working in mortgage banking, eventually launching his own company, Adams Group/Cornerstone Home Lending, in Athens, Georgia in 2007.

He also married wife Tishara Jespersen, who gave birth to their daughter Dyllan in April 2010.

A former classmate and friend, Atlanta Journal-Constitution sports writer Chip Towers, paid tribute to the ex-NFL player in a column in the newspaper on Monday.

'Scott Adams died Monday in Oconee County,' he wrote. 'It was sudden and unexpected. He would have turned 47 on Sept. 28th, the day Georgia plays host to LSU. He would have been at the game.'

He said he always remembered Adams with 'a big grin on his face, always moving from one endeavor to another, no matter how difficult and challenging'.

He pointed out that Adams career had not been without those challenges.

'He didn't get drafted,' Towers pointed out. 'He fought for roster spots and played on practice squads. But when it was all said and done, he played nearly 10 years in the NFL with six different teams.'

He noted that although they were not close, he would see the family heading to church on Sunday morning and would always remember Adams for his grit.

Tim Worley, an All-American tailback in 1988, also paid tribute to the ex-footballer - remembering his friend as 'a man of God' and 'one of the most talkative linemen I've ever played with'.

'Scott Adams was a versatile warrior,' he said. 'He could play any position on the offensive line...

'Scott was also just an awesome human being that people loved to be around. He was full of life, full of energy, always revved up in the huddle and whenever you saw him, you were ready to play.'

Georgia said funeral arrangements have not yet been finalized.
