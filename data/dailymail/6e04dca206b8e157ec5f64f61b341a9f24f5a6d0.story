Jailed: Crisp factory worker Colin Goulding, 31, who started the blaze by having a sneaky cigarette

A crisp factory worker who went into a storeroom to have a crafty cigarette accidentally started a huge fire which caused a £25million blaze and cost 100 of his colleagues their jobs.

Colin Goulding, 31, was jailed for over six years for starting the blaze which was described by a judge as the 'most expensive arson' he had ever seen.

The court heard it took 65 firefighters to put out the blaze at the Real Crisp factory in Crumlin, near Newport, South Wales.

Goulding was worried about being caught smoking by his bosses so threw the cigarette away in a hurry, the court was told.

But it landed in a pile of crisp packet wrappers starting a blaze which engulfed the factory in just 10 minutes.

Everyone lost their jobs - including 
the defendant's parents who also worked in the factory - when the owner's 
decided not to rebuild it.

Judge Philip Richards told Goulding: 'This was a ridiculous thing to do. Lighting a cigarette in this warehouse would have been, to any rational person, a most unwise act.

'I accept you didn’t mean to cause this fire, which had devastating consequences for your own family and so many others.'

He was working on a night shift on a production line boxing packets of crisps when he sneaked off for a cigarette at 3am, the court heard.

Danger: Goulding is seen walking off to have a cigarette moments before the fire started. As a result, more than 100 people lost their jobs

Caught in the act: Colin Goulding, 31, is seen sneaking off into a storeroom for a cigarette moments before the fire started

Blaze: The huge fire rips through the factory, near Newport, South Wales. The whole building had to be demolished and all the workers lost their jobs

Wreckage: The burnt out shell of a factory after the blaze had been put out by a team of 65 firefighters last September

Prosecutor Matthew Roberts said: 'He admits breaking the healthy and safety codes and company policy.

'The reason these rules are in place is because one is dealing with extremely flammable material in an extremely volatile environment.

'He had no legitimate reason to enter the goods warehouse - all he needed for his work was within arms reach of his packaging station.

'But he left to have a cigarette, walked into the goods warehouse and lit it. He moved into the storage area when he thought someone was behind him so he discarded it.

'The seat of the fire was in the packaging area, it’s obvious to anyone that discarding a lit cigarette in this area carried a risk to life and property.

Blaze: The court heard that Goulding, who is of low intelligence, did not even realise it was him that had started the fire

Fire: The court heard there were there were 40 tons of potatoes and 60,000 litres of cooking oil on the site when the fire started

'The fire started easilly and spread quickly causing irreversible damage to virtually all of the factory. The damage was so extensive that the factory burnt to the ground and was entirely demolished.

'It’s fortunate, and through no fault of this defendant, that no one was hurt or killed.'

The factory made Irish crisp Taytos, British supermarket own brands and crisps for international buyers.

The court heard that at the time of the blaze on September 20, 2012, there were 40 tons of potatoes and 60,000 litres of cooking oil on the site.

The court heard Goulding, who is of low intelligence, had no idea his cigarette started the fire.

He filmed the blaze on his camera phone - as his colleagues rushed to escape - before calling 999.

Father-of-one Goulding, of Abertillery, South Wales, admitted arson being reckless as to whether life was endangered.

Wreckage: Everyone lost their jobs - including the defendant's parents who also worked in the factory - when the owner's decided not to rebuild it

Huw Evans, defending, said: 'He did not intend to start the fire - this was a careless and avoidable act - but it was not intentional.

'He carelessly discarded the cigarette but as far as he was concerned, when he discarded it it was in a place where no fire could have started.

'He didn’t appreciate it was dangerous, but maybe he should have done.'

Judge Richards told him: 'There’s no doubt that most people would understand what you did to be a wholly reckless act.'

'This is far and away the most serious arson I have ever contended with - I’ve not seen a case where the damage amounts to anything like this.

'The cost was not merely financial but devasting to the community, to fellow employers and to your parents.'

He was given a total of six years and three months behind bars.

Warning: All workers at the Real Crisps factory knew they were not allowed to smoke because of the health and safety risk, the court heard
