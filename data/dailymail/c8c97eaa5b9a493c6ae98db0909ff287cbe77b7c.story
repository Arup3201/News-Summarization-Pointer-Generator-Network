Apple's healthcare technology is spreading quickly among major U.S.
hospitals, showing early promise as a way for  doctors to
monitor patients remotely and lower costs.

Fourteen of 23 top hospitals contacted by Reuters said they
have rolled out a pilot program of Apple's HealthKit service -
which acts as a repository for patient-generated health
information like blood pressure, weight or heart rate - or are
in talks to do so.

The pilots aim to help physicians monitor patients with such
chronic conditions as diabetes and hypertension.

The new Health app on iOS 8 features a dashboard (pictured) showing all the user's health and ﬁtness data. However, the firm was today forced to delay apps using the service from being distributed.

Apple's HealthKit works by gathering data from sources such as glucose measurement tools, food and exercise-tracking apps and Wi-fi connected scales.

HealthKit is not an app but a back-end framework that allows third-party apps to sync with Apple's new and proprietary health tracking app, Health.

This lets users chart metrics like weight, sleep and calorie intake.

Apple rivals
Google and Samsung Electronics, which
have released similar services, are only just starting to reach
out to hospitals and other medical partners.

Such systems hold the promise of allowing doctors to watch
for early signs of trouble and intervene before a medical
problem becomes acute. That could help hospitals avoid repeat
admissions, for which they are penalized under new U.S.
government guidelines, all at a relatively low cost.

The U.S. healthcare market is $3 trillion, and researcher
IDC Health Insights predicts that 70 percent of healthcare
organizations worldwide will invest by 2018 in technology
including apps, wearables, remote monitoring and virtual care.

Those trying out Apple's service included at least eight of
the 17 hospitals on one list ranking the best hospitals, the
U.S. News & World Report's Honor Roll. Google and Samsung had
started discussions with just a few of these hospitals.

Apple's HealthKit works by gathering data from sources such
as glucose measurement tools, food and exercise-tracking apps
and Wi-fi connected scales. 

The company's Apple Watch, due for
release in April, promises to add to the range of possible data,
which with patients' consent can be sent to an electronic
medical record for doctors to view.

Ochsner Medical Center in New Orleans has been working with
Apple and Epic Systems, Ochsner's medical records vendor, to
roll out a pilot program for high-risk patients. 

The team is
already tracking several hundred patients who are struggling to
control their blood pressure. 

The devices measure blood pressure
and other statistics and send it to Apple phones and tablets.

'If we had more data, like daily weights, we could give the
patient a call before they need to be hospitalized,' said Chief
Clinical Transformation Officer Dr. Richard Milani.

Sumit Rana, chief technology officer at Epic Systems, said
the timing was right for mobile health tech to take off.

'We didn't have smartphones ten years ago; or an explosion
of new sensors and devices,' Rana said.

Apple has said that over 600 developers are integrating
HealthKit into their health and fitness apps.

The new Health App will use a special dashboard to show user's exactly how their health is - and can alert doctors if something is wrong

Many of the hospitals told Reuters they were eager to try
pilots of the Google Fit service, since Google's Android
software powers most smartphones. Google said it has several
developer partners on board for Fit, which connects to apps and
devices, but did not comment on its outreach to hospitals.

Samsung said it is working with Boston's Massachusetts
General Hospital to develop mobile health technology. The firm
also has a relationship with the University of California's San
Francisco Medical Center.

Apple's move into mobile health tech comes as the Affordable
Care Act and other healthcare reform efforts aim to provide
incentives for doctors to keep patients healthy. The aim is to
move away from the 'fee for service' model, which has tended to
reward doctors for pricey procedures rather than for outcomes.

Still, hospitals must decide whether the difficulty of
sorting through a deluge of patient-generated data of varying
quality is worth the investment.

'This is a whole new data source that we don't understand
the integrity of yet,' said William Hanson, chief medical
information officer at the University of Pennsylvania Health
System. 

Apple has recruited informal industry advisors, including
Rana and John Halamka, chief information officer of Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, to discuss
health data privacy and for introductions to the industry.

The company said it had an 'incredible team' of experts in
health and fitness and was talking to medical institutions,
healthcare and industry experts on ways to deliver its services.

A few hospitals are also exploring how to manage the data
that is flowing in from health and fitness-concerned patients,
whom many in Silicon Valley refer to as the 'worried well.'

Beth Israel's Halamka said that many of the 250,000 patients
in his system had data from sources such as Jawbone's Up
activity tracker and wirelessly connected scales.

'Can I interface to every possible device that every patient
uses? No. But Apple can,' he said.

Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles is developing visual
dashboards to present patient-generated data to doctors in an
easy-to-digest manner.

Experts say that there will eventually be a need for common
standards to ensure that data can be gathered from both Apple's
system and its competitors.

'How do we get Apple to work with Samsung? I think it will
be a problem eventually,' said Brian Carter, a director focused
on personal and population health at Cerner, an electronic
medical record vendor that is integrated with HealthKit.
