She shot to fame playing a bumbling and
scruffy shop assistant in her eponymous BBC sitcom.

But Miranda Hart has made no secret of her desire to 
lose weight, admitting she finds criticism about her figure and appearance hard to deal with.

In recent weeks, the 40-year-old comedian has been showing off a more svelte figure out and about in London, especially at the Glamour Woman of the Year Awards last month where she hired celebrity stylist Angie Smith to give her a dramatic £2,000 new look.

And now the Call The Midwife star is said to be sharing her weight loss secrets with the world after reportedly signing a deal to release her own fitness DVD.

The brunette entertainer is said to be devising her own fitness routine - without the help of experts - just in time for Christmas.

A source told The Sun: 'Miranda is a woman of many talents, but even her biggest fans will be surprised that she is doing this workout DVD.

'Washboard stomachs and finely toned biceps are not something you would normally associate with her.

'But whatever the routine ends up being, there is one thing that it will definitely be - funny.'

Miranda is no stranger to gruelling exercise challenges.

She took part in a 1,000 mile bike ride from John O'Groats to Land's End for Comic Relief back in 2010 saying at the time: 'I was very sporty at school, but things have gone downhill since.

'Suddenly I was forced into training sessions which involved very worrying terms like "squats", "lunges" and "core muscles". It turns out I had no muscles at all - we couldn't find them.'

The star has made no secret of her 
ambitions to slim down in the past, admitting she feels as though she's 
'wearing a fat suit' at times.

She explained: 'The reason I'm set on losing weight is that I'm not naturally this big, I'm naturally lean.

'When I put on weight, I feel like this isn't me, this isn't right. I feel like I'm wearing a fat suit.
I went with it for a bit, and didn't mind it, but I want to get it off for health's sake, so I can go into a 
new decade feeling healthy.'

But Miranda added that her main downfall is just her love of food.

She
said: 'I've just got such a big appetite. If I was naturally this size,
I would just crack on with it and go, "Well, that's just me."

'If
you're naturally a certain size I think it suits you and you can see 
that. There's no point in trying to conform for the sake of it.

'People 
are meant to be different shapes, and their different shapes are so 
interesting and, ultimately, why people fall in love with them.'

Miranda also previously admitted that she has found comments about her weight and appearance hard to deal with in the past.

She
said: 'As a woman, it seems you can't just be a comedian, you're always
classed as something else too, whether that's "beautiful", 
"pint-sized", "larger-than-life" or in my case "Hattie Jacques-esque", 
"the giraffe", "big".

'I'm
quite a confident person in many ways, but there's only so much you can
hear about being compared to Hattie Jacques. For the record she was a 
comedy goddess, but she was 25 stone. I hope I'm right in saying I'm not
in any way nearly 25 stone.'
