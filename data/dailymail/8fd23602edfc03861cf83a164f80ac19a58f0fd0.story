A woman has been accused of running into a school wielding a baseball bat in her underwear.

Chesie Lawton, 23, has been charged with  trespassing at Westside Elementary in Memphis, Tennessee, moments before hundreds of children were due to arrive for their lunch.

According to WMC5, the first officers on scene were flagged down by a teacher who said the woman was 'acting out' during the bizarre disturbance. 

Chesie Lawton, 23, has been charged with criminal trespassing Westside Elementary in Memphis, Tennessee. Officers said she was 'acting out' and screaming while wielding a baseball bat

Officials say the woman came onto campus and entered the cafeteria through a back door while screaming.

Reports from earlier in the day suggest she had been running round the neighbourhood with her shirt on, but then removed it before entering the school. 

According to an incident report, 'officers opened the door and the female tried to get away. The female was yelling and acting out. She was nervous and squirming all over the place.' 

A statement by Shelby County Schools said: 'This person entered the building through a door located in the rear of the building.'

A statement from Shelby County Schools suspects she may have been able to get in because one of the doors was not locked properly

'This is not a public entrance/exit or an entrance/exit used by students. 

'All exterior doors are designed to lock automatically when pulled shut; however, it appears someone who used the door accidentally failed to shut it completely. 

'This incident did not occur in the presence of any children, and police responded within a few minutes.'

However parents were concerned that they were not told about the intrusion that could have harmed their children. 

Tori Fink told WMBF: 'The school didn't notify any parents. No way, form or fashion.'

Police say Lawton also has a warrant out for her arrest in Millington. She is locked up in the Shelby County jail on $100 bond. 

According to the New York Daily News, Lawton told the officers she had problems with her diabetes. 

However it is not clear how she connected those health issues to her odd behavior. 

Parents at the school reacted angrily to the alleged trespassing, saying they were not notified 'in any form' even though the children could have been harmed
