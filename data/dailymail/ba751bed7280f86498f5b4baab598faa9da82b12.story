Father and doctor Ian Davis is in a race against time, before his body and eventually his life succumb to the aggressive, motor neurone disease. 

The Melbourne medicine man had dreams of one day curing leukaemia but after being diagnosed with the terrible disease three years ago, he had to give up work and concentrate his time with his family, wife Mel and newborn son Archie.

But while his future is grim he has vowed to continue living his life to the fullest.

Ian's goal is to cross off as many things from his bucket list as possible and that has even included jumping out of a plane.

'While I can, I still have those big dreams and I'm going to try to do what I can to make them real,' he told 60 Minutes.

Dr Davis also took on the MND ice bucket challenge and he did it in the nude, while one of his most memorable times taking the stage in a wheelchair with Pearl Jam, his favourite band.

'I've never hit a tambourine so hard in my life,' he said.

He also made his own brand of beer, Cavalier Courage, with the profits to go to motor neurone disease research.

But his biggest achievement whilst tackling the cruel disease, that has ravaged his body, was surviving to see his baby son Archie born.

'I never thought I would be a dad and to now finally see him in the flesh and to know that half of me is in there, and that'll be there after I'm gone is pretty exciting and I'm pretty proud of him.' 

Another challenge for Ian has been a tandem Odyssey with mate and father of two Scott Sullivan, who also had the disease.

The pair took off on an epic ride from Brisbane to Sydney, on a tandem bike for two, to raise money for research into the disease

'Together we can achieve this and do it,' Scott told 60 Minutes. 

'An amazing experience,' said Ian. 

Scott Sullivan , friend of Ian, also had the disease and the pair decided to do an epic ride from Brisbane to Sydney to raise funds. Scott (pictured) aged 42, died of the disease 11 months after the ride

And they did finishing the gruelling trek in Manly.

But Scott, aged 42, was taken by the disease 11 months after the two friends took off on their journey, leaving behind his wife and two kids.

He had battled the disease for more than two years.

While Ian has lived to see the birth of his son Archie, he had prepared for the worst, knowing there was a cruel ending that lied ahead.

He made movies of him reading children's books because he was worried he wouldn't be able to read to his son.

'My voice is starting to go just a little bit so I'm a little bit worried about not being able to read to you,' he said in one of the videos.

Professor Dominic Rowe, is the foremost authority in Australia on MND, which claims 750,000 Australians a year, that's two people every day.

'It's a bastard, it respects no one, you wouldn't wish it on your worst enemy,' he told 60 Minutes.

'It robs you of your ability to be mobile, it robs you of your ability to write, to look after yourself, to brush your teeth to put on your socks to tie your shoes, it ultimately robs you of your ability to breathe, to swallow, to talk and then it takes your life.' 

With a team at Macquarie University hospital, Dr Rowe is leading cutting edge research for this terrible disease.

He is turning zebra fish into guinea pigs hoping that one day what they know as therapy treatment can be turned into a cure.  

Dr Ian Davis continues to battle the disease, which will eventually stop him from walking and talking
