The boss of Domino’s Pizza said yesterday he could create 1,000 jobs tomorrow – but too many British people do not want the work.

Lance Batchelor, the takeaway chain’s chief executive, said it was becoming ‘harder and harder to hire staff, especially in London and the South East’.

‘We could fill 1,000 jobs across the UK tomorrow if we could get candidates to apply for them,’ he said.

Around 22,500 people work for Domino’s
 in the UK but Mr Batchelor told the Evening Standard: ‘Every branch in 
London is operating at less than full capacity because of the problem 
securing labour.’’

He added: ‘It is particularly difficult to get drivers and people to work in production.’

His
 comments came after the former boss of Marks & Spencer, Sir Stuart 
Rose, also attacked the work ethic of many Britons and said it was wrong
 to criticise  immigrants prepared to work for lower salaries.

Sir
 Stuart added: ‘It is up to people to decide whether they want to do the
 work for the pay that is being offered. If they don’t, somebody else is
 there to do it. What’s wrong with that?’

The comments come amid fears 
that the UK will see an influx of immigrants from Bulgaria and Romania 
when working restrictions are lifted next month.

Last week Romania’s Labour minister said Britain should be grateful so
 many Romanians filled jobs Britons were unwilling to do.

Mariana 
Campeanu said Romanian migrants contributed ‘greatly’ to Britain’s gross
 domestic product and criticised feelings of ‘racism and xenophobia’ 
towards her countrymen.

Sir Stuart Rose: 'There are a lot of people who complain about their lot'

His remarks came after Sir Stuart Rose said Romanians and Bulgarians and other immigrants should not be blamed for coming to the UK if Britons were not prepared to do menial jobs.

He said: ‘I’m a free market economist – we operate in a free market. If these people want to come here, and work the hours they are prepared to work for the wages they are prepared to work for, then so be it.’

He added: ‘I know people will look at me and say “It’s all right for you”, but I started off with pretty well nothing, I did a lot of menial jobs when I was young. I didn’t worry about the status of the job – I was more worried about my self-esteem and the fact I had a job. In fact I would look myself in the mirror and say, “I’ve earned a few bob”.

Sir Stuart told Sky News there were increasing signs the economy had turned the corner.

He said: ‘If you go outside of London, companies are recruiting again. There are real signs things are beginning to move.

'We can argue about the quality of the recovery, but I think of it like a football match. A win is a win. 

‘We can argue afterwards the quality of 
the win, the quality of the play, but we can argue about that later – a 
win is a win and we are winning.

Anger: Sir Stuart's comments came after the Romanian Minister for Labour Mariana Campeanu (left) said Britons should be grateful for migrant workers and attacked what she called 'racism and xenophobia'

‘Many companies are preparing to re-invest. And it’s wrong to say it’s London-centric, it’s a UK-centric thing. There are some good things happening.’

Sir Stuart, who is now the chairman of online grocer Ocado, said Marks & Spencer would have a good Christmas.

Asked about rival Tesco’s sales plunge, he said the supermarket giant was simply playing catch-up after being ‘wrong-footed’.

Sir Stuart added: ‘It’s what happens to countries, to big business and it’s a phrase that was said to me once.

‘If you don’t look out of the window every day you will look out one day and see the world has passed you by. And I think that’s what happened to Tesco.

‘They worked hard expanding their business into a global presence and they milked the UK too hard, using the cash from the UK cow.

‘When they looked out of the window they realised the UK was not as structurally sound as it could have been and they hadn’t kept abreast of some of the trends. They found themselves wrong-footed.

‘Catching up when you’re wrong-footed is a massive task, but they have to keep going. It is still a fine business.’
