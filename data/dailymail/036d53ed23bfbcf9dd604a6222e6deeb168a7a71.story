A cruise ship hit and killed a whale and dragged it into the Hudson River this month adding to a growing number of strikes along the East Coast this year.

The Huffington Post reports that there were three whale strikes recently, one in which a cruise ship hit a sei whale and no one made the horrific discovery until it arrived at the port, said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

NBC reports that a dead 30-foot whale was found on the Brooklyn side of New York Harbor after it was struck the 144,000 ton Norwegian Cruise Line ship called the Breakaway.

Marine biologists conduct a necropsy on an over 55 foot long finback whale on a dock in Jersey City, N.J. that was stuck on the bow of a container ship

The whale was 45-years-old and a necropsy found that the whale suffered blunt force trauma and broken ribs linking a cruise ship crash as the cause of death.

The Huffington Post reports that another sei whale was found dead and attached to a ship that was docking near Philadelphia recently.

There was also a third whale strike involving a fin whale but no more details will be available until the NOAA finishes their investigation. 

'Nobody wants to hit a whale,' said Marjorie Mooney-Seus, a spokeswoman. 'So we want people to have a greater awareness that they're out there now.

According to the NOAA the average rate of whale strikes is about one every few weeks compared to three in the past few weeks.

The NOAA reported that there were 28 recorded whale strikes in the Northeast between 2006 and 2010.

A spokesman for the Marine Mammal Stranding Center said it is not uncommon for whales like this deceased fin whale to make their way into shipping lanes as they travel up and the down the East Coast

A National Marine Fisheries Service survey found that worldwide there were 292 confirmed whale strikes from 1975 through 2002.

Rob DiGiovanni who runs a marine mammal rescue group on Long Island told The Huffington Post that that he's been seeing 'more evidence of shift strikes and that's definitely a concern.'

In the past there would be years in between whale strikes but now there are a couple reported every year said DiGiovanni.

There have been no reported strikes of endangered North Atlantic right whales.

DiGiovanni and his group hope to find out why whale strikes are on the rise and whether they are related to to a change in food sources, more ships, or more whales.

For instance, off the coast of Boston, school of fish called sea lance have made the Massachusetts Bay a 'whale feeding ground.'Laura Howes of Boston Harbor Cruises said that twenty to thirty whales are being spotted on every whale watching excursion which is 10 times the usual amount.
