Britain could become bogged down in a Vietnam-style conflict in Mali for years, MPs and military experts warned last night.

As David Cameron ordered 330 troops to the troubled West African state to support the French-led assault on Al Qaeda-affiliated insurgents, alarmed military commanders raised fears of a ‘mission creep’.

The Prime Minister’s decision, reached after top-level talks with Paris, represents a major escalation of British efforts to tackle Islamists behind the uprising in Mali and the massacre at the In Amenas gas plant in Algeria.

Guarantee: Fears have been expressed about British involvement despite Defence Secretary Philip Hammond saying there was 'no intention' of UK units being involved in combat

Mr Cameron will offer British support
to track down the terrorists behind the Algerian hostage crisis in 
which six Britons died, as he travels there to ‘pay his respects’ to 
those killed.

He will also hold talks with the 
Prime Ninister Abdelmalek Sellal and President Abdelaziz Bouteflika on 
dealing with the growing threat from Al Qaeda in the region, and attempt
to smooth over diplomatic relations which were severely strained in the
initial phase of the crisis.

Mr Cameron went public with his frustration that Mr Sellal launched a rescue attempt without telling the UK.

But the British PM will use the trip 
to step up support for defeating terrorists in the region, including 
offering up to 330 military personnel.

Ministers insisted the troops’ role 
would be limited to training African soldiers and providing experts in 
intelligence, surveillance and logistics, while Defence Secretary Philip
Hammond said there was ‘no intention’ of UK units being involved in 
combat.

But it fuelled fears that UK forces could be sucked deeper into another open-ended conflict in a Muslim country.

The former Armed Forces minister Sir Nick Harvey said the number of British troops involved could ‘begin to climb quite rapidly’ if the situation on the ground changed, and warned they would be needed for ‘a good many years’.

The latest deployment comes as the Government continues withdrawing troops from Afghanistan which has left 440 British servicemen and women dead and thousands more wounded in 12 years of fighting.

Raising the grim prospect of being 
dragged into yet another military quagmire, ex-Labour cabinet minister 
Frank Dobson said: ‘The American catastrophe in Vietnam started off with
a deployment of troops in a training capacity.’

General
Sir Mike Jackson, the former head of the Army, warned that the 
intervention could lead to ‘protracted guerilla warfare’ with 
insurgents.

Helping out: Two C-17 Globemaster transport planes (one pictured) supported by 20 RAF personnel to fly French troops, equipment and supplies

In a statement to the Commons, Mr Hammond outlined the UK’s deployment to the region.

Rather than waging war directly, the British mission will involve: Up to 40 military personnel under EU command training local soldiers or establishing a logistics HQ in Mali; a contingent of 200 soldiers and a £5million donation to a separate UN effort to raise an African force capable of fighting the insurgents; around 70 RAF personnel operating a Sentinel R1 spy aircraft from nearby Senegal; one C-17 Globemaster transport plane supported by 20 RAF personnel on standby for three months to fly French troops, equipment and supplies to Mali.

Action: Malian soldiers throw a suspected Islamist extremist into the back of an army truck in Gao, northern Mali

The UK will also allow US air-to-air refuelling tankers to operate from bases in Britain and provide a Merchant Navy roll-on, roll-off ferry to help France shift equipment into landlocked Mali.

Military advisers are expected to be in Mali ‘fairly urgently’. Defence sources said Army troops could be in the warzone as early as next month.

Islamist extremists have destroyed priceless artefacts in Timbuktu.

They destroyed thousands of Islamic manuscripts dating back to 1204.

As part of their hard-line interpretation of Islam, anything considered idolatrous or pagan is destroyed.

The story is all too familiar as the Taliban have committed similar acts in Afghanistan.

Mr Hammond told the Commons: ‘We are very clear about the risks of mission creep and we have defined very carefully the support that we are willing to provide to the French and the Malian authorities.’

But Labour’s defence spokesman Jim Murphy said: ‘The UK commitment to Mali has grown from lending the French two transport aircraft to the deployment of perhaps hundreds of troops to the region.

‘The public are wary and weary of conflict. There will be worries about mission creep and the safety of UK trainers. It is essential you allay those fears.’

It comes after the French and Malian military entered the historic city of Timbuktu as Islamist fighters fled rather than fight.
