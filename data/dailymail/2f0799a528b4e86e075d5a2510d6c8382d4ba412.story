As beautiful as it is here in San Sebastian, the startling contrast between Manchester United and Real Sociedad would not have been lost on David Moyes.

The Volkswagen that collected him from the airport and delivered him to the club’s picturesque Zubieta training ground might not have been much of a culture shock.

But the training ground car park was populated predominantly by Volkswagens, too, suggesting the wage bill is inferior to the average Premier League club, never mind United.

This, however, is not something that will trouble Moyes. Indeed he appears so keen to embrace what this modest football club represents he has decided to select his coaching assistants from staff already at the club after the invitation he extended to Phil Neville to join him was declined.

It says something for the confidence Moyes has in his own ability that he arrived here alone on Wednesday and will remain that way until he builds up more of a rapport with Imanol Alguacil and Erik Bretos.

Alguacil has been promoted from Sociedad’s B team to become Moyes’ deputy; a move that will be popular among players and supporters given that the 43-year-old is a Basque who spent seven years as a player at the club.

Bretos will be his Jose Mourinho to Bobby Robson; a young coach from the club’s successful academy who has a good command of English. That is something Moyes will need until he learns Spanish.

Moyes did say hello in Basque - ‘Kaixo’ - to the assembled media before meeting his new employers and watching Alguacil put his new players through their paces on the training pitch.

His choice of deputies would suggest Moyes is taking a slightly different approach from the one he employed at Old Trafford, even if it was unfair to suggest he dispensed with all of Sir Alex Ferguson’s staff there.

He did, after all, ask Rene Meulensteen to become assistant manager.

Here in San Sebastian they are far more interested in what Moyes achieved at Everton than the difficult 10 months he endured at United.

They see themselves as the Everton of La Liga; a club with aspirations to compete regularly in Europe without breaking the bank.

Xabi Prieto, the Sociedad captain and a one-club man, is thrilled that Moyes has taken the job. ‘He has a very big reputation in the game and all the players want him to do the same for us here as he did with Everton,’ he said.

‘I am excited about what he can bring to the team. He is a big name and I think it is a big thing for the players here to have him.’

Imanol Lizasoain, the Real Sociedad correspondent for the city newspaper Diario Vasco, was similarly enthusiastic.

‘People expect him to give character to the team,’ he said. ‘The last coach was shy, a former teacher who wasn’t really known. He didn’t express himself so much to the players. He was quiet.

‘The fans worried that there was not so much aggression in the team. That is what they expect from Moyes, coming from England and the Premier League. They want him to give the team some fight because there are good players, capable of finishing in the top six.’

On Monday that same local newspaper claimed former West Bromwich Albion manager Pepe Mel was offered the job only hours before Moyes, then contacted the club president - after eight days of considering the offer - to say he would come.

Mel might have been used to apply some pressure when club president Jokin Aperribay always wanted Moyes.

But it is also interesting to read claims here that Moyes agreed to an 18-month contract after initially being offered four years. Aperribay is just happy to have his man.

‘In David Moyes we have a manager with a big name in football with a great reputation,’ he said. ‘It brings a real international coach to Real Sociedad. It is great news for the players and I believe he is someone who can have us back in European football.’

An international name Moyes might be, but on this occasion he has chosen to call more on local expertise.

Former West Brom manager Pepe Mel was also in the running for Soceidad position before Moyes took it
