Richard Gatiss, 25, has been accused of assaulting disabled pensioner Alan Barnes on January 25

This is the first picture of the 25-year-old alleged mugger who has appeared in court, accused of assaulting disabled pensioner Alan Barnes.

Richard Gatiss, from Gateshead, appeared in court this morning charged with assaulting him with intent to rob.   

Frail Mr Barnes, 67, was pushing his bin outside his home in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, on January 25, when he was allegedly knocked to the ground, breaking his collar bone as he landed.

It sparked an internet campaign which raised hundreds of thousands of pounds for Mr Barnes.

During the first hearing of the case at Gateshead Magistrates' Court today, Gatiss spoke only to confirm his name and age.

The defendant was remanded in custody until his next appearance at Newcastle Crown Court on February 24. 

Following the alleged assault, 21-year-old beautician Katie Cutler set up an online fund which generated £330,135 for Mr Barnes and the pair have since become friends.

The disabled pensioner, who  has suffered from sight and growth problems since birth, said he was overwhelmed by the response from well-wishers across the globe.

'I am totally overwhelmed and incredibly grateful to Katie for what she has done for me,' he said. 

'The youth of today don't always get portrayed in a positive light, but I won't ever forget what this young woman has done for me. This is the best thing that has ever happened to me.

'I always knew there were good people in the world, and this has confirmed it.'  

The donations mean he can buy a house of his own for the first time and not count the pennies to get through the week.

More than 24,748 well-wishers donated at an average of just over £13 each, but the appeal has now been halted by Mr Barnes's family.

Ms Cutler wrote on the Alan Barnes Fund page last week saying: 'Good morning, after speaking with Alan & his family, they have asked me to stop any further donations to his fund.

'He is very grateful for all your love, support & donations. We will be having a little presentation to hand him his cheque so i'll keep you all updated. X'

The fund exceeded all expectation and has now been stopped at the request of Mr Barnes and his family after it topped more than £329,526

Gateshead Area Commander Chief Superintendent Andy McDyer said: 'I'd like to reassure people that since this happened we've been relentless in our investigation and in following up lines of enquiry.

'In the early hours of Monday officers made an arrest in connection with the investigation and this man has now been charged and is progressing through the court process.'

Mr Barnes was born with sight and growth problems.
