Worrying: The expenses watchdog established to clean up Parliament was plunged into turmoil last night after four of its five board members quit following a power struggle with the Commons Speaker John Bercow, pictured

The expenses watchdog established to clean up Parliament was plunged into turmoil last night after four of its five board members quit following a power struggle with the Commons Speaker John Bercow.

In a dramatic move, four of the founding board members of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority announced they were stepping down because of concerns about interference by Mr Bercow.

Former High Court judge Sir Scott Baker, former Liberal Democrat leadership contender Jackie Ballard, top businessman Ken Olisa and Professor Isobel Sharp, former president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, announced they were stepping down when their contracts expire in January.

They are said to have been deeply unhappy about Mr Bercow’s demand that they re-apply for their jobs in a process partly overseen by a former MP who repeatedly voted to block publication of MPs’ expenses.

The process to replace them is expected to cost taxpayers £100,000.

In a provocative move, Mr Bercow has appointed the former Conservative MP for Hexham Peter Atkinson to sit on the panel which will appoint Ipsa’s board.

Mr Atkinson, who stepped down at the last election, was one of a group of MPs who tried to block the publication of expenses claims that uncovered the scandal which heaped shame on Parliament three years ago.

He also called for MPs to be given a £20,000 pay rise instead of expenses, and had to repay £100 claimed for a garden shed at his second home in fashionable Richmond in South-West London –  along with £21.86 claimed for tools to put it up.

In a letter to Mr Bercow, Ipsa’s chairman Sir Ian Kennedy, the only remaining member of the board, warned that appointing an MP would be ‘wholly undesirable  given the need for Ipsa to be and to be seen to be independent of political influence’.

Sir Ian also warned that forcing 
board members to re-apply for their jobs would raise questions about 
Ipsa’s independence and damage public trust.

He
 added: ‘It is in nobody’s interest for expenses once again to become a 
live issue in the shape of a debate about the future composition of the 
board and what this might say about Ipsa’s role as an independent 
regulator.

‘I make no 
apologies for pointing to the fact there is much at stake here, not 
least the reputation and future standing of Ipsa and, indeed, the 
reputation of Parliament itself.’

Mr Bercow has come under intense pressure from MPs to water down the new expenses regime, under which they can no longer claim for mortgages, food, furniture and gardening, and have to provide receipts.

MPs have made several attempts to rein in the new watchdog, or even have it closed down.In a letter to Sir Ian, Mr Bercow said it was important that appointments to Ipsa’s board were made after ‘fair and open competition’, even if they were re-appointments.
