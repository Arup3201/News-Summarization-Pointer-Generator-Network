Two 'menacing' life-sized cat bookends are being auctioned almost 70 years after they were 'liberated' from the Nazis.

The carved oak figures are believed to have once belonged to Hitler's Luftwaffe commander Hermann Goering.

They were picked up by RAF Squadron Leader Geoffrey 'Butch' Butcher after the British Army seized the Luftwaffe air base at Jever in Germany in 1945.

The 'menacing' cats are carved from oak and are expected to fetch up to £800 at auction

The Nazi leader apparently used the pair of cats as book-ends for 
leather-bound volumes including the Fuhrer's Mein Kampf.

Following the war, Butcher, the CO of No 6 Air School brought the 'trophy' cats back to England.

They are now expected to fetch up to £800 when they go under the hammer at auction.

Sqdn Ldr Butcher served as a chief flying instructor and was posted to South Africa where he trained RAF airmen before they returned to fight the war against the Luftwaffe in Europe.

Auctioneer Malcolm Claridge, who will sell the cats at auction house Dreweatts, said: 'They are a very distinctive pair of Black Forest-style cat book-ends which Sqdn Ldr Butcher reputedly "liberated" from one of Goering's homes.

'The cats are life-sized and they certainly share a rather distinctive menacing facial expression.'

Goering, who founded Hitler's Gestapo 
secret police, was a prime architect of the Nazi Holocaust. He took his 
own life aged 53 by swallowing a cyanide capsule after he was sentence.

The origin of the cats is unknown and they may have formed part of the 'Collection Goering'.

The Nazi 'magpie' was known for his collection of loot that encompassed paintings, tapestries, jewellery, hunting 
ornaments, altarpieces and rugs.

The bookends were found at the airbase once it was taken over by the British Army.

The RAF took control of the base, later designated RAF Jever, and used between 1952 and 1961, when it was handed back to the German Air Force.

The bookends will be sold at Dreweatts' militaria sale in Bristol on March 28.
