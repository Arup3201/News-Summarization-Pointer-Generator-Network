Chris Reynolds received a shocking delivery from PayPal

As a regular PayPal customer, Chris Reynolds spends no more than $100 a month.

So when the 56-year-old checked his balance with the online money-transfer company recently, it was something of a surprise for him to be told he was a quadrillionaire - making him the world's richest man.

Mr Reynolds, from Delaware County, opened his monthly-statement by email on Friday to discover that his balance was a whopping $92,233,720,368,547,800.

Speaking to the Philadelphia Daily News, Mr Reynolds said he was taken aback by the figure.Â 

'I'm just feeling like a million bucks' he said. 'At first I thought that I owed quadrillions.'

Mr
 Reynolds, who owns PR company Reynolds Ink, has been using PayPal for 10 years and uses it to
 buy and sell items on eBay, including vintage car parts.

After overcoming his shock, he logged onto the PayPal site and saw that his balance was listed as zero.

But this has not stopped him from imagining what he would have done with the money.

Mr Reynolds, who owns a public-relations firm with his wife, said he would have paid off the U.S debt.

As reported by Philly.com, he said: 'I'm a very responsible guy. I would pay the national debt down first.'

He also said he would buy the Philadelphia Phillies baseball team.

However, the apparent good wealth did leave Mr Reynolds feeling somewhat charitable.

He donated $30 to the Democratic slate for Delaware County Council shortly after opening the email.

A PayPal spokesman said the company does not discuss customer-account information for privacy reasons.

Mr Reynolds opened his monthly statement from the online money-transfer company via email and saw that his ending balance was $92,233,720,368,547,800
