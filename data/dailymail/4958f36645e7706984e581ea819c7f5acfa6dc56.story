The Queen visited the Duke of Edinburgh in hospital tonight as Buckingham Palace described him as 'comfortable and in good spirits' following the exploratory operation on his abdomen.

Her arrival marked Philip's 92nd birthday, celebrated today, and he was also visited separately by his son the Earl of Wessex this afternoon.

The Queen was pictured holding a birthday card as she was greeted by hospital staff this evening.

The envelope was addressed to HRH The Duke Of Edinburgh.

The Duke is progressing well following his operation on Friday.

Once out of hospital will 
spend two months convalescing, said the Palace.

The Queen arrived shortly before 7pm at the London Clinic where her husband is being treated.

In a short statement the Palace said:
 'His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh is progressing according to 
plans at this early stage. He is comfortable and in good spirits.

'He will remain in hospital for up to
 two weeks, and it is expected he will then be taking a period of 
convalescence of approximately two months.'

The Palace confirmed the Prince is due to resume public engagements in the autumn.

The Queen left at about 7.30pm after a half an hour visit.

Prince Edward was the first member of the Royal Family to visit the Duke and said he was doing 'well' after his visit.

His visit lasted 20 minutes and as he left he was asked by the waiting press how his father was and replied: 'Well, thank you'.

The Duke has already received the 
good wishes of the Prime Minister on his birthday and gun salutes have 
been fired across the UK to mark the milestone.

David Cameron took to Twitter to send
 a birthday message to Philip: 'Wishing the Duke of Edinburgh a very 
happy 92nd birthday as he recovers in hospital today.'

Welcome party: A member of staff greeted the Earl as he stepped from the vehicle and she curtseyed to the royal before walking into the building with him

Prince Edward arrived at the central London hospital in a Land Rover Discovery shortly after 3.30pm.

A member of staff greeted the Earl as he stepped from the vehicle and 
she curtseyed to the royal before walking into the building with him.

The
 police presence around the hospital increased ahead of Edward's arrival
 and broadcasters and photographers sprung into action to capture the 
moment. 

Following the Duke's operation on 
Friday, Buckingham Palace said he was 'progressing satisfactorily' and 
was 'comfortable', but has not released any further updates.

Edward's visit indicates the Duke is well enough to see callers but he did not stay long, leaving after 20 minutes.

Prince Philip had been too tired to accept visits but the Queen's arrival is a good sign of his recovery.

Prince Charles and 
Camilla were at Birkhall, their private residence at Balmoral.

'Doing well': The Duke was admitted to the London Clinic for the pre-arranged operation on Thursday evening, following a garden party at the Palace that day

Gun salutes were fired today to mark his birthday.

The King’s Troop Royal Horse Artillery fired a 41-gun royal salute at noon to mark Philip’s birthday.

The
 Palace has not revealed what prompted the exploratory surgery but 
sources said doctors ‘picked something up’ during a routine health 
check.

The Duke was then admitted to the London 
Clinic ahead of Friday's pre-arranged operation on Thursday night, following a garden 
party at the Palace that day.

The surgery, known as a laparotomy, 
was performed on Friday under general anaesthetic.

He was visited by the royal doctor, Professor
 John Cunningham, on Saturday and the results of the operation are 
expected later this week.

The Duke has yet to receive a visit from the Queen at the London Clinic where he had an abdominal operation

The Duke is likely to remain in hospital for up to two weeks in total 
while he recovers.

Royal-watchers said it was not unusual
 for members of the Royal Family not to visit the duke in hospital, 
because he disliked ‘fuss’.

The duke’s latest admission is the fourth time in 18 months that he has needed hospital treatment.

In
 2008 he was admitted for four days with a chest infection but refused 
to receive any well-wishers, instead catching up on his paperwork.

His
 eldest grandson Peter Phillips said last week that the family was kept 
informed but added: ‘He’s one of those people who wouldn’t want you to 
stop just because he’s gone into hospital.’

The Queen has continued with her royal engagements and visited the BBC Broadcasting House on Friday

Last August he was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary to be treated for a recurrence of a bladder infection while staying with the Queen at Balmoral.

He was in hospital for six days and was not visited by any members of the Royal Family, following doctors’ orders for the elderly Duke to rest.

Two months earlier he spent five days convalescing at London’s Edward VII hospital after being taken ill following the Diamond Jubilee pageant along the River Thames.

And in 2011 he spent Christmas in hospital after he was rushed to Papworth Hospital in Cambridge with chest pains on December 23. He underwent an operation to clear a blocked artery.
