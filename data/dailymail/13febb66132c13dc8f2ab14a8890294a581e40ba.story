Top seed Serena Williams overcame another slow start - and a coughing fit - to beat Garbine Muguruza in three sets and gain a measure of revenge for her defeat at the hands of the 24th seed in the second round of the French Open.

Muguruza won 6-2, 6-2 at Roland Garros last year and threatened to do the same on Rod Laver Arena as she won four games in a row from 2-2 in the opening set.

Williams, who had to save three set points against Vera Zvonareva in round two and then came from a set down to defeat Elina Svitolina, won the second set 6-3 to level the match and then crucially held serve at the start of the decider.

Williams was a set down and on the verge of going out before she fought back to progress 

Muguruza got off to a good start but was unable to see the match out

The world No 1 had to save six break points in an epic game lasting 13 minutes and then immediately broke a disheartened opponent on her way to taking the set by a flattering 6-2 scoreline.

Williams then thanked a spectator for some valuable advice in an on-court interview, adding: 'She (Muguruza) played so well and she did everything she needed to do in the first set.

Williams was backed by the crowd on the Rod Laver Arena and thanked them at the end for their support

'I just decided to do my best and stay focused and stay relaxed. She hits the ball really, really big and hard, but someone in the crowd was like 'Use spin'. I was like 'Okay' and it really helped me.'

Williams struggled with a cough during the match and the interview, the 33-year-old admitting she had been 'a little sick the past couple of days'.
