Her Majesty, who is currently on holiday in Scotland, attended a local service close to Balmoral at Crathie Kirk in Aberdeenshire.

Meanwhile the Duke of Edinburgh went to a service of commemoration at Sandringham Church, near King’s Lynn in Norfolk.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were representing the Queen in Belgium at commemorations of 100 years since Britain's entry into the war.

The monarch has taken a low-key role in the commemorations, as others take the lead at home and abroad in contrast to June's D-Day anniversary.

Then, she took centre stage, appearing at a ceremony with President Barack Obama and President Hollande of France at Sword Beach in France.

The Queen is currently on her traditional summer break at Balmoral Castle and had earlier met a fellow female ruler at an agricultural show.

But unfortunately for the apiarists, the
 monarch looked less than impressed with the miniscule queen bees, 
apparently preferring the cattle instead.

The Queen has a link with the conflict as her uncle Captain Fergus Bowes-Lyon was killed in the Battle of Loos in 1915, which preceded the Somme campaign.

The late Queen Elizabeth began a royal
 tradition of having her wedding bouquet left at the grave of the 
Unknown Warrior at Westminster Abbey, when her posy was left there in 
1923 after she married the Duke of York, later George VI.

She laid the bouquet in tribute to Captain Bowes-Lyon (above). The soldier's burial place was only found after her death in 2002.

The family of Prince Charles’s wife 
Camilla suffered the loss of three brothers, who would have been her 
great uncles, in the 1914-18 war including one - Henry Cubbitt - who 
died at the Somme in 1916.

Once inside the parade ring, she met an enormous white bull and enjoyed the experience, beaming broadly as she presented its owner with a silver cup.

A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: 
‘The Prince of Wales and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are 
representing the Queen today in Glasgow and Belgium respectively, at the
 events to mark the centenary of the First World War.

'The Queen is often represented on 
official visits by members of the Royal family - in fact throughout her 
reign, Her Majesty has been supported by members of the Royal family to 
assist her in public duties.'

Meanwhile, the Prince of Wales joined 
Prime Minister David Cameron in a special service at Glasgow Cathedral 
where both men laid wreaths.

Later, the Duchess of Cornwall as 
expected at a service at Westminster Abbey, while the Duke of York will 
be at St Anne's Cathedral in Belfast.

Mr Cameron said people should ‘never fail to cherish’ peace, as he joined a moving twilight ceremony to mark 100 years since Britain joined the First World War.

The Prime Minister joined the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry at the atmospheric occasion at St Symphorien Military Cemetery near Mons, Belgium.

This was part of events across the UK and Belgium to mark the centenary of the start of the Great War.

They were joined by some 500 guests including relatives of those laid to rest at St Symphorien, where 229 Commonwealth and 284 German troops are buried, including the first and last British soldiers to die on the Western Front, and the recipient of the first VC of the war.
