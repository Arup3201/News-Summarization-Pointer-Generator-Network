Mohamed Salah inspired Fiorentina  to a 3-1 win at Sassuolo in Serie A on Saturday to keep alive their chances of qualifying for the Champions League.

Salah, who joined on loan from Chelsea in the deal which took Juan Cuadrado to Stamford Bridge, scored the opener thanks to an assist from Khouma Babacar, who netted Fiorentina's other two goals.

Domenico Berardi, who had earlier hit the post, scored a consolation goal for Sassuolo.

Fiorentina provisionally closed the gap on third-place to four points with Napoli playing at Palermo later and hoping to move to within a point of second-place Roma.

The win will also serve as a timely boost to Fiorentina ahead of Thursday's Europa League round of 32 tie against Tottenham Hotspur.

Sassuolo remained 12th after what was only their second home defeat of the season.

Salah was handed his first start by Vincenzo Montella and the Egypt winger opened his Fiorentina account on the half-hour mark, racing onto Babacar's back-heel flick and firing into the bottom left corner.

He returned the favour two minutes later with a through ball which allowed Babacar to get past Paolo Cannavaro and beat Andrea Consigli from close range.

Berardi almost got Sassuolo back into the match on the stroke of halftime but his curling strike crashed off the left post.

Babacar doubled his tally in the 62nd minute after beating the offside trap to bring down David Pizarro's long ball.

Berardi reduced the deficit five minutes later with a powerful looping header over Fiorentina goalkeeper Ciprian Tatarusanu.
