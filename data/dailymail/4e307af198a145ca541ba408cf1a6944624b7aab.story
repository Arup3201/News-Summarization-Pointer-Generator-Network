A former aide to MP George Galloway has been jailed for possessing a batch of 'explicit' photos of her policeman lover and his estranged wife.

Aisha Ali-Khan, 33, got her hands on the intimate snaps after marrying counter-terror officer Mohammed Azif Khan, 47, in an Islamic ceremony in Pakistan in 2009.

Fearing the photos could be about to be made public, his estranged wife Naheed Khan, who is still legally married to the Met officer, launched a High Court bid to block their disclosure.

Last December, the Watford mother-of-two won a court order, requiring the politician’s former PA to hand over or destroy the embarrassing images.

But Ms Ali-Khan, of Keighley, West Yorkshire, failed to do so and has now been jailed for three months for contempt of court by Judge Richard Seymour.

Ms Ali-Khan, who teaches English at a school in Leeds, worked for Mr Galloway’s Respect party before allegations in 2012 that she slept with Det Insp Khan at the MP's Streatham home.

It resulted in the controversial MP for Bradford West writing an open letter to Home Secretary, Theresa May, demanding an inquiry.

Judge Seymour told the court: 'It appears that Mr Khan, on the occasion of a visit to Pakistan, went through a form of marriage with the defendant.

'As a result, it appears, of each of Mrs Khan and the defendant sharing the affections of Mr Khan, the defendant seems to have come into possession of some confidential photographs and digital images of Mrs Khan.

'Mrs Khan became aware of the position as a result of exchanges between the parties and consequently commenced proceedings against the defendant, seeking damages and various injunctions.'

Faced with the prospect of the spat being revealed in open court, Ms Ali-Khan last December consented to an order under which she promised to get rid of the images.

However, four months later, she had still not shown that she had done so, leading to Naheed Khan’s application to the High Court to commit her to prison.

Outlining the contempt allegation, barrister Andrew Bodnar said: 'An order has been made. It was not only made, but agreed to by the defendant. She was well aware of its terms.

'She has had multiple opportunities to comply. She has failed to do so and she has offered no explanation, even today, for her failure to comply.'

He said Mrs Khan, as a mother-of-two, deserved to be able to put the sorry affair behind her in the knowledge that she has won and the photos will not see the light of day.

Representing herself, Ms Ali-Khan complained of having been pressured into consenting to the order last December and said she now wanted to set aside the agreement.

She said she no longer has any photos of Mrs Khan, claiming to have destroyed all copies before she had even signed the consent order.

Giving judgment, Judge Seymour said: 'People in your position, when an application is made to be committed to prison, sometimes belatedly do what they have been ordered to do. You haven’t.

'Sometimes people come to court when assigned to deal with an application for committal to prison and say ‘I’m sorry, I know I haven’t done it, but I will do it now’. You haven’t said that.

'What you had to do as a result of the agreement you entered into was very straight-forward. You understood what you had to do. You simply didn’t do it.

'It is usually a good idea to look contrite when you come to court when it is said you are in contempt of court.

Jailing her, he continued: 'The defendant has decided from a fairly early point after signing the consent order that she was not going to comply.

'In all of the circumstances, I have no alternative but to commit the defendant to prison for a period of three months.'

Ms Ali-Khan, who told the judge she was 'in shock', was led from the court in tears by a female security officer. She was ordered to pay an estimated £10,000 court costs bill.

Mrs Khan declined to comment.
