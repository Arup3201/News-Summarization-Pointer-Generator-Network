The sun unleashed a massive X-class solar flare over the weekend which could result in spectacular auroras on Earth tomorrow.

The solar flare peaked at 5:48pm GMT (1:48 pm EDT) on Saturday March 29 causing a brief radio disturbance while generating a series of coronal mass ejections (CMEs).

CMEs are powerful plasma eruptions near the surface of the sun driven by kinks in the solar magnetic field.

The CMEs will graze Earth tomorrow causing a possible geomagnetic storm that will create auroras.

It is not yet clear where auroras will be seen, but it is thought that people living at higher latitudes will be most likely to spot a light show if one emerges.

Scientists, however, believe it will only deliver a ‘glancing blow’ and will not seriously affect communication systems. 

‘The best-guess forecast calls for minor G1-class storms. High-latitude sky watchers should be alert for auroras,' wrote SpaceWeather.com.

Watch the X-class solar flare in action

Solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost.

Astronauts are not in immediate danger because of the relatively low orbit of this manned mission. They do have to be concerned about cumulative exposure during space walks.

The charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the Earth’s magnetic field.

Very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies.

A positive aspect, from an aesthetic point of view, is that the auroras are enhanced.

Geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents.

As well as blacking out some radio signals for about an hour over the weekend, the solar flare produced radio signals of its own, according to SpaceWeather.com.

‘The explosion above sunspot AR2017 sent shock waves racing through the Sun's atmosphere at speeds as high as 11 million mph (4800 km/s),’ it said.

‘Radio emissions stimulated by those shocks crossed the 93 million mile divide to Earth, causing shortwave radio receivers to roar with static.’

Sunspot AR2017, that contained the flare, was active over the weekend, producing three solar flares in total.

In addition to the X-class solar flare on March 29, two M-class solar flares erupted from the region on March 28 and March 30.

Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation. Harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth's atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground.

However -- when intense enough -- they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel.

This flare is classified as an X.1-class flare. X-class denotes the most intense flares, while the number provides more information about its strength. An X2 is twice as intense as an X1, an X3 is three times as intense.

 A solar flare occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atmosphere is suddenly released.

Radiation
 is emitted across virtually the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from 
radio waves at the long wavelength end, through optical emission to 
x-rays and gamma rays at the short wavelength end.

The amount of energy released is the equivalent of millions of 100-megaton hydrogen bombs exploding at the same time

A
 flare occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar 
atmosphere is suddenly released - mostly in the active regions around 
sunspots.

Their frequency varies from several a day, when the sun is particularly active, to less than one a week during quiet periods.

Earlier this week scientists came a step closer to 
understanding this powerful phenomenon behind solar flares  by witnessing, for the first 
time, the mechanism behind it.

Footage
 put together by an international team led by University of Cambridge 
researchers showed entangled magnetic field lines looping from the sun’s 
surface.

These magnetic lines slip around each other and lead to an eruption 35 times the size of the Earth and an explosive release of magnetic energy into space.

The discoveries of a gigantic energy build-up bring scientists a step closer to predicting when and where large flares will occur.

‘We care about this as during flares 
we can have CMEs and sometimes they are sent in our direction,’ said 
lead author, Dr Jaroslav Dudik from Cambridge University.

‘Human civilisation is nowadays maintained by technology and that technology is vulnerable to space weather.'

‘Indeed, coronal mass ejections can damage satellites and therefore have an enormous financial cost.’

‘They
 can also threaten airlines by disturbing the Earth’s magnetic field. 
Very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and 
knock out energy supplies.’
