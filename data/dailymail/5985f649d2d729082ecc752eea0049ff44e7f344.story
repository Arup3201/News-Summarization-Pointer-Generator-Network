Christopher Hines-Randle, 54, from West Cornwall, who has been sentenced to 12 years imprisonment at Truro Crown court for having a home made bomb he planned to use to distract police while he made his way through a 'kill list'

A spurned husband, who planned to kill his wife and mother-in-law 'slowly and painfully' after diverting and distracting the police with a series of homemade bomb blasts, has today been jailed for 12 years.

Christopher Hines-Randle, 54, from Cornwall made a 'hit-list' following the downfall of his marriage, which in addition to his former spouse and her mother also included a psychiatrist, a social worker and a GP.

Hines-Randle, a former tin miner, had experience with explosives and gathered the bomb components over time and had planned to set them off as a decoy for the police while he carried out the murders.

He had told a friend that he wanted to inflict a 'slow and painful death' on his ex-wife Sharon, her mother Sandra Martin, and the other targets on his kill list while the police were distracted.

His plan was foiled when the friend told the police, who found him in his car with a biscuit tin full of bomb parts.

While he had been collecting parts to build the explosives, Judge Christopher Harvey Clark QC dismissed claims that Hines-Randle was a 'mere fantasist' who was unable to build a real bomb.

At Truro Crown Court, he said: 'You are a resourceful man who in my judgement would have been able sooner or later to complete the finished article.'

Philip Lee, prosecuting, said Hines-Randle, a father-of-two, had been bitter and angry after his marriage broke down and had taken to sleeping rough in his car.

His resentment was directed towards his ex-wife and mother of their two children, her mother, Dr Jon Doe, a Cornwall-based child psychiatrist, and social worker Debbie Tully, who had been involved with the family.

Police started investigating Hines-Randle when his friend Adrian Richards warned them about his deteriorating state of mind.

A Royal Navy bomb disposal team had to deploy a robot to investigate the suspicious package at the Truro Business Park where Hines-Randle's car was found, along with a biscuit tin full of bomb components

Mr Richards told officers that over the course of several conversations Hines-Randle asked him for cooling packs from first aid kits at his workplace.

Mr Lee said: 'During their conversation the defendant asked again about the cool packs. When asked why he said they were for making an explosive device.'

Mr Lee said Hines-Randle had some knowledge of explosives from when he worked at the South Crofty Mine in Cornwall.

He added: 'He went on to tell Mr Richards that he intended to use the explosives to create a diversion in Truro and Penzance in order to divert police attention to these areas and away from St Austell.

'When Mr Richards asked who was in his hit list, he said there were six people and named four of them as his wife Sharon, her mother, Dr Doe and Debbie Tully.

'He said that he had followed Dr Doe home and knew where he lived and that he had followed Debbie Tully but hadn’t yet found her home.

Hines-Randle was arrested on the scene, and later plead guilty to the murderous plot to kill his ex-wife, mother-in-law, and two others 'slowly and painfully'

'When asked: ‘You’re not thinking of doing the kids are you?’, he did not reply.'

When questioned about what he intended to do to his victims, Mr Lee said Hines-Randle said that Debbie Tully, his ex-wife and her mother were all going to have a 'slow and painful death because they have made me suffer for two years'.

The court heard that following the warnings from Mr Richards police found Hines-Randle sleeping in his car and arrested him in the early hours of 6.25am of June 21 last year.

Officers found a biscuit tin in the passenger seat footwell which contained items. including gunpowder, which they believed could be used for a bomb.

Police sealed off Threemilestone Industrial Estate in Truro and bomb disposal specialist officers attended the scene to make sure the items were safe for examination.

Royal Navy officers were also called to the scene where they deployed a remote control bomb disposal robot in order to safely examine the area.

Hines-Randle pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to charges of making threats to kill, having an explosive device with intent to endanger life and having an explosive substance under suspicious circumstances.

Emergency services waited at the scene where the suspicious package was found at the Truro Business Park. Hines-Randle had always intended to build the bomb in order to distract the police for long enough to carry out murders, but the judge claimed he was a 'mere fantasist' who was unable to build a real bomb

Jeremy Leaning, defending, claimed his threats were a fantasy and that the items found in his car proved that he had not made a viable device.

He said: 'This was a plan he firmly maintains he would not have carried through.'

Judge Clark jailed Hines-Randle and gave him a restraining order which says he is not to contact his ex-wife, her mother, Dr Doe, Ms Tully, his two children or Mr Richards.

Detective Constable Andy Whittle, senior investigating officer, said afterwards: 'Hines-Randle was a very dangerous man and if his plans had been allowed to continue, people’s lives would have been put at serious risk.

'The victims involved in this case have had the stress and fear of Hines-Randle hanging over them for several months, especially his ex-wife and mother-in-law who have had to live with his threats for some considerable time.

'I hope that the substantial prison sentence that has been passed by the judge today gives them some comfort and allows them to get on with their lives.'
