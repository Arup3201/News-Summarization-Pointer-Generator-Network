Microsoft has been forced to delete seven sarcastic videos mocking Apple's latest range of iPhones.

In a series of spoofs titled 'A fly on the wall in Cupertino?', two actors make ludicrous and dumb suggestions to a man supposed to be Apple CEO Tim Cook in the firm's Californian headquarters.

Their list of pretentious colours, including 'vermillion', 'chartreuse', and 'robins egg', is a dig at the new range of multi-coloured iPhones - and Apple's notoriously 'trendy' image.

In poor taste: Microsoft deleted the advert that mocked Apple

Apple chief executive Tim Cook praises the new iPhone 5S as the most refined model ever made

Colours aside, they took aim at every element of the controversial new design, including the fingerprint reader and megapixel camera.

At one point, the actress hands a piece of A4 paper to 'T' (Tim Cook): 'Feel how light that is. You know how we did that? Megapixels - got them down to eight.'

Picking apart Mr Cook's speech at the launch on Wednesday, the actors make fun of phrases such as 'the gold standard' and 'unapologetically plastic'.

But after an onslaught of criticism, the rival phone company conceded to remove the clips.

A statement released by Microsoft said: 'The video was intended to be a light-hearted poke at our friends from Cupertino. But it was off the mark, and we’ve decided to pull it down.'

Tech bloggers have rushed to berate the videos, which feature a Steve Jobs lookalike as Tim Cook.

Writing for The Next Web, Ken Yeung said: 'Poking fun at Apple’s various colors is perhaps Microsoft’s way of saying, “hey, we thought of this first”, but it’s just comes across as bewildering.'

One commenter on Twitter said: 'These Microsoft ads aren’t funny or entertaining at all, I don’t get it.'

Another tweeted: 'Pathetic AND offensive?'

One video went viral before Microsoft managed to delete it.

It opens with one of the colour-coordinated 'ideas people' poking fun at the iWatch, which is still yet to hit the market after numerous mentions.

The actor says: 'Sorry we're late. My iWatch had to go back to R&D [research and development].'

He proceeds to suggest random colours, with a flourish of his wrist, for the CEO to think about - while his colleague 'translates' them into layman's terms:

'Vermillion, do you feel me?' 'Pink.'

'Chartreuse' 'Green.'

'Robin's egg blue' 'Blue.'

The actress also translates 'yeah bro' to 'yes', and 'nah brah' to 'no'.

He continues to mock how the model falls short of its description: 'You asked us to make the gold standard of iPhone. It turns out that is super hard.

'We made you an iPhone which is the colour gold'.

In what was classed as a 'make or 
break' event for Apple, the tech firm unveiled a cut-price handset 
called the iPhone 5C as well as a high-end model called iPhone 5S.

The release of the iPhone 5C marks a step away from Apple's luxe image.

Many
 believe the move is a desperate bid to poach Samsung buyers, as the 
Korean company and its plastic, cheaper handsets go from strength to 
strength.
