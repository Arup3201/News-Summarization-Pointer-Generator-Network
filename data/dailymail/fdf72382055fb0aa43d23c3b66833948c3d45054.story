A pub holding a competition to find the ‘Ugliest Woman’ got a visit from the police after someone reported them for sexism.

An unknown complainant demanded the competition be cancelled and wanted the owners of Islay Inn prosecuted.

However, when police arrived at the Glasgow venue they gave manager George Hogg the go ahead after discovering it was, in fact, a competition for men dressed as women.

Mr Hogg told of his disbelief of the complaint and accused the protestor of being ‘over the top with political correctness.’

He said: ‘I have no idea who made the complaint and the police wouldn’t tell me - but if he or she had bothered to read the advert properly, they would have realised that it was not ugly women we were looking for - but ugly men dressed up as women.

‘The first we knew of a potential problem was when two female officers from Maryhill Police Station came into the bar on Thursday night.

‘They told me they had received a complaint about us holding a competition to find the ugliest woman in the bar and that it might constitute some kind of sexist offence.

‘But when I pointed out the facts, the policewomen were clearly amused and quickly told me the matter would go no further.'

Mr Hogg added: 'It was a totally over the top reaction by whoever went to the bother of reporting us - political correctness gone mad!’

The event was advertised on the Facebook page of the pub, located in the city’s Kelvingrove area.

Earlier today the page was updated to clear up the 'misunderstanding' regarding the 'Ugliest Woman' competition, which is set to go ahead on Sunday.

The Islay Inn apologised for causing any offense adding: ‘Just so it’s clear to all, our ugly women will be men dressed as women, beard stubble and all.’

The pub offers a £50 cash prize for the ugliest ‘woman’ and in the spirit of equality, the ‘bonniest’ woman dressed as a man will receive a bottle of vodka.

The posting attracted several comments from customers, saying a competition for ugly men would not have been met with the same reaction.

Andrew Parr wrote: ‘Ridiculous getting the police involved. Some people are pathetic.

Mark McCarrick added: ‘As if our overstretched police service haven’t got enough to do without being bothered by some silly complaint.

‘I bet the silly fart wouldn’t have moaned had it been an ugly man competition.

‘Get yourself a life whoever you are, its a bit of fun in these dark and gloomy times!’

Jennifer Forde said: ‘Goodness! Some people get offended very easily - sounds like a good laugh.’

Randi Carlson posted: ‘Well, I did think it was maybe a bit un-PC - but calling the police? That is a bit much.’

Gordon Gillies joked: ‘I bet it was a right ugly one who contacted the police.’

Although the competition has been allowed to take place, Strathclyde Police confirmed to the MailOnline that an inquiry into the complaint is still ongoing.
