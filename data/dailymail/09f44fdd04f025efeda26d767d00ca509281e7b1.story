She's been keeping a pretty low profile since the end of the X Factor in December. 

But yesterday, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini took to Instagram to make a special announcement: she'd had a hair cut. 

Debuting a new bob Cheryl said: '#newdo colour is @lorealparisuk Casting Creme Gloss Berry Red 565. @percyhair thanks for the chop.'

Loving her look: Cheryl posted a picture of her new hair this morning telling her Instagram fans that she is still getting used to her new look

Cheryl said her new style was inspired by a bygone era with the star saying: 'I love the 70s,' she also remarked that the cut was, 'long overdue.' 

This morning a natural and fresh faced looking Cheryl posted a second picture of her new look with the caption: 'Morning people .. Getting to grips with my new "do". 

The chop comes after Cheryl spent months with long hair extensions. Whilst on the X Factor she had them highlighted before swapping for a darker look once the show ended. 

Her hairdresser, Percy Reed, who created the new look for the singer, and whose products are available on QVC said: 'Creating a new look has been talked about for a while but this cut was just done on the spur of the moment. 

'We were backstage in Cheryl's dressing room and we both knew the look we wanted to create, and so, an hour and a half later Cheryl had a completely new look. 

'I wanted to give Cheryl a cut that was feminine and sexy and almost an easy, 'ready to go' cut, that daily can just fall into place.

Percy, who says his Wonderbalm is great for using on wet hair before styling, continued: 'The cut is subtly graduated with a shaggier texture. It's got a slight 70's, Joan Jett texture that keeps it cool. 

'What I really like about this style is that it's so wearable and easy to maintain - it looks amazing after it's just been styled but then it also looks great the following day when it's slightly lived in and undone. Cheryl has great hair, so it's always a pleasure to cut'

This isn't the first time the L'Oreal model has gone for a drastic hair-over. In the 13 years since she first shot to fame on the ITV show Pop Idol, she's tried out many different styles.

She started out with glossy short black hair, has had bright highlights, long extensions and after famously being ditched from the US X Factor she came back with a brand new blonde bob. 

Cheryl, who is married to French entrepreneur Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini, has previously described why she likes changing her hair so much. 

She once said: 'A different hair colour gives you a boost. It makes you feel new and different.'   

Here we look back over her hair-volution...  

Heading to a court appearance in 2003 Cheryl looks barely recognisable as the glamour puss she is today

Crazy cornrows: Performing on stage in 2003 Cheryl thought it would be a good idea to get cornrows 

Supporting her man: Not long after she started dating Ashley Cole in 2004 Cheryl was spotted at an Arsenal match with this choppy blonde do that looked as though it had been inspired by Jennifer Aniston's 'Rachel' cut

By 2006 Cheryl had toned down her highlights and was rocking a half up, half down hairdo

Young and in love: Ashley Cole, Cheryl's first husband, seemed to like her blonde hair which she pulled back from her face with a little red clip 

Fancy fringe: In 2007 Cheryl decided to go for the chop again, this time going for a blunt fringe - unfortunately though, her new look did not distract from her see-through top 

Headband times: Pictured with her Girls Aloud band-mates in 2007 (L-R) Sarah Harding, Nadine Coyle, Nicola Roberts and Kimberley Walsh, Cheryl accessorised her fringe with a coloured hairband

Getting Glam: By 2008 Cheryl was getting more and more glamorous, swapping her bangs for a softer look and adding some high-lights

Ravishing in red: As a wax work of Cheryl was unveiled at Madame Tussauds in 2010 the singer showed off a berry coloured red hair do 

The X Factor disaster: In 2011 Cheryl was hired as a judge on the US X Factor, only to be dumped by Simon Cowell a few weeks later, at the time fans said she looked 'unrecognisable' with this giant do

Birthday girl: After going into hiding following her X Factor nightmare Cheryl stepped out for her 28th birthday a new woman with a new haircut, rocking a super blonde bob

Big bouffant: When she didn't feel like wearing the bob down Cheryl pulled it up into a giant beehive, like when she attended a Stylist Pick party at Home House in September 2011

Cheryl loved this look so much that she kept it for a few months, wearing it both straight and tousled

Back to black: By June 2012 as Cheryl promoted her new album, A Million Lights, she was back to her long hair having dyed her locks considerably darker 

The Fishtail: Cheryl famously loved wearing her hair in a fishtail plait prompting many others to try out her look

As Cheryl was spotted leaving Radio 1 in October 2012 it was slightly lighter hair and an injured arm

She's back! Not only did March 2014 signal the announcement that Cheryl was coming back to the UK X Factor it also gave her a chance to show off this long blonde look

Keeping it curly: Whilst filming the X Factor auditions in August 2014 Cheryl chose to wear her high-lighted hair in soft curls which framed her face
