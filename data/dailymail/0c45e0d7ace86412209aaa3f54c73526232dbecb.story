The international row over Alex Salmond’s praise for Vladimir Putin intensified last night as the Kremlin backed the SNP leader and Ukrainian families in Scotland spoke of their ‘hurt, disgust and betrayal’.

In Moscow, the Russian president's powerful press secretary Dmitry Peskov told the Mail that he ‘agrees with the viewpoint of the Scottish First Minister’.

Mr Peskov – seen as the Alastair Campbell of the Kremlin – spoke out as Russian newspapers poured praise on the SNP leader, threating to further damage Scotland’s international reputation.

Vladimir Putin's top spin doctor has backed Alex Salmond's praise for the Russian President which has sparked a global row

In Scotland, Ukrainians demanded an ‘unequivocal public apology’ from the First Minister. Michael Ostapko, Scottish chairman of the Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain, has written to Mr Salmond to condemn his ‘crass words’.

In the Commons today, Labour MP Shelia Gilmore said Ukrainians had expressed Salmond 'disgust and astonishment' at remarks supporting a regime 'which oppresses its own minority groups and silences its critics'.

Prime Minister David Cameron said he 'wholeheartedly' agreed with her, adding: 'I think what Alex Salmond said was a major error of judgement.

'I think all of us in this House should be supporting the Ukrainian desire to be a sovereign, independent country and to have the respect of the international community and party leaders for that ambition.'

The First Minister yesterday failed to apologise and claimed he was referring to the recent Sochi Winter Olympic Games when he said he admires Putin for restoring ‘a substantial part of Russian pride’.

The row was triggered by an interview with former Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell for the latest edition of GQ magazine, which took place on March 14. Just days earlier, 80,000 Russian troops had amassed on Ukraine’s borders and the Crimea region of the country was annexed on March 18.

In the interview, Mr Campbell asked about the Russian president, to which Mr Salmond replied: ‘Well, obviously, I don’t approve of a range of Russian actions, but I think Putin’s more effective than the press he gets I would have thought, and you can see why he carries support in Russia.’

Pressed on whether he admires Putin, 
the First Minister added: ‘Certain aspects. He’s restored a substantial 
part of Russian pride and that must be a good thing.’

Yesterday, Mr Ostapko said he has been ‘overwhelmed’ by the reaction of Ukrainians to Mr Salmond’s comments.

‘They
 are variously insulted, dismayed and upset that a high-profile 
politician aspiring to some favoured position in the history of these 
freedom loving isles should make poorly considered, erroneous and 
mistaken assessments and to express admiration of a dictatorial and 
criminal regime,’ he said.

‘Even worse are the lame excuses given by his spokespersons over dates and events having already taken place in Crimea.

The facts are that occupation of the Crimean parliament took place at the end of February followed by the unconstitutional illegal ‘referendum’ on March 16, organised by a government which had been taken over at gunpoint by a party that gained only 4 per cent of the vote in the 2012 election, and supported by Russian soldiers and gangs of men equipped and armed by Russia.’

He added: ‘Mr Salmond’s words can only give succour to the perpetrator of such undemocratic action. Mr Salmond has to think before he speaks and he owes us a sincere apology.’

In his letter to the First Minister, Mr Ostapko wrote: ‘The overwhelming comments are of hurt, disgust, betrayal and astonishment that any importantly placed person should have allowed themselves to apparently succumb to vanity and thoughtlessness, particularly to the sensitivities of Ukrainians worldwide, let alone those living in Scotland.’

But in Russia, there was apparent delight yesterday that a Western politician had given qualified support to Putin.

A writer for the Sobesednik newspaper, Nikita Smagin, said: ‘Isn't it nice when you are admired? 

‘And when you are admired by heroes on the other side of the barricade, it's a double pleasure. The First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond has such feelings for the Russian President Vladimir Putin. And the love of the Celt is really worth it.’

Foreign Secretary William Hague and leading politicians from all main parties have condemned Mr Salmond’s remarks.

Writing in today’s Scottish Daily Mail, Labour MP Gemma Doyle – who visited Ukraine with a cross-party Westminster delegation earlier this month – said: ‘His words are not fitting of the First Minister of Scotland, and I know that many people in Scotland would agree with many of those whom I met in Ukraine, that Putin is not a man to be admired. And it is clear, that when it comes to this, neither is Mr Salmond.’

Kerry pledged yesterday that NATO partners - including those that border Ukraine or Russia - would be defended to the hilt if their sovereignty is threatened

But the First Minister said yesterday: ‘Often Putin has been displayed as a figure of fun – somebody who wrestles with bears.

‘Actually, I think that’s a severe under-estimation of Putin and therefore to portray him in that light is wrong.

‘In terms of what I said about Russian pride, and what I was thinking of, was the Sochi Games.’

A spokesman for Mr Salmond added: ‘The First Minister will reply directly to [Mr Ostapko’s] letter making clear, as he did in the GQ interview, that he disapproves ‘of a range of Russian actions’. The Scottish Government is entirely opposed to the Russian Government’s stance on human rights, homosexuality and indeed the illegal annexation of Crimea.

‘Since this interview was conducted the Scottish Government has made our position abundantly clear on the illegal annexation, including the decision to withdraw the invitation to the Russian Consul General to the annual Scottish Consular Corps dinner.’
