Wales host England at the Millennium Stadium on Friday night in what is sure to be a thrilling start to the Six Nations.

Here, Sportsmail's NIK SIMON looks at the form of each player ahead of the crunch clash.

FULL BACK 

WALES 

Leigh Halfpenny 7.5

Age: 26 Caps: 55

Found his rhythm again after an injury-plagued start to life in Toulon. A wonderful goal-kicker and a key defensive pin.

ENGLAND

Mike Brown 7

Age: 29 Caps: 33

Claims to have cut out the ‘flashy stuff’ to create more opportunities for team-mates. Form has dropped since last year's competition

WING

WALES 

Alex Cuthbert 7

Age: 24 Caps: 30

Unsettled at club level and turned down a dual contract with the Welsh Rugby Union. However, his scoring record in the Test arena remains impressive. 

ENGLAND

Anthony Watson 7

Age: 20 Caps: 4

An exciting attacker for Bath but still waiting for his first international try. His speed can cause problems if used effectively.

Anthony Watson's speed can cause the Welsh defence problems but has yet to score in a competitive fixture

CENTRE

WALES

Jonathan Davies 8

Age: 26 Caps: 43

Has a seamless midfield partnership with Jamie Roberts. Dangerous with ball-in-hand and bounced off tackles by Brad Barritt in the Champions Cup last month.

ENGLAND

Jonathan Joseph 7.5

Age: 23 Caps: 6

Very different style to Manu Tuilagi, who would be starting if fit. Adds some magic with his footwork and intelligent running lines.

CENTRE

WALES

Jamie Roberts 8

Age: 28 Caps: 64

A classy and intelligent operator who will carry hard or run as a decoy. Gets his side on the front foot and is also the team’s defensive captain.

ENGLAND

Luther Burrell 6.5

Age: 27 Caps: 7

Shown up by Jamie Roberts in the Champions Cup last month. Injuries have stunted the Saints midfielder’s form this season.

WING

WALES

George North 7.5

Age: 22 Caps: 45

Unquestionably one of the most gifted wingers in the northern hemisphere, although his form for Wales has been questioned.

ENGLAND

Jonny May 7

Age: 24 Caps: 11

Often unpredictable but will need to stick to patterns to avoid being exploited by the Welsh back-three. Uncatchable in space.

George North storms past the challenge of Jack Nowell during the match at Twickenham last year

Jonny May is uncatchable in space and will be looking to impress on Friday night

FLY-HALF

WALES 

Dan Biggar 8

Age: 25 Caps: 28

Established himself as the chief incumbent of the No 10 jersey in the autumn. A brave outside-half who has the confidence to rally those around him.

ENGLAND

George Ford 7.5

Age: 21 Caps: 6

Would have been favourite to start even if Owen Farrell was fit. His small stature will be targeted by Wales’s physical runners.

SCRUM-HALF

WALES

Rhys Webb 8

Age: 26 Caps: 9

A livewire player who injects speed. His sniping runs are a constant threat around the fringes of the breakdown. Prone to mistakes.

ENGLAND

Ben Youngs 7

Age: 25 Caps: 42

Has the speed required for a modern scrum-half. Offers a more reliable kicking game than Danny Care. Sometimes anonymous for England.

PROP

WALES

Gethin Jenkins 7.5

Age: 34 Caps: 110

Dropped at the start of the autumn but returned with a mighty performance against South Africa. Experienced scrummager who acts as an extra back-row.

ENGLAND

Dan Cole 6.5

Age: 27 Caps: 45

A world-class scrummager who is equally combative at the breakdown. A lack of game time because of injuries could be problematic.

HOOKER

WALES

Richard Hibbard 7

Age: 31 Caps: 33

Back in the line-up after a club v country row in the autumn. A fiery individual who can lift the team with a crunching tackle or carry.

ENGLAND

Dylan Hartley 7.5

Age: 28 Caps: 61

If he can rise above the Welsh wind-ups, Hartley can be one of England’s most influential players. Must keep his cool and cut down the penalties.

PROP

WALES

Samson Lee 8

Age: 22 Caps: 9

Took the sting out of Adam Jones’s retirement. Stocky and solid in the scrum, making him Europe’s up-and-coming tight-head.

ENGLAND

Joe Marler 8

Age: 24 Caps: 26

The Quins skipper had a torrid time against Wales two years ago but his game has come on leaps and bounds.

Joe Marler has come on leaps and bounds and will face up to young Welshman Samson Lee

SECOND ROW

WALES

Jake Ball 7.5

Age: 23 Caps: 8

Established himself as a starting second row with his powerful performances in the autumn. Strong and physical with soft hands from his cricketing background.

ENGLAND

Dave Attwood 8

Age: 27 Caps: 16

Playing the best rugby of his career following a second wind at Bath. Physical and intelligent player who will make his presence known.

SECOND ROW

WALES

Alun Wyn Jones 8

Age: 29 Caps: 84

An abrasive character who will get in the face of the opposition. Expect him to try and get under the inexperienced skin of George Kruis.

ENGLAND

George Kruis 7

Age: 24 Caps: 4

His inexperience will be targeted by some of Wales’s veterans. Has been selected amid major second-row injury problems.

BLINDSIDE

WALES

Dan Lydiate 7.5

Age: 27 Caps: 41

The menacing chop tackler who will be diving at the ankles of Billy Vunipola. Back up to speed after having his Racing Metro contract terminated.

ENGLAND

James Haskell 8

Age: 29 Caps: 53

Eager to seize his opportunity back in the international set-up. The form player for Wasps who will carry hard and tackle until he drops.

NO. 8

WALES

Toby Faletau 7

Age: 24 Caps: 40

Played every minute of the autumn and offers athleticism as a ball carrier. A lack of challengers for his jersey.

ENGLAND

Billy Vunipola 7.5

Age: 22 Caps: 12

Flopped for England during the autumn but rediscovered his form at Saracens with some barnstorming carrying.

There are a lack of challengers for Toby Faletau's (l) jersey while Billy Vunipola needs to improve for England

OPENSIDE

WALES

Sam Warburton 8

Age: 26 Caps: 49

A menace at the breakdown and the heartbeat of the team. According to coach Rob Howley, Wales play well when Warburton plays well.

ENGLAND

Chris Robshaw 7.5

Age: 28 Caps: 32

Described by his opposite number as England’s most consistent performer. Commitment to the cause is never questioned.

Sam Warburton and Chris Robshaw - the two captains ready to go head-to-head on Friday night

WALES SUBSTITUTES: Scott Baldwin, Paul James, Aaron Jarvis, Luke Charteris, Justin Tipuric, Mike Phillips, Rhys Priestland, Liam Williams

ENGLAND SUBSTITUTES: Tom Youngs, Mako Vunipola, Kieran Brookes, Tom Croft, Nick Easter, Richard Wigglesworth, Danny Cipriani, Billy Twelvetrees 

WALES TOTAL: 114.5

Average score: 7.63

Average score: 7.30
