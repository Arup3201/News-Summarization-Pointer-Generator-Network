This plastic water bottle is fitted with a Nasa-inspired filtration system so powerful it can turn cola into clear, colourless liquid, the manufacturers claim.

ÖKO's 'advanced filtration water bottle' draws on technology originally developed by Nasa to ensure the drinker's every sip is 'pure, fresh and clean'.

This video footage of the bottle being put to the test shows it being filled with brown Coca Cola which, after being poured through the special filter cap, looks exactly like water.

The manufacturer used a video demonstrating the effect of the filter on cola on its website, but a tester for rocketnews24.com decided to check out the results for himself.

The footage of the experiment shows how his trial using his own ÖKO bottle yielded the same results at first.

'The first streams of liquid were completely colourless, but became tinged with brown as I continued to pour,' his report said.

'I was a little disappointed that it wasn't completely colourless, but pressed on.

'I took a sip and was again disappointed to find that it wasn't tasteless,' said the tester, who added that it tasted 'like sugar water'.

The Coca Cola experiment on the OKO website is aimed at illustrating the effectiveness of the bottle, which is designed to filter water, not other drinks.

The eco-friendly water container comes in three different filtration levels.

The Level-1 filter is carbon based and designed to reduce chlorine and odour from tap water.

Powerful: The filtration system used for the plastic water containers was inspired by Nasa technology

The Level-2 filter contains more than 400 tiny pores and uses a positively charged electro-absorption process to trap harmful agents as water passes through it.

According to the manufacturer, charge fields activated upon contact with water virtually close the pore to any intruding agents. 'Using built-in silver ions, the material then kills bacteria upon contact,' the OKO website says.

The third level of filtration is designed for the treatment of known elements in large volumes of water in extreme environments. Level-3 is not available to buy at retail.
