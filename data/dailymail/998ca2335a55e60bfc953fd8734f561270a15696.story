The Afghan War veteran son of a Canadian MP has posted footage of himself with Kurdish fighters after travelling to Iraq to join their fight against the so-called Islamic State terror group.

Dillon Hillier, 26, whose father Randy is a Progressive Conservative member of the Ontario provincial legislature, is one of around half a dozen Canadian veterans understood to have travelled to the region.

Video posted online by the former professional soldier show him putting his training to good use by bandaging a Kurdish fighter who has been shot in the face during a clash with jihadis.

'Hey take this wrap it around his head,' shouts Mr Hillier at a Peshmerga fighter watching him patching up his comrade, as gunfire rings out in the background. 'Like this, like this!' he tells the fighter.

'F***! He got hit in the face,' says Mr Hillier. 'You're going to be alright man, tell him he's going to be alright!' The video was posted to Facebook with a comment from Mr Hillier calling it the 'greatest day' of his life.

'I accomplished more good in those 20 hours than the previous 26 years of my life,' he said. 'I dragged a man who had been shot in the face to safety and patched him up, while many others stood around in shock.

'I am unsure if my actions saved his life but I truly hope so.'

Mr Hillier travelled to Iraq as part of a group calling itself the 1st North American Expeditionary Force, which is raising a military unit from Canadian and U.S. veterans to fight alongside Kurdish forces in Iraq and Syria.

The group's Facebook page later reported that the man who Mr Hillier helped to patch up did indeed survive his injury.  

'I got put on this Earth to do one thing,' the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation quoted one of the men, who served in Afghanistan, as saying on condition of anonymity. 'I got this fire in me. I still want to soldier on.'

Canadian fighter jets joined U.S.-led air strikes against Islamic State in Iraq in October. The decision to join the campaign was followed by fatal attacks on two soldiers in Canada in October that police said were carried out independently by radical recent converts to Islam.

Ian Bradbury, an organiser at the First North American Expeditionary Force was quoted in the National Post as saying the group provided logistical support to Mr Hillier, who flew to north-east Iraq's Kurdish late last month.

'As long as nobody's being trained here, as long as we're not forming any militia, it's all in bounds,' Mr Bradbury was quoted as saying.

The paper quoted Mr Hillier as saying: 'I look at what I'm doing as no different than when thousands of Canadians went to fight the Germans in World War Two.'

His parents, Randy and Jane Hillier, declined to confirm directly that he was in Iraq, but said in a statement reported by CBC: 'There are no words which can adequately describe how proud we are of our son Dillon, including his past service with the Canadian Armed Forces. While we have limited contact with Dillon, we do know he is safe and sound.'
