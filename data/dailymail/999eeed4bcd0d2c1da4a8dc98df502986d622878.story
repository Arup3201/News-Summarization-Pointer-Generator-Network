Atletico Madrid have relaunched a bid to sign Roberto Soldado from Tottenham but want an initial loan.

The move is likely to be met with a swift rebuttal by Tottenham who would be reluctant to allow the Spain international to leave just a year on from signing him for £26million from Valencia.

Tottenham have interest from QPR in winger Andros Townsend but will not sell the England international for less than £10million.

Meanwhile, PSV Eindhoven are offering a new contract to Tottenham target Memphis Depay. 

The 20-year-old Holland international is the subject of a £15m offer from Tottenham and is interested in the move.

Tottenham's move for Seattle Sounders right-back DeAndre Yedlin, however, may be derailed by his chances of earning a work permit. 

Tottenham want cover for Kyle Walker and are prepared to pay £2.75m for the 21-year-old.
