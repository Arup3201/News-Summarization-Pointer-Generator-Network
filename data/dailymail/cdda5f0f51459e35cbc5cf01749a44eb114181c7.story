Women who are undergoing chemotherapy have started decorating their eyebrows in festive holiday themes, as part of a new social media campaign.

The Younger Breast Cancer Network, a support group for women in the UK aged 45 and under, is behind the new beauty trend, which began on Facebook and Twitter earlier this week using the hashtag #christmaschemobrow.

'Our Christmas gift of laughter to our followers....#christmaschemobrow and #chemobrow The funniest cancer pics ever, spread the ybcn love!' the organisation tweeted on Sunday.

Take a bow: Women who are undergoing chemotherapy have started decorating their eyebrows in festive holiday themes, as part of a new social media campaign

Participants have gotten quite creative, adorning their brows with metallic bows, drawn-on boughs of holly, candy canes and other colourful embellishments.

One woman painted on eyebrows with gold glitter, while another crafted them out of tinsel.

Victoria Yates, who founded the network in 2010, told ABC News that she wanted to cheer up women who had lost their eyebrows due to the effects of chemotherapy.

'Losing eyebrows and lashes is worse than the hair on your head for lots of our members so this was just acknowledging it and using it to make us smile,' she said.

Ms Yates, a lawyer and mother-of-two who survived breast cancer four years ago at the age of 36, began noticing the group's members sharing photos of 'extreme brow drawing' a few months ago, and soon the trend took on a Christmas theme - and gained a wider audience.

'It was a real giggle and lifted our spirits at what is a tricky time for lots of our members. it was so funny and heartwarming that we decided to share it outside of our group too,' Ms Yates said.

All women are encouraged to show their support for those battling breast cancer by donning a whimsical brow decoration.

'Going through chemo and other cancer treatment is hard,' YBCN member Sarah Perry told BuzzFeed. 'You spend so much time ill, stressed out, worried, afraid – maintaining a sense of humour and finding ways to laugh are so important.'

'Christmas can be a difficult time of year for younger women going through treatment like chemotherapy for breast cancer, especially when it is making them ill and preventing them from joining in the festive parties and celebrations,' she added.
