Attorneys for the 19-year-old 'gang member' accused of killing a mother in a spray of gunfire want a judge to let them check the dead woman's body for gunshot residue.

Erich Milton Nowsch Jr. stood shackled in court Thursday while lawyers Augustus Claus and Conrad Claus told a judge they want police, dispatch and coroner records ahead of a scheduled March 10 hearing.

The lawyers also asked for an order for a coroner's office to allow a test on Tammy Meyers' body to determine if she or someone next to her fired a gun before she died.

Erich Nowsch Jr. (pictured in a Las Vegas courtroom on Monday) has been charged with the murder of Tammy Meyers. His attorney wants the victim's body to be tested for gunshot revenue 

Nowsch is jailed without bail on murder, attempted murder and weapon charges.

The 44-year-old Meyers was wounded in the head February 12 and died two days later. Nowsch was arrested on February. 19.

Many questions remain after conflicting accounts from authorities and Meyers' family about what initially was characterized as a road rage attack.

The 19-year-old's defense team hope the request to the coroner's office will be able to determine whether Meyers, 44, or somebody next to her fired a gun before she died

On Tuesday, his lawyers said he was high on marijuana while he was being questioned, and cops knew it.

He surrendered to the authorities after a stand-off in suburban Las Vegas.

Claus said he plans to argue in court that anything Nowsch told investigators after he was taken into custody can no longer be used in the impending murder trial.

It's not clear what Nowsch told detectives after his arrest. 

'People tend to say things that aren't entirely credible when they're under the influence,' he told the Associated Press. 

Claus said 'not only' did the police let Nowsch smoke, they 'watched him do it' as they tried 'to talk him down' during a standoff that involved a helicopter and a SWAT team.

The allegation was just the latest in a string of turns that has plagued what was initially thought to be a 'road rage' murder. 

On Monday, local resident Robert Selig said Meyers, 44, was killed in a 'drug deal gone bad'.

'The son and mother left the Meyers residence looking for Eric on a drug deal gone bad,' he said. 'That's the word on the street. A prescription drug deal gone bad.'

Selig said he believes Meyers went to the park to pick up pharmaceutical pills 'like Xanax' from Erich.

'The kid sold it right there at that concrete table, day in day out,' he said.

Nowsch has been accused of shooting 44-year-old Tammy Meyers dead during an act of road rage. It has since been revealed that the Meyers family knew the suspect 

The Meyers family initially claimed that Meyers had gotten into an argument with Nowsch while giving her daughter a driving lesson on the night of the February 12 shooting.

They said Nowsch followed them home and shot at them.

It has since emerged that Meyers went home and recruited her son Brandon, who brought his

Meyers was shot in the head and died after two days on life-support.

Claus said he believes Nowsch will be able to claim self-defense because Brandon Meyers was armed. 

Last week it was revealed that the Meyers family actually knew Nowsch.
