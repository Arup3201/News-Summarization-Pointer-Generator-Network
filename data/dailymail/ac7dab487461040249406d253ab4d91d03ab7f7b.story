Prosecutors in Montana say a man caught leaving a house he had apparently burglarized apologized to the homeowner and offered him some heroin.

The Billings Gazette reports Christopher Dayell Bittner made an initial court appearance Monday on felony burglary and drug possession charges.

Authorities say the homeowner and his seven-year-old son came home as Bittner was leaving Saturday. 

Yellowstone County Attorney Paul Adam says Bittner apologized and offered the drug. 

Apologetic: Christopher Dayell Bittner - pictured here from a family member's Facebook page - allegedly offered a homeowner in Billings, Montana, some heroin after being caught burglarizing the man's house

He was found nearby, and court records say a search of his backpack turned up 31.5 grams of heroin, seven syriunges, other drug paraphernalia and items belonging to the homeowner.

Bittner allegedly stole a sweatshirt, art box and face cream from the house.

He also reportedly offered to sell the homeowner a guitar he had with him during their counter. 

Public defender Roberta Drew asked that Bittner be released without bail because he wanted to attend his father's funeral. 

Bail was set at $7,500, but Bittner was allowed to attend the service.
