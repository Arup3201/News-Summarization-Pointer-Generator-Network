A man and two children managed to escape with minor scratches after the car they were travelling in split in two. 

The trio had been travelling along the A45 Fletchamstead Highway in Coventry in the West Midlands when the bonnet and front two wheels were ripped from their green Subaru Impreza.

The remaining back portion of the car then came to rest on woodland next to the road and the driver and his two young passengers managed to scramble out, virtually unharmed.

A man and two children managed to scramble free virtually unscathed from the wreckage of their car after it split in two on a highway in Coventry, with the wheels and bonnet ripped from the front of the vehicle 

The entire engine compartment of the car and the front two wheels were left upturned on the road in a mass of mangled metal.

Emergency services were called after the accident on Saturday.

A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said: 'West Midlands Ambulance Service was called to Fletchamstead Highway in Coventry shortly before 11.40am.

'Two ambulance crews and a paramedic area support officer in a rapid response vehicle attended.

'The man and both children got out of the vehicle and, other than a couple of minor scratches, were uninjured.

'Because of the level of damage to the car, all three were taken to University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire for further checks, just as a precaution.'

The road was closed briefly and the cause of the crash is not yet known.
