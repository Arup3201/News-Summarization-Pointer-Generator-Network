Desperate Housewives creator Marc Cherry showed jurors notes in a bid to prove he had already decided to kill of the character of Edie Britt, played by Nicollette Sheridan, before an incident which saw him 'tap' her on the head.

But while the veteran producer has claimed he made the creative decision in May 2008, a former writer on the show contradicted his testimony as she told the court today that it was not until December of that year that she heard the actress's role was being terminated.

Lori Kirkland Baker was a writer on the show's fourth and fifth seasons, but her contract was not renewed after that.

Confident: Nicollette Sheridan arrived at the courthouse looking upbeat in yet another beautiful suit today

It came after Cherry showed the jury 
his writers' notes detailing various scenarios for killing off 
Nicollette Sheridan's character in the months before he and the actress 
argued on the set.

She contends it was a 'wallop,' which led to her being axed from the show after she raised concerns about this mistreatment.

But Cherry produced coded notes that he 
says prove he couldn't have killed off her role in retaliation as they 
outline early plans for her exit and pre-date the incident.

The notes were made by writers while 
crafting plots for the show's fifth season, during which Sheridan's 
character, Edie Britt, died.

In one early example, Cherry told 
jurors the code 'Steven drinks OJ' was a reference to Sheridan's 
on-screen husband killing Britt.

He said it was a reference to O.J. Simpson, who was acquitted of killing his wife.

She wears it well: Sheridan has a different couture suit for her each day, the actress certainly knows how to work a stage

Proof: Marc Cherry was also cheery as he arrived at court today carrying the notes he says prove that he considered many exit strategies, including an OJ Simpson-style murder plot

Inspiration: Cherry said that one scenario was inspired by acquitted murderer O.J, Simpson and the death of his wife Nicole Brown in 1994

Cherry also explained how Sheridan's exit was because she put a negative atmosphere on the set and argued with Teri Hatcher.

The producer said Sheridan told him that Hatcher was the 'meanest woman in the world'

Sheridan is suing Cherry and ABC, 
claiming she was fired from Housewives after complaining that Cherry hit
her during the September 2008 argument.

She is seeking more than $6 million.

Cherry and a former ABC executive, 
Mark Pedowitz, have testified that approval to kill off Sheridan's role 
was given four months before the fight.

Pedowitz testified yesterday that he thought Britt's character had run its course by the fifth season.

Cherry told jurors that he had 
contemplated killing Sheridan's character at the end of season three, 
but studio and network executives didn't approve it.

As he began to plan season five in May
2008, he said he wanted to kill Britt as part of a 'risky but 
potentially effective change to the series.'

He received approval to kill Sheridan's role on May 22, 2008, from two top-ranking executives at ABC.

Sheridan's attorneys have claimed 
Cherry decided to fire Sheridan from the series only after he was 
cleared by ABC executives for striking the actress on set.

More details to come: Sheridan's attorneys have called Cherry as 
the trial's second witness, and he is adamant that he did not axe her in retaliation for any complaint

In opening statements, the actress' 
attorney, Mark Baute, claimed the episode in which Britt dies was poorly
written and was done more haphazardly than if it had been planned for 
months.

Cherry said he never wavered in his 
decision to kill off Sheridan's role, but that he acquiesced to requests
by the executives to wait until later in the season for the on-screen 
killing to occur.

The notes displayed Wednesday showed 
Britt's death was originally slated for mid-season, with several 
episodes dealing with a police investigation.

He said the coded phrase 'Steve drinks
OJ' was necessary to keep the secret from people passing through the 
writers' room where Housewives scripts are contemplated and crafted.

'Mine is a series based on surprise and shock and secrets,' Cherry said.

Britt died in the 18th episode of the
season after surviving a strangulation attempt and a car crash, only to
be electrocuted by a downed power line.

Baute, in opening statements, called it a triple homicide that reflected Cherry's animosity toward Sheridan.

Existing cast members Felicity 
Huffman, Marcia Cross and Eva Longoria are expected to take the stand in
the coming days, they're completing their final season after starring 
in the vehicle since its smash hit inception in 2004.

Battle: Sheridan 
took to the stand on Friday and claimed that Cherry deliberately didn't 
give her character any funny lines

Giving evidence: Court papers show the names of stars from Desperate Housewives who will be called for the defense

Written out: Sheridan's character Edie Britt was killed off in 2009 when her character was electrocuted following a car crash

No research: Potential jurors were told not to watch Desperate 
Housewives at the end of day two in the Nicollette Sheridan versus Marc 
Cherry legal battle

They're more likely to be found around an achingly trendy pool, or being fitted with impractical shoes on Rodeo Drive... but Nicollette and Lindsay Lohan have become pioneers of an unlikely legal chic trend.

And while they may not have wanted to appear in court in the first place, 25-year-old Lindsay perhaps more vehemently than Nicollette, they'll be damned if they don't use the opportunity as a showcase.

L.A law: Lindsay Lohan and Nicollette both bring the same kind of platinum blonde starlet glamour to their appearances at court in California

And so they should, both starlets found themselves in the drama keg that is a courtroom at a time when their careers were nothing short of moribund.

It's given Lohan's career CPR, being reprimanded so publicly while she pouts like the starlet the world never knew it wanted until now, and it could revive Sheridan's prospects if she plays her cards right.

Whatever happens, both platinum blondes have looked spectacular in tailored clothes and vertiginous pumps that never veered towards stripper territory.

These unfortunate sets of circumstances have given two great actresses, who lost their way for various reasons, a chance to shine again... albeit on an unlikely stage.
