Anyone struggling to decide on a venue for their upcoming nuptials, take note. 

American couple, Cheetah Platt and Rhiann Woodyard, have come up with the ultimate way to celebrate their love: by getting married in as many places around the world as they can in just under 90 days.

The adventurous pair first came up with the globe-trotting plan after getting engaged last year - and finding themselves unable to come up with one specific theme or idea for the big day.  

Cheetah Platt (left) and Rhiann Woodyard (right), from Los Angeles, have decided to get married in 12 countries around the world

Their round the world adventure first began on February 8, when they packed two big backpacks and headed to Bogota, Colombia.

During their three month journey, the couple hoped to visit 12 countries to have 38 wedding ceremonies in 83 days. 

Platt and Woodyard, who live in Los Angeles, admit that they did look for a traditional venue in their hometown, but nothing felt special and many they saw were simply outside of their price range.

'A lot of women spend a whole lot of time and stress and money on their one day and then it's over,' Woodyard told Buzzfeed.

'I love that I get to marry [Platt] over and over again.

'It's exciting that it's not just done in one day.'  

One of the couple's most recent stops? Egypt, where they tied the knot in front of an audience of camels and pyramids in the background

Platt and Woodyard first embarked on their round-the-world trip on February 8, flying to Bogota, Colombia

With the help of generous donors, Platt and Woodyard are scheduled to have 38 ceremonies in just 83 days

During their trip, the pair have decided to wear white at all times - and they will be married in the same outfits during each ceremony

One of the first few stops, the couple stopped in Spain for a beautiful ceremony amid the dramatic architecture 

When they aren't officiating their stunning ceremonies, the couple takes in local experiences, like the Giraffe Center in Nairobi, Kenya

One of their favourite ceremonies took place in Mumbai, India. 'What a wonderful wedding!' Platt wrote. 'This ceremony meant so much.'

With the help of honeymoon registry website, Honeyfund, the two were able to raise funds for this once in a lifetime journey.

Posting the costs of the hotels they hoped to stay in and flights they hoped to take during their travels, Woodyard and Platt sourced the amounts needed to jet from the United States to Europe, Africa, Asia and everywhere in between, before returning to Los Angeles for a ceremony with friends and family in May.

And forget paying for officiants in dozens of cities around the world, Woodyard and Platt were ordained online through the church of Spiritual Humanists so that they could marry each other.

'We're so excited for this once in a lifetime opportunity and we can't wait to make these dreams come true,' the pair wrote online.

And the couple, who are both talented aerial performers, will also be using the experience as an opportunity to mix business with pleasure.

'We will be teaching, training and performing partner acrobatics all over the world,' they continued.

'It's such an incredible way for us to share our skills, our passion and our talents with others.' 

'Wedding in front of the Roman aqueduct in Segovia, Spain,' Platt captioned this snap on Facebook. 'How did I get to be so lucky?!'

The couple's second ceremony, also in Colombia, took place in the lush greenery for which the South American country is known

In Ireland, the pair had three ceremonies in one day! Here, they are standing in Glendalough Cathedral in the Wicklow Mountains

Passersby often snap photos of the couple, who usually take their own photographs afterwards showcasing their aerial skills

In between weddings, the pair carved out some time to take a stroll in one of Madrid's most famous parks

While in Africa, the couple got married again in a 'romantic Casablanca wedding,' which took place in the evening 

The first wedding took place in Colombia. 'Many more to come,' Platt posted on Facebook. 'I have finally married the woman of my dreams!'

Woodyard made her own bouquet - using dollar store flowers and old costume jewellery. 'She is amazing,' Platt captioned the photo.

So far, Platt and Woodyard have visited Spain, Ireland, Kenya, Egypt, Morocco, India, and Thailand.

Although they had originally hoped to be married on all seven continents, due to the cost associated with travelling to Antarctica, they opted to scrap that plan.

With careful budgeting, the couple was able to to find 'round-the-world flights landing in 11 countries for less than $3,000 USD per person.' 

'A lot of people say you should travel with the person you're going to marry,' Woodyard added. 'We get to learn about each other everyday more and more and I love that it's brought us close.'

For those looking to follow the couple on their journey, they are posting photos and updates on Facebook.
