Howard Webb may have thought it was Groundhog Day as he was appointed to the same game at the same stage of the World Cup four years on.

Brazil easily beat Chile 3-0 in 2010, but he faced a sterner test this time.

The most contentious moment for Webb came in the 54th minute as Hulk appeared to restore Brazil's lead.

Handball: Webb indicates why he disallowed Hulk's strike which looked to have given Brazil the lead

Unhappy: Brazil coach Scolari argues with Webb and the fourth official Felix Brych after the decision

Good call: Although on first viewing the goal looked legitimate, Webb rightly spotted Hulk's handball

However, Webb's assistant Mike Mullarkey flagged to indicate that the forward had controlled the ball with his upper arm. Webb disallowed the goal and cautioned the Brazilian forward.

Replays were not 100 per cent clear but I thought that the decision was correct as the striker deliberately put his arm out and the ball was controlled from it.

Some have suggested that any doubt is supposed to be given to the attacker. That is not correct unless in an offside situation.

Brazil were perhaps more unfortunate in the first half when Hulk was tripped when clean through but Webb, with a poor view, waved appeals aside.

Protest: The Brazilian forward was convinced his goal should have been allowed to stand

Outrage: Hulk complains to assistant referee Michael Mullarkey but the English officials got it right

1min: Blows his whistle to kick off the last 16 match between Brazil and Chile in Belo Horizonte.

4min: Fernandinho commits a late challenge on Charles Aranguiz which must risk a booking but decides to just award a free-kick.

5min: Aranguiz responds in kind, bringing down Neymar but again only awards a free-kick.

11min: Chile appeal for a penalty when Eduardo Vargas goes down under David Luiz's challenge but is not impressed.

13min: This time it is Brazil's turn to claim a spot-kick when Hulk tumbles while being chased by Mauricio Isla but again refuses the appeals.

17min: Books Eugenio Mena after a clear handball meaning the Chile full-back would miss his next match.

18min: Opening goal for Brazil - correct decision not to award offside.

23min: Speaks severely to Neymar after the Brazilian is involved in an altercation with Gary Medel.

28min: Brazil are unhappy when two crunching challenges on Neymar by Francisco Silva and Arturo Vidal do not bring yellow cards.

40min: Books Silva for a foul on Neymar - meaning he too would be out of any quarter-final.

55min: Controversy. Disallows a goal by Hulk and books the Brazil forward after assistant flags that he controlled a cross with upper arm. Hulk is furious.

60min: Books Luiz Gustavo for bringing down Vidal - he too would miss quarter-final.

90min: Blows for end of normal time with score 1-1.

91min: Awards a free-kick near the Chile penalty area after Eugenio Mena brings down Hulk.

93min: Books Jo for a high challenge on keeper Claudio Bravo.
