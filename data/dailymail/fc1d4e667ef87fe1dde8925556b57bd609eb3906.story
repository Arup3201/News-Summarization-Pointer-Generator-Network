Ander Herrera would pick Anders Lindegaard as his goalkeeper in his Manchester United five-a-side team - because he wants to score past Spain team-mate David de Gea!

The 25-year-old midfielder's side would also feature two Englishmen and another Spaniard.

Alongside himself and Lindegaard, Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata and Chris Smalling make the starting line-up.

Speaking to manutd.com in a question and answer session, when asked about who would feature in his five-a-side team, Herrera replied: 'Anders (Lindegaard), because I want to score against David [De Gea]!

'I'd pick Rooney because he's always very competitive and I always want to be alongside him.

'Smalling - he's aggressive and we need a defender!

'And Juan Mata because we know each other very well.'

Herrera arrived at United from Athletic Bilbao in the summer - and has already singled out his United skipper as the hardest trainer.

When asked who the most competitive in training was, he replied: 'Wazza. Wayne Rooney, always.'

He also believes it is a straight choice between Rooney or Mata for who has netted the best goal he's ever seen in training.

Herrera said: 'I'd say Wayne (Rooney) or Juan (Mata) because they spend a lot of time practising free-kicks - they score some fantastic goals.'
