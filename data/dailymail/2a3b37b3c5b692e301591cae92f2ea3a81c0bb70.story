While her musical back catalogue might not attract many takers, Victoria Beckham's critically-acclaimed fashion line is a different story.

The designer has announced she is to re-release some of the most popular pieces from past collections, starting next month when the newly revamped victoriabeckham.com website launches.

Named the 'Icon collection', the range will include reworked versions of best-sellers past, including the tight bandage style frocks worn by Kate Winslet and Kim Kardashian among others.

Iconic: Victoria Beckham (right) is to re-release pieces from past collections

Back for good: Despite juggling a move with the demands of four children, Beckham has found time to re-release a range of dresses from collections past

'I hope these updated styles will become unique, limited edition pieces,' Beckham, who recently relocated to London from Los Angeles, explained to Elle UK.

'I am excited to revisit archive designs as the Icon collection continues to grow.'

Prices for dresses in the collection, which date from the S/S09 collection onwards, will start at £1,000, and will be sold online.

Speaking of her decision to sell the 
Icon range online, Beckham said: ‘Together with my personal edit of the 
SS13 collections I wanted to be able to offer an exclusive product on 
the site that was in keeping with the signature aesthetic that’s very 
special to me,’

It's a decision that puts the Victoria Beckham brand at odds with some of the world's most iconic fashion houses, including Chanel, which recently revealed that its clothes will never be sold online.

'We have to find the right balance for our customers,' Bruno Pavlovsky, Chanel’s president of global fashion, told Bloomberg.

'What they want is to feel unique,' continued Pavlovsky. 'Fashion is about clothing, and clothing you need to see, to feel, to understand.'

A-list favourite: Although VB has racked up an 
impressive celebrity following, the kaiser is Karl Lagerfeld. Fans 
include Vanessa Paradis (right) and Keira Knightley

Not online: Although fans of Chanel might want it, the brand has no plans to go online
