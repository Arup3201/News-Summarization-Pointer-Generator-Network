Changed man: Dr Paul Wood was released from prison in 2006 after serving almost 11 years for murder

A former drug addict and convicted killer has told how he turned his life around during his 11 years in prison - and now has a doctorate in psychology.

New Zealander Dr Paul Wood, 37, earned two degrees and began his PhD while behind bars - but says he should not be a rare success story.

At the age of 18, two days after his mother passed away from cancer, Paul killed his drug dealer with a softball bat inside his home in Auckland.

It was New Year’s Eve 1995, Paul was hooked on morphine and the 42-year-old man had just made an ‘aggressive’ sexual advance towards him.

Paul has spoken out about his time in prison in the same week that campaign group JustSpeak release their report into the New Zealand prison system.

Paul said he initially began taking drugs as a teenager after getting involved with a bad group of friends and his addiction spiralled out of control when his mother became ill.

‘As she got sicker and sicker, I got heavier into it. I came from a family of boys, we were all pretty tough. Mum was the emotional support. She was the only person I had in my life in that sense,’ he told MailOnline.

‘I didn't cope very well, I made some really bad decisions that got me into a bad situation.’

‘Two days after my mother died I caught up with a drug dealer, he made a sexual advance and I made a violent reaction,’ Paul said.

Paul was arrested at the scene after neighbours heard the fighting inside his home and called the police. This is something he is grateful for as it forced him to own up.

‘I thought this was the end of my life. I thought “this can't be real”,’ he said.

When he was handed a minimum 10-year sentence, Paul said it sounded like ‘forever’.

He remembers feeling ‘the greatest despair imaginable’.

He was still hooked on morphine and was going through withdrawal when he was jailed.

‘I felt that I had been the victim. I recognised that my response had caused the death of someone else but I also felt that I was the victim,’ he said.

As he arrived at prison in 1996 he received a terrifying greeting.

‘People kicked their doors and shouted “hang yourself or I'm going to come and get you tomorrow”… I remember thinking “what have I got myself into”.’

Paul admitted he got into a lot of fights at school but was ‘always polite to teachers’.

‘I had a bad habit of gravitating towards the bad people,’ he said. Unfortunately that habit wasn’t broken when he arrived in prison.

'For the first couple of years, I did drugs and got in fights and thought “oh well they say I’m a really bad person so that's the kind of person I will be”.

‘By the time I was 20 I was moved to maximum security because I was non-compliant, I continued to do drugs - anything I could get my hands on, mostly smoking weed every day.’

After prison: Paul (on the right) in 2007 shortly after his release from prison. 'My brother Chris (left) wanted to take me to do something awesome, so took me snowboarding, and it was awesome,' Paul said.

Then one day on his maximum security block at Auckland Prison Paremoremo, Paul met his first mentor – a convicted safe cracker - who allowed him to imagine a different path in life.

‘They got me into education and learning things. I realised how knowing things can enrich your life. He got me into reading books and it was there I got my idea for studying psychology.’

Paul saw lots of people in prison with mental health issues and wanted to understand the mind.

'Education led me out of danger,’ he said.

He was surprised when he passed his first two psychology degree papers – especially after dropping out of high school.

‘It made me think I was capable of more… but to do that I had to stop smoking weed and drugs because I was spending all time in solitary confinement.’

Thanks to the support of his father, who visited him every weekend for almost 11-years, and Massey University whose lecturers travelled two hours out of their way to visit Paul in prison, Paul went on to complete his masters and was halfway through his PhD by the time he left jail.

Moving forward: 'I'd like to see a prison that tries to help people figure out who they would most like to be,' Paul explained

'I think they saw that I was generally interested in trying to be a better person and be who I really was,’ he explained.

'My father visited me every weekend. He would bring me my books, send out assignments.

‘In the early years he would come and visit me and I would have black eyes. It must have been so bad for him, I can only imagine now how powerless he must have felt. He just hoped that I was going to survive prison,’ Paul said.

Paul admits he had drug relapses while in prison but was completely clean for the last five years of his sentence.

‘I've seen plenty of people who couldn’t get off that revolving door. But I think all of us have potential to change,’ he said.

'I felt so free years before I actually got out of prison.’

Teaching: Paul now coaches others on changing their lives and has even gone back and spoken to prisoners in his former jails

He believes prisoners should be given an informed choice of their options and should really become accountable for their offending.

He says when prisoners are punished they adopt a victim mentally and this prevents them from addressing the problem as they are busy trying to protect themselves instead.

'I'd like to see a prison that tries to help people figure out who they would most like to be,’ he said.

Paul is not against prisons and believes they are ‘absolutely necessary for the worst offenders’ and people with ‘pathological issues’.

But he thinks the majority of criminals are people who may bad decisions.

'I get asked about this stuff because I'm considered an exception - but shouldn't I be the rule? Aren’t I what prisons are supposed to create?’

Paul has received a negative backlash against his views but thinks that whatever stand you take personally, talking about prisoner rehabilitation is an 'important conversation for society’ to have.

‘You have to be honest. If you want to punish people harshly you can, but don’t do so under the guise that it will help reduce re-offending,’ he said.

Since being released from prison in 2006, Paul collected his PhD in 2012 and has set up his own coaching and consulting company.

He is in love, after meeting a ‘very smart, no nonsense woman’. She Googled him after their first date two years ago.

‘She was honest and said I know a lot about you but you don’t know much about me,’ he said.

‘She believes in people’s capacity to change and grow.’

The couple have their first child on the way, which Paul describes as the 'most amazing' thing that’s happened to him.
