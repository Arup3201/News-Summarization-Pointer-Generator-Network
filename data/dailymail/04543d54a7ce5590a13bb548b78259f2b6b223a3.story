Britain risks becoming a nation of ‘disposable pets’ unless high street shops are stopped from selling puppies and kittens, an MP said today.

Labour's Robert Flello said the Government needed to tackle the ‘puppy farms’ which sell animals to pet shops.

He said these breeders often mistreat puppies and kittens and separate them from their mothers at an early age, which leads to life-threatening problems including infectious diseases and poor immune systems.

Puppies should not be 'farmed' and sold in 'pet supermarkets', the Labour MP Robert Flello told the House of Commons today

Mr Flello said a nation of animal lovers should not risk becoming 'a nation with disposable pets'. He called for a ban on the sale of puppies and kittens in high street shops 

Tory MP Alec Shelbrooke told the House of Commons that his pet dog Boris had become better behaved after being castrated.

He said: ‘Dogs have a unique bond with us humans. 

'Our two dogs, Boris and Maggie, have a loyalty, a love, a calming nature through exercise and, of course, the comfort a dog can give you.

‘When your animals need medical attention, you worry about them like you would any other member of the family.'

He added: ‘For the first and last time, I can stand in this House and say that Boris's bad behaviour was improved immensely when I had him castrated.

‘He did have a castration operation when he was younger and that night he got constant attention, because they are like a member of your family.

'The public when we go out and buy an animal, we need to expect those animals are getting a healthy start in life, that they are well looked after.’

Some puppies can also pose a risk to their owners in later life due to their mistreatment, Mr Flello added.

Irresponsible breeders usually sell the animals privately, on the internet or to retail outlets.

But banning the sale of puppies and kittens in pet shops, garden centres and ‘pet supermarkets’ is the easiest way to have an immediate impact on the problem, Mr Flello said.

He said local councils may already have the power to restrict pet shop licences to stop them selling certain types of animals, and if so they should stop the sale of puppies and kittens.

Opening a debate on a backbench business motion in the Commons, Mr Flello said: ‘We consider ourselves to be a nation of animal lovers where a dog is a man's best friend, a pet cat, a pet dog is part of the family.

‘But every day puppies and kittens are bought from pet shops or garden centres that become ill. All too frequently they die as a result of the supply chain from irresponsible breeder to pet shop.

‘Quite frankly I can't think a nation of animal lovers would allow this to continue.

‘Are we at risk of becoming a nation with disposable pets?’

Mr Flello said the sale of puppies and kittens on the high street can lead to impulse-buying, leaving owners with the burden of unhealthy animals that may have behavioural problems, which can lead to pets being abandoned.

He said: ‘Puppies and kittens are housed and sold without their mothers and the presence of such retail outlets encourages impulsive buying, irresponsible breeding, and commoditisation of these animals, as well as too often leaving prospective owners with the burden of life-threatening health and behavioural problems associated with pet shop puppies.

‘The Government can therefore have an immediate effect without any excessive enforcement costs by banning the sale of puppies and kittens on high street premises.’

Mr Flello acknowledged that improving public information to encourage people to only buy puppies and kittens when their mother is present is important, but the banning of their sale on the high street is needed to combat impulse-buying.

Tory MP Alec Shelbrooke revealed he had two dogs - one called 'Boris' and the other 'Maggie'

He said: ‘Information is absolutely important but, with all the best information in the world, if you happen to be buying a container of goldfish food from the local pet shop with your family and they see a cute puppy or a cute kitten that's where a problem arises - the impulse purchase.’

The MP added: ‘My intention from this motion is not to vilify pet shops per se but in almost every case where they sell puppies and kittens they simply can't meet the specific needs required in this developmental golden period for puppies to learn their future emotional template, in order to exhibit normal behaviour patterns, to safely adjust to family life, as well as all the health implications.’

Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee chair Anne McIntosh said self-regulation and better public information was the way forward.

She said: ‘I'm slightly confused as to why a great deal of emphasis in your speech was on pet shops because my understanding is that pet shops are the one part of the trade that is pretty much regulated.’

She went on: ‘The message that I think should go forward from the House today is that there is a role for self-regulation.

‘Surely to any responsible potential dog or cat owner we should not be buying puppies or kittens where the mother is not present.

‘That is so self evident. Do we need to legislate that? Is that something we just need to go out and educate the public on?’
