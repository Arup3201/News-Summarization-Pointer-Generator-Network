Victoria's children's commissioner Bernie Geary has blasted Jamie Oliver, calling him 'a d***head' and cruel' for disciplining his daughter by feeding her one of the world's hottest chilis.

The celebrity chef admitted on Monday that because 'you can't smack naughty kids' when one of his four young children became unruly or disrespectful, he would coat their sliced apple with a type of chili known as the Scotch bonnet.

Scotch bonnets have a  rating on the Scoville scale, which measures chili heat, of 100,000 to 350,000, making them up to 140 times hotter than a normal chili pepper.

Speaking with Radio 3AW's Neil Mitchell, Mr Geary said, 'He's a d***head Neil. It's just not appropriate to use cruelty as a form of discipline.' Mr Geary went on to say that Oliver's chili trick was a form of 'child abuse'.

'Way off the planet': After Jamie Oliver (above, left) admitted he used ultra-hot chilis to discipline his children when they were naughty, Victoria's children's commissioner, Bernie Geary (above, right) described him as 'cruel' and ' a d***head'

'This bloke, he should realise the influence he has as a high-profile public figure and a high-profile father,' Mr Geary said.

'If he's joking it's not even appropriate because some parents and families might think it's a legitimate or alternative way of disciplining children. He's way off the planet as far as I'm concerned.' 

Mr Geary was responding to Oliver's extraordinary confession about how he disciplines his children, saying on Monday, ‘I give them chillies for punishment. It is not very popular beating kids any more, it’s not very fashionable and you are not allowed to do it and if you are a celebrity chef like me it does not look very good in the paper. So you need a few options.'

Oliver said he had once tricked his 12-year-old daughter into eating an ultra-hot Scotch Bonnet, much to the annoyance of his wife, Jools.

At the BBC Good Food Show, Oliver said: ‘Poppy was quite disrespectful and rude to me and she pushed her luck. In my day I would have got a bit of a telling-off but you are not allowed to do that.

‘Five minutes later she thought I had forgotten and I hadn’t. She asked for an apple. I cut it up into several pieces and rubbed it with Scotch Bonnet and it worked a treat. She ran up to mum and said, “This is peppery”. I was in the corner laughing. [Jools] said to me, “Don’t you ever do that again”.’

Mr Geary, who is Victoria's Commissioner for Children and Young People, said Oliver's role as an educator made his actions even more troubling.

'He purports to be a teacher and a role model and works with children. If he worked in a school in Victoria they'd sack him,' he said.

'If you were cruel to children in that way here in Victoria in a school you'd get sacked. It's a way of assaulting children. It's child abuse.' 

Given his struggle to impose order on daughters Poppy Honey Rosie, Daisy Boo Pamela, 11, and Petal Blossom Rainbow, five, and son Buddy Bear Maurice, four, perhaps it is no surprise Oliver is not keen to add to his family.

He revealed he argued with his wife of 14 years about the idea, saying: ‘You know what she said last night? She is 40 in about ten days and I took her out and she goes, “OK are we going to have another kid then?” I said, “You what?”.

‘The woman wants another baby. So watch this space. But with all the power in my body we are not having another baby.’

He admitted, however, that Mrs Oliver usually wins the arguments at home – even about food.

He said: ‘My wife loves a destroyed steak. I have been with her since I was 18 years old, how romantic, but it is hard to keep loving someone when they want a well-done steak. I have tried to tell her but she is a very single-minded, dominant woman.’

The couple – who have a combined wealth of £240million – met when they were 17. The chef drove to a cinema, but crashed the car. He has joked she started dating him out of pity as a result.

Mrs Oliver, a former model, has worked as her husband’s PA and now designs children’s clothing.

Jamie Oliver, who was named as a Special Achievement Honouree at the LOVIE awards last week, said his wife Jools has asked whether they can have another child - their fifth - but the chef has said no
