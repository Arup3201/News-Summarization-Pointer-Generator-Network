America faces its first government shutdown in 17 years amid dispute over healthcare reforms

America faces its first government shutdown in 17 years beginning at midnight tonight as Republicans and Democrats fight bitterly over Barack Obama’s healthcare reforms.

Under pressure from hardline members 
tied to the Tea Party movement, the Republican-controlled House of 
Representatives is using a government funding bill to attack the 
adoption of the controversial policy, called ‘Obamacare’.

The House approved the bill yesterday on the proviso that it delays the new healthcare law for a year and repeals a tax meant to pay for it.

But, even before the House voted for the
 amendment yesterday following an angry debate in which members
 shouted each other down, the Democrat-controlled Senate pledged to 
block it when it meets today - making a shutdown all but 
inevitable.

Mr Obama has insisted he will not see his healthcare reforms - his biggest domestic achievement-  gutted.

If this happens, overall funding to government departments – due by an October 1 deadline – will not go through. 

More than 800,000 federal staff deemed non-essential – including park rangers and passport officials – will be put on forced unpaid leave.

Millions more may have to work unpaid to keep critical services such as border patrol and air traffic control running.

A spokesman for the President accused the Republicans of being ‘reckless and irresponsible’ and other Democrats said the opposition was putting contempt for the President above the good of the country.

But Republican campaigners insisted they have the public on their side and claimed the health law that will reduce the quality of medical care and cost jobs by forcing employers to provide healthcare.

Republican representative Robert Pittenger said Americans dislike ‘this crazy, delusional idea that nationalized, centralized planning will work’.

If the government shutdown goes ahead military personnel will still be paid, but half the Pentagon’s civilian staff will be temporarily laid off, prompting Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to claim US military capability would be weakened.

‘This is an astoundingly irresponsible way to govern,’ he said.

'If this continues, we will have a country that is ungovernable'.

Millions may have to work unpaid as critical services such as border patrol, air traffic control and meat inspection continued to function.

The last shutdown, in 1995 to 1996, cost the US more than $1 billion and seriously dented the popularity of the Republicans, who were principally blamed.

Their slump in the polls helped Democrat Bill Clinton win a second presidential term.

But with Obama flailing in the polls and increasingly being seen as a lame duck president, many Republicans feel he is particularly vulnerable now.

The Republicans are still threatening to stop the government borrowing any more money, potentially leading the US to default on its debts, something Obama has warned would have a ‘profound destabilizing effect’ on the world economy.

They say they will only agree to increase the government’s debt ceiling if the White House agrees to a string of conservative demands such as delaying Obamacare and green-lighting a major new oil pipeline.

The Congress has only weeks to reach agreement after the Treasury Department announced last week that the government will reach its borrowing limit by October 17.

In a government shutdown, spending for essential functions related to national security or public safety would continue along with benefit programs such as Medicare health insurance and Social Security retirement benefits for seniors.

But civilian federal employees - from people who process forms and handle regulatory matters to workers at national parks and museums - would be furloughed.

The last government shutdown ran from December 16, 1995, to January 6, 1996, putting about 800,000 federal workers on furlough.

Here is a roundup of the expected impact of a shutdown:

FEDERAL WORKERS

Up to 1 million U.S. federal workers could face furloughs without pay beginning on Oct 1.

Most federal agency workers would be furloughed, but a small number of 'excepted' employees must continue to work. These include security workers such as air traffic controllers and prison guards. Congressional staffers could work if requested by the lawmaker or committee that employs them.

Congress has previously paid federal workers for their furlough days.

Federal workers could face penalties if they tried to do any work during the furlough.

FINANCIAL MARKET CONSEQUENCES

Apart from potential market swings, companies hoping to raise money in an initial public offering could face delays.

Businesses will still be able to file certain documents to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but the agency said on Friday that processing and approving applications will be discontinued during a shutdown.

'Capital-raising will have a huge hiccup if the SEC shuts down as it has said,' said Eric Jensen, a partner with law firm Cooley LLP in Palo Alto, California.

Drug companies waiting for a decision from the Food and Drug Administration could also see delays. The FDA said it would continue 'limited activities' related to programs that are paid for by user fees from drug approval applications.

GOVERNMENT CONTRACTORS

A shutdown lasting less than two weeks would not hurt big defense contractors, which can survive temporarily without federal contract payments, said ratings agency Standard & Poor's. But a longer shutdown could weaken the financial profiles and liquidity positions of smaller defense contractors.

'It is felt a heck of a lot more keenly by small contractors,' said Bradley Wine, co-chair of Morrison & Foerster's government contracts practice.

MEAT INSPECTORS

Meat inspectors for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, considered necessary to national safety would stay on job.

U.S. ARMED SERVICES

All military personnel would continue in a normal duty status. But a large number of civilian employees would be temporarily furloughed, according to the Pentagon. Official furlough notices would be issued on October 1 if no agreement to fund the government has been reached.

FEDERAL COURTS

Federal courts will remain open for about 10 business days. By October 15, the Judiciary will need to provide more guidance.

The Supreme Court, which is scheduled to start its fall 2013 session on October 7, declined to comment on whether it has plans for a government shutdown. But a court spokesman noted that in past shutdown situations, the court continued operating as normal.

IRS

The Internal Revenue Service has a major tax due date on October 15 for Americans who got an extension to file their 2012 taxes, which were due on April 15. The IRS will be accepting tax returns and other tax payments during a shutdown, but will suspend many other activities, including audits.

About 90 percent of the IRS's 90,000 workforce would be furloughed, the agency said on Monday, meaning call centers would be closed and audits halted.

HEALTHCARE LAW

President Barack Obama's 2010 healthcare reform law is scheduled to debut on October 1 when people can start shopping for health insurance. Money to fund implementation of the healthcare law, known as Obamacare, has already been committed.
