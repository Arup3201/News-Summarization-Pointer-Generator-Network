A woman who was having an affair with her daughter's 17-year-old boyfriend convinced him to help her attack her ex-husband and his new wife by threatening to reveal the relationship, he has claimed.

Jonathan McMeekin, who is now 26, testified at Sandra Rogers' trial in Lake County, Illinois that she had forced him to carry out the grisly sledgehammer attack in May 2003 - about six months after they had started having sex.

He said that he felt pressured into carrying out the crime as Rogers had allowed him to share a bed with her daughter Robin, then 14, let him use her car, and bought him marijuana and other gifts.

'She would cook for me, clean, do my
laundry, give me lunch money, those kinds of things,' McMeekin said, theÂ Chicago Tribune reported. 'She told me that I owed her.'

In the middle of the night on May 19, 2003, the pair allegedly broke into Rick Rogers' and Angela Gloria's home in Lincolnshire, Illinois and Rogers allegedly repeatedly hit them over the head with a sledgehammer.

The couple were left hospitalised and were lucky to survive, prosecutors said.

'She said if I didn't go with her, she 
said she would tell Robin I was having sex with her,' McMeekin, said. 'I decided to go with her because I 
didn't want Robin to know.'

McMeekin pleaded guilty to  two counts of attempted murder in 2004 and has already served 10 years of a 20-year prison sentence.

Sandra Rogers, who is now 56, is charged with conspiracy to commit murder, attempted 
murder and home invasion, and has also spent the last decade in prison
after accepting a 2004 plea deal.

But that deal was dismissed last year when Judge John Phillips said she was 
tricked into admitting her part in the crime, which paved the way for the trial. But she remains in jail on a $4 million bond.

Her lawyers have tried to suggest it was her daughter, Robin, who took part in the attack with McMeekin, pointing out that the teenager said she wanted to kill her father.

But prosecutors have dismissed these simply as teenage outbursts.

McMeekin has suggested that Rogers had her own motives to carry out the attacks, as her husband had just re-gained custody of her two daughters.

She also told her young lover that she worried she would be arrested as she allowed her 14-year-old daughter to share the same bed as McMeekin, even though her father was against it.

He had initially told police he acted alone and led investigators to a river near the couple's home where his bloody clothes and a sledgehammer were found.

But several months later, he claimed Rogers had organised the attack and was the one who had made the near-fatal blows with the weapon.

One of the victims, Angela Gloria, also took the stand on Monday. She said she remembered going to bed before waking up in hospital days later.

'I called myself Peanuthead,' she said. 'I had 
an indent on the side of my head. I had nine plates in my head at one time. I looked like Frankenstein.'

Scars can still be seen on her face and her speech stumbles. She also suffers from short-term memory loss and had to learn how to walk again, she said.

The trial continues.
