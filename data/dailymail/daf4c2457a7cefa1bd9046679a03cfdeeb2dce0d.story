WOUNDED TIGER: A HISTORY OF CRICKET IN PAKISTAN by Peter Oborne (Simon & Schuster £25)

One of the many strange things about Pakistani cricket is that the aggression, the competitiveness and the bloody-mindedness the team displays on the pitch are nothing compared with what goes on in the dressing room.

Reading Peter Oborne’s splendidly eccentric, if at times understandably exasperated, history of Pakistan cricket, I lost track of the number of times a player threw a tremendous strop and stomped off into the sunset.

Matters were not helped when Saeed Ahmed, booked to go out to bat at the fall of the first wicket, locked himself in the bathroom and refused to come out, Oborne notes wearily of the first Test against England in 1967. Only a few pages later, Saeed Ahmed is at it again, this time going AWOL on a shopping trip with his wife.

On one occasion, in 1976, the Pakistan squad was riven by such dissent that two separate teams turned up to contest the second Test against New Zealand, one captained by Intikhab Alam and the other by Mushtaq Mohammad. ‘Who’s coming to toss with me,’ asked the puzzled New Zealand captain, Glenn Turner, ‘Mushy or Inti?’

As Oborne points out, deep fissures have run through Pakistani cricket ever since Pakistan became a country in 1947.

To begin with, the shadow of colonialism was never far away. Much to the annoyance of local players, the cricket ground in Rawalpindi was dominated by an enormous statue of Queen Victoria. When the first Pakistan team to tour England arrived in 1954, they were treated either with lofty disdain, or baffled incomprehension by their hosts.

After each day’s play, the team would go back to their B&B to wash their kit, while their captain tried to teach them how to hold a knife and fork.

However, there was a taste of things to come when, having been comprehensively whacked in the first three Tests, Pakistan won the fourth test at the Oval by 24 runs.

Among the delighted spectators was one General Ayub Khan, who was later to mount a military coup — thereby setting in train the pattern that has bedeviled Pakistan, and Pakistani cricket, ever since.

Cricket in Pakistan was organised very differently to other countries.

Cricketers played for teams sponsored by the armed forces, police, or government departments, with the players in effect being paid to do non-existent jobs. When he was just 15, Hanif Mohammad, who became the country’s first cricketing superstar, was appointed to the post of roads inspector by the Pakistan Public Works Department.

His younger brother Mushtaq, who soon joined him in the Pakistan team, was only 12 when he became a cement clerk in the same department.

In 1958, Hanif Mohammad scored one of the greatest of all Test innings — 337 against the West Indies in Bridgetown. It took him 16 hours and 39 minutes, at the time the longest innings ever played in first-class cricket.

Peter Oborne suggests controversial cricketer Mohammad Amir  wasn't guilty of match-fixing

There were no thigh pads in those days, and so Hanif pushed bathroom towels down his trousers to try to protect himself against the West Indian fast bowlers.

Not that it did much good — afterwards, he had a deep indentation in one of his legs, while his cheekbones were black with burned blood from spending so long in the sun.

Although this is a sober — and comprehensive — history on the one hand, it’s far less dry than this description might imply. It’s also a kind of love-letter to Pakistan cricket, a salute to its fortitude and fieryness. Oborne makes no attempt to disguise his admiration for some of the country’s most notable, and controversial, figures.

Thus, the former Pakistan captain Javed Miandad, usually depicted as a colossal egomaniac, emerges in quite different colours here — as clever, courageous, and always willing to put his team’s interests above his own.

Oborne even has some sympathetic words for the fast bowler Mohammad Amir, who was found guilty of match-fixing in 2010 and imprisoned. He insists, very persuasively, that Amir was an innocent caught up in events that were way out of his control.

What becomes plain is that, in a country beset by tribal and political schisms, cricket is one of the few things that unites people.

Remarkably, the Taliban turn out to be keen cricketers, although their insistence on wearing traditional costume apparently plays havoc with their stroke play.

Even so, there are limits. Al-Qaeda have never taken to cricket, Oborne records. It seems they’ve always preferred the considerably less macho charms of volleyball.
