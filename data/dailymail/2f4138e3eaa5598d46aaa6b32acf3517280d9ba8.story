This is the moment terrified Iraqis recorded a convoy coming towards their home - and realised it was ISIS.

The men secretly filmed as trucks and lorries bearing the Islamic State's distinctive black flag arrived in a cloud of dust and smoke.

One of the frightened civilians can be heard saying: 'Oh dear mother, they are chanting Allahu Akbar!' as a truck carrying a group of militants swoops into view.

Terrifying: Iraqis secretly recorded a convoy coming towards their home before realising it was ISIS

Trucks and lorries bearing the Islamic State's distinctive black flag arrived in a cloud of dust and smoke

It is not yet known where exactly the footage was taken, but it was posted on LiveLeak by Kurdish-Girl91 with the incident believed to have happened yesterday, according to 9news.

The film starts with the vehicles appearing away in the distance as the occupants focus their camera on a cloud of dust.

A voice can be heard saying 'Mohamed, turn off the lights for God's sake', before the cameraman replies, 'They can't see me!'.

The group then start to panic with the footage showing the ISIS extremists passing within metres of the property with one man saying: 'Careful, this one is heading towards you.'

At one point a truck carrying a group of militants swoops into view - just yards from where the men were filming

Another man then asks: 'What is this, just tell me for God's sake what is this?' as a large lorry roars past and a truck transporting terrorists comes into view.

A frightened companion can be heard saying: 'Oh dear mother, they are chanting Allahu-akbar.'

Moments later the screen goes black as the recorder is hastily turned off.
