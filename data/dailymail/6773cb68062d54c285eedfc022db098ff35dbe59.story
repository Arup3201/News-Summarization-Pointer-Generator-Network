Rare illness: Douglas Husband has had to be put on a tightly controlled diet

Meal times are predictable affairs for little Douglas Husband, who lives off a diet of potatoes - as any other food leaves him screaming in pain.

The 19-month-old's mother has found her son can tolerate spuds and butternut squash, but meat, fruit and vegetables leave him writhing in agony.

Brave Douglas suffers from eosinophilic colitis, a rare condition where too many white blood cells are produced in his intestine. As a result the cells designed to protect his body actually attack it.

The youngster had a normal, natural 
birth and, even though he arrived into the world with the umbilical cord
wrapped around his neck and needed resuscitating, he made a quick 
recovery. He was soon sent home to join mother Beverley Ward, father Tim
Husband and four-year-old sister Edie in Sheffield.

At
first when he went home he seemed fine but he was unable to settle 
easily to sleep. After a few weeks he developed a cold and started 
choking, before going limp and blue in his mother's arms.

Concerned
Beverley, 41, a writer, said: 'The day Douglas went blue and limp in my
arms was the most horrendous moment of my life, I thought he was dying.

'I
called 999 and within minutes the paramedics were at the door. He came 
round when they arrived and we took him in the ambulance to the 
Children’s Hospital in Sheffield.'

Fed up with seeing her little boy 
screaming in agony whenever he was fed, Beverley decided to film him 
feeding and showed it to the hospital.

After
a colonoscopy and endoscopy at Sheffield Children’s Hospital under 
specialist Mike Thompson, Douglas was finally diagnosed with 
eosinophilic colitis when he was 19 months old, which is a result of 
stomach acid leaking back into the oesophagus.

His mother added: 'Now we are still learning about the condition and what works for Douglas and what doesn’t.

Trial and error: Beverley Ward says she has tried feeding her son Douglas about 30 different foods, but so far only potatoes and butternut squash have worked

Little Douglas was initially diagnosed with bronchiolitis, and despite not having the same problems as other babies on the ward he was discharged and Beverley continued to breastfeed him.

She said: 'Once home, he continued to 
choke at feeds and his breathing always seemed laboured. It turned me 
into a nervous wreck.

'He 
was generally a happy-go-lucky little chap until I tried to feed him and
he’d sob through his feeds. He seemed to be waking up all night 
screaming in pain. It seemed that his bowels were causing him trouble as
well.'

'If he has an allergic reaction to 
food he scratches at his face, screams through the night, is 
bad-tempered during the day and suffers with severe constipation and 
diarrhoea. He can also come out in hives and it makes him quite ill.

'It’s
completely trial and error, we try foods and see what he can tolerate. 
So far he can only manage to eat two foods, butternut squash and potato.

Bland: A typical meal for Douglas consists of squash and potato cut up and cooked in different ways - but his condition means his parents cannot even use oil

'I try to mix it up through the day, so he has mashed potato for breakfast, baked potatoes for lunch and I’ve recently started cutting the potato up into chunks so it looks like chips - although we can’t use any oil on them.

'We’ve tried him on about 30 foods 
including meat, vegetables, fruit and rice, but he just reacts to 
everything, so we’re reluctant to try him on much else.

'He can only drink water and a 
hypoallergenic formula called Neocate which provides him with all his 
nutrients so people are surprised at how healthy he looks.

'It
is really sad that, at a time when we should be excitedly trying our 
son on lots of new foods, we are so scared of the reaction he might 
have.

'We’ve tried a range 
of drugs. Some of them have helped him but some have made his condition 
much worse as he reacts to the ingredients in the medicines in the same 
way as he reacts to food and can have different allergic reactions to 
things like colours and flavourings.

'We
have to watch him closely as he mixes with other children to ensure 
that he doesn’t eat anything that will make him ill. It can be 
heartbreaking to have to keep saying "no" to him.

'He is now on a new drug which seems 
to have stabilised him a little but he is still only eating potato and 
butternut squash. Like all children he can be faddy, it’s a real worry 
when he seems to have gone off one of his foods.'

Mike
Thomson, specialist from the Children’s Hospital, Sheffield, said: 
'Children like Douglas often go a long time without being recognised, as
in some ways this is a relatively new set of diseases to general 
practice and paediatrics alike.

Compliments to the chef: Douglas looks delighted with his plain food but his parents wish they could try giving him more varied meals

'While it will usually resolve with time it may take many years and other related problems such as eosinophilic oesophagitis - which is likened to eczema of the gullet - can ensue and last into adulthood.

'We are fortunate that a number of parent-led groups are beginning to flag this set of problems up to the wider community, but it is our responsibility as health care teams to recognise these conditions early and act appropriately with a referral to a paediatric gastroenterology department.'

Beverley added: 'It has been a long, hard journey to get to where we are but we are determined to learn more about this little known condition and to raise awareness so that children are more easily diagnosed.'
