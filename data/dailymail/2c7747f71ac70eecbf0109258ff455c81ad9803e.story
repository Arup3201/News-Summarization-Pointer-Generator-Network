Police in suburban Phoenix say officers shot a machete-wielding man after chasing him in a stolen truck he rammed into a police patrol car, seriously injuring an officer.

Avondale police Sgt. Brandon Busse says he doesn't know the condition of the man shot by police Thursday morning.

Helicopter news video showed the man falling to the ground.

Busse says the spree started when a man assaulted a city maintenance worker and stole his truck.

Suspect? The man who reportedly advanced toward police with a machete and a pocket knife was Jeremy Bustos, AZFamily reported

That's when officers shot the man, whose name hasn't been released.

The suspect reportedly was shot twice, AZCentral reported.

Superintendent Dr. Roger Freeman told the affiliate station three Littleton School District schools were briefly locked down on Thursday.

'We practice these procedures multiple times during the year,' he told AzCentral.com. 'We take the safety of our students very seriously. That's why we have these drills. It also allows us to continue with our instructional day more or less interrupted.'

On Facebook, the Avondale Police Department wrote 'Please send your thoughts and prayers for our injured Officer, whose vehicle was rammed by a suspect in a stolen vehicle this morning.'

The officer's identity also hasn't been revealed, though KSAZ reported he is in serious condition.
