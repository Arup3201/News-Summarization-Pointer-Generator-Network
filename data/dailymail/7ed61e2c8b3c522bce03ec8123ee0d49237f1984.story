The Queen’s Household Cavalry has been hit by claims that a gay soldier was bullied by a senior colleague over a number of years.

The Ministry of Defence confirmed that an investigation has been launched after the soldier made an official complaint.

The soldier – who asked The Mail on Sunday not to reveal his identity – serves in the Household Cavalry’s Mounted Regiment, which undertakes guard duty in London and takes part in events such as the Queen’s Birthday Parade.

The colleague he accuses of bullying is understood to deny the allegation and is still on duty while the Royal Military Police investigates. 

In a statement released through the Ministry of Defence, the alleged victim said he was ‘devastated’ about the potential impact of the case being made public. He said: ‘I want to get on with my career and keep my private life private.’

The Armed Forces Service Complaints Commissioner’s report in 2013 found that the Army ‘does have a problem with bullying, harassment and discrimination and that there has been an increase in the occurrence of improper behaviour, not simply an increase in complaints about such behaviour’.

However last year, Stonewall, the lesbian, gay and bisexual rights charity, named the MoD in the top 100 employers on its workplace equality index.

It was only 15 years ago, in 2000, that the MoD allowed gay men, lesbians and transgender personnel to serve openly for the first time. In the previous year, nearly 300 people were discharged from the Army alone on the grounds of sexual orientation.

An Army spokesman said: ‘Any allegation of bullying is treated extremely seriously.

‘Anyone found responsible can expect to be dealt with severely.’
