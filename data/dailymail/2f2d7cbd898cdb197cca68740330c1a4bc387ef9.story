Firefighters might be well known for rescuing cats stuck up trees.

But a crew on the Isle of Wight found something a little bigger stuck on a branch at the top of their ladder when they were called to a park on Thursday afternoon.

Charlotte Urquhart called 999 when she heard her daughter Zoe shout down from a large oak tree 'Mum, I'm stuck!'

Stuck: Firefighters came to the rescue of seven-year-old Zoe Urquhart after she got stuck while climbing an oak tree on the Isle of Wight

Rescued: A firefighter scales a ladder and helps Zoe back down to the ground

Seven-year-old Zoe had been enjoying an afternoon at the Jubilee Recreation Ground in East Cowes with her mother, 33, and sisters Cerys, 14 and Ellie, eight, when she scaled the tree but found she was unable to get back down again.

Charlotte called the Isle of Wight Fire and Rescue Service and a crew from Newport came to help the adventurous youngster down from the tree.

Ms Urquhart said: 'I kept apologising for wasting their time but I couldn’t think who else to call.

'They were really lovely and couldn’t have been more helpful, and Zoe calmed down as soon as she knew they were on their way.

She added: 'She is such a mischievous little girl and she absolutely loves climbing trees, but she has never got stuck before.

'We had just finished a picnic and Zoe asked if she could climb one of the trees. I said yes, but told her to look back after each step to make sure she didn’t go too high.

'Almost immediately I heard call out, "mum, I’m stuck".’

'She was only up there for about ten minutes before I called the fire brigade, but she was scared and I was crying.

'The branch looked quite brittle and I was worried it might break.

The mother-of-three said that her daughter has recovered from her ordeal and that she wasn't put off going back to the scene of her mishap to play later the same day.

Ms Urquhart said: 'We went out to the park again later in the afternoon, but I told Zoe no more trees for the rest of the day.'
