Lionel Messi remains a doubt for Argentina's friendly against Ecuador having missed Saturday's 2-0 win over El Salvador on Saturday.

The Barcelona forward was kept on the bench during the victory in Washington and Argentina boss Gerardo Martino has vowed not to risk the 27-year-old.

'The third training day he was unable to wear the right boot,' Martino told reporters. 'We all understand that the fans had hoped to see him play, but he was really unable.'

'If he remains this way, he won't play on Tuesday.',

On Monday, Messi welcomed new Argentina team-mate Federico Mancuello to Instagram after posting a photo with the winger to the social media site.
