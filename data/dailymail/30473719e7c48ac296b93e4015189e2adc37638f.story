New Zealand swing king Tim Southee says the Kiwis are ready to cut Australia down to size in the Cricket World Cup final on Sunday.

Southee, who has taken 15 wickets for Brendon McCullum’s men in this tournament, insists his team are riding high on confidence and ready to upset their ‘big brothers’.

As the co-hosts prepare to do battle at the MCG, Southee said: ‘The rivalry between Australia and New Zealand does cover every sport and is massive.

‘We’re probably seen as the little brothers from across the ditch and we do quite well to compete.

‘Australia have had the wood on us in cricket over the last few years but we’re slowly starting to even that ledger.

‘But as a kid growing up it was always Australia you wanted to play against.

‘You always want to have one up over the big brothers.’

Before their thrilling victory over South Africa, New Zealand had lost each of their six World Cup semi-finals. But they have already beaten the Aussies in the outstanding match of the pool stage, with the Kiwis claiming a one-wicket win in Auckland.

McCullum’s enterprising team have sparked a sporting buzz which is normally reserved for the All Blacks, although the final will be their first away game of the competition.

Expatriated Kiwis have travelled from all over the world to Melbourne, while Air New Zealand has chartered extra flights from Auckland.

Southee (left) said: ‘We get to do what a lot of people that have gone before us haven’t been able to do, and they are now behind us. The support from back home has been amazing. I can’t explain what it’s like and what it has done for the team.

‘It’s a dream come true for all the guys. As a kid, you grow up either wanting to be an All Black or a Black Cap and the guys are very excited to fulfil a childhood dream.

‘Brendon speaks a lot about it being the time of our lives. We never want it to end. One more big push and I’m sure it’s something the guys will remember forever.

‘It doesn’t get any better than taking on Australia in Australia at one of the best cricket grounds in the world.’

Australia captain Michael Clarke admitted after his side’s semi-final victory over India that defeat to New Zealand last month was ‘a kick up the backside’.

Clarke said: ‘The fact that the two hosting nations are in the final is extremely special.

‘There’s a great mutual respect between both teams. New Zealand will take confidence that they’ve beaten us in the tournament.

‘But that was the turning point in this tournament for the Australian team.

‘The boys have got out of bed every single day to try to become better and you’ve seen that in our results. We’ve been improving every game and that will hold us in really good stead.’
