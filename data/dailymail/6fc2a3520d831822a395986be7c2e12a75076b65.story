Thirteen All Blacks died during the First World War and Smith said: 'What was going through my mind actually was what if it was me that had to come over and go to war.

'Obviously, there was a lot of All Blacks involved that got stuck in that situation, and they came over and fought for what was right.

'I put myself in their shoes and it would have been tough on them and their families.'

Rugby was played at various points during the War.

During a respite from Gallipoli, the Anzac soldiers organised a game on the island of Lemnos. They played with a football because no rugby ball could be found with the New Zealanders running in 13 tries to one.

Another game was played in Paris in April 1917 against France for the Somme Cup. A crowd of 60,000 watched the game, won by New Zealand 40-0. 

The All Blacks take on England at Twickenham on Saturday.
