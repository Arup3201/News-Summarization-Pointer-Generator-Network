This is the adorable moment a mother polar bear teaches her young cubs the art of diving.

One by one, the cubs follow their mother's lead and throw themselves into the water - although the lesson appears to get too much for one cub who decides he'd rather get involved in a play fight - sneaking up behind his unwitting brother and pushing him into the pool.

The pictures were taken by Russian photographer Natalia Nazarova, 63, as she watched the young bears practicing their diving at Moscow Zoo.

'This is a very happy family of polar bears learning to dive,' the photographer said.

'You
 see the mother teaching her cubs how it's done, but they are just 
generally having fun together... Polar bears love swimming but they also
 like to play and jump into the water, so there was a lot of spray,' she added.

The polar bear is often regarded as a marine mammal because it spends many months of the year at sea. In general they live relatively unsociable lives, but they are occasionally spotted playing in the wild - sometimes for hours at a time.

'Look at me, mummy': Having watched their mother diving into the pool at Moscow Zoo, the adorable polar bear cubs decide to follow her lead. One by one the young bears leap into the water - nervously at first, but increasingly confident the more they practice

Jump: Polar bears are strong and hardy animals, but their habitat is threatened, so it is considered important to maintain a captive population. This year Moscow Zoo is expecting a new generation of polar bears to be born, so visitors will have a chance to see diving bears long into the future

Incoming: Photographer Natalia Nazarova said: 'A lot of people who see my photographs are surprised to see the unusual situation... They love the joy of seeing these strong and healthy animals so happy, as they don't expect them to be like this in a zoo'

Shake it off: Having enjoyed her time in the pool, the mother polar bear decides it's time to dry off - shaking her huge head and sending water flying everywhere

Diving lesson not interesting enough for one cub however, so he sneaks behind his brother and pushes him in
