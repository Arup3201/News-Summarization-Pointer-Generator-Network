When Dean Parnell realised his iPad had been snatched from a table in a busy city centre bar, he was determined to get it back.

Within an hour, the quick-thinking solicitor had traced the £750 Apple tablet computer to four possible addresses ten miles away thanks to an in-built tracking application.

But despite repeatedly asking police to recover the device, he was told they were too busy to attend.

Detective work: Lawyer Dean Parnell used a special app on his iPad to trace the stolen after police refused to help him

So he travelled from Birmingham to the village of Water Orton in Warwickshire to recover the iPad himself.

Last night, Mr Parnell, 45, condemned West Midlands Police for failing to help him.

He said: ‘I went to the police 
station. I was able to demonstrate that an apparent crime was taking 
place and I was turned away.

'I guess I am more angry about the way I had
been treated at the police station than I was about an opportunist who 
had pocketed my iPad.’

The drama began on Friday last week when Mr Parnell realised the 32GB retina display iPad had been taken from a table in a bar.

Tracked: A resident of Water Orton got a shock when they opened to door to find solicitor Dean Parnell on their doorstep demanding the return of his stolen iPad

Staff at a nearby Apple store showed 
him how to use the inbuilt tracking system and quickly pinpointed it to a
train heading out of Birmingham.

Mr Parnell, from Northamptonshire, 
said: ‘The train stopped at Water Orton and the iPad began moving slowly
as if someone was walking to a car park, then it began moving quickly.

‘I called the police and they said 
someone would be along shortly but no one turned up. I then rang them 
again and they said someone would ring me back, but they didn’t.’

Swiped: Dean Parnell had to turn detective after discovering his £750 iPad had been stolen while he enjoyed a night out in Bacchus Bar, pictured, in Birmingham city centre

At a local police station he was told 
nobody was available until the following day – even when he said there 
was a greater chance of ‘an incident’ without assistance from officers.

Four more calls to West Midlands 
Police proved fruitless - and during the final attempt he was told it 
was now Warwickshire Police’s problem because he was now within their 
jurisdiction.

Mr Parnell then had to ‘go through the
whole story again’ and was told a patrol car would be there within the 
hour. It didn’t arrive, and when he called back, he was told the nearest
car was still 30 miles away.

Apology: West Midlands Police have apologised to Dean Parnell after saying no detective was free to help return his stolen iPad

The commercial litigation partner 
eventually got the device back when he knocked at one of the four doors 
pinpointed by the GPS tracking application and recognised the stunned 
householder as a fellow patron of the bar he had been to.

The suspect returned the tablet 
computer – claiming he had found it and was planning to hand it in to 
Apple the following day. Police later gave him a ‘stern warning’. Mr 
Parnell, who has now received an apology from police, said: ‘The whole 
event took some four hours from beginning to end. Had it not been for my
persistence, my iPad would have ended up as another statistic.

‘I appreciate the police may have been busy but it was their total lack of interest that was what really bothered me.’

Superintendent Danny Long, of  
Birmingham West and Central Police, said the ‘standard of service’ fell 
short and that officers should have been dispatched quickly.

An investigation had found that a crime had not been committed, he said. Warwickshire Police declined to comment.
