Tottenham's Belgian duo Jan Vertonghen and Mousa Dembele have urged World Cup referees to give greater protection to team-mate Eden Hazard.

Playmaker Hazard was given a torrid time by Algeria’s defenders before setting up the Red Devils’ winner in last week’s come-from-behind 2-1 win.

Belgium’s golden generation will qualify for the last 16 with victory over Fabio Capello’s Russia in Rio on Sunday, with Felix Brych of Germany to officiate, and Dembele said: ‘Everybody knows Eden is an unbelievable talent and we also know he is going to get kicked. I hope the referees protect him a bit.’

Fierce opponents when competing against each other at club level, Belgium’s spate of Premier League superstars are learning to gel as a team under skipper Vincent Kompany.

Vertonghen says Hazard could be the man to take them far in the tournament — provided the Chelsea midfielder, who plays on the left for his country, is given the chance to display his mercurial talent.

‘Eden is the kind of player who is going to get kicked and, if I was a right-back, I think maybe I would do the same,’ admitted Vertonghen. ‘He is a player who can be very dangerous.’

The Spurs defender, who gave away the penalty that handed Algeria the lead last week, is adamant his country can cope with growing expectations back home.

‘There is a lot of pressure on us and it was difficult to play against Algeria who were very defensive,’ said Vertonghen. ‘We have a lot of experience in the Champions League, Europa League, the Premier League and other top leagues but the World Cup is a bit different.’

Marouane Fellaini will again lead the line after rescuing Belgium with a 70th-minute equaliser against Algeria. All week long, his teammates have been singing the praises of the £27.5million Manchester United midfielder who had such a disappointing first season at Old Trafford.

‘It is a big confidence boost for Marouane of course. He is training so well, we know he is hungry,’ said Dembele. ‘You don’t know what happens over there at United. We all know he is a very good player.’

Dembele and Vertonghen can’t wait to start work under new Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino following the sacking of  Tim Sherwood.

Vertonghen is understood to have fallen out with Sherwood and is targeting a top-four finish next season under the new manager.

‘I have spoken to the new manager, I think he has been in touch with a lot of the players,’ said Vertonghen, who despite speculation may now stay at White Hart Lane.

‘It was good to speak to him but he has left me to focus on the World Cup now.

‘We have all been very impressed by Southampton in the last year or two, impressed with the style they play and with their manager, so I think we made a good move to get him to Tottenham.’

Commiserations: Vincent Kompany was saddened to see England bow out of the competition so quickly

Belgium skipper Kompany, who led Manchester City to Premier League glory last term, said he was sad to see England exit the World Cup at the first hurdle.

‘The [English] players that I have as friends and that I have a lot of respect for meant I wanted them to have a good competition and I’m very saddened as much as the English fans about the exit of England,’ he said.
