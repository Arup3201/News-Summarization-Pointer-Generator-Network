Even though it’s just a week since Strictly’s rather lack-lustre movie-themed show, on Saturday the celebrities were raiding the dressing-up box again – this time for a Hallowe’en special.

Whether you believe in the supernatural or not, anybody watching the show will have to agree there was definitely something mysterious happening in the studio.

For starters there was Tess Daly wearing a stylish, modern dress that didn’t look as though it had come from the Littlewoods catalogue circa 1974.

Then a couple of Bruce’s jokes came dangerously close to being funny — and don’t even get me started on the contestants. Michael Vaughan delivering one of the best dances of the night?

Victoria Pendleton getting through a whole routine without messing it up and bawling her eyes out? There were dark forces at play all right.

But one person who was unaffected by the spooky goings-on was Sid Owen. Having thrown an almighty strop after receiving low marks for his appalling tango last week, he was determined to show the audience what he can do.

After watching his cha-cha-cha, performed to the Ghostbusters  soundtrack, it’s clear that what he can do is walk forwards and then backwards (but not in time to the music).

When the phone lines were opened the answer to the song’s ‘Who you gonna call?’ refrain was clearly: ‘Anyone but Sid.’

He ended up in the bottom two alongside the gorgeous Colin Salmon, and got the boot after the dance-off. Perhaps it was pity that made Bruno Tonioli tell Sid he believed his poor form was due to him thinking too hard. Now, I’m sure Sid is a lovely bloke but I can’t imagine his mind is ever troubled by too many thoughts.

Darcey Bussell tried to cheer up  sulky Sid by assuring him there was at least ‘more dance content’ in his performance than the previous week. What was she watching? It had as much dance content as somebody pushing a trolley around Tesco.

Sexy Colin’s salsa wasn’t his best but I do think he should be given extra marks just to make up for the height discrepancy between him and partner Kristina.

How is he meant to dance convincingly with someone who only comes up to his waist? When they’re in hold the cameraman must have to lie on the floor to get them in shot.

The biggest surprise of the evening was Michael Vaughan’s dazzling quickstep. For two weeks running he’s danced like a wooden puppet.

Then, on Saturday night, he glided across the floor like a gazelle. It was all rather puzzling. How can somebody be so awful one week and so brilliant the next? Has he been raiding Lance Armstrong’s medicine cabinet?

Hot on his heels came Victoria Pendleton dancing a tango.

In recent weeks we’ve come to expect 90 seconds of her being dragged around the floor by Brendan Cole followed by her delivering a tearful list of reasons why it all went wrong. But this week it all went so smoothly.

Poor Len looked most put out that he couldn’t offer up any of those cheesy ‘back in the saddle’ cycling analogies he’s become so fond of.

The best dance of the evening came in the form of a zombie-themed tango from Louis Smith and his partner Flavia.

It was good enough for the other three judges to give their nine-score paddles the first outing of the series – and a chance for Darcey, who seems to get a bit hot and bothered every time Louis dances, to fan herself down with hers.
