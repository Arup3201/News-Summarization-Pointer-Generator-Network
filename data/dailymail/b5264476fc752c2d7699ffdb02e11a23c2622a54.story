She's famed for her washboard 
stomach and slender thighs but now Cheryl Cole has revealed the diet  she indulges in - and it's a bit cheesy!

The 30-year-old singer has revealed that she is 'obsessed' with burrata mozzarella, a creamy calorific cheese, which has replaced sushi as her new favourite food.

Speaking to Hello! magazine about her slimmer figure, she said: 'I have been diagnosed as being intolerant to soya, so maybe that has made a difference.

'Sadly it means no more sushi - that used to be my favourite food. Now it's burrata mozzarella...I'm a bit obsessed.'

The slim star, who has been in Cannes with L'Oreal over the past fortnight, also recently revealed that she doesn't follow a diet 
and swears her favourite food is 'anything sweet'.

Speaking to FeelUnique.com, the brunette said: 'I don’t follow any strict diets, I just 
eat sensibly.

'I’m not eating McDonald’s or pizza every day but I do 
allow myself one cheat day a week, normally on a Sunday. I have a really
 sweet tooth and love cupcakes, doughnuts. Basically anything that’s 
really bad for you.'

To burn off her sweet treats, the 30-year-old sticks to a gruelling exercise regime.

Cheryl says she swears by the Tracy Anderson Method -
 the plan created by the author and multi-platform wellness entrepreneur
 whose clients also include Madonna and Gwyneth Paltrow - to keep her 
body in shape.

Cheryl explained that she uses the Tracy Anderson DVD at home to tone up and help maintain her much-envied abs.

As
 well as possessing a finely honed physique, Cheryl also regularly tops 
Most Beautiful Woman polls - an honour she still can't get her head 
around.

'I still don’t get why people call me a beauty icon. It’s so flattering, don’t get me wrong, but I just don’t get it,' she said.

Cheryl is reportedly 'really happy' with her new French boyfriend, Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini.

The couple reportedly started dating over a month ago, before being spotted at the Cannes Film Festival over the last week.

It is said the former Girls Aloud singer is delighted to be in a relationship with handsome French hunk.

A source told The Sun newspaper: 'She's really happy. They're an item and Cheryl is ready to find love again.

'After
 a difficult few years, she wants to get back out there and start having
 some fun. Things are going brilliantly in her professional life.

'She has a new song out soon and can't wait to return to The X Factor. But at the end of the day she wants to be in a relationship because that is what will make her really happy.'
