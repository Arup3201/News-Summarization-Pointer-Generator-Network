A technology company hoping to recruit bright new workers by asking them to crack a complex code that generates a phone number is yet to receive a single call because the challenge has proved just too tough.

Bigcommerce, based in Sydney, 
Australia, created the numerical riddle which when solved generates a secret number leading to a special 'Bat phone' in the company's office. But it is yet to ring.

The firm, which provides software for online businesses, say they are only
looking to recruit the best brightest engineers.

Can you crack it? Australian technology firm Bigcommerce devised a complex code in attempt to recruit bright new software engineers

Vice president of 
Engineering Soren Harner said the code was not impossible to crack as several of his staff had already done so.

He told news.com.au: 'We're looking for people who are constantly learning and hungry to improve their skills and find better ways to do things.

'The
core values around working as a team, being smart and getting stuff 
done, keeping things simple. People identity with those values.

Mr 
Harner said the aim of the code, which had been solved by several people in their office, was to find people who were talented about problem solving.

He added: 'Traditional recruitment is hit and miss in that regard, you have to rely on your gut,' he said.

Opportunity: The firm is offering the chance to work at it's trendy offices in Sydney Australia which are kitted out with ping pong tables, Xboxes and nerf guns

'We
want engineers who are enthusiastic and passionate and crack puzzles 
for fun. It also creates an element of scarcity.

'We are recruiting a lot
of people but compared to the number of people who would like to work 
in a tech start up there is a scarcity.'

Big commerce underwent a rebranding in 2009 and has received $75 million in venture capital funding, including $40 
million from the co-founder of AOL who also sits on the board.

Any successful applicants will join about 65 others in the firm's trendy inner-city warehouse offices, which are kitted out with ping pong tables, Xboxes and nerf guns.
