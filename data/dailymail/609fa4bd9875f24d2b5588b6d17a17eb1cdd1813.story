A man had his nipples cut off by a vicious gang who carved insults into his flesh and held him prisoner for hours.

Cameron Gable had 'pedo' cut into his brow and the words 'dog' and 'rat' carved on his back by three criminals who thought he owed money to a friend.

The trio, who are all drug addicts with a history of homelessness, were today jailed for at least seven years each over the attack.

Mr Gable, 35, apparently met Joshua Manneken at a casino in Melbourne last October, then went with him to a nearby flat.

The pair smoked cannabis and crystal meth with Phat Tuan Truong, Joshua Bryant-Dawson and a female friend, until the woman accused Mr Gable of owing her money for drugs.

The three men then set about him, tying him up with leather belts and stuffing his mouth with a towel and turning the radio on so that neighbours could not hear him screaming.

They tortured him for 10 hours - slicing off his left nipple, setting his hair on fire, cutting the corner of his mouth with scissors, and causing him to pass out when his penis was burnt.

At one point he managed to make it to the front door of the flat, but was dragged back into the kitchen and stabbed in the thigh with a kitchen knife.

'Blood spurted out like a hose,' Mr Gable said in a victim impact statement. 'They started to panic at how much blood there was.'

The next morning, the attackers poured disinfectant on his injuries and threw him out of the flat, where he was found by a passer-by.

Truong, 35, Manneken, 25, and Bryant-Dawson, 19, were convicted of intentionally causing serious injury, unlawful imprisonment and theft.

In his statement, Mr Gable testified that he feared the men would kill him and said he had been permanently traumatised by the assault.

'The level of aggression shown told me I wasn't going to be leaving alive,' he said.

'My personality has been changed. I don't go outside sometimes for days. I have recurring nightmares of that night.'

Judge David Beach said the length of the attack contributed to the severity of the crime, despite acknowledging that the defendants had shown remorse for their actions.

Truong was sentenced to 10 years and three months in prison, Manneken to nine years and two months and Bryant-Dawson to seven years.
