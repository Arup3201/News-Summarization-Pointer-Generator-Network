Director Peter Jackson has announced he is putting his energy into helping launch a museum to commemorate World War One after finishing his 'Hobbit' movie trilogy.

If he has any plans for future blockbusters, he's certainly not saying.

Jackson was speaking at his New Zealand post-production facility where he was helping host an event to promote the local film industry.

Jackson is a World War I history buff who owns a number of planes from the era.

He said the plan for the Wellington museum was to open during April to mark the 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli battle.

The bloody campaign in Turkey left 130,000 men dead, including at least 87,000 Ottoman soldiers and 44,000 Allied soldiers.

Of the allies, 2,779 New Zealanders (around a fifth of the number who had landed on the peninsula) and more than 8,700 Australians were killed.

Jackson said more galleries would be opened over the coming four years to mark other battles in which New Zealanders fought.

The New Zealand Herald newspaper reported earlier that Jackson had been recruited by the government to curate the museum, and he was expected to gather aircraft, tanks and other artifacts from private and public collections.

'That's where most of my time is now, which is good,' Jackson said Wednesday. 'It's fun. And it's free. The exhibits will be very, very interesting, and I'm enjoying it.'

Jackson said he was also enjoying getting some rest after finishing the 'Hobbit' - although he wasn't entirely done, because he was still working on an extended version for DVD release.

But he said he was happy to take a break from new film projects for a while.

'It's the first time in five years that I haven't woken up in the morning and had deadlines' he said. '... no phones ringing, screaming `When are we going to see this? When are we going to do that?' And I'd forgotten what that's like. So I'll let that last for a little bit longer before I destroy it.'

The trilogy finale, 'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies,' has so far earned $783 million  around the world after opening in most places in mid-December. To date, the trilogy has earned a total $2.76 billion at the box office.
