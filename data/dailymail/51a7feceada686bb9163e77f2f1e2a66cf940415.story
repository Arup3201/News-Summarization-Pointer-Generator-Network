An air hostess who posted a picture of herself giving her passengers the finger has been sacked by Aeroflot airline bosses in Russia after it ended up on Twitter.

Flight attendant Tatiana Kozlenko put the snap up on her personal page on Vkontakte, one of Russia's most popular Facebook-style social networks.

Within hours the snap - which appears to show the arm of an air hostess giving the finger to an airplane cabin full of passengers - had clocked up dozens of 'likes'.

But the image then went viral after it was posted on Twitter and reTweeted by hundreds of users.

Aeroflot airline bosses soon found out about the photo and fired Ms Kozlenko.

Aeroflot - who announced the sacking on their Twitter account - said: 'Posting this photo shows Tatiana’s attitude towards passengers and her duties. She acknowledged her fault when she spoke to her managers.' 

But Ms Kozlenko claims it isn't her arm in the snap - or even one of her her airline's planes.

She admitted that she tagged herself in the photo, which doesn't show anyone's face - but claims it isn't her.

'I don’t consider myself guilty! The photo was added to my page, I only tagged myself on it!!! The hand isn’t mine, the plane is not my company’s!!! I don’t understand what they spoil my life for!!! I’m asking you for help and support!!' she said on her Vkontakte page.

Ms Kozlenko is not the first to get in trouble over making the gesture.

Teenager Penelope Soto was jailed for thirty days after sticking her finger up at a judge during sentencing yesterday.

Soto - who was in court after being arrested for drug possession - made the gesture after Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Jorge Rodriguez-Chomat doubled the amount of her bond.

As a result she was hauled back in front of the judge and given a jail sentence for contempt of court.

Another woman was forced to apologise after an image of her flashing her middle finger at Arlington National Cemetery sparked widespread disgust across the web and prompted an online petition to get the woman fired from her job.

Lindsey Stone posted the picture of herself making the obscene gesture at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, next to a sign at the military cemetery that asks for 'Silence and Respect,' in October and the snapshot quickly went viral.

Stone issued an apology for the picture calling her gesture a 'visual pun' and saying she now realizes the picture 'was in incredibly poor taste'.
