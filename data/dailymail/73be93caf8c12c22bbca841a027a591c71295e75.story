Accident: A 68-year-old man has been arrested after mechanic Mark Roper (pictured) was crushed to death at his garage on Wednesday

A mechanic was crushed to death at work when the driver of a hire car attempted a three point turn and accidentally crashed through the garage's closed shutter doors.

Mark Roper, 32, was working on a car inside Autocraft Accident Repair Centre, in Keighley, West Yorks, when the 68-year-old driver came crashing through in his car.

The bodywork specialist from Great Horton, West Yorks, died from internal injuries after being airflifted to hospital on Wednesday morning.

The driver was arrested following the incident and has been released on police bail.

Two other men were also injured in the accident, and were treated at the scene by paramedics.

One was left with a leg injury, while the other was described as 'walking wounded'.

The immediate area was closed to traffic as a Yorkshire Air Ambulance landed at the scene.

Arif Khan, who runs the nearby Ultimate Hand Car Wash said: 'The road was full of police cars, ambulances and even a helicopter.

'Mark was a very pleasant person, a bubbly chap who was always smiling. It's such a tragedy.

'He was a bubbly sort of kid.

'If you went in there you'd leave with a smile on your face.'

A West Yorkshire police spokesperson confirmed officers were called to the Autocraft centre at around 10.40am on Wednesday following a report of an industrial accident.

Councillor Abid Hussain from the Independent party expressed his sorrow at Mr Roper's death.

He said: 'I am really sorry to hear this. I have great sympathy for his family.

'If the family needs any help then we will see what we can do for them.'

A report has been sent to Bradford Coroner and the family awaits an inquest date.

Scene of the accident: Mr Roper is believed to have been killed when a hire car reversed through the garage's closed doors while attempting a three-point turn at the Autocraft Accident Repair Centre, in Keighley, West Yorks (pictured)
