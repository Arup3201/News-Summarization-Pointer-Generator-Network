Lena Dunham got two nods from the Golden Globes on Thursday, ending a rather rough year for the actress and writer on a high note.

The 28-year-old is nominated in two categories with her hit HBO series Girls getting recognized for best comedy series and best performance by an actress (Dunham) in a comedy series.

Upon receiving the good news, Dunham retweeted a post by one of the writers on her hit HBO series: 'Every show but one in #GoldenGlobes category for comedy/musical has female show runners!'

Good news: Lena Dunham got two nods from the Golden Globes, ending a rather rough year for the actress and writer on a high note

The good news comes after a rather difficult year for the star, whose book Not That Kind Of Girl has received quite a bit of negative attention, questioning the veracity of her storytelling. 

Other stars celebrating on Thursday included Emma Stone, who is nominated for her turn in independent film Birdman.

The 26-year-old humorously wrote: 'I have no words. I am so incredibly honored and grateful for this and feel insanely lucky to have had the chance to work with Alejandro, Michael, Edward, and the whole cast and crew of the beautiful madness that is Birdman. Now can someone please explain who this "Meryl Streep" woman is?!' 

Ecstatic: Michelle Monaghan, who is nominated for True Detective, gushed after hearing the news

Celebrating: Emma Stone, who is nominated for her turn in independent film Birdman, sent out a humorous tweet (pictured with Michael Keaton)

Michelle Monaghan, who is nominated for True Detective told ABC: 'I am so proud to be a part of a series as great as True Detective. I think this might be MY "alright, alright, alright" moment. Woody and Matthew are a dream to work with.'

Adding: 'I'm actually in Australia at the moment, it's about 2:45 a.m. and it was a pretty surprising way to wake up. 

'I couldn't be happier. We are here visiting family, this was a really big surprise. I'm actually trying to keep quiet, so I don't wake up the rest of the house, but I really want to scream with joy and throw a party right now.'

Quite the turn: Jeffrey Tambor, 70, said on Live With Kelly & Michael following his nomination for Transparent: 'We are very honored'

Snubbed: Modern Family has won a Golden Globe every year since its inception in 2009, but this year was omitted from the list of nominees

Jeffrey Tambor, 70, said on Live With Kelly & Michael following his nomination for Transparent: 'We are very honored... it's a very grateful morning.'

But then added humorously: 'I grew up in a house, where anything good happened, my dad would say "Don't celebrate, they'll take it away from you." So, be cool.'

But it wasn't all roses on Thursday morning as Modern Family, which has won a Golden Globe every year since its inception in 2009, was snubbed.

Hard favourite: In the dramatic actress category Claire Danes is nominated for Homeland, which she's won twice before in the same category (over her career she's won four Golden Globes)

This year the comedy series, which is airing its sixth and final season, was omitted by the awards show for the first time. 

Meanwhile, Dunham has some stiff competition in her comedic actress category with many industry veterans receiving nods. 

Edie Falco (Nurse Jackie) and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (Veep) are nominated including relative newcomers Gina Rodriguez (Jane the Virgin) and Taylor Schilling (Orange is the New Black).

Face-off: Both Matthew McConaughey and his co-star Woody Harrelson were recognized for their critically acclaimed HBO series True Detective in the best actor category

Favourite: Game Of Thrones was nominated for best dramatic series

In the dramatic actress category Claire Danes is nominated for Homeland, which she's won twice before in the same category (over her career she's won four Golden Globes).

She is joined in the race by Viola Davis (How to Get Away with Murder), Julianna Margulies (The Good Wife), Ruth Wilson (The Affair), and Robin Wright (House of Cards)

Meanwhile, other nominees for television include nods for both Matthew McConaughey and his co-star Woody Harrelson for their critically acclaimed HBO series True Detective. 

Rookie of the year: Taylor Schilling is nominated for best actress in a comedy series

McConaughey won the best actor nod at the Emmys earlier this year for his portrayal of an existentially tortured detective in the bayou mystery.

In the best actor in a comedy category, Louis CK gets a surprise nomination in a stacked category.

Veteran Jeffrey Tambor (of Arrested Development fame) is nominated for his new series Transparent as well as William H Macy (Shameless) and Ricky Gervais (Derek).

The best dramatic series category is stacked with veteran shows like Downton Abbey, Game of Thrones, and The Good Wife. 

Heavyweight: Billy Bob Thornton's mini series Fargo is up for an award as well, facing off against True Detective

But it also welcomes a newcomer The Affair along with House Of Cards, which earned four nominations last year. 

In Dunham's best comedy series category there are a few rookies as well with Jane the Virgin, Silicon Valley, and Transparent. 

In the best mini-series category True Detective could be a heavy favourite as it faces off against many critically acclaimed shows.

Coming soon: The 72nd annual Golden Globe Awards will be presented January 11 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, hosted by Tina Fey and Amy Poehler and airing live on NBC
