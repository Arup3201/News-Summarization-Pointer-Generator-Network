An Oxo advert featuring the late Lynda Bellingham is to be screened on Christmas Day after her fans called for its return as a tribute to the much-loved actress.

Oxo said hundreds of thousands of people had been in touch with the brand asking for the 1984 My Christmas ad to be shown again in memory of her life and career.

The 66-year-old, known for her role as the Oxo mum and as a Loose Women presenter, had spoken of her plans to spend one more Christmas with her family with a real tree just days before she lost her battle with cancer on October 19.

Premier Foods, which owns the Oxo brand, said: 'The My Christmas Oxo advert from 1984, starring much-loved actress Lynda Bellingham, will be re-screened on Christmas Day in memory of her life and career.

'Over the past few weeks, hundreds of thousands of Lynda's fans have rallied behind a call for the return of the ad as a fitting tribute for all the inspiring things she achieved during her career.

'To honour the sad loss of such a fabulous actress, organisations and individuals involved in the creation and production of this initiative have given freely of their time.

'Premier Foods will make a donation to Action Against Cancer, one of the charities supported by Lynda, in line with the wishes of her family.'

The ad will air on ITV at a time yet to be confirmed and will also be available to view online throughout the day. 

The advert is narrated by Lynda's character's daughter and shows the star in her role as the mother preparing Christmas dinner and drinking sherry while her family show her their presents.

It finishes with the line: 'Everyone had the most wonderful Christmas ever. And mummy... mummy made the gravy.'

Lynda starred in the much-loved adverts - alongside on-screen husband Michael Redfern - from 1983 to 1999

Lynda had colon cancer which later spread to her lungs and liver. She was diagnosed last July but in late September she disclosed that she had decided to end her treatment to limit the amount of suffering her family would witness.

In her last few weeks, she spoke openly about her illness and its effect on her family, giving an emotional final interview to her friends on Loose Women which was screened just days after her death. 

She told how she was 'obsessed' with Christmas and was determined to see one more.

She said: 'We're going to go to the hotel and have the meal but - just my little bit of control - we're going home for pudding and presents, it's exciting.'

She told of her desire for a real Christmas tree, although her husband, Michael Pattemore, was not a fan.

She added: 'He's spent years trying to put me off a real tree and we're very lucky as we live in a converted psychiatric hospital which has got a really tall ceiling. All I've ever wanted is a real tree.

'No don't make me sweep up the pine needles, oh my goodness',' she joked, mimicking Pattemore.

'Hey I'm getting one, I'm getting a real tree. He'll just have to struggle out of the window with it afterwards, that's fine.'

Shortly after her death, a Facebook page was set up called 'Bring back the Oxo Christmas advert in memory of Lynda Bellingham'.

Organisers of the campaign, which has since had more than 150,000 'likes' on the website, welcomed Oxo's announcement today.

A post on the page stated: 'Yeah we did it!!!! Amazing... We all love you Lynda

'Looking forward to Christmas Day even more. Always in our thoughts. Thank you to Lynda's family & friends. A truly amazing lady who showed love , compassion & dignity to everyone xxxx'

Lynda's son Michael Peluso, 31, went on the page to thank everyone who had supported the campaign.

He wrote: 'Thank you so much everyone...u r all stars...thank u thank u thank u for all the support Xxx'

Oxo's announcement was revealed on ITV's Loose Women today, on which Lynda had been a long-running panellist.

Responding to the news, friend and colleague Coleen Nolan said: 'Because we know her big thing was to be here for Christmas, I feel now like she will be with us for Christmas in the way we loved and remembered her. 

'We all wanted the Oxo mum, didn't we? And to be able to see her on Christmas Day must bring so much happiness to her family.'

Describing the campaign as 'just fantastic', Ms Nolan added: 'It's one of those campaigns that starts and you think when everything has quietened down they won't bother, the fact is they've tirelessly campaigned and they've got it and it's fantastic.'
