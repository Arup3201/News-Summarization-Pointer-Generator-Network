The Queen has arrived at this year's Chelsea Flower Show with Princess Beatrice for a first glimpse before it opens to the public tomorrow.

Guided through the opulent displays at the annual horticulture show, the monarch smiled gleefully and enquired about the intricate creations.

Jerry Hall, Kirstie Allsopp, and Twiggy also dropped by the exhibition, which this year marks the First World War centenary in many of the shows.

But gardeners faced a battle to stop their blooms from wilting ahead of Her Majesty's arrival as temperature's soared above 25C.

This year, themes range from fashion to warfare; from star-gazing to different cultures; from myths to farming.

Her Majesty beamed as she was handed a traditional Thai decoration by the designers of a 100,000-flower display inspired by Thailand.

Accompanied by her granddaughter, Princess Beatrice, the monarch wore a lilac jacket and green dress without a hat, having missed the scorching weather.

Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch brought his mother Wanda Ventham, 78, as his companion for the day - and she was inundated by breathless fans demanding details about his upbringing.

Cumberbatch, 37, who wore a pink shirt, light grey jacket and sunglasses was not keen to discuss his horticultural skills.

But his mother, who plays Sherlock's mother in the BBC series, answered on his behalf, telling fans he likes to grow plants on his roof terrace.

The show gardens include a number of war-themed displays - which were opened with memorial readings by celebrities.

International: Many of the gardens took foreign horticulture as their inspiration, including this Thailand-themed exhibit made of over 100,000 flowers

Birds and traditional figurines were delicately hung amongst the blooming greens, pinks and whites in this Thailand garden, which will be presented to the Queen

Wild: From neat and vibrant flowers to over-hanging trees, the Queen was then taken into a decidedly more wild setting

Princess Michael of Kent joined the family in pale green as the scorching sun began to set. Meanwhile, the Queen joked with one of the organisers before their tour

Jeremy Paxman read a war-time poem, as did Stephen Fry who spoke at a garden which featured a model war horse.

Actors Rowan Atkinson and Nigel Havers read poems by First 
World War poets who died during the conflict, on the No Man's Land ABF 
The Soldiers' Charity garden.

The garden represents a landscape 
marked by the fighting in northern France, including trenches, a mine 
crater pond and the yew trees found in war cemeteries.

Designer Charlotte Rowe said she was 
inspired by her own family's involvement in the First World War, 
including her grandfather, a second lieutenant with the Middlesex 
Regiment.

She said: 'The idea behind it is that
 the land, No Man's Land, was fought over again and again with the front
 line moving very little, and the land got completely messed up and 
churned up.

As they entered the showroom where many celebrities bought plants to take home, the Queen was introduced to some of the women running stalls

'The concept is the healing of the land after severe conflict, and relating it to the human body and spirit.'

Plants used in the garden have been 
grown by injured soldiers at the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre 
at Headley Court as part of horticultural therapy.

The
 war in Afghanistan inspired first-time Chelsea designer Matthew 
Keightley to design the Hope on the Horizon garden for Help For 
Heroes,which charts the path to recovery for wounded personnel.

Mr
 Keightley's brother Michael serves with the RAF Regiment and is on his 
fifth tour of Afghanistan. On his last tour, he formed part of a medical
 evacuation crew, which led the designer to explore the recovery 
process.

Mr Keightley 
said of the experience of creating his first garden at Chelsea: 'It's 
the first time since being involved in team sport I've felt that feeling
 of camaraderie, not just with my own blokes but the greater community.'

The garden will be used to help service personnel at one of Help For Heroes recovery centres after Chelsea ends.

The
 scorching weekend had not been a problem for the garden, he said, as it
 had been designed for sunny weather - but he would be getting in to 
water it as soon as the judges had been round.

Many took to covering plants, particularly peonies and irises, in muslin to keep off the rays.

Others tied up their flowers and watered them repeatedly to stop them opening too early.

The baking temperatures left gardeners at the London show – which opens this week – more than a little hot under the collar.

Andrew
 Wilson, 55, who designed a wine-themed garden costing tens of thousands
 of pounds, said: ‘Last year it was freezing and this year it’s too hot.

'My irises have started to go over. I’ll have to substitute some of them with roses.’

Elizabetta
 Clementel, who has designed a garden for Country Life magazine, said 
she was worried about whether her Irises would hold out.

The 55-year-old, from Spain, added: ‘It’s a bit of a panic but we’ll do our best.’

Many designs 
are based on foreign horticulture: a Cleve West creation is inspired by 
ancient Persian gardens, and another exhibit looks like an Italian-style
 formal garden.

Organisers have this year celebrated a wave of new young talent.

TV presenter and gardener Dan Pearson picked 'nuturing potential' as the theme for his garden.

Having been discouraged from pursuing
 a career in horticulture as a youngster, he said he wants to encourage 
today's children to stick to their guns.

'The way to attract more young people
 into horticultural industries is for these careers to be seen as 
valuable and remunerated appropriately,' he urged.

But he said: 'This year it is 
noteworthy the number of young designers who are here. There are four of
 them at least under the age of 30, that's tremendously inspiring.'

Elsewhere at the show are dresses 
made of flowers, a garden that was being tended by Vikings and a 1914 
Potter's Garden, representing a rural potter going to war in France.

Amid the immaculate arrangement of 
blooms and endless horticultural varieties is one garden which 
celebrates a much more natural display - ancient woodlands.

The Woodland Trust 'Beauty Sleeping' 
garden takes visitors on a journey through an enclosed exhibit, complete
 with woodland plants, sounds and smells, which highlights the potential
 for restoring conifer plantations to their natural state as native 
woodland.

Woodland Trust chief executive Beccy 
Speight said: 'It's about a really threatened habitat, only 2% of the 
UK is ancient woodland, and quite a lot of that has been planted over 
with conifers.

'If you restore it in the right way, you get a fantastic resurgence of this kind of habitat.'
