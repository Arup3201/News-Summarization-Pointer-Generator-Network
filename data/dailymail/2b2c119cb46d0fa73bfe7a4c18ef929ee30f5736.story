A flight instructor falsified documents so a millionaire could get a helicopter licence - just weeks before the businessman and his wife did in a crash, a court heard today.

Inexperienced pilot Paul Spencer and his wife Linda died when their £250,000 black Gazelle helicopter crashed in woodland in the grounds of Rudding Park Hotel, near Harrogate, on January 26, 2008, where the couple owned a chalet.

Mr Spencer had obtained his licence only a month earlier after learning to fly with instructor Ian King, who appeared at Leeds Crown Court today.

King, 53, from, Wetherby, is accused of falsifying documents to have the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) grant a personal pilot’s licence to Mr Spencer on December 12, 2007.

Paul, 43, and Linda Spencer, 59, who ran a 
successful chain of craftware stores, died instantly when their 
helicopter crashed moments after taking off.

Martin Goudie, prosecuting, said documents found among Mr Spencer's personal possessions after his death revealed that he had not flown the correct amount of hours to achieve his licence.

Mr Goudie said Mr Spencer's logbook, which was verified by the instructor, stated he had completed more than 51 hours of training, including the required ten hours of solo flight.

However he said a personal flying sheet recorded a different set of hours, which would have left him unqualified to fly.

He told the court: 'It is this document, which the prosecution says records the correct amount of hours flown.

'When you look at the solo hours flown - which is one requirement of being able to gain a licence - according to Mr Spencer’s records the amount totals 8.6 hours rather than the minimum requirement of 10.'

The helicopter was also out of commission on a number of days when Mr Spencer was supposed to be training on it according to the official log submitted to the CAA by King in December 2007.

'That simply was a lie and he knew it was a lie and misled the Civil Aviation Authority to help Mr Spencer get his licence in quick time,' the prosecutor added.

Analysis of the businessman’s on-line activity and phone records showed he was making calls and dealing with emails at many times when he was supposed to be in the air, the court was told.

A Met Office expert was also used check the weather reports and found certain dates would have been unsuitable for flying, it was claimed.

It was also alleged fuel receipts were also checked and again mismatches were found.

The CAA only granted permission for Mr Spencer to begin his training on November 12 and King signed off on his pupil’s hours on December 5.

King is accused of falsifying documents weeks before the fatal crash in West Yorkshire in 2008

That left 'a very thin window of two to three weeks that the training was said to have taken place in,' Mr Goudie said.

Mr and Mrs Spencer ran Country Baskets, a business which sold dried flowers and were regular visitors to the Harrogate hotel.

They had made their home in a converted barn on the outskirts of Brighouse, West Yorkshire.

The £250,000 helicopter had previously been owned by DJ Neil Fox.

An Air Accident Investigation Board report into the tragedy concluded that the main contributing factors to the accident were 'the pilot’s lack of experience and probable inadequacies in his training.'

King denies making false representations to procure a pilot’s licence.

The trial continues tomorrow.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
