Along a corridor inside Villa Park, Manuel Pellegrini knew what was coming. Did Yaya Toure’s stunningly graceful opener indicate the summer of discontent was finally over and he is back to his best?

The Manchester City manager is very adept at handling situations like this. Not too high after a victory, never too low in defeat. After Toure’s shenanigans with birthday cakes and seemingly wanting out in pre-season, the manager’s stance is wise.

‘I don’t want to focus on all the things Yaya did,’ was the response from Pellegrini, who claims the summer engineering from Toure’s agent Dimitri Seluk to get him out of the club was all a misunderstanding. 

Yaya Toure's form has been under scrutiny but Manuel Pellegrini has thrown his support behind his player

‘I support him in the good games and in the bad games. I trust what he can do. I speak with him every day. I know what he thinks and know the way he works.

‘He was working in the perfect way. He always criticises himself on when he is going to return to his normal performance.

‘When I see the players work every day I know about their commitment to the project or not. I have a squad I can manage with different names but for the whole squad the commitment is very important. In this squad I don’t have any problem with any player.’

Although Toure’s goal was brilliant, he was generally poor on Saturday. The Ivorian gave possession away needlessly throughout — one particular 10-yard pass flew out of play — and his final ball was often ill-judged.

This is nothing new for Pellegrini. As he alluded to after this win, the champions had to put up with Toure’s infuriating performances last season, only for them to be forgotten after a classy swish of a boot and the 20 goals it brought.

‘If they want to, they (the critics) can continue,’ was Toure’s retort. ‘Sometimes people forget that I’m a midfielder and my job is not to score goals all the time.’

There is no doubting that Toure is one of — if not the — best central midfielder in the Premier League. But here he only really played for 15 minutes. City need something extra, more consistent. Pablo Zabaleta indicated as much.

‘We need him back to his best form in terms of passing, even free-kicks,’ the Argentine said. ‘We are 100 per cent sure we will see the best of Yaya soon. He’s been OK for us and he knows how important he is for that team.

‘If he is on his best form, Yaya can do whatever he wants because he’s just different class. We are at our best when Yaya is at his best.’ 

Despite his goal, Toure wasn't at his best for Manchester City against Aston Villa

City were at their most fluent against Paul Lambert’s side when Pellegrini opted to replace Edin Dzeko with Fernando and play three in midfield. Toure could then breathe and made the difference.

But while that tactical manoeuvre swung the contest, Pellegrini is insistent on persisting with two up front — even in the Champions League.

Roma sussed them out comfortably last week and City have come under increasing scrutiny in Europe for not being able to adapt to different propositions — particularly this time last year when they were humbled by Pep Guardiola’s Bayern Munich.

‘I repeat that for me it isn’t a tactical problem,’ the Chilean added. ‘We have a lot of statistics on games when we play with two and how many we play with one. The most amount of games that we win is with two strikers and four midfielders.

‘We can make changes — it is important to do it. I can’t always speak about a game we played against Bayern Munich one year ago. We played 70 games and didn’t have any problem, except that match because we played very badly with two strikers.'

Though the Ivorian broke his goal duck for the season, his performance was far from convincing or anywhere near the midfielder's lofty expectations
