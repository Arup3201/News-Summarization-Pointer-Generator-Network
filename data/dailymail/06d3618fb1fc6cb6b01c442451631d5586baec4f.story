It is a scheme that even King Joffrey might find too cruel but one maths teacher has come up with a way of controlling unruly pupils - by threatening to reveal which characters die on Game Of Thrones.

Fans of the hit HBO series have spent months trying to avoid any spoilers ahead of the fourth series, including the class of children at a Belgian school.

But when the youngsters became too rowdy their maths teacher hit upon a dastardly plan which could rival any dreamed up by Tyrion Lannister.

Plot: The teacher asked his class students which of them watched the series, based on the A Song Of Ice And Fire novels by author George M. Martin

According to Belgian newspaper Nieuwsblad, the teacher asked his class of 70 students which of them watched the epic fantasy series, based on the A Song Of Ice And Fire novels by author George M. Martin.

When around three-quarters of the pupils raised their hands, the teacher, who has not been identified, replied: 'Well I've read all the books. If there's too much noise I will write the names of the dead on the board.

'They are enough to fill the whole year and I can even describe how they die.'

Return: The series, starring Emilia Clarke (pictured), returns in the US on April 6, and will air in the UK on Sky Atlantic the following day

Series: Taking inspiration from ancient myths as well as historic events, the show centres on the struggle for power between a number of families in the mainland of Westeros

Some giggling pupils reportedly then decided to put their teacher's threat to the test, only for him to begin writing out the names of every character killed at the end of the third series on his board 'for those who had not seen it'.

According to a post believed to have been written by a pupil on French website Dans Ton Chat: 'There was a religious silence for the last hour of the lesson'.

The pupil described his teacher as a 'genius'.

Since Game Of Thrones first aired in 2011 it has attracted legions of fans from across the globe, and has become known for its graphic violence, frequent sex scenes, shocking plot twists - and lack of sentimentality when it comes to killing off lead characters.
