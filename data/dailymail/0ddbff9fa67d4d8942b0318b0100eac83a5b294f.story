For under $4million, a private island home off the coast of Connecticut can be yours along with the chance to discover a chest full of pirate's gold rumored to be buried underneath.

One of history's most infamous swashbucklers, Captain Kidd, is said to have stashed a hefty treasure somewhere in the chain of rocky Thimble Islands in the Long Island Sound as he fled 17th century pirate hunters.

If the 1-acre Belden Island happens to be where Kidd's X marked the spot, then the $3.95million asking price is nothing short of a steal.

Gold in them thar islands: Belden Island is one of the Thimble Islands off the coast of Branford, Connecticut. Infamous pirate Captain Kidd is said to have stashed some of his treasure on one of the islands in the late 17th century

A steal: Belden Island, complete with its 4-bedroom, 100-year-old cottage is on sale for $3.95 million

The seven room cottage was built in 1912 and remains almost perfectly preserved, with floor-to-ceiling wainscoting that lends a maritime feel that would make Captain Kidd himself feel right at home.

The cottage is designed in the colonial style and features a wraparound porch with stunning 360-degree water views.

The island's current owner, Christine Svenningsen, purchased Belden as part of her late-90s and early 2000s buy up of nine islands in the Thimble chain.

Svenningsen paid $2.66 million for Belden Island in 2006, reports Curbed.

Verdant: Belden's 7-room summer cottage even has its own manicured lawn, making any suburban-dwelling treasure enthusiast feel right at home

Shiver me checkbook: A fanciful painting by Howard Pyle shows Kidd and his men burying a hefty treasure. Could it be beneath the cottage on Belden Island? Only $3.95 million will let you find out

Captain William Kidd was born around 1645, the callous corsair was a clergyman's son from Greenock, near Glasgow, who moved to New York for adventure.

He started his seagoing career as a privateer - a mercenary licensed by William III to hunt Britain's enemies, usually the French or Spanish.

The Crown was supposed to get ten per cent of privateers' plunder, but Kidd often kept all his loot.

In 1695 he left London in the Adventure Galley, a 284-tonner with a crew of 150 and 34 cannon.

Late in 1696, he attacked a British East India Company convoy and was declared a pirate.

In 1698, he took his greatest prize, the Quedah Merchant. A 400-ton Moorish trader from Armenia, it was loaded with gold, silver and fine silks. The Adventure Galley was by now rotting and leaky.

So he scuttled her, renamed the Quedah Merchant the Adventure Prize, and sailed for the Caribbean.

Kidd then went north in a sloop. Sometime in 1699, the legend of the Connecticut treasure was born as Kidd arrived in the Long Island Sound, the location of the Thimble Islands.

Here, he is said to have buried his considerable treasure while avoiding capture.

That summer, his one-time backer, the Earl of Bellomont, lured him to Boston and Kidd was captured.

After a trial said to have lasted just a single day, Kidd was found guilty of murder and piracy.

On May 23, 1701, Kidd was hanged and the secret of his treasure's exact location in the Thimble Islands died along with him.

Antique: The perfectly preserved cottage was built in 1912 and features original wainscoting throughout

Homey: The all-wood interior gives the four-bedroom summer cottage a maritime feel that would make Captain Kidd himself feel right at home

Scenic: The colonial-style cottage has a wrap-around porch and 360-degree views of Long Island Sound. In the background, the city of Branford, Connecticut can be seen

At some point in the cottage's 100-plus year existence, a professionally manicured lawn was installed, so even the most suburban of homeowners will feel comfortable.

There is also a small sand beach and an expansive, rocky shore along with a new dock.

The cottage has gas fireplaces and vintage gas lighting and water is pumped in from the nearby city of Branford, Connecticut.

Heating for the four-bedroom vacation home is provided by a coal/wood stove and propane.

Potential buyers should note that a boat for traveling to and from the island is not included. And to interested treasure seekers: neither is a shovel.

The full listing of the island and cottage can be seen here.

Roomy: The manicured lawn opens up onto expansive rock beaches and a small sand beach. All told, the island is just over 1 acre

Some strings attached: The home includes a new dock, but boat and treasure-hunting shovels are not included

Lovely - so much nicer than the one in the news the other day, great cosy interior. Better area, closer to the mainland and yes it says new dock, but if you got that sort of money you could have a boat and a sea-plane to go island hopping.............dream over.

No boat dock! This place would be a MAJOR PAIN to live in.

Looks quite nice, but I'd be worried about bad weather.

Not really what I would describe as a 'tiny' property!
