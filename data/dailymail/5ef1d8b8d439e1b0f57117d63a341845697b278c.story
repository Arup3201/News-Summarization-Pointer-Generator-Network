An Islamic State plot for sword-wielding fanatics to behead victims selected at random on the streets has been thwarted by police in Australia.

The plot – with chilling echoes of the murder of soldier Lee Rigby, who was hacked to death on a London street last year by two Muslim converts – was foiled in a series of anti-terror raids across Sydney.

Some 800 heavily armed officers arrested 15 suspected IS supporters and seized an Islamic sword, a dagger and guns.

Federal Police arrested 15 people after it emerged at least 60 Australians are fighting for ISIS in Syria and Iraq

Intelligence from telephone intercepts indicated a senior IS leader had ordered the group’s supporters to carry out the attacks, picking victims at random, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott revealed.

‘The exhortations – quite direct exhortations – were coming from an Australian who is apparently quite senior in IS to networks of support back in Australia to conduct demonstration killings here in this country,’ he said.

At least 60 Australians are said to be fighting for IS in Syria and Iraq, with at least 15 having been killed.

Mr Abbott has sent 600 troops to the Middle East, together with warplanes to be on stand-by to attack the jihadis. Last month there was international shock and disgust when a seven-year-old boy, raised in the suburbs of Sydney, was shown in Syria holding a severed head.

The raids came days after Australia raised its terrorism threat to the second-highest level in response to the domestic threat posed by IS supporters.

Attorney General George Brandis confirmed that a person born in Afghanistan who had spent time in Australia and is now working with IS in the Middle East ordered supporters in Australia to behead people and videotape the executions.

‘If the... police had not acted, there is a likelihood that this would have happened,’ Mr Brandis said.

Mr Abbott added: ‘This is not just suspicion, this is intent and that’s why the police and security agencies decided to act in the way they have.’

Among the weapons recovered from the suspected terrorists is this military-style survival knife 

The suspects have been taken into custody while their terrorist connections are fully investigated 

Court documents named the mastermind of the attack as Mohammad Ali Baryalei, 33, a former nightclub bouncer, who is believed to be Australia’s most senior IS member.

Omarjan Azari, 22, one of those held, appeared briefly in court hours after his arrest.

Prosecutor Michael Allnutt said Azari was involved in a plan to ‘gruesomely’ kill a randomly selected person – something that was ‘clearly designed to shock and horrify’ the public.

That plan involved an ‘unusual level of fanaticism’, he said. Azari is charged with conspiracy to prepare for a terrorist attack. In court documents, Azari was accused of conspiring with Baryalei and others between May and September.

Mr Allnutt said the charge stemmed from the interception of a phone call days earlier. Azari will appear in court again in November.

Dozens of police spent yesterday searching Azari’s house and a car parked across the street.

Australian Security Intelligence Organisation director-general David Irvine said the threat of terrorism in the country had been rising over the past year, mainly due to Australians joining IS to fight in Syria and Iraq.

‘Police believe that this group that we have executed this operation on today had the intention and had started to carry out planning to commit violent acts here in Australia,’ said Federal Police Deputy Commissioner Andrew Colvin.

‘Those violent acts particularly related to random acts against members of the public.’

Terror raids were conducted in the cities of Brisbane and Logan in Queensland yesterday in a follow-up to operations carried out last week. Then, police arrested two men in Brisbane for allegedly preparing to fight in Syria, recruiting jihadis and raising money for the Al Qaeda offshoot group Jabhat al-Nusra, also known as the Nusra Front.

Police said the operations in Sydney and Brisbane – venue for the G20 summit of world leaders in November – were linked, but declined to release details.
