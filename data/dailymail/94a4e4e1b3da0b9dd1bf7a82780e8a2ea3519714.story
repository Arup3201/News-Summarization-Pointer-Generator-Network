The Cleveland police union's president has branded an NFL player's silent protest against recent fatal Ohio police shootings 'pathetic'.  

Cleveland Browns receiver Andrew Hawkins wore a 'Justice for Tamir Rice and John Crawford' T-shirt over his pads during warm-ups before the game against the Cincinnati Bengals yesterday.

Tamar, a 12-year-old who was playing with a pellet gun, was shot by a Cleveland police officer at a park on November 22 and died the following day.

In August, cops shot dead John Crawford III, 22, who had a BB gun, at a Beavercreek Walmart just outside of Dayton.

Hawkins' actions provoked Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Association President Jeffrey Follmer, who attacked players who bring political issues onto the field.

'He's disrespecting the police on a job that we had to do and make a split-second decision,' he told Cleveland.com.

In a statement, Mr Follmer said: 'It's pretty pathetic when athletes think they know the law.

'They should stick to what they know best on the field. 

'The Cleveland Police protect and serve the Browns stadium and the Browns organization owes us an apology.'

The Browns responded to Mr Follmer with a statement saying they respect the police, but also the right of players to support whichever cause they choose, according to Cleveland.com.

It said: 'We have great respect for the Cleveland Police Department and the work that they do to protect and serve our city. 

'We also respect our players' rights to project their support and bring awareness to issues that are important to them if done so in a responsible manner.' 

Police had responded to the scene of Tamir Rice's shooting after a 911 call warned of someone pointing a pistol, which turned out to be fake. 

Officer Timothy Loehmann shot him two seconds after arriving to  investigate, but police allege the rookie cop had told the boy to put his hands up, but he had reached for the gun in his waistband instead. 

An autopsy found he died from a single shot to the abdomen in what has now been ruled a homicide. 

A grand jury will consider whether charges against Loehmann are merited.

This is not the first time a Browns player taking a stand against police violence.

Recently, defensive end Johnson Bademosi wore an 'I Can't Breathe' T-shirt protesting the death of Eric Garner at the hands of a police officer who held him in an apparent chokehold.

He then penned an editorial on his decision on a Sports Illustrated blog.

And earlier this month, LeBron James and several Brooklyn Nets players wore 'I Can't Breathe' shirts as they warmed up for a game against the Cleveland Cavaliers.

It comes after months of tension between the black community and the police after a series of fatal incidents, including the shooting of unarmed Michael Brown by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in August.
