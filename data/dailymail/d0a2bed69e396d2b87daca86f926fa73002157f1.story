An Ohio town leader has rejected claims from a lesbian mother embroiled in a lawsuit with a sperm bank that their biracial baby is unwelcome in his community.

John Arnold, a trustee of Lake Township, was referring to Payton, the two-year-old daughter of Jennifer Cramblett who is suing a Chicago sperm bank alleging she was wrongly impregnated with a black man's sperm. 

As part of the lawsuit, she has complained that Uniontown, where the family live, is 'racially intolerant' and has forced her to consider moving elsewhere to protect the child's well-being. 

However Arnold, told NBC News: 'There's no reason anyone would act that way to a two-year-old. I could not fathom it.'

Census data shows Uniontown is 98 percent white, but Arnold said the community welcomes diversity. 

Mr Arnold added: 'We have a large Mennonite community and a lot of the members have adopted African-American children and babies from all over the world and those kids have been treated fine.

'They obviously have a beautiful, healthy two-year-old. I hope that their perception of how they might be treated in Uniontown is not the reality.' 

Ms Cramblett's lawyer, Thomas Intili, told NBC that the mother and child have already experienced prejudice.

He said: 'Not all of it is overt. Some of it is the looks on people's faces. Lines of communication once open to her from friends and families are diminishing.' 

Ms Cramblett is suing Chicago-based Midwest Sperm Bank for allegedly sending her the wrong sperm samples after a receptionist transposed a number on the paperwork. Donor 380, the sperm donor Ms Cramblett and Ms Zinkon had picked to father their child, was a blonde-haired, blue-eyed white man. She was sent vials of sperm from donor 330, a black man.

'I am happy that I have a healthy child,' Cramblett told NBC News through tears.  

Ms Cramblett says in the lawsuit that Payton has been stigmatized by residents in the community, forcing her to consider moving elsewhere in order to protect her 'well-being'

'But I'm not going to let them get away with not being held accountable.' 

In a lawsuit filed this week in Cook County, Illinois, Ms Cramblett says Midwest Sperm Bank sent her several vials of a black man's sperm by mistake because the clinic keeps paper records and accidentally transposed numbers on her order. 

Midwest Sperm Bank charged $400 per vial of semen and Ms Cramblett and her partner received six vials of the wrong semen. 

The lawsuit says the clinic later sent Ms Cramblett an apology note and a refund for the six vials - though charged her for the vials of the correct semen she received.

Ms Cramblett she has 'limited cultural competency relative to African-Americans' and worries that her daughter Payton will not be accepted in her hometown of Uniontown. 

'Jennifer lives each day with fears, anxieties and uncertainty about her future and Payton's future,' according to the lawsuit. 

Ms Cramblett, the assistant manager of an AT&T store, said she and her partner Amanda Zinkon love their daughter, who is now two years old, but say they must now consider moving to a more diverse community.

Ms Cramblett says her family is racist and has not fully accepted her sexuality. Having a mixed-race daughter makes it even harder, she claims in her lawsuit

Ms Cramblett says she's thankful she had a healthy daughter, but she says even simple tasks like getting Payton's hair cut can be dau

Ms Cramblett says in her lawsuit that much of her family is racist and that one uncle openly makes racist comments.  

Even simple tasks have become more complicated because Payton is mixed-race, the lawsuit says. 

'Payton has hair typical of an African American girl. To get a decent cut, Jennifer must travel to a black neighborhood, far from where she lives, where she is obviously different in appearance, and not overtly welcome,' according to the lawsuit.

Ms Cramblett says she grew up in Scio, Ohio - population 762 - and didn't meet a black person until she attended college. She currently lives in Uniontown, population 2,802, and fears Payton will be the only non-white child in class when the time comes for her to attend school.

Ms Cramblett says her family has difficulty accepting the fact that she is gay and encourage her to hide her sexual orientation when she is around them. 

She says no matter what she does, Payton cannot hide her race - nor should she have to. 

Ms Cramblett is alleging breach of warranty and wrongful birth.

Midwest Sperm Bank would not comment on the case.
