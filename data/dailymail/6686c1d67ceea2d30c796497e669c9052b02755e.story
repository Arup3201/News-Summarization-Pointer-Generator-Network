Dallas Seavey ran a blistering pace and took the lead just hours before the finish to win this year's Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

Seavey was the first musher under the famed burled arch in Nome. Minutes later, second place finisher Aliy Zirkle finished amid cheers.

He had to come from a three-hour deficient to overcome mushers Jeff King and Zirkle in the last 77 miles. He was third into the second-to-last checkpoint in White Mountain, where mushers are required to take an eight-hour rest.

Zirkle also finished second in 2012 and 2013.

Seavey holds the record for being the youngest champion ever; he was 25 when he won in 2012.

Seavey comes from a mushing family. His grandfather, Dan Seavey, helped organize the first Iditarod in 1973.

His
 father, Mitch Seavey, has twice won the nearly thousand-mile race 
across Alaska. Mitch won in 2006 and last year became the race's oldest 
champion at age 53.

Dallas Seavey was also a champion wrestler. In 2003, he became Alaska's first ever junior champion, winning the 125-pound title.

He's also a participant on the reality television series 'Ultimate Survival Alaska.'

Seavey
 admits he's somewhat of a hermit, and doesn't own a television. The 
only time he sees an episode of the show is when he downloads it on his 
computer.

'I don't leave my training compound if I can help it,' said Seavey. 'If I leave, it's by dog team, not by vehicle.'

The trail this year has been marked by poor conditions because of a lack of snow after a warm winter by Alaska standards.

A
 number of mushers were injured at the beginning of the race as their 
sleds ran on gravel near the Dalzell Gorge.

One musher, Scott Janssen of
 Anchorage, had to be rescued by a National Guard helicopter crew after 
breaking an ankle.

Snowless conditions again greeted mushers as they reached the western coast of the nation's largest state.

The
 race began March 2 in Willow with 69 teams. As of Monday morning, 15 
mushers had dropped out and one was withdrawn, leaving 53 teams on the 
trail.

The Iditarod winner 
receives $50,000 and a new truck. The 29 teams after that get cash 
prizes decreasing on a sliding scale. All other teams finishing the race
 receive $1,049.

John Baker 
holds the fastest finish in Iditarod history, covering the trail from 
Anchorage to Nome in eight days, 18 hours and 46 minutes in 2011.
