A Florida woman's Coast Guard boot-camp commander forced her to scrub his office on her hands and knees and ordered another recruit to strip and have sex with him, she has revealed.

Elisha Morrow, from Boyton Beach, and three other young recruits were subject to extreme sexual harassment at a boot camp in Cape May, New Jersey, after Chief Petty Officer Carlos Resendez selected them for 'house mouse' duty in 2009 and 2010.

She said Resendez, who also taught training classes to quash sexual harassment, would order the women - all blonde, around 5 feet 3 inches tall and in their early 20s - to one at a time scrub his office late at night while he stood over them commenting on their bodies.

Lobbying: Elisha Morrow, from Boyton Beach, left with U.S. Rep Lois Frankel, is in Washington pushing for new laws after she and three other young recruits were subject to extreme sexual harassment at a boot camp in Cape May, New Jersey

Now Morrow is taking her experiences to Washington, where she is pushing to make it easier to prosecute military commanders who victimize the men and women under their control.

A provision inspired by the now-26-year-old's story has passed the U.S. House and it's expected to clear the Senate today.

'I think all members of Congress need to get on board with this and say, "We're not going to allow this to happen to our troops,"' Morrow, now a police dispatcher in Palm Beach Gardens, told the Sun Sentinel. 'I'm not sure they are all quite there yet.'

Resendez was sent to military prison for a year on charges of maltreating subordinates and adultery.

Morrow said she thought about faking a suicide attempt to get away from him while the harrassment was going on.

'He haunts your person by day and your dreams at night,' she said, describing the impact of the treatment.

Speaking out: Elisha Morrow, pictured left in April, and Tiffany Berkland, right, were sexually harassed by the same company commander when they were in basic training after joining the Coast Guard

She and another victim, Tiffany 
Berkland, did not immediately report the harassment for fear of being 
kicked out of the Coast Guard but came forward when they met a third 
victim.

When their case went to trial, they met a fourth young woman who had been raped recently by the same company commander.

Morrow
 testified in the investigation that led to the court martial, however 
felt guilty, particularly for the woman who he forced to have sex with 
him, that she didn't come forward sooner.

'I had to tell her I was sorry that I hadn't reported that this had happened,' she told the Sentinel. 'That's why I'm pushing so hard for this (legislation).'

Prosecutors could not pursue more serious sexual assault charges against the commander because military law requires proof of physical or life-threatening harm to the victim.

Angered, Morrow took her story to the
 Democratic Representative for Palm Beach Lois Frankel, who proposed 
legislation that was added to a major defense bill, the Sentinel 
reports.

Scene: The harassment occurred at Coast Guard Training Center at Cape May, New Jersey, where Commanders are seen conducting basic training techniques

The bill directs a military tribunal to redefine sexual assault in the military realm. Florida Democratic Senator Bill Nelson introduced the same provision in the Senate.

'From my point of view as the mother of a Marine war veteran, what struck me is that our sons and daughters put their military uniforms on to protect us. So we must do all we can to protect them,' Frankel told the newspaper.

The bill also reportedly contains provisions to block military commanders from overturning jury convictions and to require a civilian review if a commander declines to prosecute a case.

Morrow believes it is a good first step but more needs to be done.

'These people, they get a slap on the wrist and they are discharged,' she explained. 'And then they end up being people's neighbors. They end up being in the community. They are not registered sex offenders, and people around them are none the wiser about what kind of history they have had.

'Until they resolve it and handle it properly, this is not going to go away.'
