A weight loss guru has blamed Homer Simpson for Britain’s obesity crisis by claiming the cartoon character's love of donuts and beer encourages unhealthy eating habits.

Steve Miller, who presented TV show Fat Families, believes Homer’s appetite for junk food is sending out the wrong message that unhealthy eating makes you happy.

He has now written to the show’s creator, Matt Groening, urging him to put the cartoon character on a ‘realistic’ healthy eating plan in an attempt to slim him down.

Mr Miller, who has worked with overweight families for the last eight years, said: ‘When I see cartoon characters and any promotion at all in the media that says you can be fat and happy and eat as much as you want, I will raise my concerns strongly.

‘I don’t want people seeing Homer Simpson being fat, stuffing food in and being happy. What we should be doing is elevating the promotion of people who are happy and slim.

‘The reason I decided to write to him [Matt Groening] is because I want to see Homer take up a realistic regime where he is determined to be fit, healthy and happy rather than fat and happy.

‘Because that’s the message I want to get to the nation. It’s about giving children - our next generation - the right message.

‘Being fat and happy don’t go hand-in-hand because you are potentially putting yourself in danger.’

Mr Miller, who once lost four stone himself, said he believes Homer should be put on his 80/20 eating plan – where you eat healthily 80 per cent of the time and have ‘what you fancy’ the other 20 per cent.

He said: ‘When it comes to role models, anyone in the media that’s fat needs to really think about it because it’s sending out the wrong message.

‘I am very anti size acceptance because we have to remember that being too fat can lead to significant health problems, including diabetes and cancer.

‘I would love to see Homer go on a health regime that doesn't mean he cuts out everything, but he lives my by 80/20 rule.

‘You eat well 80 per cent of the time and can have a bit of what you fancy the remaining 20 per cent of the week, but you watch the portion size.

‘As somebody who works full-time with fat people helping them to lose weight, it works really well.

‘I’d love to see Homer take back control over food. Because millions of people around the world watch the programme it would be such an inspirational message, especially to young people, that actually you can be fit and happy.

‘I'm not saying lets get Homer on a ridiculous diet, lets do it realistically. The message it would put out would be fantastic.’

Mr Miller, a hypnotherapist, also said he would like to see Mr Groening put the cartoon character in hypnotherapy sessions to help him achieve weight loss.

He added: ‘I would love to see him hypnotised to lose weight, I'm even willing to hypnotise him.

‘I always say: “It’s about getting mind over platter.”'
