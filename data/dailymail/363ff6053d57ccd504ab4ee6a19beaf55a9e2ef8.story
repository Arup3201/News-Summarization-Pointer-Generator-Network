Senior figures at Oxford University have warned that the prestigious institution could undermine its own reputation by relaxing admission standards for foreign students.

Students from the U.S. and elsewhere are paying as much as £40,000 a year to study at Oxford for up to a year.

But they do not have to show the same level of academic ability as most undergraduates - and an internal report has voiced fears that the admissions are threatening the university.

Prestigious: But Oxford is threatened by lower-quality students from overseas, according to a report

Concerns centre around 'associate students', who are typically undergraduates at American universities who spend between a term and a year studying at Oxford.

They do not officially become members of the university, but are admitted to one of the 38 colleges, which have complete control over their own admission policies.

An internal report revealed by the Daily Telegraph warned that associate students 'pose severe reputational risk' to the university, arguing that their standards are 'often low' and claiming they are usually accepted on 'purely commercial' grounds.

Most such students do not apply directly to the college, but are accepted via a commercial company which takes a cut of their fees.

The largest such company is apparently the Washington International Studies Council, which charges $20,900 (£13,400) per term.

The firm places students with a number of colleges, including historic institutions such as Magdalen, Christ Church and New College, which receive around £4,000 per student per term.

Danger: Officials are concerned that Oxford colleges are charging high fees to under-qualified students

On its website, WISC says that its students cannot get an Oxford degree, but insists they enjoy the same level of teaching as normal undergraduates.

It also states that 'admission is always entirely the responsibility of the Oxford college' - but according to the university's internal report, they do not have to undergo rigorous checks of their academic qualifications.

'Although there is some assessment of their GPA [Grade Point Average] scores before they are admitted by each college, the transaction seems to be one of a purely commercial kind,' the report said.

The document expressed concern that employers and members of the public would not understand the difference between a full Oxford degree and a year spent studying at the university.

However, it admitted that the university had benefited from millions of pounds in fees paid by associate students for access to the Bodleian Library.

A spokesman for the university said: 'Associate members (formerly known as "associate students") pay a fee to use college facilities for a term. This is a way for colleges to make their facilities more widely available while earning income.

'Associate members are not Oxford University students and do not take up student places. They do not receive teaching and do not gain an Oxford qualification. All this is made clear upfront.'

Alumni: David Cameron and Ed Miliband are among the many public figures to have studied at Oxford

Oxford, whose alumni include hundreds of
public figures such as David Cameron, Ed Miliband, Stephen Hawking and 
Philip Pullman, has long had a tradition of attracting students from 
overseas.

The elite Rhodes Scholarships are 
considered one of the most prestigious academic awards in the world, 
with past scholars including Bill Clinton and U.S. National Security 
Adviser Susan Rice.

In addition, the university admits hundreds of fully-fledged foreign undergraduates, and insists that they are held to the same standards as British students.

UK universities have come under fire in recent weeks for allegedly treating overseas students as 'cash cows', charging them up to £35,000 a year compared to a maximum of £9,000 for British undergraduates.

Oxford and Cambridge are believed to have turned down more than 25,000 British applicants this year, nearly all of whom were predicted to get at least three A grades in their A-levels.

Alastair Herron, from Northern Ireland, achieved seven A*s earlier this month, but was rejected by Oxford and is now heading to Stanford University in California.

The pressure on places at good universities is so great that one straight-A student, Miriam Bourne, is considering moving to Romania to study medicine after being turned down by everywhere she applied in the UK.
