How many Government schools inspectors would approve of a half-naked teacher who instructed his pupils in the finer points of anarchic terrorism?

That was the approach taken by Jim Cogan, an English teacher at my old school, Westminster, in the Eighties.

Mr Cogan, who had done his National Service in Nigeria with the West African Frontier Force, liked to teach outside, often stripped to his vest.

Privileged: Harry Mount claims Nick Clegg, who attended Westminster school in the 1980s, owes his success to his teachers, most of whom had no formal teaching qualification

On sunny summer days, he marched the class to the boundary of the cricket pitch in nearby Vincent Square, asking pupils to compose an instant essay on ‘How cricket is like life’.

Cogan was a Shakespeare scholar, expert at guiding pupils towards Oxbridge with his vast memory bank of quotes from English literature.

At the same time, he told his pupils that all Oxbridge colleges should be blown up, to end the wicked class divide.

If Jim Cogan’s old pupil, Nick Clegg, had his way, this maverick genius wouldn’t have been allowed to give 35 years of his life to inspiring Westminster pupils.

Mr Cogan studied classics and English at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, but he never got the formal teaching qualification Clegg insists all teachers at free schools must have.

Barely any of the gifted teachers who taught me and Nick Clegg — I was four years below the Deputy Prime Minister — had a teaching qualification. As a result, our elite education was blissfully free from the blunt, oafish, centralised government intervention Clegg is demanding for less privileged children.

Nick Clegg wasn’t one of the more intelligent boys when he was at Westminster School from 1980 to 1985.

'He was a genius who taught for the love of his subject'

The clever pupils at Westminster — one of the best, and most expensive, schools in the country, costing £32,490 a year — were ‘accelerated’. That meant they did O-levels after two, as opposed to three, years.

Clegg, one of the less bright sparks, was selected for the three-year option. Still, that didn’t stop him making it into Robinson College, Cambridge, in 1986, and, from there, on to the smooth-running conveyor belt to life’s glittering prizes: a scholarship at Minnesota University, an MA at the College of Europe in Bruges, a job with the European Commission and a spell as an MEP, before becoming an MP.

None of this would have been possible without the rocket-boosters attached to his middle-ranking talents by Westminster’s teachers.

I was largely taught by the same teachers — they stayed at the school a long time, attracted by the freedom to teach in the way they wanted, not hamstrung by the foot-dragging, equality-obsessed, knowledge-hating forces of the State education machine.

They taught for the love of their subject and were restricted neither by any national curriculum — which Clegg is also insisting all free school teachers must follow — nor much of a school curriculum. That day’s topic could be changed on the spot.

Mount says new rules would drive free-thinking, inspirational teachers away from state schools and into private ones such as Westminster (pictured)

I remember the assassination of Indira Gandhi, India’s Prime Minister, in October 1984.

I was 13, in my first term, and our English teacher, David Edwards, decided on a whim to devote the lesson to studying her legacy rather than reading Julius Caesar, our O-level set book.

Of course, we’d end up reading Julius Caesar and doing well in those exams, but only as a sideshow in the general mission to enjoy literature; not as the be-all and end-all of the two years of lessons — or, in Clegg’s case, three years — leading to our O-levels.

The teachers used a deft combination of carrot and stick. David Hepburne-Scott — an Old Etonian who taught physics to me and Clegg and was rarely seen without his Eton tie — could be terrifying. But his  lessons were wonderfully original.

He taught the physics of heat transfer by telling us that, to warm up a cold bottle of red wine quickly before a dinner party, we must stick it behind the fridge — where warm air is expelled.

In the same lesson that he taught us Bernoulli’s principle — which explains why aeroplanes fly — he also told us how to fold our jackets before putting them in a suitcase: turn one arm inside out, fold once vertically, then again horizontally.

I still do it today on holiday — and I remember Bernoulli’s principle, too.

Hepburne-Scott also had an uplifting disregard for petty rules. On a trip to a railway museum, he jumped into the cab of a stationary locomotive, beckoned a group of boys aboard, and headed, steaming, off into the sunset.

'My other maths teacher, Tristram Jones-Parry, a planet-brained mathematician, tried to teach at a State school when he left Westminster and was denied a job because he wasn't 'qualified"'

My maths teacher, Michael Hugill, taught statistics by comparing the length of words used by the novelists Anthony Powell and Evelyn Waugh in 100-word extracts from their books.

Tellingly, my other maths teacher, Tristram Jones-Parry, a planet-brained mathematician, later the headmaster, tried to teach at a State school when he left Westminster — and was denied a job because he wasn’t ‘qualified’.

His old pupil, Nick Clegg, must have been delighted.

Jones-Parry was formidable figure. He once bellowed at the young Helena Bonham Carter, who took her A-levels at Westminster: ‘You can’t dress up as if you’re about to go out and milk the cows!’

Richard Stokes, Clegg’s German teacher — last year awarded the Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany for ‘great service rendered to British-German relations’ — taught his subject through German poems set to music by Schubert and Mozart.

Stokes was another ‘untrained’ but inspirational man who admitted that while at Oxford, he’d get one of the girls from Somerville College to check his translations which were always littered with ‘howlers’.

Of course, Westminster in the Clegg years wasn’t a sepia-tinted paradise, with a common room entirely populated by adored Mr Chips types. As in any school, some of the teachers weren’t much good.

Free schools, like private schools, currently don't require teachers to take a formal qualification before joining the staff

And it helped that the pupils were from comfortable, middle-class backgrounds, often with book-lined drawing rooms at home. It helped, too, that practically all the teachers had been to Oxbridge.

Still, that doesn’t mean less privileged children wouldn’t benefit from the teaching techniques that sent droves of Westminster pupils to Oxbridge and professional careers.

Wicked, patronising critics insist State schools can’t follow the same methods that make private schools the best in the world.

'Talented, free-thinking, unqualified teachers will desert free schools and flock to private ones.'

And Nick Clegg isn’t alone in denying poor children the advantages he benefited from by an accident of birth.

Shadow Education Secretary Tristram Hunt — son of a peer, educated at fee-paying University College School and Trinity College, Cambridge — insists teachers must have qualifications, even though he has taught in schools in his Stoke constituency without one himself.

Clegg and Hunt come from a long line of privately educated, Left-wing politicians, who pull up the drawbridge behind them.

Shirley Williams, Education Secretary under James Callaghan, was beautifully educated at St Paul’s Girls’ School and Somerville College, Oxford, but was determined to get rid of private and grammar schools.

Anthony Crosland (Highgate School and Trinity College, Oxford), Harold Wilson’s Education Secretary, famously said: ‘If it’s the last thing I do, I’m going to destroy every f***ing grammar school in England. And Wales and Northern Ireland.’

Who wouldn’t want to be free of their hypocritical grasp?

The idea behind Michael Gove’s free schools is they should be  free, if not entirely independent, of the dead hand of Government.

But Nick Clegg is trying to keep a Government grip on them, keep them attached to what Michael Gove calls ‘the blob’ — the immovable, stodgy mass of the State-education establishment.

The result? Talented, free-thinking, unqualified teachers will desert free schools and flock to private ones.

Westminster’s teachers were brilliant because they were free from State indoctrination, free from a Government curriculum, free from the dim limitations of groupthink.

Free, too, to scream at, expel or suspend anyone they wanted. And they haven’t been on strike in 453 years.

Harry Mount is a tutor and teaches architectural history at a London art school. He doesn’t have a teaching qualification.
