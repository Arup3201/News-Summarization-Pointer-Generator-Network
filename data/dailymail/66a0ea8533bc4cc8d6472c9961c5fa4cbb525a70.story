As someone who's famous for her role as an indestructible cheerleader on TV sci-fi show Heroes, Hayden Panettiere may seem an odd choice to become a pro-democracy campaigner in a former Soviet state.

But yesterday she addressed protestors in Kiev's Independence Square with her fiance, Ukrainian boxing champion Vladimir Klitschko.

The 24-year-old American, also famous for her role as an upstart country music singer on Nashville, encouraged Ukrainian protesters to 'keep fighting'.

Save the cheerleader, save the world: U.S. actress Hayden Panettiere, pictured with fiance Vladimir Klitschko, spoke to supporters of Ukrainian EU integration during a rally in Kiev

A Reuters reporter at the scene saw the protesters breaking up the statue with hammers after toppling it with the help of metal bars and rope.

Pro-Europe demonstrators took to the streets of Kiev after President Viktor Yanukovich's November 21 decision to abandon a trade and integration deal with the EU and pursue closer economic ties with Moscow.

Protesters have since blockaded the main government headquarters and occupied Kiev's city hall.

Addressing protesters from a stage, 
set up in the middle of the square, Panettiere told Ukrainians to 'keep 
fighting', adding that the country had 'a right to a democracy'.

'The
 beauty of this country is breathtaking: the landscape, your beautiful 
churches. But nothing compares to the undeniably deep souls of the 
Ukrainian people,' she said.

'There's
 a movement happening here, and you have a chance to make things right, 
to make things just. You have a right to a democracy,' she added, as 
Vladimir Klitschko translated her speech into Russian.

'And
 as an American I want you to know that I stand by you, I support your 
fight, and I will support it until the country of Ukraine in its 
entirety reflects the beauty, the true beauty of Ukrainian people. Keep 
fighting. I love you all,' Panettiere said.

Younger brother of Ukrainian 
opposition leader Vitaly Klitschko, Vladimir, and Panettiere walked 
among protesters at the square, which has turned into a protest camp.

And today the protesters toppled a statue of Soviet state founder Vladimir Lenin in Kiev.

The
 statue has symbolic importance as it underlines Ukraine's shared 
history with Russia, which is now trying to persuade Kiev to join a new 
Moscow-led customs union.

Klitschko, who won an Olympic gold medal 
in 1996, and Panettiere began their relationship in 2009 before breaking
 it off in 2011 and rekindling it again.

His
 brother Vitali Klitschko, the reigning world heavyweight boxing 
champion, has emerged as Ukraine's most popular opposition figure and 
has ambitions to become its next president.

Thanks
 to his sports-hero status and reputation as a pro-Western politician 
untainted by Ukraine's frequent corruption scandals, the 6-foot 7-inch 
Klitschko has surpassed jailed former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko in
 opinion polls.

As massive anti-government protests continue to grip Ukraine, the 42-year-old boxer-turned-politician is urging his countrymen to continue their fight to turn this ex-Soviet republic into a genuine Western democracy.

'This is not a revolution. It is a peaceful protest that demands justice,' Klitschko told The Associated Press in an interview Wednesday. 'The people are not defending political interests. They are defending the idea of living in a civilized country.'

Dubbed Dr Ironfist for his prowess in the boxing ring, Klitschko has scored 45 victories in 47 fights, 41 of them with knockouts. He has successfully defended his title 11 times, most recently in September 2012, and plans to have one more bout before he retires. He still spends several hours a day training.

Now Klitschko must prove that he has as much stamina in the political arena.
