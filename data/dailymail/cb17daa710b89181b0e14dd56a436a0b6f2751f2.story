Alice Rambridge suffers from a rare condition which means she has never felt pain or cried

For most children, a grazed knee - and the tears that follow - are a normal part of childhood.

But Alice Rambridge has never had such an experience - because she is unable to feel pain.

The nine-year-old  suffers from a rare condition which means the two sides of her brain are not connected as they should be.

Called agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC), the disorder means even 
when Alice touches a hot stove that burns her, she will not react . 

The schoolgirl’s condition - which has given her an extremely high pain 
threshold - is so rare only around 50 cases have been recorded 
worldwide.

It also means she is unable to describe pain - and has never cried - despite battling  bugs, colds, chicken pox, tonsillitis.

Her mother Lindsay, 37, said: 'Like all children do, Alice will fall down and graze herself - but she doesn’t react to it.

'She has never once cried - and I began to wonder if she had any tear ducts.

'When she gets ill and is admitted to hospital, I can see she is confused because she can’t feel anything is wrong.'

'She once put her finger on the hot stove - but carried on  playing as 
though nothing had happened, while I rushed around trying to get water for the burn.

'Another time her forehead was  green with bruises - but she wasn’t phased at all.

Alice was diagnosed with ACC when she was 19 months old.

The condition is defined as complete or partial absence of the corpus callosum - the structure that connects the two hemispheres of the brain.

Even after cutting her knee during a PE lesson, Alice felt no pain - and when admitted to hospital to treat her various other ailments, she struggles to understand why she is there

The 
condition occurs when the nerve fibres that make up the corpus callosum do not form - meaning signals cannot be 
passed back and forth between the hemispheres of the brain.

The rare 
genetic chromosome disorder also causes underdevelopment in parts of the
 brain, so Alice struggles to understand social cues.

Ms Rambridge, from Preston, Lancashire, added: 'I always have to make sure Alice is in a safe space so she can’t hurt herself - and don’t take her too situations which may trigger any confusion for her.

Symptoms
 include vision impairment, low perception of pain, delayed toilet 
training,  feeding/chewing and swallowing difficulties and seizures.

'In the last two years I have started worrying more because she is getting older now and I don’t know what the future holds.

'But it is hard to be upset when Alice is always smiling back at me.'

Alice also suffers from epilepsy, global development delay, problems swallowing, sensory difficulties, eczema, low muscle tone and poor immune system - which causes her to often fall ill.

Ms Rambridge is now fundraising in order to buy a specialist bed for 
Alice which costs £7,000 - and cannot be funded by social services. 

Writing on her fundraising page, she said: 'It has been a hard nine years, she has gone through so much but she still manages to smile lots.

'She [Alice] is an amazing, loving, inspirational, courageous and encouraging little girl. She never ever gives in and can put a smile on the most miserable persons face. She is my sunshine and little star.

'I just want to make everything as easy and as comfortable as possible for her.'
