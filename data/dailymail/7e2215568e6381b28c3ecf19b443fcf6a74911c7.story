The eight-year-old boy who wrote a heartfelt letter to Santa Claus asking for help to stop his sister being bullied at school got one of his Christmas wishes early.

Ryan Suffern's letter made news around the world after his mother Karen posted it on her Facebook page over the weekend, touched that he wanted to forgo his presents to help his twin sister Amber - but also heartbroken her daughter was suffering.

He also asked that her favorite band Big Time Rush come to Amber's birthday party as it would 'make her so happy'.

After seeing the letter, Good Morning America brought the family to New York today and while Amber was being interviewed about being bullied, the band appeared from behind a curtain to surprise her.

Selfless: Twin brother Ryan wrote a letter to Santa asking for help to stop his sister's bullying instead of getting a remote control car and a helicopter

She was visibly shell-shocked as the band members held her hand and serenaded her as an early birthday present for her, as Ryan had asked in his letter to Santa.

But more importantly, the letter allowed Karen Suffern to discuss the bullying issue with Rocky Mount Preparatory in North Carolina so they could work to make school better for her daughter.

The eight-year-old revealed to GMA 
that other students called her 'fat', 'ugly', 'stupid' and 'hideous', 
and said she did not know why they picked on her.

Protective brother Ryan said he wished they would pick on him instead of his sister.

Mom: Karen Suffern cried as she recalled a conversation she had with her daughter when the eight-year-old told her, 'sometimes I just feel like I wanna die so they'll leave me alone

Real love: Amber Suffern hugs her twin brother Ryan who was sad after seeing his sister picked on because of her weight

At 140 pounds, Amber is almost twice 
the size of Ryan. Karen says she has attention-deficit 
disorder and other mental and mood disorders - and is an
emotional eater as a result.

Ryan's letter to Santa started off normally: 'Dear Santa… I wanted a (remote control) car and helicopter, but I don’t want that anymore. 

'Kid
at school are still picking on Amber and its (sic) not fair,’ he wrote.
‘I prayed that they will stop but god is bisy (sic) and needs your 
help.

'Is it against the rules to give up gifts early? Can you ask Big Time Rush to come to Amber’s birthday party? It will make her so happy.

'If you do not get them to come that is fine, just get her everything she asked for.'

Mom Karen Suffern said she wept openly when she read the letter her son Ryan had written in which he told Santa he was willing to forgo any Christmas presents this year if the bullies at school would leave his sister Amber alone

Ryan wrote the touching letter after single mom Suffern had asked her kids to write to Santa so she could get an idea of what presents they wanted for Christmas

Dear Santa,

My mom said to send you a Christmas list. I wanted a remote control car and helicopter but I do not want that anymore.

Kids at school are still picking on Amber and it is not fair because she does not do anything to them and it makes me mad.

I prayed they would stop, but God is busy and I need your help.

Is it against the rules to give up gifts early?

Can you ask Big Time Rush to come to Amber’s birthday party? It will make her so happy.

If you do not get them to come that is fine, just get her everything she asked for.

Thanks Santa,

Love Ryan

PS- My mom throws the best birthday parties. You can come if you want.

Ryan wrote the 
touching letter after Karen, a single mom who struggles to pay the bills, asked her kids to write to 
Santa early so she could get an idea of what presents they wanted for 
Christmas.

She said she had a vague idea her 
daughter was being teased, but reading Ryan’s letter opened her 
eyes to what she had to endure on a daily basis.

Speaking to GMA, Karen recalled a 
conversation she had with her daughter after she read Ryan's letter when
the eight-year-old told her, 'sometimes I just feel like I wanna die so
they’ll leave me alone'.

'As soon as those words came out of 
her mouth, I literally felt my heart stop,' Karen said.

'I told her I 
would do everything I could to protect her.

'The school has been in touch and 
they’re making sure my daughter feels comfortable and safe.

'They moved 
her on the bus because about 98 per cent of the bullying takes place on 
the bus. 

'She’s now sitting with her cousin 
who’s much older than Amber is. Today and yesterday she didn’t wake up 
begging me to let her stay home, so I guess that’s a good sign,' she 
said.

'I try to build up my daughter's self-esteem and tell her she is beautiful, but people say hurtful things to me, because I also have a weight problem, and that hurts me. 

'I can't imagine what she goes through.’

The family will also be VIP guests at Big Time Rush's concert this weekend.
