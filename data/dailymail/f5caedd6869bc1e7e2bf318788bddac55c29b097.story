After smashing through a fence and thundering down a steep grassy bank, the car was heading straight for the 50ft cliffs and the rocks below.

But miraculously, the driver of the silver BMW escaped with her life after the vehicle came to rest just inches from the edge of the precipice.

However the drama didn’t end there. With the car’s front wheels hanging over the top of the cliff, emergency services had to make sure the ground didn’t give way beneath them before they could reach the casualty.

Having stabilised the car, the 32-year-old woman was put on a spinal board and airlifted to hospital with suspected back, hip, pelvis and leg injuries.

Members of the coastguard, fire brigade, police, ambulance and RAF search and rescue all attended the scene near Flamborough, East Yorkshire.

Residents said they were amazed the car hadn’t gone over the edge of the cliff because the  ground there is extremely unstable.

David Clark, 59, said: ‘The cliff at that spot has been eroding quite rapidly and mounds of earth quite regularly fall on  to the beach. I’m staggered a car of that weight hasn’t caused the ground to fall beneath it. All the emergency services should be applauded because it is so precarious there at the moment.’

Michael Garry, 29, added: ‘The casualty has been unbelievably lucky, another few inches and she would have plunged on to the rocks. I’m amazed the ground there hasn’t given way.’

Peter Baron, of Humberside Fire and Rescue Service, said: ‘We were informed the car was hanging over the cliff edge in quite a precarious position with someone still inside. The car had to be stabilised to ensure the safety of the lady stuck in the vehicle and of the crews.’

The car left the road close to the scene of a similar rescue mission last year. In July, a 35-year-old woman was airlifted to hospital from Thornwick Bay after her Fiat Punto stopped just feet away from a 40ft cliff.
