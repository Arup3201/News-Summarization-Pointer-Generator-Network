President Obama has returned to his favored campaigning style as he gave a speech about the need for immigration reform to a group of advocates at the White House today.

The President spoke about the need for Washington to move past the unpopular shutdown infighting and called upon politicians to unite behind substantive immigration reform.

‘Rather than create problems, let’s prove to the American people that Washington can actually solve some problems,’ he said during the speech in the East Room.

Moving on: President Obama gave a speech in the White House on Thursday pushing for a united vote following the shutdown over the budget battle

‘Let’s see if we can get this done and let’s see if we can get it done this year. We’ve got the time to do it. Republicans in the house including the Speaker have said we should act so let’s not wait. It doesn’t get easier to delay.’

The Senate already passed their version of a bill in June- which the President conceded was not perfect in anyone’s view- and now it is up to the House of Representatives to set a date for a vote.

Speaker John Boehner, whose approval ratings dropped dramatically during the shutdown that was viewed by the public as largely being caused by the Republicans, said that there would be enough support in the House to pass a bipartisan immigration bill but likely not the one that President Obama supports.

That came as little surprise to the President, as he even said that there is a sentiment for some people in Washington that their policy decisions are seen in a binary way: ‘Well, if Obama's for it, then I'm against it,’ he joked.

Faces of immigration: The President stuck to the talking points but had a hand-picked crowd of immigrants and issue advocates standing behind him and Vice President Joe Biden

Eyes on the prize: Immigration reform was a major campaign promise of President Obamas and a number of his supporters have been critical of the fact that it has taken him a year into his second term to address the issue

Boehner's spokesman put out a statement 
immediately following the speech saying that the Speaker does want to 
approve a 'common sense, step-by-step approach' but is vehemently 
opposed to 'massive' legislation.

If passed, the proposed law would allow certain immigrants six years to apply for a work or family visa to gain legal status in the country within.

That is just the beginning of a 13-year path that is proposed by the bill.

In order to be given legal approval, they will have to prove that they are not a burden to the American economy, or else they will be deported to their home countries.

It will also add billions of dollars to increase border control as part of a way to appeal to hard line conservatives.

President Obama focused on the talking points of the Senate bill- touting the fact that independent economists have said that the measure would help grow the economy and shrink the deficit by nearly a trillion dollars.

He used a crowd of unnamed immigration activists standing on risers behind him to put the personal face on the issue.

'It doesn't make sense to have 11 million people who are in this country illegally without any incentive or any way for them to come out of the shadows, get right with the law, meet their responsibilities and permit their families then to move ahead,' he said.

'It's not smart; it's not fair; it doesn't make sense. We have kicked this particular can down the road for too long.

The question of training highly-trained workers at American universities but then forcing them to leave the country and use their skills elsewhere because of visa concerns is an issue that has been brought up by many business leaders, including Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and outgoing New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.

‘It's not smart to invite some of the
brightest minds from around the world to study here and then not let 
them start businesses here. We've sent them back to their home countries
to start businesses and create jobs and invent new products someplace 
else,' the President said in his Thursday speech.

Reaching out: The President shook hands with hand-picked supporters after the brief remarks, though their names were never revealed, nor were any reasons why they were chosen

Facing the issue: The President is pushing for the bill to be passed in the House this year

‘It
would make sure that everybody plays by the same rules by providing a 
pathway to earned citizenship for those who are here illegally, one that
includes passing a background check, learning English, paying taxes, 
paying a penalty, getting in line behind everyone who is trying to come 
here the right way.

‘Obviously just because something is smart and fair and good for the economy and fiscally responsible and supported by business and labor, the evangelical community and many Democrats and many Republicans, that does not mean that it will actually get done. This is Washington, after all.’

Try as he may, the President was playing a bit of politics himself as he had Vice President Joe Biden at his side throughout the event.

Biden is in a tight private competition with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to take the party's reins when the President's second term comes to a close in 2016.

Clinton is widely seen as the one to beat, but Biden has been making his intentions known with trips to pivotal primary battleground states like Iowa in recent weeks.
