The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were branded ‘irresponsible’ last night over a £260 child car seat fitted in Prince George’s official car just hours before his hugely anticipated first royal tour was due to begin.

The Maxi-Cosi Tobi safety seat was installed in the ‘royal limo’ for the future king by Plunket, a national charity which provides services and support to parents and young children.

At Kate and William’s specific request, a technician from the society installed the seat facing outwards.

Controversy: Prince George, pictured a day old, will face forwards in the royal limo on the tour Down Under

In the UK that would be perfectly acceptable as government guidelines state that babies and infants only need to be carried in rear-facing seats until they can sit up unaided - something eight-month-old George is now able to do - and have exceeded the maximum weight for the seat.

But Plunket, which is a hugely influential group locally, is very vocal about its own guidelines which recommend children remain in rear-facing car seats until the age of two.

Rear facing seats, it says, significantly reduce the risk of death or injury, protecting the baby’s head, neck and spine even as a toddler.

Despite its public stance it proudly issued photographs of its car seat services technician Aethalia O’Connor fitting George’s offending restrainer and saying: ‘If it can’t be installed correctly we need to work out a way we can make it correct. We need to make sure the baby is safe.’

Response to the photograph was immediate with hundreds of parents going online to complain about double standards.

Helen Lawrence said on the Plunket Facebook page: ‘They [William and Kate] have made an irresponsible decision about facing their baby forwards in the car.‘

Michelle Green added: ‘You went against everything you recommended, undoing all your hard work regarding rear facing until two.’ Last night, however, the society was unapologetic.

Chief executive Jenny Prince said Plunket’s role was ‘to provide advice and work in partnership with parents’ to make informed decisions that worked best for them.'

Although the young royal, pictured a day old, is legally old enough to face forwards in the UK, the firm's guidelines state a child must be two years old before graduating from rear-facing safety chairs

Until now, the eight-month-old royal has faced backwards on car journeys, and is now old enough to face ahead

He added: ‘’Plunket’s priority is to ensure car seats are installed by qualified car seat technicians to ensure they perform correctly. While Plunket recommend that children stay in rear-facing seats until age two, it is not a legal requirement.’

Plunket spokesman Zac Prendergast said he had spoken to Miss O’Connor, and stressed that the seat was installed ‘in line with the parents’ preferences’.

The row is particularly embarrassing as the organisation has organised a meet and greet with other babies of a similar age for Prince George, who will be accompanied by his parents, at Government House in Wellington on Wednesday.

In another potentially awkward moment, a leading New Zealand politician also warned yesterday it was ‘inevitable’ the country would become a republic.

Former deputy prime minister Sir Don McKinnon, who was also secretary general of the Commonwealth for eight years, said the country had been moving to renounce the Royal Family ‘for a long time’.

‘There are 54 countries in the Commonwealth, only 16 are realms [where the Queen is head of state], and I can tell you now that one Caribbean publicly, and three Caribbean privately, are probably going to give up the relationship with the monarchy when the Queen dies. So it is a diminishing group of countries and the important thing is for us to openly and candidly debate the issue,’ he said.

Asked when New Zealand might go down the same road, Sir Don added: ‘I don’t know when....[but] I think it is inevitable.

The family have come under fire for overriding the charity's minimum age limit of two years for outward-facing safety seats just hours ahead of touching down in Sydney for their tour of Australia or New Zealand

The couple's private secretary said the tour has been designed with Prince George's comfort in mind

‘I’m quite certain the royal family understands that completely.’ William, Kate and their son, Prince George, were last night on a flight heading Down Under to begin a landmark three week tour of both New Zealand and Australia, another country where the republican cause is strong.

The Mail understands that they were travelling First Class, along with George’s new Spanish nanny, Maria Theresa Turrion Burallo, 43, and a fulsome security detail, on a Quantas flight via Dubai. Tickets cost around £6,300 return.

The plane is due to land in Sydney early on Monday morning, allowing the royal party to transfer to a New Zealand Royal Air Force jet which will transport them for the first leg of their tour. The bill for all flights associated with the tour is being met by local taxayers.

Although the three week trip, undertaken on behalf of the Queen, has been more than a year in the planning, it has very much been designed with baby George in mind, according to aides.

And instead of hawking themselves from city to city, as is customary on overseas royal visits, William and Kate will base their young son in three different ‘hubs’: Wellington, Sydney and Canberra.

The arrangement means his doting parents will be able to travel back to see George almost every night - bar a stop-over in Queenstown, New Zealand, and another at Ayers Rock in Australia.

‘It’s a long way to go and [would mean] a long time away from their son,’ the couple’s private secretary, Miguel Head, said earlier this month.

‘The tour has been designed with Prince George’s consideration and comfort in mind.

‘Taking a nine month old on a Royal tour is not a first, but it has not happened in this Royal Family’s context for many, many years so there has been much to think about - as any new parent travelling long distance will recognise.’

Royal aides have warned that George’s scheduled public appearances are open to change given his young age and the fact that no-one knows how he will cope with the long journey and 11-hour time difference.

Sources have told the Mail that the little prince is also teething - as well as starting to crawl - which will only add to the unpredictability.

But he is, generally, a happy little boy say friends of the couple, who is adept to taking everything in his stride - including, hopefully, the large crowds waiting for their first glimpse of the future king.
