V presenter Stephen Fry is among the first to make the shift

Britain is getting a new national web address of ‘.uk’ from today in what is being described as the biggest shake-up in the internet for 30 years.

The change means businesses and individuals can choose to drop the familiar ‘.co.uk’ and ‘.com’ suffixes from their web addresses in favour of the short and simple ‘.uk’.

Just as Germany has a ‘.de’ domain name and France has its own ‘.fr’, so the British will be able to demonstrate their national affiliation with ‘.uk’.

TV presenter Stephen Fry is among the first to make the shift, while both small start-up companies and major household names are set to follow suit.

Among the other first adopters are the tech start-up Lowdownapp, which is switching from ‘.co.uk’, and the independent craft lager company Saint Lager, which is changing from a ‘.com’ to ‘enjoysaint.uk’.

The change is being overseen by Nominet, which is a private, not-for-profit business that is responsible for the smooth and secure running of the .uk internet infrastructure.

The introduction of ‘.uk’ is one of a number of new domain name options that have become available with a major shake-up in the web address system, which include ‘.london’, ‘.bbc’, ‘.cymru’ and ‘.company’. 

Nominet is rolling out the world’s largest welcome sign – reading ‘welcometothe.uk’ – at Heathrow airport to mark what it claims is the biggest change to the UK internet infrastructure since it began.

Visible from as high as 35,000 feet, and measuring nearly 10,000 square feet, the welcome sign is positioned on the approach to the main runway at London Heathrow airport, to greet those arriving.

Some 40 per cent larger than the ‘Hollywood’ letters, and hundreds of times the size of the traditional British welcome signs that frequent motorways up and down the country, the welcometothe.uk sign took ten men over eight hours to put in place.

Research by Nominet found three quarters of British internet users prefer sites ending in ‘.uk’ when searching or buying online. Some 93 per cent preferred the short and simple ‘.uk’ to other options.

Nominet’s chief operating officer, Eleanor Bradley, said: ‘The new ‘.uk’ is for people who want a short, memorable domain with a popular and trusted ending. We know this combination appeals to our tech-savvy, digitally-engaged population. 

Will amazon be among the major companies that changes its domain name from amazon,co.uk to amazon.uk?

‘When asked if they wanted ‘.uk’ to be an option alongside. co.uk, 72 per cent of businesses questioned said yes.

‘We’re delighted that Stephen Fry has chosen .uk, given that he’s known for being an early digital adopter’ 

More than ten million existing UK domain holders will be offered first choice on the shorter equivalent of their current address, with five years to decide whether they want to use it in addition to, or instead of, the domain they already have. 

People can sign up for the new ‘.uk’ domains through one of a number of domain name registrars, alongside existing domains such as .co.uk or .org.uk. The wholesale price is the same as for a ‘.co.uk’ at £5 for two years. Domain names are sold through domain registrars, who set a higher retail price to individuals and businesses.
