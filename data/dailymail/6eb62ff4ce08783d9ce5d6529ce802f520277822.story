A 'heartbroken and humiliated' New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie apologized Thursday for his staff's 'callous' conduct leading to the 'Bridgegate' controversy that will either dampen his hopes at a run for the White House or strengthen his image as a no-nonsense executive who places a premium on accountability.

Christie revealed at a two-hour press conference that he has fired Bridget Kelly, the deputy chief of staff who conspired to block vehicle lanes to the George Washington Bridge, snarling traffic and delivering a political blow to a New Jersey mayor who refused to back the governor's re-election bid.

'I terminated her employment because she lied to me,' he said. 'I am embarrassed and humiliated by the conduct of some of the people on my team.'

Garden State circus: Chris Christie fended off questions about his management on Thursday, taking responsibility for the bridgegate episode but blaming specific staffers who have now been fired

Christie also dismissed Bill Stepien,
 his former campaign manager who just days ago seemed destined lead the 
state's Republican Party, saying that exercising leadership sometimes 
requires politicians to fire their friends. Stepien has also lost a 
lucrative consulting deal with the Republican Governors Association, 
which Christie leads.

Christie,
 who appeared confident and traded barbs with reporters, could see his presidential hopes disappear if it is proved he knew 
about the affair. He insisted that he first learned Wednesday about a raft 
of emails that exposed his staff's conspiracy. 'I was blindsided,' Christie said.

He also said that
 he never considered resigning over the issue. 'Oh my god. I didn't do 
anything wrong. That's a crazy question,' a bullish – but not bullying – Christie told reporters.

Just
 as Christie finished his lengthy performance, an official implicated in
 the scandal asserted his Fifth Amendment rights and refused to answer 
questions during a state assembly committee – as a prosecutor mulled 
criminal charges over the affair.

The
 assembly's transportation committee then voted to hold him in contempt,
 over objections from his lawyer, since the witness defied their 
subpoena for his testimony.

Christie explained on Thursday that he 'was done with my workout yesterday morning at 8.45 a.m. and got a call from my 
communications director ... informing me of this story that had just 
broken. That was the first time I knew 
about this, the first time I had seen any of the documents that were 
revealed yesterday.'

'I had no knowledge or involvement in this issue, in its planning or its execution,' he said later, 'and I am stunned by the abject stupidity that was shown here, regardless of what the facts ultimately uncover.'

Christie
 said that an hour before he publicly denied any involvement in statements to the press 
in December, he gave his inner circle an opportunity to come clean.

'They all reported that there was no information other than what we already knew,' he said.

Kelly's
 failure to own up to her involvement, he said Thursday, 'shows a lack 
of respect for the appropriate role of government.' Christie said he felt 'betrayed' by her.

He said he was 'heartbroken,' 'blindsided,' and 'embarrassed and humiliated' as the story broke on Wednesday.

He
 added that he was 'ultimately responsible' for what had happened, but 
said the true measure of leadership is fixing something when it has gone
 wrong and that is what he intended to do.

'Sad': Christie said he was disappointed in his staff's actions, but claimed it was a measure of leadership to act ruthlessly when you discover something had gone wrong

GOP leaders at the national level 
watched the drama unfold with an eye toward the 2016 race, with the 
governor's supporters keenly aware that his performance throughout the scandal will determine whether he is considered presidential material.

New
 Jersey lawmakers believe Christie's political appointees may face 
criminal charges in connection with a political revenge stunt that 
snarled traffic on one of the nation's busiest bridges in September.

And Fort Lee, N.J. Mayor Mark Sokolich, whose municipality was targeted after he refused to endorse Christie's re-election effort, slammed Wildstein, directly for joking about his Croatian ethnicity in instant messages while he helped plot the traffic mess with Kelly.

'David Wildstein deserves an ass-kicking,' he said on MSNBC. 'Sorry, there, I said it.'

On CNN, he called the actions of Christie's team a 'venomous form of political retaliation.'

The comments came as State Senator Ray Lesniak told the Newark Star-Ledger that 'there’s gotta be dozens of state and federal criminal law violations' connected with the scandal.

Lesniak has called on U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman to convene a federal grand jury.

'This is the use of governmental authority for political retribution in a manner that jeopardized lives,' the Democratic lawmaker said.

The New York Times reported Thursday that Fishman had opened an 'inquiry.'

Fort Lee, New Jersey, Mayor Mark Sokolich said former Christie aide David Wildstein 'needs and ass-kicking'

The SEC's inquiry follows several other probes launched after the so-called Bridgegate scandal, in which operatives loyal to Christie's administration are accused of causing traffic jams on the George Washington Bridge in September in retribution for a New Jersey mayor not endorsing Christie's re-election

The liberal blog Talking Points Memo asked New Jersey State Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg if she thought criminal charges were possible. She replied, 'Yes.'

'I am not a lawyer,' she said. 'I am not a prosecutor, but from where I come from, you can't use public facilities to politically punish people.'

In the face of a possible criminal probe, Wildstein refused to answer questions during
 a state assembly committee.

'On the advice of counsel, I 
respectfully assert my right to remain silent under the United States 
and New Jersey constitutions,' said David Wildstein as cameras flashed 
and nearly two dozen TV cameras jockeyed for position.

The committee later voted to hold him in contempt.

On Wednesday a New Jersey Assembly committee released 22 pages of an estimated 3,000 it has received in connection with subpoenas related to the growing scandal.

Emails and instant messages in those pages depict Christie staffers giddy at their cleverness in punishing Sokolich.

Traffic lanes in Fort Lee feed into the bridge; several were blocked in September, delaying school buses on the first day of school and stranding commuters for hours.

'We had families looking for emergency services, to respond to 911 calls,' Sokolich told MSNBC on Wednesday.

'Calls that take 3 minutes were taking 11 and 12 minutes ... and on top of that we had thousands of kids late for the first day of school.'

Worse yet, a 91-year-old Fort Lee woman died as the lane closures delayed emergency medical help.

Bridget Kelly kicked off the traffic shenanigans with a gleeful email to Port Authority official David Wildstein on August 13, subpoenaed documents show

Wildstein, the former Port Authority aide who is directly implicated in the fast-developing scandal, is scheduled to testify in a noon hearing before the state assembly's transportation committee.

His lawyers argued Thursday morning that he should not have to appear, claiming that a subpoena demanding his testimony wasn't properly signed.

In the emails and instant messages, Wildstein, Christie deputy chief of staff Bridget Anne Kelly and another Port Authority appointee reveled in the calculated effort to retaliate against 
Sokolich

'Time
 for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,' Kelly wrote weeks before the 
event, suggesting the development of a long-term plan for vindictive 
political payback.

'Got 
it,' responded Wildstein, who later resigned.

Wildstein also responded 'Is it wrong that I am smiling', when he saw a message that read: 'I feel sorry for the kids'.

The Christie 
administration would later claim that forcing three lanes of the bridge 
into a single toll booth was the result of a mismanaged traffic study 
supervised by Wildstein. 

Christie is set to be inaugurated for a second term as governor on January 21.
