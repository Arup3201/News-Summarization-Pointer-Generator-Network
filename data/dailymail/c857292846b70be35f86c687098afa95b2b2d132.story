Their sober attire and middle-aged respectability offered the perfect cover.

No one suspected a thing as this couple browsed the spectacle racks in a Boots optician’s.

It was only later that staff discovered that 59 pairs of expensive frames worth £12,361 had gone missing.

Suspects: After the middle-aged duo browsed the designer frames at the Essex opticians, staff discovered 59 pairs had gone missing

The culprits, believed to be in their 
late fifties or early sixties, were caught on CCTV as they stole glasses
with frames by designers such as Givenchy, Ray Ban, DKNY, Calvin Klein 
and Versace from the Boots branch in Southend, Essex.

Acting Inspector Ian Hughes, from Essex Police, said the footage appeared to show the suspects hiding the expensive glasses in a large bag.

'This is an unusual theft of high-value glasses,' he added. 'The couple appeared to be innocently browsing the shelves before concealing the frames in a bag and leaving the store.

'This is a brazen theft which has 
left the shop thousands of pounds out of pocket. We are keen to speak to
anyone who has information about these two suspects,' he said.

'We would urge
people to be vigilant and if anyone is offered designer glasses in 
suspicious circumstances they should make police aware.'

The frames, which were stolen on Wednesday morning, were worth a total of £12,361.

Anyone with information about this theft, believed to have occurred at 11.10am on Wednesday, should contact PC Darren Wooderson at Essex Police.
