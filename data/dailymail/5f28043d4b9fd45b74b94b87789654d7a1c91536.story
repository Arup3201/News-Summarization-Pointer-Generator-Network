Real Madrid youngster Fran Perez may soon be dubbed the new David Beckham after the midfielder scored a sensational goal from inside his own half.

Perez picked up the ball more than 50 yards out before turning and lofting the ball over the Atletico Madrid Under 19s goalkeeper in the mini-derby.

His goal held a striking resemblance to Beckham’s effort for Manchester United against Wimbledon in 1996.

Beckham too picked up the ball miles from goal before lofting the ball over an embarrassed Neill Sullivan as the number 10 helped Manchester United to a 2-0 victory.

Perez may argue that his effort was actually slightly further out than Beckham’s, but there was certainly no argument that it was the standout moment of the match.

And it may not be too long before we see Perez gracing the same pitch as Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale at the club.
