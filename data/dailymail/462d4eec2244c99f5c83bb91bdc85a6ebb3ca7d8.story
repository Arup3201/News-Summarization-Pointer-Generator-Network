Body Mass Index (BMI) has been used for years to measure whether we need to watch what we're eating.

But numerous professionals have come forward saying that unless you are severely overweight tracking your health and fitness through BMI may be redundant.

As a result, sales of speciality scales - which measure your body composition including levels of muscle, fat and water - are soaring. 

Some of these use Bio-electrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) technology to safely pass a signal through the body to tell you if you're carrying too much fat, and where it's being stored.

A slim person with little muscle mass and a stomach paunch could be classed as healthy, despite visceral fat

BMI involves dividing your weight in kgs by your height in metres squared to monitor weight and health.

But it fails to accurately assess your body fat as a muscly athlete might be classed as obese, despite carrying little or no body fat, simply because muscle is more dense - i.e. heavier - than fat.

At the other end of the scale, a slim person with little muscle mass and a stomach paunch could be classed as healthy, despite the fact that they may be carrying excessive fat around the waistline.

This is important because visceral fat, which lies in and around the abdomen, is thought to be a key risk factor in the development of type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Visceral fat secretes molecules that, among other things, lead to damaging inflammation in blood vessels.

This flaw in BMI is why even super-fit people can be told to go on extreme diets because they register as overweight or obese on the chart.

Personal trainers like to track your circumferential measurements (girth measurements - waist, hips etc)

Dr David Ashton, an obesity expert and medical director at Healthier Weight, said: 'The greatest concern is that BMI doesn't address the critical issue of how much fat a person has in their body and where it is distributed.' 

New products and guides are fast coming out in the hope of giving more accurate and helpful measures of health based on what your weight is made up of - rather than what it totals. 

Tanita body composition monitors, for example, can help you track your fitness, measure body composition and lose excess fat using BIA.

Instead of simply reading your overall body mass and calculating your weight, they measure statistics such as weight, body fat percentage, muscle mass, body water, basal metabolic rate and visceral fat. 

They've just brought out the Tanita BC-730, one of the first speciality BIA scales created for the home rather than the gym, for £45. 

A spokesperson for Tanita says: 'It's incredibly important to monitor your body composition when losing weight. 

When you exercise more or start dieting, your body composition will change, even if your weight stays the same.'

Low-calorie crash diets may produce speedy results, but the weight loss will most likely be from water and even healthy, lean muscle tissue. They can force your body into starvation mode, storing body fat rather than burning it - so even if you lose weight your body fat could increase.

Personal trainer Jack Braniff of Urban Energie Fitness has his own ways of making sure a client is making progress.

He says: 'Weighing yourself does have its place, but can't be seen as the only measurement to look out for. 

'It doesn't provide us with the whole story, not taking into account hydration levels, lean body mass, how healthy you are, and even though they weigh the same, muscle looks far better than fat!

'Likewise, bio-electrical impedance analysis still isn't a great tool in terms of accuracy. 

'As a current is used to determine your fat percentage it will look for the easiest way out of your body, so a lot of these machines where you only stand on, or hold, miss whole sections!

'One day they could give a good reading, and on another you could get a bad reading. Hydration levels will also reduce accuracy of results.

'I like to use a number of different metrics when testing how well someone is doing.

'They include body fat, circumferential measurements - girth measurements - waist, hips - skin folds, how your clothes fit and your weight. 

'But the easiest and most noticeable metric will be before and after photographs - and for most of you, how you look is probably the reason why you're doing this!

'Bod Pods are your best bet but are expensive, a few places in London do them. For a bit cheaper, a good PT should be able to take skin fold measurements which are great, unless you're obese (then weight is the best tool!).'

Bod Pods look like a giant white plastic egg that you can sit in. They use air displacement to work out your mass (weight) using very accurate electronic scales, and volume. From these calculations, body density and fat levels can be worked out.

Behind the seat is a moving 'diaphragm' which varies the volume inside the front chamber. This is measured before and after you get in, with your body volume therefore worked out by subtraction.

For example, if the interior air volume of the empty chamber is 400 litres, and the volume of the chamber is reduced to 350 litres with the subject inside, the body volume of the subject would be 50 litres.

Bod Pods readings are available in hospitals such as University Hospital in Coventry and are able to work out your detailed body mass, fat mass and body volume - as well as an estimate on your own personal metabolic rate.
