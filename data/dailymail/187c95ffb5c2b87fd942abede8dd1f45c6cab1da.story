A 22-year-old man studying at University of Canberra has been accused of raping a man after luring the teenager for sex with a fake woman’s Facebook profile.

Billy Barthomeuz Tamawiyi, a devout Christian studying in Australia on an Indonesian government scholarship, has been refused bail in the ACT Magistrates Court after allegedly raping his 18-year-old victim in late August.

It is claimed Tamawiyi created a Facebook page with the pseudonym ‘Taylor Edwards’ and targeting his victim.

When Tamawiyi met with the 18-year-old, it’s alleged he raped the man and threatened him over the phone.

The 22-year-old man has been charged with two counts of sexual intercourse without consent; and one charge of blackmail, using a carriage service for child pornography material and using a carriage service to menace, harass or offend.

‘The alleged offender used a fictitious Facebook profile to communicate with the 18-year-old victim over a period of time,’ ACT Police Media confirm.

‘As a part of this communication, the man sent the victim photographs and a series of demands while pretending to be the young woman.’

The politics and international relations student has been refused bail, as Magistrate Bernadette Boss believes Tamawiyi is a flight risk, will offend again or will be a threat to the victim.

Detective Superintendent Paul Shakeshaft of Criminal Investigations warns the public of the various risks they are susceptible to through social media use.

‘Fictitious profiles are becoming more prevalent and are used to deceive people in a number of different ways. This deception may lead to fraud and identity theft,’ Superintendent Shakeshaft said.
