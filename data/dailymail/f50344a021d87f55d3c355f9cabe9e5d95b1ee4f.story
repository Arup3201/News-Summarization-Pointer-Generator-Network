His manifesto featured him wearing Union Jack boxer shorts and promised a monorail.

But that was not going to stand in the way of a 'joke' student union candidate who has won a landslide victory at one of the world's oldest universities.

Louis Trup, a geography student at Oxford University, won despite his pledges including 'double beds for all' and world peace.

Joke: Louis Trup's crayon-scrawled manifesto, which promised a monorail and said he was one of Oxford's 'best clubbers'. He won 1,685 votes - 710 more than his nearest rival, who was from the Labour club

Politics: Louis Trup, pictured DJing in tie-dye and Union Jack boxer shorts. He used the photo on his manifesto

Styling himself DJ LJ Trup, the third-year student said it would be 'funny' and claimed he was an alternative to 'un-fun 
student politicians working towards a cosy Labour seat in 20 years'.

The Brasenose College student listed the reasons to vote for him as 'I do Geography', 'I often wear flip flops' and being named one of Oxford's 'top clubbers'.

He beat his rivals at an official hustings by performing a spoof Country-and-Western song instead of speaking about his policies.

At one point he is thought to have emulated the 1995 film Braveheart by giving a rabble-rousing speech backed by a kilt-wearing bagpipe player.

Instead of writing a manifesto, he wrote a 'personifesto' in an apparent attempt to combat sexism.

He also swore he would abolish Fifth Week, the middle of an Oxford term, to eliminate 'Fifth Week blues'.

And his promise of a monorail to colleges
on the edge of the city was an apparent tribute to the long-running TV 
series The Simpsons, in which a conman swindles Springfield by promising
a glittering new transport system.

His reputation turned around after he wrote a serious piece for the newspaper The Oxford Student outlining a deeper vision.

True statesman: Louis Trup surprised everyone by winning the race at Oxford University

He said: 'I still can’t believe people call me the "joke candidate"', adding: 'I am clearly not a careerist – a quick Google search of my name will show how unlikely I am to ever get a job anywhere where there is widely available internet access.

'That’s good. OUSU positions should not be seen as stepping stones. We should have fun students working for fun students, not un-fun student politicians working towards a cosy Labour seat in 20 years.'

Mr Trup won a landslide 1,685 votes to become president of the Oxford University Student Union - 710 more than his rival Jane Cahill, the Labour candidate.

His first reaction was 'What the f*** just happened?' amid noisy celebrations at the bar in Brasenose College.

Fomer Oxford Student Union presidents 
include Will Straw, the son of former foreign secretary Jack, who protested 
against his father's tuition fee policy in 2003.

But the union has always struggled against the more high-profile Oxford Union debating society, some whose past presidents went on to become Prime Ministers including Ted Heath.

Other former presidents include Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, William Hague, broadcaster Michael Crick and the late investigative journalist Paul Foot.

Mr Trup was endorsed by red-top student newspaper The Tab - which duly declared it was 'The Tab wot won it'.

News editor of The Tab Zachary Spiro said: 'Trup made a refreshing change from 
the identi-kit lefty non-candidates who keep getting elected, and to be 
honest, OUSU was long overdue for a wake-up call to make it realise that
it needs to be relevant to students again.

'Also, St. Hugh's college is really really far away, and Trup's monorail was the only policy offering a real solution.'

But others did not see the funny side. Student Matthew Davies tweeted: 'Ashamed to be an Oxford student tonight.'

Influence: Red-top student newspaper The Tab was delighted with Mr Trup's victory - echoing The Sun's famous front page of 1992 in which it claimed credit for John Major's election success
