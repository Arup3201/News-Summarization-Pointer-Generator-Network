Shocking video taken at a protest in St. Louis shows several demonstrators taunting police just hours after two NYPD officers were killed in an apparent 'retribution' killing following the Michael Brown and Eric Garner grand jury decisions.

Bassem Masri has made headlines before for his protest tactics and Saturday he appeared to stay true to form in a video in which he chants at police, 'Pigs in a blanket smell like bacon.'

Hours before, Ismaaiyl Brinsley shot and killed NYPD officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos after posting he'd soon be 'putting pigs in a blanket.'

A group of protesters in St. Louis taunted police officers with the chant 'pigs in a blanket smell like bacon' on Saturday night just hours after a

Masri has gained a wide internet following for the protests he routinely live streams on the site Ustream.

His chants, in which he was joined with several others during part of a Saturday march, immediately won him a barrage of internet attacks.

Masri rebuffed them all, tweeting, 'They offended about the "Pigs in a Blanket" chant, then applaud #IamDarrenWilson bracelets & constant demonization of every1In their way #Ferguson.'

Despite the shocking nature of his chants, Masri--who wears a scarf around his face during protests in solidarity with the Palestinian resistance--maintains in other tweets that he's against any sort of violence. 

'I can't speak4why the guy did what he did in NY,' he tweeted. 'For future references we in #Ferguson dont want any 1 2 die at all. keep the moral high ground.' 

Meanwhile, an eyewitness who spoke to The Daily Beast said that 'a lot of people were clapping and laughing' following the murder of the two police officers.

'Some were saying, "They deserved it," and another was shouting at the cops, "Serves them right because you mistreat people!”' said the man, identified as Carlos.

Civil rights leaders Sunday condemned the ambush killings of two New York police officers and expressed fear that the backlash over the bloodshed could derail the protest movement that has grown out of the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner.

In the raw hours following the killing of the officers, police union officials and politicians accused those who have protested the deaths of Garner and Brown of fanning anti-police fervor. Patrick Lynch, president of the Patrolman's Benevolent Association in New York, said there was 'blood on the hands' of demonstrators and elected officials who have criticized police tactics.

The Garner and Brown families issued statements repudiating the officers' killings, while civil rights leaders took to the airwaves to try to put some distance between the movement and the crime.

'To link the criminal insanity of a lone gunman to the peaceful protests and aspirations of many people across the country, including the attorney general, the mayor and even the president, is simply not fair,' NAACP President Cornell William Brooks said on CBS's Face the Nation.

Brooks said the shootings were "certainly not a step forward" for the movement.
