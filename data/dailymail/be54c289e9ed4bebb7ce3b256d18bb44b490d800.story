A lesbian couple were told they could not rent a flat - because they did not constitute a 'family'.

Church minister Keith Price allegedly refused to let Kira Izzard and Laura Cull rent a flat next to Ms Cull's sister and nephew because of the pair's sexuality.

Ms Cull said she felt 'numb' and 'sick' at the decision made last week, and was uncertain about its legalities.

The couple, from Douglas, the Isle of Man, were stunned when they were told they did not constitute a 'family'

The couple, from Douglas, who have been together four years, were told that the Civil Partnership Act had been enacted on the Isle of Man.

But an Equality Bill - which would make it illegal to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation - was yet to be ratified, The Independent reported.

The church leader, from the Independent Methodist Church, who made the decision has now denied being homophobic, the BBC reported.

Keith Price claims his decision was based on his religious views and not prejudice.

'We are not homophobic but we do have a stance on the sexuality,' Mr Price said.

He added: 'We understood that they were not a family so we said we couldn't proceed (with renting the property to them).

'We believe that God has a plan for our lives within the context of marriage, the scripture is quite clear in its teaching on this,' the BBC reported.

Outrage: The Isle of Man's Chief Minister Alan Bell has branded the decision 'bigoted'

But his decision prompted outrage from the Island's Chief Minister, Allan Bell, who branded the decision 'bigoted'.

He said: 'I am extremely disappointed that this type of ugly, outdated prejudice survives after all the work that has been done over the past 20 years or so to make the island a more tolerant place.

'I do believe our society today is generally much more tolerant than it used to be.

'But this incident shows there are still isolated pockets of bigotry that can only be tackled through legislation,' The Independent reported.

An online petition demanding the introduction of the UK's Equality Act 2010 has now been launched and already gathered more than 1,200 signatures.
