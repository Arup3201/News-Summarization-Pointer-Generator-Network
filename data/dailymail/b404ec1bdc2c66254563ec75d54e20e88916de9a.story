A sports anchor's argument with an 'erratic' house painter who has pulled a gun on clients in the past led to him being shot 10 times outside of his suburban home.

KFMB-TV's Kyle Kraska, 48, hired shooting suspect Mike Montana to work on the outside of his house in the Scripps Ranch area of San Diego months before he was gunned down in his Mercedes on Tuesday. 

The broadcaster was dissatisfied with the job so paid the 54-year-old for the work he had done before the pair parted ways.

For months the disgruntled Montana, who has pulled a gun on customers who owed him money in the past, left threatening notes at the journalist's home.

His anger reached a tipping point earlier this week when he approached Kraska in his car and shot him 10 times through the back window.

Personality: Montana, described as 'erratic' by past clients, began leaving threatening notes at Kraska's home after the two parted ways. The sports anchor was said to be unhappy with the work done on his home 

Montana, who surrendered to police hours after the incident, has had issues with working relationships in the past, leading him to pull a gun on people who owed him money and leave violent phone messages after a company told him to start one of his jobs again. 

The CBS affiliate station said Kraska's injuries were serious but his prognosis was good. He was recovering after surgery for 10 gun wounds, including shots to the leg and stomach. 

Todd Villalobos, a KFMB sports producer and friend of Kraska, told the station that the anchor hired Montana to paint the outside of his house after seeing him work in the neighborhood. Kraska was dissatisfied with the work, paid the painter for what he had done, and the two agreed to part ways.

Months later, Montana began leaving notes on Kraska's door, Villalobos said, according to KFMB.

San Diego police Lt. Scott Wahl said the dispute involved the painting of the anchor's house but didn't offer specifics.

Montana surrendered to authorities Tuesday night, hours after the shooting and a SWAT standoff at his home in suburban El Cajon. He was booked into San Diego County jail and was scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday on a charge of attempted murder.

Kraska, 48, is the sports director at KFMB, where he has worked since 1999. He has been a fixture in San Diego homes as the station's evening sports anchor since 2003 and hosts the San Diego Chargers postgame show.

The Boston native previously worked for television stations in Los Angeles; Sarasota, Florida; Tampa, Florida; El Paso, Texas; and Albany, New York, according to KFMB. 

Hands up: The moment Montana surrendered to authorities on Tuesday evening was captured on camera 

Outlook: Kraska's injuries were serious, but his employer KFMB-TV confirmed he is recovering and his prognosis is good. He has worked at the station since 1998 and is a fixture in San Diego homes

He began his career as weekend sports anchor in Watertown, New York, during his senior year at Syracuse University.

Montana identified himself as self-employed and the sole owner of Superior Painting Corp. in a filing for personal bankruptcy protection in January 2014. He listed assets of $11,030, liabilities of $38,878 and monthly income of $2,012.

Superior Painting's California business license was suspended in October 2013 for an unpaid balance of $1,951, said Tami Grimes, a spokeswoman for the state Franchise Tax Board.

Robert Nicoll, who lives next door to Montana, told the U-T San Diego newspaper that Montana spoke to him about pulling a gun on three people who confronted him at work to demand that he stop seeking payment from a customer. Montana said the customer owed him money.

Frank Coit, a senior manager at Lone Star General Contracting in Santee, told the newspaper that the company refused to pay Montana in full for a job that was incomplete and needed to be redone, eliciting threatening phone messages from Montana that included mention of a gun.

'He was a very erratic personality,' Coit said.

Jail records do not list an attorney for Montana, who didn't immediately respond to an email sent through jail system.

San Diego police said the attack was unrelated to any other crimes and described it as 'targeted.'

'(The suspect) was looking for him,' said Wahl. 'He wasn't looking for someone else.'
