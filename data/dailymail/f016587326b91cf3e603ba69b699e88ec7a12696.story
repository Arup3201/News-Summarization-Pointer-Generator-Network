It is the most coveted award in Hollywood - reducing winners and losers in equal measure to tears when the iconic gold statue is handed out.

But even the stars who don’t win a Oscar at this weekend’s ceremony won’t go home empty handed.

A Los Angeles-based marketing firm will be handing out gift bags worth $45,000 to all the nominees and presenters at the prestigious event on Sunday night.

Luxury Consolation: In the goodie bag is a $12,000 choice of holiday between Lizard Island in Australia or El Questro Homestead in Mexico

Known as swag bags, among the items 
included are trips to Hawaii and Mexico, personal training 
sessions, condoms, a bottle of tequila, cosmetic treatments, and a one-year membership to London’s Heathrow Airport’s 
private VIP service.

The confirmation of condoms in this year’s gift bag has raised eyebrows amongst some.

High Fashion Tennis Shoes: $850.00 Carlitos Brand is a new line of tennis shoes hand-illustrated by Jeanette Longoria.  Each nominee will receive one pair of limited edition shoes ($350) plus a gift certificate for a one-of-a-kind customized pair ($500)

Stylish Electric Cigarettes. Losers will be able to satisfy their nicotine cravings with a set of $40 NJOY electric cigarettes

Gleener The Ultimate Fuzz Remover is part of the pack to ensure that the next time the loser is nominated they look their best

A limited edition Dan Duff artwork is included in the $45,000 goodie bag for those who do not walk home with an Oscar

This year’s goody bags also include a $12,000 trip to Australia, a 
$600 acupuncture appointment and a package of 10 personal training 
sessions valued at $850 from marketing firm Distinctive Assets.

In addition there are circus lessons for the nominee’s children 
worth $400 are also included, as well as a $5,000 face-lift procedure.

They will also be given free hair 
care products by Phyto, skincare cosmetics by Lierac and, at the lower end of the scale, a $1 bottle of 
Windex glass cleaning fluid.

The prizes only can be used by the 
nominees who receive them and cannot be given to friends, according to 
Distinctive Assets.

'It was a way for us to reach the exact talent we wanted [major 
nominees] without having to deal with the immense production challenges 
of the Hollywood/Highland area during Oscar week,' said Distinctive Assets 
CEO Lash Fary to ABCNews.com.

Those nominated in the major acting categories, Best Director as well as host Seth McFarlane will have the packs delivered to their doors the day after the awards.

Stylish Consolation: Hickies are an elastic lacing system that allows you to turn any shoe into a slip on - perfect for any nominee who wants to change into their running shoes to make a quick getaway

Chocolatines confectioners include their Yellow Gold Diamond Collection, of sake-infused $100 chocolates in the swag bag

'Even Hollywood’s most acclaimed stars are disappointed over this particular loss,' said Fary.

'And when our consolation gift shows up the next day, we like to think it is welcome distraction.'

Celebrities who receive gifts and free trips at awards shows are 
expected to declare them to the Inland Revenue Service as income and pay
 the appropriate taxes.

The Distinctive Assets gift bag is not endorsed by the Academy 
but has been creating consolation goodie bags for 11 years now. The bags
 are delivered to the losing nominees to their homes directly or through
 their agents or publicists.

It has become something of a 
tradition for A-list stars to receive a treasure chest of goodies at the
 Oscars.

Only one nominee can take home the Oscar - but losers will have the blow of defeat tempered with one of these $45,000 swag bags

Brands and manufacturers hope that the celebrities will be seen
 wearing or using their products and ensure free publicity.

The gift bags have been put 
together over the past 11 years by US company Distinctive Assets, with 
the cost of the packages having slowly risen.

In 2003, nominees received $8,000 worth of items, including mobile phones, cameras, designer 
clothes and jewellery.

The 2004 gift bag included a 
holiday at a luxury resort in Mexico.

Gwyneth Paltrow, who presented an 
award at the Oscars that year, was said to have used the holiday for her
 honeymoon with Coldplay singer Chris Martin.

Actress Calista Flockhart once 
received a Dritti T-shirt in a gift basket from Distinctive Assets and 
loved it so much that she wore it for an entire episode of Ally McBeal.

Similarly, another T-shirt designer saw their gifts end up on Beyonce 
Knowles on the cover of Ebony magazine.

In recent years, stars are said to
 have been worried about alienating recession-hit fans by being seen 
with heavily laden gift bags.

However, Lord of the Rings actor Sir Ian McKellen is one of the stars who has spoken of his delight at his gift haul.

‘They’re the most wonderful goodies,’ he explained. ‘They keep you going for a year.’

Lash Fry, founder of Distinctive 
Assets, said: ‘It’s first come, first served, because we do offer 
product exclusivity.

'We’re always looking for new and unusual products, 
it’s not always about the most expensive.

‘We’ve got things at both ends of 
the spectrum and everything in between, stuff for guys and stuff for 
girls. More is more is our philosophy.’
