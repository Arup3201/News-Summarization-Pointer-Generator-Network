Want to be the first to see the latest television programmes? Don’t bother turning on your TV.

BBC shows are to be made available on the internet before they are broadcast for traditional audiences.

During a 12-month trial, a range of programmes will premiere online through the BBC’s iPlayer service.

The shows – which will include some 40 hours of programming across a variety of genres – will only be screened on television afterwards.

In the past, iPlayer has typically offered a ‘catch-up’ service rather than the chance to see new material.

But the BBC has already run a number of pilot comedy shows online and one of these, Impractical Jokers, was turned into a BBC3 series.

Minutes from a BBC Trust meeting released yesterday said: ‘Members noted that the Trust’s Strategy and Approvals Committee had approved the launch of a trial for up to 12 months which would allow up to 40 hours of programming across a range of genres to be shown on BBC Online before transmission on linear television channels.’

Although the plans have been approved, no details have been released about which shows will be included or when the trial will start.

At the moment, viewers do not need a TV licence to watch iPlayer as long as it is more than two hours since the programme was broadcast on TV. But a licence is required for the ‘watch live’ option, which shows programmes currently being aired.
