A convicted conman who evaded authorities for more than a year lived like a monk and dressed like a hippie to look after his sick mum in northern New South Wales, his lawyer claims.

Peter Foster - who helped purchase two apartments for the wife of former British prime minister Tony Blair in 2002 - was arrested on Tuesday near Byron Bay and will not be reunited with the 83-year-old matriarch for at least 18 months.

The 52-year-old was caught after police received a tip-off from a media organisation, which had been secretly filming him for some time while he was living at a house at Ewingsdale.

Peter Foster, 52, was arrested in Byron Bay on Tuesday afternoon (pictured here in 2007)

Foster disappeared in September last year while awaiting a Federal Court decision about whether he flouted a 2005 ban from the weight-loss industry after he conned $6 million from 90 investors in the SensaSlim scam.

He was found guilty and sentenced in his absence to a three-year jail term, with at least 18 months to be served behind bars.

The convicted conman had previously fled police in Fiji and Vanuatu, but his latest time on the lam was spent living incognito on NSW's north coast.

He gained weight, grew his hair long and dyed it blonde, sported a grey beard and blended in with the region's hippies.

He was arrested in bare feet under some shrubby trees on a bush property.

Foster faced Tweed Heads Local Court on Wednesday, pleading guilty to assaulting police and resisting arrest.

Defence lawyer Terry Fisher told the magistrate Foster had been 'living like a monk' for a year, and just wanted to see him mum.

'He's a bit shell-shocked at the moment, but his main concern is that he gets reunited with his mother because he's been looking after his mother for the last 11 months,' Mr Fisher told reporters outside the court.

Foster has previously been jailed in the UK, the US and Australia because of his forbidden involvement in the slimming industry

He looked dramatically different on Tuesday when he was captured by a number of officers on the NSW coast

Asked why Foster chose northern NSW as the location to care for his mother, he said it was because the area was one of the most beautiful parts of Australia.

'He's from the Gold Coast, so I suppose he wanted to reside there like just about everybody else in Australia,' he said.

But police have offered their own version of Foster's most recent movements.

They say he had been hiding out in northern NSW for at least the past month, but until a tip-off from what they called a 'community source' did not have a specific location for the fugitive.

In 2002 Cherie Blair, wife of of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair allegedly purchased two apartments with the help of the Australian conman

During his time in Britain, he befriended Carole Caplin, Cherie Blair’s fitness 'guru' which is how he came to get close to the Blair family

Police said they had no information to suggest Foster had been caring for his mother at the 'substantial' and 'wealthy looking' Ewingsdale property where officers say he was living with another man.

Foster will now be taken to Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre in Queensland to begin what will be at least another 18 months behind bars. 

His dishevelled appearance during his arrest was a stark contrast to the sharp figure he cut while promoting his worthless Bai Lin Tea slimming products in Britain more than 30 years ago.

The 52-year-old self-confessed ‘international man of mischief’, became the central figure in the infamous 2002 Cheriegate scandal.

In footage to be aired on Tuesday's A Current Affair, police wrestled Foster to the ground and one of the officers was heard warning his colleagues: 'He's got a gun.' In fact, Foster was unarmed.

He was quickly subdued and dragged away to a police van – but the first stop was not a police cell.

Foster was jailed for false advertising in the UK and later faced similar punishment in the US

Instead, the fugitive was taken to hospital after he suffered what a police spokesman described as 'a turn', the nature of which was not known, while being arrested.

Foster failed to appear in court for the sentencing hearing late last year and was judged to be in contempt of court, after which he remained ‘on the run’ for a year, he is certain to be ordered to serve added jail time.

The man who made millions of pounds by selling franchises for weight-loss products – which were found in scientific tests to be ineffective – first made headlines in Britain in the 1980s when he dated models and even took one on a six-month tour of Europe in a Rolls-Royce.

Later he began an affair with fitness 'guru' Carole Caplin who was friends with former British prime minister Tony Blair's wife, Cherie.

It was through Miss Caplin that he agreed to help the-then Labour Prime Minister’s wife to purchase two flats in Bristol for a discounted price. It resulted in Mrs Blair sending him an email saying he was ‘a star’. 

When she learned of his notoriety, she tearfully admitted her mistake in public.

Foster has boasted to the Daily Mail that he has been in prison in Britain, the US and Australia but insisted he had never been convicted of fraud. Rather, he said, he had been found guilty of advertising misdemeanours.
