George Katcharian, pictured and Cemal Esmene were convicted at Norwich 
Crown Court yesterday

Two con artists have been found guilty of defrauding one Britain's wealthiest men out of £12million by exploiting his deep religious beliefs.

George Katcharian, 60, and Cemal Esmene, 56, were convicted at Norwich Crown Court yesterday of tricking former car dealership businessman Graham Dacre into parting with a vast chunk of his £70million fortune.

After a complex four-week trial jurors took a day to convict Katcharian and Esmene of conspiring to defraud philanthropist Mr Dacre, who had been persuaded to hand over the cash after being told it would make vast sums for his charitable ventures.

In addition Iranian-born Katcharian was also found guilty of conspiring to defraud a German church of £8million.

Esmene was convicted of laundering the cash after a huge four-year probe by detectives.

Born-again Christian Mr Dacre, who was 
ranked at number 793 on the Sunday Times Rich List, was convinced by the
pair that the money would be invested in a secret trading platform that would reap huge returns.

Mr Dacre, 60, made his fortune 
through car dealerships and sold the Lind Automotive Group for £108m in 
2006 to fund Christian projects, which include the Open Academy and the £12million Open Youth 
Venue, in his home city Norwich.

Throughout the trial the pair insisted they were innocent and blamed an associate called Ian Yorkshire, 62.

Earlier this year Yorkshire was convicted of laundering the money which the international gang persuaded Mr Dacre to hand over in May 2008.

Police will now set about trying to retrieve the millions that has been taken from Mr Dacre through the Proceeds of Crime Act.

It is believed much of the cash ended up in northern Cyprus and Australia.

Norfolk detectives are understood to be talking to their counterparts in those countries as they bid to track down the money.

They also believe Esmene spent some of the cash on homes in the upmarket village of East Molesey, in Surrey.

The court heard that Mr Dacre failed to heed warnings from his adviser Anthony Bunker that he was falling for a scam.

The criminals transferred his money to a Swiss bank account before sending it on around the world.

Mr Dacre was fed lie after lie, jurors were told.

He met Cypriot Esmene at a Swiss bank in June 2008 in a desperate bid to find out why there was a delay in his money being invested in the scheme.

After finally losing patience with the con artists' excuses, Mr Dacre reported the fraud to Norfolk Police in December 2008.

Acting Detctive Inspector Rob Foreman, head of Norfolk Police's Economic Crime Unit, said last night: 'This is a successful conclusion to what has been a very complex and protracted investigation.

'The offenders targeted individuals and organisations that believed in ethical investment.

'They falsely persuaded them that a portion of their profits from the investments would benefit humanitarian projects aimed at helping some of the poorest and most disadvantaged people around the world.

'In reality the money funded the lifestyles of the offenders.'

Katcharian, a Danish citizen who was tracked down in Germany after an arrest warrant was issued, will be sentenced with Esmene on Monday.

In May, Alan Hunt, 65, of Poole, Dorset, and Arthur Ford-Batey, 62, of Carlisle, Cumbria, were convicted of conspiracy to defraud Mr Dacre while Ian Yorkshire, of Brighton, East Sussex, was found guilty of conspiracy to money launder.

They were jailed for a total of 23 years.

Investigating officer Detective Constable Chris Gay, of Norfolk Police, said: 'Although the amounts lost by the victims in this matter were substantial, and the way in which they were convinced to part with their funds was complex, it was essentially a simple confidence trick.

'The principle remains that if an investment proposal looks too good to be true then it almost certainly is.'
