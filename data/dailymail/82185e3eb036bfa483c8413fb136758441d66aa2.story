Repairs to the crumbling Houses of Parliament could cost taxpayers more than £3billion.

The historic Palace of Westminster is in such poor condition that MPs and peers may have to move out for five years while works are carried out.

Officials say the landmark by the Thames will not survive without significant investment.

Among the problems are leaking roofs and pipes, ancient electrics and plumbing, asbestos, subsidence, badly-damaged stonework and fire risks.

The building, which has housed peers since 1847 and MPs since 1852, has not had a major renovation since the 1940s, when German bomb damage was dealt with. 

Richard Ware, who is leading the restoration project, said politicians and their staff would end up ‘working in a ruin’ if nothing was done.

‘We’re moving backwards,’ he told BBC2’s Newsnight. ‘The building is getting older faster than we can deal with it. It is on borrowed time.’

Restoration costs were put at about £1.4billion in a 2012 report. But sources say the ‘working assumption’ now is that the bill will reach £3billion.

An independent report opens up the possibility of keeping the building open and MPs working there while repairs are carried out.

But this is likely to be rejected because it might extend the timetable to up to 50 years. 

A second report setting out the costs of the different options has been completed, but will not be published until after next year’s election.

MPs and peers will then have to decide how the work should be carried out. It is expected to begin in 2020 or 2021, and may require legislation. 

The huge cost and disruption make the decision a politically charged one and a quango similar to the Olympic Delivery Authority is likely to be created to oversee the project.

Parliamentary officials stress that it is impossible to put a firm figure on the cost at this stage because no decision has been taken about which option to pursue.

The Palace of Westminster was designed by architect Charles Barry after the previous building was destroyed by fire in 1834.

Grade I listed, it has 100 staircases and more than 1,100 rooms. It is a Unesco world heritage site.
