An 'obsessively jealous' former police officer who brutally stabbed his pregnant girlfriend to death has been jailed for a minimum of 28 years.

Jonathan Sutton, 40, wrongly believed Emma Siswick was cheating on him when he stabbed her 81 times in 'anger and possessive rage' at the home they shared in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire.

Sutton also stabbed two boys, aged nine and 11, in an attack that was described as 'little short of torture'.

'Horrific': Three of the rooms in the home that Ms Siswick and Jonathan Sutton shared in Huddersfield, pictured above,  were covered in blood following the attack in May this year 

The defendant pleaded guilty to Ms Siswick's murder and the grievous bodily harm of the two boys at Leeds Crown Court today.

The court heard that Sutton initially attacked his partner with a glass after discovering a text message on her phone and deciding that she was being unfaithful to him. 

He then stabbed her with a knife in the basement kitchen before attacking the two boys in other parts of the house.

Miss Siswick called for help and the older boy heard her cries, the court heard. It was then Sutton turned his attention to him.

The elder of the two boys was able to attract the attention of neighbours - who called the police - when he ran from the house screaming and bleeding profusely.  

Three rooms of the house on Reinwood Road, Huddersfield, where the attack took place, were left covered in blood.

In the hours before the attack he had consumed seven or eight beers, some wine amphetamine and M-Cat.

Mr Justice Edis told Sutton: 'You have committed three offences which are as serious as it's possible to imagine.'

The judge continued: 'Looking at the photographs of the house where all this happened ... is a truly horrific experience. 

'Jealous': Sentencing Sutton, pictured, Mr Justic Edis said that he was 'an obsessively jealous man' who had lost his temper

'There are three different sites in that property where very serious assaults with knives were carried out. There's blood everywhere.

'You inflicted 81 separate cut injuries to Emma. She fought you to try to save herself.'

Mr Justice Edis said Ms Siswick, 37, was pregnant at the time of her murder but the couple, who had been together just over three years, had discussed terminating the pregnancy.

He said there had been no previous assaults in the relationship, despite frequent arguments.

The murder happened after Sutton discovered a 'harmless' text message and decided Ms Siswick, who had worked in a school for disabled children for a decade, was being unfaithful to him, which she was not.

'Your motive was anger and possessive rage,' Mr Justice Edis said.

'In all of your relationships, you have been obsessively jealous of the women you lived with, checking them and their conduct in ways which were demeaning and humiliating and no doubt, to them, deeply unsettling. 

'Because of your weakness in that regard, it appears that you simply lost your temper and in anger, without pre-mediation, killed her.'

He added: 'You were an obsessively jealous man who lost his temper.'

Mr Justice Edis described the attacks on the children as 'truly horrific' and told Sutton he had caused them 'irreparable harm'.

He said: 'Exactly what you intended to do to them may never really be known. What you certainly did was to inflict painful, if not life-threatening, injuries. If that's what you intended to do it was little short of torture.'

He added: 'You have left them with physical scars which they will see every day of their lives to remind them of what happened that day. 

'We can only speculate about the mental scars which you have left with them as well.'

Sutton received concurrent life sentences for each of the three counts he admitted. He was told he would serve a minimum of eight years for the two charges of wounding with intent and a minimum of 28 years for Ms Siswick's murder. 

West Yorkshire Police welcomed the outcome of today's hearing.

Detective Chief Inspector Adrian Taylor, senior investigating officer, said: 'At 9.30pm on the night of May 18 this year we were called to a property in Huddersfield to reports of an ongoing domestic incident.

Torture: The court heard that Sutton inflicted painful injuries on the two boys. Above left, an officer outside the house in Hudfdersfield and, right, officers enter the property

'What we found there was much worse - a 37-year-old woman had been killed and two children had suffered serious stab wounds.

'Following a short investigation, Jonathan Sutton was arrested and charged with the murder of Emma Siswick and the grievous bodily harm of the two children.

'We may never know the reasons why he carried out this brutal attack, but we welcome this guilty plea for Emma and the two young children he seriously assaulted. 

'We hope that her family can now start to rebuild their lives and move on from this horrific incident.'

A spokesperson for Ms Siswick's family thanked 'all her family and friends for their unwavering support throughout this devastating time'.
