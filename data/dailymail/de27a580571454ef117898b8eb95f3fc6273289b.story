These portly penguins are providing inspiration to those who have made a New Year's resolution to get into shape after indulging over the Christmas holiday.

With camera-happy tourists looking on, the chubby birds are paraded through the snow at Japan’s Asahiyama Zoo twice a day from December to March to help them slim down.

The 30-minute waddle is designed to keep the penguins fit and healthy and fend off obesity during the winter months when they tend to be less active and accumulate more fat.

The Penguin Walk has become a world-renowned attraction with tourists flocking to the zoo to witness the extraordinary event.

Luckily the portly penguins are accustomed to the limelight and appear to enjoy the attention as they pose for snaps, although some appeared dishevelled.

Photographer Paul Brown, from London, snapped these shots when he made a special trip to the zoo on the northern island of Hokkaido.

The 51-year-old said: ‘This is the first time I have seen the Penguin Walk. I heard about it a while ago and have always wanted to see and photograph it as it looks such fun and it really was.

‘There was a great atmosphere and everyone there seemed to be very happy. The keepers walk the penguins twice a day around a fixed course through the zoo, which takes about half an hour.’

Paul said the walk was a huge hit with visitors and he encountered visitors from Japan and countries all over the world.

He added: ‘No other zoo I know of has a Penguin Walk like this. It really is unique.

Mr Brown said the flightless birds were relaxed and had the appearance of a group of friends who were out for a casual stroll in the snow

‘The children loved the penguins, they were waving and clapping their hands but were also very well behaved as staff told them to stay seated so as not to scare the penguins.

‘The penguins were really professional and ignored their adoring fans and the constant clicking of cameras.

‘They had obviously done this before and didn't need any coaxing along the path. They stayed clear of the crowd at all times, but never once did they appear scared, taking the whole event in their stride, or should that be waddle.’

‘From time to time one or another of them would stop and stretch its neck and wings, give them a little shake and then move on.

‘It was really well organised and they had people with signs in Japanese and English, walking ahead of the penguins telling people with cameras not to use flash. It was really fun to watch.’
