A disabled woman with a weak bladder was left 'totally humiliated' when she wet herself in the middle of a JobCentre reception because staff refused to let her use the toilet.

Rebecca Weston, who suffers from cerebral palsy, wanted the ground to swallow her up after the incident at the JobCentrePlus in Mitcham, south London. 

The former nursery worker for Mitcham Council had to go to the centre  for an interview to have a benefits review meeting with a member of staff on September 29.

But soon after she arrived at the London Road building she quickly realised she needed the toilet.

She said: 'I asked the security guard if I could use the toilet and he just said no.

'I told him 'I'm registered disabled and have a weak bladder which is unlikely to hold'. I asked him to please let me in or else I was going to wet myself on his floor.

'He thought I was threatening to wet myself and he just said 'you're not using it.

'He told me to go to the coffee shop next door but I was desperate and I told him 'I'm not going to make it.'

Miss Weston attempted to make her way to the coffee shop but before she even reached the JobCentre door she said she could feel urine running down her leg.

'When I wet myself I really wet myself and it was pouring down and running off my shoes,' she said

'My feet were squelching. It was the most humiliating moment of my life. I wanted the ground to swallow me up, I just wanted to die.'

She said other  JobCentre clients were left speechless by the incident.

'It is bad enough when this happens to me in private but there were people watching - it was awful,' she said.

'It is the attitude that upsets me. He (the security guard) thought I was just some stupid little girl being difficult but that wasn't the case.'

Miss Weston was diagnosed with her crippling condition at the age of two and suffers poor balance and pain in her legs.

She said  the way she was treated by staff as she stood shaking in the reception was 'appalling'.

'I was horrified by this point. I was hyperventilating and in a right old state,' she said.

'Then the woman I was due to be meeting came from behind her desk and said 'well obviously I'm not going to see you in this state so you will have to go home'.

'I was totally humiliated. It hurts me every day.' 

A spokesman for the JobCentre said the site does not have a public toilet and Ms Weston was advised to go to a nearby cafe.

Ms Weston admitted swearing  following the incident, but said she was frustrated by the attitude of staff.

A spokeswoman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: 'Jobcentres don't have public toilets, but our staff will always try to accommodate people's individual needs where possible.

'However people should also be aware that we do not tolerate abusive behaviour towards our staff.'
