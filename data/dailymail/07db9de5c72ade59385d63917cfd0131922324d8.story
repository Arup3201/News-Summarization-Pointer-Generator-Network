A video has emerged of a motorist brandishing a baseball bat to confront members of a suburban Houston cycling team after allegedly hitting one of them with his car.

Sherman Clark, 74, of Conroe, can be seen in the smartphone video wielding the aluminum bat after what the cyclists claim was a road rage incident where he ran one biker off the road and brake-checked another who seriously injured his wrist.

The cyclists claim to be innocent victims of the old man’s anger, however, he disputes their version of events.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Ready to rumble: Sherman Clark says the bat was for self-defense, the cyclist are not so sure

Members of the Woodlands Cycling Club Race Team claim 10 cyclists were riding single-file down the road where the altercation began, according to Fox 25.

Cyclists say Mr Clark pulled in front of them and hit the brakes.

Once he saw me in his mirror, he veered right and slammed on the brakes. I had no time to react,’  Rick Savageau told KHOU.

'Rick has nowhere to go because he's going 25mph,' Cyclist Steve Schoger told Click2Houston.

'Bang!
He hits the pickup truck. He goes flying off of his bike. Ends up 
breaking his wrist and having serious knee and shoulder injury as well,'
Mr Schroger added.

‘I’m just going, this isn’t really happening is it?’ Mr Schoger said to KHOU. ‘This is like out of the movies.’

Booked: Mr Clark was handed two felony charges for the altercation

Frustrated: Mr Clark says his frustration with the bikers has been growing for some time

Mr Sauvageau fractured his wrist and injured both his shoulder and knee, he told the station.

The video picks up shortly after Mr Clark stopped.

Seen in the video holding a bat, the grandfather is asked why he has it.

‘To protect myself,’ Mr Clark replies.

‘What did we do wrong?’ The cyclist asks.

‘You were riding all over the damn road for one thing,’ an agitated Mr Clark snaps, waving the bat in the direction of the person taking the video.

‘You drove right past us, no problem,’’ another cyclist can be heard saying. ‘You got in front of us, didn't you… And then somebody tried, yeah, and you ran them off the road?’

‘Yes, you're damn right,’ he replies.

'All over the damn road!': The grandfather is upset they always race on a local road, flouting traffic laws and ignoring motorists

Escape plan: The retiree hopped in his truck to drive off, threatening to run over cyclists if they didn't move

The next clip shows the retiree get into his pickup and drive away as cyclists kick the side of truck while he runs over one of the bikes, which local media estimated costs $5,000.

Mr Clark defended his actions to MailOnline and disputed the cyclists version of events.

‘I pulled up to the side of them and rolled down my window and hollered ‘why don’t y’all get out of our neighbourhood?’ he said.

He says he was surrounded by the cyclists when one of them slammed into the back of the truck because he was going too fast.

He claims they have exchanged words with him in the past.

‘This guy that was shooting the video was questioning me like an attorney,’ he added.

‘They had my truck, totally circled, I got out with a baseball bat to have something to protect myself because there’s 10 of them, one of me,’ he explained.

‘I got back in my truck, said ‘I’m leaving, you can’t make stay here. You better get out from in front of my truck or I guess I’ll have to run over you.’

The riders moved, one left his bike and Mr Clark says he ran over it while leaving, as shown in the video.

Also angry: Enraged cyclists kick the side of Mr Clark's truck as he drives away

Peaceful: The road where the fracas occurred

Investigators spoke to everyone at the scene besides Mr Clark, he told MailOnline. He was arrested and charged with assault with a deadly weapon and felony criminal mischief.

Mr Clark said that the assault charge was dropped at his Friday morning arraignment, but MailOnline was not able to confirm that with local police.

This was not the first incident Mr Clark has had with the group, he said he has exchanged profanities with them in the past as he grew frustrated with their ignorance of traffic laws and indifference to motorists.

'This club comes out here and rides around and around and around our circle,' he lamented,'they make a nuisance of themselves.'
