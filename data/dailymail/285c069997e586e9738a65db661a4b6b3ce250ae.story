Two teenage boys have been caught on film performing a dangerous stunt on a speeding commuter train in New Zealand.

The boys, who risked their lives to hang off a train carriage in New Zealand, were spotted outside Manor Park Station, north of Wellington, on Sunday afternoon.

Footage of the pair’s brazen stunt was posted on Instagram and is now circulating on the internet. Police and rail authorities have condemned the reckless behaviour.

At speeds of over 90kmh the unidentified teenage boys could have easily fallen to their death during the crazy stunt

Police shift commander John Spence said police were astounded by ‘the crazy stunt’ that could have easily killed the boys.

"Falling off a train travelling at 90kmh would have led to serious if not fatal injuries," he told NZ media.

The pair abandoned their joy ride before the train reached the next station.

KiwiRail zero harm manager, Aaron Temperton, said the train could have been travelling at up to 90kmh, a very dangerous speed when people are outside the carriage.

Wellington Metro trains can reach speeds of 110kmh.  

"It is hugely irresponsible. People can die and have died from things such as this. We cannot understand why they would put themselves in harm's way," Mr Temperton told NZ media outlets.

Shocking: Police and rail authorities are shocked by the crazy stunt which was caught on film 

He said anyone participating in behaviour like this could be prosecuted for trespassing and slapped with a massive fine.

KiwiRail Metro manager, David Shepard, reminded everyone that actions like this can have consequences for a number of people, including staff and other commuters.

"Trespassing on the rail corridor is a huge problem and people who do this, whether it's being on the rail corridor or riding on the back of a train, run the risk of not only killing themselves but also traumatising the people who then have to deal with the consequences of their actions," he said to NZ reporters.

Not cool: Rail authorities say other commuters and staff could have been traumatised if the stunt went wrong 

The video footage was captured by Alexey Zhavoronkov while he was with his family on the road between Upper Hutt and Lower Hutt.

He slammed the pairs behaviour wanting to set a good example for his son who also witness the act.

"We're originally from Russia and this kind of madness is more like normal there ... it was a shock to see people here doing it. It's really dangerous ... it was scary," he told NZ reporters. 

The footage has been handed to police and they are searching for the unidentified teens.

Last year the number of reported incidents of trespassing on the rail corridor rose from 288 incidents in 2013 to 418.   

The stunt constitutes trespassing the perpetrators could be slapped with a hefty fine and criminal conviction
