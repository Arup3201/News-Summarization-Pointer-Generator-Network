A 51-year-old California man was charged on Tuesday with bulk cash smuggling after attempting to smuggle $128,547 in his socks as he returned to the U.S. from a brief trip to Mexico.

Antonio Rakigjija and his son Franco were driving through the San Ysidro, California port of entry in a Ford Focus on June 5 when they were stopped by a U.S. Customs agent, who was ‘conducting roving pre-primary operations’ with his ‘Narcotics/Human detection Dog.’

Rakigjija's son told the agent he and his father had been in Mexico for just a few hours ‘for his father's agriculture business.’

Both men twice denied that they were attempting to bring in anything from Mexico that needed to be declared, according to a probable cause statement filed in U.S. District Court in San Diego.

However, after the federal agent discovered a glass jar containing pot in a jacket on the vehicle’s back seat, the Rakigjijas were escorted to a security office to be frisked, reveals The Smoking Gun.

While being patted down, Antonio Rakigjija revealed that he ‘had money in his socks and that the money was for business expenses related to his bean export company.’

He added that the money - the denominations of which are not detailed in court filings - had been wired to a Tijuana currency exchange by a Mexican company with which he does business.
