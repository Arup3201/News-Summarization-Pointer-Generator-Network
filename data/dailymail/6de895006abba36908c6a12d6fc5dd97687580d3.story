A new mother straining to hear her baby let out his first cry instead heard doctors declaring the newborn dead, eight minutes after he was born.

Nikkita Pereira said she struggled to breathe herself, believing she had lost her first child.

But moments later Ziah 'came back to life', gasping his first breath and letting out a cry.

Miss Pereira said: 'Just as I was about to give up, a miracle happened - Ziah drew a deep breath and burst into tears.

Nikkita Pereira said she heard medics at The Royal Free Hospital in London declare her newborn son Ziah dead just eight minutes after his birth by emergency C-section. But moments later her son took his first gasp for breath, bursting into tears

'I
 felt the blood rush through my veins as it hit me that my boy wasn’t 
dead. When I heard him cry it felt like I was breathing again.'

Miss Pereira, 22, was thrilled when she discovered she was pregnant with her first child in June 2011.

The expectant mother started making plans to have a natural birth at home.

But in February 2012, she was taken to hospital after experiencing complications during the early stages of labour.

After 28 hours, doctors were forced to carry out an emergency Caesarean section, detecting baby Ziah's heartbeat was fading.

As medics removed him from the womb, they discovered the newborn was not breathing.

A terrifying eight minutes passed before Miss Pereira claims she heard doctors declare her son dead.

'The silence was deafening as doctors spent eight minutes frantically trying to get him to breathe.

'Then I heard the doctor announce his time of death as 11.02am.

'I felt as if my own heart stopped 
that very instant too, I was completely crushed. It’s difficult to 
express in words how painful it was - I couldn’t bare the thought that 
I’d never get to know my son.'

But a split second later, Ziah miraculously burst into tears.

Miss Pereira, of Wood Green, north 
London, said: 'Now, there’s not a day that goes by where I don’t thank 
my lucky stars for Ziah.

'He’s two-and-a-half now and every day feels like a miracle.'

Miss Pereira and her partner Neil Buchanan, 26, had always planned to have a natural birth.

She said: 'When I fell pregnant I was elated - I couldn’t wait to become a mum and made plans for a perfect natural birth.

'I hoped to go through labour without any painkilling drugs, but when I started feeling contractions I could tell something was wrong.

'Just as I was about to give up, a miracle happened - Ziah drew a deep breath and burst into tears. When I heard him cry it was like I was breathing again'

'After 20 hours of contractions I was
 still only dilated by two centimetres so my mum took me to hospital in a
 taxi where I was hooked up to a monitor for observation.

'Doctors
 quickly discovered that my son’s heartbeat was fading with every 
contraction and before I knew it there were around 20 people in the room
 talking about an emergency Caesarean.

'The umbilical cord had wrapped around his neck in the womb. Doctors had just minutes to get him out alive.

Newborn Ziah was rushed to the neonatal unit where he spent the next eight days.

She
 said: 'He was taken to a completely different floor to mine. I had to 
spend the night surrounded by other mums with their newborn babies, 
while I was so far away from mine.

'I cried the whole night - I hadn’t even seen my child yet.'

Despite his precarious start in life, Ziah is healthy and happy and celebrated his second birthday in February.

A spokesman for The Royal Free Hospital said Ziah's death was never officially recorded, adding he required five inflation breaths for resuscitation

Mrs Pereira said: 'Even now I still sometimes check on him while he is asleep - just to make sure he is still breathing.

'I bought him a baby bracelet, and instead of having his birthday engraved on it, it has the time he was born and then the time that he came back to life.

'I want him to know how lucky he is, and the bracelet means he will never forget.'

A spokesperson for The Royal Free Hospital said Ziah’s death was never officially recorded.

The spokesperson said: 'After the delivery of the baby in question on February 19, 2012, five inflation breaths were needed for resuscitation. He required oxygen. According to our records the baby was not declared dead.

'The baby required neonatal intensive care. He was treated and cared for until discharge on February 27.'
