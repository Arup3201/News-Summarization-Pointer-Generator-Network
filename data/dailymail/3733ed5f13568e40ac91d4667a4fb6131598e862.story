Brainbox? Multiple-graduate Mark Schwalbe claims reverse snobbery is hampering his employment prospects because interviewers laugh him out of the room for being too qualified

A 'completely unemployable' man who has been to university four times says he has been dumped on the scrapheap because he is too clever to work. 

Mark Schwalbe, 52, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, claims to have applied for more than 200 jobs and has been rejected for every one because he has too many qualifications.

Each employer has told him his CV is too good and he is overqualified for the menial jobs he has applied for, he claims.

This is because he has multiple A-levels, a degree and a masters degree as well as an HND and years of experience in the care sector.

He says he has applied unsuccessfully for jobs at fast food chain McDonalds and also high street giants Primark, Wilkinsons and Morrisons.

His frustrations have boiled over to such an extent he wrote to David Cameron and Nick Clegg to tell them about a situation he says is making him miserable.

'I have gone for factory and warehouse jobs where I have been told I am too qualified. Someone even said to me "we don’t want a genius asking why they’re being asked to push a broom".

'I am totally unemployable. I’ve written to David Cameron and Nick Clegg telling them about my situation. There are so many people out there without work.

'If I can’t get a job with my qualifications there is no wonder other people remain on the dole.

'I’ve gone for a huge range of jobs, including minimum wage jobs. I am prepared to get stuck in, I want to work but nobody is interested . I feel terribly isolated.'

But only last week a desperate jobseeker who applied for
15,000 jobs with no success in the past ten years resorted to 
advertising himself by wearing a 'hire me' sandwich board.

Extreme move: Robin Norton stood by the motorway wearing a sandwich board for a day in the hope of finding employment

Robin Norton, from Birmingham, has a Masters degree in history and several NVQs but has been overlooked by an endless slew of employers.

He has now taken drastic action, spending an entire day wearing a sign reading 'hire me please' and walking up and down the M5 slip-road at Bromsgrove junction in Worcestershire.

Mr Schwalbe says he used to work as a care manager but ended up as full time carer for his own mother years ago and has been unable to find a job since.

He is currently working a volunteer at a drugs rehabilitation project.

A spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions said today its work programme and tailored advice and support help people in Mark’s position, and thousands others who have been out of work for up to 15 years had been helped back to work.
