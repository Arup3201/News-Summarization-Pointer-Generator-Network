England Under 19s kept their 100 per cent record in Euro 2015 qualifying with a hard-fought 4-2 win over Belgium as both sides reached the elite round.

Fulham's Patrick Roberts and Middlesbrough's Bradley Fewster grabbed first-half goals before Brandon Barker and Fewster's second secured the win after half-time.

It was a third win in four days in the Luxembourg mini-tournament after England's victories over the hosts (8-0) and Belarus (3-0) had secured qualification. They now face another group mini-tournament in the spring in the hope of reaching the finals in Greece next summer.

Bradley Fewster scores against Belgium in an Under 18 friendly earlier this year - he scored twice this time

Roberts opened the scoring after just nine minutes, curling home a free-kick from the edge of the box - but Dion Cools quickly made it 1-1 when he headed in from a corner.

Fewster restored the lead just after the half hour mark, heading in Ben Chilwell's cross from deep and England deservedly led at the break.

But Belgium fought back and equalised through Oulare who fired into the corner from 18 yards out after a string of long-range efforts at Freddie Woodman's goal.

Chelsea defender Ola Aina then smashed a long range effort of his own against the crossbar as England went in search of a winner before Barker and Fewster secured the win with the help of Roberts.

First the Fulham forward combined well with Barker to let the latter finish past the keeper, before Fewster wrapped up the win by converting a Roberts cross.

The draw for the elite qualifying round will take place in Nyon on December 3.
