Residents on a housing estate have been left facing a two-mile detour to get home after a council installed a 10-metre bus lane next to a junction.

People living on Wixams estate, outside Bedford, now have to drive along the busy A6 to avoid the 32ft lane that is used by just two buses an hour at peak time.

Nearly 300 drivers been fined since the road was fitted with cameras and marked ‘Bus Only’ two weeks ago.

Up to here: The bus lane cuts off the access to Wixams housing estate in Bedford, leaving residents forced to make a two-mile detour on the A6

The lane has been created in the middle of Kingsway road cutting off the access to the estate.

The restriction, which is controlled by cameras, ends after just ten metres (32ft 9in) and the road continues with an ordinary width.

People living nearby say the lane is nothing more than a money-making scam by Bedford Borough Council which has fined 284 drivers in the past two weeks.

Katie Baughan, 32, was hit with a £50 fine for driving through the bus lane last week.

She said: 'It's nonsense and completely pointless, you can drive either side of this red strip but not through it without getting a ticket.'

Long drive: Almost 300 motorists have been slapped with fines since the 32ft long 'Bus Only' lane was created two weeks ago

Ms Baughan added: ‘There are signs saying 'bus only' directly as you come up to it but not as you are coming off the A6 roundabout.

‘It is completely ridiculous to have such a short bus lane.’

Marie
 Jepps, 68, whose husband David was fined, said: ‘It is ludicrous. I 
think it is just another way to get money out of people.

‘We always go that way to go to the shop or garden centre because it makes sense.’

Well guarded: Several residents on Wixams estate have been given £50 fines after being caught on cameras used to police the short bit of road

There are no time restrictions on the lane which means residents are forced to make their detour around it even when it is not being used at night.

Mark O'Leary, 26, has been a resident on Wixams estate for 2.5 years and says that although the lane has been narrow for the duration of his residency, the cameras have shortened fuses in the area.

'It has always been a bus lane, the only new addition is the actual camera which has gone up in the past few months and the camera sign which has been there for a couple of days.

'I do agree that there are no signs either end of the "shortcut" road highlighting there is no access for vehicles other than buses.'

Tough fines: Bedfordshire Borough Council have been accused of creating the bus lane as a way to 'scam' residents on the housing estate

Despite the protests, Bedford Borough Council defended its decision to introduce the lane.

A spokesman said: ‘We took on the responsibility for the enforcement of bus lanes last April.

'At that time, the council made it clear it would enforce the correct use of bus lanes to ensure the safety of our roads, ease congestion, improve bus punctuality and keep the lanes clear for emergency vehicles.

'All lanes are clearly sign-posted and include clear markings on the road itself.

'There is no excuse for not realising you are driving illegally in a bus lane and it is right that we will take action to keep our roads safe for the majority of road users.’
