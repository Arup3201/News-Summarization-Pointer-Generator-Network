Councillors have slammed a £1.8million planned gypsy site as a 'glorified mod-con holiday camp' - and even a gypsy leader thinks it's too expensive.

The revamp of a 13-pitch site near Bath will include driveways, street lights, soundproofing, landscaping and a permanent building next to each caravan with a kitchen, shower, toilet and living room. Each pitch is expected to cost around £140,000.

But Conservatives and a national gypsy leader alike criticised the cost of the scheme, which could eventually rise to £2.5million, as too much of a burden on taxpayers.

Holiday camp? Officials plan to revamp this traveller site near Bath - but its £1.8m cost has been attacked

Idyll: An artist's impression of how the site could look once work is completed next year. Conservative councillor Tim Warren said: 'It is costing a fortune and I just don't understand why'

Tim
 Warren, opposition group leader on Bath and North East Somerset Council, said: 'When the 
plans first emerged I said it would be cheaper to buy 13 houses with 
drives, now they are building the houses as well as the plots.

'It is costing a fortune and I just don't understand why. I have seen the plans, the buildings are really expensive.

'I think it's like the Hilton, it's just a glorified mod-con holiday camp. I agree that we need to address the travelling problem and make a site for them but this is over the top.'

The council currently has £1.72million set aside for the revamp of the site, which is on the outskirts of the historic city and subject to a planning application.

Officials will also be handed a £750,000 grant for the work by the government's Homes and Communities Agency if they include all the facilties, which are part of the government's standard requirements for new traveller sites.

Each plot must have an amenity building, which will include a 
minimum of hot and cold water, an electricity supply, heating, and space 
for a cooker, fridge-freezer and a washing machine.

The current site. Joseph P Jones, leader of the national Gypsy Council, told MailOnline: '[£140,000 per pitch] sounds quite high - you could build a two-storey house for less than that, let alone a small brick building'

Plan: A view of how the site could look. The facilities must be included to obtain government funds

It
 must also have a separate toilet and sink, a bath or shower room, a 
kitchen or dining area, storage space, and ideally a living room.

The proposed single-storey buildings are designed to be around the same size as a static caravan each and are thought to measure 33ft by 6ft.

The site must also have water and waste drainage, lighting and fencing between the pitches.

The final cost of the site has not been confirmed. Officials on the Liberal Democrat-run council currently say it will be around £1.8million - but some councillors claim that could rise to £2.5million.

Those who live on the site will be charged rent of around £5,800 per pitch per year.

But chairman of the national Gypsy Council Joseph P Jones told MailOnline the cost sounded too high.

He said: 
'A concern that we've had for a long time is the inability of most local
 authorities to deliver projects at a cost-effective price.

'Their contractors seem to charge so much more money than anyone else that I don't even understand where the funding goes.

Tory councillor Tim Warren said: 'I agree that we need to address the problem but this is over the top'

'If it was someone from the community they could probably deliver the whole site for a fraction of that.

'It
 sounds quite high - you could build a two-storey house for less than 
that, let alone a small brick building with some hardstanding to park a 
car.

'Those day rooms might still be just a bit bigger than a normal garage.'

However, he insisted the buildings themselves were necessary.

He said: 'It's quite 
normal for gypsy sites to have a dayroom where people can spend time and
 make sure they can keep themselves clean and tidy and prepare their 
meals.

'It's a government 
recommendation, a pitch should have a dayroom... That's the 21st 
Century, that's what we live in, we don't expect to be living in tents 
any more.

'Gypsies and 
travellers have been forced into the situation they're in today inasmuch
 as they're supposed to live on sites rather than having a travelling 
lifestyle. The least the council can do is make sure the sites are 
decent.

'If the local 
councillors are complaining because these are bigger than what they've 
seen in the past then they should look at where they live.'

A
 report set to go before the council's resources policy development and 
scrutiny panel next week said the site will be developed and managed 
by a unknown 'registered provider', whose job it will be to collect rent from the residents.

Detailed: Full plans for the site, which could be completed by March next year. Mr Jones said: 'Contractors seem to charge so much money, I don't even understand where the funding goes'

But Cllr Warren added the rent charges themselves could put many travellers off.

'Although it is addressing the 
problem the people currently living on the site say they will be leaving
 once it is done because it will be too expensive for them,' he said.

'It will just be shifting the problem else where. It is unbelievable, the money is ridiculous.

'The
 budget for the whole thing would probably equate to, or be in excess of
 every bit of council tax collected in the ward of Twerton, where it is 
going to be based, in a year.'

Bath and North East Somerset Council has a statutory duty to identify a certain number of gypsy and 
traveller sites each year, and said the development work was necessary to stop 
unauthorised traveller sites being set up around the area.

Ben Lownes, a spokesman for the Homes and Communities Agency, said the body had agreed to provide funding for the gypsy site but the details were up to the council.

He said: 'The traveller pitch funding programme which supports these projects is set up to provide new and improved pitches for travellers across England.

'We will have agreed to fund the programme as part of a national programme of activity.

'In terms of detail of what is provided, that is for whoever is bidding to the scheme to decide.'

The HCA provides £60 million for projects to fund gypsy and travelling sites.
