Tee-d off: A highly critical documentary about Donald Trump's £750m golf course in Aberdeenshire, Scotland will air on Sunday for the first time

Residents living near Donald Trump’s £750m golf resort in Aberdeenshire have suffered ‘egotistical bullying,’ film-maker Bill Forsyth claims.

He compares the living conditions of Trump’s neighbours with living in communist-era Romania as a highly critical documentary on the development called You’ve Been Trumped is set to air on UK television for the first time this Sunday.

Forsyth was left ‘dazed and shocked’ after watching the film about proud Scottish homeowners taking on the celebrity tycoon.

The film shows residents’ water and electricity being cut off, tonnes of earth being piled up next to their homes and film-maker Anthony Baxter as complaints by locals to police are ignored.

Forsyth told The Guardian: ‘We’re watching real lives and livelihoods mercilessly put to hazard by a malign concoction of egotistical bullying, corporate muscle flexing, craven averting of gaze by national politicians and crass misreading of events by local authorities including police.’

The documentary, which is acclaimed by radical American film-maker Michael Moore, makes parallels with his Bafta-winning classic film Local Hero in 1983 which tells the story of an American oil tycoon who wants to buy out a remote Scottish village.

Many refer to Local Hero including neighbour Michael Forbes who resisted Trump’s attempts to acquire and demolish his home to expand his golf course.

Trump says on the golf course website: ‘I have never seen such an unspoiled and dramatic sea side landscape and the location makes it perfect for our development.’

But Forsyth described the documentary about the development ‘a moving depiction of human survival and dignity amidst murky doings akin to seventies Romania’.

The film-maker also described Trump as having ‘very limited utility in a sophisticated fictional drama. That’s not to deny his usefulness elsewhere, say in a comparatively primitive or cheap drama’.

On hearing that You’ve Been Trumped 
would be broadcast on British television, the tycoon went on a tirade on
 Twitter, targeting director Baxter and other ‘morons’ for criticising 
the multi-million pound resort.

He
 tweeted to Baxter: @antbaxter should really be ashamed about his 
massive box office disaster. Take a hint and get out of the film 
business, loser. People don’t like false stories.

He also tweeted that the documentary 
has helped him ‘promote & make Trump International Golf Links 
Scotland so successful you stupid fool!’

Trump
 has bought up hundreds of acres on the northeast coast of Scotland and 
built Trump International Golf Links which opened in July.

The
 project, spanning approximately 1235 acres, will also include a second 
18-hole golf course, a 450-room hotel and 1,500 luxury homes in a 
residential village.

The broadcast comes as first minister 
Alex Salmond, once an influential supporter of Trump’s project, was 
refused support from Trump.

Twitter tirade: Trump criticised the documentary's director Anthony Baxter, writing: 'Take a hint and get out of the film business, loser' about his golf course (pictured arriving in Scotland to view developments at the course in June)

It was revealed last week that Trump refused Mr Salmond’s written request to Trump for public support for a controversial decision to release of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, the man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing. 

On Tuesday Trump’s lawyers threatened Scottish agencies supporting a potential offshore wind farm being built near the site of his golf resort.

His executive vice president and counsel, George Sorial, said Baxter’s film was ‘a gross misrepresentation of the facts’ and that the project was widely supported by local residents, businesses and politicians.

He said: 'This film only presents the myopic views of a very small fringe element that are not respected and are widely regarded as a national embarrassment for Scotland.

'Mr. Baxter is not a credible source of information and it's widely known that he breached US copyright laws to produce this film, which is nothing more than a feeble attempt to make money by exploiting the Trump name.

'Despite his yearlong efforts to peddle this fraudulent interpretation of the story, Baxter's film has totally failed at the box office while our course in Aberdeenshire has been embraced by the global golf community and the local residents.'

Not fact: Trump's executive vice president and counsel, George Sorial, said Baxter's film was 'a gross misrepresentation of the facts' and that the project was widely supported by locals

Trump bankrolled a £10million fighting fund for British anti-windfarm campaigners earlier this year.

The move followed proposals for 11 giant turbines off the Aberdeenshire coast, which Mr Trump says will spoil the view from his golfing resort.

The billionaire believes the structures, each as high as a 64-storey building, will besmirch the unspoilt landscape surrounding the £750million, 1,200 acre complex.

But with the resort being built over a site of special scientific interest, Mr Trump's sudden lust for preserving the environment may open him to accusations of hypocrisy.
