A quick-thinking doctor saved the life of his pet tortoise after it nearly drowned - by giving it mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

The eight-year-old reptile, Atlas, appeared to have drowned in his water bowl at Ben Waterfall's home in Swimbridge, Devon.

The horrified family doctor saw the tortoise half submerged in the bowl and picked him up to find he was not breathing.

One shell of a rescue: Ben Waterfall spent six minutes giving Atlas mouth to mouth after the animal fell into his water bowl

Crawling back to life: Eight-year-old Atlas was found half-submerged, with his feet sticking up out of the water bowl

But the determined 34-year-old acted fast, and spent six minutes giving his pet mouth to mouth until the tortoise started breathing again.

Dr Waterfall had been tending his garden when he had walked past Atlas's run and noticed that his pet was in serious trouble.

Touch and go: Dr Waterfall told his two-year-old son Harry that their pet had simply 'gone swimming' in the bowl inside his outdoor run

He said: 'I saw his back feet sticking up out of the water. I pulled him out but he was not breathing and was completely floppy.

'I did six minutes of mouth-to-mouth before he slowly started breathing and blinking.'

The doctor, who works at a GP's surgery in Barnstaple, North Devon, admitted: 'I was quite emotional at the time.

'I first started doing it and I had my mouth over his whole head, mouth, nose and nostrils. Then I changed it to sort of breathing into his nostrils.

'He has a run outdoors which had some water in a concrete container about ten inches long - the same width as his shell. He had just fallen in. He was essentially dead.'

Dr Waterfall's wife Subhani had been putting the couple's two-year-old son Harry to bed when her husband saved the life of their pet.

The doctor told his son that Atlas had 'been swimming' because the boy was too young to understand what was really going on.

The family, who also have a cat, have had Atlas for a year and Dr Waterfall said that to lose him would have been devastating.

He said: 'When my wife came downstairs she said that Atlas is supposed to outlive us. He is not supposed to die young at eight years old.'

Heroic act: The doctor said his colleagues at the GP's surgery thought the episode was 'hilarious'

Tortoises generally have lifespans comparable with those of human beings, and some have lived for more than 150 years.

The pet owner took Atlas to the vet to be checked out and he was given antibiotics in case he had any water in his lungs.

'The guys at work think it is hilarious,' added the doctor. 'There is a mixture of laughter and them kind of saying well done for giving it a go.'
