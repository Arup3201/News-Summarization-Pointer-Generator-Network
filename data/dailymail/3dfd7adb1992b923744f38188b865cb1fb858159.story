Former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis will forever have a presence at Grand Central Terminal in New York City following the opening of an entrance named in her honor on Monday.

The entrance at Park Avenue and East 42nd Street is a tribute to Kennedy’s important role in fighting to save the station in the 1970s when plans were at an advanced stage to build a 53-story tower built atop the iconic structure.

The newly renovated entrance has being named the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Foyer and features a large plaque bronze relief of Onassis and a description of her role in saving the terminal.

Her efforts led to the U.S. Supreme Court upholding the city's Landmark Law in 1978 and saving the station from having its facade and Man Waiting Room destroyed.

The Beaux-Arts train terminal first opened in 1913 and by 1947, over 65 million people - the equivalent of 40 percent of the population of the United States - were traveling through it each year.

Soon after the railroads fell into a major decline with competition from government subsidized highways and intercity airline traffic.

In 1954, a plan was floated - then quickly abandoned - to replace the station with an 80-story structure taller than the Empire State Building.

'Is it not cruel to let our city die by 
degrees, stripped of all her proud monuments, until there will be 
nothing left of all her history and beauty to inspire our children?'- Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, 1975

The New York Central Railroad continued to dramatically decline and in 1968, plans were unveiled for a Marcel Breuer-designed tower to be built over Grand Central.

The terminal had originally been designed to support a tower above it and Breuer’s design would have utilized the existing tower support structure but wouldn’t have preserved the facade or the Main Waiting Room.

The plans drew huge opposition, particularly as the orate Pennsylvania Station had been demolished in 1964 despite pleas to preserve it.

One of the most prominent supporters of the campaign to save Grand Central was Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.

Her efforts included a handwritten letter in 1975 urging then Mayor Abe Beame not to give up in a court battle to defeat the development plan.

‘Is it not cruel to let our city die by degrees, stripped of all her proud monuments, until there will be nothing left of all her history and beauty to inspire our children? If they are not inspired by the past of our city, where will they find the strength to fight for her future?,’ she wrote.

‘Americans care about their past, but for short term gain they ignore it and tear down everything that matters. Maybe… this is the time to take a stand, to reverse the tide, so that we won't all end up in a uniform world of steel and glass boxes.’

Beame announced that the city would fight to save Grand Central and six months prior to the unveiling of the
 Breuer plans, the New York City Landmarks Preservation 
Commission designated the station a 'landmark.'

In 1978, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the city Landmarks Law, which had been challenged by developers.

The landmark case was the first time that the Supreme Court ruled on a matter of historic preservation.

'Mrs. Onassis is one of America's most cherished historical figures and she is considered by many a renowned savior of Grand Central,' Metro-North Railroad President Joseph Giulietti said.

'This landmark building, universally acclaimed as one of the world's great public spaces, is still here today because of her leadership.'
