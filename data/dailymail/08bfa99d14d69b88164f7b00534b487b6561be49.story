Celebrations were cut short for one Missouri woman on July 4 when she was shot in the face by a stray bullet.

Someone had fired a shot in the air in High Ridge as Jan Brewer was enjoying the fireworks display.

Suddenly, she was struck in the face by what felt like 'a baseball bat type thing,' she said.

Stray bullet: Jan Brewer was injured when a bullet hit her in the face and lodged in her cheek

Irresponsible: It narrowly missed her eye and Brewer and her husband think it must have been shot by a reveler from far away, because no one close-by was shooting

Brewer told KMOV that she thought she must have been struck by fireworks.

It wasn't until she went to a local hospital for X-rays that she found out she had a bullet lodged in her cheek.

Brewer and her husband believe someone far away must have fired off a celebratory shot.

No one in their area was shooting a gun, they say, and Jefferson County sheriff's deputies have not yet identified the shooter.

Surprise: Brewer thought she was injured by a firework until an x-ray revealed the bullet

'I have nothing against people owning guns. That’s their right,' Brewer told KMOV.

'It’s the responsibility they should take when they own a gun. That’s my biggest concern. Once you own a gun, you should take responsibility to do the right thing.'

Brewer's injuries could have been far worse.

'One inch up and it would have taken my eye out. One inch lower it would have hit my throat. But it hit the bone and lodged in the side of my face,' she said.

'I'm just grateful to be here.'
