A couple of farmers have built the world's first bed and breakfast out of a 1960s milk float after renovating the inside of the vehicle to create a mobile hotel.

Emma Collinson and her partner Stuart Billinghurst have transformed the 50-year-old into a £95-a-night love shack complete with a double bed, shower, toilet and lounge area.

The couple hope to welcome guests to float which is kept on their alpaca farm in Bodmin Moor, Cornwall, by next Easter.

The couple have spent over £1,000 building the world's first b&b built out of a milk float after buying this 1960s vehicle from a milkman

After purchasing the vehicle for just £500 from a milkman in Bath, the couple spent over £1,000 remodelling its interior to even include a cooking area and sink among other mod-cons.

The couple, who offer courses in husbandry at the farm, even appeared on Channel 4 to show off their efforts.

Ms Collinson, who ran a gym in Plymouth before turning her hand to design said: 'We only have our static park home here on the farm so it would be 
impossible for people to stay.

'But when the courses are on for more than one
 day it is often good for those doing them to spend longer on the farm 
so they get the feel for it. 

'Stuart used to own a milk float and even went to work in one.

The couple paid £500 for the vehicle when they bought it from a milkman in Bath before beginning renovations

With the help of committed friends, the couple were able to complete work on the float over five weekends

A lounge in the cab area is one of the b&b's more luxurious features. The couple spent £1,051 working on the float

'This gave us the idea, so we tried to get hold of that one but we weren't able to so we got this one instead. 

'We managed to do all the work over just five weekends, it was a really crazy time but we had lots of friends who pitched in. 

'I fought with Stuart to have a loo and he wanted a shower so we worked out a way to attach both to the back. 

'There is a sink under the bed which folds up. In the cab there are seats and the steering wheel is still there and all the buttons. 

'That is my favourite bit - being able to sit in the cab with a cup of tea.

The couple run husbandry courses on their alpaca farm in Cornwall and wanted to provide guests somewhere comfortable to stay

A double bed which can be flipped upwards conceals a small cooking area and sink in the float which costs up to £95-a-night to rent

Mr Billinghurst used to work in a milk float himself and had aspirations of owning one when the couple decided to purchase theirs for £500

The couple are thrilled to have built the world's first b&b from a milk float. Ms Collinson's favourite feature of the vehicle is the cab where 'you can have a cup of tea' (right)

'In total it has cost us £1,051.09 to refit it and it will be only be available during the summer months. 

'It is kind of like glamping as the sides around the bed is a canopy which can be rolled down. 

'We will provide the breakfast which will be produce from the farm as much as possible. 

'It is just something really different, I never imagined I would be doing this. I'm quite proud that we own the world's first, and only milk float B&B. 

'It will stay in the field where the alpacas are as it doesn't have a motor and hopefully make people feel like they are away from it all.'

To stay in Luna the milk float from Sunday-Thursday it costs £75-per-a-night, while weekend nights will set you back £95.
