Prince William described her as 'an extremely talented British actress who I should probably call granny' following her film portrayal of Her Majesty.

Now, it appears Dame Helen Mirren has had words with the real Queen about the moment the Duke of Cambridge presented her with an honorary fellowship award at the BAFTAs last night.

The elegant actress, who could be seen wagging her finger at the head of state, was among around 250 stars to be introduced to members of the royal family personally at a glittering Buckingham Palace this evening.

Speaking about being introduced to Her Majesty, she said: 'You're thinking "its the Queen it's the Queen"' - and when asked if she still got starstruck, she replied: 'Of course, even more so I think because I feel self conscious, you know.'

Having words: Dame Helen Mirren (pictured with Sir David Attenborough, third left) appears to be having words with the Queen about the moment Prince William presented her with a BAFTA fellowship award. She can be seen wagging her finger at the head of state at a glittering reception at Buckingham Palace this evening

Meeting Kate: On Sunday night, Prince William described Dame Helen as 'an extremely talented British actress who I should probably call granny'

Laughing: Dame Helen told a giggling Kate 'Your husband called me granny last night' - to which she replied: 'I know'. Above, the pair share a joke as Sir David looks on

Overwhelmed: Speaking about being introduced to Her Majesty, Dame Helen (pictured above with Kate and Sir David) said: 'You're thinking "its the Queen it's the Queen"'

She added: 'I am genuinely always astounded by her aura, her twinkle, her presence. It never fails to surprise me and again it's what everyone says when they meet her - it was what overwhelmed me the first time I met her.'

Dame Helen then met the Duchess of Cambridge, whom she told: 'Your husband called me granny last night' - to which a giggling Kate replied: 'I know' and revealed he had asked her whether she thought the joke 'appropriate'.

As Dame Helen and other members of film royalty met members of the
 real royal family, Kate ensured she stood out at the star-studded Dramatic Arts Reception in a vibrant 
red Alexander McQueen dress.

The Duchess of Cambridge 32, has worn the designer pleated skirt dress on previous occasions, most famously on the royal barge 
during the Diamond Jubilee river pageant of 2012.

Re-worked look: Kate accessorised her red dress from Alexander McQueen's spring/summer 2011 collection with a black clutch and heels

Glamorous: She also ditched the hat to let her glossy brown locks fall around her shoulders and wore long gold earrings

Applause: The Queen, the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Michael of Kent watch the performance at Buckingham Palace

On that day she accessorised with her
 trusty LK 
Bennett nude heels and a Lock & Co hat. For today's event, hosted by
 the Queen to celebrate the dramatic arts, she went for a less formal 
look.

She ditched the hat to let her glossy
 brown locks fall around her shoulders and substituted a patriotic 
tartan clutch she carried for the Jubliee event for a plainer black 
purse and matching black heels. She added an additional new touch to her look with long, gold earrings.

The red dress has 
been worn by a number of celebrities since it made its debut on the 
spring/summer 
2011 catwalk back in February 2010.

The former X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos wore a sleeveless version of it for the reality show's auditions in July 2011. She
 wore the piece, with its flattering pleated skirt and neat peplum, with
 minimal accessories - just black stilettos and a slick of red lipstick 
finished off the look for Tulisa.

 TV queen Kim Kardashian has also been pictured in the dress when out in
 New York, adding some bling with a jeweled necklace and metallic 
clutch.

But thankfully none of the
 Hollywood stars and the giants of British film and theatre who joined 
the Duchess of Cambridge at Buckingham Palace this evening made the 
fashion faux pas of wearing the same outfit as style queen Kate.

Actresses
 Uma Thurman, Joely Richardson, Joan Collins, Gemma Arterton and Dame 
Angela Lansbury were all present at the glittering Buckingham Palace 
reception, as well as Sir Roger Moore, Alan Rickman and Ralph Fiennes.

The
 Duchess was introduced to many of the 250 stars present on a night
 celebrating the Queen's 60 years as patron of the Royal Academy of 
Dramatic Art and the wider contribution that the dramatic arts make to 
national life. 

Performance: Dame Helen Mirren came on for the finale, reciting Prospero's Our Revels Now Are Ended speech from Shakespeare's The Tempest

Acting: The performance included the famous line: 'We are such stuff as dreams are made on'

Dramatic: Rada students on stage performing songs from Oh! What A Lovely War before an audience, including the Queen and Duchess of Cambridge

Inside 
the White Drawing Room, the Queen greeted a line-up of ten hand-picked 
celebrities, including Alan Rickman, Sir David Attenborough - 
representing his brother Richard, Lord Attenborough who was too ill to 
attend - Miss Marple star Dame Angela Lansbury, actress Jane Horrocks, 
British film director of 12 Years A Slave Steve McQueen.

Also present was comedian Lenny Henry, who made a joke about Helen Mirren's film performance as the Queen.

Pointing to the 87-year-old monarch and joking with McQueen, he said: 'This is Helen Mirren. She's brilliant.'

Actress Jane Horrocks asked the Queen 
about the honorary BAFTA she was given in April last year and the 
monarch replied that she saw it all the time. 'I keep it on the TV,' she
 said.

Afterwards Kate accompanied the Queen, 
who was wearing a sapphire and diamond brooch that Prince Albert gave to
 Queen Victoria on her wedding day, into the palace Ballroom to meet the
 rest of her guests.

The highlight of the evening was a short performance including a medley of songs from Oh What A Lovely War, Joan Littlewood's satirical anti-war 1963 musical which was turned into a 1969 film by Lord Attenborough, performed by RADA students.

The Queen, Kate and Prince Michael of
 Kent sat entranced in the front row in the palace ballroom as the 
students went through their paces after being introduced by Hugh Laurie.

Trevor
 Eve, One Foot In The Grave star Richard Willson, and Jessie Buckley, 
the Irish singer, then performed a scene from George Bernard Shaw's 
Pygmalion before young singer Cynthia Erivo belted out a song from The 
Color Purple and Sir Tom Courtenay recited some lines from The Dresser.

Dame
 Helen Mirren came on for the finale, reciting Prospero's Our Revels Now
 Are Ended speech from Shakespeare's The Tempest, including the famous 
line: ‘We are such stuff as dreams are made on.’

Some of the biggest Hollywood stars said they felt humbled by going to the palace.

McQueen dress has previously been worn in sleeveless form by Kim

Fashion fashback: Kate paired the dress with her favourite LK Bennett nude heels and a tartan clutch when she joined Prince William for the Jubliee celebrations in 2012

‘It's
 such a privilege, such an honour. I am chuffed and overwhelmed,’ said 
Uma Thurman. ‘It's so beautiful. I had to remind myself not to trip 
because you can be taken in by the beauty of the place.’

‘I
 had never met the Queen before and now I have. Iyt was a wonderful 
performance,’ she added. ‘Us Americans, you know. We are all in awe of 
British actors.’

The 
invitation to the palace was also the icing on the cake for Bond girl 
Gemma Arterton. ‘My Mum and Dad were so proud when I got the letter. 
They said 'you're going to meet the Queen.’

‘I've most of the Royal Family but I'd never met the Queen. Now I've got the full set.’
