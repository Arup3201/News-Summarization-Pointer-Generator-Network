Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's White House buzz got a boost Wednesday with word that donors and Clinton partisans would meet Friday for a New York City planning confab.

But hours later Jim Webb, a former one-term Virginia senator, sucked all the oxygen out of her news cycle with word that he had launched a presidential exploratory committee.

Only months ago the 2016 Democratic presidential campaign season was seen as a formality, a drawn-out Clinton coronation. But now there's another voice in the conversation, and it may appeal to right-leaning Democrats: Webb was once Secretary of the Navy during Ronald Reagan's presidency.

He also has solid national security bona fides that can match with Clinton's tenure as America's top diplomat, and a military service record that she can't equal.

But Webb is seen as less stridently liberal than Clinton, which could give her a rhetorical foil when she argues her case to the Democratic Party's left wing.

That was the party constituency that abandoned her in 2008, siding with a little-known Illinois senator named Barack Obama.

HILLARY KILLER? Webb is a right-leaning Democrat with strong national security bona fides and a military service record to match

Not happening again: Bill Clinton campaigned with Webb for a Virginia Senate seat in 2006, but the former president will have other priorities in 2016

Clinton isn't officially a candidate for 2016 but a super PAC bearing her name – 'Ready For Hillary' – is gathering hundreds of donors in New York to meet with the people who could become her political war council.

Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack will speak to the group in a panel discussions entitled, 'Why I'm ready for Hillary,' according to The Hill newspaper.

Only donors who have kicked in at least $5,000 to the pro-Clinton committee have been invited. CLinton herself will not attend.

Other speakers on the lineup include Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee executive director Guy Cecil and EMILY’s List president Stephanie Schriock, whose group grooms and backs candidates who favor abortion rights.

Strategists James Carville, Paul Begala and Harold Ickes will attend – all old names from President Bill Clinton's orbit.

'If she's ready to start the engine, so are we,' one event organizer told The Hill.

Webb announced his exploratory committee's formation in a message posted from his Twitter account late Wednesday, making him the first candidate of either of the two major political parties to take an official step toward running for the White House.

'A strong majority of Americans agree that we are at a serious crossroads,' Webb wrote in a message posted to a website for his committee along with a 14-minute video address.

'In my view, the solutions are not simply political, but those of leadership. I learned long ago on the battlefields of Vietnam that in a crisis, there is no substitute for clear-eyed leadership.'

The former Virginia senator has hinted at a possible presidential campaign for months and made campaign appearances this fall with Democrats in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire.

But any Democratic presidential primary candidate not named Hillary Clinton is considered a long shot at this stage.

Webb's surprise announcement, released shortly before midnight, sets off the possibility of a challenge, at least.

The field could also include Vice President Joe Biden, Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who is considering running in the Democratic primary.

Other names floated to MailOnline by pollsters and fundraisers in background conversations include New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner and California Gov. Jerry Brown.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton had all the Democratic Party's presidential momentum a few months ago but now must share the spotlight with other White House hopefuls on the political left

Steve McMahon, a Democratic strategist and veteran of presidential campaigns, told the Associated Press that Webb can offer bipartisan appeal to an electorate soured by gridlock in Washington.

'Whether he can overcome Hillary Clinton's enormous, overwhelming advantage is something that only time will tell,' he said.

Webb's decision to form an exploratory committee increases the likelihood that Clinton could position herself ideologically between two other candidates in order to paint each of them as an extremist. 

'With O'Malley on the left and Webb on her right, Secretary Clinton may have a perfect opportunity to triangulate,' McMahon said.

The message from Webb included appeals to Democrats who have struggled during the economic recovery and criticized political leaders for being too close to Wall Street. The former senator also makes the case for a shift in foreign policy that cautions against overseas entanglements.

Webb said the nation faces major obstacles in governing and pointed to domestic and foreign policy items that need to be atop the agenda.

'We need to put our American house in order, to provide educational and working opportunities that meet the needs of the future.' He noted the stock market has nearly tripled during 'this so-called "recovery"' while income levels and loans to small business owners have decreased.

He said the U.S. needs to 'redefine and strengthen our national security obligations, while at the same time reducing ill-considered foreign ventures.'

Webb acknowledged he would face considerable challenges in a presidential bid, saying 'early support will be crucial as I evaluate whether we might overcome what many commentators see as nearly impossible odds.' The committee will allow Webb to raise money and travel the nation to test the waters for a potential campaign.

The 68-year-old Vietnam War veteran served as Navy secretary under President Ronald Reagan. He defeated Republican Sen. George Allen in his 2006 Senate campaign, serving one term. In the message, he said he entered the race against Allen only nine months before the election and trailed by 30 percentage points before prevailing.

Webb cast himself as an outsider, saying, 'In politics, nobody owns me, and I don't owe anybody anything, except for the promise that I will work for the well-being of all Americans, especially those who otherwise would have no voice in the corridors of power.'

'All I ask is that you consider the record I am putting before you, and give me the opportunity to earn your trust,' he said.
