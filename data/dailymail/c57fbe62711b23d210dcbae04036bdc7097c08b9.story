After the incident Hackett made a public apology to his ex-wife Candice Alley and thanked Crown hotel for their 'professionalism and poise.' 

'I was focused solely on finding Jagger and nothing else,' he said. 

'Every parent's worst fear is losing one of their children. 

'Unfortunately, my adventurous son decided to go wandering in the early hours.' 

Hackett admitted he was 'embarrassed' and noted his plans on purchasing 'a smaller apartment with a deadlock.' 

After his marriage ended in 2012, Hacket admitted to a 'heavy reliance' on Stilnox, a controversial sleeping pill.

In 2011, the athlete was dropped as an ambassador for the Alannah and Madeline Foundation, a charity that aims to keep children safe from violence, after he trashed his penthouse in a drunken rage on Derby Day. 

Sunday Herald Sun released photos of the penthouse with walls punched, a flipped grand piano and smashed furniture.
