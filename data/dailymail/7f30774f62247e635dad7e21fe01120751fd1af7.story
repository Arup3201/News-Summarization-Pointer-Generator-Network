Nancy Reagan appeared to be recovering well as she recently endorsed Mitt Romney after she broke her ribs from a fall weeks ago.

The former first lady served the presumptive Republican nominee lemonade and cookies at her Los Angeles home on Thursday where she announced her support of the candidate.

Mrs Reagan, who is 90 years old, walked with help from a cane as she greeted Romney and his wife, Ann, about seven weeks after she suffered injuries from a fall at her house.

Despite her injuries, Mrs Reagan invited the Romneys over for a visit as they campaigned on the West Coast for the week.

Ronald Reagan's wife wore a white skirt with a matching white blazer for the meeting.

As for today's politics, President Reagan's widow said she is firmly behind Romney.

She said that her 'Ronnie' would have liked Romney's business background and what she calls his 'strong principles.'

In
a statement issued after the Romneys' visit, Mrs. Reagan said she 
believes that Romney has the experience and leadership skills that, in 
her words, 'our country so desperately needs.'

Concern: Health is a central role in the later years of Mrs Reagan's life after several falls (pictured here in 2011)

Health issues: Mrs Reagan, pictured here with President George W Bush in 2004, was sent to the hospital twice in 2008, including breaking her pelvis from the accidents at her home

She held onto the cane as she posed 
for pictures with the unofficial nominee who got the 1,144 delegates 
necessary to run against President Barack Obama in November.

Health
has played a central role in the later years of Mrs Reagan's life after
she spent most of the 1980s in the White House as First Lady.

The Reagan Presidential Library in Simi 
Valley, California, where she was expected to attend a speech by House Budget 
Committee Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin last week, said she would not be present at the event because of her fall.

Her injury prevented her from 
attending and she watched the event on her television at home, Library 
executive director John Heubusch said.

Early years: Mrs Reagan shares a playful moment with her husband, President Ronald Reagan, who died in 2004 from a long battle with Alzheimer's disease

Her spokeswoman Joanne Drake said Mrs Reagan has been adding a few appointments to her schedule but was 
advised by her doctor not to attend large events.

In 2008, Mrs Reagan broke her pelvis in a fall at her home.

X-rays revealed that she had suffered a fractured pelvis and sacrum - the large triangular bone at the base of the spine.

Mrs
Reagan was hospitalised for three days earlier that year after a 
similar fall at the hillside home she shared with her husband after 
their White House years.

President Reagan died in 2004 after a long battle with Alzheimer's disease.

'I won't do it': Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush told reporters he will not be Mitt Romney's running mate

Jeb Bush, former Florida governor, announced today that he will not be chosen to be Mitt Romney's running mate.

The brother of President George W Bush insisted that Romney will not look in his direction to become the Republican candidate for vice president during a visit on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC.

'He won't ask and I won't do it,' he said.

He went on to say: 'Itâ€™s not in the cards for me.'

Instead, Bush offered his personal choice for the position to run alongside Romney: Florida Senator Marco Rubio.

'That would be my choice,' Bush said.
