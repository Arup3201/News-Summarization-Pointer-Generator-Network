A divorced couple who stole almost £500,000 from their severely brain-damaged daughter's £2.6million compensation fund have been jailed.

A judge said Cathy Watson, 44, betrayed the trust between a mother and a daughter 'in the most appalling and distressing way' as she sentenced her to five-and-a-half years in prison.

Watson's ex-husband, Robert Hills, 50, was jailed for three years and four months after Judge Jacqueline Davies outlined how the pair spent huge amounts of cash on top-of-the-range cars, jewellery and even cosmetic surgery.

Doncaster Crown Court heard how the couple bought more than a dozen cars, including luxury BMWs and Mercedes.

Watson bought a Mini Cooper which she had completely resprayed and reupholstered in pink and finished with a personalised number plate.

Judge Davies recalled how the pair spent thousands of pounds on jewellery and 250 Royal Doulton ornaments.

'We just spent and spent and spent,' Hills told police.

Hills, 50, admitted four counts of theft from the fund which was supposed to provide for Samantha Svendsen, now 29, whom he adopted when he married Watson.

Watson, 44, was found guilty of three counts of theft and one of converting criminal property following a trial last year.

The compensation was awarded to their daughter Miss Svendsen, who suffers from cerebral palsy and needs round-the-clock care after suffering brain damage due to medical negligence at her birth.

Jailing the pair, Judge Davies said: 'The way the money was spent was nothing short of greed and indulgence.'

Turning to Watson, the judge said: 'One can only begin to understand the difficult time you had giving birth to a severely disabled child at the age of 14.

'But you, as her mother, were the person closest to her - the person she looked to trust. You have betrayed that trust in the most appalling and distressing way.'

Hills, of Grimsby, and Watson, of Scunthorpe, stood in the glass-fronted dock as they were sentenced, separated by a security officer.

Neither showed any emotion as they were led away.

Judge Davies said: 'There are many parents who have to look after disabled children.

'The majority do so without the sums of money that were awarded to your daughter to help with her care. They do so out of love.'

The judge explained how Miss Svendsen has limited speech and has little body movement. She can move one of her hands, which she uses to operate her wheelchair.

Judge Davies said the initial medical negligence pay-out included a direct payment to Watson of £270,000 for expenses she had already incurred.

It also provided for a £4,000-a-month income for the family on top of benefits they were entitled to.

The rest of the money, the judge said, was supposed to be invested to provide a secure income for Miss Svendsen for the rest of her life.

The judge said all these payments, plus rental income from a property portfolio, meant the family had a large legitimate income 'but it was not enough to fund the extravagant lifestyle that you both clearly enjoyed for a substantial period of time'.

She said that for about five years the couple, who divorced in 2004 after a 14 year long marriage, were spending about £117,000 a year.

Among the spending highlighted by the judge was £12,000 on Watson's cosmetic surgery and how she bought a business called Cathy's Wedding Bliss which 'failed miserably'.

She said they had also bought 15 or 16 luxury cars.

The judge said that partly as a result of her parents' actions, Miss Svendsen's fund was now extremely depleted and only £150,000 remained.

Judge Davies explained that because Miss Svendsen was no longer being looked after by her parents, professionals were now caring for her at a cost of almost £100,000 a year.

'There are many parents who have to look after disabled children. The majority do so without the sums of money that were awarded to your daughter to help with her care. They do so out of love'

She said the fund will probably be exhausted in two years and the State will then have to pick up the bill.

'I do not know what the consequence will be to her (Miss Svendsen),' the judge said.

'She is well aware of what you have done and the emotional impact on her cannot be ignored.'

Judge Davies said that after the compensation award the couple legitimately bought a huge house in the Cleethorpes area for £117,000 and spent up to £600,000 renovating it and adapting it for their daughter.

But, the judge said, it was now only worth £425,000 because most potential buyers have no need for the adaptations.

The judge explained how much of the money stolen by grandmother Watson and Hills was secured from the Court of Protection - the body that administers the compensation payment - in order to invest in property for their daughter.

But, she said, the pair sold the houses and pocketed the cash.

They even made a down-payment on a property in Florida and then spent the £90,000 when the deal was cancelled.

Judge Davies said the total amount of money stolen by the pair from their daughter was just over £450,000.

She was particularly scathing of £31,000 in cash Watson took out of a bank account when she realised the police were on to her and 'you knew the game was up'.

Judge Davies ordered the six month sentence she imposed for this be served in addition to the five years for all the thefts.
