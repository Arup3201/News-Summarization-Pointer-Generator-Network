Three members of the same family have been hauled before a judge in New Jersey, two of whom have pleaded guilty to murder.

Father and daughter, Thomas and Kathleen Dorsett  plead guilty to murdering her ex-husband, Stepehen Moore in New Jersey.

Meanwhile, Kathleen's mother and Thomas's wife, Lesley Dorsett, also became involved in a despicable plot to murder her daughter's mother-in-law.

Family of felons: Kathleen Dorsett, 38, and her parents, Lesley, 68, and Thomas Dorsett, 66, all of Ocean Township, appeared this morning before a judge in New Jersey

Kathleen Dorsett, 38, a former third-grade teacher, plead guilty to murdering her former husband in Ocean Township.

The family told the judge they were angry about 
the divorce decree and custody arrangements for the couple's daughter, 
who was then 20 months old.

She
told a judge today she sent 42-year-old Stephen Moore to his death in 
the backyard, where her father was waiting to kill him, in 2010.

Dorsett says she was changing her daughter's diaper when she heard Stephen scream in agony. But she didn't run outside to help him but instead kept changing their daughter's diaper 
knowing that her father was carrying out their plan to kill the man by 
hitting him in the head with a heavy cable.

She then went outside to help her father put her husbands body in the trunk of a car.

Her father, Thomas, 66, entered a guilty plea right after her.

He says he started an argument with his former son-in-law, then struck him in the head with a cable.

He was beaten to death. The callous duo then stuffed the body into the trunk of a car and set it ablaze.

The father, Thomas Dorsett admitted he drove the car with Moore's body to Long Branch and then hired someone to set it on fire the following day.

In Thursday's court hearing, lawyers and the defendants revealed how frustrating family problems turned into a murder plot.

A few years after they married, prosecutors said Kathleen began telling her father there were problems in the marriage and that she did not think Moore could provide for the family.

Thomas Dorsett said he provided for his daughter's family while she was married and that he helped take care of his granddaughter, who lived two houses away.

'That's all I did,' he told the court.

Thomas Dorsett and Moore's relationship grew increasingly hostile. He acknowledged in Thursday's hearing that he had considered planting drugs on Moore or killing him earlier.

Under the couple's divorce agreement, Thomas Dorsett was ordered to support Moore financially, including helping him find a place to live and that added to the strained relationship.

Dorsett pleaded guilty to first-degree murder, attempted murder and second-degree conspiracy to desecrate human remains. Her father, Thomas, pleaded guilty to murder and arson-for-hire.

The teacher's mother, Lesley Dorsett, 68,  also appeared in court alongside the other family member.

She has been charged with conspiracy and is accused of plotting whilst behind bars along with her daughter to have her former mother-in-law killed.

Hitman: Anthony Morris was paid $1,000 as a down-payment in the plot to kill Kathleen Dorsett's mother-in-law but police got wind of the deal before the murder could take place

Prosecutors say in that part of the case, they tried to hire a hit-man to kill Stephen Moore’s mother.

'The goal was to kill (her) because we were afraid she was going to testify,' Lesley Dorsett said.

The women were also upset Moore's mother was awarded temporary custody of Kathleen Dorsett's daughter.

Lesley Dorsett said she took an envelope
with Moore's mother's name on it, stuffed it with cash and handed it 
over at a department store to someone she believed was a hit man. However, 
the supposed hit man was actually an undercover cop and Lesley Dorsett 
was soon arrested.

Police stopped the plot and Moore’s mother was not harmed.

The plot was uncovered whilst Kathleen Dorsett was already in jail. She told a former inmate, Alice Anderson, 51, that she and her father made mistakes when they killed Stephen. She said that she needed someone to kill his mother.

She asked for Anderson’s help. Anderson said she contacted her domestic partner, who instead of setting them up with a hitman, contacted police.

She then agreed to wear a wire and capture evidence in order to bring charges and stop the plot.

Lesley Dorsett was charged with paying the fake hitman $1,000 as a down payment.

The family were all jailed on a $1.5 million bond.

Kathleen Dorsett has explained her reasons for the initial killing. She has said wanted to move with her daughter to Florida but wasn't planning on bringing her ex-husband with - so she decided to get rid of him.

Kathleen Dorsett faces 58 years in state prison, with no parole before 51 years. Thomas Dorsett faces 50 years in prison with no parole before 30 years. Lesley Dorsett faces eight years in prison with no parole before seven years. All three are scheduled to be sentenced Aug. 8.
