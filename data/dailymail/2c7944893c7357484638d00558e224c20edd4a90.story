Barcelona star Lionel Messi has been enjoying his downtime by celebrating the birthday of his long-time girlfriend Antonella Roccuzzo. 

The 27-year-old forward took to Instagram to upload a family selfie, featuring the couple and their son Thiago.

And it was all smiles in the Messi household from the three of them on Thursday, as he captioned the snap: 'Feliz cumple mi vida', or 'Happy birthday my life'.

Lionel Messi saw his last-minute penalty saved as Barcelona beat Manchester City 2-1 on Tuesday 

Messi was in action as recently as Tuesday night, when his Barcelona side beat Manchester City 2-1 at the Etihad Stadium in the first leg of their last-16 Champions League tie.

Despite an excellent performance as strike partner Luis Suarez scored both goals for Barcelona, it was ultimately a night to forget for Messi as he saw his last-minute penalty saved by Joe Hart.

And he is set to be in action again on Saturday, as Barcelona head to Granada in hope of securing the three points that will help close the gap on La Liga leaders Real Madrid.
