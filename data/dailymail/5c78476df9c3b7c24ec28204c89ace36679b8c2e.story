Walkers seeking the perfect place to enjoy a reflective moment need look no further.

These gorgeous landscapes show off Britain's best beauty spots in twice their usual glory.

Each magnificent panoramic vista has been photographed so its splendour is mirrored in a still lake beneath.

Misty mountains: A panoramic view of a shimmering Loch Leven in Glencoe village near Fort William, Highland region of Scotland

Pure beauty: A lone building throws atmospheric shadows over a breathtaking vista at the wild Loch Leven

Caught in time: Black Mount Hills covered in brilliant white snow on a sunny winter's day and mirrored in a frozen Lochain

The images - taken by photographer Lee Frost over ten years - reveal breathtaking double visions of mountainous peaks, lush valleys and shimmering water.

One atmospheric picture shows mist rolling in over Loch Leven near Glencoe village in the wild Scottish Highlands.

Another shows the plunging V-shape of Loch Achtriochtan and its mirror image as it plummets towards the lake.

The imposing Black Mountains are seen still 
capped in snow on a sunny winter's day and reflected in the glittering frozen Lochain below.

Awe-inspiring view: Loch Ba' rises up in the distance behind the rolling clouds over Rannoch Moor

The grand slope of Lochan na h-Achlaise glows in a soft light above the craggy Rannoch Moor, while a more gentle scene captures the blues of an early morning in Grasmere near Ambleside at Cumbria's Lake District.

Once home to many of the Lakeland poets, the area has a rich history that is still honoured today by captivated artists, writers and craftspeople.

So if you're not taking an overseas holiday this summer, don't despair. This dramatic scenery proves that our native surroundings can be just as impressive as the finest in the world.

Mr Frost, 45, from Barnsley in South Yorkshire, has been travelling around the country since 2000 to take the pictures.

'I love the north but the Highlands of
 Scotland represent the last wilderness in the UK,' he said. 'There’s 
nowhere else left where you can literally disappear in the landscape and
 see hardly a soul for days.

'The scale of the landscape is also awe-inspiring, while wild weather brings out the drama and character of the scenery.

'I’ve
 explored and photographed the Highlands in all seasons and it remains a
 constant source of inspiration – nature in its raw state.'

Incredibly, many of the pictures were taken using the pre-digital technique of physical transparencies.

Stunning scene: Loch Eil, in the Scottish Highlands glistens as the sun lights the waters

This means light passing through the camera lens struck chemicals contained in the film, leaving a transparent print.

These transparencies were then digitally scanned so they could be stored and distributed electronically.

'Shooting transparency film definitely makes you more focused,' added Mr Frost. 'There’s little room for error and what you shoot in-camera is what you end up with.

'With digital you have the benefit of post-production.'
