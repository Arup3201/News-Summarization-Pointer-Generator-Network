It's unlikely you'll hear a little girl utter the words, 'when I grow up, I want to be a funeral director.'

But Poppy Mardall, 29, who has herself embarked on the morbid career, thinks more women should break into the male dominated profession.

'Women are in the minority in this industry. While women often care for the dying as nurses, there's a perception that when you die it's then the 'men in black' who should come in and sort everything out,' she told the MailOnline.

Career change: Poppy Mardall gave up a job at Sotheby's to set up her own funeral service

'There's a perception that men are better at coping with death because they can shut down their emotions. But it's also important to be in touch with feelings and to be caring - both for helping take care of someone's body and helping their bereaved family.'

Poppy, from Fulham, South West London, gave up a career as deputy director and expert at Sotheby's to set up her own business, Poppy's Funerals, last June. Her change in career was influenced by her work volunteering at the Samaritans and Trinity Hospice.

She explains: 'I wanted to do a job that was more important, where I could help people. The way we have dealt with death and dying hasn't changed for centuries. I want to give people more choice and support.'

No 'men in black': Poppy takes a more feminine approach with no black hearses or black coffins

She added that she has 'no fascination with death' as her work is really about 'helping the living' by supporting grieving families.

Nevertheless, of course she does also have to work with death bodies in the mortuary on a regular basis and prepare them for cremation. So how does she cope with this aspect of the job?

'Before I did the job I had never seen a dead body and, like most people, thought of it as something scary. But I quickly got used to it. It's not scary, it's the person who you love whose heart has stopped beating,' she said.

'The job has made me hold the people I love tighter and appreciate them more'

Dealing with grieving families daily must also be harrowing but Poppy said she finds the work 'sad but fulfilling'.

She added: 'With this job I get a tangible sense of helping people. It's meaningful, wonderful work.'

If she ever has a particularly difficult day, she said she unwinds by talking about it to husband Chris, 29, and going for walks. She added that her work has changed her own outlook on life.

'It has made me hold the people I love tighter. It has made me appreciate them more and not to dwell on small things, hold grudges or let arguments lie unresolved.'

Rewarding work: The funeral director said she no longer finds dead bodies 'scary'

Poppy said is putting feminine touches into her business by doing away with black hearses and black coffins. Instead, her vehicles are white and covered in poppies and they use coffins made from willow and bamboo.

She believes her approach is more personal and meaningful, doing away with the pomp for a simpler and modern cremation where the families of the bereaved can call the shots.

As many people don't like to think about death, Poppy said when she reveals her profession it can often be a conversation-stopper at parties. She spoke to the MailOnline to mark the release of a new film released this Friday, Bernie, starring Jack Black, that is set in a funeral home. She hopes such films can get people talking more openly about death.

'It is something we all have to face eventually,' she said. 'It is important to think about what you want to happen to yourself and the people you love when they die.'
