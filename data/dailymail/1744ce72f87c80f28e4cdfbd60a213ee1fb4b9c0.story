Hero: Douglas Bader hoists one of his artificial legs into the cockpit before another flight

It was a disaster that changed his life and might have crushed the spirit of a lesser man.

When Douglas Bader crashed his plane while performing aerobatic stunts, he suffered horrendous injuries that cost him his legs.

But despite the devastating impact it would have on his flying and his passion for rugby and boxing, there was not a trace of self-pity in the entry Bader made in his logbook for the events of that fateful day near Reading on December 14, 1931.

With stoic understatement the 21-year-old pilot simply wrote: ‘X country – Reading. Crashed slow-rolling near ground. Bad show.’

Bader
never let the consequences of his ‘bad show’ get the better of him and 
went on to become a Second World War flying hero despite his artificial 
legs.

The log containing his assessment of the crash is being put up for auction for the first time and is expected to fetch £30,000.

It
also reveals how he struggled to learn to fly after joining the RAF in 
1928 and was rebuked by his instructor for his ‘poor performance’ in 
taking too long on solo practice flights.

Original
transcripts detailing an extraordinary operation by the RAF and the 
Germans to supply Bader with a new wooden leg after he was taken 
prisoner in 1941 are also being auctioned.

Bader, by now a wing commander, lost his right artificial leg when he bailed out of his Spitfire over Nazi-occupied northern France.

The Battle of Britain legend was so respected by the Germans that when they announced his capture in a radio broadcast they also asked Britain for a replacement leg to be dropped.

A handwritten account by the RAF officer in charge of the drop describes how the leg was delivered into France by parachute after the Germans guaranteed the aircraft safe conduct.

Stoic: Despite detailing an accident which saw him lose both legs, Bader remained remarkably understated in describing it as a 'bad show'

Criticism: In one log, tells how Bader was rebuked for a 'poor performance' when he took too long in the air

Flight Lieutenant H.R. Spencer wrote: ‘The new leg was dropped by Blenheim of 18 Squadron just west of St Omer. The enemy fired at the descending package but did not damage it.’

The Germans confirmed its safe arrival via another broadcast.

It is the first time this document or the logbook have come on to the open market. The teleprinter message flashing news of the German radio broadcast that announced Bader was alive and had been captured is also being sold.

Insight: The detailed, handwritten notes in Bader's flying logbook describe the moment he lost both his legs as a 'bad show'

The logbook covers the start of his flying career in 1928 through to the near-fatal crash in 1931. It was acquired from Bader’s widow Joan by aviation enthusiast Ron Mitchell in 1990.

Mr Mitchell, 65, has loaned it to the RAF Museum in Hendon, North London, several times but has now decided to sell it.

The retired engineer from Norwich said: ‘It has sat in my safe for so long now I felt it really ought to be put out there to be seen again.’

Despite having no legs Bader was credited with more than 20 aerial victories in the Second World War and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.

As a prisoner of war he made a number of attempts to escape and was eventually sent to Colditz where he remained until it was liberated in April 1945.

Respected: A transcript of a message sent by the Germans tells how they asked for Britain to send over an artificial leg for the captured Captain Bader

Rare: The auction of the logbook will be the first time it has ever come on to the open market

His story was told in the 1956 film Reach for the Sky starring Kenneth More, based on the biography of the same name by Paul Brickhill.

After the war Bader worked in the oil industry. He also campaigned for the disabled, for which he was knighted in 1976, and continued to fly until ill health forced him to stop in 1979. He died in 1982, aged 72.

The items are being sold by Dominic Winter Book Auctions of Cirencester, Gloucestershire, on November 16.
