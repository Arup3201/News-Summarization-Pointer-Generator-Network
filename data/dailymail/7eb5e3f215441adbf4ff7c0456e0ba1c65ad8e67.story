Lewis Hamilton believes there is room for Formula One to prosper in the USA, praising their sporting fans as some of the most passionate he has ever seen.

The British driver was speaking at a press conference ahead of the Austin Grand Prix, where is looking to build on the 17-point gap between himself and Nico Rosberg.

Hamilton, who met with fans in New York on Wednesday, admitted he was surprised by the noise the event has generated since he arrived in the country.

'There's a huge market for Formula One,' he said. 'People in this country are so passionate about sports in general, Baseball, NBA, NFL, even Nascar. 

'There's lots of opportunity here for it to grow. People greeted me in New York and knew who I was!' 

'They've got good recipes for good shows, so I hope they take a bit of that and add it to this race and make it even more attractive.'

Hamilton was wearing a dazzling chain on Thursday as he strode around the paddock, which is a replica of the Andy Warhol painting 'Cars', commissioned by Mercedes-Benz.

The 29-year-old said he couldn't afford the full product, so showed off the next best thing.

Sitting next to Hamilton was Australian Daniel Ricciardo, who has impressed for Red Bull this season.

Despite being a rookie at the team he is sure to outscore reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel, and he was confident of scoring high points during a sure-to-be entertaining race. 

He said: 'It's exceeded my expectations and everyone else's few more races left and I'd still like to get a few top results. 

'This weekend is a good chance - it's the best circuit on the calendar for overtaking.'

Finishing off the conference in a comical fashion, Romain Grosjean, who has yet to score a point with Lotus this season, was asked about the news he is expecting a second child.

'At least that worked,' he chuckled.
