At the beginning of this month, my youngest child, Dolly, started school. Her tiny hand clutched mine as I urged her into the reception class and hung the blazer that swamps her still-tiny frame on to a peg.

Then, steeling myself, I quickly departed to brave the inevitable huddle of sobbing mothers in the playground - all bereft that their days of toddler groups and coffee mornings had finally come to an end.

By rights, I should have joined them in shedding a tear or two. Dolly is, after all, my fourth and last child. She is also, having just turned four at the end of August, the youngest in the entire school.

Yet distraught was the very furthest from how I felt. As I gave these women a cheery wave my, actual, overriding thought was: 'Hurrah! That's the last one out of my hair.'

So why have I decided to make Dolly start school even though she still requires a dummy for comfort and wears nappies every night?

The answer's simple. After 14 years of fitting my writing career around my brood's needs, I've had enough. The main reason she's going to school is because, shamefully, it makes my life a hell of a lot easier.

I know this makes me sound heartless. Even I'm surprised at my behaviour. Especially because the entire reason we decided to have Dolly was so that I could give up work and savour every precious moment with one last child.

She was born in August 2009 - almost seven years after the youngest of her siblings: Monty, ten, Annie, 12, and Flo, 14. After the madness of having three children so close together I craved to experience motherhood at a leisurely pace. I desperately wanted to try the whole stay-at-home thing. But then money worries drove me back to work when she was just ten weeks old. Poor Dolly went to nursery and I went back to my laptop.

Perhaps if I'd been a hands-on mother from the off, spending my days doing nothing more stressful than making things out of Play-Doh, I might feel differently now.

But the truth is that for me, and the majority of working mothers in the UK, the start of school comes as a blessed relief because it allows us - by law and general acceptance - to get on with our jobs with far less hassle and expense.

Today, there's no escaping the sense of freedom I feel at being able to drive away from the school drop-off knowing that the last of my offspring is squirrelled away for the next six hours and the day is all mine.

There are no complicated childcare arrangements to arrange and no guilt to contend with. I have convinced myself that my darling little girl is exactly where she should be.

So imagine my shock when I read last week that a coalition of education experts are now calling for full-time school to be delayed - by an astonishing three years.

Liberating: Shona loves the sense of freedom sending Dolly off to school gives her

The Save Childhood Movement, which has launched a Too Much, Too Soon campaign, firmly believes that the current UK education system is causing young children 'profound damage', because they are not being encouraged to learn through play.

Apparently the pressure of being in a classroom is too stressful for four years olds like Dolly. What they would like to see is for full-time school to be delayed - as it is in countries like Finland - until a child is six or seven.

Firstly, have none of these experts ever tried to hold down a job while juggling the demands and eye-watering cost (more expensive than private school) of a pre-schooler needing childcare?

And, secondly, don't they know that Finland has one of the highest rates of alcoholism in the whole of Europe? I'll wager there's a connection there.

Every working mother in Britain knows how stressful it is to continue a career with a small person metaphorically - and literally - clinging to your skirt hems. Booting them out to full-time education a little early is surely preferable to hitting the bottle?

Yet many will argue that I am a bad mother for shunting my daughter through a system she doesn't even - legally - have to be in yet.

And I'd probably concede they have a point. You just have to look at Dolly's furrowed brow in the mornings, or  the fact she falls asleep on the sofa at 6pm before I’ve even put her in the bath and read her a story.

After her first day at school she came home, wide-eyed with horror. 'If you do something naughty you get a red card,' she whispered, terrified. I still have no idea what a red card means because Dolly's too little to understand herself.

I could, of course, keep her at home. Current UK law dictates that a child doesn't have to be in full-time education until they are five. Yet you are strongly encouraged to start your children the September after their fourth birthday, and most parents happily oblige.

Either they're like me - desperate to claw back some career credibility - or just so competitive they can't bear the idea of their child being on an educational back foot because they've started behind their classmates.

All schools are different. We've gone private, which has afforded us some flexibility on the matter. The school's attitude is that I'm a paying customer and can therefore call the shots.

They've been amazing in their approach, telling me I can dip Dolly in and out of her reception year however it best suits me. I can keep her home a day a week or pick her up early if she seems a little tired.

But friends with children in the state sector haven't been so lucky. Some primary schools do stagger entry for summer babies allowing them to attend for half days until January - but after that they're just expected to get with the programme.

I know, deep down, that Dolly isn’t ready for school. But so liberating does it feel to get my life back that, despite the school's offer, I plonk her at their gates at 8.30am every morning, when I drop off her older brother and sister, and don't return to collect her until 5pm.

While the school day finishes at 4pm, she does an hour of after-school clubs so I can pick her up at the same time as her siblings.

LATE STARTERS

As well as Sweden, children in Denmark and Finland don't start school until they’re seven

I did, at the start of term, flirt with the idea of keeping her home on, say, a Wednesday, but it's amazing how my week fills up.

I'm not saying I don't feel guilty. On the drive to school, Dolly sucks desperately on her dummy like a death row prisoner having his last fag. As we arrive and I try to prise it from her mouth she begs: 'One last suck, Mummy,' before dejectedly leaving it behind in her car seat.

Of course, I adore my daughter and want to hang on to her early years as long as I possibly can. I also have a 14-year-old teenage girl, so I know how fast it whizzes by.

And it does, occasionally, tear at my heartstrings when I drop her off in the morning and turn back to see her standing, stoically, in the centre of the playground. She looks so small, so unsure what to do amid the throng of much older, bigger and more boisterous children.

Several times I have even been tempted to rush back, scoop her up in my arms and take her home for a day of cuddles and Mummy time.

But then I remember I need a quiet day to meet my deadlines.

So this morning I entered her bedroom with my usual sense of purpose, trying to ignore the fact she was on her stomach, just as she slept when she was a baby, her knees drawn up under her.

'Come on Dolly,' I said, pulling back the duvet. 'It's time for school.' She opened both eyes, looked at me sorrowfully and said: 'But Mummy, I already went, yesterday.'

I just didn't have the heart to break the news to her that yes - despite this indisputable fact - she has to go today, and tomorrow, too.
