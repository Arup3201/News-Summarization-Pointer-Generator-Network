A drugged up man who shot at police with a sawn-off double-barrelled shotgun after a six-hour manhunt with his partner in crime has been jailed for seven years.

Cameron James Brasher, 26, and his girlfriend Tereza Anne Loone, 28, taunted police after they stole a hire car and drove from a car park at Arthur’s Lake to the Tasmanian town of Poatina, 60 km from Launceston, on February 25 while berserk on methamphetamine.

High on ice during a ‘two to three month meth binge’, Loone posted a selfie of her and Brasher, on Facebook before he shot at police from the smashed window of the car.

It took 30 police vehicles, a helicopter and a 35km car chase on punctured tyres from police spikes before Brasher came to a stop, The Mercury reported.

When he did, he carelessly fired at police and when one officer, Constable Adrian Ayres, tried to arrest him he attempted to grab the officer’s gun off him.

During sentencing at the Supreme Court in Launceston on Wednesday, Justice Robert Pearce said: ‘It was extremely fortunate that police officers had not suffered serious injury. When he was fired at, Constable Ayres feared for his life.’

Police were engaged in a six-hour siege while trying to apprehend Brasher and Loone 

Brasher told the court he was upset over a custody battle when he carried out the terrifying crime.

He pleaded guilty to reckless use of a firearm, evading police, three counts of aggravated assault, resisting and threatening police, firearm offences and three counts of stealing.

Back in September, Loone was handed just a $900 fine for her part in the incident.

Police alleged they spoke to Loone on the phone during the siege, who essentially told them ‘back off or we will shoot’, The Examiner reported.

Their friends were seen leaving court after the sentencing this week

The Bonnie and Clyde style couple’s stolen Ford Falcon was just 10 metres away from a police car when Brasher fired two shots at officers.

When Loone appeared in court her defence solicitor Emily Judd, said that the 28-year-old had little memory of the time.

However, she said Loone remembered discouraging Brasher from committing suicide when he ‘was sitting beside the shallow grave that he had dug for himself’.

Police Association of Tasmania president Pat Allen told Daily Mail Australia they are pleased that Brasher was convicted but only 'reasonably pleased with the sentencing'.

'The effects on Adrian have been quite profound. He is not back to fully operational duty yet and doesn't want to be,' Mr Allen said.

'It's not as if he's not confident or capable, he is a brave man but what he is afraid of now is how he will react if it happens again.'

Mr Allen explained that Constable Ayres showed great restraint during the incident and did not shoot back at Brasher.

The Police Association boss said ice is an 'epidemic Australia wide'.

He warned that police have been given no training on how to handle people on the dangerous drug and 'crime rates are going up again in Tasmania'.

'Ice has become a real issue to officers on the street,' he said.

'I think the whole of Australia are suffering resource wise, I can see the problem getting bigger and bigger.'
