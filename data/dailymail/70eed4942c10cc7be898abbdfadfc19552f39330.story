Famed radio presenter John Laws has again shocked listeners after he berated an elderly man who began to break down on air as he revealed  he was sexually abused as a child.

During the interview on Thursday morning Mr Laws called the elderly man - known as Brian - a 'wet blanket' and suggested he should 'go to the pub and have a lemonade, for god sake'.

Mr Laws has come under fire after mocking an 80-year-old sexual assault victim 

In the ten minute chat Brian recounted several instances where he was sexually abused when he was only eleven and fourteen years of age.

Mr Laws quipped and chuckled that it 'took a little while for you to get around to talk about it.'

Brian then told Mr Laws that he had in fact reported two instances to the police but he was told to 'go away and forget about it. No one would do anything about it.'

It was at this stage Mr Laws added insult to injury as he told 80-year-old Brian that he should have fought the man off, as he himself had done when men had 'had a go' at him when he was younger.

The disgraced shock jock called the elderly man a 'wet blanket' and suggested he should 'go to the pub and have a lemonade, for god sake'.

'Did you scream in fright? Did you yell out 'stop that you bastard'? Did you lash out with your fists? Did you hit him?' Laws asked.

A meek sounding Brian responded 'no, no probably not.'

'I don't quite understand why you didn't lash out, you would have been a fairly big boy by that time. Didn't you kick or yell or scream or hit?'

Mr Laws continued to press the issue and said he should have told his family or his boss, who it turns out was responsible for several of the assaults.

Brian began to become audibly distressed at this stage when he explained he had no family support.

'No, we never had any uh, there was no such thing as ... family love,' Brian said.

He explained that his abuse was a contributing factor to why he had no girlfriend, no romantic interests and very little human contact.

Repeat offender: Mr Laws was criticised in 2013 after telling a female sexual assault victim that women who dress provocatively are 'rapebait'

Mr Laws then tried to salvage the conversation saying he should have felt better after speaking to him and getting it off his chest.

Brian responded that he was 'sad more than anything.'

Mr Laws then shockingly claimed the interview was a waste of 'both of their time.'

Brian continued to open up about his years spent in isolation after the attacks, trying to minimise human contact when Mr Laws thought it prudent to offer Brian some more sound advice.

In a flood of support for Brian many twitter users have called for Mr Laws to be sacked 

'Have you ever stopped and asked yourself, why don't people like me?

'You're not the happiest soul, I don't know that you'd make people who are around you feel all that good. Have you tried to brighten up a little? Difficult I know. 

'Do you hear me? But you're not taking any notice.

'You've got to be responsible for your own activity. You must make the move, go and talk to somebody about it.

'But don't be down all the time, don't be a wet blanket all the time. Try and have a laugh.

'Go to the pub and have a lemonade for god sake. 

He was met with silence.

'But don't be down all the time, don't be a wet blanket all the time. Try and have a laugh.'

'No? Well there's not a lot more I can do, is there?' 

To wrap up the uncomfortable ten minute conversation Mr Laws asked Brian to thank him for his time.

'Brian, could you say thank you?'

The interview draws shocking parallels to a conversation Mr Laws had with a female caller in 2013 who had also experienced sexual abuse. 

Mr Laws blamed the victim and claimed that women who dressed provocatively were 'rape bait'.

Twitter has erupted in support for Brian as listeners call for the so-called radio magnate to be sacked. 

The twitter community rushed to condemn the actions of Mr Laws labelling him a 'monster'

Sarah Monahan, the former co-star of Hey Dad! who was among actor Robert Hughes’ child sex abuse victims, chimed into show support for Brian and said she hopes he can see that there are people out there who do care. 

She added Mr Laws needs 'genuine help' after listening to the insensitive call.   

Sarah Monahan wants Brian to know that he isn't alone and people do care 

Karen Willis from NSW Rape Crisis Centre is among critics who say Mr Laws should be taken off the air.

'That man needs to hang up his hat,' she told Daily Mail Australia.  

She said the manner in which Brian was publically cut down after he had the 'courage to speak up' was 'completely irresponsible and unacceptable'. 

'Brian, could you say thank you?': Mr Laws insisted Brian thank him at the end of the awkward conversation

‘What we know  is that 40 years ago child sexual assault was rarely talked about. Children were told they made and any attempt they made to tell someone would have quite often  been met with rejection, punishment or blame,’ she added.

'After a lifetime of living with fear, to hear somebody they trust and respect to speak to them like that. It just reinforces a life of thinking it was their fault. It's just awful.’
