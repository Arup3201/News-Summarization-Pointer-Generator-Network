A woman who once weighed more than 25 stone is set to prove you can break unhealthy habits and change your life as takes part in the London Marathon on Sunday.

Abi Wright, from Rugby, used to overindulge every day on crisps, chocolate and takeaways and could barely walk - let alone run - because of her size.

But she swapped her unhealthy diet for one rich in fruit and vegetables and took up running - and hasn't looked back.

From obese to athletic: Abi used to weigh 25st, left, now she's 14st lighter and a runner who completed the Royal Parks Half Marathon last October, pictured right with her medal

Now 14st lighter and tremendously fitter, she's looking forward to this weekend's 26.2mile race.

Abi told MailOnline: 'I am feeling very excited but also nervous as this is a massive challenge. My friends and family will be supporting me along the route and I'm raising money for Air Ambulance which is a massive drive too.'

As she prepares for Sunday's race, Abi said she hopes she can inspire other people to pull on their trainers and get fit.

She said: 'I really hope people can see that hard work dedication and inner strength can get results.

'You
 don't need to have surgery, in my opinion is there is only one way to lose
 weight and keep it off, it's worked for me and many others. You need to 
learn about getting the balance. Healthy food and exercise has enabled 
me to get my life back.'

Before: Abi used to feast on takeaways and was a dress size 32-34, left. Now she's a size 12-14

While some of Sunday's runners will be constantly checking their mile splits and hoping to better their personal best time, for Abi, it will be all about finishing and putting her fat days truly behind her.

She said: 'When I was at my biggest the London Marathon was never an option. This is why Sunday is so special to me, I 
have worked so hard to prepare myself. Over the last few years 
I have dedicated myself to turning my lifestyle round and giving my body another
 chance.

'My aim for the marathon is to complete the distance, it is going to take all my inner strength I have to get round.'

Abi, who is in her thirties, used to weight 25-and-a-half-stone and was a dress size 32-34.

The territorial manager for a medical company admitted she had no self-control when it came to food.

'I kept gaining weight 
because I couldn't take control of what I was eating. Some people may 
have a pair of jeans and they know they've put on a few pounds if they 
become too tight so they cut back on junk foods. But I would just get 
the next size up in jeans.

Fat to fit: At her heaviest, Abi never believed she'd one day be running a marathon. She's completely changed her life after taking up running

'I tried diets but I couldn't get to grips with them, I didn't have the will power.'

It was becoming an aunty to Freya, Finn, and Faron that finally gave Abi the push she needed to change her life.

She explains: 'I could barely walk and I 
couldn't take them swimming or run after them at the playground because 
of my size. I wanted to be an active aunty so I knew I had to do 
something to get my life back.'

Abi started off by overhauling her diet. Multiple slices of toast at breakfast 
were swapped for muesli and she replaced the fizzy drinks she used to 
have regularly with water. The nightly takeaways were replaced with healthy homemade meals like fish and vegetables while she ditched chocolate and crisps for fruit when she felt peckish.

Abi then started exercising by running - something she had never considered herself capable of before.

'Running was such a big challenge for 
me. I was too embarrassed to be seen running on public roads so I went 
to a local reservoir and ran there instead,' she revealed. 'Just taking those first 
running steps was an accomplishment, it was such an unknown feeling, 
like someone trying skiing for the first time. At first I struggled to run a mile but I kept pushing myself.'

Inspiration: Abi let her weight creep up throughout her adult life but now she's an active aunty

Challenge: Abi can't wait to take part in this Sunday's London Marathon, cheered on by her friends and family

Her hard work paid off and the pounds fell off. She's now dropped to 11st, a dress size 12-14.

As Abi got fitter, she entered races, gradually stepping up the distances so she completed a 5K, then a 10K and a half marathon.

After completing the Royal Parks Half in October 2013, she said: 'If someone had told me three 
years ago that I would be running a half marathon, I wouldn't have 
believed them. I'm not proud of how big I was but I am proud of what I 
have achieved now.'

But she didn't stop there. Abi then signed up for this year's Virgin Money London Marathon and has been putting in the miles in training to prepare herself for the big day.

She's done all the hours of running alone but said she couldn't have done it without the support of her friends and family or those who have followed her journey via Twitter.

No longer embarrassed to be seen running, she's blogged about her training for Lunges and Lycra.

For those keen to follow in her footsteps, she has the following advice: 'My top tips are set small achievable goals, make sure you have family and friends behind you. Twitter is a great motivational tool you can follow me @abiwrightonit for my daily training and motivation.'
