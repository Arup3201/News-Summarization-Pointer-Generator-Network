The remnants of the fierce sandstorms which ripped through coastal towns in parts of Scotland and the North East were still visible today.

Forecasters yesterday announced the Baltic eastern winds responsible for the harsh winter had finally given way to the warmer Atlantic Jet stream, although some would have found this hard to believe as gusts of 70mph whipped up sand, covering roads and coastal paths.

Inverness Airport was left looking more like Dubai as a fine red haze descended and disrupted flights, while walkers were caught out in South Tyneside as strong gusts tore through the coastal towns.

Sand: The A941 Rothes to Elgin road, in Aberdeen, which was closed due to sand which had blown across the road

After the storm: The remnants of yesterday's sandstorms were still clear to see on this road in Aberdeen today

The rest of the country enjoyed 
temperatures rising to 6C higher than the average for April, making 
yesterday one of the warmest days of the year.

The
remnants of the coastal sandstorms were still clear to see in parts of 
Scotland today, as drivers made their way across the roads covered in sand. 

Temperatures hit a relatively balmy 17.6C on the Lincolnshire coast.

The best of the weather for the rest of 
the week will be seen in central and southern England with the area to 
enjoy temperatures of up to 18C tomorrow.

But temperatures will be cooler towards the end of the week, according to Met Office forecaster Charlie Powell.

He said: 'Tuesday has been one of the 
warmest days of the year. As well as the 17.6C recorded in Lincolnshire 
we've had 17.5C in Norfolk and 17.4C in Humberside. 

Sandstorm: A walker in South Shields, south Tyneside shields her face from the wind as heavy gusts catch the sand

Blowy: Heavy winds have shifted some of the sand onto the path in front of these two walkers in South Shields

Like a desert: The temperature might be getting warmer but these two dog walkers still donned heavy jackets yesterday as high winds battered parts of the North East

Strong gusts: While this woman shields her face from high winds her dog appears to be relatively unfazed by the weather

'That's around five to six degrees warmer than the average UK temperature for this time of year.'

And he said there was more good news for sun-starved Brits, with most of the country forecast to enjoy bright, sunny weather well into the weekend.

Mr Powell said: 'We have got some good weather to come this week, although there will also be some unsettled patches too.

Sandy: The coastal path in South Shields is barely visible after sand is whipped up onto the path by strong winds

'On Friday and Saturday we'll have good weather. By and large a lot of the UK will be dry and sunny.'

He added: 'The temperature on Saturday will probably not reach above 12C or 14C, but that is still 2C above average for the time of year. It's not going to feel cold.

'For most of the winter we've had a battle between cold eastern winds and the Jetstream, which brings warmer Atlantic weather.

'Now it finally looks as if we are seeing our weather coming from this Atlantic system.'

The warmest temperature recorded in Britain so far this year was 22C on March 6.
