A woman stabbed her brother to death with a carving knife at his housewarming party in a row over a cigarette, a court heard today.

Claire Gray, 22, had written on Facebook just hours before murdering Ashley, 24, that 'someone is going to get a knife in the neck like'.

Fed-up of her constant threats, the young woman's brother handed her a foot-long knife and challenged her to attack him at his party in Ferryhill, County Durham.

Murdered: Ashley Gray, 24, was stabbed to death by his sister Claire Gray, 22, after handing her a foot-long knife and challenging her to do it

But she followed through with her threat and knifed him once in the chest, Teesside Crown Court was told.

Today Claire Gray was jailed for life with a minimum term of just 12 years after admitting murder.

Mark Giuliani, prosecuting, said that Mr Gray 'went into the kitchen and returned with a knife and gave it to her,' then said words to the effect of 'go on then'.

Mr Giuliani said: 'She took the knife and stabbed him once to the chest.'

The weapon severed Mr Gray's aorta and he fell to the floor and he bledito death 'within minutes' on October 14 last year.

The court was told Claire Gray had served three years in a young offenders' institution for another knife attack and had only recently been released.

Mr Giuliani said that in 2009 Claire Gray stabbed Matthew Hodges 'numerous times to the head, neck and back'.

The court was told that Claire was aggressive when she arrived at the house party - hours after writing on Facebook 'nobody's stopping Claire bear'.

Mr Giuliani said: 'The mood of the party was a good one. The music was playing in the background, people talked, enjoying a drink.

Stabbing: The scene where Claire Gray knifed her brother to death at a house party in October. Today she was jailed for life at Teeside Crown Court

'The front door had been left open and guests were coming and going throughout the evening.'

But when she arrived at the party, Claire began threatening guests, insisting: 'I'm going to stab someone tonight.'

When Claire and her brother began arguing over a cigarette, Claire threatened to stab him and said: 'Get a knife, get a knife.'

Mr Gray went into the kitchen and returned with a foot-long carving knife which had an eight-inch blade and dropped it into Claire's lap as she sat.

Mr Gray told her: 'Go on then, do it,'

She then stabbed him in the chest in 'a complete rage,' the court heard.

As guests tried to restrain her, Claire again lifted the knife to stab her brother.

She was heard to say: 'I hope he dies' before leaving the house and walking to her grandmother's house.

Paramedics rushed to the scene as guests tried to stem the blood flow. But he showed no sign of life and he was later pronounced dead.

Police arrested Claire shortly after the attack and she shouted at officers: 'He f***ing deserved it'.

Claire initially denied stabbing her brother and insisted she had simply pushed him away as he tried to attack her.

However, today she admitted murder.

Brian Russell, defending, said it was a 'bizarre set of circumstances' that led to Claire being given a murder weapon to use by her victim.

He said Mr Gray was 'an author of his own demise' and that Claire would not have stabbed him had he not given her the weapon.

Mr Russell said Claire's earlier threats were just 'bluster' and she did not really intend to stab anyone that night until she was handed the knife.

He told the court Claire was 'devastated' over her brother's death and that she had held him in high regard.

Mr Russell said Claire's family 'very much want her back in their life as soon as possible.'

He said they consider Mr Gray's death a 'tragedy' and want Claire's sentence to be as short as possible.

As he jailed her, Judge Peter Fox said he accepted the attack was not pre-meditated.

He said: 'You are only 22 years of age. You have your life ahead of you.'

She changed her surname to Lock in February, but was referred to as Gray during the court proceedings today.
