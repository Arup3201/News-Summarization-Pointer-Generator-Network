A 'performance artist' was arrested after planting a suspicious bag at the finish line of the Boston Marathon on the one-year anniversary of the bombings.

While police have yet to confirm the identity of the suspect, CBS Boston has named the man as 25-year-old fashion designer Kayvon Edson.

After being arrested, Edson told police the bag contained just a rice cooker filled with confetti but a bomb team was brought in anyway to detonate it 'for precautionary reasons'. Another suspicious bag was blown up as well, but that one was mistakenly left behind by a news crew. The entire area was closed off to pedestrians for hours, and part of the green line on the light rail was shut down.

Friends on Edson's Facebook page are speculating that the incident was all part of performance art gone wrong. He has since been charged with disorderly conduct, disturbing the peace, and possession of a hoax device.

Witnesses first reported the suspicious bags around 7pm Tuesday on Boylston Street, just hours after survivors and politicians gathered in the same spot to mark the somber occasion.

They described the man who dropped off the bag as barefoot, dressed in all black with a black veil and 'acting strange'. As he left the scene, he was recorded yelling 'Boston Strong!' over and over again.

Police responded to the scene and quickly created a perimeter. A bomb squad was brought in and they surveyed two bags for hours before deciding to blow both up.

The first bag was detonated around 9pm, and the second 40 minutes later. The second bag contained photography equipment belonging to a reporting team.

According to his Facebook page, Edson is
 25 years old, studied at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New 
York and now designs his own line of clothing.

Earlier Tuesday, Edson changed his 
Facebook cover image to a picture of Boston Marathon bombings suspect 
Dzokhar Tsarnaev which read: 'Had a blast at the marathon!!!' Edson tagged the image with 'Tamerlan Tsarnaev and Dzokhar Tsarnaev is innocent'.

After Edson's name was released, people started commenting on the image, with one person calling it a 'pathetic attempt at "performance art."'

In a video on his YouTube account, Edson describes himself as a 'fashion designer, an entrepreneur, a performance artist, a mental patient, a blogger/bloggerist, a jailbird, a college dropout and a drag queen.' He also admits to being diagnosed as bi-polar.

Sympathizer? Edson posted this picture of Boston Marathon bombings suspect Dzokhar Tsarnaev on his Facebook hours before allegedly dropping off the bag at the finish line today

Mental health issues: Edson revealed in a YouTube video that he was diagnosed as bi-polar shortly after starting design school. Pictured above in screen grabs from a video on his YouTube account

The package's sighting comes on the 
one-year anniversary of the tragic Boston Marathon bombings in which 
three were killed and more than 260 injured.

Survivors and political figures gathered 
at the finish line earlier today to remember the victims in a ceremony, 
including Vice President Joe Biden.

The city is currently gearing up to host their first race since the national tragedy, which is set for April 21 - Patriot's Day.

Considering last year's massacre, officials have been planning security for months, doubling the police force and installing more than 100 surveillance cameras along the route.

Officials earlier said that there had been  'no specific intelligence indicating there is a threat to this year's marathon.'

'At
 this point, we don't have one, nor do we anticipate it,' Kieran Ramsey,
 an assistant special agent in charge of the FBI's Boston office said 
last month.

Two bags: The other bag found at the finish line belonged to a new crew

Remembering: The bomb threat came just hours after survivors and politicians gathered at the finish line to mark the comber one-year anniversary

Gathered: Vice President Joe Biden was one of the many who attended Tuesday's ceremony

Deadly: Three were killed and more than 260 injured in the twin blasts at the finish line last year, pictured in the above photo

Survivors: More than 100 people affected by the attack - including the Richard family (front left) and one of the two double amputees Celeste Corcoran (front center right) - gathered on Boylston Street Sunday
