A shipwreck discovered in Tonga is thought to be a famous pirate vessel that sank in the 19th century with a hold full of treasure.

Legend has it that the Port-au-Prince was attacked by warriors near the South Pacific archipelago in 1806 and most of its British crew massacred on the orders of King Finau 'Ulukalala II.

The British had captured the ship from the French and made into a privateer - meaning it had 
permission to attack and plunder boats belonging to 
rivals Spain and France.

The Tongans salvaged iron and cannon from the ship before the king ordered it to be scuttled [sunk] with its treasure still on board.

The vessel was thought to be lost until a local diver in the Ha'apai group of islands found wreckage with features similar to the folkloric ship last month, tourism ministry spokeswoman Sandra Fifita said.

If the wreck is indeed the Port-au-Prince, the treasure is likely to still be intact, she added.

'It is believed that a considerable amount of copper, silver and gold is resting with the wreck, along with a number of silver candlesticks, incense pans, crucifixes and chalices,' she said in a statement.

Thrilling find: Tongan King Finau 'Ulukalala II ordered his men to massacre most of the British crew, who were aiming to hunt whales migrating through the Pacific

What lies beneath: The wreckage has copper cladding typical of the period and features similar to the famous ship, according to Tonga's tourism ministry

Ms Fifita said the wreck had copper 
cladding on the boat's hull, which Britain's National Maritime Museum in
Greenwich dates to 1780-1850, when such cladding was used to protect 
against shipworm and marine weeds.

The distinction between a privateer and pirate ship is vague, since their work is generally the same - attacking and plundering other vessels.

Privateers are given government authorisation, allowing nations to disrupt their enemy's commerce and pressuring rival powers to deploy warships to protect merchant trade against the raiders.

At times, the practice has allowed would-be pirates to operate under a veil of legitimacy.

The cost was borne by investors hoping to profit from prize money earned from captured treasure, rather than from public money.

Britain used privateering as a way to intercept some of the wealth the Spanish and Portuguese were taking from the New World before beginning their own trans-Atlantic settlement, and a way to assert naval power before a strong Royal Navy emerged.

Local divers are now mapping the wreck for further study.

Resort owner Darren Rice, one of only
two divers to have visited the site, said it was located on a reef just
off the island of Ha'ano in an area renowned for its rough seas.

'There's
very little left of the ship, it's been pounded by four- to five-metre 
[13- to 16.5-foot] swells for 200 years, so there's wreckage scattered 
all over the sea floor,' he told AFP.

Mr Rice was reluctant to reveal too much about the wreck's location, fearing an influx of treasure hunters.

'We want to make sure the area's properly mapped and everything that's found is photographed and documented,' he said.

'If it's the Port-au-Prince then it's the most significant wreck in Tonga's history.'

Asked
if he believed there was a lost trove of pirate treasure on the sea 
floor, he said that if the ship is the one it is believed to be: 'It's 
there.'

He added: 'It will be well and truly buried by now and it'll take a lot of work to get to it.'

Adventurer's story: Teenage crew member William Mariner survived the massacre and became a favourite of the king, nicknamed Iron Axe, before returning home to tell his tale

Mr Rice said conditions would be too rough for further dives until November or December and the first priority would be trying the verify that the Port-au-Prince's final resting place had been found.

'That's the most exciting thing to me, not the treasure,' he said.

'Only one ship of that era has ever gone missing in Ha'apai, so if it's not the Port-au-Prince, what is it?'

The Port-au-Prince was originally built in France but was captured by the British and set sail from London in 1805.

After almost two years at sea, during which it raided Madrid's settlements in Peru and plundered Spanish ships, it planned to hunt whales migrating through the Pacific and made its way to Tonga.

A teenage crew member named William Mariner survived the massacre, eventually becoming a favourite of the king and adopting the name Toki Ukamea, or Iron Axe.

He stayed in Tonga for about four years before travelling back to Britain on a passing ship, recounting his adventures to amateur anthropologist John Martin in An Account of the Natives of the Tonga Islands.

The book remains one of the main sources for historians studying pre-Christian Tonga.
