The father of a 21-year-old woman who was allegedly stabbed to death this weekend by her girlfriend, 22, is shocked since he considered the suspect family. 

Casey Baird, father of stabbing-victim Tawnee Maria Baird, says he considered Victoria Mendoza to be like 'his other daughter' and was even helping her buy a uniform for her new job as a security guard.

The couple of five years allegedly got into a 'violent' argument while driving home from a friend's house early Saturday, when the row escalated and Mendoza pulled into a parking lot and stabbed her girlfriend, police claim. She then called a mutual friend, who rushed to the scene and dialed 911, it is said.  

'She's going to pay for this. It's ruined my life. I don't take death very well,' Mr Baird told the Desert News. 'To lose my one and only, it's unbelievable. I love you Tawnee. I just can't believe she's gone.'

However, Mr Baird says in recent weeks, he had noticed signs of potential domestic violence in their relationship.

About a month ago, Mr Baird noticed that his daughter's front tooth was missing and that Mendoza had scratches on her face and an injured hand. He says he 'bought' their story, which was that they had been attacked at a party.   

'I feel a lot of guilt I didn't dig into that tooth deal,' he said. 'I'm hearing little bits and stories from friends of Tawnee that Tawnee was living in fear of Vickie.' 

The two met five years ago, while in a youth treatment center, Mr Baird said. 

He says his daughter was admitted to the behavioral health treatment facility, after she was issued a ticket for possession of drug paraphernalia. 

Tawnee and Mendoza were a case of 'opposites attract', with Mendoza being 'very jealous' and protective of his daughter who 'joked around and was flirty, not that that's grounds for this heinous crime.'

Officers arrived at the parking lot at 2484 East Avenue in West Ogden at around 1am, where they found both Mendoza and the victim in the vehicle. Miss Baird was pronounced dead at the scene.

'We were actually responding on a call of a murder or someone wanting to turn themselves in for a murder,' Ogden Police Lieutenant, Tim Scott, said. 

'I can tell you [Miss Baird] was stabbed to death, I can’t give you the number of stab marks or stab wounds, that will be determined by autopsy.'

He added he could also not yet say what the fight was about, but that it was a 'violent, tumultuous encounter' that did 'culminate and lead to this incident where Ms Mendoza did stab her partner'.

Following the grim discovery on Saturday, police arrested Mendoza on suspicion of murder and booked her into Weber County Jail, where she is currently being held without bail.

According to Fox 13, Mr Scott said Mendoza has been cooperative during the investigation.

Investigators are now running background checks to see if Mendoza and Miss Baird had any history of domestic violence during the five years they were in a relationship.

Yesterday, Mr Baird wrote on Facebook that he was flying back to Salt Lake City from Alabama after hearing that his daughter  had been killed by a woman 'all of us tried to help'. 

'I love my lady bug more than I love myself,' he wrote on Facebook, referring to his daughter - who was a student at Salt Lake Community College - as his 'best friend'.

Speaking directly to Mendoza, he added angrily: 'Don't try insanity plea!!!! In fact I don't even want the death penalty!!!! I want you to sit in a prison cell and have plenty of time to rottttt!"

Mendoza will shortly appear in court charged with first-degree felony murder.
