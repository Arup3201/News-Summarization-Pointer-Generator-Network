A Democratic district attorney who has pursued Wisconsin Republican Gov. Scott Walker over alleged campaign finance violations told a fellow prosecutor that his crying wife, a union official, drove him to hunt the governor and his conservative allies because of his anti-union laws feared by organized labor.

The explosive revelation came Tuesday as lawyers for Milwaukee DA John Chisholm began two days of oral arguments in a Chicago courtroom over earlier rulings that effectively ended his wide-ranging investigation.

The investigation aimed to show that conservative groups were illegally working hand-in-hand with Walker's office when they ran 'issue ads' pressing the case that public employee unions should face reforms. Such arrangements, attorneys say, are common on both sides of the political aisle – including President Barack Obama's longstanding coordination with Priorities USA Action and other 'super PACs.'

Leaders of virtually every conservative political nonprofit in the Badger State, 29 in all, have found themselves swept up in Chisholm's criminal probe as they were hit with pre-dawn raids that seized their computers, cell phones, email records – and even a child's iPad.

in 2011 Wisconsin lawmakers passed Walker-driven legislation that was the most sweeping anti-union law in US history, provoking protests and marches by organized labor in the state Capitol

Armed police kept many of them from contacting their lawyers or corralling their children in some cases while they executed searches initiated by Chisholm over a period of a year and a half.

Republicans have accused Chisholm of using heavy-handed tactics, furthered by police using floodlights to illuminate suburban homes as flashing squad cars jammed driveways and cul-de-sacs.

None of the targets of the searches were ever convicted of any crime, and few were charged.

Since Chisholm prosecuted an unrelated 2009 embezzlement case that Walker's office urged him to take up when he was a county executive, conservatives have wondered why the DA expanded the probe into what Wisconsin insiders call a 'John Doe' investigation – ensnaring dozens of Walker's aides and allies once he became governor in 2010.

The John Doe proceeding, peculiar to Wisconsin, allowed Chisholm to enforce a gag order demanding complete secrecy from his targets and potential witnesses, prohibiting them from discussing the case, defending themselves in public or firing back when damaging documents were leaked to the press.

Chisholm has persisted despite defeats in every court that has weighed in.

Writing for the Legal Newsline, an American Media Institute investigator chronicled an interview with an unnamed Chisholm confidant – formerly a fellow prosecutor – to whom he explained his reasons.

Chilsolm's wife Colleen, he said, repeatedly broke down in tears and insisted he go after the governor following the passage of a 2011 budget law that trimmed the sails of the state's powerful public employee unions.

Mrs. Chisholm, a teacher, represented a union as her school's designated shop steward. Legal Newswire reported that she feared what would become one of the biggest reversals of labor power in American history.

His wife 'frequently cried when discussing the topic of the union disbanding and the effect it would have on the people involved … She took it personally,' Mr. Chisholm reportedly told his close associate, who has not come forward because he fears retaliation in the rough-and-tumble atmosphere of Wisconsin union politics.

Walker's law drew riotous protests from liberal groups organized by union labor, leading to months of marches and sit-ins at the state Capitol. Angry picketers harassed Walker in front of his home and some of the governor's supporters received death threats.

The activists were angry at Walker because their unions were to be required, for the first time, to contribute to employees' pensions and health insurance plans. The law also forbade them from collectively bargaining for benefits the went beyond wages.

Walker survived a recall effort in 2012, winning more votes than he had in his original 2012 election and fueling conservatives' hopes that organized labor's day in the sun had passed

Judge Rudolph Randa slapped down Chisholm's attempts to criminalize conservatives' political ads, saying that they could work with Walker's office as long as they weren't advocating for any candidates

The American Media Institute's source said Chisholm told him 'he felt that it was his personal duty to stop Walker from treating people like this.'

Mrs. Chisholm, like hundreds of teachers, joined in the protests. So did many members of her husband's ostensibly impartial staff, according to the source.

Chisholm's criminal probe widened 18 times, court records show. But ultimately judges at the state and federal level slapped him down and brought his investigation to a screeching halt.

U.S. District Court Judge Rudolph Randa ruled in May that the investigation ran afoul of Wisconsin law and the U.S. Constitution since it hinged on the idea that right-wing activists were illegally coordinating their ads with the governor's office.

That legal theory, Randa wrote, was 'simply wrong.'

Governments, he ruled, can only regulate issue ads run by outside groups if they specifically advocate for or against a candidate by name, offering 'express advocacy' or its 'functional equivalent.'

Referring to the heavy-handed raids, Randa vented that 'attempts to purify the public square lead to … the Guillotine and the Gulag.'

Chaos: Walker's law restricting public sector unions threatens to become a blueprint for other states' conservative activists, worrying labor leaders who have never seen their power diminished so quickly

Once and future president? Walker is touted as a possible 2016 White House contender; the kind of alleged political coordination with outside issue groups that drove the investigation against him reached its high point during President Barack Obama's two successful elections

Worse, he determined that Chisholm's prosecution team had  no 'reasonable expectation of obtaining a valid conviction.'

On Tuesday and Wednesday, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago heard oral arguments as Chisholm sought to overturn the ruling. 

American Media Institute president Richard Miniter, whose organization commissioned the story, told MailOnline that Chisholm's actions would be equally improper if he were a Republican.

'Abuses of the public trust are exactly what journalists should be investigating, no matter which party is to blame,' he said. 

'We launched this three-month investigation and hired a former New York Times Supreme Court correspondent to run it because it seemed like Chisholm was using his office to criminalize ordinary political activity,' Miniter explained.

'He told colleagues that his wife's tears motivated him to criminally investigate a sitting governor. The courts found that he had no legal basis. That should embarrass even the unions.'

Cornell Law School professor William A. Jacobson called Tuesday's revelations 'chilling.' 

'To date,' he said, 'no one has been able to explain why District Attorney John Chisholm has gone to the lengths he has gone to try to find criminal conduct that could taint Governor Walker. If this new information is accurate, now we know the motivation, and there needs to be an investigation of the investigators.'
