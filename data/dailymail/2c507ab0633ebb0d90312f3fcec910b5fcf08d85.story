America accused Russia of direct involvement in a ferocious bombardment of Ukrainian towns by rebel forces yesterday, as fears grew that last night's midnight ceasefire would not hold.

On one of the bloodiest days of the conflict, pro-Moscow separatists tried to grab more territory before the deadline.

The US ambassador to Kiev, Geoffrey Pyatt, produced satellite images which he said showed Moscow's role in the escalating violence.

The images purportedly showed Russian anti-aircraft batteries and artillery near Debaltseve, 45 miles north of Donetsk, the regional capital. 'We are confident these are Russian military, not separatists,' Mr Pyatt said.

Ceasefire: From midnight, troops on either side are supposed to be abiding by the agreement thrashed out in Minsk on Thursday

'The separatists now have a larger fighting force, with more tanks, armoured vehicles, heavy artillery and rocket systems, than some Nato and European countries.' 

Local police chief Vyacheslav Abroskin said: 'The rebels are destroying Debaltseve. There are non-stop artillery bombardments of residential areas. The town is in flames.'

Seven Ukrainian soldiers were killed and 23 wounded in 24 hours in a conflict that has killed more than 5,300 people and displaced a million civilians. 

Rebel leader Alexander Zakharchenko, head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, insisted he would not respect a ceasefire and called on Ukrainian troops under siege in Debaltseve to surrender.

If the fighting continues, the US may arm the Ukrainians, which could lead to the threat of a new Cold War. 

Last week a senior Obama administration official said Washington might consider sending 'defensive weapons' to Kiev if the Russians violated the ceasefire.

Ukraine's president Petro Poroshenko warned that he would put his country under martial law – essentially on war footing – in the event of a Russian breach of the deal.

Former head of the British Army Lord Dannatt, speaking exclusively to The Mail on Sunday last night, said: 'I fear the ceasefire will not last and in that event the best next step would be to press for international intervention and for a United Nations monitoring force to deploy to Ukraine in a bid to prevent further fighting.

'While Britain should commit troops to this force if invited, in the interests of neutrality it would likely be better that these soldiers were drawn from Germany and France.'

Earlier Lord Dannatt described the sale of Saxon armoured troop carriers to Ukraine as 'nothing short of immoral', as the vehicles were so decrepit as to be 'quite useless'.

They were sold by the Ministry of Defence to a private company in 2013 and then exported to Ukraine.
