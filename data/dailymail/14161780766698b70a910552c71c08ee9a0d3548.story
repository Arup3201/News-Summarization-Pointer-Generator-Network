From questionable flings to dodgy piercings, there are few teenagers who haven't made an embarrassing mistake or two.

But for Roger, a 32-year-old health and safety inspector, his teenage blooper has had lasting consequences.

Aged 15, he got a huge bulldog tattoo in the middle of his chest but when he tried to have it removed, he was left covered in scars - and with remnants of the inking still in place.

Gruesome: The pitted and scarred tattoo left on Roger's chest following bungled surgery to remove it

Big mistake: Roger aged 15 with the bulldog tattoo that has proved so troublesome

'It's been a long process for one mistake that I made,' he explains. 'It's all just one big ball of embarrassment.'

His problems began when he decided to get a tattoo of a bulldog in the centre of his chest when he was aged 15 - much to his family's horror.

'I was just horrified,' remembers Roger's mother Marion. 'It didn't do anything to enhance Roger as I knew him.'

But worse was to come when, 11 years later, he attempted to have it removed using a silicone solution intended to force the colour out.

'It was almost like re-tattooing,' remembers Roger, 'but it was done in a circular dot form and they injected a silicone solution in there that pushed the tattoo ink out.'

The results, however, were not what he'd been hoping for. Instead of a smooth tattoo-free chest, he was left with a collection of lumpy scars - and traces of left-over ink.

Thanks to the messy result, Roger was left with his self-esteem in tatters and says he is too embarrassed to take his shirt off in company.

'I've got a daughter,' he adds. 'I want to look forward to holidays where I can lie on beaches with my top off like any normal guy.'

Improving: Roger has now had laser surgery to remove the rest of the ink, although the scars remain

In a bid to finally rid himself of the disfiguring mess left by the bungled tattoo removal, Roger consulted Extreme Beauty Disaster's dermatologist, Dr Sam Bunting.

Her solution was a course of laser treatments to remove the remaining ink followed by steroid injections to rid him off the scarring.

Speaking after the first round of laser treatment, Roger said: 'I won't dumb it down and say it isn't painful at all because it does really hurt.

'But it's all just been a self-esteem killer. I'm really pleased with the progress I've made - I really can see an end to the entire issue now.

He added: 'I can already feel the difference in my life. My self-esteem is definitely on the up now.'

Roger appears on Extreme Beauty Disasters, tonight at 8pm on TLC
