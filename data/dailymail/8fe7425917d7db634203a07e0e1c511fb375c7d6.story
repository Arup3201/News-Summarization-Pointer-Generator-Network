A dominatrix and two friends who were accused of torturing one of her clients at knifepoint have been cleared of all charges.

The anonymous man was visiting 20-year-old Sinead Nijjer - who he had paid for oral sex twice before - when he claimed he was jumped by her friends Rico Awad and Leam Ryan.

He told a court that he feared his penis would be cut off, during an ordeal in which he was forced to suck Miss Nijjer's toes and told his face would be scalded with boiling water.

Cleared: Sinead Nijjer, 20, had been accused along with two friends of torturing a man who had previously paid her for sex at her flat in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire - but today the trio were cleared of all charges

But Mr Awad, 21, insisted on a different version of events - that an argument had broken out when the client enjoyed an hour-long domination appointment then refused to pay.

Today a jury took less than two hours to clear the trio of false imprisonment, robbery and common assault.

The trio had already been cleared of blackmail and causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent.

The
 jury also cleared a fourth man, 22-year-old Mohammed Awan from 
Aylesbury, of perverting the course of justice after he was claimed he 
offered the man £1,500 to drop his allegations.

During the trial the jury was told the alleged victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was held at knifepoint while he was forced to dance around in nothing but women’s underwear.

He also claimed he had his face cleaned with a toilet brush - all while being filmed, and was threatened the footage would appear online.

Claims: Sinead Nijjer (left) and Rico Awad (right) said Mr Awad came to the flat after the man refused to pay

Speaking from behind a screen, the man said he had visited Miss Nijjer's home on July 23 last year in the belief she would have non-domination sex with him for free, after he previously paid £50 for oral sex twice.

He told the jury that when he got to her flat, he was jumped on by two men including one wearing a balaclava and holding a knife.

'The man said if you do what we tell you then you won’t get hurt,' said the alleged victim. 'I was kissing her feet for maybe 15 seconds. She took a sip of her drink and sprayed it all over me.

'They were getting a buzz out of the whole thing... They were laughing all the way through. I was scared.

'What happened was real... I still have to live with it today.'

The man said he was able to escape when he exaggerated breathing difficulties he was having and one of his alleged captors called 999.

But Miss Nijjer said the alleged victim had come to her flat for a domineering session which he then refused to pay for.

Mr Ryan, 22, of no fixed address, said he was only at the flat in case things got violent between Miss Nijjer and the man, which he said they did when he refused to pay.

Missing: Miss Nijjer had not attended the four-day trial and a warrant remained in place for her arrest

And Mr Awad, from High Wycombe, said he only arrived at the flat after the argument over money began, and he was the one who called 999 when the man began having breathing difficulties.

In court the alleged victim was accused of making up the story to cover his embarrassment after paramedics found him in the flat wearing just women’s underwear.

He denied wanting to engage in a domination session, denied taking part in an hour-long appointment and denied telling Miss Nijjer: 'That was ****, I’m not paying.'

But the jury took just one hour and 40 minutes to clear all four defendants of all charges.

There were smiles from Mr Awan and Mr Awad in the dock and Mr Awad gave the jury a thumbs-up.

It came after Judge Francis 
Sheridan dismissed a blackmail charge against Miss Nijjer, Mr Ryan and
 Mr Awad, saying there was not enough evidence.

He also instructed the jury to find the trio not guilty of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent.

Mr Ryan and Miss Nijjer did not appear at the trial, and warrants remained in place for their arrests.

The pair have not been seen at Aylesbury Crown Court  since last year, despite numerous court hearings being held ahead of the four-day trial.
