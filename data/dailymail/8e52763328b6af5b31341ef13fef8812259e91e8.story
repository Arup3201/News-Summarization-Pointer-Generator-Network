With security measures so stringent at airports around the world, it is a wonder that he managed to hop his way past guards without being noticed.

Police were forced to lock down part of an Australian terminal building after a kangaroo surprised shoppers by creeping into a pharmacy.

The marsupial, who was pictured in the skincare aisle of the store, probably made his way to the right part of the Melbourne Airport - he had been hit by a car outside and suffered minor injuries.

The eastern grey male, who was nicknamed Cyrus, had to be sedated and carried out of the airport by wildlife volunteers.

As he made his way through the terminal, astonished passengers hurried out of its path.

Among them was comedian Julia Morris who wasn't joking when she sent out a Tweet reading: 'OK, so I'm at Melbourne airport & a KANGAROO has just jumped into the chemist.'

Cyrus was taken to a nearby vet's where his injuries were assessed.

Wildlife volunteer Ella Rountree said that an initial examination showed that Cyrus the kangaroo had injuries to his feet.

'His claws are quite worn and that's from hopping down the tarmac and things like that,' she said.

Mr Johnson Law, who works in the chemist's shop, said that at first he did not believe his co-worker when she told him there was a kangaroo in there.

'I just kept on doing what I was doing - I thought she was joking,' he said.

It is not the first time a kangaroo has caused a stir at Melbourne Airport.

In January a marsupial had to be shot with a tranquiliser gun after leading security guards and police on a chase around the terminal car park.

Another kangaroo, nicknamed Qantas, also had to be tranquilised in the car park in October last year.

The airport is located in an area of bushland which is frequented by the animals.

Fortunately, the runway itself is guarded so that they cannot hop onto the tarmac.

Although kangaroos are seen as largely placid animals, they can be aggressive towards humans.

A 2002 census of wildlife in Australia recorded almost 60million kangaroos in the country.
