Edgy Californian graffiti artist David Choe has been forced to deny he is a rapist after claims he made on a podcast caused outcry.

The artist, who made his fortune by asking to be paid in Facebook stock when he painted a mural at its offices, had told a lurid story about how he forced a masseuse to sexually stimulate him.

But after a backlash in which the artist and writer was branded a rapist, he has been forced to admit he had made the story up.

Defense: David Choe has admitted he made up a story about an encounter that led to accusations of rape

Shock jock: David Choe was accused of being a rapist over a tale he made up on his podcast

Choe had given his co-hosts on a podcast an explicit description of an encounter which he claimed at the time had happened in a Los Angeles spa.

He described his encounter as an 'erection quest' and gave a vivid description of forcing the woman massaging him to give him oral sex even though she had 'given me no signs that she's into me or that this is appropriate behavior'.

He added that the 'thrill of possibly going to jail, that's what achieved the erection quest'.

When his co-hosts pointed out his behavior was akin to rape, the artist had joked that 'she said yes with her eyes'.

His flippant attitude and description of forcing the woman into a sexual encounter caused outrage online after the podcast aired last month.

In response to the accusations that he was guilty of rape, Choe released a statement to Gawker saying he had made up the story as an extension to his edgy art.

Challenging: Choe says the lurid tale was part of his podcast's aim to challenge and provoke

'I never thought I'd wake up one late afternoon and hear myself called a rapist. It sucks. Especially because I am not one. I am not a rapist. I hate rapists, I think rapists should be raped and murdered.' he said.

'If I am guilty of anything, it's bad storytelling in the style of douche. Just like many of my paintings are often misinterpreted, the same goes with my show.'

The statement added: 'The main objective of all of my podcasts is to challenge and provoke my friends and the co-stars on the show ... It's a dark, tasteless, completely irreverent show.'

The artist had been harassed online for his massage parlor tale, with some concerned listeners even reaching out to Vice magazine, which he contributes to.

One of 
them, Darn Small, posted on the Vice Facebook page: 'Out of curiosity, what do 
you make of this story by David Choe ... is he admitting to raping a 
girl? I feel quite uneasy after listening to this.'

Others commented that his actions had been 'inexcusable' and that it had tarnished the way they viewed his art.
