A quick-thinking bank cashier helped catch a conman posing as a painter and decorator after he tried to swindle her elderly customer out of £1,600.

Alison Wheeldon became suspicious when the 85-year-old woman went into the bank in Allenton, Derby, to try to withdraw the sum of money from her account.

But after learning the money was to pay a man who had unexpectedly turned up at her door to carry out repair work, she asked if she could accompany the woman home.

But 'handyman' George Brailsford, 26, who had 18 previous convictions for 59 crimes, fled when she arrived realising he had been caught out.

This week, a judge praised the bank worker as he jailed Brailsford for 18 months.

Ms Wheeldon, who works at the Lloyds TSB bank in Allenton, said: 'I could see things did not add up as soon as the customer came over to my desk.

'I've worked in the bank for 26 years, and I've seen similar things in the past.

'I spoke to my manager, who agreed I could accompany the lady home, and we contacted the police.

'I'm so pleased things turned out OK for the customer in the end.

'I was only doing my job - we look out for our customers, and that's why we ask the questions that we do.'

Derby Crown Court heard that Brailsford had targeted the woman at her home in Shelton Lock, Derbyshire, offering to carry out painting and home improvements.

He originally told her the work would 
cost £800, but after just a few hours' painting then demanded £1,600 and
told the pensioner to go and withdraw the money from her bank. 

But Ms Wheelson asked why she needed so much money and after becoming concerned, she went with the woman back to her house.

Brailsford ran off but was later caught by the police covered in the same paint he had been using to paint her home. 

Recorder Andrew Maw told Brailsford: 'You are a thoroughly dishonest man. There is no doubt you have a tendency to prey on vulnerable, elderly people in the hope of getting easy, substantial amounts of money.

'It was only due to the perception and initiative of this bank employee, who should be publicly commended, that you did not succeed in taking this money.'

Jeremy Janes, prosecuting at Derby Crown Court, described how Brailsford had cold-called the pensioner's home in June.

Mr Janes said: 'Due to her frailty, she agreed. The initial quote was for £800, but relatively soon afterwards, more work was pointed out, and the quote went up to £1,600.'

Mr Janes said: 'Alison Wheeldon's suspicions were aroused due to a similar scam she was aware of in the area.'

Brailsford had been sentenced to 17 months in 2009 for similar crimes, charging pensioners thousands of pounds for 'urgent repairs'.

At the time, Judge David Pugsley called him 'evil, warped and twisted'.

Mitigating for Brailsford, Chris Hallas said: 'He understands, at the age of 26, and in light of his appalling criminal record, his mitigation is extremely limited. What motivates this man to offend is essentially alcohol.'
