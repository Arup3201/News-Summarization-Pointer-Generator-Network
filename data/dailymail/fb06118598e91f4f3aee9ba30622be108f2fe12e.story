Benjamin Wilson, from Billingham, was jailed for six years after admitting wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm

A son has been jailed for a horrific hammer attack on his father after snapping over tears of 'excessive and extreme' domestic violence.

Benjamin Wilson, from Billingham, was defending his mother when he beat his father Craig with a lump hammer

The attack left his father - who was described as a 'violent nasty drunk' in court - with brain damage and holes in his head. 

The 22-year-old, who is a new father himself, had grown up in 'an atmosphere of violence, fear and intimidation' and was subjected to violence himself.

He was jailed for six years after admitting wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, but the sentence has sparked outrage. 

Thousands of people have signed a petition calling for Benjamin Wilson to be freed.

The 'Free Ben Wilson' e-petition has more than 20,000 signatures from around the world, and a 'Help Free Ben Wilson' Facebook page has thousands of likes.

The petition, which was set up by Marie Taylor, says: 'Ben got 6 years for protecting his mother and himself from an abusive man under the influence of alcohol. 

'Ben has recently become a father and is not going to be able to bring his child up and give him a better life than what he was brought up in.

'Save this boy from more years of [torture] he has suffered enough and his family.'

Tammy Jones, from Portsmouth, wrote: 'He was defending his mum after years of both physical and to both mental abuse.'

Anita Homer added: 'This is appalling!!! We have a wonky, unfair and non standardised jurisdiction. 

'There are so many cases where a person has intentionally killed someone and only received very short sentences.

'This lad's behaviour was not intentional. He only wanted to protect his mom.'

Alex Loveridge, from Christchurch in New Zealand, added: 'I'm signing because even though using a hammer to stop someone is wrong in his circumstances it's completely justifiable and my heart breaks for him.'

Judge Simon Bourne-Arton QC told Teesside Crown Court that the case was a sustained attack with a 'fearsome weapon' on a defenceless man.

The court heard the 22-year-old, pictured, had grown up in 'an atmosphere of violence, fear and intimidation' and was subjected to violence himself

But he said the alcoholic father, described in court as a 'violent nasty drunk' had subjected his family to domestic abuse, and the son had been the victim of such abuse and violence.

Craig Wilson was described in court as a 'Jekyll and Hyde', who once served a two-year sentence for assaulting his wife.

During that assault on New Year's Eve 2007, the 46-year-old put both hands around his wife's neck and pressed so hard her eyes bled and she passed out.

Benjamin Wilson's sentence was reduced by the judge from 12 years to six, because of his good character and 'the degree and nature of the provocation that you've faced, not only on that occasion but on other occasions'.

Teesside Ctrown Court heard Craig Wilson was like 'Jekyll and Hyde' and once served a two-year sentence for assaulting his wife
