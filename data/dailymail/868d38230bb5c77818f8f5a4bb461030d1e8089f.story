Whistleblower: CQC board member Kay Sheldon says she cannot understand how some hospitals were declared safe

Hospitals with high death rates and poor care standards were registered as safe despite Britain's main health watchdog knowing there were serious failings, a whistleblower has revealed.

Kay Sheldon, who is on the board of the Care Quality 
Commission (CQC), said the organisation routinely ignored concerns at a number of 
NHS trusts despite being set up to protect patients.

The alleged whitewash came as the Mid-Staffordshire public inquiry into up to 1,200 unnecessary deaths was announced in 2010.

Patients there were so neglected they forced to drink stale water from vases, sit in their own excrement for days while others were sent home with life-threatening injuries or died following routine operations.

Kay Sheldon believes 'finding another Mid-Staffs had to be avoided at all costs', so the CQC decided to call potentially dangerous institutions safe as part of a cover-up.

'The Mid Staffs public inquiry was underway and it had been
said by Department of Health that Mid Staffs was a one-off and there was a real sense
that finding another Mid-Staffs had to be avoided at all costs, she told Radio 4's Today Programme. 

'There were a number of hospitals where the
problems were well-known and yet they were registered as fully compliant and
subsequently inspected as fully compliant.'

Among trusts concerned, she said, was the University Hospitals and 
Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust which is under police investigation 
following the deaths of a number of babies.

The CQC was set up under Labour in 2009 to replace three other quangos and improve standards.

Yet it has been hit with many problems in its short life.

Its head of the care was forced to resign with a taxpayer-funded pension pot of 
£1.35million last year.

Cynthia Bower (above right) agreed to leave after a damning official inquiry concluded it was not doing enough to 
inspect hospitals, care homes and GP practices properly - exactly what it was set up for.

The CQC has also been accused of rating hospitals as ‘good’ even though patients were dying from poor hygiene.

And MPs on the health select committee said it was more obsessed with box ticking than carrying out inspections of hospitals and care homes.

In 2011 the CQC annual report said it carried out 15,220 inspections in the previous year. It admitted later it was only 7,368.

Weeks later it emerged that the regulator had spent millions of pounds on plush refurbishments, staff junkets, Raymond Blanc meals and, staggeringly, more than £300 on Krispy Kreme doughnuts.

A total of 30 families are reported to be taking legal action against the trust over mother and baby deaths and cases of cerebral palsy.

Managers have been accused of covering up patient deaths as they chased the prize of foundation trust status.

Morecambe Bay became a foundation trust in 2010 despite warnings from the regional director of the NHS regulator that patients’ lives were in danger. In 2011 it had the highest mortality rate of any trust in England.

Ms Sheldon said the CQC was aware of serious problems at the trust in 
late 2009 and the beginning of 2010 but in April 2010 it was registered 
as fully compliant.

'It just doesn't make sense. There is no way that the trust could have turned itself round in two or three months,' she said.

'It seems to me that CQC gave assurance about the trust that wasn't actually accurate.

'It was a very shocking thing to find thinking that an organisation 
that's there to protect patients had effectively given what amounted to 
false assurance and that meant that problems in the trust carried on 
unacknowledged and unaddressed.'

She claims a total of 15 hospitals were 
being investigated over high mortality rates time, yet they were give a 
clean bill of health.

'It does raise the question as to why those Trusts were
registered as fully compliant.  It seems that the CQC knew about the
concerns, they knew about the high mortality rates - that is something that
I’ve only just become aware of - and it concerns me greatly that  CQC had
that info and yet registered these trusts as fully compliant at the time,'  she said.

Mrs Sheldon's was the Mental Health Act commissioner for 11 years and a trustee of charity Mind.

CQC Chief executive David Behan, who took over last year, said an 
independent review was under way into what happened at Morecambe Bay.

'The allegations that have been made are very serious,' he told the Today programme.

'I am absolutely committed that CQC will be an open and transparent 
organisation. We will publish this report and we will be accountable for
the work that we do.'

A CQC spokesman added: 'We are changing the way we inspect hospitals and making other changes to the way we work. These include strengthening the board and senior management team, for example by recruiting a chief inspector of hospitals, a chief inspector of social care and a chief inspector of primary care to lead our inspections.

'The matters Kay Sheldon have raised are not new and have been reported and discussed internally and externally. CQC is committed to being an open and transparent organisation, focussed on making sure health and social care services provide people with high quality care that they have a right to expect of health and care services.'
