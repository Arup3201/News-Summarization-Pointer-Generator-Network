It has already raised millions for ebola victims and is set to go to number one in the charts.

But the latest Band Aid single was yesterday branded ‘patronising’ by African academics and a rapper revealed he pulled out of the recording in protest.

Some said the revised lyrics of Do They Know It’s Christmas? perpetuate ‘negative stereotypes’ about Africa, and claimed it ignores the fact ebola has struck largely Muslim countries where most people do not celebrate December 25.

Sir Bob Geldof appeared on Sky News and said the concerns of critics, who have described the Band Aid ebola fundraiser single as perpetuating 'negative stereotypes' about Africa, were a ‘complete load of b*******’

Others criticised organisers Sir Bob Geldof and Midge Ure for undermining African singers who have released similar charity songs.

Meanwhile British-Ghanaian rapper Fuse ODG revealed he pulled out of the project last weekend because he disagreed with the lyrics, which have been revised since the first Band Aid track in 1984.

Writing on Twitter, the 26-year-old said he felt the message of the song was ‘not in line’ with his own thoughts on how to help Africa. Sir Bob supported his decision, adding: ‘He said he just felt awkward’.

But the Boomtown Rats star, 63, responded furiously to his other critics. Appearing on Sky News he said their concerns were a ‘complete load of b*******’.

The song, recorded by singers including One Direction and Ed Sheeran, is favourite to become Christmas Number One, having topped the iTunes charts already and become the fastest selling record of the year with 206,000 sales since it was released on Monday.

But Liberian academic Robtel Pailey, 32, who studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, said the lyrics are ‘incredibly patronising and problematic’.

She told Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘It paints the continent as unchanging and frozen in time. If you look at the revised lyrics, there are references to ‘them’ versus ‘us’.

‘And the fact of the matter is, if you look at countries that have been most affected by Ebola, the vast majority of the population in Sierra Leone is Muslim, the vast majority of the population in Guinea is Muslim. Yes, we know it is Christmas, but not all of us celebrate Christmas.’

When it was first released in 1984, the Do They Know It’s Christmas? came under fire for perceived inaccuracies and offensive lyrics.

At the time, the line ‘There won’t be snow in Africa’ was criticised by those who pointed out there is snow in some parts of the continent.

U2 singer Bono – who also recorded the latest version – later admitted he ‘loathed’ another line which said: ‘Well tonight thank God it’s them instead of you.’

This year, it was replaced with the words ‘Well tonight we’re reaching out and touching you’, while the line ‘Where the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears’ was replaced with ‘Where a kiss of love can kill you and there’s death in every tear.’

However, Miss Pailey said it was wrong to suggest that every person infected with Ebola would die, adding: ‘Death, doom and destruction. It is insulting.’

Others were equally scathing. Speaking to Al Jazeera news, Chitra Nagarajan, 31, a human rights activist from Nigeria, said she objected to ‘celebrities swooping in to “save” the people of Africa.’

She added: ‘It perpetuates stereotypes of conflict, poverty and disease as the single story of the continent.’

Abdullahi Halakhe, 31, a policy analyst from Kenya, said he thought the lyrics were ‘grotesque’, adding: ‘It was awful 30 years ago, and it’s awful today.’

Dawit Gebreselassie, 26, a financial analyst from Ethiopia said: ‘I would ask does Geldof know when it’s Christmas time in Ethiopia? As perhaps the fact that we celebrate Christmas a few weeks later on the 7th of January could have misled him into thinking we don’t know when it is.

‘Reassure him from us that, after his last three reminders, we are well aware and don’t need any more prompting.’

Miss Pailey said Band Aid should have supported African artists, such as Liberian musicians D12 and Kuzzy, who have released similar tracks to raise money for Ebola.

But producer Harvey Goldsmith, who helped create the original Band Aid and who produced the Live Aid concerts, said her concerns were ‘ridiculous’.

He told Today: ‘I think it’s disingenuous for people to turn round and say we shouldn’t do anything or sit back and watch it all happen or wait for all those countries that pledged aid and refused to give it so far.’
