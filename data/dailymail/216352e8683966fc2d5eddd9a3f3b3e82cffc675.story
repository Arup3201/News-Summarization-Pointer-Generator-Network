Harry Kirkham was killed as he crossed the road outside Erdington police station in Birmingham

A 15-year-old schoolboy was knocked down and killed by a police car while walking home from  church with his younger brother.

Harry Kirkham was run over by an officer on a routine patrol as he crossed the road outside Erdington Police Station in Birmingham.

The teenager suffered a heart attack and was rushed to hospital but died the next day.

Harry had been making his way home with his 13-year-old brother after attending a service at the nearby Potter's House Christian Fellowship Church when he was mowed down at 9pm on Wednesday.

The officer, from Sutton Coldfield police station, gave the youngster first aid along with a passing paramedic who witnessed the crash.

Police said he has been left 'traumatised' by the ordeal but has been questioned by detectives from the force's Professional Standards Department.

A local resident, who saw the aftermath of the incident, but did not want to be named, added: 'There were blue flashing lights all along the road.

'I saw one young lad being comforted by a police officer - he looks in absolute shock. He was in floods of tears.

'I couldn't see much else apart from blankets and a stretcher and lots of emergency services. I didn't get too close though, you don't want to be disrespectful.

'Its a busy road and a lot of people bomb up and down it - but you don't expect a police officer to, especially if he isn't attending an emergency. It's an absolute tragedy.'

Harry, from Kingstanding, Birmingham, suffered a cardiac arrested and was rushed to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital.

West Midlands Police confirmed the teenager tragically died as a result of his injuries yesterday afternoon.

Pastor Lewis Claxton from the Potter's House Church added: 'He was running across the road probably. He wasn't playing a game or anything like that.

'Just beforehand, his brother Max told me that they were just going to the shops so they were on the way there at the time.

'I think he just did not use the crossing and thought he could just rush across the road when tragedy struck.'

Chief Inspector Neil Hobson said: 'No parent should have to lose a child, particularly in such tragic circumstances.

'Our thoughts are with Harry's family following their tragic loss.

'As Harry was hit by a police car West Midlands Police has informed the Independent Police Complaints Commission who continue to be updated.

'The police officer who was driving the car at the time has been left traumatised by the ordeal but is providing every assistance to the investigation.'

The officer was on routine patrol in the area and was not responding to an emergency call when he struck Harry.

A relative who answered the door at the family's semi-detached home yesterday morning said his parents had been left 'heartbroken'.

He added: 'The family are too upset to talk. They are still at the hospital now.

'They are devastated and completely heartbroken.' 

Pastor  Claxton, 25, said Harry and his brothers had attended their services for the last three weeks.

Speaking outside the church today he added: 'I was standing at the door of the church when I heard what seemed to sound like a car crash or a collision.

'I ran outside, along with another person from the church. We saw a police car in the road, and we ran over to the young man, where he was put in the recovery position by the other man from the church.

'I went over to his younger brother who was very upset. We'd had a service at 7.30pm and the brothers had attended for the last three weeks.

'We had just began to get to know them. It was very traumatic.

'Harry was a wonderful young man. He was very popular, he was just wonderful.
