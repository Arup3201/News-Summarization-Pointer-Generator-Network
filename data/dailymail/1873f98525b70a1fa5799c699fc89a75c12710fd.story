An eight-year-old girl will spend her first Christmas alone after her single mother and younger sister were killed in a horrific car crash on Tuesday morning.

Jillian Sedivec, 28, and Savanah Wilson, four, died when their GMC Yukon plowed into the back of a Ralph’s grocery store big rig on the Interstate 5 near Oceanside, California.

Traffic investigators said it appeared Sedivec failed to brake as she approached the stationary truck, with her loved ones speculating she may have been tending to her daughter at the time.

Family and friends were devastated at news of the crash, which has left Sedivec's daughter Cydney an orphan.

Sedivec's father Jeff Sedivec, from Idaho, said his daughter was a loving mom whose life revolved around Savanah who was diagnosed with a genetic disease.

'I don’t know if either one of them could have survived without the other,' he told UT San Diego.

The family set up a Jillian and Savanah Sedivec Memorial Fund on FundRazr for Sedivec's surviving daughter.

'This fund is for Jillian's surviving  8 year old daughter Cydney and to help with the funeral and memorial expenses,' the online memorial fund says.

'The entire family appreciates everyone's thoughts and prayers as they endure this difficult time.'

Nearly $10,000 has been raised in donations for the family. Cydney is being cared for by family members.

Police said the grocery store truck was stopped in a
line of other trucks at the San Onofre Commercial Vehicle Enforcement 
Facility near the I-5 checkpoint around 9.20am, according to NBC7.

Witnesses said Sedivec, from Oceanside, didn't swerve to avoid the collision, however an investigation could take months. 

The truck driver was not injured and not at fault.

Sedivec's best friend Allison Kowalcyk told CBS8 she didn't believe Sedivec was driving irresponsibly before slamming her car into a truck.

'I don't believe in my heart there was any irresponsibility (on Sedivec's part). I believe that she was trying to tend to her daughter,' she said. 'Because she was so devoted to her.'

Friends say Savanah suffered from neurofibromatosis, a genetic disorder which caused tumors to grow in her legs and stunt her development.

Sedivec reportedly worked three jobs to support her family.

'Her daughter [Cydney] is left behind with no mom or sister before Christmas,' a friend told CBS8.

Crash scene: Police said the tractor-trailer rig was stopped in the right northbound lane of I-5, preparing to exit at the truck scales, when the crash occurred about 9.20am on Tuesday morning

Fatal: Traffic investigators said it appeared the driver of the SUV did not apply the brakes before the deadly crash

Damaged: Officials said the Yukon was wrecked so badly, investigators initially thought there might be a third victim inside

California Highway Patrol officer Jim Bettencourt told UT San Diego officers will look into Sedivec’s cellphone records to try to determine if she may have been using her phone before the crash.

'What she was doing before the accident, we just don’t know,' he said.

However, he ruled out alcohol or drugs as factors, and said Sedivec was wearing a seat belt, and her daughter was belted in a car seat.
