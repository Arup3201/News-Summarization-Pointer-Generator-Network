When it comes to race day, Katie Archibald likes to be organised. From what time she awakes, to when she will eat and warm up, no stone is left unturned.

It’s not a surprise then to hear that everything - right down to the colour she will dye her trademark technicolour hairstyle - has been planned ahead of her return to the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome.

Recent preparations have been made at the Team GB base in Manchester and an excursion to France for some outdoor velodrome racing with Laura Trott.

Going for gold: Katie Archibald is competing in five events at the Commonwealth Games for Team Scotland

All bases covered: Archibald will race both on the track and the road as she looks for glory in Glasgow

After being prepared for the impending competition, however, the arena which bears the name of one of Scotland’s favourite sons and the most decorated British Olympian ever is reopening its doors - and the 20-year-old from Milngavie admits that only when she reaches home and dons the Scotland colours again will she start to realise how far she has come and what she is about to do.

Archibald is no longer the unknown running rings around the opposition on grass tracks at the Highland Games, she’s a reigning World and European team pursuit champion who has more than justified her place with the elite British squad.

This is a star in the making who, with five chances of striking gold at Glasgow 2014 - on the track she will contest the 3,000m individual pursuit, points race and scratch race, whilst she will also hit the streets to tackle the time trial and road race - stands every chance of becoming a national hero.

An intriguing subplot reveals itself when asking her to assess her medal chances, however. As part of her everyday life, Archibald trains with the rest of Team GB in Manchester and that was still the case as recently as last Thursday when she was ‘doing team pursuit training as a GB squad, so that’s in the background’.

Her team-mates, such as English double Olympic champion Trott, and Welsh flatmate Elinor Barker, will be the competition.

‘I’ve got to feel good,’ says Archibald of the mission which lies ahead. ‘With the pursuit, it’s kind of odd that I’m training with some of the English girls and some of the Welsh girls and we’re all aware of the splits that everyone is doing.

‘I think we’re kind of ranking each other in our heads - and it’s close! I don’t know which way it’s going to go and, with the Aussies and the Kiwis, all we can work off is PBs. It’s going to be a tight cluster, with some close times.

‘Because we are all going well, I think it would be a bit awkward and tense if there was a clear disparity between us and it was obvious that someone was getting well beaten, but that’s not the case.

‘It’s all good competition. Nobody’s thinking: “Oh, I’m way ahead” and nobody’s getting angry, thinking: “Oh God, I’m really not going well”. It’s healthy but when we split and we’re all in our little pens, then I think you’ll get a few people taking sneaky splits and seeing what other people are doing!’

Closely-fought: Archibald is experienced and expects there to be a lot of tough competition in Glasgow

That’s not to suggest Archibald feels she has anything to fear. In fact, she has every intention of embracing any pressure which falls on her young shoulders.

‘I don’t think anyone loves that horrible feeling you get in your stomach, but I see the use of it,’ she continues. ‘I wouldn’t shy away from people talking about success because obviously I want to win.

‘Whether that’s realistic or not, it’s the attitude you’ve got to go to the start line with, so it would be fairly hypocritical if I turned round and tried to calm people and say: “Don’t go saying I’m going to get medals”.

‘When I was younger, I used to do that with my mum. I would tell her to be quiet because she’d lift you up so that you’re on top of the world and tell you you’re amazing and I didn’t deal well with it. I think, this time around, if people believe in me then that’s good.

Patriotic: Archibald is proud to represent Team Scotland and will give her all for her nation in Glasgow

‘I’ve got my mum, my dad, my gran and my brother coming (to the velodrome). I took my dad to a World Cup once and he got bored and left halfway through, so I’ m hoping there won’t be a repeat!’

With such a packed schedule, which encompasses the entirety of the Games, there will be little chance for Archibald to take stock or dwell on any achievements.

‘It’s not the British way, I don’t have time for reflection,’ she laughs. ‘I think we’re always looking for the next goal and the next target.

‘I guess the ultimate reward would be the Olympics, wouldn’t it, and the Commonwealths will have that same feel to it. I think, after this big event, it will be a test of whether I can embrace some success afterwards.’
