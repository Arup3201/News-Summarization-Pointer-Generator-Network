Two may be company, but – as the Duchess of Cornwall discovered yesterday – three is most definitely a crowd.

The 64-year-old was left looking a little lost on the sidelines as the Dalai Lama chatted and held hands with his ‘best friend’ Prince Charles during an informal meeting at Clarence House.

The exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, who is on a ten-day tour of Britain, spent much of the next hour praising the Prince of Wales.

Friendship: The exiled Tibetan spiritual leader also urged Charles to carry on his work

Praise: His kind words came after the prince, the Duchess of Cornwall and the spiritual figurehead held an informal meeting at Clarence House for around an hour

The 71-year-old said: ‘I always 
consider him a very close, best of friends. Right from the beginning, I 
felt “very nice person, good human”. He (has) proved a very wonderful, 
sensible, good human being.’ 

However, the duchess soon got a look 
in – she took the pair to see a magnolia spectrum tree the Dalai Lama 
planted in the royal garden during a visit in 2008.

He also urged Charles to carry on his
work and in touching scenes the pair held hands, touched heads and 
patted each other on the back during their time together.

The spiritual figurehead, who had grasped Charles' right hand, stopped in front of the waiting media and said about the Prince: 'I always consider him from my first meeting, a very close, best of friends'

Tour: The Tibetan spiritual leader is on a 10-day tour of Britain with a mission to spread his Buddhist teachings of peace and understanding to youngsters

Guide tour: Camilla stood slightly away from the pair as they looked around the gardens

Meeting: Clarence House would not release details of the discussions, only saying: 'It is a private meeting, the Prince of Wales sees the Dalai Lama as a spiritual leader'

The two men have obviously built up a strong rapport and at one point the Dalai Lama affectionately stroked the underside of the prince's chin making him laugh.

He also touched heads with the heir to the throne, another sign of how close the pair have become over the years.

Since the Prince last met the exiled 
spiritual leader he has held discussions with China's president Hu 
Jintao, raising the subject of Tibet during talks in London in 2009.

The
senior Buddhist figure arrived at Clarence House in a chauffeur-driven 
car and as he stepped into the doorway of the historic home the heir to 
throne appeared.

Visit: The royal couple took the Dalai Lama to see the magnolia spectrum tree he planted in the royal residence's garden following their last meeting in 2008

Friends: The pair looked to be in good spirits as they spoke to the media holding hands

Charles threw up his arms then placed his hands together in a prayer sign before hugging the Dalai Lama and sharing a few words with the spiritual figurehead.

Waiting next to the prince was Camilla, who kissed the exiled Buddhist leader before the group moved into the house's garden room for their informal chat.

The Tibetan spiritual leader is on a 10-day tour of Britain with a mission to spread his Buddhist teachings of peace and understanding to youngsters.

Clarence House would not release details of the discussions, only saying: 'It is a private meeting, the Prince of Wales sees the Dalai Lama as a spiritual leader.'

But it is likely they discussed the latest situation in Tibet and spiritual matters.

The Dalai Lama went on a brief tour of the Clarence House gardens and met around 80 of Charles' household staff who gathered to see the international figure.

Before leaving he touched foreheads with Camilla, and Charles again clasped his hands in front of himself before the royal couple waved the spiritual leader off.
