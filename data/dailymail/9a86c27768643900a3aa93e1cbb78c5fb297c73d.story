Radical preacher Abu Qatada has moved into a new taxpayer-funded house worth £450,000 near to a church – and the furious owner wants him out.

The fanatical Muslim, who preached hate sermons towards the West – arrived in the leafy suburb of North-West London last week.

He had left his previous £400,000 four-bedroom rented home near Wembley Stadium after apparently complaining it was too small for him and his family.

He shares his new detached home,  which is paid for by state handouts, with his wife and four of their five children. Similar homes in the area have sold for close to £500,000.

But the woman who owns the smart four-bedroom house reacted angrily last night after discovering the identity of her new tenant – and said she would try to evict him.

She said she was 'astonished' to be told the radical cleric had been allowed to live in the property, which she rents out through an agency for £1,400 a month.

Speaking from her home, the owner said: 'I had no idea who was living there. I have read about this man and why he was in prison, he does not seem like a nice character.

'A family member was living at the house until they recently passed away. Now we are letting it out via a local estate agent – who told me they would most probably let it to a member of their staff.

'We signed a contract with the company for six months but there is no way I would have given my permission to rent the house to a man like that – not ever.

'It is a very smart house with a nice garden and we hoped someone decent would be able to enjoy being there. This has left me very unhappy.' The owner yesterday contacted the estate agent to demand an explanation – but the company claimed that they did not know who was renting the house as they had in turn sub-let it.

'We are hoping to have a meeting on Monday to find out what is going on, we are very unhappy and I told the agents they have to sort this situation immediately,' she added.

'I do not want this man in my house and we will be taking steps to remove him if we can.'

It comes as the Government revealed the hate preacher has so far received more than half a million pounds in legal aid.

In a parliamentary answer Jeremy Wright, under-secretary of state at the Ministry of Justice, confirmed that as of December 5 the Legal Services Commission had provided £515,778 in funding.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: 'We must never lose sight of the fact that legal aid is paid for by the taxpayer. The total costs in some cases seem very high and many - myself included - will question whether they provide value for money.

'I am concerned about public confidence in the legal aid system. I have ordered an immediate examination of aspects of the system that affect its credibility with the public.

'Legal aid is a fundamental part of our legal system, but resources aren't limitless. Legal aid should be reserved for cases where there is genuine need.'

Neighbours also reacted angrily to Qatada's move yesterday as it emerged that two security cameras had been installed above lampposts opposite the house.

One neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'I had no idea who was living there. An old lady used to live there and she was always very polite and no bother at all.

'This is a nice area where people say hello to each other. But I can't imagine many people around here being too happy at having a terror suspect living next door.'

Another neighbour said: 'Two men spent an afternoon erecting two security cameras opposite my house. When we asked them what was going on they told us to call the police.

'But even now, when there are plain-clothed police outside our house, no one will tell us anything.

'It just isn't right we should have this stress brought to our doorstep. This is a very nice area for hard working, law-abiding people.'

However, the vicar at the church said: 'Absolutely anyone is welcome to our church and I would encourage Mr Qatada and his family to join in our Christmas celebrations and reach out to the local community – especially at this time of year.'

Yesterday two plain-clothed police officers kept watch on the house in an unmarked car. A woman, believed to be a Home Office employee,  visited the new Qatada residence at 10.30am and stayed for two hours.

Qatada was pictured wearing traditional Muslim robes as he left his former house in North-West London last Monday. Removal men were seen loading possessions, including a large satellite dish, into a van before driving off.

Qatada, 52, who has been described as Osama Bin Laden's right-hand man in Europe, remains on bail in London. Home Secretary Theresa May lost the latest round in her battle to deport him to Jordan, where he is accused of being involved in bomb plots against foreigners.
