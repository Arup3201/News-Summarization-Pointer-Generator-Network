A man glassed by X Factor wannabe Lucie Slater has vowed to make it as a swimming coach once again after he was forced to temporarily give up his career.

Scott Aitken, 27, needed 30 stitches and two hours of surgery after he was attacked by Ms Slater in June last year.

The attack damaged two nerves, cut an artery and forced him to give up work as a swimming teacher.

But the club DJ, of Ashington, Northumberland, has now returned to teaching the sport. 

On the night of the attack, Mr Aitken had been for a night out in Newcastle with Ms Slater before they returned to his home.

The former girlband member, who was 
thrown off X Factor for her crime, struck out when she allegedly 
discovered a message from another girl on Mr Aitken’s Facebook page.

Ms Slater, of Ryton, Gateshead, pleaded 
guilty to unlawful wounding and was given 51 weeks in prison, suspended 
for two years, with supervision and 120 hours of unpaid work.

Mr Aitken, who once swam for Great Britain, gave his former business 121 Making Waves swim school in Morpeth, Northumberland, to his partner following the attack.

After the attack, Mr Aitken required 30 stitches and two hours of surgery. He suffered damage to his nerves and a severed artery

Ms Slater and her band were booted off X Factor after the attack. She pleaded guilty to unlawful wounding and was given a 51 week suspended sentence as well as unpaid work

However, he is now teaching lessons again in Newcastle. ‘It’s going really well,’ said Mr Aitken, a former model.

‘I’m back to my normal self and I’m doing what I’m good at as opposed to doing nothing all day. It’s really rewarding knowing that I’m making changes to people’s lives.’

Mr Aitken teaches classes six days a week for all abilities and has also appointed his brother Ross, 21, to join his team.

Mr Aitken and Ms Slater were dating and she attacked him after allegedly finding a message from another woman on his Facebook page

‘Earlier this year they rang me to ask if I wanted to start teaching again and six weeks later I created my new business, Making Waves.

‘I was given a six month trial to see if it was going to be a successful and now it’s an on-going thing.’

He said: ‘I’m pleased I’m getting everything back on track. I have been given a great opportunity and I’m going to grab it with both hands.

‘I’m putting everything into it and it’s going really well. People who I used to teach have been so supportive and they have travelled with me.’
