Dozens of homeless Eastern Europeans are continuing to sleep rough in one of London's most exclusive neighbourhoods despite EU legislation giving authorities the power to deport those not actively looking for work.

Photographs taken today show a group of around 25 men and women, believed to be mainly Romanian and Bulgarian nationals, camped out on grass at the centre of Marble Arch - an area where homes can sell for tens of millions of pounds.

Last month a police operation saw around 37 homeless Eastern Europeans detained for questioning but resulted in just one person voluntarily returning home on a £200 flight paid for by the tax payer.

Problem: Westminster City council said that a group of up to 60 migrants, the vast majority Romanian, have been sleeping rough in Marble Arch over the suummer months

Rough 
sleepers can regularly be seen camping out in front of expensive shops 
on adjoining Park Lane and close to the plush Dorchester Hotel where 
rooms start at around £550 a night and rise to over £7,000 for a suite. 
In May this year a penthouse flat at One Hyde Park - a short walk from 
the camp - sold for a reported £140m.

Complaints from local residents and 
businesses include reports of Eastern European gangs begging, washing in 
fountains, dumping rubbish and defecating in public.

Speaking last month Mayfair hairdresser Hakan Altay's said the problem has been worse for his business than the economic crash.

He
 said: 'My business is down 20 per cent because of these gypsies. It 
didn't affect us straight away, but it's slowly killing it. Every single
 day we have problems. There is rubbish, the place smells terrible - I 
mean bloody hell, this is Mayfair.

'I
 had plants along the windows and they s**t and p**s in them. I was 
putting Christmas decorations up last year with my children and there 
was a guy p***ing against the window, I can't believe we still have this
 problem.'

Authorities have the power under European law to deport migrants, including those from inside the EU, who are not self sufficient or actively looking for work

Earlier
 this year the Government pledged that arrested foreign nationals would 
face deportation under an EU law that states those wanting to remain 
here must be exercising their right to work or be self-sufficient.

Westminster Council held 
high-level talks with Home Office officials about the issue, after the 
number of Romanian rough sleepers in Central London jumping from 20 in 
January to 59 in May.

A 
spokesman for Westminster City Council said there have been up to 60 
individuals rough sleeping around Marble Arch and Wellington Arch with 
the vast majority being Romanian nationals.

The
 Council has a team which works with the Metropolitan Police and Home 
Office Immigration Enforcement to assess whether people have a right to 
be here and then deal with them accordingly.

Cllr Nickie Aiken, Westminster City Council cabinet member for community protection: 'I want to stress that the council and its partners go to great lengths to support those in genuine need and help them with a route away from rough sleeping. 'Home Office Immigration already has the power to send home any EU nationals not exercising their EU Treaty rights, and the council will continue to work with the Home Office and Metropolitan Police to ensure that this happens.

'But the fact remains that the current legislative powers available do not go far enough and still allow some people to play the system and exploit a three-month window. We need tighter regulations.'

But 
Immigration and Security Minister James Brokenshire said the operation 
demonstrated that 'abuse of free movement will not be tolerated' and 
that action would be taken to remove perpetrators from the UK.

'We
 work regularly with police, local authorities and other agencies to 
identify and deal with EU nationals who are not abiding by the rules.

Despite
 the apparent difficulties in tackling the problem a police spokesman 
hailed last month's operation a success and said officers are working 
alongside the Home Office and Westminster City Council to address the 
issue.

Police 
Service Commander Alison Newcomb said: 'Operation Encompass has 
demonstrated the benefits of a multi-agency approach aimed to reduce the
 number of those sleeping rough and begging, which can lead to 
associated anti-social behaviour and crime.

is pictured talking to two police officers. Six boroughs in the capital 
were targeted according to police

'Officers
 work with immigration partners to utilise legislation launched in 
January regarding removal from the UK, where the grounds exist.

'They also make referrals to outreach projects in order to help vulnerable individuals break the cycle they find themselves in when sleeping rough, while taking affirmative action against persistent offenders who break the law or cause intimidation to passing members of public.

'Begging will not be tolerated in the City of Westminster or any other London borough. Wherever possible people begging will be arrested and ASBOs sought where appropriate.

'Our activity today is ongoing with our partners who are committed and recognise that it is an issue that does not go away in a single operational action and requires a continued and consistent approach from all agencies and partners.'
