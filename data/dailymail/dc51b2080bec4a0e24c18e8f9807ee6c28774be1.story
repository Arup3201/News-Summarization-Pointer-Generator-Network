A blogger was hacked to death by three Muslim attackers in Bangladesh's capital because of his anti-Islamic writings, police said today.

Washiqur Rahman Babu was declared dead as he was taken to a government hospital shortly after being attacked in Dhaka's Tejgaon area.

Two suspects were captured and three meat cleavers were recovered, Dhaka Metropolitan Police official Biplob Kumar Sarker said.

The captured suspects were students at separate Islamic schools and the third suspect fled the scene, he added. 

The killing took place a month after a prominent Bangladeshi-American blogger known for speaking out against religious extremism was hacked to death in Dhaka.

It was not immediately known what sort of blogging Babu did, Sarker said, adding that the suspects told police that they targeted him for his anti-Islamic writings.

Two of the victim's cousins told reporters at Dhaka Medical College Hospital, where Babu's body was being kept, that he had recently joined a travel agency in Dhaka after finishing his studies.

But they said they were not aware of any blog he had kept.

Local media reported that Babu had a Facebook page that contained the line 'Iamavijit', meaning he was a follower of Avijit Roy, the Bangladeshi-American blogger hacked to death  last month.

Roy, a Bangladesh-born U.S. citizen, died after he was attacked on Dhaka University campus when he was leaving a book fair with his wife.

A previously unknown militant group, Ansar Bangla 7, claimed responsibility for the attack. 

An Islamic extremist, Farabi Shafiur Rahman, was paraded in court earlier this month over the murder. 

The U.S. has sent a team of FBI investigators to Bangladesh to help probe the murder of the author of bestseller The Virus of Faith, who was visiting the city where he was born. 

The 43-year-old's family has accused Bangladeshi authorities of failing to do enough to protect him after he received death threats for his anti-religious writing.

Roy, the founder of the Mukto-Mona (free mind) blog, was born in Bangladesh to a family of scholars but moved to Atlanta, Georgia, around 15 years ago.

He and his blogger wife Rafida Ahmed, who was also badly injured in the attack, were hauled off their rickshaw by two assailants in the attack.

He was on his way back from a university book fair in Bangladesh when he was targeted on Thursday by at least two men over his opposition to religious extremism.

They sliced his head with the long blades before turning on his wife, Rafida Ahmed, and cutting her finger off when she tried to save him.
