Sutton Foster, the two-time Tony-winning darling of New York's Broadway, has revealed what it's like to completely shed her make-up for her latest starring role.

The 39-year-old Michigan-native, who plays the title character in Broadway's new production of Violet, spoke to ELLE.com about her passion for exposing issues related to 'vanity' and 'insecurity'.

'I am wearing nothing onstage. It’s a little scary, but it’s also kind of cool and exposing,' she admits.

Natural beauty: Sutton Foster, 39, opens up about hitting the stage make-up free for her new role in Broadway's production of Violet, claiming it's 'scary' but also 'kind of cool'

The musical production, which has been met with early critical acclaim, is set in 1964's rural American South and follows Violet; a character with a facial deformity who is on a journey to love herself 'scars and all', says Ms Foster.

She explains that she took on the 'challenging' role because she instantly connected with it, a far cry from the usual 'glamorous or over-the-top' parts she is used to playing.

The natural beauty, who has been described as 'the Jennifer Garner of Broadway,' also spoke about her new TV show, Younger, in which she plays an 'older' single mom who is struggling to find employment, and so pretends to be 26 and subsequently lands a job.

Voila! The Broadway veteran, who will also star in Sex and the City creator Darren Star's new TV series, Younger, says she has a passion for exposing issues related to 'vanity' and 'insecurity'

Ms Foster, recently engaged to screenwriter Ted Griffin and without children in real life, says she is over the moon to be working with legendary Sex and the City wardrobe consultant Patricia Field, whom she admits she is 'obsessed with'.

She describes how the 'Ah-mazing' Ms Field came up with a wardrobe for her character that was so 'crazy-awesome and ridiculous', it lead her to question whether 26-year-olds really wore these clothes.

Speaking of growing old gracefully, Ms Foster says: 'The thing is, I mean, I’ve been working for so long, everyone knows how old I am. And I’m not interested in hiding it, you know?'

But she later jokes: 'I just have to keep getting facials… and slowly I can sneak in lots of Botox! Do you think they’ll notice on camera if I just can’t move my face anymore?'

The Broadway veteran gushed about co-star Hilary Duff, labeling the ex-Disney starlet as 'the most mature' 26-year-old she had ever met, and recalling the time during filming when her dog died, and Ms Duff presented her with an iPhone case covered in photos of the passed-pooch.

As for her off-camera, off-stage beauty regime, Ms Foster says it's decidedly scant.

'I’m lucky if I run a hairbrush through my hair. I don’t really wear makeup at all unless it’s for work,' she reveals. 'I do moisturizer and I’m a sunscreen freak, and that’s about it.'

She does mention Skyn Iceland as her preferred skincare brand for sensitive skin, as well as Bobbi Brown's tinted moisturizer for its ability to 'hide things' without looking like she has make-up on.

MTV-owned network TV Land has confirmed that Younger will air 12 episodes, but are yet to announce a release date.

Violet will run on New York's Broadway until August 10th.
