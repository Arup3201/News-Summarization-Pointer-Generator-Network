If Eoin Morgan wanted to demonstrate that he is taking little notice of the outpouring of criticism that has greeted perhaps the worst of all England’s many under-achieving World Cups then he made a good job of it.

The unthinkable possibility of a first-round elimination will become reality if England lose to Bangladesh here on Monday, yet the England captain talked as if nothing has been learnt from three abysmal defeats. 

The subject of England’s over-reliance on statistics has become the hot topic of a long week of introspection in Adelaide but Morgan does not seem to have noticed, judging by his first answer in Saturday's pre-match interrogation.

‘Having a break has given us time to reflect and the analysis has come through which backs up our feel of what happened during the Sri Lanka game,’ said Morgan.

‘It makes things a lot clearer moving forward. It keeps it simple.’

Well, to put it simply, England were thrashed by Sri Lanka in Wellington by nine wickets with 16 balls remaining, when 309 became not nearly enough. Does it need analysis to tell Morgan that England under-estimated what a winning score would be and then bowled like drains?

Also, the key statistics in Gary Ballance’s World Cup are 10, 10, 10 and 6, his scores since being parachuted in to the side at the expense of Ravi Bopara on the eve of England’s first World Cup game against Australia.

Yet unless Morgan was being disingenuous to protect his man yesterday England, who tinkered with their team the day before the tournament, are now perversely going to be stubborn and again ignore the claims of Alex Hales. 

‘The decision we made to put Gary at three was a huge one,’ said Morgan. ‘There wasn’t much between him and Alex at the time and it was just a feel we had. It is a big decision to change anyone in the side and it won’t be taken lightly nor quickly.’ 

No one is doubting that Ballance has a bright future but right now, when England’s need is most acute, he looks rusty and short of the dynamism needed at this tournament.

If England really are determined not to pick Hales — and every indication here is that deep down they do not think he is the answer — then perhaps Bopara comes back into the frame with James Taylor returning to three. That would give England an all-important extra bowling option if their preferred tactic of bombarding the opposition with short deliveries from Stuart Broad, Jimmy Anderson, Steven Finn and Chris Woakes does not work again.

Defeat by Bangladesh in Adelaide would pile the pressure on England coach Peter Moores 

England have endured some rotten World Cups since they went close in 1992 and must beat Bangladesh

The big two of Broad and Anderson are just as big a worry as Ballance at three.

Both have taken just two wickets in this World Cup and their return in tandem for the first time in one-day cricket in two years has not been the bowling panacea England were counting on after losing in Sri Lanka.

‘It’s a difficult one really,’ said Morgan. ‘They are exceptional bowlers but have not been putting the ball consistently in the right areas and haven’t been able to take early wickets.’

England need all their under-performing players to come through now. They should beat Bangladesh — who gained an unexpected point when their game against Australia in Brisbane was rained off — at the Adelaide Oval to keep their World Cup flame just about flickering.

However, upsets do happen and Bangladesh have the ammunition to cause one.

The simple truth is, at the moment, England do not look good enough to challenge the best teams here. And they don’t need an analyst to tell them that.
