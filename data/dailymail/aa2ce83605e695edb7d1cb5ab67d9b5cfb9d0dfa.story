A new bus timetable is giving commuters a real pain in the neck - because it has been placed 7ft up a lamppost.

The sign, on a street in Rowley Fields, Leicester, is so high up that it it completely out of sight for some passengers.

Howard Parker, who spotted the sign, said the information board was so high up it was almost useless.

Bus users have been left with a pain in the neck after a bus timetable has been positioned seven feet up a lamppost

Anyone hoping to read the top of the sign would need the help of a foot stall or ladder.

Mr Parker said the position of the sign was 'useless'.

The 62-year-old said: 'I am about 5ft 9in and have pretty good eyesight, but I find it hard work to see the bus times.

Howard Parker, who spotted the sign and is 5ft 9, said the information board was so high up it was almost useless

'After studying it for a while I got a real crick in my neck.

'You would have to be 7ft tall not to have to crane your neck.

'I don’t know how anyone smaller than me or with worse eyesight is going to be able to see any of the information.

'The timetable is the normal small print and is going to be very, very hard for anyone to read if the information they need is at the top of the timetable.

'I really don’t know why anyone would put an information board up so high on a lamppost.

'It just doesn’t make any sense at all.

'The timetable is supposed to be there to help people but it’s not going to be much help if people can’t read the information, is it?'

Mr Parker spotted the notice when he was helping to cut the hedge at a church in the street.

He said he thought the shape of the lamppost, which has a 'bulge' on the lower part, might be the reason behind the placement.

However, he said: 'If they can’t put the timetable on any lower because of the shape of the lamppost, then surely it is better not to put it on at all.

'It is just no good to anyone as it is.'

Keith Myatt- spokesman for Arriva Bus -  said the company had an occasional problem with people moving timetables on lampposts.

'It sounds as if someone has pushed the timetable up the lamppost,' he said.

'I shall send out a team to reposition it at a more sensible height and tighten the brackets to make it more difficult to move in future.'
