They're hoping to prove the perfect partnership for the judges when Dancing On Ice starts next week.

However, when it comes to off the ice, it appears that Samia Ghadie and Sylvain Longchambon's real-life partnerships aren't going quite so well.

Coronation Street star Samia split from former co-star Will Thorp earlier this month following a two year romance, while Sylvain is also said to have ended his relationship with actress Jennifer Metcalfe.

Although Samia is getting all well with Sylvain, she is stunned by reports suggesting they are anything more than skating partners.

A source close to Samia told the MailOnline: 'She isn't dating Sylvain and they haven't seen each other for three weeks. There has been no date, there is nothing going on between them.'

However, a source close to the French professional ice skater revealed that Sylvain had been open with his current girlfriend, actress Jennifer, that he was developing feelings for his new co-star.

The Hollyoaks beauty was said to have thought it just a phase, so was devastated when he called her on Friday night from France - where he had flown to for Christmas - to tell her that their two-year relationship was over.Â

The source told the Sunday Mirror: 'When Sylvain first admitted that he had real feelings for Samia, she was gutted.

'It's been a difficult time but she thought it would pass. She has 
been putting on a brave face for the audiences... he is a consummate 
professional.'

It is sure to be a difficult concept for Jennifer, who is currently 
starring in pantomime, to accept as she and Sylvain met and fell in love
while working on the 2010 series.

At
the time, their on-screen chemistry was impossible to ignore, with 
Jennifer apparently inquiring as to his relationship status as soon as 
they first met.

Handsome couple: Sylvain Longchambon and Jennifer dated for two years after finding love on the ice

Since
the end of the show, the couple have remained together, even moving in 
together and happily posing at red carpet events until recently.

It
is as yet unclear if Samia, best known as Maria Connor in Coronation 
Street, shares the same chemistry with the handsome Frenchman.

She
has been skating with the Olympic skater since October, and in an 
interview with the Sunday Mirror's Celebs magazine, due to be published 
next week, she gushes about him - but refuses to discuss Will.

Hot stuff: Will Samia and Sylvain have good chemistry on the show?

She tells the magazine: 'I've only 
got good things to say. Sylvain is brilliant. He is so kind, patient and
thoughtful. I can see how you'd end up in a relationship with your 
partner. You get to know each other intensely and there is a lot of 
trust.

'They ask you what 
you want in a partner and I said, someone nice, someone strong, someone 
patient and someone with a good sense of humour, and he's got all that.'

When
asked if she gets annoyed with him for leaving her with aching ribs 
after training she says: 'No I couldn't, he's so lovely.'

Samia had been throwing herself into skating practice after quietly splitting from Will in early December.

Similarly, the Daily Star Sunday reports that friends of Samia claim she is seeing the French skater.

They add that Sylvain and Jennifer 
split after a 'rocky couple of weeks', at around the same time that 
Samia and Will's union drew to an end.

The
couple started dating in January 2011 - just a few weeks after Samia 
left her husband Matthew Smith after six years of marriage.

Lovers: Jennifer and Sylvain fell in love on the ice as they filmed the hit ITV show

In December 2010, Will - who played builder Chris Gray in the soap - had left his wife Samantha, mother of his two children. However, both Samia and Will insisted they didn't start dating until their marriages were over.

At the time Samia and Will's romance was made public, Matthew - father of her daughter Freya - said: 'They have to live with what they have done... She's my wife. I love her.'

Metcalfe's spokesperson declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline.
