Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny has posted a video of himself hitting an impressive mid-air golf drive on his official Facebook account. 

He was joined by fellow Poland international, Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski as the pair enjoyed some downtime ahead of the European Championship qualifying game against the Republic of Ireland on Sunday.  

Lewandowski threw the golf ball up in the air before Szczesny pulled off a perfectly timed strike to send it flying.

Szczesny has not played for Arsenal in the Premier League since a disappointing performance in the defeat by Southampton on New Year's Day, after which he was caught smoking in the showers.

He has made three appearances for the Gunners in the FA Cup victories over Brighton, Middlesbrough and Manchester United, but it is widely suspected that manager Arsene Wenger now considers David Ospina to the club's first-choice stopper. 

And former Poland goalkeeper Jerzey Dudek believes that Szczesny should look for a new club at the end of the season if he is to continue his international career.    

Dudkek told TVP Sport, 'If I were in his place, I would wonder whether there are still opportunities to arise at Arsenal and wouldn't wait as long as (Swansea City's Polish 'keeper) Fabianski, because you can see that Arsene Wenger is firmly set on David Ospina.' 

Szczesny has fallen out of favour at Arsenal and has not played in the Premier League since January
