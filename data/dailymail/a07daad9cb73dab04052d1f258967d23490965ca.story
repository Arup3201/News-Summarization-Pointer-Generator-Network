Most women dream of an hourglass figure - but for Penny Brown it has become an obsession.

Inspired by voluptuous cartoon character Jessica Rabbit, Penny has sculpted her bust to twice the size of her waist.

In the last two years, 25-year-old Penny has had two boob jobs taking her from an H to an O cup.

And the military wife has shrunk her waist from 38 to a tiny 23 inches by squeezing into rib-crushing corsets for up to 23 hours a day.

What a character: Penny Brown in her corset at her home in Okinawa, Japan

The character Jessica Rabbit appeared in the hit movie Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1988

Penny, who has been obsessed by Jessica Rabbit since childhood, first wore a corset to take some sexy pictures for her husband and became fascinated by the way it transformed her body

But despite her extreme proportions, she has no plans to stop.

She is now preparing for her third boob job and hopes to double the size of her already buxom bosom.

'I've always had a small waist, big hips and large boobs but I'm kind of a go hard or go home sort of person,' said Penny.

'I wanted to make that significantly more extreme, more dramatic, more stunning and more wonderful.'

Shockingly, the corset is so tight that Penny can't eat a proper meal whilst wearing it - as her stomach is so restricted.

Penny, pictured before she started to wear the corset (left) and today with it on (right), says the pain and discomfort of transforming her body into that of Jessica Rabbits has been worth it

Penny admits she is obsessed with big breasts and doesn't think her cup size will ever be big enough

Bending, sitting and lying down can also be a struggle.

Driving is very uncomfortable and any form of exercise is totally off-limits.

Extreme corseting has even been known to rearrange the internal organs, but Penny, a pin-up model, isn't worried.

Instead she says the curves of her idol are worth any discomfort.

'I've been obsessed with Jessica Rabbit from a really early age,' she says.

'I think she is incredibly sexy and there's a real power and strength to her character.

Within the first four months of corset training, Penny had lost 15 inches from her waist

Today Penny has a 26inch waist and a 55inch bust and is proud of her figure

Penny says that her new body has given her confidence after years of low self confidence, and she feels like is wearing protective armour when she is in her corset

'I've always wanted to copy that - at five I was already thinking about breast implants.'

Australian
 Penny, who now lives on the small island of Okinawa, Japan, embarked on
 her quest for the perfect hourglass figure two years ago.

She
 wore the corset in February 2012 to pose for some saucy snaps for her 
husband Cooper, 28, who was deployed overseas with the US Airforce.

But
 Penny was so fascinated by the effect on her figure that she began 
corset training - a method that involves shrinking your waist by wearing
 the tight-laced garment for long periods of time.

For four months Penny wore the corset non-stop, only taking it off to shower.

Penny says it has taken a lot of hard work and dedication and isn't concerned about the effect the corset training may be having on her internal organs

'It was tough at first,' she says. 'The corset is not a magical tool that will make your waist tiny in a few months.

'It really was hard work and dedication on my part.

'I stuck to little meals, and also things that incorporate liquid into the food - like smoothies.

'One
 thing that was difficult was not being able to eat my favourite spicy 
foods - because they would wreak havoc on my stomach when it was 
restricted in the corset.'

Disturbingly, corset training is known to move around the internal organs, but Penny isn't concerned.

She says: 'The stomach is an incredibly resilient thing - it can withstand being squashed.

'At first I wore the corset too much and I experienced some pain and discomfort, but now I know how much my body could handle.

Penny, here aged 10 in Australia, says she was obsessed with the cartoon character from an early age

'I found it difficult to sleep in the corset at first but it doesn't bother me now.'

Within the first four months of corset training, Penny had lost 15 inches from her waist.

In 2012 she had her first boob job, taking her from an already ample 34H to a 36J.

But Penny still thought her breasts were too small.

'I've
 always been obsessed with big boobs,' said Penny. 'The bigger they are 
the better and I don't think I'll ever be big enough.'

A year later Penny went under the knife again to boost her assets a further five cup sizes.

Today Penny has a 26inch waist and a 55inch bust and is proud of her figure.

She said: 'I love my body and my shape but I'd still like to have more extreme proportions.

'I'd
 never consider surgery anywhere but my breasts - but I'll keep having 
breast surgery until my boobs are as big as possible.'

Although she still wears the corset every day, it is only occasionally that she puts it on for 23 hours at a time.

And Penny's new shape has dramatically improved her self-confidence.

She explains: 'I've suffered with body image issues and low self-esteem for most of my life.

'But when I wear a corset I feel like I'm in armour or wrapped in a safety blanket.'

When out of the house, Penny often finds herself surrounded by admirers who want to have their picture taken with her.

Penny's husband also embraces her severe curves.

Despite receiving intense criticism from some people and even death threats, Penny says she has no intention of stopping

He said: 'Penny is as close to Jessica Rabbit as any mere mortal can get.

'Her shape is exciting and interesting. I don't like the ordinary or the generic.'

Penny does have her critics, however, and has experienced negativity about her look online.

She said: 'Some people don't agree with what I'm doing - they say I'm destroying my body and it doesn't look natural.

'I've even had death threats, but my appearance is for me and I love the way my body looks.

'Jessica Rabbit's figure is sensual, strong and extreme and it's a pleasure to replicate that in real life.'
