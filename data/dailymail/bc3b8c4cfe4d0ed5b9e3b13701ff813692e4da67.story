David Beckham earned over £20,000 per day last year, ten times as much as his wife Victoria 

He may have hung up his football boots more than a year ago. But it seems David Beckham’s earning power is still as strong as ever.

The former England captain, 39, picked up a £7.5million windfall from his company in the past year.

Exploiting the image rights of ‘Brand Beckham’ earned the ex-midfielder the equivalent of £20,548 a day – ten times greater than the dividend picked up by wife Victoria, 40.

The Spice Girl-turned-fashion designer paid herself £750,000 through her company Moody Productions, which channels earnings from her music back catalogue.

But the pair still have a stratospheric joint worth of £210million – thanks to her fashion empire, which last year made a profit of £1.4million, and his lucrative promotional contracts with companies including Adidas, clothing chain H&M and Sky Sports.

In the past 12 months, the former Manchester United star’s image rights company, Footwork Productions, made a turnover of £14.8million.

Although the figure was a fall of around £1.7million on the year before, it still allowed the firm to post a post-tax profit of £9.6million on ‘Brand Beckham’. 

The retired footballer picked up the bulk of the sum, taking a £7.5million dividend.

According to the director’s report: ‘The company’s principal activity during the year continued to be the exploitation of David Beckham’s name and image rights.’

Among his business deals, the ex-footballer sells his own branded fragrances through Coty Inc, has filmed adverts for Diageo’s Haig Club whisky, helped promote the Las Vegas Sands hotel and is a brand ambassador for both Sainsbury’s and Jaguar.

He has famously posed in his underpants for fashion house Giorgio Armani – and earlier this year promoted H&M’s Bodywear range.

But he hinted that his underwear modelling days are coming to an end, saying: ‘I’m getting older now, I’m not sure too many people want to see me parading around in my underwear much longer. My body’s still OK but it’s only going to be a matter of time before people are like, “Really? Again?”

‘I’m 39 years old, I’ve got four kids, I’m not sure people are comfortable with that any more.’

Beckham, who also played for Real Madrid during his football career, earned a £1.95million-a-year base salary with US club LA Galaxy in 2012.

He retired from the sport in May last year after five months at French club Paris Saint-Germain – where he donated his £170,000-a-week salary to a children’s charity.

The Beckhams are now based in London, where former Posh Spice Victoria has just opened a clothes store. 

After a reported £5million on renovations, they are moving into a £30million West London home with children Brooklyn, 15, Romeo, 12, Cruz, nine, and three-year-old Harper.
