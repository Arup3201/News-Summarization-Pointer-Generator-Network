Ed Balls has warned Ed Miliband not to be ‘stupid’ and allow Labour to be cast as the ‘anti-referendum’ party on Europe.

The Shadow Chancellor, who was last night forced to welcome David Cameron’s success in negotiating a lower EU budget in Brussels, said his party needed to be careful not to become ‘caricatured’ as the ‘pro-status quo’ party on the issue.

Labour leader Mr Miliband shocked colleagues by appearing to rule out an in/out referendum after the Prime Minister promised one last month, though aides attempted to undo the damage by saying he had not meant to do so forever.

Mr Balls, who is said to have been pressing for a more robust line on Europe for months, told the Yorkshire Post that he was happy with Labour’s position ‘for now’.

‘As long as we don’t allow ourselves to be caricatured as an anti-referendum party, which we’re not - we’ve absolutely not ruled out a referendum - I personally think that for now this is quite a comfortable position for us,’ the shadow Chancellor said.

‘If we allow ourselves either to be the “status quo party” on Europe, or the “anti-referendum party” on Europe, then we’ve got a problem.

‘But I think we would be pretty stupid to allow ourselves to get into either of those positions.’ 

In the Commons, Mr Cameron ridiculed Labour’s position - pointing out the party gave up a large chunk of the EU budget rebate won by Margaret Thatcher in 1984, and urging it to persuade socialist allies in the European Parliament to back the new deal.

The Prime Minister said he had fended off repeated attacks on what remains of the UK’s rebate, which he declared ‘safe’.

Mr
Cameron told MPs the UK had successfully rejected proposals by Europe’s
‘big spenders’ for an increase in the budget, as he won the backing of 
Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden for a reduction in the EU’s credit 
card limit.

He told MPs it was ‘disappointing’ that administrative costs were still six per cent of the total budget, but he was pleased spending on the Common Agricultural Policy would fall by 13 per cent on the last seven-year budget.

Mr Cameron launched a strong attract on EU officials who resisted budget cuts, claiming they see themselves as ‘higher beings who even refer to civil servants elsewhere as burger flippers compared to their lofty role’.

He also said the European Council should start its meetings in the morning rather than over dinner and into the early hours of the morning. Last week’s talks ran through the night and into the next day, taking 26 hours in all.

Sir Malcolm Rifkind: Mr Cameron had been 'successful at winning the most important reform in the EU budget since Margaret Thatcher'

A series of Conservative backbenchers, 
including some of his harshest critics, spoke to praise Mr Cameron’s 
budget deal. Former defence and foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind 
said Mr Cameron had been as ‘successful at winning the most important 
reform in the EU budget since Margaret Thatcher at Fontainebleau’.

Eurosceptic MP Mark Reckless, one of the leaders of a Parliamentary revolt against the Government over the EU budget last year, hailed the deal and said it would save every household £150.

However, the budget still needs to be approved by the European Parliament, where MEPs have caused outrage by suggesting that they might use a secret ballot to maximise the chances of it being rejected.

Mr Cameron said it would be a ‘very serious situation’ if the Parliament blocked the deal and condemned the idea of a secret vote.

He said: ‘I would encourage every MEP from right across the United Kingdom, whatever their party, to support this budget because it is better to have a deal than have no deal and this deal is right for Europe’s taxpayers.’ 

A Labour source said: ‘It is ridiculous to suggest there is a difference between Ed Miliband and Ed Balls on Europe. As Ed Miliband set out in his speech at the CBI in November, Labour believes our priorities should be to promote growth at home and secure influence abroad.

‘Both Ed Miliband and Ed Balls believe committing to an in/out referendum at the moment will not help either of these priorities.’

A Labour spokesman added: ‘The Labour Group of MEPs will be voting for the European budget deal agreed at the European Council summit last Friday.’
