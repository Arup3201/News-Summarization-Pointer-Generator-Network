Chris Christie has dismissed criticisms from Meghan McCain who said that she is 'kind of done' with talk of the New Jersey Governor as a possible Republican presidential candidate.

Christie was asked about the comments that the younger McCain made about him in a recent CNN interview and he brushed them away, saying that they meant nothing to him.

'People I have respect for, who critique me, I respond to... but I'm not going to respond to somebody just because of their last name,' he said during a radio interview.

Fighting words: Chris Christie said that Meghan McCain's comments were 'ridiculous and sophomoric'

Meghan McCain is the daughter of 
Republican Senator John McCain who ran against Barack Obama in 2008. She
has regularly spoken and written about politics and is now starring in 
her own reality show.

'If John McCain wants to say something to me, happy to respond to something John McCain says. Meghan McCain has no standing to be critiquing me, other than as a citizen, and as a citizen since she doesn't live in New Jersey, I'm not responding to her critique,' Christie said to NJ101.5.

'It's so ridiculous and sophomoric that I have no response to Meghan McCain.'

She was interviewed by Piers Morgan on Tuesday and weighed in on the prospective field of Republican presidential candidates for 2016.

Famous name: Meghan was a regular on the 2008 campaign trail with her father when he was running for president

Too close for comfort: McCain said that he spoke about himself too much in the National Convention speech, while others have had problems with his closeness to Democrats like Cory Booker (seen here together on Wednesday)

'I used to love Chris Christie, I'm kind of done with Chris Christie right now,' the 28-year-old said.

Her biggest point of concern appears to be his keynote speech at the Republican National Convention where he was criticized for failing to talk at length about then-candidate Mitt Romney.

'(Christie) just talked about himself the entire time and I think politicians obviously there's some level of self-promotion that you have to do, but I would like the next leader of the Republican Party and the next nominee to maybe be a little more interested in helping the country than just their platform,' she said during the CNN interview.

She said that she was talking about the frontrunners with her father's former campaign manager during his recent 77th birthday party and the unidentified aide suggested she support Jeb Bush, the brother of the younger President Bush and the former governor of Florida.

'They said point to Jeb Bush but I still think the Bush name is pretty tainted and I think he is much more conservative than people really realize,' she said.

'I like Marco Rubio, I don't really know.'

The war of words didn't stop there and after hearing Christie's comments, Meghan she took to Twitter and had it out.

'Regarding Chris Christie - I have respect for him as a politician, he is just not my first choice in a hypothetical 2016 run,' she said to her nearly 250,000 followers.

'If I am so "ridiculous" why is my opinion and name being brought up in interviews?

'And for the record, any American citizen in this country has the right to criticize any politician they want, it's part of the deal, sir.

'There's nothing better than a woman in her twenties giving her opinion and being dismissed as "ridiculous and sophomoric" - good politics.'
