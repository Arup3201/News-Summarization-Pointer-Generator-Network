A city lawyer died at his own 29th birthday party after falling down a disused rubbish chute in a block of flats.

Gary O'Donoghue, a solicitor at EMW Law firm, disappeared during a celebration friends had thrown for him at an apartment in Shoreditch, east London, at around 6am.

His body lay undiscovered for 24 hours, but was found by police at the bottom of the chute after officers searched the building.

Friends and teammates have paid tribute to the talented footballer who played for UCL Academicals in the Amateur Football Combination, saying he will be  'sorely missed'.

He was last seen at around in the early hours of January 25 at the flat in Quaker Street, off Commercial Street in Spitalfields and friends hunted for 12 hours before calling police. 

Police are treating Mr O'Donoghue's death as unexplained but at this stage do not believe there to be any suspicious circumstances.

Mr O'Donoghue had worked as a solicitor specialising in corporate finance at EMW Law firm, based in Chancery Lane, for more than five years.

He had previously attended Nottingham Law School and took his undergraduate degree in law at the University of East Anglia.

In a testimonial on the firm's website, he described his passion for his job, saying: 'I joined the firm in 2009 as a trainee and have not looked back since.'

Mr O'Donoghue's family were today too distressed to comment on their son's death.

Stuart Richards paid tribute on Facebook saying: 'I lost a pal this week - one of my football boys. Twenty-eight years old. Went missing after a birthday night out and then found dead a day later.

'The sadness comes in surreal waves. One minute I'm all punning on him being a left-winger - haha, politics - the next I'm pulling over on the side of the road in tears.

'It's like a glitch in my day-to-day thought continuum. A state of affairs that despite the very real, conscious acceptance of his death, just doesn't quite compute when you stop properly reflecting and let things be.

'I didn't even know him that well, but he was someone who as skipper I expected to turn up every week. Almost still do. Without exception he'd create a goal or bag himself.

His friend David Hagan wrote: 'I will sorely miss Gaz.'

Egbertian FC ‏tweeted: 'Our condolences to friends, teammates and family of @UCLAccies player Gary O'Donoghue who passed away last week. RIP'

A Met Police spokesman said: 'We were called to Quaker Street on January 25 at 6pm after a man was reported missing. We searched the property and the man's body was found. We are treating the death as unexplained.'
