A British soldier's body was paraded like a trophy after his capture and execution by the Taliban, it was claimed last night.

The Ministry of Defence was investigating reports from Afghan elders that enemy fighters displayed Scott McLaren's corpse before dumping it in a canal.

A member of the 4th Battalion (The Highlanders) the Royal Regiment of Scotland, he was snatched by insurgents after inexplicably walking off from a remote base in southern Afghanistan.

Highlander Scott McLaren was said by his commanding officer to be 'a man with a big heart and a true friend to many. He had a heart of gold'

The colleagues of the Scottish soldier described him as a man of 'true grit' with a 'heart of gold'.

Friends and relatives paid tribute to the soldier, from the Sighthill area of Edinburgh, whose death dealt a 'huge blow' to those serving alongside him.

A statement released on behalf of his family - parents James and Ann, sister Kirsty and brothers James and Ross - read: 'We are deeply saddened by the news that our dear son Scott was killed in Afghanistan. We were extremely proud of Scott.

'He loved the Army and despite his short time in 4 SCOTS had made many friends.

'Scott was a beloved son to James and Ann and brother to Kirsty, James and Ross. His family and friends; Grandmother Evelyn, Uncle Graham, Aunty Heather and close friend Michael will miss him dreadfully. We will always be thinking of him.'

The 20-year-old's body was found about three miles from Checkpoint 
Salaang, in the Nahr-e-Saraj district of Helmand province. Hundreds of 
troops, armoured vehicles and helicopters had searched for him.

Abdul Ahad Helmandwal, a local elder, said Highlander McLaren was grabbed by insurgents near the village 
of Kopak and killed a short distance away.

He said: 'They took his body to show the other Taliban that they had 
killed a British soldier. The other Taliban kicked the body and they 
threw him in the canal.'

But General Sayed Malook, commander of Afghan forces in Helmand, claimed
 the soldier drowned going for a 2am swim in the nearby Nahr-e Bughra 
canal.

He said the abuse happened after locals pulled the body from the canal: 
'When they found the body the Taliban in the area started trampling on 
him, stabbing him and even shot him.'

But senior UK defence sources dismissed the claims. They said Highlander
 McLaren had 'died of two gunshot wounds', including one to the back of 
the head that indicated he was executed.

One insider cast doubt on the suggestion he had gone swimming: 'Who'd go
 for a dip in the middle of the night on their own in an area littered 
with IEDs?'

Yesterday officers from the Royal Military Police's special 
investigations branch flew to Checkpoint Salaang to begin piecing 
together the events leading to the soldier's death. Required by military
 law to investigate all service deaths, the RMP will interview 
colleagues of Highlander McLaren as well as his commanders.

A senior Army officer who recently returned from Afghanistan suggested manpower and morale were problems at small bases.

He added: 'They are very remote and on their own and because we have so 
few soldiers on the ground commanders are being forced to deliver more 
capability with insufficient resources.

'Some of these bases are run by one officer on his own and the senior 
sergeants and corporals are pushed to their limits so they often cannot 
watch everything that their men are doing.

'Most of these bases are in or around the green zone and have a small 
stream or parts of the Helmand river running through their areas and the
 blokes do try to cool down there when it is safe.

'But because some of these bases are quiet it is easy to become 
complacent and take what you think are acceptable risks. The word is 
this chap took a 9mm pistol and went for a swim after his duty ended.'

Speaking in the Afghan capital Kabul, David Cameron said the slaying 
showed the 'high price' Britain was paying to bring peace to 
Afghanistan.

But the Prime Minister insisted the campaign against the Taliban was 
succeeding and plans to hand control of security to the Afghans were on 
track.

He will confirm to Parliament today that he has agreed to make only a 
'modest' cut of up to 500 soldiers by autumn next year, leaving a core 
of around 9,500 troops.

The 375th UK serviceman to die in the ten-year conflict, Highlander 
McLaren joined the army in August 2009, training at Catterick before 
being posted to Germany.

Within three days of arriving in Afghanistan he
 was involved in capturing a Taliban commander and finding a huge haul 
of IEDs.

He was said to be one of the fittest soldiers in his platoon and a 
'shining star' who would get up 15 minutes before his colleagues.

His 
commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Alastair Aitken added: 'He was a 
man with a big heart and a true friend to many. He was trusted by all 
and had a heart of gold.'

Major James Cross, Officer Commanding D Company, said: 'Highlander McLaren's death has come as a huge blow to all of us who have had the privilege of serving alongside him.'

Lieutenant Colonel James de Labilliere, commanding officer of Combined Force Nahr-e-Saraj (South) and 1st Battalion, The Rifles, said the soldier had been tasked with 'some of the most demanding' work during his month-long attachment.

Captain Callum MacLeod, Officer Commanding Fire Support Group and Multiple Commander, D Company, said Highlander McLaren was the perfect example of 'what makes a Scottish soldier great'.

'He was cool under pressure and unrelenting in the face of the enemy,' the senior officer said.

'The Multiple has been robbed of a friend, and the Battalion of a talent that was only just beginning to shine.'

Major Justin Barry, Officer 
Commanding B Company, echoed his praise for the young soldier who, he 
said, would be remembered as a 'quiet, yet fiercely dedicated and loyal'
 member of the Company.

Defence Secretary Liam Fox said he was 'deeply saddened' by news of Highlander McLaren's death.

'He was a brave and well liked soldier, praised by his seniors and admired by his colleagues,' he said.

'I understand from his commanders 
that he was the most conscientious member of the platoon who could 
always be relied on and who will be greatly missed.

'My thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends at this difficult time.'
