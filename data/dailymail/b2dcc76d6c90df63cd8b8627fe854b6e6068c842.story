Charles Clarke told yesterday how he was confronted over a rumour that he was having an affair with his ‘blonde, attractive’ special adviser.

The former Labour home secretary told the hacking trial that Westminster gossip surrounding his relationship with Hannah Pawlby was ‘completely untrue’ and that he had threatened to sue a newspaper if it published the claim.

News of the World journalists began a  surveillance operation after learning of the rumour and the tabloid’s investigator Glenn Mulcaire eavesdropped on the Home Office special adviser’s phone messages, the hacking trial heard.

Evidence: Former Home Secretary Charles Clarke arrives at the Old Bailey, where he denied having an affair with his former aide Hannah Pawlby, also pictured today, who was herself a hacking victim

Mr Clarke, 63, and Miss Pawlby, 34, both denied any suggestion they were involved in a sexual relationship and no newspaper printed the claim.

But the prosecution allege the rumour set a hacking operation into action at the News of the World.

Features editor Jules Stenson sent editor Andy Coulson an email in May 2005 which said: ‘Lewis [Panther – a journalist] has had a tip that Home Secretary Charles Clarke is having an affair with his blonde, attractive special adviser Hannah Pawlby.. 

‘He got this from a Westminster insider who fancied Pawlby, was going to ask her out and was told “Don’t bother wasting your time, she’s with Charles”.’

The newspaper’s chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck watched Miss Pawlby’s house for any sign of the Home Secretary while  Mulcaire recorded messages from her mobile phone, the court heard.

He was alleged to have gathered information about her parents, her grandparents and friends of the family, including one whose  husband was the head of the intelligence agency MI6. 

In the dock: Former News of the World newspaper editors Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson

Mr Clarke – who described the House of Commons as ‘a gossip mill’ – told the Old Bailey he was unaware of the rumours until he was confronted by journalist Trevor Kavanagh, who was then political editor at The Sun.

He said: ‘Trevor Kavanagh said he had  evidence of such an affair and said he would try to get it sympathetically covered in The Sun if I confessed and gave him the story. I said that there was absolutely no basis for him to have any such evidence as such a relationship did not exist.

‘As there was no substance to it at all, I wasn’t prepared to discuss it with him and I said that we should just end the conversation, which we did.’ Miss Pawlby was also approached by another journalist from The Sun about the rumour and Mr Clarke said he decided to call the newspaper’s editor Rebekah Brooks ‘to make it clear that such a story was completely untrue’.

She was away at the time and Mr Clarke said he spoke to her deputy and threatened to sue for libel if the story was published.

Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC asked Mr 
Clarke, the Labour MP for Norwich South for 13 years until 2010: ‘Was 
there any truth in that rumour?’

He
 replied: ‘Absolutely not. I have never had a relationship of that kind 
with Hannah. I wouldn’t dream of doing so and the suggestion is 
completely untrue.’

Hacker: Glenn Mulcaire, pictured at an earlier hearing, has already admitted he intercepted voicemails illegally

The story was never published. There was no suggestion that  Mr Kavanagh was involved in hacking or that The Sun had learned of the affair rumour through hacking.

Under cross-examination from Alison Pople, for Coulson, Mr Clarke agreed he had met the News of the World editor but said Coulson had never mentioned the rumour to him.

The jury was played a series of recordings of voice messages from Miss Pawlby’s mobile phone, including two from Coulson in June 2005.

In the messages the News of the World editor said he needed to speak to the then home secretary about a ‘serious story’ the newspaper was intending to publish.

Miss Pawlby said she never heard the messages because they  were stored on her phone as ‘saved’ as a result of being hacked.

She was Mr Clarke’s diary secretary when he was education secretary and became  his special adviser when he moved to the Home Office in 2004, a promotion she said was ‘unusual’.

She told the court she had been aware of a rumour about a relationship circulating from 2004 until 2006, but added that there was no truth in it.

The court also heard Mulcaire had hacked Lord Archer’s acquaintances following his 2001 conviction for perjury.

Mulcaire and Thurlbeck have both  admitted being involved in phone hacking. Coulson and Brooks, both 45, deny  conspiracy to hack phones.

The trial continues.

Victim: Kerry Katona was repeatedly hacked by Mulcaire from 2005, pictured, including on Christmas Day

Atomic Kitten singer Kerry Katona was persistently hacked by Glenn Mulcaire, including on Christmas Day 2005, the Old Bailey heard.

Days later, on New Year's Day 2006, a story appeared in the News of the World about problems the 33-year-old was allegedly having with ex-husband Brian McFadden's mother.

Her details, including her address in Warrington, Cheshire, phone and voicemail numbers, PIN code and password, were in one of Mulcaire's notes dated November 29, 2005.

News editor Ian Edmondson made three calls to Mulcaire that day and another four the following day, phone records show.

Ms Katona's phone was then hacked by Mulcaire four times on November 30 in the space of three hours.

The singer, who had already been exposed in June that year as a cocaine user, was on the front page of the December 4 edition of the News of the World under the headline: 'Kerry in new coke shocker'.

Mulcaire hacked her phone again in December, and made more notes on her boyfriend Dave Cunningham, pal Neil Clucas, and ex-husband and Westlife singer Brian McFadden.

More hacks followed in January 2006, and a new note was made by Mulcaire including details on her 'new man' Mark Croft, his Warrington address, and his place of work ABBA Cars.

The court heard Edmondson texted Mulcaire on March 2 before Ms Katona's phone was hacked three times by Mulcaire.

An email sent by Mulcaire to Edmondson on June 1, 2006, with the subject 'katona' included five mobile numbers, one landline number, and the phrase 'fav no's'.

The jury have been sent home until Monday, when the trial continues.
