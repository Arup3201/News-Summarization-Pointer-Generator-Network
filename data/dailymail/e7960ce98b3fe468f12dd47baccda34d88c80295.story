Rangers will hold informal talks with the SFA board on Tuesday over the possibility of Mike Ashley significantly raising his stake at Ibrox.

Ibrox chief executive Derek Llambias revealed the meeting at a stormy club AGM on Monday, which saw further complications emerge in the board’s fight to plug an £8million gap.

A resolution to grant them power to issue new shares without first offering them to existing stakeholders was defeated – which the board admitted will ‘limit its options for future funding’.

Mike Ashley currently owns an 8.92 per cent stake in Rangers

Ashley is still central to hopes of financial stability but the Newcastle United owner – who owns 8.92 per cent of Rangers - is currently limited to a 10-per-cent stake by an agreement made with the SFA in 2012.

Their rules state that no individual can have influence at two clubs without the prior permission of the board.

Rangers and Ashley are already facing Notices of Complaint from the governing body about alleged breaches of the existing agreement. Tuesday's talks are, however, being treated as completely separate from that disciplinary case, which will go before a Judicial Panel on January 27.

It’s believed Rangers approached the SFA in September about the prospect of Ashley raising his stake to around 27 per cent but didn’t then follow up on a request for a detailed business case.

The Sports Direct cannot own more than a 10 per cent stake in the club due to an agreement with the SFA

There has since been further contact between the two parties and now the SFA board, which was already due to meet, will hear from Llambias ahead of any formal request to alter the limit placed on the Sports Direct tycoon.

The former Newcastle United managing director may argue that Ashley – who has already loaned Rangers £3m - is the only hope of avoiding further financial disarray in the New Year.

Responding to a question about how the club intended to deal with the situation regarding Ashley and the SFA, Llambias told the AGM: ‘Due to the charge levelled against the club and Mike Ashley, we are now not able to comment on that. We are seeing the SFA tomorrow (Tuesday) and then we’ll have a clearer picture of what they are expecting of us.’

Derek Llambias could argue that Ashley is the only hope that Rangers have of securing financial stability

Former Rangers director Paul Murray believes Ashley must deliver a statement of intent about his plans for Ibrox.

Speaking after the AGM, Murray said: ‘Mike Ashley has to come out and be clear about what he wants to do with the club. Are his interests Sports Direct or are they Rangers?’

The defeat to Resolution 9 on the AGM agenda – relating to the wider share issue - suggests one major shareholder voted against it, with fingers of blame being pointed behind the scenes last night.

All three current PLC directors were re-elected but chairman David Somers polled only 61 per cent, substantially less than the backing delivered to Llambias and James Easdale.
