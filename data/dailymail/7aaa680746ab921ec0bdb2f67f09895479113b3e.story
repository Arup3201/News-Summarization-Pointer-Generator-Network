We are a nation obsessed with food programmes such as The Great British Bake Off, Masterchef and Saturday Kitchen

And we have bookshelves bursting with cookery tomes by Jamie Oliver, Raymond Blanc and Nigella Lawson.

But overworked Britons are so busy and tired that we can't be bothered to cook, opting instead for evening meals of quick-fix dinners eaten straight out of the packet whilst standing up in front of the fridge.

Considered a breakfast staple, toast is a dinnertime meal at least twice a week for half of survey respondents 

In a typical week, 60 per cent turn to make-shift meals such as cheese and crackers, ham sandwiches and packets of powdered soup, a study of 2,000 adults revealed.

1. Toast (49%) 

2. Cereal (33%) 

3. Ham sandwich (33%)

4. Crisps or nachos (27%)

5. Packet or tinned soup (26%)

6. Cheese and crackers (26%)

7. Instant rice/noodles/pasta (22%)

8. Crumpets (21%)

9. Chip butty (19%)

10. Sausage roll or pasty (18%)

Getting home late, making do with what's in the house and being too tired or busy to cook were just some of the reasons overworked Brits gave for scrabbling mismatched food together on week nights. 

Toast, cereal or a similar snack is on the menu at least twice a week. 

While the average adult eats a hot meal cooked from scratch four times a week, nearly a third said they often eat their dinner straight out of the packet, rather than serving it on a plate. 

A quarter (25 per cent) claim they are so hungry when they get home from work that on occasion they rush straight to the fridge and eat their evening meal standing up.

The survey also found four in ten Brits regularly have a bowl of cereal in place of a hearty evening meal. 

But 41 per cent said it was because they fill themselves up on bigger meals at lunchtime to justify having a light bite in the evening.

The poll found one in four adults lie about what they eat because they are embarrassed about what they have eaten or are planning to eat.

One in two think having an easy meal makes them look lazy and 29 per cent feel like they have a limited repertoire if they snack on sandwiches and cereal.

And 23 per cent say they lie about their meals because the basic food they eat makes them appear uncultured.

One in five lie because they do have time to cook proper meals but can't be bothered, and a third lie because they know what they are eating is unhealthy.

Not surprisingly, 36 per cent of respondents said they do worry about their nutritional intake because of the food they eat.

The poll was conduced by Pukka Pies.

Rob Dixon of Pukka Pies said: 'We can all relate to the feeling of being too exhausted to cook when we get in after a long day, and try as we might, we can't bear the thought of peeling, chopping and cooking the traditional meat, vegetables and gravy from scratch.

'The vast majority of workers want something quick and tasty before they dash off out again or collapse in front of the TV.

'Every now and then, we can get by on a quick fix like cereal or toast, but most of the meals in the list are not even hot.

'During the winter months especially, it's important to eat a hot evening meal, rather than eating the first thing we find in the fridge.'
