This is the dramatic video showing an aircraft touching down at 45 degrees after being caught in fierce crosswinds at a busy airport.

The passenger jet can be seen attempting to land amid powerful gusts of more than 50mph and lashing rain at Birmingham Airport.

Footage, posted on YouTube on January 31, appears to show the aircraft pointing at a 45 degree angle in an attempt to counter the effects of the storm moments before touching down.

Rain and wind batters the aircraft during its descent while at times the conditions are so bad, the runway is barely visible - but for the landing lights.

But eventually, the pilot appears to make a successful landing as spray kicks up off the surface and high winds continue to batter the runway.

Aircraft enthusiast Flugsnug, who posted the video on Saturday, says the plane is a Flybe Embraer 175 which had flown from Belfast on January 28. 

A Flybe spokesman said its pilots are highly trained in flying in poor weather and that taking off and landing safely in such conditions was 'all in a day's work'. 

The video includes a second dramatic landing attempt when another passenger jet adopts a similar technique on its approach.

On this occasion, the aircraft, which Flugsnug says is a Turkish Airlines jet, comes close to touching down before abandoning the landing and going around again, bringing up its wheels.

Flugsnug suggests Birmingham Airport 'seems to have some very unsual wind effects in the last couple of miles of the approach'.

The YouTube user also suggested Birmingham Airport, which last year handled nearly 10million passengers, has a 'reputation' for 'turbulent approaches'.

But an airport spokesman told the Indpendent: 'As with all UK airports, Birmingham Airport experiences challenging weather conditions occasionally, but aircraft remain able to land safely without incident.'

A Flybe spokesman said: 'Aviation is one of the safest forms of public transport in the world. 

'Flybe aircraft are built, certified and operated to the highest standards and as such are capable of flying during the poorer weather conditions experienced during the winter months throughout the UK.

'Flybe pilots are highly trained and have the necessary skills to enable them to operate safely, in conjunction with the aircraft’s stringent specifications, in such adverse weather conditions.

Captain Chris Coney-Jones, Flybe’s General Manager Fleets, added: 'The safety of our passengers and crew are our obvious number one priority. 

'Taking off and landing in strong and gusty winds is all in a day’s work. Professional pilots have the skills, training and necessary procedures required to assess and make the required operational decisions to conduct a safe flight.'

MailOnline has contacted Turkish Airlines for a comment.
