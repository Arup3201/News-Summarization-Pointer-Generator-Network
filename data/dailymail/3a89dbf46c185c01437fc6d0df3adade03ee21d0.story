During January and February, a geomagnetic storm hit parts of the UK and treated residents to a rare and extremely beautiful Aurora Borealis light display.

A photographer from Scotland took to the hills and lakes of Caithness to capture more than 2,000 pictures of this event - usually only seen in more northern regions - and created a stunning time-lapse video being hailed as evidence of the best Northern Lights display the UK has seen for over 12 years.

Polish photographer Maciej Winiarcyzk spent days putting together the video, which he says was the highest point in this solar maximum cycle.

This time-lapse video of the Northern Lights as they travelled over Scotland in February, video grab pictured, was created using more than 2,000 pictures. It is being hailed as evidence of the best Northern Lights display the UK has seen for more than 12 years

There are two types of Aurora - Aurora Borealis, which means ‘dawn of the north’, and Aurora Australis’, known as ‘dawn of the south.’

They
 are caused when electrically charged particles from the sun enter 
the Earth’s atmosphere. These so-called geomagnetic storms occur when a 
solar wind or cloud of magnetic field hits the Earth’s magnetic field. 

Usually
 the charged particles from the sun are deflected by the Earth’s 
magnetic field, but some do manage to enter the atmosphere and collide 
with gas particles. These collisions emit light. 

As a result, Aurora is most common around the magnetic poles and is most often seen in areas with little light pollution.

Over the course of January and 
February, this geomagnetic storm and shock wave from the solar wind was 
so strong and significant, it travelled further south over the UK and 
could be seen in areas with little cloud cover. 

Auroral
 displays appear in many colours although pale green and pink are the 
most common. Shades of red, yellow, green, blue, and violet have also been 
reported.

The 
common, greenish-yellow colour is caused by colliding oxygen molecules 
approximately 60 miles (96km) above Earth. Rare, red auroras are produced 
by oxygen molecules situated much higher up, at around 200 miles (321km). 

Nitrogen produces blue or purplish-red aurora.

A cycle is 11 years of the of the sun's 
activity, which creates the dancing colours that were observed by lucky Britons as far south as Essex a fortnight ago.

Winiarcyzk said: 'It was for sure the best light show in this solar cycle, even this millennium. I've never seen anything quite as spectacular.

'Due to the fact there is less light pollution in Scotland, the breathtaking sight could be witnessed in all its glory.'

Winiarcyzk focused on landmarks, cliffs and castles in Caithness while tracking the wild night sky overhead.

The 41-year-old astronomy enthusiast only took up photography two years ago, after years of putting his passion to one side.

Since then he has quickly become one of the country's highest regarded time-lapse photographers.

While these shots were taken in the Sinclair's Bay area of Caithness, Winiarcyzk has also photographed other locations in Scotland, including 4,000 year-old tombs near Camster, Loch More and Newton Forest.

Winiarcyzk said:
 'I came to Caithness because of a job. I had no idea the area would be a
 place where I could witness such events. It is the perfect place and 
has allowed me to revive my hobby.

'The
 main theme of the video is to show the beauty of the night sky and 
remind people what they are missing by staying at home and watching TV.

'I
 wanted to squeeze in as many aurora shots as possible as these are 
often colourful displays, which appeal to people and grab their 
attention.'

Ken Kennedy, director of the Aurora 
section of the British Astronomical Association (BAA), added: 'Maciej's 
video is of such great quality it can be scientifically analysed and 
will be used as evidence to show the peak of this solar maximum cycle.

'There is normally one peak to a 
solar cycle, where we see the strongest aurora. We believed it to be in 
2008 however the display witnessed a fortnight ago was stronger leading 
us to believe this cycle had two peaks and is now in decline. 

'In
 the video you can see rare sub storms, which is a sudden connection of 
the sun and the earth's magnetic fields which allow the charged 
particles to flow to the polar regions.'
