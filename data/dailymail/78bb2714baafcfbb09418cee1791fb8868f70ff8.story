Scientists are closer to finding a galactic 'skeleton' that they believe could be lurking inside the fabric of our galaxy.

Discovering these 'bones' could help researchers get a better picture of the Milky Way looks like from the outside.

A US team has already discovered one of the galactic bone while studying a dust cloud nicknamed 'Nessie'.

Nessie was identified in 2013 by the light it absorbed. Radio emissions from molecular gas show that Nessie not a chance projection of material on the sky, but instead a real feature.

Not only is 'Nessie' in the galactic plane, but also it extends much longer than anyone anticipated.

This slender bone of the Milky Way is more than 300 light-years long but only one or two light-years wide. It contains about 100,000 suns' worth of material, and looks more like a cosmic snake.

A study presented at the 225th meeting of the American Astronomical Society shows that Nessie is not alone.

Our Milky Way is a spiral galaxy - a pinwheel-shaped collection of stars, gas and dust.  It has a central bar and two major spiral arms that wrap around its disk (artist's impression pictured)

Catherine Zucker, an undergraduate physics student at the University of Virginia, claims to have found six candidates for galactic bones in a new study. 

'It's a really new field of study,' Ms Zucker told Space.com at the AAS meeting in Seattle.

Our Milky Way is a spiral galaxy - a pinwheel-shaped collection of stars, gas and dust. 

It has a central bar and two major spiral arms that wrap around its disk.

Astronomers have identified a new structure in the Milky Way: a long tendril of dust and gas that they are calling a 'bone.'

Observations, especially at infrared wavelengths of light, have found long skinny features jutting between galaxies' spiral arms. 

These relatively straight structures are much less massive than the curving spiral arms. 

Discovering these 'bones' could help researchers get a better picture of the Milky Way looks like from the outside. 

'What I was trying to do was basically prove that the Nessie filament wasn't some curiosity, wasn't a fluke - that there are other filaments out there similar to Nessie that can trace galactic structure.'

Other spiral galaxies also display internal bones or endoskeletons. Observations, especially at infrared wavelengths of light, have found long skinny features jutting between galaxies' spiral arms.

Ms Zucker explained that there are some initial criteria for a galactic bone. For instance, they must lie mostly parallel to the plane of the galaxy.

They should also to trace the spine of the Scutum-Centaurus Arm, one of the largest arms in the Milky Way. And a bone must also be more than 50 times longer than it is wide.

Ms Zucker's team are currently analysing something dubbed 'Filament 5,' which lies in the Scutum-Centaurus Arm, but on the opposite side of the galaxy Nessie.

Astronomers know that the Milky Way is a spiral galaxy - a pinwheel-shaped collection of stars, gas and dust.

It has a central bar and two major spiral arms that wrap around its disk. Since we view the Milky Way from the inside, its exact structure is difficult to determine.

Scientists say finding these bones could serve as a guide for creating a sketch of the Milky Way' major structural elements.

So far one bone, nicknamed Nessie, has been identified from its light

Now the University of Virginia claims to have found six strong candidates for galactic bones, which may make up the skeleton of the Milky Way
