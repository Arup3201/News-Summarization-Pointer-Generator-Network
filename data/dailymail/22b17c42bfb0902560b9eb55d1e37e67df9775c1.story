Cristiano Ronaldo was far from happy during Real Madrid's defeat by Schalke but he will be able to take solace from the fact opponent Max Meyer was wearing his branded pants.

The Schalke midfielder was pictured wearing CR7-branded underwear during his side's shock 4-3 win at the Santiago Bernabeu. 

Meyer played the full 90 minutes against Ronaldo and Co as his side were eliminated from the Champions League despite their emphatic victory on Tuesday night.

Ronaldo was far from happy with his side's display against the Bundesliga outfit and vowed not to speak to the  media during the final few months of the season.

'I wont talk again until the end of the season,' Ronaldo told reporters. 

Real Madrid's first team players were jeered and the Santiago Bernabeu crowd waved white hankies as they left the pitch - despite their side's progression to the quarter-finals of the Champions League.

Ronaldo will be hoping his side can get back to winning ways against Levante on Sunday as Real Madrid look to close the one-point gap on La Liga leaders Barcelona.
