A 34-year-old married woman has been arrested on charges that she had sex with a 17-year-old boy who attends the same school where she works.

Tonya Harris is accused of engaging in felonious sexual acts with the student at a party last November and providing alcohol to minors.

She works in the cafeteria at Falcon School District 49 in El Paso County, Colorado, but has been placed on administrative leave following her arrest last Thursday.

An investigation into the incident had gone cold due to a lack of leads, until the El Paso Sherriff's Office received new information last week through Safe2Tell, an anonymous hotline for teens. That information lead to Harris' arrest.

Harris, who has been married to a serviceman for 18 years, has been released on a $3,000 bond for sexual assault on a child by one in a position of trust and contributing to the delinquency of a minor, both felonies, according to the sheriff's office.

Falcon School District 49 said in a statement that it was cooperating with the investigation and that Harris had been on administrative leave since the initial investigation.

A special meeting has been scheduled to discuss terminating her employment.
