Brazilian beauty Gisele Bundchen has been revealed as the world's highest-paid model for the seventh year running in a new ranking by Forbes.

The 33-year-old mother-of-two made $42million in the fiscal year ending June 2013 thanks to dozens of lucrative fashion and beauty deals.

She raked in almost six times more than former Victoria's Secret Angel Miranda Kerr, who came second on the list with earnings of $7.2million, and outdid her footballer husband, Tom Brady.

Mr Brady who was the eleventh top-paid athlete in 2012-13 reportedly made around $38million, signing 
bonuses and endorsement deals.

According to Forbes Ms Bundchen's biggest source of income remains her merchandising partnerships, which include a lingerie line and multiple accessory collections.

Despite coming out on top her earnings are actually down from 2011-12 when she stashed $45milion away.

Proving her business prowess, Australian native Ms Kerr gained this year's second spot, up from seventh place last year.

She made headlines in 2007 as one of the Victoria's Secret Angels and now, at 30, she’s expanded 
her portfolio scoring contracts with Quantas, David Jones and Mango.

Despite
 earning $1.3million less than last year Adriana Lima, 32, rose from fourth to third place.

The married mother-of-two netted $6million mainly due to her work with Victoria’s Secret.  She has been working with the lingerie brand for 13 years and is its longest-running Angel.

British supermodel Kate Moss, 39, slipped down two places to number four with earnings of $5.7million - $3.5million less than last year.

Ivan Bart, senior vice president and 
managing director of IMG models, the New York-based modeling agency that
 represents her, explained to Forbes: 'Kate still has enormous 
international presence.

'She’s
 still doing a lot of modeling and business around the world. She’s not 
very ‘in-your-face’ in the U.S., but she’s got a number of English and 
European associations.'

In addition to deals with Versace, Rimmel and Vogue Eyewear, not to mention her longstanding design deal 
with TopShop, she is set to pose nude for Playboy to celebrate her 40th birthday.

Rounding off the top five is Liu Wen.

'There's been a shift in the industry 
where models are finding ways to expand their brands and 
partnerships. It’s a smart business model'

The 25-year-old became the first Chinese model to walk in the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show in 2009 and she is the first Asian ever to appear in Forbes' top ten list.

She has gone on to score a roster of 
deals with brands including H&M, Estee Lauder, Calvin Klein and Hugo
 Boss and racked up $4.3million from 2012-13.

Another to make a splash is American model Hilary Rhoda.

The
 26-year-old, best known for her work with Estee Lauder and her 
appearances in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue came in at number 
five with an estimated salary of $4million.

Model and actress Carolyn Murphy, 38, jumped up from ninth to seventh place with slightly higher earnings of $3.6million.

Last July she was hired as the host of Project Runway: All Stars and this year landed contracts with Coach, Ann Taylor Loft and Carlo Pazolini.

Ms Murphy was followed by up-and-comer, Joan Smalls - another newcomer to Forbes' list.

The 25-year-old Puerto Rican was named the world's number one model on models.com in September 2012 and this year earned a cool $3.5million.

Coming up close behind at ninth place is her friend and fellow Victoria's Secret model, Candice Swanepoel.

The blonde South African made $3.3million this year - $200,000 more than last year - seeing her move up one spot.

Lara
 Stone, who has been keeping a relatively low profile since the birth of
 her first child this May, fell down two spots to number ten with 
$3.2million.

Overall, six out of the ten top earning 
models on Forbes' list have worked for the lingerie brand Victoria's Secret.

Ed Razek, chief marketing officer 
of Limited Brands, the label's parent company, explained how 
his supermodels become such successful business women.

'Our
 contracts are based on the way senior business leaders are paid, which 
is on incentive compensation,' he said.

'So it’s in the best interest of our 
business, and in the best interest of these models to perform at the 
highest level possible that they possibly can.'

He added that there has also been a 'sudden shift in the industry 
where models are all finding ways to expand their brands and 
partnerships. It’s a smart business model for them.'

Diversifying into fashion design and television, Heidi Klum was not counted on the model rich list.

According to Forbes the mother-of-four earned $20million in 2011, the most recent year figures are available, thanks to her business ventures.
