A Muslim man has been charged with assault after he attacked his own sister and her lesbian partner with a crowbar.

Ahmed Mohammed Tuma, 20, was arrested on November 8 after he allegedly beat his 22-year-old sister and her fiancée along with accomplice Nathan Marks.

Tuma has also been charged with terrorism and hate crime charges in Lincoln, Nebraska.

Marks faces charges of aiding and abetting terroristic threats and aiding and abetting the use of a weapon to commit a felony.

Tuma reportedly turned up at his sister's home in Lincoln last week armed with a crowbar. 

The victim, who did not want her or her partner identified, told opposingviews.com: 'At first I didn't know who it was.

'Then I finally realized it was my brother... he had a crowbar in his hand, he tried to hit me with it.'

The two women managed to escape their attackers and get into their car. The men then hit the car with the bar and tried to push them into oncoming traffic.

It is believed that Tuma assaulted his sister because he feels her relationship is a 'disgrace' to their Muslim family.

Both Tuma and Marks are being held in police custody.
