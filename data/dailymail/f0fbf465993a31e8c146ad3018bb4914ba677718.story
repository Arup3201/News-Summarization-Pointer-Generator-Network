After Mario Balotelli scored two stunning goals in the semi-final of the 2012 European Championships against Germany, a member of staff at his club Manchester City offered a startlingly frank opinion.

'Don’t worry,' he said, 'He will still be useless when he comes back to us. He just hasn’t got it.'

Two summers – and a change of club – later, question remarks remain.

Bench life: But things never really worked out for Balotelli at Manchester City

Balotelli is an AC Milan player now 
and sixteen goals last season was reasonable. Already in this World Cup 
he has made a telling contribution with his winning goal against England
 in Manaus on Saturday.

The
 23-year-old also picked up fourteen yellow cards and one red last 
season, though, and the general view in Italy is that his all-round 
contribution over the course of a campaign that saw his team finish 
eighth in Serie A was modest.

Here
 in Brazil, opportunity beckons once again for Balotelli to further his 
quest to be taken seriously. Against England he delivered but whether he
 can repeat that performance against Costa Rica here today (FRI) remains
 to be seen.

There is a 
theory in Italy - as there was at City - that Balotelli simply cannot 
get his blood up for the smaller games, something that certainly 
appeared to be the case in Poland and Ukraine two years ago.

In
 Euro 2012, we all remember his contribution against the Germans and his
 penalty in the quarter-final shoot-out against England. Less notable, 
though, were some rather anonymous performances in the group stage.

Trust: Cesare Prandelli manages to get the best out of the enigmatic forward

On Thursday Italian coach Cesare Prandelli said: 'If look at our four years with 
Mario there were times when he was our weapon, the asset, the man who 
would take us to the moon.

'Then, after two months, he wasn’t performing. Many people thought he would not even make it to the World Cup.

'If he is focused for 90 minutes, great. Otherwise we have someone just as good and fresh. He must give 100 per cent.'

As
 he hinted, Prandelli has had his own issues with Balotelli in
 the past. A coach who does not believe in indulging players he told 
Balotelli on his return to Serie A that he must improve his behaviour on
 and off the field if he was to have a future under him for Italy.

Certainly
 Balotelli plays for his country largely because of a lack of viable 
alternatives. There is a dearth of genuine world class centre forwards 
in Italy. The days of Alessandri del Piero and Christian Vieri are long 
gone.

Many in Italy still view Balotelli as a side show.

A
 paternity dispute with ex-girlfriend Raffaella Fico only ended when a 
DNA test that showed positive in February while an immaturity that 
ultimately proved too much even for his father figure Roberto Mancini at
 City bubbled to the surface during a remarkable TV interview after a 
defeat to Roma in April.

Asked
 by pundit Giancarlo Marocchi - a former Italian midfielder – why he 
hadn’ t tried harder, Balotelli said: 'You don’t know anything about 
football. You always talk about me.

'When Milan win Mario is great but when Milan lose it’s always Mario’s fault. I don’t need your criticism. I criticise myself.

'You always expect me to score five goals in a game.'

Balotelli terminated the live post-match interview by throwing down the microphone and walking off.

In
 terms of his future, it is far from certain that he will remain at 
Milan. Linked with Arsenal, his flamboyant agent Mino Raiola has refused
 to rule out a move.

At 
City, the view was always that Balotelli would never prosper unless he 
was encouraged to feel that he was the only player who really mattered. 
With Italy, he certainly seems to respond to the fact that Prandelli 
plays him as his only central striker.

Balotelli said: 'I hope it’s not Mario’s World Cup but Italy’s. 'I hope to give a good contribution to team but I’m not interested in being the great star. I want our team to win.'

A
 game against Costa Rica may not get the juices flowing in quite the 
same way as the England clash did. Another stand-out show on Friday night, 
though, would go some way to answering pertinent questions.

Meanwhile,
 goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon returns to the team today having recovered 
from an ankle injury and having opened up with his battle against 
depression for the first time.

The Italian legend has revealed that he suffered with the illness in private for years before finally asking for help.

Ready to do the business: Balotelli can fire Italy into the next round with victory against Costa Rica on Friday

'I didn't know if I could talk about it to anyone,' he told 4-4-2 magazine.

'But then, very gradually, I would chat about it to friends, to team-mates, people really close to me.

'I began to understand I had a problem and that it was something that could be dealt with, that could be cured.

'I
 didn't take a break because I felt this great responsibility to my 
team-mates and to people who relied on me. I didn't want to let them 
down.

'I didn't feel like I could stop playing, not with that responsibility.

'It helped to see a psychologist but, as I said, the support of friends and team-mates was a big thing for me.'
