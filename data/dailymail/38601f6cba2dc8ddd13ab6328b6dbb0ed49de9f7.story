Caroline Wozniacki has proved there's no rest for the wicked as she gets set for her marathon debut in New York on Sunday.

The 24-year-old only recently competed in the WTA finals, the last tournament of her competitive tennis season, losing out in the semi-finals to Serena Williams in a three-set thriller.

However, the former World No 1 hatched the plan to run the 26.2 marathon shortly before competing in Wimbledon earlier this year.

Wozniacki, whose longest run stands out 13 miles so far, arrived in Manhattan on Wednesday to receive her New York City Marathon race bib and when speaking to reporters admitted she is anxious ahead of the race.

'I'm a little nervous. This is the farthest I'm going to run,' said Wozniacki.

'I think it's going to be an unbelievable experience. The New York City Marathon has always been on my bucket list.'

Wozniacki, who has raised more than £30,000 for the Team for Kids charity in the build-up to the event, revealed people close to her felt she was mad to participate in the event, in a period where she normally rests for three weeks.

She added: 'I was like: you know what? I'm going to run it.

'They were like, 'No way, you're not. You're crazy.' Right then and there, I called my manager. I was like, 'Can you look up charities I can run for at the New York City Marathon?'

'He was like, 'You've got to be kidding.' And I'm like, 'No, I'm actually serious.'
