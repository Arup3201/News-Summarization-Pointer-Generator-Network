Stabbed to death: Dennis Lane, pictured, was found stabbed to death in his home on Friday morning

A 14-year-old special needs student is accused of coaxing her 19-year-old boyfriend into stabbing to death her father in a bloody attack they plotted for months over Facebook and Skype.

Morgan Lane Arnold and Jason Anthony Bulmer, of Ellicott City, Maryland, also allegedly planned to kill Dennis Lane's fiance, Denise Geiger, but didn't get the chance as she called 911 when she heard her partner's blood-curdling screams.

The teens were arrested on Friday morning and have been charged with first and second-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder.

Officers discovered Lane, 58, dead in an upstairs bedroom at around 4:30 a.m. on Friday and the two suspects were discovered in a nearby room with Bulmer drenched in blood.

According to charging documents, Bulmer had been instructed by 14-year-old Arnold to stab Lane in the throat 10 times with a kitchen carving knife and Geiger in the throat 15 times with the same weapon.

When detectives asked why Geiger was to be stabbed five times more than Lane, Bulmer, who is only in the 10th grade, told detectives that Arnold said: 'I have my reasons, and I'll tell you later.'

The pair were then planning to flee to California, police said.

According to police, the teenage couple plotted the murder for months over 'electronic communication.'

'I don't know what I'll do if you don't do it tonight,' Arnold told Bulmer in one of their last exchanges, according to CBS.

Bulmer was instructed to bring his own knife to the house, which Arnold shared with her dad and Geiger, and he sent his younger girlfriend a photo of a kitchen knife in a text message, checking for her approval.

She replied in such a way that 'indicated to Bulmer that this knife was satisfactory,' according to the charging documents. She sent a further message to say she would leave the door unlocked and Bulmer let her know when he had left his home in Ellicott City and was en route to her father's house.

When he arrived, at around 4 a.m. Bulmer allegedly crept into the home then into Lane's bedroom
where he stabbed him multiple times, leaving him in a pool of his own blood.

'We do believe this homicide was very much encouraged by this fourteen-year-old daughter,' a police spokesman said.

'Both Bulmer, who had blood on his hands and clothes, and Arnold were sitting in an upstairs bedroom when the police arrived. Officers found Lane deceased with multiple stab wounds in a different upstairs bedroom.'

Both
teens are active on Facebook and on their pages, which are plastered 
with dedications of their love for one other, they discuss communicating
over Skype.

Investigators haven't pinned down a motive for the horrific act but they believe Arnold
urged Bulmer to stab her father, a prominent blogger in Howard County 
and a real estate exec, so the two could run away together.

Morgan
Arnold's mother, Cindi Arnold, who lives in Catonsville, Maryland, told the  The Baltimore Sun that her daughter has 
special needs and that she would comment on the charges when the time 
was right.

Serious allegations: Arnold and Bulmer, pictured, are charged them with first and second-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder

'I
will make a public statement soon when I determine it is in the best 
interest of my very fragile special-needs child and her alleged role in 
this devastating situation,' Cindi Arnold told the newspaper.

Arnold,
who has been charged as an adult, is scheduled for a preliminary 
hearing May 24, while Bulmer faces a similar proceeding June 7, 
according to court records. Both were held without bail over the weekend before a bail review hearing today.

In early December, Arnold wrote a post on her Facebook page warning her friends of the apocalypse.

'The world shalt end this year!!!' 
the 14-year-old lamented on her page, which is otherwise covered with 
obsessive posts about her boyfriend.

Her mother quickly responded with 'or not' before her father weighed into the conversation minutes later.

'We'll
find out next week if you're right...' he wrote after the post, which 
now seems particularly chilling. She wrote, simply: 'Yay!'

Bulmer's Facebook page was full of love dedications for Arnold and photographs of the two of them, who both attended Mount Hebron High in Ellicott City.

'On April 6, he wrote: 'Cleaning my room now for Morgan tomorrow and I'm hitting the spot on my head where I busted it up at.'

Later that day her added: 'Watching lord or the rings (sic) the fellowship of the ring extended edition with @Morgan Arnold.'

The following day he wrote on his wall: 'Going to my girlfriends 's ms (sic) house then horseback riding today is going to be fun' before changing his profile picture to a photo of the two of them.

On April 11, he posted to his wall: 'Bored as hell right now I can't wait to see Morgan tomorrow I miss you,' then 'What to watch so many Netflix so little time ugh I just can't wait to see Morgan tomorrow.'

Family and friends were shocked by the senseless slaying.

Geiger wrote on her Facebook page yesterday: 'I will ALWAYS LOVE Dennis Lane, aka, WORDBONES. He will always will be in my heart.'

Others described Lane's 
relationship with his daughter as extremely close.

According to the Sun, the father regularly blogged about cherished time spent with the teen.

Lane's sister J Kelly Lane, wrote a tribute to her brother on Facebook on Saturday.

'Dennis.. RIP, sweet bro. You were always there for me, my hero, my joker, my friend,' she wrote.

Later she added: 'The outpouring of love & support at this most difficult time is so appreciated by me & my family. Thanks to you all.'

Condolences also poured in from followers of Lane's blog 'A Tale of Two Cities' after news of his death surfaced.

A reader called Jill wrote: 'I am so shocked and saddened. I tuned in every day to see what perspectives of business and community, or just plain beauty, Dennis was going to share with us on that day.'

Another follower, Christine Carey, said in a comment: 'Thank you for sharing your dreams and thoughts about Columbia and Ellicott City. There's so much that I know about where I live that came directly from your blog and I can't thank you enough.'

Counselors were on hand today at Mount Hebron High for students who will likely be shocked by the charges filed against their classmates.

School district spokesman Rebecca Amani-Dove said in an email to the Sun: 'Our thoughts and prayers are with the victim's family and everyone affected by this terrible tragedy.'
