Police are investigating the desecration of more than 60 historic gravestones at Bathurst Cemetery, after an act of vandalism locals have labelled 'atrocious' and 'disgusting'.

The headstones belonging to the early residents of the regional NSW town were found smashed into pieces on Wednesday.

Local volunteer groups said they were disappointed by the destruction as they were almost finished restoring the old graves, which date back as far as 1846, in time for the Bathurst bicentenary celebrations next year.

Barry Konemann from the Bathurst Family History Group discovered 67 damaged graves at Bathurst Cemetary on Wednesday morning

Bathurst Family History Group member secretary Barry Konemann discovered the damaged graves at 8.45am yesterday.

Mr Konemann said the vandals targeted historic graves in Christian sections of the cemetery, with 42 Catholic headstones and 25 Church of England headstones damaged.

'It's significant that they're only in the older part of the cemetery,' Mr Konemann told MailOnline.

Bathurst District Historical Society president Alan McRae said he was sickened by the 'wanton destruction'.

'It's not just a walk through and push a couple of things over there's too much damage for that,' Mr McRae said.

'Some of the headstones are in three and four and five and six pieces.'

Mr McRae said he thought the attack was deliberate and was carried out by two or more people.

'I just don't see any point, there's one grave there I noticed that was a three-year-old boy's grave,' he said.

'They didn't read they just smashed.

'They're not just the history there the resting places of early residents and any grave site should be respected no matter what religion or whatever it is.'

Mr Konemann said he didn't think any of the graves destroyed belonged to historical figures, but he said the headstones dated back to the 1800s.

'It just seems to me that they've taken all the old ones but for what reason I've got no idea,' he said.

He added that the vandalised spots were well spread out and on diagonally opposite parts of the cemetery.

Local volunteer groups said they were disappointed by the destruction as they were almost finished restoring the old graves, which date back as far as 1846

'From where the damage occurred in the Catholic section to where damage started in the Church of England section would be 100 yards,' he said.

Mr Konemann said it looked like the headstones were pushed over, which caused them to shatter.

He added people with family members in the cemetery had called him since hearing about the vandalism, but so far he hasn't spoken to anyone whose family members' graves had been affected.

Mr Konemann, along with other members of Bathurst Family History Group, had been working for the past two and a half years to restore the old graves in time for the Bathurst bicentenary celebrations in 2015.

One of the graves desecrated belonged to a three-year-old boy

'We've restored very many headstones over that time and we were getting towards the end of it but not anymore,' he said.

Mr Konemann said the damage occurred sometime between 3pm on Friday when he last visited the cemetery and 8.45am Wednesday morning.

Locals have expressed their outrage on Facebook, labelling the crime disrespectful.

'So hard to believe anyone could such a disgusting thing. May all these people you done this to haunt you till the day you die. Scum bags,' Mary Board wrote on the Chifley Police Facebook page.

Meanwhile Ash Reed posted: 'Putrid scum! How this idea even pops into one's head amazes me. The hurt this has caused to so many families!'

Police are investigating the crime and are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.
