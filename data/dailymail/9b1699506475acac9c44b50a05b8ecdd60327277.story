We've already seen battles over milk prices – now supermarkets are slashing the cost of chickens in their fierce fight to win customers.

Waitrose has halved the price of its 1.3kg ‘Essentials’ chicken from £4.23 to just £2.11 in the last few days – making it even cheaper than budget brands Aldi and Lidl, who are selling 1.25kg birds for £2.99.

Tesco and Asda are running promotions where three of their £4 chickens (weighing 1.35kg each) can be bought for £10 – the equivalent of £3.33 a bird.

Sainsbury’s has permanently cut the cost of its 1.35kg chicken by £1 – from £4.50 to £3.50. 

And Marks & Spencer is offering its 1.1kg Oakham chicken, which is normally £4, at two for £7.

Shoppers will undoubtedly welcome the discounts – but critics are warning that poultry welfare could suffer as a result, and some farmers may be forced out of business.

They are already being squeezed on milk prices as supermarkets compete to offer the cheapest deals, with more than 1,000 dairy farms told this week that their payments are being delayed due to a financial crisis at the biggest dairy co-operative, First Milk.

Poultry farmers now fear a crash in profits, too, as supermarkets turn their attention to chicken in a bid to entice shoppers through their doors. 

Chicken is Britain’s biggest-selling meat, with around 800million birds reared each year for our tables. And, as it’s a staple food for most households, consumers watch its price more carefully than they do for most goods.

It may also be that retailers are trying to reverse a decline in the sale of chicken, following fears about its safety last autumn. 

The Food Standards Agency revealed then that 70 per cent of whole raw chickens sold by the leading chains were contaminated with the potentially deadly food- poisoning bug campylobacter.

Almost one in five of fresh roasting chickens – 18 per cent – were contaminated with the highest levels of the bug. 

And more than one in 20 carried the germ on the outside of the pack, meaning people picking them up from the shelf to check a price could fall ill.

The latest figures by retail analysis firm Kantar Worldpanel suggest consumers may have reacted to the revelations, with 6.8 per cent less chicken being bought in the 12 weeks to December 7 than during the same period in 2013.

However, Waitrose, which is selling the cheapest chicken, claimed its price cut was part of a wider half-price promotion on meat. And it insisted that its farmers were not skimping on animal-welfare standards or quality as a result of the low price.

‘The hens have 20 per cent more space than the industry standard, giving our birds the room they need to move freely,’ a spokesman said. 

‘Our standards meet the RSPCA’s recommendations and have the support of other key organisations such as Compassion in World Farming.’

Last night the National Farmers Union warned supermarkets against using chicken as a loss leader (a product sold below its market price to entice shoppers into the store).

The union’s chief poultry adviser Gary Ford said: ‘Poultry farmers are not averse to promotional activity. 

'However, selling products as a loss leader must not be at the expense of producers and others in the supply chain. 

'Farmers already face volatile market conditions that make it unpredictable whether they return a profit or not.’

He called for the powers of the supermarket ombudsman to be extended, to eradicate ‘unfair trading practices’.
