A mother has been charged with involuntary manslaughter after shooting her toddler in the head while he slept in his crib.

Holly Pallone, 26, told 911 responders that she had been planning to sell the gun and was unloading it when it fired on Saturday.

Her son Anthony Pallone Jr, 19 months, was found at the home in Slatington, eastern Pennsylvania with a bullet wound to the forehead.

Charges: Holly Pallone, 26, sits in the back of a patrol car after she reportedly shot her 19-month-old son while trying to unload a gun to sell in Slatington, Pennsylvania

The mother called police at 11.15pm on Saturday to tell them that a 'gun had gone off and hit my son in the forehead', according to 69 News.

Anthony was pronounced dead at the scene and the coroner has ruled the death a homicide.

The .44 caliber revolver belonged to the man at whose home Pallone and her son lived. The 26-year-old said she had wanted to sell the gun for $200 to a man she used to buy drugs from, according to court documents.

She told police that she sat on her bed and tried to unload the weapon even though she didn't know what she was doing. The gun fired and a bullet traveled through the mattress and into the baby's crib.

Pallone was arraigned on Sunday morning from Lehigh County prison for involuntary manslaughter along with reckless endangerment.

Coroner Scott Grim scheduled an autopsy for Monday. Court records indicated Pallone will 
be represented by the county public defender's office.

Her bail was set at $1million and she is due back in court on October 15.
