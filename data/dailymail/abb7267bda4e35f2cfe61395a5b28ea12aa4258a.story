The son of a family found murdered in their home has been charged with their murders and is being held without bail.

Alan Hruby, 19, of Norman, Oklahoma, admitted to shooting his father, John Hruby, mother, Katherine 'Tinker' Hruby and younger sister Katherine, most likely on Thursday night. 

Stephens County District Attorney Jason Hicks said in a news conference today that Alan said he owed a loan shark $3,000 and was hoping to inherit the money he needed to pay this person by inheriting money.

Hicks also said that Alan told investigators that after shooting his parents he threw the gun he used, along with a DVD from the home's security system, in a nearby lake.

Tragedy: John and Katherine Hruby and their teenage daughter Katherine (above) were found dead in their Duncan, Oklahoma, home on Monday morning

Vacation: After killing his family, Alan shared this photo on Instagram of his friends, saying the three were staying at The Ritz-Carlton in Dallas, Texas

The young man, who was on parole for creating a credit card in his grandmother's name without her knowledge, then spent the weekend with friends, even sharing a photo on Instagram of himself that claimed he was staying at The Ritz-Carlton in Dallas, Texas.  

He and his friends were there to watch the University of Oklahoma football game against University of Texas.

His family had been dead and undiscovered for two whole days at that point. 

'College wouldn't be half as great with out these two peaches,' wrote Alan on the Instagram pic, sharing a photo of his two friends lounging on the bed. 

The young man also seemed to make a point of saying he was at his dorm at The University of Oklahoma on Thursday night on both his Twitter and Instagram accounts, perhaps as a way to distance himself from the scene of the murder.

Alan's confession was announced earlier today by Duncan Police Chief Danny Ford. 

Prosecutors have said they will be considering the death penalty in this case. 

His next court hearing is scheduled for December 17 and he has been told to have a lawyer by December 2. 

The family's  housekeeper discovered the victims around 9am on Monday and told police she found the three bodies, 'cold and not breathing'.

The medical examiner is performing autopsies and only said that the victims died of 'wounds' but declined to be specific, although family friends say they were shot.

However, he did confirm that no weapon has been recovered from the scene and there was no evidence of forced entry.

Charged: Alan Hruby (above),was on parole after creating a credit card in his grandmother's name without her permission and spending over $4,000

Final resting place: A look at the Hrubys home, where their housekeeper found them

Big purchase: Alan shared this photo last summer of himself at the Eifel Tower in Paris with an Omega watch, around the same time he had started a card in his grandmother's name

Ford told NewsOK that the housekeeper told her daughter of the family deaths, and and she called Alan.

'My understanding is she told him something was wrong at the house and that he needed to come home,' Ford said according to NewsOk.

Hruby then arrived at the house on Monday morning and broke down in hysterics when told by police his family had been killed.

Ford said that Hruby was hyperventilating, crying and wailing and that he had to spend time with the station chaplain.

He was then interviewed by investigators with the district attorney present as they tried to work out his whereabouts over the weekend and when he last saw his family alive.

Foodie: Even at his college dorm Alan liked to portray himself as someone with a taste for the finer things 

Ford told NewsOk that the last sighting of Katherine, a junior at Duncan High School, was on Thursday and she was not in classes on Friday.

Duncan police took Alan in for questioning after he returned home and also removed his SUV from the scene while he was taken to the station.

All three other SUV's belonging to the victims were left parked outside their home.

And on Tuesday a Stephens County District Court signed off on a probable cause affidavit for Alan for knowingly concealing stolen property.

The young man seems to have a penchant for the finer things in life, sharing pictures on Instagram of Louis Vuitton wallets and Omega watches, things he seems to have purchased at the same time he had started a credit card in hius grandmother's name and racked up charges of $4,000.

It is also believe he recently stole one of his mother's cards as well, or started one in her name without her knowledge.

'It's sad. It's very shocking,' said a 21-year-old neighbor, who asked to remain unnamed, about the deaths. 

'They were a good family. They would always help you out. If your car wouldn't start, they'd come over and jump it, or if your dog ran off they'd try to help you catch it. Just neighborly things.'

People started getting concerned when John, 50, the publisher of the local paper, The Marlow Review, did not turn up for work on Friday morning.

He also failed to cover the weekly high school football game, something he always does according to his employees.

Police have been examining the house since yesterday looking for clues, and were seen carrying what appeared to be a digital video recorder out of the home yesterday afternoon.

They were also examining a jeep parked on the street that neighbors claim belonged to Alan.

'At this time, The Marlow Review asks the general public for prayers following the tragic deaths of John Hruby, our publisher, his wife, Tinker, and their daughter, Katherine,' said John's colleagues in a statement.

'Our staff endeavors to continue to serve Marlow to the best of our ability going forward.'

Meanwhile, friends and classmates of Katherine, 17, a volleyball player, held a vigil for her last night.

'She was such a good person and such good friend to all of us,' said teammate Carly Kirkand.

'She always had a smile on her face even when she had every reason not to. It's going to be hard because she was such a huge part of this team.'

Traveling: The youngster enjoyed trips to Paris, Rome, London and New York City is just the past year

Friends: 'They were a good family. They would always help you out. If your car wouldn't start, they'd come over and jump it, or if your dog ran off they'd try to help you catch it,' said a neighbor of Tinker (above) and her family

Police are examining Alan Hruby's checkered criminal history, which includes a guilty sentence for credit card fraud and revealed that he is due in court again on November 12 for a parole violation.

In a police affidavit filed in August, 2013 officers met with John Hruby after he suspected his son, Alan, was using a credit card not belonging to him.

According to KFOR, authorities say they found several charges to the card from Europe, during the time Alan took a trip to Paris.

He had previously ran afoul of the law earlier this year when he pleaded guilty to a charge of credit card theft.

The credit card he stole belonged to his grandmother, Janice Hruby, according to a family friend.

His father phoned the police and he pleaded guilty in January of this year and he was entered into a delayed sentencing program and was due to appear in court this November.

As part of his punishment the court ordered him to pay restitution, undergo a substance abuse evaluation, attend drug and alcohol counseling and complete a cognitive behavior program.
