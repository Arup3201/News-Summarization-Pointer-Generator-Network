A mother and son have had their electronic tags removed so they can celebrate Christmas and New Year's Eve despite being convicted of a festive burglary.

A mother and son convicted of burgling a house during the festive period have been told they can remove their curfew tags so they can celebrate Christmas and New Year's Eve.

Magistrates sparked outrage by telling Julie Crowe, 40, and son Jack, 18, just days before Christmas Day that they were free to enjoy the festive season with their family in Gillingham, Kent.

The pair successfully applied for the resections to be lifted until January 2, angering law-abiding members of the public.

Curfew: Magistrates told a mother and son they could remove their tags so they can celebrate the festivities

The mother and son were sentenced in September for stealing £250 worth of duvets, ornaments and vases from a show home in Kempston, Bedfordshire, three days after Christmas last year.

Julie Crowe was also guilty of making fake charity buckets and given a community order and four month curfew restricting her to her Kempston home between 7pm and 7am daily. Jack Crowe is serving six month on a tag.

A reader of a local newspaper's website Bedfordshire-news.co.uk said: 'A bad call by the magistrates. Maybe if the lovely Miss Crowe and her wonderful son missed the family knees-up in Gillingham, they would think a bit harder about ripping off charitable folk and stealing property?'

Chair of the bench at  at Bedford Magistrates Court, Sandra Reynolds, said: 'Because of your good compliance with your sentence we are going to grant this application. We are not extending the curfew length so you both get a lot of time off.'

The court heard Julie Crowe was prepared to have the days off added to her sentence, but her son could not because he is serving the maximum sentence on tag.

Jane Anderson, defending, said: 'Miss Crowe doesn't want it to appear she's getting away from her punishment by visiting her family and she has offered for her curfew to be extended.'

Electronic tags are attached to criminals who are spared jail or released from prison earlier. They fit onto their legs and allow the authorities to monitor their whereabouts through GPS technology - with their location usually sent to a control room through a mobile phone network.

Last year blundering staff at private security firm G4S attached a tag to the false leg of Christopher Lowcock, from Rochdale.

The 29-year-old was given the curfew for driving, drug and weapons offences but was able to dodge the restriction by detaching his prosthetic limb.

In 2008, heroin dealer Aaron Morgan, 22, from Devon, was let off the last two months of his curfew when Judge Graham Cottle ruled the tag 'did not look fashionable with shorts', and earlier this year Beverley Douglas was spared a tag because it did not fit around her chubby ankles.

Tags also failed to stop Rikki Johnson breaking his curfew and stabbing 18-year-old Lewis Singleton to death in 2008 or disgraced property tycoon Shaid Luqman, 42, fleeing the country in 2010.

Earlier this year MP Eric Joyce, who was given a curfew following a Westminster punch-up, admitted cutting his tag off to compete in the annual boat race between the House of Common and the House of Lords.

Figures show tagging costs the country £100 million a year, with 64,420 people tagged in 2010-11.

But more than 1,000 violent crimes have been committed by offenders released from jail early with a tag, while 2,000 a year are ripping off their tags.
