While his friends get on with being children, this Chinese boy must endure hours of gruelling training to become the best backflipper in the world.

Long Dihao, from Dazu in Chongquig municipality, is only seven, but can already complete more than 40 back flips 
within 30 seconds.

The little boy is incredibly supple thanks to hours of balancing in the splits position across two crash mats.

He also spends a lot of time upside down in a headstand and balancing on a beam

Such training gives him a mighty appetite, but Long keeps it healthy with simple noodle soup.

Long's fellow countryman Ziyi Zhang 
currently holds the Guinness World Record for most standing back 
somersaults in one minute after achieving 36 in 2010.

Last month 16-year-old 
American cheerleader Miranda Ferguson beat the handspring world record with her feat of 35 simultaneous moving back flips.
