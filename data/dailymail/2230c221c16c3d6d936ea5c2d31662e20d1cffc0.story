It may be 47 days away, but online shopping giants Amazon are already getting ready for Christmas by employing thousands of seasonal workers in their enormous warehouses.

The temporary recruits have been brought in to prepare for Cyber Monday, the day where millions of British shoppers are expected to flock online and purchase hundreds of products every minute in time for the festive season.

One enormous storage facility in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, will process a huge number of yuletide gifts in the next month while another in Swansea, South Wales, will package and ship hundreds of presents ranging from dog biscuits to the new PlayStation 4 every second.

Gearing up for Christmas: The enormous Amazon warehouse in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, is already starting to fill up with thousands of boxes in preparation for the festive season

Organised: Toys and gadgets are placed in the 'sortable' areas which are divided up by cardboard screens scattered across the floor

The hub: Employees frantically type away at their computers as trollies of gifts are dragged around by employees

Items are placed on a conveyor belt around the clock and sent down the enormous warehouses to waiting delivery trucks which leave every 130 seconds.

Last year on Cyber Monday, Amazon received orders for more than 3.5 million items - a rate of around 44 items per second.

At the online shopping giant's Swansea Fulfilment Centre, where 1,500 extra employees are being taken on over the festive season, the 35-year-old general manager announced: 'We're ready for Cyber Monday...bring it on!'

As toys and other gifts whizzed overhead in the centre's cavernous 'sortables' area, she added that the number of part-time associates taken on this Christmas was the biggest ever.

She said: 'We'll wait to see if Cyber Monday - always the first Monday in December - proves to be the busiest yet, but here in Swansea we are definitely prepared if it turns out that way.'

Time consuming: Staff have to scan every individual item which goes through the massive storage area so their progress through the delivery process can be monitored

System: An letter and number code is used to distinguish the thousands of rows of gifts which employees have to sort through

Prepared: Hundreds of yellow containers are stacked up in front of the seemingly endless collection of goods, ready to move the items so they can be shipped to thousands of addresses across the UK

The 700,000 sq ft centre in South Wales was opened in 2008 and employee numbers have been growing ever since with, 2,000-plus staff now working on the site.

In the UK Amazon fulfilment centres, staff including 'pickers' and 'sorters' work four 10-hour shifts a week which means employees now benefit from three days off.

Company spokesman Fran Waite added:
 'Fewer visits to work are also likely to save associates both time and 
money on a weekly basis and could reduce the impact on the environment 
due to less commuting.'

At 
the Jersey Marine Amazon warehouse yesterday - the size of 10 football 
pitches - a team of workers in an area known as 'wrapland' were 
attaching shiny gold and red paper to items which customers asked
 to be gift wrapped.

Packaging: The loading area in the centre of the warehouse sees employees sorting the purchased items. Around 50 per cent more staff have been hired to cover the busy Christmas period

Storage: Stacks of nappies are separated by cardboard dividers which are set to make the routine more efficient

Busy: Some of the thousands of seasonal workers taken on by the online shopping giants this year navigate their trollies around the warehouse while a woman folds up cardboard boxes ready for presents to be packaged and posted

Clockwork: The computer 'brain' tracks every item as it makes it way from the lorry to the shelves before it is put into the boxes

Ready: A worker packs up a Nintendo Wii console next to a stack of flyers

Keeping track: A woman scans a DVD while nestled in between a set of shelves which are organised by an extensive system of yellow dividers

Miss Waite said: 'A lot is done by computer but some things are done better by hand.'

The Amazon fulfilment centre workers have a non-stop regime which involves receiving items from suppliers at its lorry dock.

These are then scanned so the building's computer 'brain' knows the stock before they are placed on conveyor belts and taken to a storage house where millions of items from surfboards to toys and kettles to motorcycle parts are kept.

When an item is ordered staff are guided to it by the shortest route using a satnav and after wrapping it is sent by lorry to its new owner.

Searching: An employee looks for an item in the shelves during his hectic daily routine which starts with workers receiving items from suppliers at its lorry dock

Process: A male employee scans a copy of Delia Smith's Christmas. It is then transferred to a conveyor belt which moves the item down the warehouse so it can be prepared for delivery

Ready: Another worker moves yellow boxes in preparation for December 2nd, which Amazon says will be the busiest shopping day of the year
