They're a long way off.

But expecting mom Ashley Gardner has given her not-yet-born quadruplets a costume of their own this Halloween.

Celebrating the miracle surgery that saved all four children last week, she excitedly got into the festive mood by wearing a skeleton outfit - with four little skeleton characters printed on her ballooning pregnant belly.

It came just days after Ashley and her husband Tyson were hauled into the hospital for emergency surgery to save the four girls.

'Happy halloween everyone!!!' Ashley wrote on Facebook, giving a 21-week update on her pregnancy.

'Doctor appointment went GREAT! All 4 girls are looking wonderful! They will continue to monitor weekly! But for now I just need to keep doing what I'm doing!' 

Last Monday, it emerged that one set of twins had contracted twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) - a condition which affects identical twins, causing an unequal flow of blood between the twins. 

In an operation that experts branded 'miraculous', all four were saved.

Ashley and Tyson Gardner captured the nation's emotions with their news that she was pregnant with quadruplets after spending eight years trying to conceive - a one in 70 million chance.

Fears: They were rushed to Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital on Monday when doctors saw that one set of twins could be losing blood and Ashley appeared to be approaching labor at just 19 weeks of pregnancy

The couple was flown to a specialist center at Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital, where Ashley was admitted for surgery last Tuesday.

On Thursday, after hours of surgery, the couple revealed on Facebook that doctors recorded steady heartbeats for all four of the unborn babies.

They added: 'God is GOOD! Prayers have been answered!! Miracles continue to take place. ALL the babies survived the surgery, they heard 4 heartbeats today! We want to thank all of you for being part of our miracle!! We don't know how to say THANK YOU enough!! xoxo'  

'We haven't slept much the past few days,' Tyson told ABC News.

He said doctors told his wife she needed immediate surgery after it appeared her cervix had started to open and she could be going into early labor.

On Wednesday, doctors performed the emergency surgery to more equally divert blood flow between one set of the Gardner twins.

'Today, we're doing much better,' he said. 'The last few days have been really rough ... very scary.'

The family posted this message to their Facebook today after the successful surgery 

The couple also found out that Ashley's cervix is opening prematurely as a result of the condition.

Ashley underwent surgery today and was given 'meds to halt any contraction that might occur.'

A few hours later the anxious family revealed the surgery went well.

They posted on Facebook: 'It went great. Dr. Chmait smiled and said, 'This has been a good day!' Our tears have been replaced with relief and continue to pray for the babies safety and continued 'baking' for a good long time!!

Twin to twin transfusion is caused by an abnormal connecting of blood vessels in the twins' shared placenta which results in an imbalance of blood flow from one twin to the other.

It affects approximately 15% of identical twins who share the same placenta. 

One twin is often larger than the other twin and receives more blood than usual from the placenta.

This can put a strain on the baby's heart and makes this twin produce more urine than normal, resulting in extra fluid around the baby, within the amniotic sac.

This can be uncomfortable for the mother and also increases the risk to the pregnancy by causingpremature labour due to the extra pressure on the neck of the womb (cervix).

The other twin is usually smaller and may become anaemic due to receiving less blood from the placenta. 

The treatments for TTTS pregnancies depend, in part, on when in pregnancy the twins become affected. 

If the twins are mature enough to survive outside the womb (beyond 25 weeks), immediate delivery is an option for TTTS babies.

Fetal laser surgery may be done to stop the flow of blood from one twin to the other. 

Another treatment is amnioreduction -  a procedure whereby fluid is taken from around the twin with polyhydramnios to try and prevent premature delivery. A needle is passed through the abdomen into the sac of the recipient twin and fluid removed.

'Ashley will be put on bed rest from here on out.

They then posted: 'The doctor just came out and said the babies are cured of twin to twin transfusion... he said that part couldn't have gone better!!!'

Twin to twin transfusion is caused by an abnormal connecting of blood vessels in the twins' shared placenta which results in an imbalance of blood flow from one twin to the other.

It affects approximately 15% of identical twins who share the same placenta and treatments can include surgery.

The couple hit the headlines a few weeks ago when a video of the moment they found out they were having quadruplets after spending eight years trying to conceive went viral.

They were delighted to learn their first round of IVF was successful in July following a long battle with infertility.

But when they attended their first ultrasound, they were stunned to discover they were expecting four babies - at odds of 70 million to one. 

Their incredible reaction to the news was captured in hospital by their friend, Alicia Hallock, and later uploaded online.

Footage shows the couple gazing open-mouthed at the screen, before Mrs Gardner places her hand on her forehead and breathes out. 

The pair then start laughing in delight, while the mother-to-be holds up scans of her four babies.

Speaking to CNN, Mrs Gardner, who suffers from endometriosis - a condition which sees cells from the lining of the womb grow in other areas of the body - said she was shocked but excited to discover she was pregnant with quadruplets.

'I couldn't think straight. I had never been so excited and terrified in the same instant. We waited so long to have babies so we were so happy,' she said.

'But at that time we literally had never even thought once about this being a possibility. We didn't know anything about having quads and the risks that go with it. But overall, we were just excited.'

She added that her doctor 'didn't believe it' when he learned the news from the ultrasound technician - and asked her to come back the following week so he could 'see for himself'.

Happy: Before getting pregnant, Mrs Gardner said she had spent eight years trying 'everything' to counter the fertility problems caused by her condition, which can also result in intense pain. Above, the Gardners

Before getting pregnant, Mrs Gardner spent eight years trying 'everything' to counter the fertility problems caused by her condition, which can also result in intense pain.

She adopted a specific diet, underwent a laparoscopy, took medication and had four failed rounds of intrauterine insemination, before finally saving up for IVF.

'My endometriosis was so bad that we found during the IVF process that it had compromised my eggs. They all started dying off and left us with one perfect egg and one good egg,' she said.

'They put both back to give me the best odds of one sticking. The chances of even getting one to stick was 40 per cent. To have both stick and both split... well, that's a one-in-70 million chance!'

But despite her joy, Mrs Gardner said she is aware of the risks involved in her pregnancy, writing on Facebook: 'I am extremely high risk and things can change at a moments notice for us.'

Couple: The Gardners recently attended another ultrasound, where they found out they are expecting girls

The Gardners, who live in Pleasant Grove, have documented their extraordinary pregnancy on a Facebook page, 'A Miracle Unfolding - Gardner Quadruplets'.

The page, which has so far gained nearly 60,000 'likes', also features photos of the moment the couple found out their first round of IVF had been successful.

In one image, Mrs Gardner is pictured weeping in her husband's arms as he clings on to her tearfully.  

The couple recently attended another ultrasound, where they found out they are expecting four girls.

The babies - two sets of identical twins - are due to be born by cesarean section in December.
