Mrs Wood wore a white gown with lace and diamante detail, topped with a tara, while her groom sported a smart grey suit. 

Shortly before saying 'I do', Mr Wood expressed his excitement over the couple's big day on his Facebook page.

He wrote: 'So... The next time I post something on here i will be doing so as a married man.... Who'd have thought eh?? Thanks to EVERYONE who has been with me on this journey of life up to now (too many to mention) and thank you to the amazing woman who in just a couple of hours from now will be my wife... Love you babe and thank you.'

Mrs Wood, who changed her name to match her fiancé's before the couple wed, also changed her online status to reflect their marriage, and wrote: 'I love you toi husband xx (sic).'

Rare condition: Mrs Wood has been diagnosed with Othello Syndrome, that causes delusional jealousy

Fear: Mrs Wood set childproof filters on Mr Wood's computer to stop him accessing websites carrying pictures of sexy women

Mr and Mrs Wood made headlines last year after she was diagnosed with a rare condition, Othello Syndrome, that causes delusional jealousy.

She had even banned him from  watching women on television or looking at pictures of them in magazines.

‘I
 think he’s gorgeous, but that’s not the issue - it’s about whether or 
not I can trust him not to look at other women while he is out on his 
own,' she had said.

‘I don’t want him thinking they’re 
hot. If you’re in a relationship and you’re happy with your partner, you
 should only have eyes for that person.’

The couple started dating in 2011 after they met through a friend. Mrs Wood had spent ten years living in the U.S. but moved back to Britain four years ago after another long-term relationship broke down.

Testing times: She bought the lie detector online, saying it was the only way she could be sure Mr Wood's eyes had not been wandering and he was telling the truth

She was so heartbroken 
that she vowed to never get into another relationship - and experts 
believe the emotional trauma triggered her illness.

Mrs Wood was living in her native Scotland when a mutual friend introduced her to Mr Wood on Facebook a year later.

After exchanging messages for several weeks, she travelled to London where the pair enjoyed their first date.

She said: ‘I knew we were meant to be a couple when we shared our first kiss under London Bridge. I didn’t mean to fall in love again after my last relationship but Steve stole my heart.

‘The only problem was that we lived so far apart. We started to get serious and made plans to move in together but I then discovered that Steve had been seeing another girl around the time we’d first met.

‘He claimed he didn’t think we were exclusive because of the distance and I forgave him but I started to doubt whether or not he could be faithful.’

Mrs Wood, who also suffers from bipolar and body dysmorphic disorders, added that her jealousy got worse when the pair moved in together as she tried to monitor Mr Wood’s every move.

She installed child-proof filters on his laptop and mobile phone to stop him looking at explicit pictures of women and banned him from watching any television programmes featuring women, even programmes such as The Weakest Link.

‘One night, an advert 
for a women’s razor came on television and I felt panicky thinking that 
Steve was eyeing the model up,' she said.

Suspicious: Othello, played here by actor Lenny Henry

Othello Syndrome is a psychiatric disorder where a person is convinced their partner is being unfaithful - but with very little, if any, proof to confirm their fears.

The name is derived from Shakespeare’s Othello, who killed his wife Desdemona after suspecting her infidelity. 

The condition presents itself as jealous and controlling behaviour and sometimes violence - but the two main characteristics are delusions and obsessions.

In men the jealousy tends to focus around sexual infidelity, whereas in women it may centre around emotional betrayal.

Treatment includes antidepressant and antipsychotic medication and/or therapy.

It is not known how common the syndrome is but one study suggests the average onset is at age 68 and with 62 per cent of sufferers male.

'The only thing that could put my mind at rest was banning him from watching any programmes that have women in them.

‘Now, I won’t even let him watch The Weakest Link in case he fancies Anne Robinson but I’m scared he’ll have a sneaky look when I’m in another room.

‘That’s why I decided to order the lie detector online. It was my only way of knowing for sure if Steve’s eyes were wandering. In general, he’s quite truthful but I have caught him lying a few times about looking at other women.’

Mrs Wood was diagnosed with Othello Syndrome last September, with the condition affecting her so badly that she could barely leave the house.

She was prescribed anti-anxiety medication and also underwent therapy to deal with her issues, hoping to marry Mr Wood after her treatment.

The name of the condition is derived from
 the play by William Shakespeare, in which the character of Othello 
murders his wife Desdemona after suspecting infidelity.

Research suggests around 15 per cent of 
sufferers have been violent towards their partners, including 
63-year-old Robert Mercati, who killed his wife Margaret at their home 
earlier this year after being diagnosed with the condition.

Mr Mercati, of Bloomsbury, central 
London, who then took his own life, had installed electric bugs around 
the marital home after becoming convinced his wife, also 63, had been 
unfaithful.

Mrs Wood said: ‘My jealousy has driven me to breaking point and sometimes I’ve thrown stuff across the room.

‘I put Steve through a lot but he’s stood by me through it all so I know he’s the man for me. I think lots of women out there must be suffering from the same condition and just not realise it.

‘I think it’s because of the pressure society puts on us to look a certain way - to be stick thin with blonde hair and big boobs. I’m lucky my partner is so understanding - others might not be so fortunate.’

Mr Wood admitted life with his partner could be tough - but insisted she was worth it.

He said: ‘Sometimes, I get nervous and the lie detector test results come back inconclusive because my heart is hammering, which makes Debbi doubt me. I just have to tell her I haven’t cheated and pray she believes me. 

'I’m willing to put up with it, because I know we’re soulmates. She’s so special to me and a bit of jealousy here and there won’t change that.’
