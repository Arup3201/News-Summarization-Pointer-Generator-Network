Attack: Martin Schulz, president of the EU parliament, said that issues such as freedom of migration are 'not up for negotiation'

British plans to crack down on unrestricted immigration within the Europe were attacked last night by the leader of the EU's Parliament.

Despite calls from politicians in the UK - and other European countries - to curb the unrestricted movement of workers between EU countries, senior officials from Brussels have said the principle is 'fundamental' and cannot change.

Martin Schulz, president of the European Parliament, said that while he took plans for EU reform, championed by David Cameron, 'very seriously', some elements were 'not up for negotiation.'

He also poured scorn on the idea that Britain would be able reform its relationship with the EU by threatening to leave - which is what the Conservatives are proposing by promising to offer a referendum on EU membership if they win the next election.

Mr Schulz, a German socialist politician, said that he would like to see Mr Cameron's plans for reform, but made clear that, in his view, some features of the EU cannot be changed.

His claims were almost immediately backed up by Nick Clegg, who today said that freedom of movement was in place 'for very good reasons'.

Speaking to the Observer, he said: 'The principle of free movement of people has been one of the greatest successes the EU has, it is a fundamental principle and it's not up for negotiation any more than renegotiating the principle of the free movement of goods, services or capital.'

He added that any change to the EU of the scale 'needs unanimous support and ratification of all member states'.

Last month it was reported that Home Secretary Theresa May was considering capping EU immigration at 75,000 workers. Though the figure was never confirmed, the Conservative minister did speak out about 'the abuse of free movement in the EU' - which includes fears of benefits tourism.

Mr Schulz also objected the UK pressing for reform 'with one hand on the escape hatch', rather than trying to change things from inside the EU.

The intervention came as Conservative backbencher piled additional pressure on Mr Cameron to give Britain extra powers to resist new laws drafted by Brussels.

A group of 95 MPs sent a letter to the Prime Minister saying the Commons should be allowed to block new EU legislation and repeal measures that threaten the 'national interest'.

Difference of opinion: David Cameron, left, has said he would like to reform the UK's relationship with the EU, while Nick Clegg, right, echoes Mr Schulz's comments in an interview today

According to the Sunday Telegraph, signatories to the letter - drafted by senior MP Bernard Jenkin - include James Clappison, Conor Burns, John Baron, Anne Main and former defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, whose party favours remaining in the EU, today echoed Mr Schulz's comments that freedom of movement was an untouchable feature of membership.

Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, the Liberal Democrat leader he said: 'I think the principle that people can move around the European Union to look for work is a founding principle of the European Union for very good reasons.'

If you want a single market, if you want more jobs to be created... you need to give people the right to look for work.'
