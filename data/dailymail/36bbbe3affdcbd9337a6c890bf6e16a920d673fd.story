Shocked neighbours heard yelling and screaming moments before an 18-year-old woman was abducted from her home by a man who reportedly attacked her with a machete. 

Billy-Anne Huxham, 18, was woken and forcibly taken from a residence in Caboolture, north of Brisbane, just after 6am on Tuesday, the Courier Mail reports. 

Detectives are desperately searching for the teen and Carl Garry Chapman, 32, who is believed to be the victim's former boyfriend.

18-year-old Billy-Anne Huxham was reportedly woken up, attacked with a machete and taken from her home

They were last seen by police together in a Mitsubishi Outlander with registration 789 VNI. 

A neighbour, who didn't want to be identified, said she heard screaming before the Mitsubishi took off down the street.  

'I didn't really think much of it because that sort of thing isn't uncommon for that house,' she said.  

She sustained wounds to her leg and bruising to her face as a result of the violent ambush.

The machete was allegedly left at the scene of the crime but the man is still armed and dangerous and is reportedly carrying a firearm.

Following the abduction, the perpetrator broke into another home in Caboolture and threatened the residents with a gun, believed to be shotgun or rifle.

A police chase on the Bruce Highway was unsuccessful after Mr Chapman and Ms Huxham were spotted driving on Anzac Avenue at 11.30am - five hours after the abduction.

Police are concerned for the woman's safety and urge the public not to approach the pair but to call 000 immediately.
