Any guilty person can expect to face heavy criticism in court from whoever presides over their sentencing.

But one burglar got a surprise today after a judge said the homeowner he encountered during an early hours break-in was right to tell him to ‘f*** off’.

Drug user Lucian Craven, 22, of Tring, Hertfordshire, was jailed for 18 months after committing a string of burglaries in his area last month.

He had been using 'party drugs' - such as cocaine, ecstasy and meow meow - and got into debt, owing £3,000, Tim Nutley, defending, said.

The first incident was on August 3, when he attempted to climb in through the window of a 67-year-old man’s home in Emma Rothschild Court.

But Craven woke the man up, who saw him halfway into the house, the court heard. He managed to run away after the man told him to ‘f*** off.’

Recorder Samantha Leigh told him: ‘You know the effect burglaries have on people - especially when they find people in their own homes.

Then she added, during the sentencing hearing at St Albans Crown Court in Hertfordshire today: ‘This gentleman quite rightly told you to f*** off.’

Three days after the botched attempt, at around midnight on August 6, Craven stole a laptop after getting into a house in Wingrave Road.

The next day he tried to break into a house in Longbridge Close and stole a TV from a house in Sutton Close on the same day.

Craven was caught after his fingerprints were found on a whisky bottle discarded in a garden near the Longbridge Close address.

His fingerprints were also found on the window of the house in Emma Rothschild Court. The TV and laptop were recovered, the court heard.

Craven appeared for sentencing having pleaded guilty before magistrates to two counts of burglary and one of attempted burglary.

The former kitchen porter, who lived in a bedsit on Tring High Street, had no previous convictions for burglary, the court was told.
