Veteran broadcaster and America's leading grumpy old man Andy Rooney delivered his final weekly essay on Sunday after 33 years of appearances on the CBS show 60 Minutes.

He began his weekly show 'A Few Minutes With Andy Rooney' in 1978 at the age of 59 after years working behind the scenes as a writer for TV and radio.

In his 1097th and final essay he described himself not as a 'television personality,' but as 'a writer who reads what he's written.'

He said: 'This is a moment I have dreaded.

'I wish I could do this forever. But I can't. But I'm not retiring. Writers don't retire, and I'll always be a writer.

'A writer's job is to tell the truth. I 
know I've been terribly wrong sometimes, but I think I've been right 
more than I've been wrong.'

Rooney said he has lived a lucky life, luckier than most. But befitting his trademark crotchety nature, he voiced one parting complaint: He doesn't like being famous, nor does he like being bothered by fans.

'I spent my first 50 years trying to become well known as a writer, and the next 30 trying to avoid being famous,' he said. 'I walk down the street now or go to a football game and people shout, "Hey, Andy!" And I hate that.'

So if you see him in a restaurant, Rooney said as he signed off, 'please, just let me eat my dinner.'

CBS News Chairman Jeff Fager paid tribute to his long career saying: 'There's nobody like Andy, and there never will be. He'll hate hearing this, but he's an American original.'

Rooney had been a contributor to 60 Minutes since the show's debut. During its first season in 1968 he appeared a few times in silhouette with Palmer Williams, 60 Minutes senior producer, in a short-lived segment called Ipso and Facto.

He joined CBS in 1949 as a writer for Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts, a hit show of that day and also wrote for The Garry Moore Show (1959-65), a popular variety show.

At the same time, he was writing for CBS News public-affairs broadcasts such as The Twentieth Century and Calendar.

His skills as a writer and producer, not as the talking head he famously became later in life, were the roles he said he always valued most.

'I obviously have a knack for getting 
on paper what a lot of people have thought and didn't realize they 
thought,' he reflected during an interview in 1998. 'And they say, "Hey,
yeah!" And they like that.'

Before
Rooney delivered his final essay, Morley Safer - himself an 89-year-old
journalist and a 60 Minutes staple since 1970 - interviewed Rooney 
about his personal and professional life.

Rooney
admitted that he doesn't sign autographs and rarely responds to fan 
mail, telling Safer he didn't 'want to answer an idiot who would have 
the bad sense to write me a letter.'

Rooney has also engendered controversy, such as his weeks-long suspension in 1990 for remarks that offended some gay viewers.

But he's better known for his sharp commentaries and public persona as someone fed up with everything from desk clutter to chocolate chip cookies to door knobs.

In his time at 60 Minutes, Rooney has also contributed many deeper pieces in the wake of events like the 1986 space shuttle Challenger explosion, the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and the shock and awe campaign to start the 2003 Iraq war -- a phrase he scathingly said 'makes us look like foolish braggarts'.

Safer described his longtime colleague as 'America's favorite grouch-in-chief', saying Rooney used his 'loud whiny voice ... speaking up for citizens fed up with everything'.

'There have been many curmudgeons on television over its long history,' Safer said affectionately. 'None has been so long serving in that role as Mr. Rooney.'
