Brazil are in action for the first time since their humiliating 7-1 World Cup semi-final defeat and subsequent 3-0 thrashing by Holland in the third-place playoff.

Their friendly against Colombia in Miami is the first match since those results exposed the reality of their poor team and dealt crushing blows to the World Cup hosts which knocked the national team to the ground.

New manager Dunga, who replaced Luiz Felipe Scolari, has been tasked with hauling them back to their feet and turning them into the heavyweight world champions they once were.

Here, Sportsmail takes a look at what changes he has made and what to expect...

THE CULLED

Dunga took a hatchet to Brazil's World Cup squad and only 10 of the 23-man group made the cut – less than half.

The biggest casualties were Barcelona right-back Dani Alves and Real Madrid full-back Marcelo. Both are known for their marauding style on the flanks which has been horribly exposed in the past, something Dunga is no longer prepared to stand for.

Tottenham's Paulinho and former first-choice goalkeeper Julio Cesar are also two major names to have been left out.

THE NEW CROP

Three players will have the chance to prove themselves on their international debuts; Cruzeiro's attacking midfielders Everton Ribeiro and Ricardo Goulart and Corinthians centre-back Gil.

Of the three, Goulart is the most exciting addition. He is currently joint-top scorer in the Brazilian top-flight with nine goals, playing in the No 10 role for Cruzeiro. 

In July he scored a wonder goal from his own half in a friendly against Chivas. He is relishing his call-up, saying this week: 'Forget the World Cup. Now we are a different group and have a new coach.'

Another to be handed a chance many felt he was unfairly denied by Scolari is Philippe Coutinho. The Liverpool forward was frozen out by Scolari, but has finally got a real opportunity to prove his place in the national side. 

Happy about that, Philippe? Coutinho can prove his worth for Brazil against Colombia after being called up

RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE POSTER BOY

Neymar made a return to action at the weekend after a fractured back ended his World Cup dreams, coming off the bench in Barcelona's win against Villarreal.

The poster boy of the Brazil World Cup has been handed the captaincy, and if his performances in that tournament, when he dragged an average side through to the semi-final before his injury, is anything to go by he will lead by example.

It is likely that this friendly will pit him against defender Juan Camilo Zuniga, who was responsible for the flailing knee which struck Neymar's back and put him out of the tournament.

Dunga, himself a World Cup-winning Brazil captain, is confident he has made the right decision. 'Neymar has responded very well to it,' he said. 

'He is a player who likes challenges and like to win. We talked to him when we first broached the subject and we told him what we wanted. He's a player with a lot of quality, despite his age is experienced. The captain has to set the standard for the others.'

LUIZ THE LIABILITY

Another player who survived Dunga's savage cuts is David Luiz – and the world's most expensive defender will also be expected to shoulder more responsibility.

A friendly against Colombia is no better way to test the often inconsistent centre-back. Trying to deal with Manchester United's new striker Radamel Falcao and Real Madrid's £71million signing James Rodriguez could turn brutal.

Falcao is back from the knee injury which ruled him out of the World Cup. The last time he faced Luiz he tore him to shreds, scoring a hat-trick in Atletico Madrid's 4-1 Super Cup win back in 2012.

Rodriguez is also no longer 'El Nuevo Pibe' – The New Kid – the nickname he was initially given by Colombia fans in tribute to legend Valderrama who was called 'El Pibe.' The pair are a frightening prospect.

Brazil scraped through against Colombia when they met in the quarter-finals during the summer, but this could be very different.

NO ROOM FOR SENTIMENT

Despite wholesale changes there are still no recalls for Ronaldinho or Kaka, and Robinho was also omitted from the squad until Hulk got injured and he was brought in as a replacement.

They were the big names who Scolari largely ignored and it appears that Dunga has no interest in changing that decision.

The attitude of Ronaldinho, now 34, was questioned by the last regime while Kaka's career has been on a downward spiral since the 32-year-old left Milan in 2009. But Robinho, another with so much promise so young, now 30, has a glimmer of hope.
