Two beer lovers have invented a gadget to ensure a warm beer never has to be endured again.

Trevor Abbott and Ty Parker came up with the idea for the Spin Chill while they were waiting for two warm beers to cool in ice.

The gadget works by spinning the beer can in ice to increase the rate of heat transfer significantly through convection - the transfer of heat from one place to another by the movement of fluids.

Mr Parker, from St Augustine, Florida, said: 'We've run into the problem multiple times during our college career where we would be stuck with warm beers with only one way to cool them down, throw them in ice water and wait.

The Kickstarter project is seeking funding for a new invention that promises to chill a warm can of drink in under a minute. Using a basic drill and a device called a 'Chill Bit', the unique Spin Chill process uses convection to cool the beverage

The Spin Chill works by spinning the beer in a cool box full of ice so that the cold from the exterior of the can moves towards the centre.

According to the company, this cools the drink down at least 20 times faster than if it was in a freezer. 

It sounds like a simple concept, but the trick was to do this in such a way that the can doesn’t overflow when the fizzy drink is opened. 

By rotating the drink, instead of shaking it, air pockets in the liquid remain intact.  These air pockets are what cause drinks to fizz upon opening and overflow. 

This was an accidental discovery. ‘We were shocked to find that of the two beers we placed in the ice, one spinning and one stationary, that the stationary beer foamed more than the beer that was spun,’ said the creators on their website.’

'So, we decided to use our knowledge of heat transfer and love of cold beers to create the first Spin Chill prototype.'

The Spin Chill works by spinning the beer in a cool box full of ice so that the cold from the exterior of the can cools the liquid inside 20 times faster than if the can was simply placed in the ice box.

Its creators said the temperature of the drink can reach freezing in just two to three minutes using the device.

The pair both studied mechanical engineering at the University of Florida and were attending a hackathon - an event where participants can come together to create new ideas - when the first Spin Chill was created.

The Chill Bit is a drill attachment that fits on to the top of a can or bottle. The 'Beerouette', based on a drill , is a standalone, motorised device that spins the drink while it is submerged in ice

Mr Parker said: 'The initial prototype was hacked together at the competition the next day from a power drill, a baby bottle, and a roll or two of duct tape.

'Since then we have been prototyping, developing and refining the designs as well as creating the next product and have been enjoying travelling around, sharing our story and drinking cold beers with like minded people.'

The gadget works by spinning the beer can in ice to increase the rate of heat transfer significantly through convection - the transfer of heat from one place to another by the movement of fluids.

The pair explain on their website: 'It all has to do with the air pocket. A 'carbonated beverage' is one in which carbon dioxide is dissolved in the liquid under pressure.

'When the can is opened, the liquid inside starts to equalise with the pressure in the atmosphere, and the CO2 comes out of solution to do so.

'All carbonated beverages fizz upon opening, but whether they fizz over depends on how fast the CO2 comes out of solution.'

They said that for the carbon dioxide to escape suddenly, it needs gaseous pockets or an irregularity along the wall so when a drink is shake, the air pocket is broken up into millions of small pockets, dispersed throughout the liquid.

'When the container is opened, CO2 in solution has sites all over the place, and it comes out of solution so quickly, that the liquid has no time to get out of the way, and it rises up and out, that is, it fizzes over,' they said.

However, the pair explained that when a beverage is rotated, the air pocket stays intact and knocks all the small bubbles off the side of the container, making one larger air pocket.

'There are no nucleation sites dispersed throughout and the usual slow decarbonation takes place at the infrequent irregularities and at the surface,' they added.
