Battle: Iain Duncan Smith claimed ministers will 'shut the door' to migrants wanting to come to Britain to live on benefits

Ministers will ‘shut the door’ to migrants wanting to come to Britain to live on benefits, Iain Duncan Smith claimed yesterday.

He said he was determined to tighten the rules around eligibility for welfare benefits before a predicted influx of migrants from Romania and Bulgaria next year.

The Work and Pensions Secretary also suggested new rules to stop so-called benefit tourists could be applied to all migrants, even those from the rest of the European Union.

The measures could include requiring people to show they had put down roots here before claiming state help.

Under the ‘habitual resident test’, migrants could in future be required to show they had leased a home in this country for a year before being entitled to benefits.

Changes could also require contributions to have been made before some benefits can be claimed for the first time.

In a direct challenge to the EU, Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘My view of life is simple – we make sure our door is shut to those who want to come and claim benefits and is open to those who want to come and contribute and work and make this economy good and strong.’

He acknowledged he faces a ‘big battle’ with the EU, which is already threatening to sue Britain over existing rules on how quickly migrants can claim benefits. 

The issue is wrapped up in the free movement of labour rules, which are jealously guarded by Brussels.

But Mr Duncan Smith said ministers were building a powerful alliance with countries such as the Netherlands, Sweden and Germany, which also want to see changes.

He revealed Britain is also doing 
battle with Brussels over the ‘completely crackers’ rules that see 
£1million a week in welfare payments sent to children who live abroad 
while their migrant parents work in this country.

He suggested that both issues would form part of David Cameron’s demands as he tries to claw back powers from the EU.

The planned crackdown will be discussed at Chequers this week by the Prime Minister, Chancellor George Osborne and the Tories’ new election chief Lynton Crosby, who wants to put immigration and welfare at the heart of the 2015 election campaign. 

Mr Duncan Smith said he had held talks on the issue with Home Secretary Theresa May.

Whitehall fears that any move targeted at Romanian and Bulgarian migrants, who will be free to come and work in this country from the end of the year, would be certain to be ruled illegal by the EU.

But Mr Duncan Smith told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show he was confident he could win a battle with Brussels about wider rules governing the rights of migrants to claim benefits.
