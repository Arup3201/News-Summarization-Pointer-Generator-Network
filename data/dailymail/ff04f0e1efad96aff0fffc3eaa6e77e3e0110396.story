As the beleaguered Motor City searches for help out of its deep economic holes, voters seem prepared to shake things up Tuesday by electing the first white mayor in 40 years.

Former healthcare executive Mike Duggan, 55, is known for pulling Detroit's hospital system from the brink of bankruptcy and the 82 percent black city is poised to choose him over their history of choosing a mayor who looks like they do.

If Duggan beats his African-American opponent, Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon, it will be a first since Coleman Young set a new precedent as the city's first black mayor in 1974.

And the win appears likely. A poll released last week showed Napoleon lagging well behind Duggan, who also holds an almost 3-to-1 fundraising and spending edge.

Though Duggan, who is a recent transplant to Detroit, is somewhat of an outsider, even a leader of black nationalist group New Black Panther Nation supports him.

'In the last two national elections, African Americans have asked the nation to choose the best person for the job and not get caught up in colour. And twice, Barack Obama has won,' said Malik Shabazz, who's known for leading provocitve protests and calls to violence against the white establishment.

'Now, in Detroit, in 2013, the best man running is a white brother, and that’s OK,' he said.

Duggan's rise to prominence has been anything but typical.

History: Detroit, an 82 percent black city, has a 40 year history of electing a mayor who looks like they do

Duggan would become the first white man to lead the city in 40 years. Here, the last four leaders of the Motor City are current mayor Dave Bing (top left); Kenneth Cockrel Jr, who was elected in 2008 (top right); former mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, who is now serving a 28 year prison sentence for corruption charges (bottom left); and former mayor Dennis Archer (bottom right)

Only recently moved to Detroit from the outlying suburb of Livonia and even face pushback over his residency in the city during the primary.

But instead of throwing in the towel, the former hospital executive mounted a write-in campaign and beat Sheriff Napoleon by 20,000 votes.

Both Democrats have now advanced to the general election, which takes place Tuesday.

'A major part of why I have so much support is that everyone in the city understands that if you’re broke, you can’t deliver any services,' Duggan recently told the Washington Post. 'So I think there is a strong feeling in the city that we need a mayor who can balance the budget and operate the city well financially.'

Trailblazer: Coleman Young became Detroit's first black mayor in 1974 and led the city for the next 20 years

Only, regardless of who the winner is, the next mayor of the city that became America's largest to ever file for bankruptcy in July will have very little power.

Detroit is being guided through the filing by a state-appointed emergency manager, who must OK any requests for money made by the mayor.

'I think they're kidding themselves if they think they are going to regain financial control of this city,' said Detroit-based bankruptcy attorney Kenneth Schneider. 'Even after Kevyn Orr, there will be a financial advisory board that will maintain control of the city's finances indefinitely. The first part for any new mayor is to accept that and work with the state on how to right this city's finances.'
