The island where the Magna Carta is believed to have been signed, laying the foundations for modern democracy, has been put up for sale for just under £4 million.

Magna Carta Island, in the Thames, is thought to be the site where King John met with his rebellious barons in 1215.

They signed the Magna Carta - one of the world's best-known documents and widely regarded as the cornerstone of liberty in the English-speaking world.

The historic island where the Magna Carta was signed has been put up for sale for just under £4 million

Magna Carta Island, in the Thames, is a 3.72 acre piece of land with 402 metres of river frontage

Although it is not known where exactly the document was signed, it has long been believed that the island was the site of the meeting.

The King is said to have chosen the spot because he was protected by a circle of walnut 
trees and a gentle curve of the river which kept enemy longbows out of 
range.

A chapel was built on the island near Wraysbury, Berkshire in the 1600s, and in
 1834, it was expanded into a Grade II listed house by George 
Simon Harcourt, Lord of the Manor and the Sheriff of the County.

The walls in the charter room have the crest of King John and those of the 25 barons elected to keep the Magna Carta safe.

The
 owner of the island, which is reached by a humpback bridge, has now put
 it on the market for £3.95 million with Sotheby's Realty in Cobham, 
Surrey.

The island is a 3.72 acre piece of land with 402 metres of river frontage.

It is the site where King John met with his rebellious barons in 1215 for one of the most important meetings in British history

The house has a dining room that seats about 16 people, and a staff cottage with two bedrooms and a bathroom

Stuart Cole, head 
of region for UK Sotheby's International Realty, said: 'This is a once 
in a lifetime opportunity to buy a piece of world history where the rule
 of law was first forged.

'Not
 only is Magna Carta Island an idyllic private island in the Thames with
 402 metres of prime river frontage it is widely acknowledged to have 
been the site of the signing of the Magna Carta, perhaps the most 
significant charter in history.'

The main home on Magna Carta Island has seven bedrooms, four reception rooms and a swimming pool.

A large hallway leads through to a reception and a
 kitchen/breakfast room, off which are several small ante rooms.

On the first floor are six bedrooms along with the master bedroom with dressing room and bathroom and a family bathroom.

The cottage opposite the house features a reception room, kitchen/breakfast room, two bedrooms and a bathroom.

The
 grounds, which were mostly laid out in the 1920s, have an expansive 
lawn, topiary ewe trees and several important trees whilst 402 metres of
 river bank frontage to the Thames provide mooring for a large boat.

In
 1974, Queen Elizabeth II visited the historic island and planted a tree
 in the grounds. The gardens also included an additional cottage.

On the opposite bank of the river is the Magna Carta Memorial and The Kennedy Memorial.

The Magna Carta was first issued on June 15, 1215, by England's King John in Runnymeade.

The document was designed to prevent civil war by granting rebellious 
barons certain freedoms, including three that are enshrined in American 
government: an acknowledgement that taxes cannot be arbitrary, that free
 men cannot be imprisoned without first being judged by their peers or 
the law and that justice cannot be denied or delayed.

The commemorative plaque is part of a centre piece at the house. A chapel was built on the island near Wraysbury, Berkshire in the 1600s.
In 1834, it was expanded into the beautiful Grade II listed house
