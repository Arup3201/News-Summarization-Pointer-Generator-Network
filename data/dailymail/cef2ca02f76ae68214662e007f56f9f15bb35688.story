A University students' union has been forced to apologise after  using a Nazi SS victory symbol to advertise a German-themed drinking event.

Dozens of students at Aberystwyth University complained after spotting the resemblance between the double lightning bolt on the Bierkeller advert and the Siegrune used by Hitler's bodyguard.

University chiefs insisted the logo was accidentally used to separate Welsh and English text on the poster for the sold-out night and removed it from the Facebook event.

But students branded the organisers 'insensitive and inappropriate' for using a poster which glorified the brutal fighting force responsible for the Holocaust and other crimes against humanity.

Final year student Abi Leach said: 'I think it's highly insensitive, inappropriate and really stupid. Who thought that was a good idea?' 

Tom Reed said: 'Although undoubtedly an innocent mishap, an organisation which claims to be a professional establishment should not be making sloppy mistakes like that.

'I'm sure nobody was offended but they need to be more careful.'

The Siegrune (pictured in a 1940 recruitment poster for the Waffen SS, a wing of the Nazi party) was a common symbol on Nazi uniforms and on Nazi flags

The event, which is due to take place next Friday, will feature a performance from oompah and lederhosen band The Amazing Bavarian Stompers.

Not all students recognised the doublie lightning bolt as Nazi insignia. 

Nathan, a Politics student, said: 'The first time I saw it I just assumed it was lightening bolts to be honest, I didn't make a connection.'

Anyay Davoren added: 'I feel a bit bad I didn't recognise it as insignia. I should have paid more attention in history.' 

The SS, or Schutzstaffel, expanded from a small paramilitary unit to a powerful force that served as Hitler's bodyguard, the Nazi Party's 'Protection Squadron' and a force fielding almost a million men.

They were chosen to implement the 'Final Solution' and led the killing, torture and enslavement of more than 12 million people.

An Aberystwyth Student's Union spokesman said: 'We very much regret that this symbol appeared on a social media posting and can assure you that it was a genuine mistake that was simply used to separate the Welsh and English text, and was removed as soon as it came to our attention.

'This has not appeared on any of the official promotional material. We apologise for any offence caused.'

The SS used runic insignia on flags, uniforms and posters to promote Nazi  ideology.

They also represented virtues seen as desirable in SS members, and were based on völkisch mystic Guido von List's Armanen runes,  loosely based on the historical runic alphabets.

The Siegrune, which looked like a lightning bolt, symbolised victory for the elite fighting force. 

It was adapted into the emblem of the SS in 1933 by Walter Heck, a SS soldier.  

Heck's simple but striking device consisted of two sig runes drawn side by side like lightning bolts, and was soon adopted by all branches of the SS.

As well as standing for the initials of the SS, it could be read as a rallying cry of 'Victory, Victory!'.
