These pictures show serial killer Joanna Dennehy and one of her alleged accomplices walking hand in hand through a service station while police were searching for the pair.

In CCTV footage shown to jurors at Cambridge Crown Court today, the 31-year-old murderer and 7ft 3in Gary 'Stretch' Richards can be seen wandering through Strensham services off the M5 motorway, south of Worcester.

In the pictures, filmed at 8.43am on April 2 last year, Richards is seen putting his arm around the killer.

CCTV footage of triple killer Joanna Dennehy holding hands with one of her alleged accomplices was shown to a jury today

The pair can be seen casually walking through Strensham service station off the M5 in the footage

Dennehy, who has a pair of handcuffs attached to her jeans, then waits for him outside the toilets.

After about 10 minutes inside the service station, they head outside before driving to Hereford in a Vauxhall Astra.

Later that day, Dennehy randomly selected and repeatedly stabbed two strangers, Robin Bereza and John Rogers, as they walked their dogs in Hereford, the court has heard. The two survived the attack.

By that point Dennehy and Richards were wanted by police following the discovery of the body of Kevin Lee near Peterborough the previous day.

A farmer discovered the bodies of two other victims Lucasz Slaboszewski and John Chapman in a ditch on April 3.

Cambridge Crown Court has heard how Dennehy, pictured, drove to Hereford soon after this footage and stabbed two random strangers

Gary 'Stretch' Richards, seen with his arm around the killer, denies two counts of attempted murder

Richards is accused of driving 140 miles from Cambridgeshire to Hereford, passing through Suffolk, Norfolk and Leicestershire, with Dennehy in search of victims after she told him: 'I want to have my fun.'

Dennehy, of Orton Goldhay, Peterborough, has admitted murdering Mr Slaboszewski, 31, Mr Chapman, 56, and Mr Lee, 48.

She has also admitted the attempted murders of Mr Bereza and Mr Rogers and preventing the lawful and decent burial of all three murder victims.

Earlier this week, pictures of Dennehy, 31, posing with a knife while wanted by police were shown to the jury

Richards, 47, of Riseholme, Orton Goldhay, Peterborough, has denied three charges of preventing the lawful burial of all three men and two counts of attempted murder.

Layton, 36, of Bifield, Orton Goldhay, has denied perverting the course of justice and two counts of preventing the lawful burial of the bodies of Mr Chapman and Mr Lee.

A third man, Robert Moore, 55, of Belvoir Way, Peterborough, has admitted assisting an offender and is also awaiting sentence.

The trial of Stretch and Layton continues on Monday with the court hearing their defence.
