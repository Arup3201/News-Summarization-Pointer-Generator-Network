Property tycoon Donald Trump has said he will not name a successor but instead will divide his real estate empire between his three children.

The outspoken billionaire has said in an interview he intends for Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric to inherit different areas of the Trump Organisation.

He told the Wall Street Journal: 'My kids are treated very equally.'

Donald Trump and Ivanka Trump attend an awards ceremony. Daughter Ivanka has reportedly taken the lead negotiating role on some of the company's biggest deals

'I think, and I hope, for their own sake, that they’ll be able to get along... It’s not a deal where there’s going to be one person succeeding me.'

Daughter Ivanka has reportedly taken the lead negotiating role on some of the company's biggest deals, Business Insider reports.

It includes a $150 million acquisition of the Doral golf resort in Miami.

She also took the lead on the $48 million buy at the 92-story Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago.

Heavily pregnant Ivanka, has not let her condition stop her from being the successful businesswoman that she's known to be.

Last Tuesday, the blonde  - who is said to be 35 weeks pregnant - boarded a private jet with her billionaire father. The working pair paid a visit to the old post office in Washington, to view the space that will become the next Trump International Hotel.

Eric prefers dealing with the construction side of the business where as Donald Jr - the eldest - prefers leasing.

The decision to name more than one heir is unusual in the real estate industry - which normally picks just one child as successor.

William Zabel,  founding partner of the law firm Schulte Roth & Zabel, told Wall Street Journal: 'You have to give one of them the mantle and hope that it works.' Trump himself is said to be aware other such scenarios end in disaster, blaming it on 'jealousy, or something else.'

Earlier this week it was reported that Trump could be setting his sights on acquiring the FBI's colossal headquarters in Washington adding an enormous concrete block to his growing empire.

Trump, who already owns several million square feet of prime Manhattan real estate, as well as buildings across the US, hinted that he's interested in the vast building on Pennsylvania Avenue.

The billionaire has just completed drawing up a long-term lease for the city's Old Post Office Pavilion, a block west of the FBI HQ, to transform it into a $200 million luxury hotel.

They add to a growing empire of buildings for the real estate family, that includes the Trump National Golf Club, in Loudoun, purchased  2009, the Kluge Winery and estate in Charlottesville, The Trump Tower, in Tampa, The Trump International Hotel and Tower, in Toronto, and many more.
