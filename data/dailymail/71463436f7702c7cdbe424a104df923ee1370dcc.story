Take a look at the feet of any A-lister and it's likely you'll catch a flash of red.

From Victoria Beckham to Lily Allen, the iconic Christian Louboutin red sole has adorned many of the world's most famous feet.

And according to the French designer himself, even the super stylish Duchess of Cambridge has a pair stashed away, gifted to her by none other than Mrs Beckham.

Footwear fans: Victoria Beckham gave the Duchess of Cambridge a pair of Christian Louboutin boots, revealed the French footwear designer

'I know that Victoria Beckham offered her a pair of my boots and she looked great in them. She's been photographed wearing my boots. She looked fantastic,' he told The Times.

Victoria, 41, is known for her penchant for sky-high stilettos so it comes as no surprise that she's one of Louboutin's greatest fans.

However, sadly for Victoria and his army of A-list fans, Louboutin, who now has 91 standalone shops in 55 countries, admits that he doesn't think about comfort when designing his heels.

Man of the hour: Christian Louboutin, 51, revealed the information when he was promoting his debut beauty range, which consists of 31 nail varnishes

He said: 'The first emotion I want to provoke is: "How beautiful! How sexy!" I don't want people to think: "How comfortable."

'Being tall can often be a great thing for men and women. I remember a woman thanking me because she applied for a job wearing my shoes and got it. I said don't give me the credit - they might have given you some confidence, but I doubt anyone would give you a job because of your shoes. I wouldn't.'

That's ironic coming from the man who decided he wanted to start making shoes when he was just 12.

Fast forward to 1991 and he had opened his first shoe shop, with Princess Caroline of Monaco as its first customer.

Clients such as Diane von Fürstenberg, Blake Lively, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kim Kardashian followed and Louboutins have gone on to become the most searched-for shoe on Google.

Clearly keen to cash in on his success, the 51-year-old, whose shoes can cost between £480 and £2,000, has just launched his debut beauty range complete with 31 nail varnishes inspired by his famous shoes.

In fact, the reason the soles are red are because he 'felt as though something was missing' when he saw his first prototype shoe and decided to paint the bottom with his assistant's red nail varnish.

The Rouge Louboutin, inspired by that original red polish, will be the first colour to be unveiled on July 24, with 30 more to follow this summer.

The collection will be available at Harrods, Selfridges, Harvey Nichols and in Christian Louboutin stores.
