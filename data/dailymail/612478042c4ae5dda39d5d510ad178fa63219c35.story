The bouncer has been a staple of cricket since Fred 'The Demon' Spofforth is said to have parted W.G. Grace's beard in the earliest of Ashes battles - but the tragic passing of Phillip Hughes has even Merv Hughes, among the best exponents of the short ball, unsure when it will be a part of the game again.

Asked by Daily Mail Australia, what he thought will happen to the often intimidatory clashes between fast man and top-line batter, Merv Hughes said: 'I can’t begin to think for the current players but certainly the tragic passing of Phil Hughes will be on everyone’s mind for a little while.'

'Different people will handle it in different ways and it may take someone a little longer to get over it.'

'I’d suggest fast bowlers will be very mindful of the damage they can do,' said Merv Hughes

Merv Hughes said the Phillip Hughes death was as sombre and sad a time he's experienced, 'I can’t remember anything like it in any sport, to be honest'.

Phillip Hughes was brought into the Australian Test team by the selection panel which included Merv Hughes

Hughes, 53, is recognised one of Australia's all-time great fast bowlers. A colourful character who played 53 Tests for Australia and claimed 212 wickets during a 10-year international career. Merv Hughes was a renowned personality of the game with as much a combative streak on the pitch as a soft heart he showed off it - and while he feels the gladiatorial nature will return to the Test arena, he's unsure when that will happen.

'It is a part of the great game and again it’s going to affect people it in different ways and certainly time will tell but it’s hard to imagine that bowlers, over time, aren’t going to resort to the bouncer,' he said.

'It’s about taking a wicket and it’s about planting the seed of doubt but by no means, as a bowler, do you think that you’re going to hit someone or hurt someone.

'I’d suggest fast bowlers will be very mindful of the damage they can do.'

The man who once famously knocked the cap of West Indies legend Sir Vivian Richards during a Test match in the Caribbean added: 'As a fast bowler we are not trying to hit a batsman or hurt a batsman, we’re trying to take wickets so when you bowl a bouncer you are looking for a glove through to the wicket-keeper or possibly a catch down at deep square leg or deep fine leg, so it’s not about hitting batsmen it’s about taking their wicket.'

'Certainly it going to be in the back of people’s minds for a little while everyone is going to be different so it’s a case of seeing what comes of it,' he said.

Of the bouncer, Merv Hughe said: 'It’s about taking a wicket and it’s about planting the seed of doubt but by no means, as a bowler, do you think that you’re going to hit someone or hurt someone.'

Merv Hughes thoughts turned to Sean Abbott: 'My heart goes out to him, a young man early in his career, a promising young bowler.'

'Again I have met him a couple of times, I don’t know him all that well but I couldn’t even begin to imagine how he’s feeling or what he’s going through.

'It’s up to the individual and possibly time, you hope that he (Abbott) doesn’t hold himself to blame because it was just a tragic incident.

'Many bowlers have run in, over time, bowling short balls at batsmen and have hit batsmen and been worried about it. It’s very, very, tough for him - there’s no doubt about that - I can’t even begin to imagine.'

'My heart goes out to him, a young man early in his career, a promising young bowler,' Merv Hughes said of Sean Abbott. 'You hope that he doesn’t hold himself to blame because it was just a tragic incident.'

He told Daily Mail Australia that 'there has not been a more sad and sombre time'.

'When Phil Hughes got hit last week, you know that it was going to be fairly critical when three games of cricket are called off as a result.

'Since his passing on Thursday just the outpouring of grief and feeling of sadness, I can’t remember anything like it in any sport, to be honest.

'Just a young man taken so tragically, obviously he had a big future – to have played 26 test matches at the age of 25, to have accomplished what he had accomplished he was a very promising player and certainly the Australian selectors invested a fair bit of time on him and the view was that he was going to play a very big part in the cricket going forward.'

Merv Hughes has turned his hand to writing and acting in his post-cricket career

Post-retirement Merv Hughes played his part as an Australian selector and was part of the panel which brought Phillip Hughes into the international fold.

Since then he has turned his hand variously to writing, including his new book 'Merv Hughes' 104 Cricket Legends', as well as some acting and television work.

'I’ve made a living out of cricket and while I haven’t played for 20 years – you can go deep into it and cricket has given me the life I’ve got,' Merv Hughes said.

'I’m the first to put my hand up and say I was very fortunate with the way that I was seen as a cricketer and to go out and about now and be recognised is great.'
