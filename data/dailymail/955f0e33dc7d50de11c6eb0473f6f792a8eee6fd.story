The trip leader of an expedition in which a 17-year-old boy was mauled to death by a polar bear has told an inquest how he wrestled with the predator as it attacked him after his rifle failed to fire.

Horatio Chapple, a pupil at Eton College, was on an adventure holiday to the remote Svalbard islands in August 2011 with the British Schools Exploring Society (BSES) when he died.

Today trip leader Michael Reid, 31, from Plymouth, told an inquest into Horatio's death how he was awoken by several people shouting 'Bear attack' on the night the polar bear went on the rampage.

He said he grabbed the group’s rifle and left his tent, adding: 'The only priority was getting out as swiftly as possible and taking the rifle with me as this was a serious situation.

'The bear was close and it was on top of one of the YEs (young explorers) in their sleeping bags. I believe it was Scott Bennell-Smith.

'I was not focussing on other people other than the bear that was on top of person on the ground. I do not recall seeing Horatio.

'I cocked the rifle, took aim, aimed it carefully as I didn’t want to shoot the YE.'

Mr Reid said the rifle didn't fire, but it repeatedly failed to go off, and then the bear turned on him.

'The bear then came and attacked me because the rifle was then on the ground beside me,' he said.

'I shouted "Use your pen rounds" even though I hadn’t briefed the others where they were stored overnight, and although they are not safe to use (in close quarters), they are better than this bear carrying on.

'I remember the bear biting my head and I thought the weakest part is the eyes, so I tried to take out the eyes with my fingers, but was unsuccessful.

'Once it had moved off me I then recall asking "Where is my rifle?" and someone said "It’s in your tent" and I found it there.

The inquest into Horatio's death heard how the polar bear, pictured after it was shot dead, attacked the camp

'With one of the rounds that was on the ground having been ejected, I cocked the rifle and fired the round at the bear as it was attacking someone else.'

He said that this time the weapon worked.

Mr Reid said he had no recollection of seeing Horatio during the incident, but added: 'He was a member of our team, one of the best in our team if not the best in the whole expedition.

'He was a fine young gentleman with amazing potential.  I enjoyed being on the expedition with him.'

Mr Reid said a bear watch could have been held on the night of the attack but it would have left the team tired and vulnerable to cold-related illness during the coming day’s planned long trek.

Mr Reid, 31, who was seriously injured in the attack, added that although he believed the person he saw being attacked by the bear was Scott Bennell-Smith, from information he had since received this might be incorrect.

Mr Reid said the expedition had been supplied with an incomplete tripwire system, which meant they had to set it up in a triangular rather than rectangular shape, and said his group had to improvise using a paper clip to modify the trigger system because the brass fittings were missing.

The Etonian was described as 'a fine young gentleman with amazing potential'

Andrew Ruck, from Edinburgh, who was mountain leader for the group, described how the polar bear moved from attacking Mr Reid, known as Spike, to himself.

He said the bear at one point had its paws on his shoulders and he was looking straight into its face.

Describing waking up in his tent, he said: 'I woke up straight away and sat bolt upright, I then remember Spike or I opening the tent to see the polar bear there, I do not think it had anyone or anything in its mouth at that stage.'

He said that he then saw Mr Reid attempting to fire the rifle at the bear.

He said: 'He tried to fire the rifle four times, bullets emptied out, he shouted "It's not working" and then the bear came over to him and knocked him to the floor.

'After that I exited the tent through the other entrance. I just charged towards the bear, shouted and picked up rocks and threw them at its face.

'I remember the bear then attacked me and knocked me straight to the floor, its paws were on my shoulder, I remember seeing its face.

'It swiped my face with its claw and my head would have ended up in its mouth at some point.

'The bear left me for some reason but I had very few clear thoughts after that.

'I know I ended up not in the spot where it attacked me and ended up right next to Horatio, I must have been aware someone had been very badly injured and I think I was trying to help.'

Mr Ruck said that a decision had been made to use a tripwire system as an early warning alert that night and added that a bear watch would have had its own risks if it had been used instead.

He said: 'Bear watches themselves carry considerable risk, they are absolutely not a fool-proof system, they are open to human error - in 2002 I personally briefly fell asleep on a bear watch when I was 18 and I was a YE (young explorer).'

He added: 'Most encounters with polar bears are not fatal or even problematic. I am certainly aware that the behaviour of our bear charging into the campsite is completely abnormal.'

The camp site where Horatio Chapple was mauled to death. Witness Matthew Burke said: 'The bear reared up and then slammed itself down on to Horatio'

Matthew Burke, one of the young explorers , described how he saw the bear slamming down on to Horatio as it attacked him.

Describing the incident, he said: 'I sat upright to the screams of "bear, bear". I unzipped the inner and the front porch and I saw the bear at the front of Horatio’s tent in the porch.”

He said he then went out the back of the tent and saw Mr Reid aiming the rifle at the polar bear which was attacking a person he believed to be Horatio who was standing up in the porch of his tent.

He continued: 'The bear reared up and then slammed itself down on to Horatio, it used its paws and slammed down on Horatio. Spike was trying to shoot the bear.'

Mr Burke said he then went round to the outer tents and attempted to calm some of the other young explorers.

He then returned as the bear stopped attacking Mr Reid and turned on Mr Ruck before returning to attack Horatio who was only dressed in his boxers.

He added: 'After Andy was on the ground, the bear walked back to the tent with Horatio in it and continued to attack someone there, the person was half-in half-out of the tent with the porch of the tent on top of him.

'The tent had fully collapsed when the bear slammed down, this person was on top of it. At this point (the bear) was biting and clawing (Horatio).'

Mr Burke said he then went into the leader’s tent and pulled the rifle inside and unsuccessfully attempted to find some more bullets for it.

He continued: 'At that point I gave up searching and went out the back of the tent, it was at that point the bear spotted me and it chased me around the leaders’ tent and would change direction when I changed direction.'

He said the bear then went after Scott Bennell Smith and knocked him to the ground before returning to Horatio’s tent.

He continued: 'The bear didn’t see him (Scott) as a threat and went back to the first tent where it walked on top of the tent and it was clawing that tent. This is the point at which I believe Pat (Flinders) would have been injured.

'At this point Spike had got back to the rifle and fired the bullet. He took the shot and killed it.'

He said he went immediately to Horatio’s tent and added: 'He was dead, there was no sign, he wasn’t making any sound, wasn’t moving, you could just kind of tell.'

The inquest continues.
