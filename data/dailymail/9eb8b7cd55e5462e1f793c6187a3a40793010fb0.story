The body of Moors Murder victim Keith Bennett may have been buried nearly 40 miles from Saddleworth Moor, the focus of the search for his remains up to now, according to a forthcoming TV documentary.

The programme claims that photographs taken by Myra Hindley and Ian Brady as ‘grave markers’  during their killing spree show a Staffordshire beauty spot called Ramshaw Rocks.

Now experts are calling on police to search the site in case it is the 12-year-old’s final resting place.

Potential clue: The photograph shows Ian Brady holding a dog above his head at Ramshaw Rocks in Staffordshire

The news comes as Ian Brady is launching a legal battle to be given the right to die, according to the Sunday Telegraph.

The Moors murderer has been on hunger strike for the last thirteen years but is tube fed because he is sectioned under the Mental Health Act.

This week he will appear on a video link in the attempt to convince a Mental Health Tribunal that he should be declared sane and moved to a Scottish prison, where inmates are not force-fed.

The tribunal has been criticised by Keith Bennett's family, who say he should not be able to control his own fate.

In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph, the solicitor who acted on behalf of Keith's mother Winnie Johnson spoke out against the hearing.

John Ainley said: 'She took the view that he did not give her son and the other children any choice and consequently he should not be able to control his own fate'.

Brady's other victims – all aged between ten and 17 – were Pauline Reade, John Kilbride, Lesley Ann Downey and Edward Evans. 

They were killed in and around Manchester between July 1963 and October 1965 and their bodies were discovered in graves dug on Saddleworth Moor, above Oldham.

Victim: 12-year-old Keith Bennett disappeared on the way to his grandmother's house in 1964. Brady is believed to have sexually assaulted and strangled Bennett.

Keith’s body was also thought to have been hidden there but it has never been found.

Hindley,
who died in prison aged 60 in 2002, and Brady, 75, who is held in 
high-security Ashworth Hospital on Merseyside, took hundreds of 
photographs as grisly mementos.

The ITV documentary - entitled Brady And Hindley: Possession - suggests that some of the pictures may hold the key to the whereabouts of Keith’s grave, and possibly to the burial sites of other, as yet unidentified, young victims.

Author Duncan Staff, who has written extensively about the Moors Murders, said: ‘Ian Brady has been collaborating on a book to be published on his death in which he will allegedly claim there were nine murders, not just the five we know about. 

‘For 50 years Brady has enjoyed game-playing. The fact that this case remains unresolved gives him a great sense of satisfaction.

Tragic: Despite comprehensive searches of Saddleworth Moor, Keith Bennett's body has not been found

'I can’t say from these photographs 
that X marks the spot but they are of enough significance to warrant a 
proper search of Ramshaw Rocks.’

His views are supported by Myra Hindley’s long-term lover Trisha Cairns and forensic archaeologist Professor John Hunter.

Mr Staff said: ‘I described the pictures to Trisha, which included wild, rocky landscapes and Ian Brady holding a dog over his head in front of a jagged rock. Trisha immediately said she thought they were markers because of the system the killers used.’

Prof Hunter has carried out his own investigation by matching the pictures with the Ramshaw Rocks landscape but says only a full police search will establish the truth.

The programme, to be screened next 
month, includes an interview with Carol Waterhouse who, along with her 
brother David, had a day out on Saddleworth Moor with the killers – and 
survived.

Ms Waterhouse lived a couple of doors away from Hindley and Brady.

Tragic: Keith Bennett's mother Winnie Johnson died last year having never been able to bury her son

Now
a successful businesswoman, she tells the programme: ‘Myra was sociable
and bubbly whereas Brady kept to the background more.

They would give 
us sweets and really seemed like they had time for us.’

Recalling the day of the trip to Saddleworth Moor, she says: ‘They brought a picnic and I remember it was a nice day.

'Brady’s camera was always there and we walked along by the river having our photos taken.’

Brady, who has been declared criminally insane, has been on hunger strike for years and wants to be allowed to die.

He is kept alive by doctors at Ashworth Hospital, where he has been held since 1985 at an estimated cost to the taxpayer of nearly £8 million.

Keith Bennett’s mother, Winnie Johnson, died last year, never having been able to give her son a proper burial. 

A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said: ‘We are aware of the theory that Keith Bennett may be buried at Ramshaw Rocks.

However, there is no tangible evidence to support it and we have no plans to extend the search.’
