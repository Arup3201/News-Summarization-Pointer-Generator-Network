Darren Fletcher thinks Steve McManaman, who branded the current Manchester United side the worst he had seen in 20 years, will be eating a large portion of humble pie come the end of the season.

McManaman laid into United following their 2-1 defeat to Swansea on the opening day of the season.

The former Liverpool and Real Madrid man, who was a pundit for BT Sport at Old Trafford this weekend, claimed Louis van Gaal possesses the worst United squad he had ever seen in two decades.

Prove a point: United vice-captain Darren Fletcher is determined to silence critics by helping team win trophies

Fletcher thinks McManaman, and United's other critics, have been desperate to take pot shots at the club as a consequence of their recent success.

And the United vice-captain thinks the former England international will be eating his words at the end of May.

'People have been waiting for an opportunity to have a go at United for years and this is the perfect time (to do it),' the Manchester United midfielder said.

'It's a long season and I don't think they will be saying those things at the end of it.

'I believe we're going to have a very good season.

'All the players believe that too.

'Comments like that give us a greater determination, without a shadow of a doubt.'

Having been part of the United team that finished seventh last year, Fletcher knows how it feels to be on the receiving end of some scathing criticism.

The midfielder may have just been 11-years-old at the time, but he also remembers when former Match of the Day pundit Alan Hansen told Sir Alex Ferguson 'you can't win anything with kids' in 1995.

Ferguson won the league that year and scooped a further 10 titles after building a team around a group of youth players from the famed 'Class of '92'.

Fletcher thinks Van Gaal's squad has a similar look to it as the one that contained the likes of David Beckham, Paul Scholes and a young Ryan Giggs just over a decade ago.

Belief in youth: Van Gaal is giving young players at the club a chance to impress, including Tyler Blackett, left

'To be honest it felt like that in the dressing room today,' said Fletcher, who played alongside debutants Tyler Blackett and Jesse Lingard on Saturday.

'It did have a feel of that in terms of people looking at the squad and maybe not seeing household names, but these players are good enough and the manager believes in them.

'All you need is a platform to go and perform and I'm sure they'll definitely go and prove people wrong.

'This whole club is about bouncing back from adversity.'

Van Gaal has lost experienced heads like Giggs, Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra from his playing squad this summer.

But Fletcher thinks the players that remain are strong enough personalities to fill the void.

He said: 'People talk about the players that have left but I see it in the eyes of the young players, they're ready for it and determined to show people how good they are and we're determined to show people how good the team are.

'You have to be a big character to play for this club.'

Back on track: Wayne Rooney scored an acrobatic equaliser for United but it was not enough to gain a point

Wayne Rooney equalised for United following Ki Sung-yueng's opener with an overhead kick from short-range.

But the striker's first outing as captain ended up being one to forget thanks to Gylfi Sigurdsson's 72nd minute winner.

Rooney admitted it was a far from ideal way to start the season, but the striker trusts Van Gaal to pick the team up in the coming days.

'This is a really bad result for us, but we will learn, especially with the manager we have got,' Rooney said.

'He is strong and he wants 100 per cent every game.

'We know last season was a disaster. It wasn't good enough and we were ready for the start of this season.

'Maybe after a good pre-season we were a bit over confident.

'But we just have to look at the bad points and cut them out. If we do that we will win games.'

Match-winner: Swansea midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson scored the decisive goal in the second half at Old Trafford

Sigurdsson, meanwhile, could not think of a better place to score on his second debut for Swansea.

'Getting three points at Old Trafford is always special, but to score the winner here has been a dream for me ever since I was young,' said Sigurdsson who returned to Swansea this summer following a two-year spell at Tottenham.

'It is one of the biggest stadiums in the world.'
