British denim brand Pepe Jeans London is celebrating its 40th birthday in style ... with an achingly hip street-style advertising campaign featuring Cara Delevingne.

Model of the year Cara poses alongside bright young things actress Mia Goth, 19, and model Jeremy Young, 21, on the roads of Notting Hill in the 'Have You Seen Pepe' campaign, shot around the streets of Portobello where the jeans brand first came to life four decades ago.

The campaign shot by British fashion photographer Josh Olins and styled by Claire Richardson draws on some of West London’s most iconic backdrops as well as local boozers and pretty parks highlighting the brand's affinity with the eclectic area.

In the pictures this crew of beautiful
people travel from the culture-clash streets of Portobello through to 
the ornately manicured vistas of Kensington Park in their mission to 
find the mysterious 'Pepe', dressed - naturally - in seriously cool 
denim.

20 year-old Cara is following in the footsteps of her friends Sienna Miller and Alexa Chung by pulling on the British brand skinnies.

Comparing her style to her friends' the blonde said on the shoot: 'My style is a mixture of both Sienna and Alexa although I’m more tom boyish than either of them. They dress very casually, but still look very chic all the time.'

Cara's advice to aspiring models: 'Don't let people knock you down, keep grounded and be happy,'

The Pepe Jeans London campaign is the latest addition to Cara's already stellar modelling CV.

The Londoner is currently the face of Burberry and Chanel, and landed her first ever British Vogue cover this month.

Her advice for asipring models? 'Don’t let people knock you down, keep grounded and be happy and have a great agent ... and have a good relationship with them.

'I have a great support network, my family, my model agency Storm, people I work with in the fashion industry and of course all my followers on Twitter who stop me from feeling lonely, I love them all, they keep me grounded.'

Pepe Jeans London prides itself on finding fresh new advertising faces destined to become the stars of tomorrow and previous models have included Bridget Hall, Laetitia Casta and Edie Campbell

2012 was a brilliant year for the young model: she made her debut at the Victoria's Secret show in November, bagged the coveted model of the year title at the British Fashion Council awards and was labelled as 'the new Kate Moss' by epic photographer Mario Testino.

Cara says: It’s crazy to be even be considered in 
the same calibre as Kate, it’s a huge compliment but scary even to be 
mentioned in the same breath'

But Kate doesn't need to worry, it's Gisele's gig the model is chasing next: the Chanel cosmetics campaign is the fashion job she would love to get.

She adds: 'And I would love to design my own range 
of t-shirts, really beautiful and simple t-shirts,

'I love them and wear 
them all the time and I can never find really plain ones. The devil is 
in the detail.'

Starting life on the streets of London’s Notting Hill, it didn’t take long before the capital’s most trend-savvy hipsters were flocking to Portobello Market to lay their hands on a pair of the most in-demand jeans of the day.

Detail-rich denims with an unswerving attention to fit and fabrication helped set Pepe Jeans London apart from the swathe of bland and anonymous jeans brands of the time. Visionary and market redefining collections have come to define Pepe Jeans London, from Kinetic Denim, the first resin-coated denim on the market, and TrueSize, the first non-shrink raw denim, through to the Tru-Blu® collection which uses zero chemicals and slashes the amountof water used in the laundering process.

This commitment to denim-led innovation continues to inform the design spirit of the company 40 years later.

In 1984 Pepe Jeans London landed on U.S. soil. Encouraged by immediate Stateside success and fuelled by an appetite to spread the brand message in a sexy and cool way they hired the most celebrated fashion photographer of the decade, Bruce Weber, to shoot what was their biggest ever ad campaign at the time.

This inaugural campaign with Weber helped propel ascending model Bridget Hall to the supermodel stratosphere and set a precedent in the firm's ability to find fresh new advertising faces destined to become the stars of tomorrow.

Cinema and TV campaigns followed. From performance artist Leigh Bowery’s extravagantturn in front of the camera to Raindance, a 90-second love story filmed between Nevada and Notting Hill and set to the bass-rattling soundtrack of The Smiths’ iconic anthem How Soon Is Now, each campaign has left an indelible mark in the annals of fashion advertising.

Brit it girl of the moment Cara Delevingne and future film starlet Mia Goth are the latest in the long line of celebs who have appeared in the campaigns. From Jason Priestley, Laetitia Casta, Donovan Leitch and Ashton Kutcher, to Sienna Miller, Cristiano Ronaldo and Alexa Chung and Edie Campbell, Pepe Jeans London has always had a passion for discovering new talent.
