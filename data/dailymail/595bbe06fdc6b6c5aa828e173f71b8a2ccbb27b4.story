A high school substitute teacher has been fired after police say he took pictures of his students without their knowledge and posted them to a perverted website.

Authorities in Georgia say the former teacher at East Coweta High secretly snapped several photos of his underage female students before posting them to Reddit's Creepshot webpage for others to view and share.

Despite some of the photos appearing non suggestive, with at least one girl plainly sitting in her classroom chair, parents found their added captions disturbing, especially when describing teenaged girls.

Creeper: A substitute teacher at this high school has been fired after allegedly taking pictures of his female students without their knowledge and posting them online

It was a photo of one girl labelled by the teacher as 'Hot Senior Girl in One of My Classes,' according to Jezebel, that was recognized by a Reddit reader who lashed out promising to report him to authorities.

'I know that girl, and I know which teacher you are. I hope you're looking forward to getting fired, you creepy a--hole,' the Reddit user commented.

School officials have since contacted the Coweta County Sheriff's office prompting an investigation of the teacher who has not been identified.

The Sheriff's office tells Fox5 that the teacher has since been fired from the school system which claims to have conducted a background check on the man prior to his hiring that returned clean.

Rule change: Immediately following news of the teacher's behaviour Creepshots posted a rule change banning photos of those under the age of 18 as well as in or near a school

Criminal charges have not been filed.

'FYI this is my daughter. This teacher is caught and being handled accordingly,' a Reddit user later commented on the girl's photo that has since been removed.

'YES HE WAS A TEACHER!!!! She was not his only victim. I beg you to do everything you can to stop this from happening to innocent girls!!! Whoever turned him in, THANK YOU!!! Even though there "are no laws broken" so far by this, hopefully your actions have at least put him on the radar of the local authorities!' they wrote.

Creepshot, which offers thousands of user-submitted pictures of women unknowingly photographed in public, often with the focus on their breasts or backsides, until recently had limited rules on its content.

On Thursday a new rule was posted on the forum banning photos taken 'on/in/around school settings or of "school girls" unless you can confirm that they are not minors.'

'There is nothing illegal about this subreddit, whatsoever,' a moderator wrote with the posted rule change. 'Creepy, sinister, skin-crawling and generally downright distasteful... yes. But nothing illegal.'

On their upskirt forum, that publishes nude shots of women, rule changes mutually rippled over in a post by a moderator declaring voyeur shots now banned.

'Only posed upskirt shorts will be allowed!' the moderator wrote.

The post caused immediate upset with one user writing that they'd be now unsubscribing.

'It's unfortunate to lose those that choose to leave. But morally, ethically, and in some cases, legally, content slips in that will have this subreddit removed all together. Removing some of the questionable content is what I'll do. If I lose subscribers because of it, so be it,' the moderator commented back.
