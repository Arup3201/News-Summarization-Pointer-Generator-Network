The wreck of a Soviet submarine lost during World War Two has been found in the Baltic Sea, 71 years after it sank.

The Swedish Armed Forces said the submarine, believed to have been lost on patrol in late 1941, was found in the Swedish economic zone southeast of the Baltic island of Oland.

It is thought to be that of the S-6, which disappeared in August or September 1941.

They said the submarine, believed to have been lost on patrol in late 1941, was found in the Swedish economic zone southeast of the Baltic island of Oland

It was an area which German forces had mined during the war.

In a statement, the armed forces said: 'In the autumn of 1941, several Russian submarines left their home bases to patrol the Baltic Sea.

'Several of them never returned. One of them has now been found, blown up into large pieces, southeast of Oeland.

'There is much to indicate that the submarine headed straight into the minefield while on the surface and was blown apart by a mine.'

The wreck was first reported by civilian divers during the summer months in the middle of this year

The vessel was found in international 
waters in Sweden's economic zone, in a heavily-mined area known as the 
'Wartburg minefield'.

According to rusnavy.com,
the submarine was identified by letters which were still readable on 
the ship's hull and the year 1936 stamped on its main 100mm gun.

On its website, the military has posted a video and still images of the wreckage, which had broken into two large sections.

The wreck was first reported by civilian divers during the summer months in the middle of this year.

In the following months, Swedish submarine salvage ship HMS Belos confirmed the find and photographed it, the military said.

'Blown up into large pieces': The wreck is believed to be that of the S-6 (pictured) which disappeared while on patrol in August or September 1941

Swedish authorities have now informed
Russia of the find in order to give family members and the Russian navy
the opportunity to conduct a memorial ceremony at the site.

The
S-6 was a diesel-electric attack submarine which belonged to the 
S-class of vessels nicknamed the Stalinets or 'follower of Stalin'.

She was laid down on December 28, 1935, at shipyard in Stalingrad and put afloat on March 31, 1938.

The submarine measured 77.80m long, had a crew of 50 men, was armed with 12 torpedoes and had a top speed of 19.5 nkots on the surface or 9 knots submerged.

Location: The wreck was found in international waters in a heavily mined area called the Wartburg Minefield

On August 2, 1941, the submarine started on her last deployment to Bornholm Island when her contact was lost.

S-class boats were the most successful for Russia during World War Two. In total, they sank 82,770 gross register tons of merchant shipping and seven warships.

That accounted for around one-third of all tonnage sunk by Soviet submarines during the war.

Several Soviet submarines sunk during World War Two have been found in Swedish waters over the years.

In June 2009, divers found the wreck of the S-2, another Soviet sub sunk by mines in January 1940 with some 50 crew members on board, in waters further north between Sweden and Finland.
