Manchester tops the league of premature deaths - with the highest rate of people dying before their time, according to new figures.

They show the best place to avoid an early demise is the market town of Wokingham in Berkshire, with the lowest level of avoidable deaths in England.

The north-south divide is laid bare in a national league table published today of premature deaths under the age of 75 over a two-year period.

The north-south divide is laid bare in a national league table published today of premature deaths under the age of 75 over a two-year period. Manchester tops the league of premature deaths - with the highest rate of people dying before their time - while the best place to avoid an early demise is the market town of Wokingham in Berkshire, with the lowest level of avoidable deaths in England

But England also fares badly in a European league table of premature mortality in 17 countries in 2010.

Women
 in England have the third worst rate - with only Belgium and Denmark 
doing more badly - and men are seventh for avoidable deaths, according 
to data released earlier this year. 

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said
 ‘This shocking variation in early and unnecessary deaths means people’s
 lives are needlessly cut short and that cannot continue unchecked.

‘I want areas to use the data 
released today to identify local public health challenges like smoking, 
drinking and obesity and to take action to help achieve our ambition for
 saving 30,000 lives a year by 2020.’

The new Longer Lives league table 
website from Public Health England ranks 150 local authorities using a 
traffic light system, ranging from red for the worst areas to green for 
the best.

It says there are 103,000 avoidable 
early deaths in England each year, with four major killers including 
heart disease and cancer responsible for 75 per cent of those deaths.

In
 Manchester, there were 455 premature deaths per 100,000 people from 
2009 to 2011 - more than twice as many as the best performing area of 
Wokingham with 200 such deaths in the same period.

Manchester
 has the highest death rate from cancer in the country, with 152 deaths 
per 100,000 people recorded, as well as from heart disease and stroke, 
with 116 deaths per 100,000 people.

But Blackpool has the highest rates for liver and lung disease, with 39 and 62 premature deaths per 100,000 in that time.

The best performing area to live out a long life was Wokingham in Berkshire

 says there are 103,000 avoidable early deaths in England each year, 
with four major killers including heart disease and cancer responsible 
for 75 per cent of those deaths.

England is seventh out of 17 European countries for men and 15th for women.

Professor
 John Newton, chief knowledge officer at Public Health England, said 
health inequalities in England should be tackled urgently.

He said ‘The message for local authorities is that there are a large number of people dying before they should and that there are things that can be done.’

However, recent figures suggest the situation is improving, with overall premature death rates coming down, he added.

Prof Newton said ‘What we are doing is providing information that is hard hitting and sometimes challenging but is presented in a form that is accessible and easy to understand.’

The website classifies areas with similar levels of deprivation so local authorities can see how they compare.

The peer ranking shows Rotherham and Redcar and Cleveland are doing well among the most deprived areas, while Bracknell in Berkshire and Central Bedfordshire have some of the highest rates of early death in the least deprived areas.

Professor Kevin Fenton, PHE’s director of health and wellbeing, said he hoped the site would spark a national debate on tackling premature deaths - rather than worry those living in areas given a red traffic light rating.

Under the NHS reforms, local councils have been given new responsibilities to enhance public health in their catchment areas.

The new website aims to give them information about the current situation in their region so health funding can be spent where it is most needed, said Public Health England.

Councillor Zoe Patrick, chairwoman of the Local Government Association’s community wellbeing board, said ‘The Longer Lives tool will provide some useful insight into the serious public health challenges facing councils and help us identify local priorities.

‘But this data must be used with caution. Using it out of context to create any sort of national league table dangerously oversimplifies matters and ignores the very complex socio-economic and cultural factors that affect the premature mortality rate.‘
