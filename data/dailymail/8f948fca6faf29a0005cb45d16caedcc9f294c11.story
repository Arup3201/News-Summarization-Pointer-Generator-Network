A pet frog had to be taken to the vets after he swallowed an engagement ring belonging to his owner's fiancée. 

The amphibious pet, called Croak, snapped the ring up after his owner's girlfriend accidentally dropped it while the frog was out of his aquarium.

Unable to retrieve the ring, owner Roman Livane, 27, was forced to take his pet frog to the vet who, despite initial reservations, managed to return it to its rightful owner.

Owner Roman Livane, 27, was cleaning out the glass aquarium where the frog is kept when it snapped up the ring

Mr Livane was cleaning out the glass aquarium where he keeps the frog when the incident took place.

He said: 'I have had him for almost 10 years - he's like part of the family. 

'My girlfriend Kristina is the only girlfriend I have ever had that also likes frogs, so we are a perfect partnership. 

'But I admit things got a bit strained when I asked her to look after him, and he was sitting on the table while she was playing with her engagement ring. 

'She dropped it and it fell towards the table where my frog was sitting, and as quick as a flash it snapped the ring out of the air and swallowed it.'

The couple tried to retrieve the ring, but before they had the chance the frog had already swallowed it. 

Veterinarian Julia Malyshev at first thought the couple were playing a practical joke, but X-rays revealed the frog had indeed swallowed the ring

Ms Malyshev said the ring was too big for the frog to pass and so she was forced to carry out a 'difficult operation'

They then took it to the vets near their home in the city of Yekaterinburg. 

Veterinarian Julia Malyshev, 38, said: 'I must admit I was sceptical about whether or not it was some sort of a practical joke but when I X-rayed it, sure enough there was the engagement ring complete with stone in the frog's stomach.

'It was clear that it was too big to ever pass out in the natural way, and as they didn't want to kill the frog I had to use a special hook to pull the ring out which was a difficult operation. 

'Although it did not involve any surgery the frog has had to go on a diet now for three days to make sure there is no lasting damage from the tricky procedure.'

After being washed the ring was returned to Kristina, 26, who said they are now continuing with their plans for the wedding, which is due to take place at the start of August.
