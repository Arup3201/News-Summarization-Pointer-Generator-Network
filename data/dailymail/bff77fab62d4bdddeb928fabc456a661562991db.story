A super speedy teenager from Tasmania is well on his way to becoming Australia's next big hope at the Olympics after smashing the country's 100m under-18 record.

Jack Hale, 16, set the track alight at a race meet in Hobart where he ran an incredible 10.44 seconds in the 100m sprint yesterday.

The crowd watched on in amazement as a star was born on the track when he also broke the Tasmanian men's open 100 metres record.

The teenager from Tasmania says he hopes to build on his success and get a gold medal at the Olympics

Hale surprised his trainers who described his performance so early in the season as 'sensational' 

Hale also broke the Tasmanian men's open 100 metres record at the race meet in Hobart 

Hale, who was until recently a long jump specialist, says he has set his sights high in the sprinting arena.

'At the moment I'm not extremely serious about it, but in the future if I keep improving I'll definitely want to take it to the Olympics with a gold medal,' he told ABC. 

Hale revealed the secret to his success is a new training regime of adding weighted box jumps into his routine. 

'I've started doing them about three months ago and I've been doing them three times a week, weighted box jumps I think they have really helped me,'

'Also, I've stopped doing heavy weights training and stuck to a bit of power exercises,' ABC reported. 

Hale's trainers were also impressed with his amazing performance calling it 'sensational' and 'beyond what we were expecting'.

Brian Rowe, from Athletics Tasmania, told ABC Hale was already 'very talented' for achieving such a great time so early on in the season.

'A young fellow, 16-year-old, comes out of the winter, does a bit of winter training for the first time, already very talented, and is more than capable, although 10:44 is a bit beyond what everyone was expecting.

'To achieve that so early in the season, at what many would say were the school sports, is absolutely astounding, and an outstanding performance by a young man who has only been known as a long jumper. 

Hale recovers from the amazing achievement and lets the shock settle in with his friends after the race 

Hale is part of a new crop of talent, some of whom recently returned from the world junior championships in Oregon, USA 

'All the interschool carnivals here are permit meets and today's meet was run with fully electronic timing with a fully accredited national official with a wind gauge in operation,' Mr Rowe said.

The Tasmanian Institute of Sport had supported young athletes who were able to access training tracks around the clock.

Mr Rowe added: 'We've got a really talented group of young sprinters at the moment and these things are cyclical, but... if you are talented here you've really got the springboard to go ahead.'
