A paedophile was given access to children’s homes to advise the Home Office about child care reforms, it was claimed yesterday.

Peter Righton, who later co-founded a pro-paedophilia campaign group, interviewed vulnerable children as he researched a government report.

The academic had already left a teaching job over complaints of child sex abuse and went on to be a founding member of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE).

Peter Righton - a founding member of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) - advised the Home Office on a report which led to the reform of Britain's children's home, it emerged today

The 1970 
report, authored by a Home Office advisory committee, credited him for 
his ‘considerable assistance’ in a chapter on training for children’s 
home workers.

At
 the time Righton was considered a leading expert on social work 
training and was the former director of education at the National 
Institute for Social Work and a consultant for the National Children’s 
Bureau charity. Righton was later arrested and fined £900 for importing 
child abuse images in 1992 and was cautioned for an earlier assault. He 
died in 2007, aged 81.

A
 former care professional, who asked not to be identified, said 
Righton’s work on the Home Office report had allowed him to ‘network’ at
 children’s homes, previously known as approved schools.

Righton is said to have visited care homes and schools around the UK, including Bryn Estyn in Wrexham, where 'appalling' abuse was later uncovered involving 140 former residents

He carried out research across Britain, including visits to homes in Stoke-on-Trent, Rochdale and Preston.

The
 retired worker told Radio 4’s Today: ‘He [used to] go and interview, in
 approved schools, individual boys and he certainly went to speak to the
 heads of homes.’ He added: ‘He was a very dangerous man because he was 
put in a position where he could abuse trust.’

The
 former care worker said Righton had visited the Bryn Estyn approved 
school in Wrexham and claimed he ‘took boys out’ and used ‘sexual’ 
language. Bryn Estyn was later hit by a scandal in which 140 former 
residents alleged they were abused between 1974 and 1984.

An
 official report detailed ‘appalling’ abuse and former housemaster Peter
 Howarth was jailed for ten years for abusing boys as young as 12. He 
died in jail. Howarth had previously taught at the same school in Kent 
where Righton had faced a child abuse complaint. The complaint did not 
lead to criminal charges and Righton’s paedophilia did not appear to be 
known when he was working on the Home Office committee report.

But
 by the mid-1970s he had become a founding member of the PIE, which 
lobbied for sex between adults and children to be decriminalised.

The 
Oxford-educated academic was later arrested over child abuse images and a
 search of his home revealed documents said to include evidence of a 
wide-reaching paedophile network.

When
 Labour MP Tom Watson called for an inquiry into Righton in 2011 police 
interest in allegations involving the Elm Guest House – a hotel in 
London where children from a home in Hounslow were reportedly brought to
 have sex with adult men – was reignited.

The Home Office refused to comment on Righton’s role in researching the 1970 report.
