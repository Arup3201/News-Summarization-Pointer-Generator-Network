A mixed-breed dog that was set on fire last month by its Florida owner leaving her entire body heavily scarred is making a slow recovery as she remains in the intensive car unit at a Tampa vet.

For reasons that are unclear, on March 20, the owner of one-year-old Hope set her on fire in Arcadia, about 90 miles southeast of Tampa. The ownes has not been identified and police are continuing to investigate the cruel incident.

While she has been in the care of Tampa's BluePearl Veterinary Partners, she has had a tremendous amount of dead skin and tissue removed, and recently, had her sixth laser therapy treatment.

BluePearl is one of only nine nationally recognized veterinary trauma centers in the U.S.

'So far, Hope is doing very well in response to our treatment plan,' Dr. Helga Bleyaert, a veterinary surgeon supervising Hope's care, said. 'I'm still a little concerned about her eyes, but we should know more [later] when our ophthalmologists take another look at them.'

Although Hope still has a long road ahead to complete her recovery, veterinarians are optimistic.Â 

Hope has had six laser therapy treatments due to her injuries

'She's still in a very intensive phase of wound care and of medications, but the great thing is she's eating, she's drinking, and she's off of IV fluids,' Dr. Sonja Olson told Fox13. 'She's on oral medications. She's on topical medications.'

A local organization, the Hardee Animal Rescue Team, has begun collecting donations for Hope's care. So far, the public has donated more than $40,000.
