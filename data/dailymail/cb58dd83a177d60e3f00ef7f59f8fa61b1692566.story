Manchester City are considering a £100million bid to buy Luis Suarez.

Suarez has come to the fore for Barcelona for the first time this season since his £75m move from Liverpool last summer.

The Uruguayan's two goals in Barca's 2-1 win at the Etihad Stadium would seem to have given City no way back when it comes to the Champions League last-16 second leg at the Nou Camp.

Luis Suarez scored twice on his return to England this week against Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium

Suarez added a third goal for the week, and created another, against Granada on Saturday

But overall since joining Barca things have not worked out well for Suarez.

Football Grapevine sources have been told that the club would like to move the striker on.

City are aware of that and would pay a huge amount to take the player now that they realise that their ambition to sign Lionel Messi is unlikely to ever come to fruition.

The major stumbling block to any deal this summer is that Barca remain under a transfer embargo until 2016 in the wake breaches of Financial Fair Play regulations.

Before this week Suarez had not hit the heights expected at Barcelona, and the club are keen to get rid of him

Sergio Aguero could be used as a makeweight as Barca cannot make any new signings until next January

So even if the Catalans cashed in on Suarez they could not sign a replacement until the next January transfer window.

It is understood however that a straight swap of Sergio Aguero and Suarez is not out of the question.

Alex Song believes he will get a move to Liverpool or Manchester City this summer.

But after another dire display for West Ham – this time in the 3-1 defeat against Crystal Palace - Song may find that Premier League clubs won't want to pick up his hefty wages.

Song is on loan at the Hammers from Barcelona and, after an excellent start to the season, his form has dipped massively.

Alex Song's form has dropped off significantly since the start of the season, but he still wants a big move

West Ham are picking up the thick end of his £140,000-a-week salary and are now less likely to make the move permanent.

Liverpool may still be interested given Steven Gerrard's departure.

But why would they pay that much to Song when they are in dispute with Raheem Sterling over his demands for £120,000-a-week?

It is understood, however, that Sterling will sign soon given that interest from Real Madrid has over blown.

Song believes he can play for a Champions League club, but his wage demands could be a sticking point

Dimitar Berbatov, who spearheaded Monaco's 3-1 win over Arsenal, wants one last hurrah in the Premier League next season.

Berbatov still has a house in Chigwell, Essex.

Dimitar Berbatov, who scored against Arsenal this week and has a house in Essex, wants a return to England

He would like to play for West Ham and even at 34 believes he could still do a job at that level.

Crystal Palace represents another option.

Crystal Palace beat West Ham 3-1, with all goals coming from set pieces.

That means that Palace have now scored 18 Premier League goals this season from set pieces - by far more than any other team. Not a lot of people know that.

Jimmy Greaves has hit back at reports that he has snubbed former club Tottenham for 45 years since he left Spurs.

It was stated in an article by a newspaper that Greaves has never been back to watch a game at White Hart Lance since he moved to West Ham in 1970.

But Greaves said: 'As a Sun reporter then a TV reporter I went there loads of times. Really loads. I launched my autobiography there and I attended the funerals of both Bill Nicholson and Bobby Smith.

'But I don't go to games. I never have. It's not just Spurs. I don't go to any of my other clubs either.'

And Greaves, who turned 75 last week, insists he did not turn down an invitation from Tottenham to be a guest of honour at Wembley for the Capital One Cup final against Chelsea - the club where he started his career.

'There was no invitation forthcoming but I wouldn't have gone if they did,' he said. 'I've got a lovely giant screen TV, a lovely dog and a warm fire. That's where I watch sport and it's very nice. I'm not interested in driving in heavy traffic and enduring big crowds and being freezing cold. I love it on TV.'

And no doubt if the Spurs-Chelsea game gets a bit dull for Greaves he will flick channels to watch the Six Nations crunch clash between England and Ireland.

During a speech he made at a dinner recently Greaves made it clear he tires of the antics of footballers and has grown to prefer rugby union.

Daniel Alves will choose between Manchester United and Juventus when his contract at Barcelona expires this summer.

Howard Webb retired at the end of last season

West Ham boss Sam Allardyce has backed a call for Howard Webb to return to refereeing.

Webb hung up his whistle last summer after officiating at the World Cup.

He has taken up a role at the Professional Game Match Officials Ltd but former ref chief Keith Hackett believes Webb is wasted.

'Most agree Howard was our top referee and had been for many seasons. There has been a dip in standards this season and one of the reasons is because Howard is not around and one or two refs have been moved up to the big games and they are not good enough,' said Hackett.

'Howard is only 43. There is no doubt he has several more seasons in him.'

Allardyce agreed: 'Howard should come back out of his retirement. He was a referee who has the ability to manage to games and has been missed this season.'

I am hearing

Manchester City are still keen on luring Paul Pogba from Juventus.

The former Manchester United youth product is valued in the region of £60 million. City could offer Yaya Toure as part of the deal, although Paris Saint-Germain would enter the market should the Ivorian become available.

I am also hearing

Sam Allardyce has recommended that James Tomkins can help solve England's problems at centre half and has also told England boss Roy Hodgson he should pick Mark Noble to add energy to his midfield.

I say :

It was interesting to attend an event of You are The Ref, a website run by former referee Keith Hackett in the week.

Another ex-ref Mark Halsey was on the panel alongside West Ham boss Sam Allardyce at Riley's Sports bar in London's Haymarket.

Many issues were discussed to an impressively attentive audience.

Most interesting was Hackett's proposal to get rid of yellow cards, introduce a sin bin and reserve sending offs for only the most serious offences.

Hackett has already raised the matter with the LMA who agree and want the FA to go ahead with a trial run in the conference.

'One of the big problems in the game right now is that we have a confetti card culture,' said Hackett.

Keith Hackett is keen to get rid of red cards for two bookings, like the one given to Glenn Murray on Sunday

'Refs are under directions to issue cards for all sorts of technical offences. Too often we see games ruined because a team has seen a player sent off for two 'soft' yellows. It also promotes a climate of confrontation.

'What we need is for refs to be allowed to manage games. If a player has made a bad foul the ref should warn him and if he transgresses then he goes into the sin bin.'

Allardyce backed the proposal: 'I like Keith's idea of getting rid of yellow cards and examining how a sin bin for say 10-15 minutes would work for a player who has totted up what would amount two yellows.

'It has an immediate impact but for a period of time without affecting the whole match. We have seen it work in rugby so why not give it a go?'

BTW

It was good to be in the company of many former Spurs stars during the week at Planet Hollywood for the launch the new football social media site Hinch.as – listening to Ossie Ardiles and Garth Crooks in a heated debate about politics and religion was absorbing.

But it wasn't about all our yesterdays. Indeed it was a pleasure to meet Newcastle Jonas Gutierrez who revealed that he was ready to return to Premier League action having undergone surgery to remove his left testicle due to cancer last September.

Indeed, the 31-year-old Argentine winger was in the Toon squad for Saturday's win against Aston Villa. He was engaging company and an inspiration to listen to. It is to be hoped he revives his career.

Testicular cancer affect men between the ages of 15 and 49. It accounts for 1 per cent of cancers that occur in men. More than 96 per cent treated early will be cured

I Bet :

Tottenham have a habit of seeing a season blow up in their face within a week.

While it was a great comeback to draw against West Ham, failure to win hit their top four hopes; then they were dumped out of the Europa League by Fiorentina.

And Chelsea are hot favourites to win the Capital One Cup, Coral quoting 4-7.

Harry Kane is a good shout as top goalscorer in the Capital One Cup final, but Chelsea are hot favourites

The draw at 90 minutes is 16-5. Optimistic Spurs fans will surely be tempted by 5-1 on them winning.

First goalscorer? Harry Kane in 7-1. And for a value punt Branislav Ivanovic is 20-1.
