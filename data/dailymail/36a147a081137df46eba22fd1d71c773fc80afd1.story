An image of Martin Luther King wearing a hooded sweatshirt has gone viral in the wake of George Zimmerman being acquitted of both murder and manslaughter charges in the Trayvon Martin case.

The photo illustration shows the American black civil rights leader wearing a grey sweatshirt, similar to the one the 17-year-old was wearing when he was shot dead in February 2012.

The image, which was tweeted by former Obama advisor and civil rights activist Van Jones, has been retweeted by hundreds of thousands of users on Twitter. 

Message: An image of Martin Luther King wearing a hooded sweatshirt has gone viral in the wake of George Zimmerman being acquitted of both murder and manslaughter charges in the Trayvon Martin case

The image, which was tweeted by former Obama advisor and civil rights activist Van Jones -  the image is meant to capture the link between Martin Luther King's fight, right, the death of Trayvon Martin, left, and the ongoing battle for racial equality in the U.S.

He posted the image with the words - 'April 4th, 1968 #RipTrayvonMartin.' The date is the when the black civil rights leader was assassinated in Tennessee.

King was an American clergyman, Nobel 
Peace Prize winner and one of the principal leaders of the United States
civil rights movement - the image is meant to capture the link between King's fight, the Trayvon Martin case and the ongoing battle  for racial equality in the U.S.

The image appears to be the work of 
artist Nikkolas Smith - he posted the image on his website next to the 
statement: 'The Dream will never die. It is more powerful than fear or 
violence. It can never be swindled away or destroyed. It is one of Love,
and therefore timeless. ' 

During the trial the garment was used
as evidence and a bullet hole could be seen in the front of
the hooded top Trayvon was wearing on the night he died.

Early on in the case the grey hoodie became a symbol of a movement to see justice 
done.

In October a campaign called the 
Halloween Hoodie Campaign was launched to encourage a stand against 
negative stereotypes by donning the same hoods.

'I'm
a black man, are you afraid of me now?' a YouTube video captures men 
and women of various races, including family of Trayvon, asking the 
camera as they cover themselves with a hood. 

Many famous faces have tweeted and  Instagramming images of themselves wearing hooded sweatshirts.

Yesterday a number of churches nationwide declared the day 'Hoodie Sunday' in honor of Trayvon Martin.

At New York City's Middle Collegiate 
Church in Manhattan, congregants wore hooded sweatshirts.

George Crump the family's attorney thanked all the protesters
nationwide who 'put their hoodies up and to everybody who said, 'I am 
Trayvon.'

George Zimmerman, 29, was acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the shooting death of 17 year old Trayvon Benjamin Martin.

A jury of six women took more than 16 hours and 20 minutes to come to come to their unanimous decision that the death was justifiable.

Zimmerman, who was a neighbourhood watch volunteer, was charged with second-degree murder for fatally shooting Martin on February 26, 2012.

Forceful: Thousands of protestors gathered in Times Square on Sunday night to demonstrate against the acquittal of George Zimmerman in Florida late Saturday. The march continued up 5th Avenue toward Harlem when arrests began

Massive: The crowd of pro-Trayvon Martin protestors swelled in Times Square, where they marched from Union Square on Sunday before continuing uptown

Blocked: With emotions high and traffic stopped, tensions rose as protestors blocked the Los Angeles freeway 

The court was told that he had followed the unarmed youngster through a park because he looked like he was 'up to no good.'

Zimmerman, a volunteer neighbourhood watchman, claims he shot Martin in self-defence, and that the teen punched him repeatedly before deciding to use lethal force.

Yesterday protests spread across the country in a second day of demonstrations in the wake of the sensational not-guilty verdict.

Demonstrations, from Florida where the trial took place to Atlanta, DC and New York, remained largely peaceful, though Los Angeles protesters managed to shut down an entire freeway and thousands of New Yorkers mobbed Times Square and blocked traffic for an hour.

Emotional crowds screamed 'Justice for Trayvon' and carried signs that likened the struggle of the slain teen and his supporters to that of the original civil rights movement.

Justice: Protestors scream a call for justice in the memory of slain teen Trayvon Martin during a July 14 march from Manhattan's Union Square to Times Square

'No justice': Atlanta, Georgia also saw hundreds gather Sunday to protest the verdict in George Zimmerman's trial

Enough protestors had gathered on foot in Los Angeles to shut down the city's 10 freeway.

With cars backed up in their wake, the mob chanted their rallying cry: 'Who's streets? Our street, our freeway.'

Police were unable to clear the roadway and allow traffic to pass until around 7pm and photos show a face-to-face clash between cops and protestors on the highway.

Elsewhere in Los Angeles, protestors have had confrontations with police, according to NBC4,  which reports that LAPD has fired rubber bullets into the crowd.

Bean bag rounds were also used to disperse the Los Angeles crowd and police said D cell batteries and rocks had been thrown at them.

As the night began to wear on in the City of Angels, protests became more serious.

An LAPD vehicle and a local news van were surrounded by angry Angelenos.

Some protestors climbed atop cars. Some of the cars were even moving, carrying the demonstrators down city streets toward Hollywood, where people would later fill and block the busy Hollywood and Highland Avenue intersection.

Five hundred chanting demonstrators had gathered in one of the the marches through Los Angeles streets by 10pm.
