Children in Australia and New Zealand were once amongst the most adventurous in the world, surfing, climbing, diving, racing and swimming in the huge natural playgrounds that their countries afforded them.

These days, one in four Australian children are overweight, as are 29 per cent of children in New Zealand, according to the Lancet Medical Journal.

A 59-year-old physicist, who was one of a bunch of daredevil children that pioneered adventure sports in the sixties by surfing the biggest waves, wrestling in mud, and rolling down hills in old tyres in New Zealand, believes it’s about time the nations stopped wrapping their children in 'cotton wool'.

'Myself and my brothers were raised in the wilderness and we developed that comfort zone with the outdoors. As opposed to kids today who are developing a comfort zone with the settee and their bedrooms,' Clive Neeson told Daily Mail Australia.

Pioneering: Clive Neeson strapped his $7 camera onto his surfboard to ride the biggest waves way before the invention of the popular GoPro camera in 2004

To prove his point, Mr Neeson has revealed 45-years of stunning footage of him and his adrenalin seeking friends playing with very few barriers to stop them learning, exploring and having fun outdoors.

Part of his motley crew was the man responsible for popularising the extreme sport of bungy jumping, AJ Hackett. Hackett famously jumped from the Eiffel Tower in 1987 and founded the first commercial bungy site in 1988.

Mr Neeson grew up in a time when parents let their children play outside for hours on end, without needing to contact them by mobile phone. A time when children wanted to be outdoors, rather than sat at home in front of a screen.

They had little money, but they gained a wealth of experiences.

'It was their mothers who insisted they play outside. They had no toys so there was a lot of innovation,' Mr Neeson explained. 

'Kids these days are wrapped in cotton wool and there are too many restrictions, all the way down to the backyards of homes, they are not free to play in parks any more. It's manifesting itself in adults as well - they are not playing out, they are working out,' he added.

No worries: The children were free to get as muddy as the liked in the great outdoors

His advice for parents?

'Take the kids camping and make sure it’s the happiest time they've ever had in the great outdoors.'

Mr Neeson believes that children not exploring outdoors is 'the biggest thing to threaten our civilisation'.

‘We can’t find scientists… all these problems, including obesity, are linked,’ he said.

Dr Arne Rubinstein, an expert on adolescent development, agrees with Mr Neeson: 'I strongly believe that the time for boys to learn boundaries and to experiment is when they are young.'

‘The outdoors is the perfect environment. If they wait to do it when they are adults using cars and other potential lethal devices then the consequences can be disastrous.

'We are failing a whole generation of children by wrapping them in cotton wool and not letting them get out there, get muddy, scratched up and bruised… it’s part of their basic education.'

Growing up, Neeson and his 'oddball friends' created an early version of snowboarding – grabbing some wood and sliding along the hilly slopes - windsurfing and hang gliding, long before their popularisation into main stream sports and filming it all along the way.

Skying: Mr Neeson's film, Last Paradise, shows how he and his friends embraced extreme sports

The filmmaker, one of four boys who were born in East Africa to wildlife cinematographer parents, has now spent $500,000 turning the videos he captured on his $7 camera into an award-winning feature film titled Last Paradise. 

Mr Neeson was doing some technical troubleshooting at Peter Jackson's studio in New Zealand during the making of Lord Of The Rings, when he used some of his own footage to test a machine.

People in the studio said it was the most 'extraordinary footage they'd ever seen' and thus Mr Neeson was spurred on to make his own flick.  

The nostalgic film, which is made up of 70 per cent of footage filmed by Neeson, shows the beginning of extreme sports in one of the most beautiful landscapes on earth and follows it through to what it is today.

The film also has a strong environmental thread and clearly documents the detriment of some of New Zealand and Australia’s greatest wildernesses.

'It's more than a film... I've had people email me and say "it's really changed my life", both their relationship with the wilderness and with their kids. 

Mr Neeson strapped his cameras to his surfboard and improvised snowboard – pioneering extreme action video photography - way before the invention of the pricey GoPro camera that was invented by an American man on a surfing trip in 2004.

'I built water housing for both of them and 1970s,' he said.

Touring: The filmmaker has taken his movie Last Paradise around Australia to 25 different cinemas

Passionate:  The film also has a strong environmental thread. 'all the beautiful places I loved as a child have gone,' Mr Neeson said

The film premiered last year in Perth, where Mr Neeson now spends half of his time, and toured 25 cinemas around Australia. 

Due to the overwhelming response he received Mr Neeson now plans to take the film back on the road to around 30 schools and towns and is inviting people who are interested in watching it to register their interest on the Last Paradise website.

‘If you’re interested we will organise the tour to come to you,’ he said.
