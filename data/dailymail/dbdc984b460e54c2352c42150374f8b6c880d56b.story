A council is investigating why swastikas are carved into the stonework of its offices after a member of the public spotted the masonry 75 years after the building was built.

A row of the infamous Nazi symbols adorn part of the stone façade above a door at Essex County Hall in Chelmsford, which was completed in 1939, the year the Second World War started.

A member of the public wrote to the council asking why it 'was still commissioned given the symbol's negative connotations.'

They added: 'It struck me as strange seeing as the Nazi party formed in 1933 and by March 1938 were beginning an invasion into Austria.

'It's potentially offensive and upsetting to those that lost loved ones in the war or those that fought for their country.' 

The council is dealing with the request for an explanation under the Freedom of Information Act.

A spokesman said: 'We will be responding in detail to the individual who has raised the questions before making any further comment.'

John Hammond of the Chelmsford Civic 
Society questioned why the request for an explanation was being made 75 
years after the building was constructed.

He said: 'I'm mystified as to why it's coming up now. Personally I think it would be overkill to remove the symbols.'

The swastika was used for thousands of years, including a Hindu symbol, before it was adopted by Hitler.

The Grade II-listed building was constructed between 1929 to 1939 - the decade of the Nazis' rise to power.

The hall 'strongly represents the civic pride and authority of a county council', according to English Heritage.

In addition to the controversial swastika carvings, the exterior is decorated with Corinthian columns and other details.

The building is particularly noted for its interior fixtures and fittings, including stained glass windows and murals by prominent local artists.

The swastika is an ancient symbol whose history stretched back for millennia before its meaning was perverted by Nazi ideology.

It is used to represent luck in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, and takes its name - meaning 'it is good' from the Sanskrit language in which the Hindu religious texts were written.

Many Hindus traditionally painted the swastika symbol over their doors during festivals in order to welcome the gods inside.

As well as Asian religions, the swastika has been a popular decorative motif in Greek, Roman, Celtic and Byzantine art, making it one of the most common symbols in human history.

However, in 1920 Adolf Hitler declared that the swastika - tilted 45 degrees - should be the official logo of his nascent Nazi Party.

When he came to power, he replaced the German flag with a swastika in a white circle on a red background, making the emblem a feared symbol of his murderous regime.

After the Second World War the Nazi swastika was outlawed in Germany, Poland, Hungary and Lithuania, although it is still permitted in a religious or scholarly context.
