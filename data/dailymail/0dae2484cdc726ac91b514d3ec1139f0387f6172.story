A little girl has died after suddenly falling unconscious at her nursery in south London.

The 22-month-old was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital after she stopped breathing while playing at the Dicky Birds nursery in Wimbledon, but later died.

The cause of death has not been revealed but Ofstead has suspended the nursery’s registration pending an investigation.

Rachel Berry, owner of Dicky Birds Nurseries, said her staff acted immediately according to protocol and were devastated to learn that the little girl had died.

She said: ‘Staff called an ambulance while administering CPR.

‘The child was taken to hospital in a critical condition.We were all devastated to learn that the child later died in hospital.

‘We are co-operating fully with the police and Ofsted to facilitate a thorough investigation.’

Metropolitan Police have confirmed that they are not investigating the incident which occurred at about 9.40am on August 23.

Although the nursery’s registration has been suspended for the time being, Ms Berry said it is the usual practice pending investigations.

Emergency: The girl was taken to nearby St George's Hospital where she later died

Ms Berry said: ‘It is standard procedure in this situation for the individual nursery’s Ofsted registration to be temporarily suspended.

‘We are working closely with Ofsted to have the suspension lifted as quickly as possible.

‘Our thoughts are with the parents and family of the child, who have asked for complete anonymity at this incredibly painful time.’

An Ofsted spokesman said: ‘Ofsted is aware of the tragic death of a child at Dicky Birds nursery in Wimbledon and we are working closely with the nursery and other agencies to support their investigations.

‘The nursery’s registration has been suspended while the circumstances are investigated and it would be inappropriate to make any further comment at this stage.’

A Merton Council spokesman said: ‘Out of respect for the wishes of the family we can only confirm that a child has died following an incident at a Wimbledon nursery.

‘The event is being investigated by the appropriate agencies. Our thoughts are with the family at this very difficult time’

A Metropolitan Police spokesman confirmed a postmortem examination was conducted at St George’s Hospital mortuary but did not give any further details.
