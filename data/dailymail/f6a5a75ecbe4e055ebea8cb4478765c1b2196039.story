While some viewers of last night's Emmy Awards were impressed by the glamorous dresses on display on the red carpet, others were alarmed at how far the celebrities had gone to squeeze into them.

Breaking Bad's Anna Gunn won the gong for best supporting actress in a drama series but many viewers didn't focus on her win but on her gaunt appearance on the red carpet.

The 45-year-old looked noticeably skinnier than when at last year's event as her shoulders protruded and her collar bone jutted out as she wore her sleeveless Romona Keveza gown.

Thinner: Viewers expressed concern over Anna Gunn's bony figure at the Emmys

Year on: The actress had a fuller figure and a less protruding collar bone at last year's Emmys, right

One viewer Tweeted: 'Am I the only person in the twitter verse that thought Anna Gunn looked like she was starving?'

Another wrote: 'Woah, Anna Gunn is so skinny... What happened?'

Referring to her character's name, another said: 'Skyler looked so skinny at the Emmys.'

Gunn wasn't the only actress at the Emmys who viewers thought looked worryingly thin.

Best supporting actress: The actress's arms and shoulders looked skinny as she celebrated her victory with co-star Aaron Paul

Skeletal the new skinny? Like Anna, Claire Danes looked slim and flat-chested, right, even though she recently became a mother

Homeland
 actress Claire Danes and Game of Thrones star Emilia Clarke were also among
 those displaying ultra-skinny figures and jutting collar bones.

Modern
 Family actress Julie Bowen admitted she had 'starved' herself to get 
into her tightly fitted dress with a fish tail. And it was clear she 
wasn't joking about skipping a meal or two by her bony neck and 
shoulders.

Meanwhile, nobody would have 
guessed Danes had given birth to her son just nine months ago as she 
revealed a flat chest and slim stomach in a plunging dress that exposed 
her tiny neck and gaunt shoulders.

Britain's Cat Deeley looked a shade of her former self as she blended in with the skinny stars with her leaner frame.

The red carpet display of skeletal women caused Fox News to ask in their report of the awards, is skeleton the new skinny?

They noted how the emaciated frames 
caused concern for many viewers who expressed their views via social 
networks. Many feared impressionable youngsters could use them as their 
'thinspiration' and try to emulate their size 0 figures.

One said that Bowen's starving comment was 'refreshingly honest but sad nevertheless,' while another Tweeted, 'Julie Bowen talking about starving to fit into her dress. Nice message about body image.'

Another said: 'Claire Danes is WAY too skinny. Not feelin it'.

Referring to E! presenter Giuliana Rancic, another wrote: 'Funny thing about awards shows. You see what "too skinny" really looks like. Thanks, Giuliana. Eat some ice cream. Or anything.'

In agreement, another viewer said: 'Guilianna needs a filling meal' while another mused: 'Is it just me or are all of these women incredibly and awkwardly skinny? Lots of skin and bones at the 65th #Emmys tonight.'

Skeletal: Actress Julianna Margulies was another slim celeb with a jutting collar bone, left, while Allison Williams' figure was so slight her dress looked too big and hung off her

One male viewer pointed out: 'Attention all women: Most men do not like rail thin women. Please eat a cheeseburger. Trust me, it's OK.'

Style expert Michael Cohen told Fox News that recent fashion week trends seen on the catwalks in New York, London and Milan were to blame for the displays of stick-thin figures.

He said: 'There was a lot of bone showing dresses this year but that shouldn't be any surprise because that's what was on the fashion runways and that's what stylists turn to when dressing celebrities for the red carpet.

Thank heavens for the Mad Men girls: Christina Hendricks, left, and Elisabeth Moss bucked the skeletal trend

'Unfortunately, it doesn't always translate to a desirable red carpet look as in this years Emmy's, but then again this is the entertainment business which is supposed to be salacious.'

Thankfully not all the stars had succumbed to the skeletal trend. Mad Men's Christina Hendricks looked beautiful showcasing her famous curves in a black dress while her co-star Elisabeth Moss look radiant and healthy.
