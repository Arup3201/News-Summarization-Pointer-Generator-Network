‘Have you met the Queen? She rides a lot. She should come here and ride with me!’ Mzee’s eyes brightened at the prospect.

‘She likes polo too!’ he added gleefully. ‘We don’t get to do enough of that here!’ But for Mzee – real name David – there’s no shortage of excitement to be found closer to home in southern Kenya’s picturesque Chyulu Hills.

While polo might be an occasional treat for him, a bigger treat for me was just around the next acacia bush. ‘Look, look!’ he hissed, standing up in his stirrups.

Crashing through the underbrush, its broad grey back seemingly impervious to the spiny shrubs, was an enormous elephant. There was nothing but a short stretch of scrubby grass between it and me.

A 100km stretch of volcanic mountains bisected by broad, grassy plains studded with thorny acacia trees, the Chyulu Hills might be a national park but they’re barely known compared to the mighty Masaai Mara to the west and the wildlife-packed Tsavo to the east.

As a result, you’re never likely see hordes of vehicles converge on a sighting, if, indeed, you see anyone else at all.

What you will find, however, are animals and plenty of them. Within seconds of stepping off the little bush plane that ferried us down to Chyulu from Nairobi’s international airport, we’d spotted a couple of honking wildebeest, a twitchy group of oryx and a dazzle – yes, that is the proper name – of peacefully grazing zebra.

Sundowner with a difference: A group of local Maasai troop down the hill to dance for visitors at ol Donyo Lodge

But while seeing them from a game vehicle is fun, nothing beats getting up close and personal from the back of a horse.

Mine was named Mawingu, a word that means cloud in the local Maa language and given to him on account of his pristine cream-coloured hide.

We got along from the start, his nippy turn of pace and eagle eye for thorny bushes dovetailing neatly with my own plans: to see as much of the local wildlife as possible, while beating the zebras at their own game as they galloped across the savannah.

With me was Mzee, given the Swahili honorific meaning grandfather by the younger men, and a chap who certainly knows his stuff when it comes to wildlife.

Stunning: The lovely ol Donyo Lodge is run by the charming (and very funny) Ray and Alyssa

Striking: During the Great Migration, more than a million wildebeest and zebra stream into the Masai Mara

‘You see 
that?’ he’d ask as my much-younger eyes tried and failed to pick out a 
black-backed jackal scurrying along in the distance. ‘You see?’ 
Sometimes I did, quite often I didn’t.

What
 I did see a lot of were elephants, many of which came daily to drink 
from the watering hole in front of ol Donyo Lodge where I stayed.

A
 quirky mix of modern cool and Masaai detail, the lodge sits on a huge 
private reservation and boasts its own stables, as well as entertainment
 in the shape of managers Ray and Alyssa and their lovely staff.

My room was vast – easily as big as the average London flat and with a private deck, complete with a personal pool.

From
 here, I watched as the local giraffes and elephants trudged to and from
 the water, scattering smaller game as they made their way through the 
trees.

Enjoying the view: Along with wildebeest, a balloon ride is a good way to see buffalo and gazelle

Adorable: Daniel unearthed a cute dik dik antelope within 15 minutes of beginning the search

It would have been easy to stay put by that pool but Mawingu was waiting as was Ol’ Donyo’s other big natural attraction – a set of enormous fossilised lava tubes.

Perched high on a hilltop, 30 minutes of rugged safari track and regular game sightings away, seeing Ol Donyo’s lava tubes requires sensible shoes – ideally not the suede loafers I had on – and nerves of steel.

Down a steep track littered with rocks you go, dodging rock fig roots and keeping a safe distance from the local bats as you do. Inside, the tunnels are dark and vast, massive burned black walls, fractured with streaks of red sandstone.

It feels a bit like being in your own Indiana Jones film, albeit that the treasure at the end is emerging, blinking into the light to find sundowners and ‘bities’ waiting for you.

Bities, or small canapes, are one of the highlights of a Kenyan safari and Ol Donyo does them especially well.

Banana and bacon bites, salty macadamia nuts and tiny goat’s cheese toasts all go down well after a hike deep into a lava tube.

Delicious though they were, they tasted best following a sweaty gallop across the plain below with Mawingu and Mzee.

On my first horseback safari, I found myself getting unexpectedly close to the natives: sitting quietly as a giraffe passed within feet of us, watching as a jackal – most of which dash off at the first rumbling of a car engine – edged closer, and freezing as an elephant ventured by.

Adorable: The Masai Mara is crammed with wildlife, among them the Big Five, hippos and cheetah

‘If it 
charges at us, we’ll gallop away,’ said Mzee, reassuringly, although we 
never had to. Lions and other big cats are few and far between in the 
Chyulu Hills, not so good for first time visitors to Kenya but better 
for those who want to ride.

And in any case, there were plenty where we were going next: The mighty Masaai Mara.

Lion, cheetah, leopard, hippo, elephant, giraffe and many more, you don’t have to go far to see something.

With a Masaai guide like Daniel, the fantastically knowledgeable man in charge of our party, it takes minutes.

‘What do you want to see?’ he asked as we clambered into the car. I 
wanted to see a dik dik – an adorably tiny antelope with huge Bambi 
eyes.

Heavenly: Sundowners with Mara Encounter Maasai guide Daniel came with a spectacular view

By the time we reached Encounter Mara, an open tented camp run by a cheerful South African named Colin and his Kenyan wife Chala, we’d seen one.

While you fall asleep to the quiet sound of giraffes brushing through the bushes at Ol Donyo, at Mara Encounter, it’s to the huffing noise of hunting lions and the honking of their prey – wildebeest.

It was the same story again at Mara Toto, a tiny tented camp close to the Mara River where each year, millions of wildebeest and zebra pile through the water en masse during the Great Migration.

Although we didn’t see a crossing, we did get up early for a balloon flight that gave some sense of the scale of it.

Below our silent vehicle, scores of wildebeest dotted the plain like black ants spilling from a termite mound, albeit much noisier. It was a truly incredible sight.

But much in Kenya is incredible. From the bright pink flamingos of Lake Nakuru to the gorgeous Indian Ocean beaches of the coast where I ended my trip, it’s hard not to fall in love with the place.

Perfect finish: The trip ended with a few days spent relaxing on a gorgeous Indian Ocean beach in Watamu

Sitting in a deckchair at the gorgeous Medina Palms, an idyllic bolthole perched on a sugar sand beach in Watamu, I didn’t want to leave.

But it was the Chyulu Hills that proved the real eye opener. Hidden away in a corner of the country rarely visited by foreign tourists, overshadowed by the mighty Mount Kilimanjaro and home to some of the most beautiful beasts on the planet, the national park is a real hidden gem.

Much like Mzee in fact. Perhaps he really will get to play polo with the Queen one day. In the meantime, he’ll have to settle for watching the elephants go by with me.
