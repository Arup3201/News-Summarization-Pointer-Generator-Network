Harry Kane will make the final decision on whether to play in this summer’s European Under 21 championship after talks with Gareth Southgate.

Kane, who scored on his debut for England against Lithuania, will start in the friendly against Italy in Turin on Tuesday.

The Tottenham forward, who has 19 goals in the Premier League this season, has been told to consider his options by club boss Mauricio Pochettino.

Kane has intimated he wants to take part in the tournament and Under 21 manager Southgate wants him in the squad. Kane has represented England at Under 17, Under 19, Under 20, Under 21 and now senior level, and the FA want him to be an example for all young players.

England head coach Roy Hodgson has excused him from this summer’s friendly with Ireland on June 7 and the Euro 2016 qualifier with Slovenia on June 14.

He travels with Tottenham to Kuala Lumpur to play Malaysia in a friendly on May 27 before they move on to Australia. Kane, 21, is then expected to join up with Southgate’s squad for the Under 21 Euro Championship but Spurs are warning him about burn-out.
