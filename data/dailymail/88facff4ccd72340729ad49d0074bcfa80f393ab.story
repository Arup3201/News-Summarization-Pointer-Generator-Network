A writer claims he was almost involved in a mid-air collision two weeks ago that could have been one of the deadliest air accidents ever.

Kevin Townsend was flying from Hawaii to Los Angeles when he says his plane almost collided with another.

He estimates that 590 could have died if the pilot hadn't veered out of the way of the on-coming jet, yet the near-miss hasn't made the news.

In an essay for Medium, Townsend argues that it's events like his flight last month that prove the airline industry is desperately in need or more oversight.

Dip: Usually a flight's tracker should be flat once reaching cruising altitude, but you can see the point at which the plane dipped 600 feet in the above graph around the 1:15pm point

Shortly after reaching cruising altitude on April 25, the entire cabin of United Airlines flight 1205 went weightless as the pilot unexpectedly dipped 600 feet.

'I felt my body float upwards and strain against my seatbelt. Passengers around me screamed. There was a loud crash in the back — a coffeepot clattering to the floor and tumbling down the aisle,' Townsend wrote.

'Our tray tables began rattling in unison as the 757 strained through the kind of maneuver meant more for a fighter jet.'

After a few minutes, a flustered flight attendant came over the intercom and said: 'OK. That was obviously unexpected.'

Once the plane climbed back up to cruising altitude the flight attendant explained that 'the pilot took evasive action to avoid an aircraft in our flight path' and that everyone's in-flight entertainment would be comped for the flight.

Safely on the ground on Los Angeles, Townsend interviewed the flight and began his own research into what really happened and how air traffic is controlled.

On a road, cars stay out of each others way by driving in different lanes, but that doesn't work in the air. Instead westbound flights fly at even altitudes while eastbound flights fly at odd altitudes.

Townsend's flight to LA was flying at 33,000 feet, meaning they were in the right and the oncoming plane was in the wrong 'lane' so to speak.

Protocol: When two airplane are about to collide, systems on board send out an alarm and give orders for each plane to either dive or climb

Moments from crashing: But by the time the United pilot received the alarm on April 25, he could already see the plane ahead of him and had to act quicker

Shortly after reaching cruising altitude, an alarm went off in the cockpit, alerting the pilots that they were in the direct path of another flight.

When this happens, the two planes are given orders to either dive or climb so as to get out of each others air space.

But by the time the pilot received the alarm in this case, the oncoming plane was dangerously close - close enough to see coming head on. Planes going 600mph can close a distance of 5 miles in 15 seconds meaning they were mere moments away from collision.

'Holy s***, there it is!' the pilot exclaimed, and immediately took the plane into a dive.

'The first officer later told me the US Airways flight was “certainly too close for comfort."'Townsend said.

After researching past collisions, Townsend discovered that the April near-miss could have been the most disastrous in history.

Currently, the most deadly airplane collision is the Tenerife Airport Disaster of 1977, which claimed 583 lives when two 747s collided.

Epic proportions: The deadliest aircraft collision happened at Tenerife Airport in 1977 and claimed 583 lives. Townsend estimates that 590 would have been killed if his plane collided over the Pacific last month

Last month, Townsend was on board a 757-300, the longest narrow-body twin jet ever made, with 289 on board. Since they were traveling over the Pacific the other plane was most likely similarly large.

'Had there been a collision, it would have been the new record, with an estimated 590 deaths, one of them mine,' Townsend said.

But the story still hasn't been reported in the news because of the way airlines self-govern themselves.

When an incident happens in the air outside of air traffic control, it's up to the pilot to report incident.

It wasm't until two weeks after the accident that the FAA finally found out about the incident and said it was being investigated, both internally by the airline and by the Air Traffic Organization.

However, an FAA inspector in Hawaii told Townsend that nothing was likely to come from the investigation because everything on the planes seemed to work properly.

Townsend finds this ludicrous and compares it to driving a car on a road at night when suddenly you see another car coming at you in the wrong land.

'You swerve into another lane just as the car passes. The FAA’s view would hold that nothing was amiss because your headlights revealed the oncoming car,' he explains.

In the essay, Townsend calls for more oversight of the airline companies and believes they should collect better data and be more open with sharing their findings.
