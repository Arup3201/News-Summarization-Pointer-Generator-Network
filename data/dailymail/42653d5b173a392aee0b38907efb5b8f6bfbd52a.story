Liverpool midfielder Raheem Sterling has admitted that the club are badly missing the talents of striker Daniel Sturridge to help propel them back up the Premier League table.

Sturridge has not featured for the Reds since picking up a thigh injury while on international duty at the start of September.

The England striker's last game for Liverpool was their 3-0 win at Tottenham at the end of August, with the club having lost their last two games since.

Defeats against Aston Villa and West Ham have seen the club slip down  to 11th in the league and Sterling, who scored in their 3-1 loss at Upton Park on Saturday, says the return of the 25-year-old can't come soon enough.

'Daniel is a massive miss for us with his goals and the way he plays in behind defenders,' Sterling told Liverpool's official club website.

'Him coming back should add another dimension to the team. It will definitely be a test of character but I think there is a lot of character in this group.'
