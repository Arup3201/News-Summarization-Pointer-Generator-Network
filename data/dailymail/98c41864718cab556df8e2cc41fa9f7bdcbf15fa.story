A teen who lost her hair while battling a rare form of kidney cancer was surprised by a celebrity hairstylist who arrived on her doorstep to gift her a new wig and a complete makeover just hours before her senior prom.

When doctors told 18-year-old Hannah Tate from Maryville, Tennessee, she was well enough to attend her prom, she took to Instagram to get in touch with hairstylist Tokyo Stylez, who has worked with Rihanna, Naomi Campbell, and Gabrielle Union, in the hopes that he would send her one of his custom-made wigs.

But Tokyo took his generosity one step further and secretly began working with Hannah's mother LaVetta Spann in order to personally deliver and style the wig before the Alcoa High School dance.

Unforgettable moment: Hannah Tate, who is battling a rare kidney cancer, posed for a pre-prom photo after a celebrity hairstylist gave her a complete makeover before the high school dance last Saturday

So grateful: The next day, the 18-year-old, who goes by the Twitter name Molly Copeland, took to Twitter to thank everyone who had helped her get to her senior prom 

Hannah was diagnosed with cancer last November and lost her hair after chemotherapy and radiation treatments.

She spent most of her senior year of high school undergoing treatment at St. Jude Regional Children’s Hospital in Memphis and missed out on basketball games, track meets, and dance competitions.

But she was thrilled that she was able to go to her senior prom with all of her friends.

And while Hannah had been expecting a package containing a wig to arrive at her house last Saturday afternoon, she was shocked when she opened her door and saw Tokyo and his glam squad.

'It took me a second to realize it was him at first, like to actually believe it,' she told WATE.com.  

Tokyo and his team gave Hannah the star treatment, including make-up and hair styling, before her big night.  

'She teared up and cried a little bit. I didn’t want her to because I didn’t want to cry,' Tokyo told the outlet.

He added: 'It’s like a once in a lifetime thing. You only go to your senior prom once, so to be a part of it is something that she’ll always remember.'

Hannah's new wig was styled in long waves that tumbled over her shoulders, and she donned a floor-length gown featuring a crystal-covered black halter bodice and a flowing white skirt.

'She just wanted to be beautiful for her prom night and to show her friends and her family that she’s still that beautiful girl that they once knew,' Tokyo's business manager Christopher Aaron told WATE.com.

The next day Hannah took to Intstagram to share a snapshot of her prom look and thank Tokyo and his team, as well as her mother and doctors, for her fantastic night. 

'Prom was amazing last night! First thanking, God for even blessing me to be able to go!' she wrote.

Yesterday, Tokyo also posted an Instagram photo of himself with Hannah, writing: 'So blessed to have met such a strong, brave individual. 

'I hope I made this moment as special as it was to have met you.'
