Texas land commissioner candidate George P. Bush, the son of former Florida governor Jeb Bush, has become a father.

Spokesman Trey Newton said Bush and his wife, Amanda, had their first child, a boy named Prescott Walker Bush, on Monday afternoon.

George P. Bush is the grandson of former President George H.W. Bush. Another former president, George W. Bush, is his uncle.

The new father tweeted out a picture of the swaddled baby boy in his arms on Monday evening.

'So proud to announce the birth of our son Prescott Walker Bush,' he wrote, adding, '"Little P" for short.'

Jeb Bush later tweeted out the same picture and wrote, 'Joyous day! Mom [and] baby doing well! A blessing from God.'

In April, George P. Bush's cousin and former first daughter Jenna Bush Hager gave birth to a daughter, Margaret 'Mila' Hager.

Spokesman Trey Newton said the baby is a third-generation Texan and joked that 'George P. looks forward to his son carrying on his tradition of playing baseball for the Rice Owls.'

A Spanish-speaking attorney and consultant based in Fort Worth, Bush is considered a rising star among conservative Hispanics.

Long active in politics, Bush announced in March he was running for land commissioner, which administers state-owned lands and mineral resources.
