As British drug courier Lindsay Sandiford lingers in a Bali prison under sentence of death, an Indonesian father who raped his nine-year-old daughter, causing her grievous injuries from which she died, received just 15 years jail today.            

British grandmother Mrs Sandiford, 56, was sentenced to death after being caught with £1.6 million of cocaine at Bali airport last year, despite helping police by naming four others she said were in the smuggling syndicate.            

By comparison, a 54-year-old man, named only as Sunoto, has received a reduced and relatively light sentence for the brutal rape of his daughter, infecting her with a sexually transmitted disease and causing such severe injuries that she later died in hospital.   

British grandmother Lindsay Sandiford, 56, pictured earlier this year, remains behind bars at a prison in Bali, a province in Indonesia, under a sentence of death for drug smuggling while a father who raped his nine-year-old daughter so viciously she later died in hospital from her injuries received just 15 years

The prosecution had demanded the man be sent away for 18 years but female Chief Judge Sabarulina Ginting, sitting in the East Jakarta District Court, decided on just 15 years.                  

In addition to the lenient jail sentence, Sunoto was fined just £25.

The court heard that Sunoto was named a suspect not long after his daughter, identified only by the initial R, died at Persahabatan Hospital in East Jakarta on January 6 following two weeks of intense medical attention.            

The Jakarta Post reported that her doctors said she had suffered from brain inflammation and sustained injuries from a blunt object being inserted into her.            

The doctors also said she had been infected with a sexually transmitted disease.

Police told the court that Sunoto admitted raping R in October of last year at their house in East Jakarta.            

But the father managed to tell reporters after the verdict that he had never raped his daughter, insisting he confessed his guilt to police only in order to protect his family.            

'I never did that,' he said. 'I made the confession just so that this can be over quickly and so that police would no longer summon my family,' he said.            

Just 24 hours earlier it emerged from the neighbouring country of Papua New Guinea that an 18-year-old girl who had been raped by her father killed him by chopping off his head with a bush knife.           

Police said yesterday they were determined to question the girl, even though villagers said they had formed a protective ring around her because she had 'done the right thing' by killing her 'evil' father.
