A volunteer swimming coach who has spent 51 years teaching children may lose her job after she claims she was wrongly convicted of assaulting a girl.

Janet Hewitt, who was last year introduced to Prince Charles during a royal visit to the pool where she works, dedicated 40 hours a week to coaching, but says she is ‘devastated’ she may face a ban.

The 69-year-old grandmother was accused of grabbing a ten-year-old by the arm and shouting at her to get changed after a swimming gala.

Janet meeting Prince Charles in June 2012 when he visited Dorchester swimming pool. Last year scores of past and present pupils and parents held a surprise celebration for her to mark her 50th year of coaching

She is said to have bruised the victim’s upper arm in the process.

Mrs Hewitt denied the accusation and insisted the girl had run into her, a version backed up by a witness.

But she was charged with assault and found guilty after a trial.

Magistrates described the case as a ‘very sad occasion’ and handed her a six-month conditional discharge, the lowest sentence available to them.

Her solicitor said Mrs Hewitt may no longer be able to volunteer with children and could also lose her job as a swimming coach.

Mrs Hewitt, from Dorchester, Dorset, said: ‘I am devastated that after 51 years of teaching, anybody could ever think I could hurt a child.

‘Coaching children to swim to their full potential is my life. I am teaching the grandchildren of people I taught 50 years ago.

‘I have taught thousands of children, some of whom have gone on to represent Britain.

‘I didn’t touch that child. I was [kneeling] down and she bumped into me. She knocked me over.

‘I held on to a locker to pull myself up and then the mother accused me of grabbing hold of the girl’s arm. I didn’t do it.

‘Four days after it is said to have happened, I got a phone call asking me to go to Weymouth police station.

Janet Hewitt, 69, faces being banned from teaching the sport she has volunteered 40 hours a week towards following the controversial case

‘That was the first I was aware of the allegation. My solicitor said afterwards that there wasn’t a charge here. Ten days later I was asked to go back to the station and was told they had enough to charge me with assault.

‘It is crazy that the case went as far as it did. It was one word against another. My solicitor said I didn’t have anything to worry about and all along I just thought “when will common sense prevail?”’

Magistrates in Weymouth heard that Mrs Hewitt had been in the changing rooms at the Dorchester Sports Centre when the incident took place.

The girl, who cannot be named for 
legal reasons, said she was walking away from the showers to the 
changing rooms when she passed Mrs Hewitt.

The conviction means Mrs Hewitt will no longer be able to volunteer with children or vulnerable adults

She said: ‘She grabbed me by the arm.
She shouted really loudly and in my face and it hurt my arm. She 
bellowed that I have three seconds to get changed.’

The incident was witnessed by the girl’s mother, who said her daughter was ‘like a rabbit in the headlights’.

The mother added: ‘I marched over and told Janet to stop it. I was very shocked and upset.’

In her police interview, Mrs Hewitt denied touching the victim. She said: ‘I think the mum would not have been able to see clearly. I do not think they were wrong, but they might have been mistaken.’

Another witness, aged 13, said she saw the victim come around the corner and bump into Mrs Hewitt, but had not seen any other physical contact.

Lee Christmas, defending, said the conviction means Mrs Hewitt will no longer be able to volunteer with children or vulnerable adults.

Magistrate Harry Barnes said: ‘It is a very sad occasion in many respects.

‘Your record of all you have done for young people and disabled people is something I dare say has not been seen anywhere else.’
