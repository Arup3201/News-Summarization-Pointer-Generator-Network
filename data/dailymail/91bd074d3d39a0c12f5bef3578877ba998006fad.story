It was the ambitious dream of a five-year-old cancer patient: to become a real-life superhero.

And thousands of Americans – including President Barack Obama – rallied to make it happen, giving Miles Scott an unforgettable day as ‘Batkid’.

About 10,000 people flanked the streets of San Francisco, as it  transformed into Gotham City for the day, allowing Miles to defeat Batman’s nemeses The Penguin and The Riddler.

Our hero: Thousands of Americans hailed Batkid as cancer patient Miles Scott lives his dream

The pint-sized superhero sped around in a Batmobile – with a police motorcycle escort and news helicopters circling overhead – as he vanquished crime. Batkid Saves City, screamed the headlines on a special edition of The San Francisco – or rather Gotham City – Chronicle.

And President Obama sent a taped message from the White House saying: ‘Way to go, Miles. Way to save Gotham!’

At the end of the day, Mayor Ed Lee presented Miles with a giant chocolate key to the city as a huge, cheering crowd gathered outside City Hall.

The massive effort came after Miles’s mother Natalie, from Oregon, wrote to the Make-A-Wish Foundation saying her ailing son dreamed of being a mini crimefighter. And the youngster thought he was visiting San Francisco to pick up a Batman costume when the action started happening on Friday.

Police Chief Greg Suhr, who recorded mayday messages to set Batkid on his missions, said: ‘This is one of those days which makes me so proud.

‘It has turned into a full-blown phenomenon. 

‘Everyone joined together to make this young boy’s dream come true.’

Among those joining in was the US Attorney’s Office, which issued a formal ‘indictment’ against the Riddler and Penguin ‘for their all too familiar villainous ways in Gotham City’ adding: ‘Somehow they thought these latest stunts would go undetected by Batkid.’

Miles’s mother Natalie said: ‘It was a day he will remember forever. People were lining the streets. I have been in tears from the outpouring of love, kindness and humanity that has been shown to my son.’ In real life, Miles has defeated an enemy more deadly than any supervillain.

He has been fighting leukaemia since he was 18 months old, but he underwent his final surgery last month, and the cancer is now in remission.

‘This day has meant an end to over three years of putting toxic drugs in our son’s body,’ Mrs Scott added.

‘He is our superhero.’

Eric Johnson, who accompanied Miles dressed as Batman, said: ‘He’s an excellent superhero. He’s a totally mild-mannered kid when the mask is off. But when he puts on the Batsuit he’s uncontainable.’
