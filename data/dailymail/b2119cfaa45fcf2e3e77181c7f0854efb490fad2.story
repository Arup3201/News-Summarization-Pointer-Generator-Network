Taking sugary snacks off supermarket checkouts could help combat child obesity, a leading scientist has suggested.

Lord Krebs said the rise in the number of people who are overweight and obese in recent years was ‘staggering’ and required tougher intervention than just encouraging healthy eating.

The incoming president of the British Science Association president and former chair of the Food Standards Agency said having an array of sweet treats at children's eye-level at supermarket checkouts was ‘totally inappropriate’.

The peer said soft policy ‘nudges’ would not solve the obesity crisis alone, and called for tougher restrictions on food marketing and advertising.

He praised a recent move in Australia to only sell cigarettes in plain packaging and proposals to sell them only under the counter, saying smoking and obesity required tough regulation.

‘In the case of obesity [we need] more regulation of the food industry to prevent them in their quest, in which they are immensely successful, of distilling fat, salt and sugar into perfect little gems we are all happy to eat’, he told the British Science Festival in Aberdeen.

‘They are very good at promoting it particularly to children. When I was shopping at Marks & Spencer in the centre of Oxford I was completely struck by, at this level above the ground, all the little kiddies’ sweeties lined up there.

‘It’s clearly totally inappropriate for businesses to be able to do that. It’s directly marketing to three year old kids things that they shouldn’t be encouraged to eat large quantities of.’

In a speech today he will say there is ‘no magic bullet’ for tackling obesity, but scientists were generally agreed that while exercise is important, reducing calorie intake is the best way to lose weight.

Low level intervention such as information about healthy eating; and what he called middle-rung measures including publishing salt and fat content on packets would not be enough, he said.

One Government initiative known as the Great Swapathon involved encouraging people to buy healthier products such as fruit and vegetables with supermarket discount vouchers.

However he said there was evidence that families simply used the money they saved to buy more unhealthy food.

He said: ‘The Swapathon is part of the Government's wider initiative of inviting the food industry to help to tackle obesity on a voluntary basis.

‘The problem with this, as a food industry director said to the Select Committee, 'any business is in business to make money and opportunities to influence behaviour will be taken if they are a means to selling more products'.’

The Government has set up a Behavioural Insights Team - also known as the ‘Nudge Unit’ - to find ways of discreetly altering human behaviour by persuasion such as paying fines on time.

But Lord Krebs that this kind of policy was not strong enough to address major problems such as obesity or unsustainable consumption which required ‘a shove rather than a nudge’.

During his chairmanship of the Food Standards Agency, Krebs criticised the organic food movement, saying that people buying such food were 'not getting value for money.’

Yesterday he said the rate of overweight and obese children had doubled in two decades, with major implications for health which would put a huge burden on the healthcare system.

He said: ‘It is easy to describe the cause of obesity.   We live in an environment in which delicious, affordable calories are more readily available and in which our lifestyles have become more sedentary than ever before in our evolutionary history, and our body’s inbuilt regulatory mechanisms are simply not equipped to cope.

‘It is much less easy to see how whole populations, not just in this country, but all over the globe, can be persuaded to change their behavior by eating less and/or exercising more… the central challenge is to find ways of getting populations as a whole to change their behaviour. ‘
