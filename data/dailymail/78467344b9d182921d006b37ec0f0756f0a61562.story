A gang who attempted to flood Britain with £60 million worth of drugs hidden in foil takeaway cartons have been jailed for a total of 88 years.

The five men used a Worcestershire farm as a front for smuggling cannabis, amphetamines and MDMA from the Netherlands into the UK before selling them on to gangs from across the country.

When police raided the farm in Kempsey they discovered the gang had concealed the drugs in takeaway containers before sending them to haulage yards in the West Midlands and Worcestershire.

Once there the drugs were separated and collected by organised crime groups from across the UK.

The huge criminal enterprise was uncovered in July last year as part of Operation Gaul, a joint investigation by Warwickshire Police and West Mercia Police.

Among other items officers discovered around 50 takeaway trays filled with amphetamines at a haulage yard in Walsall.

Officers seized £13.5 million worth of drugs, including more than 1,000kg of cannabis, 107kg of MDMA and 64kg of amphetamines.

A court heard the haulage yard had been duped into handling the pallets and had no knowledge of what was inside them.

On Friday the gang were jailed at Birmingham Crown Court for a combined total of 88 years and 10 months after pleading guilty to conspiracy to import drugs.

Robert Scott, 67, of Worcester, was jailed for 20 years and Robert Whitehouse, 68, of Bromsgrove, was jailed 22 years and six months.

Peter Hillback, 42, of Cheslyn Hay, Staffordshire, was jailed for 14 years and four months and Jacobus Martinus Samson, 64, of Beek Ubbergen, in the Netherlands, was jailed for 20 years.

Richard Dale, 51, of Walsall, West Midlands, was jailed for 12 years after he was found guilty of conspiracy to import drugs following a trial in September.

Detective Inspector Carl Moore from Warwickshire Police, said: 'The sentences handed out should serve as a significant deterrent to anyone involved in criminality of this kind.'

Kiernan Cunningham, senior prosecutor from West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service's complex casework unit, said: 'These individuals have today been sentenced for their part in an organised criminal empire which was built on human pain and suffering.

'By all of their illegal actions these defendants were intending to add to that pain and suffering.'

Nigel Powell, 52, and Stephen Jones, 54, both of Ross-on-Wye in Herefordshire, will be sentenced next month after they were found guilty of conspiracy to supply drugs. 

West Mercia Police confirmed the gang had successfully smuggled £46.5 million worth of drugs into the UK between October 2012 and February 2014 before they were caught.

A force spokeswoman said: 'We conducted multiple seizures between October 2012 and February 2014.

'In our investigation, we estimate that during this time they would have smuggled in about £60 million worth of drugs in total.'
