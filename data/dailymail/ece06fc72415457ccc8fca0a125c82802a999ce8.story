A heartless mum who abandoned her twin eight-month-old babies so she could get a job in Britain has been arrested by police in Romania.

Mihaela Boghian, 32, left blue-eyed sisters Antonia and Iasmina in the corridor of a council apartment block in the city of Piatra Neamt in north-eastern Romania.

She then went to an employment agency and signed up to work as a fruit picker in the UK. 

Little Antonia and Iasmina were the centre of a nationwide appeal after being abandoned in the corridor of an apartment block by their mother who had disappeared to the United Kingdom

While she waited for the paperwork to go through, the mother ignored a nationwide appeal for little girls' parents to come forward.

The girls were only identified when their dad Marius Boghian, 35, spotted their faces on a television appeal and called police.

Mr Boghian, who works on a building site in Germany and is estranged from his wife, said he had believed that his children were being well-looked after by their mother.

He added: 'I always watched the news in Romania online on my mobile phone, and I was shocked when I saw pictures of the two babies found in my hometown and then when I looked more closely I realised they were my daughters.

'At first I couldn't believe it but when I tried to reach my estranged wife and couldn't, I contacted police and they were able to then confirm that they were my girls.

'I'd thought my beautiful girls were safe with their mother.'

The girls' father travelled to Romania where he was reunited with his daughters. The babies will stay with their dad under the supervision of social workers until an investigation has been completed.

But Mrs Boghian now insists that she made a terrible mistake and has asked to be reunited with her young daughters.

Romanian police spokesman Alin Diaconescu said: 'She had been left to look after the children while her estranged husband was in Germany. 

'But she was not satisfied with the amount of money he was sending back in child maintenance and felt trapped by having to look after the kids, so she had simply decided to abandon them. 

'She managed to get into an apartment block and dumped them in a corridor on the sixth floor. 

'They were found by a local resident in the apartment block who raised the alarm.'

The twins' mother only contacted police after she realised their father had come forward. 

Speaking to local TV she said: 'I never meant to hurt them. We had no money and I wanted to go abroad to earn some.

'I thought a children's home could look after them better than I could, and I couldn't face all the questions so I just left them where it was warm and I was sure they would be quickly found. 

'Now I realise what a huge mistake I made and I just want them back,' she added.

But police say the children will remain with their father under supervision of social workers until they have completed an investigation into their abandonment.

 The babies' father said he thought his 'beautiful girls' were safe with their mother at home in Romania

A local resident indicates the corridor of the council apartment block where the little girls were found 

'She may be charged with child cruelty and lose her parental rights,' said a spokesman.

Local Town Hall Child Care Director Cristina Pavaluta said: 'The mother says she wants the girls back.

'At the moment this is not possible. Not until the police investigation ends and we find out what actually happened, and are confident it won't happen again.'

Antonia and Iasmina are currently being looked after by their father under the supervision of social workers
