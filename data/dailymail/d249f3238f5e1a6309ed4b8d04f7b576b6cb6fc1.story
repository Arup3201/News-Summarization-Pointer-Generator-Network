Stroh's was an American beer powerhouse but then the family squandered what would have been a $9 billion fortune in just a few short years.

Bernhard Stroh started the brewing business when he arrived in Detroit from Germany in 1850 with $150 and a treasured family recipe for beer.

He began selling the beer door to door out of a wheelbarrow and soon Stroh's Beer was being shipped first around the Great Lakes where they had a loyal following and then around the country.

In 1980, Stroh's became the third largest brewing business in the United States when Bernhard's great great grandson Peter Stroh became CEO and purchased F&M Schaefer and Joseph Schlitz Brewing.

The family's new fortune saw them make the Forbes list of the richest families in the country, worth $700 million in 1988.

And Forbes today believes that the family would currently be worth about $9 billion.

But the something went wrong.

Family members confessed to Forbes that acquiring Schlitz, a beer company with six plants to Stroh's one, overwhelmed the business and they didn't have the marketing prowess to keep so many different brands up with rivals Anheuser Busch and Miller.

According to Forbes, Peter Stroh continued his disastrous acquisition spree among other moves but still the company failed.

By the end of the 1980s, Colorado's Coors overtook Stroh's as the country's third largest brewer and in August 1989 Stroh's laid off 300 employees.

Too big: Peter Stroh made a number of disastrous acquisitions in the 1980s

The following month, Peter Stroh agreed to sell the family business to Coors for $425 but Coors pulled out of the deal.

Desperate, the company brought in a renowned ad man to reinvigorate the brand. he changed the label, hiked prices and stopped the previous 15 bottles for 12 deal, all of which were disastrous decisions that resulted in 'the biggest drop in sales in the history of beer,' former director of market research Ed Benfield told Forbes. Sales plunged 40 per cent in a year.

In 1996, Peter Stroh decided to purchase another brewery with $300 million in borrowed funds, but that business, like Stroh's, was on the decline.

He then took a gamble on biotechnology and on Detroit real estate, exacerbating the problems.

By 1999, the company was worried it wouldn't even be able to make the interest payments on its debt, so it sold itself for scraps, brand by brand.

Miller Brewing bought some, while Pabst bought the rest at around $350 million.Â  Some $250 million went into debt service and employee pension fund liabilities while the remaining $100 million went into a fund for the family, but ran out in 2008.

After the company's dissolution in 2000, some Stroh brands were discontinued.

The Pabst Brewing Company acquired the most brands, and it currently produces Colt 45 malt liquor, Lone Star, Schaefer, Schlitz, Schmidt's, Old Milwaukee, Old Style, Stroh's, and St. Ides.

The Miller Brewing Company got Mickey's Malt Liquor and Henry Weinhard's. Most other Stroh brands disappeared after 2000.

In the 1980s the seven members of the fourth generation got $400,000 a year, according to Forbes.

'A lot of people were living off the family business,' 47-year-old descendant Greg Stroh told the website.

Though he wasn't one of them, and he co-founded three companies, including Izze Soda. Others ran into trouble with drugs and alcohol.
