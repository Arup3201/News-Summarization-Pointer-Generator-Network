A Liberal Democrat Lord Mayor has kept his job despite making a lewd remark to a schoolgirl.

Alan Armitage, 62, was accused of telling the child, ‘It’s sexy when you bend down like that’ while on official duty at an awards evening.

It happened while the youngster and other members of an under-13s sport team were having their photograph taken with him.

The married father-of-three, who is a city and county councillor, claims he may have said ‘best if you stand next to me’ and was misheard.

Oxford Lord Mayor Alan Armitage allegedly made the comment to a member of a under-13s sports team at a awards evening. He is pictured with Burmese democracy campaigner Aung San Suu Kyi last June

But a council investigation found it was ‘highly probable’ Mr Armitage, Lord Mayor of Oxford, did make an ‘inappropriate and disrespectful’ comment.

At a hearing held in secret to protect the girl’s identity, they ruled he had brought the office of Lord Mayor and the city council into disrepute.

But apart from being ‘censured’ – effectively, given a telling off – the council has taken no disciplinary action and he has been allowed to remain Lord Mayor.

Yesterday Mr Armitage said: ‘I regret the whole thing very much, but there is no single version of what was said that was endorsed by all the witnesses.

‘I am absolutely sure I did not say ‘‘bending’’ because in the context it is an inappropriate word to use.

‘I think it is very unlikely that I said the word ‘‘sexy’’, and that is what I have said all along, but in any case, I do not believe it [the word] has any sexual connotation.

‘I think it is very unlikely that I would have used the word ‘‘sexy’’ to a 13-year-old girl, but I cannot remember exactly how the repartee went. It was a confused, rowdy event, with a lot of people wanting a photo.

‘I may have said something like ‘‘best if you stand next to me’’ and that could have been misheard as containing the words ‘‘bending’’ and ‘‘sexy’’. However, I don’t believe the girls lied.’

Rap: Oxford City Council's Standards Committee called the alleged comment 'highly inappropriate'

The investigation began after a parent complained to the girl’s school about the incident in June last year, a month after Mr Armitage began his year in office as Lord Mayor.

The school passed it to Oxfordshire County Council’s child protection team, which found Mr Armitage was not a risk to youngsters.

But it did pass its findings to Oxford City Council to see if its code of conduct had been breached.

There were differing accounts of what Mr Armitage was alleged to have said.

They included: ‘It’s sexy when you bend down like that’; ‘bending is very sexy, isn’t it?’; and ‘ooh, that’s a bit sexy’. It is understood the girl and up to five witnesses gave evidence about the alleged offending comment.

Mr Armitage denied the allegation. His wife Jane, a professor of clinical trials and honorary consultant in public health medicine at the University of Oxford, has stood by him.

The council’s standards committee met on Wednesday and found he should be censured for breaking the council’s code of conduct.

But they also decided ‘there was no reason why Councillor Armitage should not continue to undertake the full range of his mayoral duties and noted that he had given an indication that he would do so’, council documents say.

While he has held on to the office of Lord Mayor, Mr Armitage now faces a grilling and disciplinary action from his party. A Liberal Democrat spokesman said: ‘Such behaviour is absolutely unacceptable.’

Mr Armitage, who lists his hobbies on a council website as music, history and his allotment, said the investigation had been ‘like a pall’ over his time as Lord Mayor, during which his duties have included presenting Burmese democracy campaigner Aung San Suu Kyi with the freedom of the city of Oxford.

A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said they were not involved in the case.
