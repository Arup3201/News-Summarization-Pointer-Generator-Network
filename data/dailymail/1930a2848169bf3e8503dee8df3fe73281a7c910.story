Following a fashion designer's worst nightmare, there was a one-hour hole in the normally tight Paris Fashion Week 
calendar.

Representatives of London-based label Hakaan said its entire collection had 
been lost.

Turkish designer Hakaan Yildirim was set to present his 
spring/summer 2013 collection to the media yesterday afternoon, on the penultimate day of the Paris schedule.

But it has come to light that the courier company that was transporting the collection has lost all the clothes.

A-list fan Jennifer Lopez wore Hakaan to attend a Fashion Week Fundraiser cocktail party held by Anna Wintour yesterday, and RIGHT, Emma Watson in Hakaan; Emma Watson wears Hakaan at the Elle Style Awards in 2011

PR company Karla Otto sent out emails yesterday to all those 
with invitations saying the preview was cancelled - after it became clear that the collection had disappeared.

'The whole collection is lost,' said Karen Nitsche of 
Karla Otto. 'It was when they were being transported. We don't know how.'

This is not the first time a courier company has been to blame for the loss or theft of a fashion collection.

High profile fans: Last season Kate Moss sat front row at the Hakaan show - and this year's turnout was set to be just as stellar

Last November, 
Marc Jacobs was forced to cancel his much-anticipated European press day
after his entire spring/summer 2012 collection was stolen from a train 
bound for London from Paris.

The
46-look range was due to go on show in the capital to give British 
fashion editors the chance to sample next year's trendsetters.

But in an e-mail circulated to the media the company said it could no longer go ahead because of the theft.

As
the pieces were effectively worthless because they were not yet in 
production, this led to fears that counterfeiters may be involved.

Thankfully
in this instance Hakaan is re-making the show pieces for an exclusive 
screening later in the week to be attended by selected members of the 
press and fashion elite.
