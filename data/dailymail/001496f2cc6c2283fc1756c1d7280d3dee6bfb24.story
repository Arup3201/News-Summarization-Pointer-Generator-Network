Didier Drogba's previous game in a Chelsea shirt proved rather more dramatic as his final kick in a Blues jersey resulted in them winning the 2012 Champions League.

But there was to be no penalty kick heroics from the Ivorian on his return to the club, as the veteran striker drew a blank in his first game back for the Stamford Bridge outfit.

Chelsea left the 36-year-old on the bench for the start of their pre-season friendly at Werder Bremen's Weserstadion, with the Blues fielding an attacking trio of Diego Costa being supported by Fernando Torres and Mohamed Salah.

A highly ineffective first half from the trio led to Jose Mourinho making changes at the break, and following a poor first half showing, expectations rose as Drogba replaced Costa for the second period.

By that point the Blues were already 2-0 down but Drogba certainly seemed up for it as he took to the pitch wearing his old No 15 shirt, pointing to the sky with both hands before the second half resumed.

He was straight into the action too as he just missed out in latching on to a Fabregas pass - signs perhaps that the legs may be starting to show their age.

But despite an early flurry, Chelsea failed to turn a decent spell on the ball into any serious sort of pressure and Drogba quickly faded out of the game in the central attacking role.

Like Costa before him, Drogba simply couldn't make it work with a support cast of Torres and Salah and the duo were replaced 12 minutes into the second half.

What did I do? Drogba's afternoon was one of frustration as the Blues played poorly in the pre-season loss

Shortly after, Chelsea had their best chance. But in a counter attacking move which started from a Bremen corner, Drogba was nowhere to be seen. A quick breakaway saw substitutes Nathan Ake and Eden Hazard combine before squaring a pass for Cesc Fabregas to chip over the crossbar.

Drogba was constantly marshalled by Bremen's Assani Lukimya and it wasn't until the 70th minute until he got back into the action - albeit with a clever run into the box ending with his cut-back easily cleared.

With 15 minutes to play, the former Marseille hitman had his brightest moment of the half as he collected a Fabregas pass.

It looked like vintage Drogba was back, but at an angle to goal, he rifled off target at the near post with options open to him inside the box for a pass. Not that you can blame him for having the temptation to shoot in a pre-season exercise.

Drogba ended the game as captain after John Terry departed late on, but rather than help lead a fightback, Chelsea conceded again a minute before time with the hosts scoring their second penalty of the afternoon.

Fans will hope a couple more weeks of pre-season training will get him back up to speed with the Premier League.

Fans will never forget how Drogba ended his first Chelsea spell in Munich but just as many will soon forget his rather anonymous showing in Bremen on his return two years later.
