Furious: Kimberly Ong storms out of her car as approaches Arakaki's vehicle

Wanted evidence: Ryan Arakaki says he knows that filming while driving is illegal but he wanted evidence of the assault so that he could file a police report

Arakaki claims that Ong tailed his car for five minutes and shouted profanities.

'Why don’t you get out of your car you f***ing fat ass. Bite me,' Ong can be heard yelling from her window while at a stop sign as she holds up her middle finger.

Later, she got out of her car in the middle of the road as her child still sat inside and stormed up to Arakaki's window.

You can hear me on the video saying, 'That's assault. That's assault.' But she really didn't care," said Arakaki to reporters.

'She was pretty much off on the deep end already. She was pretty upset.'

Ong also had her side of the story to share and she tells reporters she's not sorry for reacting so strongly.

Coming for him: Kimberly Ong marched over to Arakaki's car in a fit of rage after he cut her off 

In his face: Kimberly Ong puts her face to the camera and curses at Arakaki for 'almost causing an accident' 

Gives him the finger: Kimberly Ong was so angry with Arakaki for filming her that she gave him the finger 

'I was super, super angry. I really was angry,' said Kimberly Ong.

'And, of course, he was taunting me somewhat. So, that obviously made me even angrier. I'm not the most happy about it. But, I could have probably chosen some better words to use. I was upset and it's apparent. I don't totally 100 percent regret it.' 

Arakaki said that he can understand why Ong got so upset and attributed it to the fact that he cutting her off could have caused an accident.

He says that her having her son in the car might have made her even more anxious.

'What made her upset was she wasn't paying attention and I cut in front of her or changed lanes to get in front of her and she probably looked up, probably stepped on the gas and probably almost rear-ended me and she was upset that she had her son in the car and almost got into a car accident,' said Arakaki.

Not only did Arakaki almost start an accident but he broke the law by using a camera while driving.

Arakiki says he knows that what he was doing was illegal but he wanted to document the fight so that he could file a police report.

According to police, Ong's attack on Arakaki qualifies as, 'unauthorized entry into a motor vehicle.'

Traffic police will get a statement from both parties and will launch further investigation.
