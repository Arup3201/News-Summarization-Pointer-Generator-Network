With his arms around the shoulders of two vicious gangsters, it is not a portrait of the ideal family man. 

This picture unearthed by the Mail of Mark Duggan – whose death sparked the 2011 riots – suggests his links with the criminal underworld are deeper than first thought.

Following his death his supporters claimed he was an innocent father assassinated by police.

All three pictured were members of the notorious Man Dem gang which had links to Jamaica's ruthless Yardies

But to Duggan’s right in the picture is Junior Cameron, a career criminal serving a life sentence for shooting a man after a minor prang between their cars.

Cameron pulled a semi-automatic pistol on Gary Guthrie in Streatham, South London, and shot him in the back as he tried to escape. The 39-year-old died in hospital.

Cameron committed the murder in October 2007 – six months after being freed early from prison.

The man to Duggan’s left is Darrell Albert, who was in the same car as Cameron that night.

During the confrontation he shot Mr Guthrie’s friend Rowan Williams with a Baikal 9mm pistol – now the weapon of choice for gangsters.

Duggan was known by his gangster name Starrish Mark and was considered to be a 'major player' in the gang

The death of Mark Duggan sparked the 2011 riots which began in Tottenham in London

Mr Williams, 37, took a bullet in the neck but it was removed by surgeons and he survived.

Cameron, Albert and Duggan were all members of the notorious Tottenham Man Dem gang, which has links to Jamaica’s ruthless Yardies.

Duggan was known by his gangster name of Starrish Mark and was considered by police to be a ‘major player’ in the gang.

Others said Duggan ‘lived by the gun’. One source said: ‘I was told he was a major player and well known to the police in Tottenham. He was certainly not a sideshow.’ 

Duggan was shot after he had been placed under surveillance by police on August 4, 2011.

An officer said he opened fire because Duggan had a gun and appeared to be preparing to use it.

Criminal links: Duggan was shot after he had been placed under surveillance by police on August 4, 2011

The account was given at the trial of Kevin Hutchinson-Foster, 30, who was yesterday found guilty of supplying a gun to Duggan after a retrial at the Old Bailey.

The prosecution told the court Duggan and Hutchinson-Foster exchanged phone calls in the hour before the weapon was collected. 

The handover took place 15  minutes before he was shot. Despite Duggan’s criminal links, his family still insist he was assassinated by police.

They want to know why the gun he was supposed to be holding when he was shot was found some 16ft from his body in nearby bushes.

Duggan’s elder brother Shaun Hall said: ‘As much as this police officer is 100 per cent sure that his life was in danger, I will go on record and say I’m 100 per cent sure that his life was not in danger or any of his colleagues.’

An inquest into Duggan’s death, which was supposed to start this week, is expected to begin in September. Hutchinson-Foster will be sentenced on February 26.
