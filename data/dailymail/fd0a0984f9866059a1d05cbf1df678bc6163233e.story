Baroness Hale of Richmond, the most senior woman in the judiciary, said Strasbourg must rule on prisoner votes

European judges have the right to overrule Parliament when it comes to votes for prisoners, one of this country’s leading judges has declared.

Lady Hale, the deputy president of the Supreme Court and the most senior woman among the judiciary, said Strasbourg human rights judges must step in to protect prisoners because MPs will not do the job.

And in a ringing defence of the Human Rights Act, she condemned critics who want to deport foreign criminals or illegal immigrants who claim to have family ties in Britain.

Some people, she said, think we should ‘deprive British children of their right to live and grow up and be educated here if this will be the effect of deporting their only or primary carer.’

Lady Hale added: ‘Some critics are simply hostile to anything European.’

The defence of the Strasbourg court and human rights law opened up a rift between Lady Hale and other senior judges who have launched fierce attacks on the European Court of Human Rights over the past few days.

This week recently-retired Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge said that ‘Strasbourg is not superior to our Supreme Court’ and warned of a ‘democratic deficit’ which has grown because European human rights judges meddle in matters that should be for Parliament.

In an even more strongly-worded intervention earlier this month another Supreme Court judge, Lord Sumption, compared the behaviour of the Strasbourg court on prisoner voting to the activities of communist East Germany.

‘To give the force of law to values for which there is no popular mandate is democratic only in the sense that the old German Democratic Republic was democratic,’ he said.

Lady Hale’s speech - given as a lecture at the end of November but published only yesterday - set her at odds with her colleagues and confirmed that there is now serious division among the leaders of the judiciary over human rights law.

The prisoner voting row has been running since 2005, when Strasbourg judges ordered Britain to give the vote to convicted prisoners, who have historically been considered to have removed themselves from the electorate.

Despite overwhelming votes in favour of maintaining the law in the Commons, the European judges have continued to repeat their instructions.

Lady Hale said: ‘I have no personal view on which prisoners should be given the right to vote. But I do think that the issue is a good example of why we need human rights legislation.

‘Parliament is rightly proud that it represents and is accountable to the people.

Lady Hale said MPs cannot be trusted to protect the interests of prisoners

‘But members elected under the present franchise do not represent, and are not accountable to, the people who are currently disenfranchised.

‘The purpose of any human rights protection is to protect the rights of those whom the majority are unwilling to protect: democracy values everyone equally even if the majority do not.’

Lady Hale added that the media were hostile to the Human Rights Act, passed by Labour in 1998 to make Strasbourg rules part of British law, because ‘it was seen as a threat to press freedom from the outset.’

She added that ‘there was a perception that it has prevented us from sending some dangerous foreigners back to their home countries and generally allowed people with no right to be in this country to stay here once they have established a private or family life here.

‘Not every member of the public is persuaded that we should not export people if there is a real risk that they will be tortured in the country to which we send them,’ Lady Hale said.

She said ‘it may be no coincidence’ that Home Secretary Theresa May and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling ‘have been most vocal in their opposition’ to the Human Rights Act.

Scrapping the Human Rights Act, Lady Hale said, would ‘raise all sorts of interesting questions about the effect of the decisions which have been made during the period while the Act was in force.’

She said that that new rights had been established and ‘there is indeed a point to the Human Rights Act.’

Lady Hale, 68 and twice married, has been an Appeal judge since 1999 and, in 2009, the first woman on the Supreme Court. She has built a reputation as the most radical and feminist of the senior judiciary.

As head of the Law Commission that recommends reforms to the government, she shaped the Children’s Act, the 1980 law blamed by some for stripping parents of power over their children, and the Family Law Act, a no-fault divorce reform law pushed through by John Major that was later dropped when it proved unworkable.

In a Supreme Court judgement in 2011, she changed the definition of domestic violence so that it now includes shouting at a partner or denying them money as well as actual physical assault.
