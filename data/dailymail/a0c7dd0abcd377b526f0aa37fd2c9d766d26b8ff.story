A self-professed minister and one of America's Most Wanted for allegedly molesting two girls in a 'Maidens Group' has been arrested following a year-long search, according to Brazilian authorities.

Victor Arden Barnard, 53, was captured late Friday in an apartment near paradisiacal white-sand Pipa Beach in northeastern Brazil, along with a 33-year-old Brazilian woman, who he was reportedly living with.

Authorities were eventually able to determine that Barnard was living in Brazil and coordinated efforts with Brazilian police to arrest him, according to CBS Minnesota. 

He faces 59 counts of criminal misconduct after two women said they were among ten girls and women, who were chosen to live apart from their families and with him at his River Road Fellowship camp in rural Minnesota.

One woman alleged Barnard sexually abused her beginning at age 13 and continued until she was 22, while the other said her abuse occurred between the ages 12 and 20.

A majority of the criminal counts against him carry maximum sentences of 30 years in prison

The U.S. Marshals Service said Barnard initially left Minnesota in 2010, before the women came forward, and his whereabouts were unknown for some time. It was believed he and his followers had moved to Washington state.

Brazilian police inspector Paulo Henrique Oliveira said that Barnard entered the South American country legally in 2012, and a nation-wide warrant was issued in April 2014 for his arrest.

In 2012, after enduring years of abuse, brave former sect member Lindsay Tornambe (above) alerted authorities to the girls' plight. She was 13 years old when she was first taken to the camp. When she received the news of his arrest, she said she started crying

Another former cult-member, Jess Schweiss (above), who was taken to the camp at age 12, came forward to tell authorities her story too

Schweiss said when she told her parents about the abuse, her mother 'did not want to hear it', according to the criminal complaint notes (Shweiss's parents pictured above)

He had been living for at least six months at the apartment where he was arrested in Brazil, about 1,300 miles  from Rio de Janeiro.

During the arrest, police confiscated computers, cell phones, flash drives, religious papers and diaries from the condo, according to the Star Tribune.

Sexual abuse charges were brought against Barnard in 2014.

In 2000, he created a 'Shepherd's Camp' with a group of ten girls and women he selected to live with him at his home, according to Fox 9.

The Maidens, aged between 12 and 24, were first-born daughters handed over to Barnard and 'were forced to have sex with him' anywhere between once and five times a month over a decade (River Road Fellowship above)

Barnard allegedly kept the girls isolated and used religious coercion and intimidation to maintain his control over them, calling it cult-like behavior.

He  told one victim 'she would remain a virgin because he was a man of God,' according to a criminal complaint. 

An extradition order has already been signed by the U.S. Supreme Court and Barnard is expected to face charges in the U.S.

The Maidens Group, with girls aged between 12 and 24, were first-born daughters handed over to Barnard and were 'forced to have sex with him' anywhere between once and five times a month over a decade.

He said that Jesus and King Solomon had many women followers, so 'God's word' meant that it was normal for him to have sex with them.

In 2012, after enduring years of abuse following her parents leaving her at the camp when she was 13 years old, former sect member Lindsay Tornambe alerted authorities to the girls' plight.

When she received the news of his recent arrest, she said she started crying.

Tornambe said: 'It feels so surreal. I knew the day would come, but it finally came and it's almost numbing.'

Another former cult member, Jess Schweiss, told authorities her story too after she was taken to the camp at 12 years old. 

She said when she told her parents about the abuse, her mother 'did not want to hear it', according to the criminal complaint notes. 

Cindi Currie, who said she had visited Barnard's religious camp in Minnesota years ago and tried to persuade a friend to leave the group, spoke out saying that she cannot wait to see Barnard behind bars.

'He has ruined more lives. That man is the devil incarnate,' she said. 'I'm just ready to cry. I'm so glad they found him. Not only will Victor Barnard go to jail, but every adult who knew what was going on up there can start to pay, and maybe these girls can start to heal.'

Investigators believe Barnard abused other girls but have been unable to get others to come forward.

An extradition order has already been signed by the U.S. Supreme Court and Barnard is expected to stand trial in the U.S. for the charges he faces, according to Globo.
