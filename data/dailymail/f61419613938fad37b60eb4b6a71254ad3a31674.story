A man has confessed to the kidnapping, rape and murder of two women in a Cleveland neighborhood in the 1990s as well as additional rape and kidnapping charges.

Elias Acevedo, 49, was charged on Thursday with the kidnapping, rape and murder of 30-year-old Pamela Pemberton who was found strangled in 1994, and Christina Adkins, who was 18 and five months pregnant at the time of her disappearance in 1995.

He faces 293 counts, including charges involving the rape and kidnap of children.

Confession: Elias Acevedo has confessed to raping and killing two women in the mid-90s

Acevedo lived on the same block as notorious kidnapper and rapist Ariel Castro during the 1990s.

Following the discovery of Amanda Berry, Michelle Knight and Gina DeJesus, who had been missing for 10 years, languishing in the basement of Castro's home, there was a renewed focus on missing persons cold cases.

'Because the public became more aware and investigators were determined and relentless, people were re-interviewed and there was an increased interest in these missing person cases,' FBI spokeswoman Vicki Anderson said.

When police questioned Castro's neighbors, it was discovered that Acevedo was a convicted sex offender and hadn't reported his address to police.

Acevedo was arrested on June 11 in connection with a 1993 rape case after a rape kit taken at the time was tested for DNA evidence.

According to Cleveland.com, the woman Acevedo raped in 1993 was his brother's common-law wife.

She dropped the charges against him because he had seven children and twins on the way at the time.

When detectives spoke with her about Acevedo this year, they were able to start building up a profile of his behaviour, which involved strangling, keeping the underwear of his victims and a tendency to return to certain geographical areas.

The 1993 rape occurred close to the spot where his neighbor Pemberton's body was found in 1994.

Pamela Pemberton was found dead in a field on West 11th Street, near Clark Field, by three youths going to school October 24, 1994.

Homicide detectives said Pemberton had been strangled and was found naked.

She had been going to meet a friend at a bar and never returned home.

Acevedo was then linked to the 1995 disappearance of Adkins, who was last seen close to Acevedo's home.

A spokesman for the Cuyahoga County prosecutor's office said that Acevedo has confessed to the murders, which means authorities will not seek the death penalty.

The Guardian reports that Acevedo led detectives to the spot where he dumped Adkins' body in a manhole under a busy highway overpass on the Ohio city’s west side.

Remains recovered from the manhole were sent for DNA testing and test results today proved the remains were those of Adkins.

Acevedo has a long criminal history that dates back to 1988, including theft, receiving stolen property and a 2003 rape and kidnapping case for which he served three years in prison.

The 293-count indictment, unsealed Thursday, charged Acevedo with aggravated murder, as well as 173 counts of rape, 115 counts of kidnapping and one count of gross sexual imposition.
