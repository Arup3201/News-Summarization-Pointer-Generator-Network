Former prime minister Gordon Brown last night invoked the memory of his late baby daughter to ‘nail the SNP lie’ that Scotland's health service is at risk of privatisation.

Mr Brown was close to tears as he made the personal plea, accusing Alex Salmond of misleading people over the issue, which he described as a ‘Trojan horse’ in the independence referendum debate.

The SNP has repeatedly argued that the only way to save the health service from privatisation in Scotland is a Yes vote.

Emotional: Gordon Brown spoke from the heart as he launched a passionate defence of the NHS

Addressing activists in Glasgow, Mr Brown's voice wavered slightly as he spoke about his baby daughter Jennifer Jane, who died from a brain haemorrhage in 2002.

Mr Brown rarely speaks publicly about his family and is fiercely protective about any of his children appearing in public.

The speech yesterday marks Mr Brown's de-facto takeover of the 'No' campaign from his former Chancellor Alistair Darling.

Anti-independence campaigners hope the former Prime Minister's continuing respect in Scotland could help convince wavering voters to urge on the side of caution and reject independence.

Mr Brown's vitriolic clashes with David Cameron in the run up to the 2010 general election may also help to neutralise the SNP claim that a 'No' vote is a tick in the box for the Tories.

As well as invoking the memory of his late daughter, Mr Brown also spoke about how his sight was saved after a rugby accident left him blind in one eye at the age of 16.

The Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath MP said: ‘I love Scotland, I love the NHS. I was born into the NHS, I grew up in the NHS, my family grew up in the NHS.

‘When I lost the sight of my eye and faced the prospect of going blind, my sight was saved by the NHS.

‘When my daughter died it was as the result of not being able, not being able, to do anything to save her life and my respect for the NHS grew as a result of the experience that Sarah and I had.

‘Do you think that I or anybody else who cares about the NHS would stand by and do nothing if we thought the NHS was going to be privatised in Scotland and its funds were going to be cut? Would we stand back and do nothing without a fight? Of course not.

‘We created the NHS, we, not the SNP, built the NHS, we cherished the NHS, in Government we took the pain of a tax rise to double the budget of the NHS.

‘The only people who could put the Scottish Parliament and the health service in Scotland at risk is the SNP, not the Labour Party.’

Mr Brown outlined his plan on devolving more powers to the Scottish parliament at Scottish Labour's Glasgow HQ

Mr Brown, who will speak at 40 events in the days leading up to the referendum on September 18, said it is time to ‘nail the SNP lie’.

He said: ‘The NHS cannot be privatised if that's not the will of the Scottish people and the Scottish health service will have the funding that's necessary if that's also the will of the Scottish people.

‘Our proposals for a Scottish Parliament with more powers enhance the prospect for that funding over the next few years, without the disruption, the chaos and uncertainty and the loss that will occur if we break from the United Kingdom.’

The leaders of the three main pro-union parties have come together to pledge more powers for Scotland if it rejects independence.

Mr Brown, who set out a proposed timetable for greater autonomy for Holyrood yesterday, said these additional powers would bring ‘faster, fairer, safer and better’ change.

The Brown's ten-day-old daughter died in her parents arms  three days after suffering a brain haemorrhage. The funeral (pictured) took place at St Bryce Kirk in Kirkcaldy, Scotland on January 11, 2002

He said: ‘The choice on September 18th is really between two different kinds of change.

‘The change sought by the nationalists - breaking all constitutional connections with our friends, neighbours and family in the rest of the UK - places the dogma of independence over the needs and interests of the Scottish people.

‘But the proposals supported by the pro-devolution parties offer faster change, fairer change, safer change and better change. It is the change that most of us want and change that brings Scotland together.

‘We have now answered the question that the people of Scotland had for us about the certainty of change within the UK. Now it is time for Alex Salmond to answer the huge questions people have about independence.’
