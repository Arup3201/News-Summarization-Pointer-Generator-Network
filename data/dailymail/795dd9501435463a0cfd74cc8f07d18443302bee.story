Liverpool and Manchester United would have both received more than £70million extra in Premier League TV money had the cash been distributed based on audience.

Brendan Rodgers' side collected £97.5m in television money last season, the most in the Premier League, but they would have been in line for £172.3m if the distribution was based on the number of TV viewers - a difference of £74.8m.

Manchester United would have received £159.5m if the Premier League split their money more evenly based on UK audience. As it was, United picked up £89.1m, more than £70m less.

Show me the money: Liverpool collected the most in TV revenue, but would have received more

The Premier League TV money distribution is among the most balanced in the world with every club receiving a £52.2m basic payment with the rest of the £1.56billion pot being shared based on final league position and TV appearances.

But the system means the top clubs do not receive as much money as they could, as was the case last season when Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United were all at least £29m worse off.

Fulham were the team to profit the most from the Premier League's distribution system. The west London club received £63.3m last season but would have only collected £26m, a difference of over £37m, if the money was based on their UK viewers.

Difference:  United received over £70m less than they would have if the money was based on viewers

Cash: Manchester City won the Premier League, but still missed out on over £40m

So how did we work this out?

First of all, we collected the official viewing figures for the 154 live games on Sky Sports and BT Sport during the 2013-14 season. This data came from the Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board, BARB (www.barb.co.uk).

The average live TV audience was just over a million people and the most watched games all featured big sides playing each other, such as Liverpool v Chelsea (2.704 million) and Manchester United versus Arsenal (2.462m).

The least watched games were Crystal Palace v West Ham (251,000) and Norwich v Aston Villa (281,000). 

How the money was actually distributed...

How the money would have been distributed according to audience...

Entertaining: Liverpool were on TV 28 times last season and their games received almost 37 million viewers

The ‘big’ clubs like Liverpool and United attract much bigger audiences than the ‘smaller’ clubs and, hence, are televised live more often.

After adding up the total amount of viewers for each club, we divided the ‘equal share’ of the Premier League money proportionately according to those viewers.

Liverpool, for example, with almost 37 million people watching their games, were awarded £148.9m for their viewing share in addition to the £23.5m their received for finishing second, a total of more than £172m.

Cashing in: Fulham received over £37m more than they would have done according to their viewers

Raking it in: Real Madrid and Barcelona dominate the TV money in the Spanish league

Fulham, on the other hand, with just 5.8m viewers all season, were awarded £23.6m plus the £2.5m they were given for a 19th-placed finish, a total of just over £26m.

Some people would argue that Liverpool get more viewers because they are on TV many more times than ‘smaller’ clubs like Fulham. And they were on the box a lot more: 28 lives games for Liverpool against eight for Fulham.

But then Liverpool’s average audience per game was almost twice that of Fulham.

The way the Premier League’s money is distributed is one example of its relative fairness. The big clubs get much less than they arguably deserve based on popularity, but sharing the money more fairly adds to the competitiveness of the league.

In nations where clubs negotiate their own TV deals, the big clubs monopolise nearly all the cash, as is the case in Spain with Real Madrid and Barcelona.
