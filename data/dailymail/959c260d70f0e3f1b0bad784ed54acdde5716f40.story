Being at the Oscars, you'd be forgiven for being a bit starstruck.

But one entertainment reporter took it to the next level as he fell into an excrutiating frenzy when U2 frontman walk past him on the way into Vanity Fair's after party.

Speaking live on Radio 4's Today programme at 7am, Colin Paterson abandoned his measured commentary of the event to start screaming Bono's name.

Ecstatic: The Radio 5 Live regular could not help screaming Bono's name as he walked past on the red carpet. The Irish singer attended the Oscars with his wife Alison Hewson (right) and the rest of U2, who performed

Mr Paterson, who was speaking live at 7am, shouted 'Bono!' numerous times as host Jim Naughtie tried to talk over

In a scene that many have likened to Alan Partridge famously shouting 'Dan! Dan! Dan!' in a carpark, Mr Paterson rendered many listeners' morning coffees unnecessary.

Despite host Jim Naughtie's attempts to move past the hiccup, Mr Paterson ploughed on, until accepting Bono was not going to answer his cries.

He even tried to entice the rock star by telling him 'You're live on Radio 4! Come over here and speak to John Humphrys!' - prompting the voice of Jim: 'You're not speaking to John.'

Like Steve Coogan's comedy character, who
 pretends to accept Dan cannot hear him before trying again, Mr Paterson
 says 'I think this is undignified for Radio 4', before shouting out 
once more.

The band - The Edge, Bono, Larry Mullen Jr, and Adam Clayton - appeared together at the Hollywood event

They performed Original Love from Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom, which was nominated for an Oscar

Finally recovering from the incident much later, he encountered the Alan Partridge star, who had some words of advice.

He said: 'If you are in this profession that's a hazard you have to deal with.

'Live broadcasting means everyone is subject to Partridgeisms, and these traps everyone can fall into. So you have to watch your step.'

Reminiscent: The scene echoed Alan Partridge, played by Steve Coogan, famously shouting 'Dan! Dan! Dan!'

Oscar nominee Mr Coogan passed by the reporter and advised him to always watch out for Partridgisms

Checking himself, Radio 5 Live regular Mr Paterson joked: 'This was not the finest moment of my career.'

The scene followed U2's performance during the awards ceremony.

According to A Single Man star Nicholas Hoult, the performance was electrifying.

He tweeted: 'Did anyone see Bono serenade me?!?!'

The 24-year-old added: 'He wasn't looking directly at me, but I felt it. #oscars'
