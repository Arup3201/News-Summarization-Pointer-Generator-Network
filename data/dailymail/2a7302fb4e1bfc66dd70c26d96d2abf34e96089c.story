Paralysed: Glennroy Blair-Ford was on  a week of outdoor activities when he broke his neck welly wanging

A teacher left paralysed after breaking his neck in a welly-wanging  accident on a school trip has lost  his High Court claim for more than  £5million in damages.

Glennroy Blair-Ford, 45, was on an activities week with secondary school pupils on Dartmoor when he took part in a ‘mini-Olympics’ on the final evening.

One of the games involved children throwing wellington boots as far as they could,  with the task made more difficult for teachers, who had to throw backwards through their legs.

But Mr Blair-Ford, who is 6ft tall and  then weighed 15st, lost his balance as he swung the wellington and was propelled head-first to the ground with no way of breaking his fall.

The former head of design and technology at Wilmington Enterprise College in Dartford, Kent, was left catastrophically injured after fracturing his neck and will spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair.

He is on a ventilator for 23 hours a day and lives in a residential nursing facility several miles from his family’s home in Bromley, Kent.

Describing the moment when he fell, the teacher said: ‘When my head hit the ground I had a strange sensation, like my body  was shutting down, like a switch was  flicked. I couldn’t feel anything and I couldn’t move.’

Mr Blair-Ford, who is a devout Christian  and father of two, had sued the CRS Adventures centre in Devon, where he was injured in April 2007.

The court heard he had been ‘fit and well’ when he went on the trip with four fellow staff and 40 pupils aged 11 to 14.

His legal team argued he had been asked by centre staff to throw the wellington boot adopting an ‘unsafe’ method.

They contended his injuries were ‘a logical and foreseeable consequence’ of a man of Mr Blair-Ford’s size and weight throwing the welly using the method. CRS had failed in its duty of care by not carrying out an assessment of the risks and if it had done so ‘the method of throw would have been modified’, they said.

His solicitor Rebecca Dixon said: ‘Mr Blair-Ford faces a very difficult future.

‘He will never be able to work and is reliant on state funding for his significant medical and equipment needs.’

But Mr Justice Globe yesterday rejected the claim, ruling: ‘Extremely sad though it may be, this was a tragic and freak accident for which no blame can be established.’

‘On the evidence I have heard, the risk of injury was not such that steps should have been taken to guard against it.

‘In my judgment, the evidence of its likelihood was indeed “lacking such reality that it could be disregarded” and was at most “a mere possibility which would never influence the mind of a reasonable man”.’

Mr Blair-Ford and his insurers now face a large legal bill.

The judge ordered an interim payment of £100,000 to CRS pending a final assessment of the amount.
