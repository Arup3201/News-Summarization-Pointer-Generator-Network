Surprise: Andrew Jones stole a bag off a person in a bar in Soho, London, unaware that it was Sir Huge Orde, the President of the Association of Chief Police Officers (pictured)

A prolific thief preying on drinkers in the West End got a shock when he tried to snatch the bag of a top policeman, a court heard yesterday.

Andrew Jones, 49, targeted Sir Hugh Orde, former Chief Constable of Northern Ireland, and found himself being chased around Soho by ‘a posse of some of the most well-known and distinguished police officers’, Southwark Crown Court was told.

Sir Hugh, 55, now president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, was having after-work Christmas drinks in a bar last month with other senior officers and officials when he spotted the crook tampering with his bag.

The officer immediately introduced himself before arresting Jones, who has 79 previous convictions for theft. However Jones, a drug user, broke free from Sir Hugh’s grasp and made off, the court was told.

Keen marathon runner Sir Hugh chased after him as did his colleague, Assistant Chief Constable Stuart Williams, who re-arrested Jones some 100 yards down the road.

Sir Hugh is said to have ‘sat’ on the thief as he and Mr Williams waited for police reinforcements.

Peter Zinner, prosecuting, said Jones was seen to take hold of Sir Hugh’s black, holdall-type bag and move it towards him, with a view to stealing either the bag or some of the contents. He added:

‘Unfortunately for Mr Jones, it took place in the midst of 15 or so of Britain’s most senior police officers and staff, who were in the public house following a meeting.’

The court heard that Sir Hugh told Jones: ‘My name is Hugh Orde. I am a police officer. Why did you move my bag?’. He then arrested Jones and cautioned him for attempted theft. ‘It’s the first arrest he’s made for years!’, Judge Alistair McCreath joked.

Mr Zinner added that after Jones broke free ‘what follows is a chase – one of London’s most prolific thieves was being chased down the street by a posse of some of the most well-known and distinguished police officers’.

Jones, of Tottenham, North London, admitted attempted theft. He was sentenced to eight months imprisonment and will have to pay a  victim surcharge.

Last night Sir Hugh told the Daily Mail: ‘What I did is what frontline officers do every day. After the incident, I rang the Commissioner (Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe) and joked that I was helping to keep the streets safe! He thanked me.’
