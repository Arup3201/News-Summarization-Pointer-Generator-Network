Pressure is growing on George Osborne, Chancellor of the Exchequer, to deliver a tax break for married couples

At least three Cabinet ministers are backing demands for David Cameron to deliver a tax break for married couples within months.

Allies of Iain Duncan Smith, Owen Paterson and Chris Grayling indicated yesterday that they want the long-promised measure – worth £150 a year – to be introduced in the Budget in spring 2013.

They spoke out as 15 MPs, including several ex-ministers, yesterday called in an open letter to Mr Cameron for the change to be introduced to Parliament as part of next year's finance bill.

The intervention piles pressure on Chancellor George Osborne to placate social conservatives who are already enraged that he and Mr Cameron have made public statements in support of gay marriage, rather than recognising traditional marriage in the tax system.

Mr Cameron has promised to introduce a transferable tax allowance for married couples in this Parliament and Treasury officials said yesterday that is still the Government's intention.

But Tory right-wingers are concerned that the measure, which is opposed by the Liberal Democrats, will be left until the final budget before the 2015 election.

Work and Pensions Secretary Mr Duncan Smith has privately indicated that this is unacceptable to him because it would mean taxpayers would not see the benefit before the election – due around May – allowing an incoming Labour government to easily reverse it.

He also believes the measure would be dismissed as 'tokenism' if it was left until the dying days of the Coalition to be implemented.

A friend of Mr Paterson, the Environment Secretary, said: 'He agrees with Iain on this.'

And a source close to Mr Grayling, the Justice Secretary, said: 'Chris believes it's an important commitment for us to deliver.'

The MPs backing the letter include former children's minister Tim Loughton, former defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth and Nick de Bois, secretary of the 1922 Committee of back-bench MPs.

The letter comes at a time of deep divisions in the Tory Party over social policy. Mr Osborne provoked a backlash earlier this week when he claimed the Conservatives have to back gay marriage if they want to win the election.

He urged the party to emulate Barack Obama's socially liberal policies to win over young voters and women, who were credited with ensuring he retained the White House.

And yesterday the boss of one of Britain's biggest polling companies accused Downing Street of misrepresenting its results of a survey on gay marriage.

Mr Cameron said in a letter to former Welsh secretary Cheryl Gillan, who opposes gay marriage, that a ComRes poll found 10 per cent of current Conservative voters said the policy would make them less likely to vote Conservative compared with 7 per cent saying it would make them more likely.

But ComRes boss Andrew Hawkins said yesterday Mr Cameron had got his figures wrong.

He added that the policy 'loses the Party more votes than it gains', with 'former Conservative voters less likely to return to the fold'.

Other ComRes polls showed it had a 'general detrimental impact on the Party's fortunes', he added.

Proposals for gay marriage and the marriage tax break are expected to be introduced some time after the next Queen's Speech and before the general election.

A senior Treasure source said: 'We are committed to recognise marriage in the tax system.'
