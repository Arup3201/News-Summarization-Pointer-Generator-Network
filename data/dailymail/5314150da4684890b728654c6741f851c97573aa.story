Financial advisers are routinely misleading their customers about charges more than a year after a crackdown was enforced to weed out rogue firms.

Describing the failures as ‘unacceptable’, the City watchdog said more than seven in ten (73pc)  firms failed to properly explain upfront the cost of advice or how the charges work.

More than three in ten (31pc) failed to explain they are not independent and can only sell certain types of investments from a limited number of product providers.

The Financial Conduct Authority, the City watchdog, described the findings as a 'wake up call' for advisers

And more than a third (34pc) did not provide clients with a clear explanation of the service they offer in return for charging ongoing fees or their right to cancel at any time.

The failings come more than a year after the City watchdog banned commission payments to advisers to prevent future mis-selling scandals.

Last night campaigners said savers ‘do not know where to turn’ for decent financial advice, while the Financial Conduct Authority described the findings as a ‘wake up call’ for advisers.

The regulator also said it is likely to refer two unnamed firms which it described as guilty of ‘egregious failings’ to its Enforcement and Financial Crime Division. 

One is a financial adviser and another is a wealth manager.

The FCA added that the failings were worse at private banks and wealth managers which tend to specialise in wealthier investors.

The damning verdict comes as demand for financial advice is set to soar, as millions of savers seek to make sense of the government’s radical overhaul of pensions announced in the Budget last month.

Consumer campaigner and founder of Fairer Finance James Daley said: ‘This is incredibly disappointing as trust in financial services is already at an all-time low. Customers, which already can’t trust the banks, have nowhere to turn. There was a hope that the reforms to the adviser market would start turning things around. It would seem it hasn’t worked.’

In total 113 financial advisers across the country were reviewed by the watchdog as part of its investigation.

Clive Adamson, director of supervision at the FCA described the results as a ‘wake up call’ to the industry and said he was ‘disappointed’ with the results.

Tougher rules, including a ban on commission,  were introduced for financial advisers in January last year to protect savers and investors from rogue salesmen.

The crackdown applied to independent financial advisers as well as investment salesmen working in  High Street banks.

It followed a spate of mis-selling scandals spanning decades, including personal pensions, payment protection insurance, mortgage endowments and investment bonds.

In many cases, these products were hugely lucrative to financial advisers as they received handsome commission payments from insurance companies and fund managers to sell them.

Huge costs for the advice was often hidden from savers and docked from their pensions and investments.

Under the tougher rules, dubbed the Retail Distribution Review, advisers have to charge fees which must be spelled out clearly at the outset.

Firms typically take a 1pc cut of a customers’ investment, but many charge an hourly rate of £150 or more for providing advice.

The fees can range between hundreds to thousands of pounds, depending on the size of the investment and the type of financial adviser.

Those  who want to continue calling themselves independent also have to scour the market for the best products, rather than only sell products from the insurance company which pays them the most commission.

They also need to need tougher qualifications.

The major High Street banks have pulled out of providing financial advice for all but the wealthiest customers since the crackdown was introduced.
