A Chinese car that collided head-on with a chicken came out worst in the encounter.

The bird miraculously survived the encounter while the Japanese-made car was left with a large hole in the bumper.

The accident happened near an industrial park in Xinfeng county in south China’s Jiangxi province.

Huang Lingyong, 31, was at the wheel of his Toyota Corolla doing around 70 mph when the bird suddenly crossed the road in front of him.

Bird-brained: The driver was doing around 70mph near an industrial park in Xinfeng county, south China, when the bird walked out in front of him

'I braked because I am an animal lover and didn’t want to harm the chicken,' said Huang. 'But it was too late.

'I heard a sickening thud and I thought the chicken had gone to meet his ancestors.

'I stopped the car, got out and walked around to the front. There was a hole in the bodywork and the chicken wedged inside. I thought it must be dead but then I heard a cluck-clucking and bent down to look closer. It was a little shaken up and its feathers all ruffled, but otherwise OK.

Stuck: The man behind the wheel said he heard a 'sickening thud' before stepping out to see the brid wedged in the front of the car

'It seemed to me to be a very good advert for the durability of chickens and a very bad one for the quality of the car that I was driving.

'I took some video with my phone and uploaded the pictures on to the web and I was not surprised when there was a lot of feedback from people who shared my opinion of the car.'

Many Chinese people who saw his video took the opportunity to put the boot into the Japanese model.

However, the car dealer who sold the car said that the bumper was a cheap Chinese copy, and not an original part.
