A mother-of-four who ballooned to 22st has dropped six dress sizes and almost ten stone to set a healthy example as a nurse.

Louise Daniel, 36, from Hornchurch, Essex, was delighted when she landed a university place to study nursing after raising her family.

But then she realised she would have been unable to lecture patients about weight when she was embarrassed about her own unhealthy size.

Louise weighed 22 stone and wore size 28 before her weight loss, she now wears size 16 and weights 13st 6lb

Louise had struggled to squeeze into a size 28 after years finishing off her children's food because she hated waste.

She made her big decision to slim in April last year when she was accepted by the nursing course - and since has shed 7st and dropped to a healthy size 16.

She now weighs 13st 6lb and will start her degree course at Essex University in September.

The mother to James, 18, Liam, 12, Grace, nine, and Thomas, seven, now hopes to get down to 10 stone.

Proud Louise said: 'I had my kids and I went from a size 14 to a size 24. It was a combination of my pregnancies and a bad diet.

'I put on a lot of weight and I was probably eating for two for a long time after I gave birth.

'I tried to lose it after I had all the kids but I just wasn't in the right frame of mind.

She made habit of eating unhealthily, snacking and polishing off her children's leftovers

'I had gone from working on my feet everyday to being at home as a mum and that was my whole life.

'I used to eat the kids' leftovers because I never wanted it to go to waste - that's what mums do.

'I got accepted onto the nursing course then I looked at myself and I thought "I'm going to be doing 12 hour shifts". I didn't think I would be able to manage it.

'How could I turn around at nearly 21 stone and tell patients they have to live a normal life.

'I think it would have been embarrassing for me to stand there and lecture them.'

Louise said she was spurred to sign up to the nursing course after the sudden death of her father Brian Low, 67.

She did a foundation course at her local college before being accepted onto a three-year nursing degree that she will start in September.

Louise is pictured (L-R) losing almost ten stone, going from 22 to 13 stone 6 lbs

She slimmed down with the help of her local Weight Watchers class, ditching crisps, biscuits and large meal portions for low-calorie food such as chicken breast and veg.

Louise has even taken up jogging and goes once a week for 40 minutes - when a year ago walking down the stairs left her short of breath.

She wants to be a trauma nurse, which she knew she couldn't handle at her previous weight.

Louise said: 'I have always wanted to be a nurse, ever since I was a child.

'I got into hairdressing when I was young and I was doing that until I got pregnant.

'Now I feel so much more confident, I'm so much happier. Physically I feel one hundred times better.'

She is now proud and delighted to land a university place to study nursing after raising her family
