Godfrey Bloom has said speed is nothing to do with road accidents and motorists are the most oppressed group of people in Britain

Speed has ‘nothing’ to do with road accidents and motorists are Britain’s ‘most oppressed group of people’, Godfrey Bloom said last night.

The controversial MEP, who resigned the UK Independence Party whip in Brussels earlier this year, will be unveiled today as the new face of campaign group the Driver’s Union.

Mr Bloom has told the Mail he is has had enough of the EU and Ukip and he’s now planning to run for Parliament in a bid to speak up from the UK’s 35 million motorists.

In an outspoken return to British public life, Mr Bloom criticised charities which use the families of road accident victims in their advertising.

And he branded the police and other motoring groups guilty of ‘extortion’ for telling drivers they can avoid penalty points by going on a speed awareness course.

The Drivers Union was founded by Keith Peat, who spent 32 years in the London police where he was an advanced police driver and motorcyclist and is now an expert in crash statistics.

Mr Bloom said he would publicise evidence that speed cameras have been positioned as revenue raising measures and then seek to milk motorists for more cash afterwards.

He said: ‘The police can set a trap for you and then they can intimidate you into taking one of their profit-making driving courses. I don’t know of anything else in the British constitution where the police can suspend prosecutions in exchange for money.

‘Speed is not the offence. In law the offence is driving without due care and attention or reckless driving. ‘Speeding on its own is meaningless. It has nothing to do with accidents.

‘Most road accidents take place at 15mph or disproportionately involve young men. It’s a complete misuse of resources to carry on as we are.’

Taking on road safety charities like Brake, Mr Bloom said: ‘I don’t like these charities who make their points using the grieving mothers of road accident victims.

'You get these emotional women talking about how their child has been killed. But those people are killed because the driver wasn’t driving with due care and attention.

‘Speed is not to blame - or every formula one driver in the world would be dead.’ Mr Bloom also has groups like the AA in his sights, which he accuses of promoting speed awareness courses rather than speaking up for motorists.

‘The most oppressed group of people in the United Kingdom are our 30 million motorists. Regularly coerced and exploited by profiteers at the expense of genuine road safety, whilst using charities with no expertise in road safety to pave the way for their activities.

‘I do not believe that the interests of road safety and of UK’s beleaguered drivers can be best served unless we focus on genuine non-profit road safety.

‘I intend to work for an evidence based, not for profit road safety campaign so long overdue. I have accepted the Driver’s Union offer to become an Executive Patron.’

Mr Bloom resigned the Ukip whip in Brussels earlier this year after controversy around comments he made describing female members of Ukip as ‘sluts’.

He had already strained the patience of Ukip leader Nigel Farage by attracting claims of racism when he denounced foreign aid being sent to ‘bongo bongo land’.

Mr Bloom is still an ordinary member of Ukip but now sits as an independent MEP. He also remains flat mate to Mr Farage in Brussels.

Mr Bloom says he has been inundated with supportive messages from voters in his Yorkshire seat and allies say he could easily win re-election to the European Parliament as an independent.

But he told the Mail he now wants to run for election to the Westminster Parliament. ‘It’s even money at the moment,’ he said. ‘I’ll have a go if a suitable seat presents itself.’
