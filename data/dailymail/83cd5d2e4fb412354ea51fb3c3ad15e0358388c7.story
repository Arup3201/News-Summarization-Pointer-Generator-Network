Momentum is a key ingredient of sporting success. Being ‘on a roll’ can be the difference between winning and losing.

And it’s the same in broadcasting. If a programme gets off to a flier there’s often little that can stop it. BBC’s The Great British Bake Off is a perfect example. It was an instant, if surprising, hit when it began on BBC2 and is now a BBC1 blockbuster.

In its 50th year, BBC’s Match of the Day, which also started on BBC2, has a definite spring in its step. A strong World Cup folded into a celebration of Match of the Day’s half-century. The nation’s great and good queued up to wish the programme well. That, and the return of live FA Cup ties this season, and you sense an upbeat mood in the BBC’s football ranks.

Its Saturday evening showcase is definitely feeding off the credence and confidence its anniversary has given it. And it also seems to be trying that little bit harder.

The look is sharp and clean and a use of virtual reality to fill the foreground studio shots with the day’s key players works well, as does the enhanced graphics support for its pundits. Executives have used Alan Hansen’s retirement to cast the net around a range of former players turned rookie broadcasters.

Phil Neville — fully recovered from his World Cup co-commentary nightmare — Danny Murphy, Robbie Savage, Ruud Gullit, Neil Lennon, and Martin Keown are now regular team-mates alongside Alan Shearer. Rio Ferdinand is on the programme too, but more often in a QPR shirt than in an open-necked number of his choice.

The post-match analysis is insightful and contemporary — heat maps, player positions and touch maps, all available for selection. And if any encouragement is needed for the new ‘boys’ to play at the top of their game, just watching the opening titles probably does the job — or scares the living daylights out of them. That montage of the programme’s history, accompanied by TV’s most recognisable theme, is the challenge set for those in front and behind the cameras.

The graphics for Match of the Day have come on a long way since the early years

Saturday was not blessed with outstanding fixtures but there was still plenty for presenter Gary Lineker, Shearer and Savage to go at. Lineker is the ringmaster, seemingly involved in everything on the show, and it works.

Shearer talked of the noted improvement of Hull City. ‘It takes time to establish yourself,’ he said. He could have been talking about himself but the fact he ‘led’ the analysis on the opening three matches suggests he’s made it.

Robbie Savage rarely spoke in the first half-hour, but when he did it was a salvo at the officials’ highly dubious awarding of a West Brom penalty at Anfield. ‘Absolutely shocking decision,’ was his opener. Savage tends to speak in headlines but, with more experience and guidance, may find less is more. No bad thing.

Sunday’s Match of the Day 2 offered four more games. The programme has its own identity and subtle differences, even down to Mark Chapman presenting right to left as opposed to Lineker’s left to right.

All available graphics support and visual techniques were at hand for Neville, Trevor Sinclair and Keown, resplendent in shirt and tie, to unpick the action and the weekend’s output was rounded off with Angel di Maria winning the September Goal of the Month — a much-loved feature that began in 1970. Remember Ernie Hunt’s famous ‘donkey-kick’ goal?

And that’s the trick of the in-form Match of the Day: blending the best of the old with the best of the new.
