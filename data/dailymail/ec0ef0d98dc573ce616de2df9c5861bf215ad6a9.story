Terrifying: If the reports of one walker are to be believed, the residents of Royal Tunbridge Wells could have a giant Bigfoot-like creature in their midst (file picture)

It is an historic and quaint 'middle England' town which doesn't really like creating a scene.

But if the reports of one terrified walker are to be believed, the residents of Royal Tunbridge Wells could have a giant Bigfoot-like creature in their midst.

A man walking in the woods beside the town's common claims to have spotted an 8ft tall beast with demonic red eyes and long arms.

According to The Sun, the ape-like creature, which looked like America's legendary Bigfoot, roared at the walker, who immediately ran off in fear.

Over the past six months there have been a number of sightings of a mysterious beast.

Locals in the Kent town have mixed opinions about the claims - with some believing it could be a joker wearing a fancy dress costume.

Sightings in the town go back decades.

The Kentish Apeman was first spotted on the town's common during World War Two 70 years ago.

A man called 'Graham S' told a story of how an elderly couple saw it in 1942.

Writing for the community website Tunbridge Wells People, he said: 'They were siting on a bench when they became aware of a shuffling noise behind them.

'Upon turning around they saw a tall, ape-like creature with eyes that were burning red moving slowly towards them. They both fled - terrified.'

Bigfoot was the name given to an ape-like creature which many people believed inhabited forests in the northwest region of the U.S.

Scientists however do not believe it is a real animal and say rumours of its existence have come from folklore and hoax.

Royal Tunbridge Wells is located in west Kent about 40 miles from London.

It has a population of about 56,500 and is popular with tourists.
