A Los Angeles-based artist claims Versace has ripped off one of her designs.

Kesshia 'KESH' Kumari, who has more than 80,000 Instagram followers, used the social networking site to express her views about the luxury fashion house.

She uploaded a picture of one of the T-shirts she created with American Apparel inspired by her artwork in 2013 next to Versace's offering, which she captioned: 'At least make it better than the $30 (£20) original @versace_official. This looks like a first draft.'

She also uploaded a snap of Versace's £440 Medusa cotton jersey T-shirt and wrote: 'This.hurts. $650.versace rip off. sold out in 3 sizes. what is this madness? from huge designer labels to small boutiques to giant pop stars to fame hungry former friends. what is this? 

'Why can't these companies. these brands. these people create their own work? what happened? why do these people think that everything that they lay their eyes on instantly belongs to them? (sic)'. 

MailOnline has contacted Kesshia Kumari for comment.

In an interview with The Cut, the London-born designer said: 'I have always had a deep admiration for Versace. It’s an iconic brand that has stood the test of time. I am deeply disappointed in this.

'This is not only artwork from a show that took me two years to develop and create. It is not only artwork from a collection that I created for American Apparel to provide something affordable and accessible to supporters of my work.

' But this is also my face! I can’t understand how something like this could happen.' 

Kesshia Kumari, who is of Malaysian and Trinidadian heritage, began designing her graphic creations 17 years ago and began selling them on MySpace. 

The Versace T-shirt's description on Selfridges website reads: 'Versace’s flair for contemporary prints can be seen with this statement t-shirt. Crafted from cotton-jersey and featuring Medusa’s head printed on the front, simply team with jeans for a luxe off-duty look.'

MailOnline has contacted Versace for comment. 

Speaking to MailOnline, Jim Dennis, an intellectual property partner at law firm Gordon Dadds, the English member firm at Globalaw, said: 'Kesh’s design is certainly distinctive and the Versace design is strikingly similar. Provided Kesh’s design is original, then under UK law it will attract copyright as a graphic work. 

'It is for the Court to decide whether Versace has copied Kesh’s design but the similarities between the designs are so substantial the Court may readily infer that copying has taken place. If so, Versace would infringe Kesh’s copyright unless they can prove with clear evidence that they created their design independently and without reference to Kesh’s. If they are found to infringe then they may be liable for damages to Kesh or have to hand over their profits from sales of the offending t-shirts.' 

Carissa Kendall-Palmer, associate solicitor, EIP in London, added: 'In short, Kesh should be filing a law suit right away. The Versace T-shirt is clearly very similar to the T-shirt she developed for the American Apparel range in 2013. On the face of it, Kesh has a good case, but will need to gather evidence to support it.

'The design could be protected by both design rights and copyright, and it certainly looks like a bit of a rip-off. Many fashion brands rely heavily on these unregistered rights and at times, it can be complicated and expensive to prove their case. She is not on her own here. Copying is very common in the industry.

'There is always the possibility that Versace has a good excuse but it will take some explaining. Copyright infringement is criminal, and if Kesh registered her design, copying that is also a criminal offence under the new 2014 laws. If Kesh has a registered design, she will find it easier to assert her legal rights now.'
