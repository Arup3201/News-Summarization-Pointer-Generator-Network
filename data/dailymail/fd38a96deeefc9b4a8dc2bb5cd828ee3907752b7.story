Girl Guides will no longer pledge their loyalty to God and country under radical changes revealed yesterday.

Youngsters joining the Guides and Brownies will instead promise ‘to be true to myself’ and ‘serve my community’.

The change ends more than a century of tradition and has caused an outcry from the Church of England and other religious groups.

New pledge: Youngsters joining the Guides and Brownies will promise 'to be true to myself' and 'serve my community'

Tradition: Although members have been required to make a pledge to God since its inception in 1910, the phrase 'and my country' has been included only since 1994

Progression: Girlguiding has been trying to set a new direction for the movement over the past two years

Andrea Minichiello Williams of 
Christian Concern, herself a former Brownie, said: ‘This is a sad day. 
It runs against the tradition and history of the Guide movement, which 
was rooted in Christian values. 

The change comes just a fortnight after a uniformed Guide leader took part in the service marking the 60th anniversary of the Queen's Coronation

‘Now the promise sounds like a 
self-help manual.’

But Chief Guide Gill Slocombe insisted the previous 
oath had been ‘confusing’ about belief and ‘discouraged some girls and 
volunteers from joining us’.

The promise has been changed 11 times in the organisation’s history.

Although members have been required 
to make a pledge to God since its inception in 1910, the phrase ‘and my 
country’ has been included only since 1994.

The latest change comes just a 
fortnight after a uniformed Guide leader took part in the service 
marking the 60th anniversary of the Queen’s Coronation.

The Reverend Jenny Pathmarajah, from 
Taverham in Norfolk, helped carry the Coronation oil to the altar of 
Westminster Abbey and handed the flagon to Archbishop Justin Welby.  

She said before the service: ‘Her 
Majesty wanted someone who was a Queen’s Guide because she was one 
herself. She also wanted someone of faith.’

Originally named after a frontier 
regiment in British India, Girlguiding, as the organisation is now 
known, has recently tried to steer a more modern course.

Last year it hired as chief executive Julia Bentley, former head of an abortion and contraception group.

Miss Bentley said when appointed that
 Guiding ‘is not about itchy brown uniforms and sewing and baking. It is
 a modern, contemporary, vibrant organisation.

'Guides are more likely to be 
investigating a muddy ravine, going overseas to help on an Aids 
programme, or going to one of our pop concerts.’
