Newly elected councillors are being given tips on how to keep themselves safe – from voters.

Members of Camden Council in north west London have been handed a four-page dossier outlining the precautions they should take when meeting the public. 

According to the four-page leaflet, representatives must 'sit nearest to the door' and lay out seating at '45 degree angles [to avoid] appearing confrontational'.

Councillors at Labour-controlled Camden council in north London have been issued with a safety leaflet on meeting with voters, including planning an escape route and having car keys in your hand

On another, more sinister note, it adds: 'Make sure there are no heavy items in the room that could be used as weapons' and 'get a space which has a swift means of escape'.

For the especially anxious, there is even this instruction: 'Have your (car) keys in your hand [and] park facing the way you want to drive off'.

It warns that 'abusive phone calls', 'malicious anonymous letters' and 'unwanted callers at private homes' are all risks councillors face. 

Camden Council has taken the drastic move 14 years after a constituent brandishing a Samurai sword stormed into his local MP's constituency office in Cheltenham, Glos, and launched a brutal attack.

Liberal councillor Andrew Pennington, 39, was killed as he went to the defence of MP Nigel Jones, who was seriously injured by the attacker.

Cllr Theo Blackwell, who has taken surgeries in Camden for 12 years, said: 'I became a councillor not long after the sword attack and it was quite a live issue at the time.

'I've not had a problem in any of the surgeries I've attended but we do need to make sure the new councillors know the proper safety precautions.'

The Labour councillor admitted: 'Something that does make some councillors a bit uncomfortable is having to make public their home addresses.

'I still don't know why we can't just put the address of our surgeries.'
