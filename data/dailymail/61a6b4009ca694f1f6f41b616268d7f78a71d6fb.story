Primary school children have been banned from playing a new break time game they called 'the raping game'.

The playground activity had been named after a violent video game which depicts violent sexual assaults on a mother and two daughters.

More than a dozen boys, some as young as nine, were caught playing the 'the raping game' at Stanford Junior School in Brighton, East Sussex.

The school confirmed it had been taking place and headteacher Gina Hutchins said she had spoken to children about the vile name. It has now been called 'the survival game' following the head's intervention.

Mrs Hutchins said: 'As soon as we found out that this inappropriate word was being used, we spoke to the children concerned and they now no longer use it.'

The game has been played mainly by boys in Year 5 at the school for the past two to three weeks.

It involves one person being 'on' who has to catch others until only one is left uncaught and that person is the winner.

About 13 boys, aged nine and ten, played the game in the school playground but have since changed the title.

One concerned parent said: 'I was horrified that my son had learnt that word.

'He is only nine. Thankfully he did not know what it meant but it was that horrible thought he might use it elsewhere.

'Most people assume children learn these words at home.'

The parent added she did not blame the school saying it is almost impossible to stop children bringing words into the playground.

They commended the headteacher for her swift actions in taking decisive action and stamping out the use of the word.

It is unsure what video game led to the naming of the game, but several on the market contain scenes of rape.

One game called Rapelay sees the main character try to rape a mother and two daughters.
