Costa Rica manager Jorge Luis Pinto has added his voice to the angry backlash over seven of his players being drug tested after their shock defeat of Italy.

A storm erupted on Saturday after it emerged that five members of the Costa Rican squad had not had their obligatory FIFA drug tests before the tournament.

So after celebrating the victory against Italy that condemned England to an early exit from the tournament, the five players were requested to provide samples in addition to the two players chosen at random by doping control.

FIFA insisted that the testing of seven players was within regulations and acceptable, adding that the five needed to be tested for their 'biological passports.'

But the Costa Rican federation are understood to have now sent a letter of complaint to FIFA and today Pinto said: ‘People ask us how we can run as much as we did? Well, it's because we’re Costa Ricans.’

His team meet England on Tuesday - a dead rubber with the central Americans through to the second round and England out – but Pinto is clearly angered by what is sees as intrusion.

‘I don't mind them doing it but it was the way that they did it,’ he said. ‘We can't worry about it.’

Adrian Gutierrez, President of the Costa Rican national team commission, was furious. ‘We would like an explanation from FIFA,’ he said.
