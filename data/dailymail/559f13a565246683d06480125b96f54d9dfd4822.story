A group of illegal migrants were caught trying to sneak across the Channel into Britain hidden among a shipment of Christmas trees.

The 16 Albanians were found concealed on a lorry carrying the pine trees at Dieppe in northern France.

French customs said the 14 adults and two children had been discovered moments before the lorry was due to board a ferry to Newhaven, East Sussex, on Friday.

All were sent to a refugee detention centre, while two drivers of the Polish-registered lorry were arrested.

There are currently an estimated 2,000 migrants camped out in the port town of Calais hoping to board ferries to Britain.

The authorities have warned that many are now taking increasingly dangerous risks to cross the Channel. 

Earlier this year, two migrants had to be rescued from the sea after they tried to climb aboard a moving ferry as it left Calais. 

The desperate refugees swam almost half a mile from the shore to reach the 600ft boat as it headed to Dover.

Other migrants have risked their lives by hiding inside refrigerated lorries, clinging to the axles of heavy goods vehicles and even stowing away among a cargo of coffins.

In October this year, these illegal migrants were pictured trying to board a truck in the northeastern French port of Calais
