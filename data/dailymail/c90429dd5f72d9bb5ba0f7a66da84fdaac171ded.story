Major Robb McDonald was awarded a Silver Star Monday for his bravery during the September 2012 attack on Camp Bastion, which apparently targeted Prince Harry.

The Marine Corps air base in Afghanistan had been raided by 15 heavily armed Taliban insurgents, jets were exploding and a lake of fuel was aflame when McDonald arrived on the scene, and found his commanding officer dead.

With some 50 Marines holed up in an aluminum-sided building that officials later called indefensible, the former force reconnaissance Marine who already has two Bronze Star medals for valor in combat, took the helm and led a counterattack, which ended in 14 of the enemy dead and one wounded.

Staff Sgt. Jesse Colburn, an ejection seat mechanic on duty that night, said he and the other 'air wing guys' who only had a month of such training were doing their best until McDonald arrived. He had run a mile over exposed territory, armed only with a pistol, to get to the scene.

'(McDonald) walks around with this aura, like, "Fear not. I'm here." When he showed up and took action. ...You could see, a lot of Marines took a sigh of relief,' Colburn said, according to UTSandiego.com.

The attack killed two men and ended the careers of two generals whose heads rolled because they failed to secure the base after troop withdrawals.

Prince Harry was serving at the base when the Taliban fighters dressed in U.S. Army uniforms to unleash the ground assault on September 14 and destroyed or damaged eight aircraft worth a total of $200 million.

According to an investigation by the U.S. Central Command, the insurgents had split into three teams of five men and began a coordinated, practiced attack with rifles and grenades against the allied forces.

But despite the horror, a hero emerged that night.

On Monday, a Marine Corps official pinned the Silver Star, the nation's third-highest medal for combat, on McDonald's chest.

'I feel really proud and honored,' the 37-year-old married father-of-two said after the ceremony at Camp Pendleton.

He is the 45th Marine to be awarded the Silver Star for the war in Afghanistan.

McDonald was executive officer of a Marine Harrier jet squadron at the time of the attack. He was asleep in his room when he was awoken by machine gun fire and he and two others, armed only with pistols, sprinted toward the action, and could as easily have been shot by their own men as the enemy.

When he arrived, McDonald realized Lt. Col. Christopher Raible, commanding officer of Marine Attack Squadron 211, was dead. Sgt. Bradley Atwell was also killed and eight other U.S. troops, eight British forces and one civilian were wounded.

McDonald then led U.S. and British troops in a counter-attack and the fight lasted into the early morning of September 15. They killed 14 and wounded the remaining one, who was later interrogated.

Raible, nominated for a posthumous Silver Star for his actions that night, was awarded a Bronze Star with V for valor.

A year later, the Marine Corps commandant asked two generals, Major General Charles 'Mark' Gurganus and Major General Gregg Sturdevant, to retire an investigation determined they both underestimated the enemy, failed to build a unified security effort and didn't provide proper oversight.

In September this year, Britain's Ministry of Defence insisted Prince Harry was treated 'like any other serviceman' during the Taliban assault after a GQ magazine feature suggested he was 'stashed in a secure location’ when fighting started during the Camp Bastion.

An MoD spokesman said: 'Claims that Captain (Harry) Wales was rushed to a "safe room" during the insurgent attack on Camp Bastion are simply not true. We do not comment on individual security measures for very good reasons, but it would be clear from the extensive coverage of his tour that he was treated much the same as any service member deployed to Camp Bastion.'

Prince Harry had arrived for a three-month tour flying an Apache helicopter, prompting the Taliban to threaten to kill or kidnap him.

'We have informed our commanders in Helmand to do whatever they can to eliminate him,' Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid had told the press four days earlier.
