For more than a decade, the war between Call of Duty and Medal of Honor has raged - each battling to be crowned the ultimate first-person shooter in the genre. Both sides had casualties - for every Rising Sun there was a Call of Duty 3. 

Nevertheless, their battle lines were very different. While Call of Duty focused on the cinematic and dramatic, Medal of Honor strived for realism and simulation.

Take cover: There's a clever lean-and-shoot mechanic that you need to master

However, Danger Close has decided to buck the latter series' trend. Although the 2010 Tier 1 outing hinted at a Hollywood blockbuster influence, Warfighter is substantially more garish in its approach.

From the opening level, where you're dodging shipping containers falling from the sky to the action-packed car chases and high-quality cut scenes - it's clear this latest Medal of Honor puts entertainment before simulation.

And as a result, the line that once distinguished it from Call of Duty is more blurred than ever - a move that may enrage some fans, but will be welcomed by others.

Similar to the aforementioned, the relatively short six-hour campaign whisks you off to a variety of locations - from Pakistan to a monsoon ravaged Philippines.

The narrative, which largely follows the exploits of an operator called 'Preacher' is well paced, but not particularly coherent.

Although the varied environments are a welcome change to its predominately desert-based predecessor, proceedings can often be uncomfortably interrupted by the NPCs who populate them.

Varied: Bright one minute, dark the next, Warfighter offers plenty of environments

AI is by far one of Medal of Honor’s weakest hands, with enemies often taking cover in the open or charging straight into machine gun fire.

There’s no sense that you’re fighting against one coherent force, rather a bunch of individual bots with reckless disregard for their own lives.

The Tier 1 operators, too, are not quite as skilled as expected. They'll throw rogue grenades, shoot at inanimate objects and sometimes just stand idly by while you're taking fire.

Thankfully, where Medal of Honor excels is its gameplay. Shooting is wonderfully responsive, with each weapon providing its own unique feel and result. Weapon models are all well-detailed and sound authentic, too.

The breach mechanic is startlingly similar to the Call of Duty series, but Danger Close have tried to breathe new life into it. Before a breach, you are given a choice of how to do it.

This ranges from throwing in a flash bang grenade, to hammering the door down or shooting the lock.

Although each one is essentially just a pre-set animation, the slow-motion gunplay that follows is infinitely rewarding.

There are also some strong vehicle sections - which, although so often a weakness in games of this type - work remarkably well.

A car chase in the early stages is a particular highlight - the handling and clever level design helping to give you the illusion of freedom, even if it's in fact rather linear.

Work together: In the campaign, you'll often have AI team-mates working with you

Graphically the game performs admirably, too, and is backed up with strong audio effects.

The Frostbite 2 engine has been tweaked since its Battlefield 3 inception, resulting in wonderful lighting and animation. Texture quality does take a slight hit, as do some character models, but they are acceptable payoffs given the silky-smooth frame-rate.

Multiplayer in Warfighter is superb. There’s the standard deathmatch and other expected modes, but what makes it stand out is Fireteams. Here, you work as pair of Tier 1 special forces soldiers.

Cleverly, there are lots of mechanics in place to ensure working together is tactically sound and entertaining.

You can share weapons and ammo at any time, see your partner’s status and position through solid objects, and can spawn on your team-mate if he’s safe.

Also, if your friend is killed, taking revenge and shooting his slayer will see him instantly respawned.

Medal of Honor has always divided opinion, and Warfighter will be no different.

Different focus: The game sacrifices realism and concentrates on action

Indeed, critics may argue its somewhat shallow nature takes away from what it means to be a Tier 1 operative.

But what it lacks in realism, it makes up with its colossal production values and memorable multiplayer - a tried-and-tested recipe for success.

It's not the deep, emotional journey many were expecting, but action blockbusters never are.
