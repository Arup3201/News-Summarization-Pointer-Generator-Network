They are the hands that feed; slicing, dicing, cutting, and crafting the food which sustains us.

But the battle-worn fingers and scarred knuckles of the world's top chefs  are rarely on show.

Now one artist and photographer has captured the hands of 50 culinary stars in a series of stark black and white portraits and put them on display.

Fifty Chefs: The Hands That Feed London is an exhibition of images from photographer and artist Katie Wilson.

The exhibition is the culmination of a ten-year photographic project to tell the stories of the people who work in the capital's favourite kitchens.

From kebab shops and greasy spoons to the city's most rarefied restaurants, and all the everyday eateries in-between, Ms Wilson has captured the intriguing faces and knife and pan-wielding palms of 50 diverse and dedicated chefs.

Ms Wilson said: 'I was fascinated by the scars worn with pride on the hands of the chefs I met.'

'I began to wonder; who are the people who cook for London?' she continued.

'Not only the famous faces, but the sous chefs and kitchen hands; the dishwashers and potato peelers.'

So began the project, dubbed The Hands That Feed London.

Shot in a raw documentary style, each subject was photographed on location, before briefings, or as they woke from sleep snatched between services.

This is a look at the hard graft that goes on in the restaurant engine room; the blood, sweat and tears that go into making the serene and sometimes glamorous dining experience we've come to expect.

'Over the last ten years our interest in food has evolved enormously and as a result everyone has had to up their game - not just at the top end but local cafes too,' she continued.

'It is us Londoners - in all our diversity - who have made this City the serious food capital it has become.'

The exhibition is a collaborative work; writer Nellie Blundell has collected stories of the city and its kitchens to sit beside each image, and artist Caroline Hobkinson has created a banquet table revealing the often unlikely foods the featured chefs actually eat while working.

Proceeds from the sale of prints at the exhibition will be donated to London-based food charity, FareShare.

FareShare rescues good food that would otherwise go to waste and delivers it to other charities to help feed people in need and benefit the planet. Last year they redistributed enough food for 13.2 million meals, feeding 82,100 people every day.  

Fifty Chefs: The Hands That Feed London runs from Friday 3 to Thursday 16 April at Londonnewcastle Project Space, 28 Redchurch Street, Shoreditch, London.
