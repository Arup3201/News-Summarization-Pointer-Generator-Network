Hugo Chavez's hand-picked successor was narrowly elected president of Venezuela today.

Nicolas Maduro, a 50-year-old former bus driver, campaigned in a tight election on a promise to carry on Mr Chavez's self-styled socialist revolution and defeated two-time challenger Henrique Capriles by just 300,000 votes.

Today Mr Maduro called for peace and said he would be willing for the election result to be audited after officials said he took 50.8 per cent of votes, compared to 49.1 per cent for Mr Capriles.

‘We don't want violence, we want peace,’ Mr Maduro said. ‘They (the opposition) want an audit, we welcome the audit... I formally request the National Electoral Commission to carry out an audit.’

Mr Capriles had been campaigning on claims Mr Chavez's regime had put Venezuela on the road to ruin. Mr Maduro, acting president since his death, held a double-digit advantage just two weeks ago.

Chavistas set off fireworks and blasted car horns as they cruised downtown Caracas in jubilation.

Mr Maduro addressed a crowd from the presidential palace and called his victory further proof that Chavez ‘continues to be invincible, that he continues to win battles’.

He said that Mr Capriles had called him before the results were announced to suggest a ‘pact’ and that Mr Maduro refused. There was no immediate word from Mr Capriles.

Mr Maduro, a longtime foreign minister to Mr Chavez, rode a wave of sympathy for the charismatic leader to victory.

He pinned his hopes on the immense loyalty for his boss among millions of poor beneficiaries of government largesse and the powerful state apparatus that Mr Chavez skillfully consolidated.

Mr Capriles's main campaign weapon was to emphasise ‘the incompetence of the state’ in handling the world's largest oil reserves.

Turnout was 78 per cent, down from just over 80 per cent in the October election that Mr Chavez won by a nearly 11-point margin.
