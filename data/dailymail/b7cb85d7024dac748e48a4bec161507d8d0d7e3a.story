A 30-year-old woman has been accused of fatally stabbing and cutting the genitals off a man she claimed sexually assaulted her.

Cristal Paulette Richardson allegedly stabbed 34-year-old Cedric Lamont Owens more than 130 times and sliced his throat with a pocket knife in a Dallas motel room after a night of heavy drinking and drug taking.

She also allegedly hacked off his penis and scrotum in the April 28, 2012 attack. 

'You're going to see some of the worst pictures of your lifetime,' prosecutor Josh Healy told jurors at Richardson's murder trial, which began Tuesday.  'I don't envy your position.'

Charged with murder: Cristal Paulette Richardson, 30 (pictured) allegedly stabbed 34-year-old Cedric Lamont Owens to death and cut off his genitalia in April 2012

Dallas News reported Richardson pleaded not guilty to the gruesome crime, with defense attorney Paul Johnson saying his client defended herself.

On the night before Owens was 
slain, prosecutors say he and Richardson met at a convenience store. 
She had dollar bills pinned to her dress and told him it was her 
birthday.

It is not clear if the pair were dating or had met for the first time.

The court heard that the pair stopped several times that night so Owens could 
buy alcohol, marijuana, cocaine and PCP.

Prosecutors said the couple
 joined three other people for a party at Motel 6 on Interstate 30 
near Jim Miller Road in Far East Dallas. Owens paid for the room.

The pair were joined by Diedre
 Lyons, a friend of Owens', her cousin and another friend. She said everyone was drinking and taking drugs. Lyons said she left the party about 4am or 5am the next day because she felt sick.

The afternoon after the party, about 5pm, a 
security guard heard a loud disturbance from Owensâ€™ room on the third floor and saw Richardson run out of the room, naked and covered in blood.

He called police, who found Owens dead in the room. It appears that no-one else was in the room.

A Dallas County medical examiner's office field agent who examined Owens' body found that he had 'multiple stab wounds to his upper body, his throat was cut and there was traumatic amputation' of genitalia.

claims he raped her before she allegedly stabbed him

Meanwhile, Richardson was taken to hospital with a stab wound on her right thigh, a cut on her forearm and hair stuck in the dried blood on her fingers.

Dallas News reported that, during her sexual assault exam, Richardson said he felt like she had been raped, but couldn't recall what happened or identify her attacker.

She told the medical examiner, Dr. Evelina Alcalen, who testified in court, that she had consumed vodka, beer, marijuana and medication for schizoaffective disorder.

Alcalen said there were no signs of sexual assault injuries, but it's normal for rape victims to be injury- free.

Forensic analysts said the pocket knife police allegedly used to stab Owens was mainly covered in Richardson's blood, and a used condom found at the crime scene matched Richardson's and Owens' DNA.

At the time of the attack, Richardson
 told investigators she ate breakfast and took a nap and didn't remember anything else until she was taken away from
 the scene.

In court Tuesday, Healy showed jurors a video of an interview in which Richardson said she remembered stabbing Owens, but not killing or castrating him.

Both Richardson and Owens had criminal records, including felony convictions, according to CBS News.

Richardson's record included convictions for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, theft, marijuana possession and drunken driving.

Owens' record included convictions for drug possession, family violence assault and evading arrest.
