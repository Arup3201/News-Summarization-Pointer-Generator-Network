It would be many people's idea of hell, but DIY fans are being offered the chance to sleep in a branch of Ikea in Australia for the grand price of £6.20 (AU$11) per night.

The bizarre hotel experience is being offered as a competition, picking out three sets of winners to stay overnight at the Tempe store, on the outskirts of Sydney. 

Ikea Australia has teamed up with accommodation website Airbnb to offer three families the unique sleepover. 

Not just for buying a bed, now you can stay in one over night at the store in Tempe, Australia

The winning groups, of up to four people, will get the the chance to spend one night in the store where they'll stay in Ikea bedroom displays transformed into quirky accommodation.

Each room will be hosted by Claire Ferguson, a real-life Airbnb host.

Guests will get a grand tour of the store, complete with tips on 'how to make their home more Airbnb friendly', the opportunity to watch TV and play video games and they will also get to take their own bed sheets home the next morning.

The store is located close to the airport, has panoramic views of the city and the rooms will be conveniently close to the kitchen and diner - perfect for a midnight feast.

On Airbnb:  The three options to choose from include rustic charm, inner city living or modern elegance

There are three options to choose from; rustic charm, inner city living or modern elegance, all of which have been listed on the Airbnb Australia website.

The spacious rustic charm room is reminiscent of a Swedish summer cottage, with decorative embroidery, lightly antique-stained finishes and use of natural materials throughout.

Both kids and adults will have their own space in the inner city living room, a 55 square metre two-bedroom apartment with bold colours and graphic prints.

While the modern elegance room is coordinated perfectly for the family with kids who like to camp out, and parents who wish they could sleep in.

Participants must sign a waiver acknowledging that they will 'be awoken in the morning in a remarkable way' but the store goes on to reassure the guests it will be 'nothing frightening — we promise!'

'Airbnb gives people access to the most unique listings around the world from tree houses to yurts to villas, and now we're adding Ikea to the list,' Eva Ross, Local Operations Lead at Airbnb Australia, said.

The Ikea store is in Tempe, a suburb of Sydney, situated right next to the airport and with panaromic views of the city

'The experience is sure to thrill any guest.'

The competition entries close on August 26 at 5pm (AEST) and winners will stay in the Tempe IKEA store on 31 August.
