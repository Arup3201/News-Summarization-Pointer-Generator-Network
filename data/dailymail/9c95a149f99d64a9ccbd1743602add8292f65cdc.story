Speaker John Bercow has come under fire for his choice of Carol Mills for Clerk of the House

Commons Speaker John Bercow will tomorrow face MPs for the first time since a row erupted over his recommended candidate for the post of clerk of the House.

He will reportedly make a statement in the chamber amid growing disquiet among critics of the choice of Australian Carol Mills, who is currently head of the Department of Parliamentary Services (DPS) in Canberra.

Members have voiced concerns about her lack of knowledge of Westminster procedures and believe she is too inexperienced for the prestigious £200,000-a-year position, which combines the clerk's duties as a key constitutional adviser with the role of Commons chief executive.

She has been dubbed the 'Canberra caterer' because her responsibilities at the Australian senate are said to include managing kitchens and cleaning.

In an effort to defuse the row, Mr Bercow, who is expected to visit Australia next month, has indicated he wants to split the functions into two jobs, but the suggestion has failed to appease the critics led by Tory Jesse Norman.

The Hereford and South Herefordshire MP has submitted a motion calling for Parliament to be given the opportunity to scrutinise the appointment.

It has since been signed by 84 members from across the political spectrum, including three former foreign secretaries, a former deputy leader of the Labour party and six former ministers. All three deputy speakers are also understood to be against the choice of Ms Mills.

Writing in the Mail on Sunday, Mr Norman said: 'So far there has not been any indication that Parliament will be given a say on this matter. Nor has the appointment of Ms Mills been withdrawn.

'Instead it has been proposed that the role of clerk should be split and a new chief executive (presumably Ms Mills) be appointed as well.

'This effectively concedes that Ms Mills is not qualified to be clerk. But instead of dropping her and starting again, it puts the cart before the horse and proposes an on-the-hoof restructuring of the House, all it seems, in order to accommodate her appointment.

'Not only that - it proposes a new role of chief executive at a probable cost of £150,000- £200,000.'

Carol Mills is the current Department of Parliamentary Services secretary in Canberra, Australia, a service department that supports the work of the Federal Parliament and is the principal support agency for Parliament House.

It works closely with the Department of the Senate and Department of the House of Representatives to support the operations of the Parliament and its Committees, has around 800 staff and an annual budget of around $120 million. 

She is the former director general of Communities NSW and the Department of Arts, Sport and Recreation. 

He condemned the appointment process as 'flawed', because key people such as deputy speaker Labour MP Lindsay Hoyle had not been included. He also criticised the use of head hunters, adding: 'It is far from clear how they could have recommended a candidate who was, and remains, under investigation in Australia for maladministration.'

Mr Norman warned that if allowed to drag on the affair could damage the office of Speaker and, in turn, the Commons.

He added: 'We must hope he will move swiftly to end that appointment [in his statement tomorrow], reaffirm the importance of due process in the selection of public officials and put the wider issue of clerkship before a special committee elected by MPs.'

Former deputy speaker Nigel Evans added on the Sky News Murnaghan programme that the real issue was whether Mr Bercow would have the 'guts' to stand up and tell the House Ms Mills was no longer the appointee.

He went on: 'It has transpired that while she is very good at administration apparently she knows nothing about the constitution and wouldn't know what Erskine May is for instance, which is the bible of the chamber.

'In the meantime the Speaker has said why don't we split the job. Well, if we split the job which may have some sense may not, don't you re-open the appointment panel again to have a look?

'The real issue is whether John is going to have the guts tomorrow to stand up in Parliament and say Carol Mills is no longer the appointee of a position that really now doesn't exist. We need a panel to be set up to look at the job, what sort of job it is first and once we have sorted out what the job is then we can look at the candidates.'

Meanwhile, an influential committee of members will meet tomorrow to discuss the Speaker's expected statement.

Bernard Jenkin, chairman of the public administration select committee, said he would be arguing for a pre-appointment hearing with Ms Mills if she is to be appointed to either the post of clerk or chief executive due to the need for scrutiny.

Ms Mills was recommended for the role earlier this month following an open recruitment process with a selection panel led by the Speaker.

Mr Bercow is believed to be keen to bring in an outsider to press ahead with modernisation of the House, rather than promoting deputy clerk David Natzler.

Downing Street has insisted the new clerk must have the backing of MPs.The Prime Minister is responsible for passing the recommendation to the Queen to be finalised.

A spokeswoman for the Speaker told the Mail on Sunday: 'The Speaker is keen to listen to the views of MPs.'

She said his visit to Australia was planned a year ago and added that Commonwealth visits to meet other speakers were an 'important element' of his job. 

The Clerk of the House is the impartial main political adviser to the House, and adviser on all its procedure and business. They often appear before Select and Joint Committees to examine Parliamentary and constitutional matters.

They sit at the Table of the House, and wear court dress, with a barrister's wig and silk robes. The Clerks of the table are consulted by the Chair, Ministers, Whips, and MPs on any matter that may arise in the conduct of a sitting.

They also act as the Chief Executive of the House of Commons Service, which is made up of 2,000 people, and chairs the Management Board.

The current Clerk is Sir Robert Rogers, who has held the position since October 1, 2011, and was knighted the following year. On April 30, he announced he intended to retire at the end of August, after four decades in the House.
