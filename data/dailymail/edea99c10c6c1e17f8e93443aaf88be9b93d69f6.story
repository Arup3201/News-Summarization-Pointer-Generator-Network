Newcastle United will sign Jamaal Lascelles and Karl Darlow from Nottingham Forest - but the pair will spend one last season at the City Ground.

The north-east side reached an agreement with Forest boss Stuart Pearce to see off competition from Arsenal, Queens Park Rangers and West Ham for their signatures.

Their loan deals do not contain recall clauses, so Newcastle won't see anything of them for the next year, according to the Chronicle.

Rising star: Newcastle United have signed 20-year-old defender Jamaal Lascelles from Nottingham Forest, though he will be loaned back to the Championship club for the season ahead

Safe hands: Newcastle have also signed Forest's goalkeeper Karl Darlow, though he will too remain with Stuart Pearce's side for another 12 months

Defender Lascelles, 20, had signed a four-year contract with Forest back in August 2012 and became a regular in the team last season.

23-year-old goalkeeper Darlow is a product of Aston Villa's academy, moving to Forest back in 2006.

He emerged as the club's No 1 back in 2012 and has 67 first team appearances for the club.

Agreement: Forest manager Stuart Pearce believed that Newcastle would be the best destination for the pair

Possible deal: Newcastle United have been keen on France international Clement Grenier for a while

Meanwhile, manager Alan Pardew remains keen to bring in another striker, while a deal for Clement Grenier at Lyon remains a possibility.

The 23-year-old France international has long been in Newcastle's sights but he is keen to join a Champions League team.

If one of those does not come along soon the greater Newcastle's chances become.
