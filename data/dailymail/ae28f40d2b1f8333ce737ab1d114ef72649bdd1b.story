Dozens of sick children on a Georgia-based hospital's cardiac ward were today left 'overwhelmed' after receiving  a staggering 70,000 hand-crafted Valentine's Day cards from strangers.

The youngsters,  who suffer from potentially deadly congenital heart disease, were gifted the colorful and creative cards after a local radio station joined forces with Children's Healthcare of Atlanta.

In a city-wide appeal, 104.7 The Fish and the pediatric hospital asked local schools and organizations to create and send Valentine’s Day cards to the young patients in a bid to brighten up their day.

And the response was incredible - tens of thousands of strangers joined in the efforts to make the children smile and feel loved on February 14. They ended up producing 70,000 cards in total.

'What we received truly blew us away,' hospital spokesperson Caroline Gallentine said, explaining that most of the 'brave' and 'compassionate' youngsters are forced to manage 'lifelong cardiac conditions'.

'This exceeded our wildest expectations. But we are so excited by the number, because it means that 70,000 people were thinking about our incredible heart kids, and they deserve recognition.'

Speaking to The Huffington Post, Ms Gallentine said the hospital and 104.7 Fish had launched the appeal because the children often have to spend long periods of time in the cardiac ward.

'The kids who are in the hospital today had to miss their Valentine’s Day parties at school, so we thought it would be meaningful to bring the valentines to them,' she said.
