A group of Nepalese sherpas were caught in an avalanche on the slopes of Mount Everest today, killing 13 and injuring three.

The first images of one of the surviving sherpas, named as Dawa Tashi Sherpa, has been released as he and two others remain in critical condition at Grandi International Hospital, Kathmandu.

Four
 of the sherpas are still missing and feared dead after what is thought 
to be the deadliest incident to ever occur on the world's highest 
mountain.

Survivor: Nepalese Mountaineer and Mount Everest avalanche survivor sherpa Tashi Daba is undergoing treatment at the Intensive Care Unit of Grandee Hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal

The group had gone up the mountainside early in the morning to fix the ropes for hundreds of climbers when the avalanche hit them just below the camp around 6.30am.

A
 spokesman for the Nepal’s Ministry of Tourism and Aviation said the 
government will pay £400 compensation to the families of the dead.

‘Those rescued alive are undergoing medical treatment,’ the spokesman said.

The
 guides come from multiple trekking companies - with some working on 
behalf of NBC Everest Expedition 2014 and Everest Chinese Expedition 
2014.

According to the Ministry, search and rescue operations are continuing at the avalanche site, at a height of 5,900m.

Authorities called off the rescue operation for survivors after 12 Nepali climbing guides were killed in an avalanche on Mount Everest, as bad weather closed in

Hundreds 
of climbers, their guides and support guides had gathered at the base 
camp, gearing up for their final attempt to scale the 29,028-foot peak 
early next month when weather conditions get favorable.

A list of the dead sherpas were released by the Nepalese government today:

1. Mingma Nuru Sherpa2. Dorji Sherpa3. Ang Tshiri Sherpa4. Nima Sherpa5. Phurba Ongyal Sherpa6. Lakpa Tenjing Sherpa7. Chhiring Ongchu Sherpa8. Dorjee Khatri9. Then Dorjee Sherpa10. Phur Temba Sherpa11. Pasang Karma Sherpa12. Asman Tamang

They
 have been setting up their camps at higher altitudes and guides fixing 
routes and ropes on the slopes ahead of the final ascend to the summit 
in May.

As soon as the avalanche hit, rescuers and fellow climbers rushed to help. A helicopter was also sent from Katmandu.

Ang
 Tshering of the Nepal Mountaineering Association said that the area 
where the avalanche occurred is nicknamed the 'popcorn field,' which is 
just below Camp 2 at 21,000 feet.

Nepal
 had earlier announced several steps this year to better manage the flow
 of climbers, minimize congestion and speed up rescue operations.

The
 preparations included the dispatch of officials and security personnel 
to the base camp located at 17,380 feet, where they would stay 
throughout the spring climbing season that ends in May.

At least six climbers are dead after an avalanche swept the slopes of Mount Everest on Friday and hit a route used to ascent the world's highest peak, officials said

The avalanche hit the area just below Camp 2 around 6:30 a.m. Friday morning

More than 4,000 climbers have scaled the summit since 1953, when it was first conquered by New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay. Hundreds of others have died in the attempt.

The
 worst recorded disaster on Everest was on May 11, 1996, when eight 
climbers were killed in one day because of a snow storm near the summit.
 Six Nepalese guides were killed in an avalanche in 1970. 

Climbers
 wanting to scale Mount Everest will be forced to bring back eight 
kilograms of rubbish in a bid to clean-up the world's highest peak.

The
 rule, one of several new measures covering mountaineering in the 
Himalayan nation, will apply to climbers ascending beyond Everest's base
 camp from April onwards, said tourism ministry official Madhusudan 
Burlakoti.

Decades
 of mountaineering has taken its toll on Everest which is strewn with 
rubbish from past expeditions, including oxygen cylinders, human waste 
and even climbers' bodies, which do not decompose in the extreme cold.
