An 18th-floor window shattered from a midtown Manhattan office tower Thursday, raining glass shards on the street below and injuring three people.

Firefighters responded to 40 W. 57th St. about 8:45am, when construction workers renovating the inside of the high-rise building knocked off a window, FDNY officials said.

About a third of the 12-by-8 foot window came crashing down, striking two pedestrians and one building worker.

'A lady was passing by, she wasn't looking, then â€” bam!' one local worker, Mariama Yalloh, told DNAinfo New York.

'It hit her in the back of the head,' 
added Yalloh, 39. 'Blood was dripping. They took her here and wrapped 
her head. She was calm though.'

Other pedestrians ran for cover when the shards began to fall down, according to WABC-TV.

'It came down in chunks,' one witness, Mike Galving, told the station.

Fire officials said a man and a woman were taken to Roosevelt Hospital with minor, non-life-threatening lacerations, FDNY said.

The third victim, who also had minor injuries, refused medical attention.

'I guess if you hit it just right, this is what happens,' FDNY Battalion Chief Tom Marra told WABC-TV.

'But they're pretty thick and they're pretty substantial.'
