Sir Alex Ferguson believes it has been a case of ‘one step forward, two steps back’ for Manchester United this season – but insists Louis van Gaal will turn the club’s fortunes around.

United salvaged a 1-1 draw at home to Chelsea on Sunday when Robin van Persie struck in stoppage-time.

Van Gaal’s side are currently eighth in the Premier League but trail leaders Chelsea by 10 points.

And former boss Ferguson – speaking at an event in London to publicise the updated edition of his autobiography – said that injuries have undermined their progress this season.

‘It’s been a bit of one step forward and two back,’ he said. ‘It’s been difficult with injuries. I got told the team today at 3pm, and Phil Jones is injured again.

‘I said, “Are we going to get a break here?”. If the back four doesn’t play consistently together then you aren’t going to get results.

‘People keep saying “you’re fragile at the back”, and that’s understandable. But these boys need time to adapt, Luke Shaw and Marcos Rojo are still young men.’

But Ferguson is certain Van Gaal is the man for the job.

‘He (Van Gaal) will get there because he’s got the stubbornness and determination to do well. I have no doubt he will get it right,’ he said. ‘I am certain they made the right choice’.

Meanwhile, of the point against Chelsea, he added: ‘That was a bad result for them and a good result for us.’

West Ham boss Sam Allardyce – whose side beat Manchester City 2-1 on Saturday - was in the front row at the Theatre Royal on Drury Lane, and Ferguson said: ‘Mind you Sam, you got lucky yesterday’.

And, referencing comedian Russell Brand kissing Allardyce in a post-match interview, he quipped: ‘But where is your boyfriend?’.
