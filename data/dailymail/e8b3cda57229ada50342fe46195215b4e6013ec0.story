The former boyfriend of Amanda Knox has been spotted out on the town with a mystery woman in the Dominican Republic.

Raffaele Sollecito, 29, was pictured with the attractive young woman in the capital Santo Domingo. The woman was pictured putting her hand on his chest and also draping an arm around him as they walked along at night.

Knox, now 26, and former boyfriend Sollecito served four years for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher before being freed on appeal in 2011.

The body of Miss Kercher, 21, from Coulsdon, South London, was found half-naked in the cottage in perugia, Italy, she shared with Knox. She had been raped and her throat slashed, her body left beneath a blanket in her bedroom.

IT graduate Sollecito and Knox drew attention for their behaviour after the Leeds University student's death in November 2007.

Then, in March this year, Italy’s highest court sensationally ordered the pair to stand retrial.

Sollecito said he had been portrayed as a 'ruthless assassin' and said he had suffered since he and American student Knox were arrested after Miss Kercher’s body was found in the cottage she shared with Knox in Perugia.

The pair seemed happy and relaxed as they talked on the street. It is not known how the pair met

'I have been described as a ruthless killer but I am nothing of the sort,' said Mr Sollecito. The accusations against them were 'absurd', he said during his first appearance at the appeals trial in November.

After leaving jail in 2011, Knox immediately returned to her hometown of Seattle.

Knox has been in a relationship with classical guitar student James Terrano, 25, for more than two years.

But in March this year, Italy's highest court sent the case back to the appeals stage, over aspects of the evidence it argued had not been properly examined before.

A third accused, Rudy Guede, was convicted in a fast-track trial and is serving a 16-year sentence in the murder.

Sollecito called the accusations against himself and Knox 'absurd'

Knox says she was ‘psychologically 
tortured’ by Italian police investigating the death of Meredith Kercher 
who tried to make her confess.

In
 an email to the court in Florence, where she is facing retrial for the 
murder of Miss Kercher, Knox said that she was too ‘afraid’ to return to
 Italy.

She wrote: ‘We need to recognise that a person can be brought to confess falsely because they were psychologically tortured.

‘They lied to me, yelled at me, threatened me, slapped me twice on the head.

‘They told me that I would never see my family if I did not remember what had happened to Meredith that night’.

Writing from Seattle where she is taking Creative Writing classes, Knox said: ‘I am not in the courtroom because I'm afraid.

‘I fear that the vehemence of the accusations will impress you, will pull the wool over your eyes and will blind you.’

Judge Alessandro Nencini said such an email from a defendant was ‘irregular’.

He added: ‘If you want to speak to the trial you have to come to the trial.'

In her message, Knox also defended her relationship with Kercher and suggested she would have had no reason to hurt the British student.

‘I didn't kill Meredith. Meredith was my friend,’ she said. ‘She was nice, she helped me, she was generous and funny. She never criticised’.

The Supreme Court ruled that the initial forensic evidence had been wrongly dismissed in the acquittal and a prosecution theory about a sex game that went wrong should be re-examined.

The prosecutor has requested a 30-year term for Knox and a 26-year prison term for Sollecito for the murder.

A decision is expected on January 10.
