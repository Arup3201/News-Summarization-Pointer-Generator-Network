Reverend Al Sharpton said today that reports that he was a 'rat' who spied on New York Mafia figures for the FBI in the 1980s is old news, while insisting that as he did the right thing he wasn't really a rat at all.

'Rats are usually people that were with 
other rats,' he said in the animated press briefing. 'I was not and am not a rat, because I wasn't with
 the rats. I'm a cat. I chase rats.'

Sharpton had called a news conference at his Harlem headquarters to talk about a story The Smoking Gun website posted on Monday claiming he had recorded conversations with mobsters.

The website said Sharpton was 
recruited by a police-FBI task force to record conversations with Mafia 
figures using electronic equipment hidden in a briefcase. It said Sharpton was known as Confidential Informant No. 7 in court papers.

Defense: Rev. Al Sharpton speaks during a news conference in New York on Tuesday and says that a report saying he spied on New York mafia figures for the FBI in the 1980s is old news

Defiant: He said he was simply cooperating with an investigation and was not an informant

Sharpton
 said he went to the FBI after he was threatened by mobsters working in 
the music business.

'In my own mind I was not an informant,' Sharpton said. 'I was cooperating with an investigation.'

The former child preacher turned civil rights activist insisted that he did the right thing.

'It is interesting to me, as we deal with
 the whole criminalization of many in our community, that the premise of
 a lot of this media is that I should have been with the mob rather than
 with the government,' he said in response to the media reports.

Sharpton said that he did indeed use a recording device in a briefcase but defended his actions.

Not impressed: Sharpton reads from his 1996 book, Go Tell Pharaoh, in which he writes about the episode

'I've done a lot of things in life. Some 
that if I could do again, I would do differently,' he said. 'But in 
this situation, I did what was right... The conversations were recorded. And I would record them today if somebody threatened.'

He dismissed claims that he had met with some of the men mentioned in reports, including Vincent 'Chin' Gigante, who pretended he was crazy by wearing a bathrobe in the streets to escape responsibility for his crimes.

Rev. Al Sharpton's denial

'I have never met any of these guys in 
the newspaper,' Sharpton said. 'The guy with the pajamas? I don't walk around with guys 
that walk outside with pajamas! I never met him.'

He read a passage from his 1996 book Go and Tell Pharaoh, which detailed his part in the investigation, on Tuesday and said: 'Nothing new about that story.'

For the reporters gathered at the press conference, he had one simple request.

'The only thing I was embarrassed by was those old, fat pictures,' he said. 'Could y'all use tomorrow’s cover, the new slim [ones]?'

'Because a lot of my younger members didn’t know how fat I was,' Sharpton added.

Caught: Vincent 'Chin' Gigante (C) was a Genovese crime 
family boss who pretended to be mentally ill to escape arrest - but Sharpton helped foil his plot when 
he taped other mob figures discussing the ruse

Locked up: Gigante died in 2005 while serving a 12-year sentence after admitting he wasn't insane. This mug is from 1960, when he was convicted of helping mob boss Vito Genovese run a narcotics ring

The
 Smoking Gun posted dozens of pages of documents that it said showed 
Sharpton's dealings with mob figures. Sharpton said his lawyers would 
review the documents.

Sharpton, who now hosts a show on MSNBC, said he was not an associate of mobsters but was threatened by mob figures who controlled the music business.

He said he went to the FBI and said: 'I'm being threatened. These are the kinds of guys you should be going after.'

The allegations published by The Smoking Gun had claimed that beginning in the 1980s, Sharpton worked as an informant for
 many years on mob groups for an organized crime task force made up of 
FBI agents and detectives with the New York Police Department.

'[O]ne Gambino crime family figure 
became so comfortable with the protest leader that he spoke openly – 
during ten wired face-to-face meetings – about a wide range of mob 
business,' it said.

At the time: A heavier Sharpton (in blue track suit, center) is pictured during a march in 1998. Years earlier he had began informing against mob bosses, reports said

That
 included everything 'from shylocking and extortions to death threats 
and the sanity of Vincent "Chin" Gigante, the Genovese boss who long 
feigned mental illness in a bid to deflect law enforcement scrutiny.

'As
 the mafioso expounded on these topics, Sharpton’s briefcase--a 
specially customized Hartman model – recorded his every word.'

The Smoking Gun had reported that Sharpton denied his law enforcement ties on Saturday when it asked him point-blank about it.

There
 are strong personal ties between Sharpton and Barack Obama, including 
several Oval office visits on topics as diverse as jobs and education – 
mostly with other black community leaders.

Sharpton
 was also on hand for first lady Michelle Obama's 50th birthday party as
 a guest of the Obamas. And he had a seat near the guest of honor at a 
State Dinner this year honoring French President Francois Hollande.
