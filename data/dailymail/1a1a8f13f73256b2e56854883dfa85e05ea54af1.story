With Manchester United once again in the grip of a defensive crisis, Louis van Gaal could call upon Michael Carrick as a stopgap in Saturday's Premier League match with West Ham.

The midfielder has long been a fall-back for United at centre-half and, having recovered from an ankle injury suffered in the summer, could make his first appearance under the Dutch boss.

United's most experienced centre-back, Jonny Evans, limped out of Sunday's defeat to Leicester with an ankle problem while Phil Jones has a hamstring injury and Tyler Blackett is suspended.

Carrick is, of course, more comfortable in central midfield but has never complained when called upon to slot in at the back.

His performances in such a role, however, have been somewhat mixed.

Carrick was pressed into action in defence when United played at Everton on the opening weekend of the 2012-2013 campaign but was bullied by Marouane Fellaini, who scored the only goal in a 1-0 win.

But for the heroics of David De Gea, United could have been on the receiving end of a thrashing as Carrick struggled to adapt to his role. Fellaini, now at United, towered above him for the winning goal in the second half.

And a week later, there were more problems as United started with Carrick alongside Nemanja Vidic in a 3-2 win over Fulham.

In a Champions League tie with Braga, playing with Jonny Evans, he was embarrassed by the Portuguese side's frontline of Alan and Eder as they took a two-goal lead.

United went on to prevail 3-2 but their abysmal start exposed an alarming lack of depth at the back.

The season before, Carrick played alongside Phil Jones in a home match against Blackburn and again struggled as United fell to a 3-2 defeat on Sir Alex Ferguson's 70th birthday.

He was at fault for Yakubu's goal to put Blackburn two goals up and looked shaky all afternoon.

Back in December 2009, Carrick was forced to anchor a makeshift back three at Fulham with Darren Fletcher and Ritchie De Laet alongside him.

All were completely overpowered as Fulham romped to a 3-0 win thanks to goals from Danny Murphy, Bobby Zamora and Damien Duff.

But it's not all been bad. On other occasions, Carrick has performed well in the defensive position.

Last season, David Moyes asked him to fill in against West Ham alongside Jones and United kept a clean sheet in a 2-0 success.

In 2011-2012, he played competently alongside Evans as United thrashed Wigan 5-0 at Old Trafford and back in 2009, he marshalled a back three of himself, Fletcher and Patrice Evra in a 3-1 Champions League win over Wolfsburg.

In the summer, former United favourite Gary Neville tweeted that Carrick would be the 'perfect' fit as centre-back in Van Gaal's 3-5-2 formation.

But though such a system worked well for Holland at the World Cup, Van Gaal has already abandoned it in the Premier League.

And on the balance of past evidence, even if the manager returned to it, Carrick would not be the man to play in such a crucial position.

These are desperate times for Man United and Van Gaal simply can't afford to have Carrick performing badly at the back. United's emergency defender must stand up and be counted this weekend along with the rest of the back line.
