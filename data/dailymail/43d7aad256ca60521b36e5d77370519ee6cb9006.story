Leonardo Ulloa believes Leicester need to display more physical and mental strength if they are to avoid relegation this season.

A decent start to life in the top flight has quickly tapered off, with Nigel Pearson's promoted side without a win since September 21.

Furthermore, the goals have dried up since that memorable 5-3 defeat of Manchester United, with Saturday's 2-0 defeat at high-flying Southampton the fifth game out of six they have failed to score in.

The poor form means Leicester will be in the relegation zone during the upcoming international break - a time Ulloa knows will require renewed focus at the training ground.

'It is a difficult situation,' the Argentinian said. 'We knew that this game would be difficult, but we need to be thinking about the next game now.

'At moments we played well but they created more chances. We think positively and ahead to the next game.

'The first half we played okay enough with the ball and defended. The second half started well and after they had the ball they created chances.

'We need to think about the next game.'

That next match looks a vital one, with fellow strugglers Sunderland heading to the King Power Stadium before they face another relegation-threatened side, QPR.

'[The international break] is important for us,' Ulloa said. 'We need to forget about this game and the last games.

'We will think about the next game, just the next game. We need more mentally and physically.'

In contrast to Leicester, many connected with Saints will see this international break as unfortunately timed.

Ronald Koeman's side are in wonderful form right now, with the defeat of Leicester their fifth straight win in all competitions.

It has helped Southampton continue their best-ever start to a top-flight campaign - success which has surprised many onlookers, but not summer signing Dusan Tadic.

'After 11 games nobody thought Southampton would have been second in the league, but we believe in our team and our group and until now everything is going well,' the Serbia international said.

'We understand each other very well and other players also do. We have great organisation and because of that we are getting good results

'We work very hard as professionals and everything is going very well up to now.'
