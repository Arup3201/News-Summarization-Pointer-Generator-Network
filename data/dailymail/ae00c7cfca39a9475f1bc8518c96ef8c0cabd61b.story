We return to Downton Abbey in the dead of night, six months after the death of Matthew Crawley. The honeyed stone of the great house is sheathed in velvety darkness.

Only a single bedroom light glows, high up near the eaves. A shadow moves across the window.

Whassat noise? A baby crying? A bat? Mrs Patmore strangling a pheasant for lunch? There’s no way of telling. The walls of Downton must keep their secrets just that agonising bit longer.

Widowed: Michelle Dockery will return as Lady Mary but how will she cope with Matthew's demise?

For yes, the fourth series of Downton Abbey is almost here. This year it will be accompanied by the brilliant new book Behind The Scenes At Downton Abbey, a fascinating insight into the making of our favourite TV show, and serialised here exclusively.

Some of the chapters give a tantalising insight into what promises to be another classic series, although to be honest I’m not sure if I’ve recovered from the trauma of our last visit to Downton – the tear-stained Christmas special that ended with the death of Matthew Crawley.

A crumpled fender, a trickle of raspberry jam running down his noble brow, a man cut down in his prime after surviving the war, the convenient death of his fiancée Lavinia Swire and the curious incident of the Trouser Tingle? Nobody saw that coming.  

What exactly happened? Your guess is as good as mine. All that was clear was Matthew lying at the side of the road, gone forever.

The episode ended with Mary holding her baby, unaware her husband was dead. As Christmas downers go, it was right up there with Santa Claus not coming to town. In the new series we find out all that’s left of Matthew is a photograph in a frame, glinting in the lamplight on Lady Mary’s dressing table.

A photograph – and an heir, of course. A proper male heir, unaware of his future inheritance as lord of Downton and all he surveys. Good for him – but how is everyone else coping?

Mary, of course, is still in mourning. Brother-in-law Tom Branson will be a comfort, for he’s been through a similar bereavement with the death of his wife, Lady Sybil, in series three.

Not too much of a comfort, perhaps, as before long keen admirers will no doubt be crunching up the gravel drive.

Meanwhile Lord and Lady Grantham continue to flourish despite all that’s happened. That unpleasant affair with Pamuk the Turk. O’Brien and The Inexplicable Soap Incident. The mysterious cousin who may or may not have survived the Titanic.

Those wrinkles have been smoothed over, like the newspapers ironed each morning for his lordship’s perusal.

Waspish: Jan is looking forward to more sharp-tongued comments from the Dowager Countess

Setting: The spectacular Highclere Castle is once again the backdrop for Downton Abbey drama

Dowager Countess Violet – played by Dame Maggie Smith – continues to stalk the corridors of Downton with her silver-topped cane, looking for people to argue with.

In this series, she finds herself with a new sparring partner. Her old school chum Lady Shackleton (Dame Harriet Walter) is one of the few who is not intimidated by waspish Violet. Doubled-headed dame disputes? We can expect some delicious clashes.

Elsewhere, Downton is in flux. We are in 1922, but it’s not quite the Roaring 20s, not yet. However, the pall of war has been left behind.

The world is changing – but some characters are keener than others to embrace the exciting new developments. In this, Lady Edith leads the way.

She is almost unrecognisable from the dowdy frump of series one, seduced by a different life in London and her relationship with Michael Gregson, her delectable editor at The Sketch.

In one scene in the opening episode, she has dinner with him at the Criterion, a big step for a woman whose mother once told her she was never to eat in public. Now here she is drinking champagne from a saucer glass and flirting with an older man.

Downton is moving into the Jazz Age in more ways than one. Gary Carr plays Jack Ross, the drama’s first black character, a jazz singer who performs with his band at a party at the house.

He then becomes embroiled with the Crawleys in unexpected ways – particularly with the wilful Lady Rose MacClare.

Coping with motherhood: The last episode ended with Mary holding her baby, unaware her husband was dead

Downstairs there’s a new boot room where the servants can gossip and plot without being overheard. Carson and Mrs Hughes are still locked in a dysfunctional relationship, and all the old favourites are there, too. 

The Downton producers have promised there will be fewer departures and deaths in this series.

Thank heavens for that – how much more could we take? They also promise a few guest appearances, including one from Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, who stars as opera singer Dame Nellie Melba.

So this is what we know. Empires might rise and fall, wars begin and end, but the Crawleys have maintained their position in the social order.

Yes, the Marcel wave and the dropped waist may have come to Downton, but some traditions will never change. As the curtain rises on series four, the family still dress for dinner and sit down to snipe and bicker over Mrs Patmore’s pigeons stuffed with cherries. And that is just the way we like it.
