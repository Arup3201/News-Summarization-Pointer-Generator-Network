He was detained in Wandsworth Prison in south-west London while 31-year-old Mo won the gold medal in the 10,000m at the European Championships held in Zurich on Wednesday and the 5,000 metres yesterday.

Previously, Omar has spoken about the support and advice given to him by his older brother and double Olympic gold medallist, Mo, 31, to help him rebuild his life.  

In an interview last year, Omar, who said he was training to be a graphic designer in an attempt to stay out of trouble, said: ‘I’m moving forward with my life and I have Mo to thank.’

‘The friendship is still good. My dad said: ‘Why can’t you be more like Mo?’ and that’s what I aim to do now.’

But just over a year and a half later, Omar is being held in Britain’s largest prison accused of burgling a semi-detached house in Brentford, Middlesex.

He is expected to face the charges at Kingston Crown Court on September 8.

Mo, who was awarded a CBE last year after winning the 5,000m and 10,000m for Great Britain at the London 2012 Games, is said to be aware of the accusations against his sibling.

Speaking after Mo – who is known for his trademark dance the Mobot - clinched his 10,000m victory in the Olympic Stadium, Omar told of his admiration for his brother.

The 31-year-old won gold in both the 5,000 metre and 10,000 metre finals at the European Championships in Zurich, Switzerland

He said: ‘Mo’s success has inspired me to do something with my life.

‘The atmosphere was amazing. The whole place erupted and it was cool to hear everyone go mad for Mo, and for everyone to do the Mobot.’

He added: ‘I’ve held his medals. They’re pretty heavy.’

Omar was born in 1992, a year after his father Mukhtar fled the impoverished African state of Djibouti which borders Somalia with Mo who was aged just eight.

IT consultant Mukhtar, who was forced to leave his wife and three of his six children behind, settled in West London before meeting Omar’s mother Fosiya Mohamed.

Mo and Omar’s lives went in different directions as the older brother excelled in sport. But he always remained close to his family in the UK and Somalia  

The brothers’ paths went into different directions, with Mo going on to achieve exceptional sporting success in the 2012 London Olympics Games making him a national hero.

The inspirational athlete currently lives between Teddington, London and Portland, Oregon with his wife Tania and their three daughters Rhianna, Aisha and Amani.

A Metropolitan police spokesman confirmed that Omar is being held on remand charged with burglary.
