Police confirm that at 11.50pm, the victim was travelling on a city-bound train from Olympic Park with a man and two women after the Bulldogs-Panthers clash. 

Two men boarded the train at Strathfield Station and struck up a conversation with the group.

'By the time the train reached Redfern, the 48-year-old man was concerned the conversation had become offensive,' said a NSW Police spokesperson. 

'He approached the other two men in an attempt to de-escalate matters.' 

Witnesses say the man was assaulted between Redfern Station and Central Station, at which point all parties left the train. 

Emergency services were called to the scene and paramedics took the man to St Vincent's Hospital with a suspected broken nose

Police are yet to identify the perpetrators and are continuing inquiries into the alleged assault.

They have released descriptions of the two men to the public. 

'The first is described as being of Caucasian appearance and aged 25 to 30 years. When he was last seen, the male was wearing a black shirt.
