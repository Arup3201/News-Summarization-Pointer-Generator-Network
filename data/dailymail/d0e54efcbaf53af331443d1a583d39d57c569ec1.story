A school principal has described her terror as her car was swallowed by a sinkhole as she drove home in Ohio.

Pamela Knox had been driving down the familiar Toledo road on Wednesday when her car was suddenly plunged into darkness.

As she waited to be rescued from the 10ft deep hole, water from a burst pipe started cascading into her car.

Horrifying ordeal: Pamela Knox though she was going to die as her car fell into a sinkhole

She remembered thinking: 'Oh my goodness, they're not going to get me out of here in time.'

As the car continued to sink and fill with water firefighters lowered a ladder into the hole and Mrs Knox was able to escape.

The hole, which opened up at a 
junction in Toledo, was caused by an old sewer built in the 1840s 
collapsing. As the road started to collapse, the Glendale-Feilbach Elementary School principal said her car was 
shaking.

"She saw the 
car in front of her starting to go [into the hole], and it managed to 
drive on, but she couldn't," Sergeant Joe Heffernan told the Toledo 
Blade.

'It wasn't like a 
woosh and that was over. [The car] was falling and rolling,' the 
60-year-old said, adding that she repeatedly yelled 'Jesus' as the car 
began to sink.

'I thought I was going to die,' Mrs Knox said. 'It was very scary. I didn’t want to keep looking at [the water] because it made it worse ... it was filling up that back seat.'

Shocked: Pamela Knox was shaken but not hurt after the car she was driving was swallowed up by a sinkhole

Her husband Kenny, who watched from 
the edge of the hole as his wife was rescued, told the Los Angeles Times
 her survival was a 'miracle'.

Mrs Knox had called the 53-year-old from the bottom of the hole and told him: 'I've been in an accident. I need you.'

Moments after she was pulled to safety by firefighters, more chunks of the road fell on top of her car.

Once rescued she was taken to a hospital as a precaution. Although she escaped without serious injury, Mrs Knox said she would avoid that stretch of road for awhile. 

'I’ll be very careful if I decide to go that way again,' she said. 'I don’t think I’ll be down there any time too soon.'

Recovery: The principal's Chevy Malibu is eventually recovered from the sinkhole using a giant crane

Officials used a crane to pull the car from the hole. Repairs to the road are expected to take days.

Sink holes are caused by the dissolution
 of soluble bedrock and the frequency and likelihood of such changes 
occurring depends on a number of natural factors like the type of rock 
present and the weather conditions in the area.

Ordeal: The swallowed up car was sprayed with water from a broken mains pipe, a possible cause of the sink hole

They often occur after heavy rain and floods, or following earthquakes, and can open up suddenly without any warning.

One
 of the largest sinkholes in the U.S. is in rural Louisiana, a vast and 
growing hole which last year was recorded to be 526-feet wide.

Rescue: Emergency services measured the depth of the sinkhole before deciding how best to rescue the traumatized driver

Escape route: A ladder was carefully lowered into the hole which was estimated to be 10ft deep

Shaky: Shocked Pamela Knox was helped up the ladder by firefighters after her terrifying ordeal

Distraught: Pamela Knox was clearly distraught by the experience and was taken to hospital as a precaution
