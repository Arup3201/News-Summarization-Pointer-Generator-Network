Log the date and remember the name of Sergiy Stakhovsky. Shocks in tennis do not come any more earth-shattering than this.

Somehow the impossible came true and Roger Federer’s Centre Court house came tumbling down.

Not since he won the first of his seven Wimbledon titles in 2003 had the Swiss lost in the first week of Wimbledon. Heck, he hadn’t even lost before the quarter-finals. He did so last night and the manner of it was a Wimbledon throwback to the lost age of serve and volley.

Stakhovsky didn’t just rewrite the history books, he ripped up the modern manual of how to play grass-court tennis. Demonically charging to the net at every opportunity, the world No 116 punched away volleys for three hours, even when Federer flayed shots in anger straight at him.

At 4-3 ahead in the decisive fourth 
set, the Ukrainian displayed stunning reactions to duck out of the way 
of a backhand which carried a message of spite. The ball flew long, but 
Federer’s steamy glare across the net lingered.

The 17-times Grand Slam champion 
rarely demonstrates such antipathy. For once, he wasn’t in charge on the
court which is so often his serene domain. Disbelief enveloped the old 
arena, sweeping away even former champions John McEnroe and Boris Becker
in the BBC commentary box.

‘You won’t believe what I just 
witnessed’ said McEnroe. ‘I’ve got goosebumps, I know Boris does, 
because that was just old school. You hear people say you can’t do this 
any more, you can’t serve and volley, the courts are too slow.’

Stakhovsky was cheered on to the triumph that will define his journeyman career by Anfisa, his wife of 21 months.

Throwing in the towel? Federer takes a breather between games before his shock Wimbledon exit

For much of his married life, he has 
changed tennis from the inside of an ATP Player Council meeting room. 
The most dramatic change they have influenced during that time has been 
the increase in prizemoney at Grand Slams for first- and second-round 
losers. That was supposed to help players like the 27-year-old himself.

The deepest irony is that it is 
Federer who will be the beneficiary, even if the £38,000 cheque is no 
more than loose change to him.

‘I’m in the Council because I think I
can change things,’ said Stakhovsky. ‘On the court, I’m outside the top
100 because there are 100 guys better than me. That’s it.

‘The revival of serve and volley is 
not up to me. It’s about the tournaments and the surface. There is 
hardly a surface left on which you can serve and volley successfully.’

On court, Stakhovsky created a stir 
at the recent French Open. Having had a point awarded against him in his
first-round loss to Richard Gasquet, he marched to his tennis bag, 
grabbed his phone and took a photo of the mark left on the red clay. 
When he later tweeted the photo, he earned himself a fine of 1,500 
euros.

Stakhovsky advances to a third-round 
meeting tomorrow with Jurgen Melzer. The only certainty is that he will 
not match the magnificence of his performance.

It is usually Federer who takes the 
breath away from the Centre Court crowd, ripping the heart out of his 
opponents in the process with the majesty of his play. True enough, even
while wearing the white-soled tennis shoes by decree of the All England
Club after transgressing in the first round, there were moments of 
brilliance which drew a standing ovation.

Crucially, they did not deflect 
Stakhovsky from his quest. Even when he conceded a first-set tiebreak, 
the Ukrainian continued to rush the net at every opportunity. His 
approach shots were penetratingly deep, his movement sharp and his 
volleys crisply punched away.

In the second-set tiebreak it was 
Federer who blinked, shanking a forehand so badly that the ball  
ballooned over the baseline to give Stakhovsky set point. The firmest of
volleys converted it.

A roar went up but, in truth, the 
Centre Court crowd believed it was merely a blip on the usual 
procession. The Swiss would simply raise his level and skate away to 
victory.

Not so. At 5-5 and after 34 games 
without a service break, it was Stakhovsky who lifted his play and 
Federer who wobbled, pushing a forehand inexplicably long. That third 
set was secured with a superbly angled volley, the fourth set saved with
a deliciously controlled volley which plopped on to the Centre Court 
turf and died.

Another prayer: But these fans and their banner didn't get their wish

Historic: Federer last failed to reach a Grand Slam quarter-final in 2004, in a French Open loss to Gustavo Kuerten

Even in the tiebreak, no one truly believed in the miracle that was unfolding — except Stakhovsky.

That was until, at match point down, 
Federer pushed a backhand wide, ending an era which will surely never be
replicated.  Stakhovsky tipped an imaginary hat to the enraptured 
Centre Court crowd, Federer simply scratched his head. Unsure of the 
right etiquette, the Swiss departed. 

Stakhovsky halted his celebrations and joined in the applause, suddenly aware of what he had done.
He will almost certainly never win Wimbledon but Stakhovsky, too, will now never be forgotten.
