'Don’t shear, don’t fear, be the burly man every girl will crave!'

That's the message of a new song getting men in the mood for Movember.

Richard Annett and Jesse Hawkins from California have created a rousing parody of Let it Go from Disney's Frozen, titled 'Let it Grow.'

In their three minute 40 second video,  Hawkins sings about how he's ditched his razor and doesn't care what his boss will say, while Annett stars as a backing dancer.

As Hawkins puts his heart and soul into the performance, he stares at the camera in a bid to convince viewers that beards and mustaches are the way to go.

He reveals that he's  'shocked' how quickly his facial hair has grown in one month and he's 'never going back' to the fresh-faced look.

Team effort: In their three minute 40 second video Hawkins to sings about how he's ditched his razor and doesn't care what his boss will say, while Annett stars as a backing dancer

Inspiration: Here's a still from the original Let It Go music video from Disney's Frozen

'Here I stand with my caveman face. Let the beard flow on, the itch never bothered me anyway,' he croons. 

Many viewers have thanked the musical duo for making them smile and encouraging people to support a good cause. 

'Awesome and amazing! You guys rock!' one fan wrote.

The fur grows brown on the jawline tonight, not a razor to be seen

A kingdom of gentlemen, it looks like I will be king

The hair is sprouting like the manliness inside

I couldn’t keep it in, Jesus knows I’ve tried

Don’t let them trim, don’t let them shave, be the burly man every girl will crave

Don’t shear don’t fear just let them know, you’re letting go

Let it grow, let it grow, can’t hold it back anymore

Let it grow, let it grow, shaving clean is such a chore

I don’t care, what my boss will say

Let the beard flow on, the itch never bothered me anyway

It’s funny how some whiskers for a month can grow so long and that the Gillette that once controlled me can’t get to me at all

It’s time to see what this hair can do, to test the peach fuzz and break through

No right, no wrong, no rules for them, we are men 

Let it grow, let it grow, I am one with Gandalf the white

Let it grow, let it grow, You’ll never see me slice

Take your hand and feel my face

Let the beard flow on

My bristles thicken to a hefty facial crown

Expanding from a stash into a legendary mound

In one month I am shocked at how it’s grown so fast 

I'm never going back, Barbasol's in the past

Let it grow, let it grow I refuse to mow this lawn

Let it grow, let it grow, that chiseled chin is gone

Here I stand with my caveman face

Let the beard flow on, the itch never bothered me anyway
