Myleene Klass is embroiled in a bitter legal battle with her estranged husband as they hammer out the final details of their divorce.

It is understood that businessman Graham Quinn, who provides security for pop stars including JLS and Bruce Springsteen, is demanding the entire proceeds from the sale of their five-bedroom detached property as part of the settlement.

Classically trained musician and TV presenter Miss Klass, 35, is believed to have bought the house in Cuffley, Hertfordshire, in her own name for £1.2 million in December 2009.

Bitter: Myleene Klass and her estranged husband Graham Quinn, are embroiled in a legal row as they hammer out the final details of their divorce. The couple, pictured in 2005, were together for 11 years but married for just six months

Neighbours in the area include England and Tottenham Hotspur striker Jermain Defoe and Sir Terry Leahy, the former chief executive of Tesco.

The house was put on the market with an asking price of £2.5 million just weeks after the couple split in April last year. It was sold in January for £1.8 million.

Since then Miss Klass and her daughters – five-year-old Ava Bailey and two-year-old Hero Harper – have been renting an £8,000-a-month house in Highgate, North London.

Miss Klass, who shot to fame as part of the pop group Hear’Say, is said to have offered Irish-born Mr Quinn, 39, half the proceeds from the sale of the house as a goodwill gesture, but he is demanding the entire sum.

Wealth: Myleene has built up an estimated personal fortune of £11 million from television deals such as her appearance on 'I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here' and promotional deals

 A source said last night: ‘Graham is going after her money.

‘He is not going to accept that they both walk away with what they walked into the marriage, and that’s that. It’s a lot of money.’

Miss Klass and Mr Quinn were together for 11 years, but were married for only six months before he walked out.

His lawyer said: ‘My client has no comment to make about matters relating to his private life.’

And a spokesman for Miss Klass declined to comment.

In an interview with The Mail on  Sunday last October, the singer said  that going through the marriage breakdown was as painful as being shot through the heart.

‘When it first happened and I was in the middle of the storm I was just so very, very hurt,’ she said.

‘I felt that I would sooner have taken a bullet. Actually, at the beginning, every morning when I woke up,  I thought that I had taken a bullet to my heart.’

Out and about: This week Myleene was seen filming an episode of Lemonade at Thorpe Park in Surrey with Leigh Francis, aka Keith Lemon
