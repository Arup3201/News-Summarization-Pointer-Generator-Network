Traitor: MI6 chiefs refused to denounce double agent Kim Philby, pictured in 1955, despite him helping fellow Soviet agents escape to Russia

Britain's spy chiefs refused to denounce traitor Kim Philby for years despite him helping fellow Soviet agents escape to Russia, newly released documents have revealed.

The previously top secret Downing Street file contains documents showing how MI6 maintained that Philby was innocent, and believed it would be 'un-English to label him a traitor based on suspicion.

Major General Sir John Sinclair, the head of the Secret Intelligence Service in the mid-1950s, also stated that the master-spy had helped uncover the identities of other agents, including Donald Maclean.

In documents prepared for then-Prime 
Minister, Harold Macmillan in 1963, following Philby's defection to the 
Soviet Union from Beirut, the Major General had said that the spy should
 not have to prove he was innocent.

'It is entirely contrary to the English tradition for a man to have to 
prove his innocence even when the prosecution is in possession of hard 
facts,' he had argued in his defence, which dates from 12955, according to the Telegraph.

In 1951, Philby resigned from his role
 as the senior SIS liaison officer in Washington DC, after his fellow 
Cambridge Spies Maclean and Guy Burgess vanished.

Although suspicions cast a long shadow over Philby, there was not enough evidence to prosecute him.

Fresh evidence fingering him as the infamous Third Man came to light in 1955 via a Soviet defector in Australia and a question was put to Parliament in which Philby was named as the Third Man.

However, MI6 was still defending Philby, with Sir John telling Mr Macmillan, who was at that time foreign secretary, by letter that other evidence 'reduced very considerably' the suspicions that Philby might have been a Soviet spy.

Information from Philby had led to the senior British diplomat Maclean being unmasked, and had exposed scientists Klaus Fuchs and Allan Nunn May, who were key figures in revealing the how the atomic bomb was created to Moscow.

A report written by MI5 lawyer Helenus Milmo, who led the 1951 investigation concluded that  Philby was a Soviet agent, but the findings were disputed by Sir John - who said it had not managed to provide evidence that Philby was the Third Man.

It is constructed of suppositions and circumstantial ­evidence, summing up in a circular argument everything the ingenuity of a prosecutor would devise against a suspect. It seems likely to remain as a permanently accusing ­finger pointed at Philby,' he wrote.

By then working as a journalist for both The Observer and The Economist, Philby moved to Lebanon in 1956, and continued to work for MI5 part-time. 

In 1962 an MI6 officer Nicholas Elliot manged to get Philby to admit to his double dealings, only for Philby to refuse to sign the confession. 

The following year Philby vanished from a party at the  British embassy in Beirut, leaving his wife Eleanor behind, and escaped to Russia. He died in 1988 aged 76.
