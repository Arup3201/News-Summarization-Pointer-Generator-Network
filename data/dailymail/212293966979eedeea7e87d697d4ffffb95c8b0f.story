Unhappy: Natasha Duffy with the lump of meat which she found in a Tesco cheese and onion pasty

A disgusted vegetarian has slammed Tesco after she found meat in her cheese and onion pasty.

Natasha Duffy, 21, bought the food from a Tesco branch in Tovil, near Maidstone, Kent, but only noticed the contamination half way through eating one of two in the pack.

The shop assistant said the £1.50 own-brand product is labelled suitable for vegetarians and became physically sick after realising what she may have eaten.

'I put one slice in the oven and got to eating it half way when I noticed tiny pieces of pinky coloured meat on my plate,' she said.

'So I lifted up the remaining pastry and found more pieces. They gave off a foul smell on closer examination. I wanted to throw up.

'I was quite shocked. My partner Benjamin Turner took a sniff and he too thought it didn't smell right.

'I won't be going back to Tesco anytime soon. I'll now be sending the evidence to Tesco for examination.'

The supermarket chain has been experiencing a torrid time with revelations of horse meat found in products.

It resulted in their shelves being cleared of thousands of items and a pledge from Tesco's top boss to source more of its meat from the UK.

Chief executive Phillip Clarke told a UK farming conference last month Tesco wanted to 'reconnect' with Britain's meat industry - provided it can meet the demand.

Nasty taste: Natasha said she almost vomited when she found the meat in the pasty-style slices - halfway through eating one

Now the supermarket chain have promised a thorough investigation into their latest slip-up.

A spokesman said: 'We were concerned to hear about this issue, and if our customer is able to return the product to the store, we will begin a thorough investigation with the supplier.

'Alternatively, we can arrange to pick up the product at the customer's convenience.'

A mum-of-two was fuming today after finding a cigarette butt in a supermarket ready meal.

And furious Ellouise Maginnes said: 'This is not just any fag end, it's a Marks and Spencer fag end.'

Ellouise, 37, was tucking in to a dish of root vegetables when she was hit with an 'overwhelming' stench of cigarettes.

The mother-of-two realised she was chewing on something tough and when she took it out of her mouth saw what she claims is a cigarette end.

Dhe said: 'The smell hit me first - it’s the kind of smell you notice straight away.

'Then there was a horrible, smoky taste in my mouth that couldn’t have been anything else but a cigarette.

'I took it out of my mouth and knew straight away what it was.'

Ellouise and her husband David, 43, from Cardiff, bought the root vegetables as part of a Marks and Spencer meal deal.

Ellouise said: 'I had to get my husband to check I wasn’t imagining it.

'As soon as he smelled it, he threw it down in disgust clearly realising what I said was true.'

Marks and Spencer were investigating today after Ellouise made an official complaint.

A company spokeswoman said: 'We’re sorry to hear about our customer’s complaint.

'Quality is extremely important to us, so we’ve asked the customer to send us the product and packaging as soon as possible so we can investigate further.'
