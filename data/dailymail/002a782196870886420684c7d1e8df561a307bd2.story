The U.S. Navy has altered its hair guidelines following controversy that saw a woman kicked out for refusing to change her style.

Jessica Sims, who had been serving for 12 years, wore dreadlocks in a small bun.

Senior officers then asked her to straighten her hair and tie it up tighter. She refused and, as a result, was honorably discharged for 'serious misconduct'. 

Now the Navy has put a hold on the case to review the  circumstances.

Controversial: Jessica Sims, who had been serving for 12 years, wore dreadlocks in a small bun. Senior officers then asked her to straighten her hair and tie it up tighter. She refused and was honorably discharged

Updating regulations: The Navy has this week altered its guidelines which states a bun can be three inches from a servicewomen's scalp

This week the Navy updated regulations extending to 19 approved hairstyles. It included a new style - the two strand twist - and increased the bun size from two inches in diameter to four. Dreadlocks however are still forbidden.

They are unauthorized along with ponytails, pigtails and braids that are 'widely spaced and/or protrude from the head.'

In an interview with the Navy Times, Sims argued that she had been wearing the same style for the majority of her career and was not sure why she was being asked to change it now\

She said: 'I don't think I should be told that I have to straighten my hair in order to be within what they think the regulations are, and I don't think I should have to cover it up with a wig.'

 

'I do think that it's a race issue. The majority of the hairstyles that have the strictest regulations are hairstyles that black women would wear' she added.'

Navy regulations state that hair can't protrude more than two inches from the head, so in order to make it lie flat, black women typically weave their hair into tight braids, cornrow it or straighten it using hot tools or chemical relaxers. Wigs are also common. 

Navy regulations specifically ban 'widely spaced individual hanging locks,' according to section 2201.1. Sims says her locks are narrow enough to be in keeping with the rule. 

Speaking to the site, Sims insisted that as she tied her hair back she fit in with regulations. However her commanding officers disagreed. 

Commenting on the case Lt. Stephanie Homick, Spokesperson for the Chief of Naval Personnel, said: 'We hold every sailor to the same standard. It’s not on an individual basis. We are the military.'

Changes: There are now 19 approved Navy hairstyles. The 'two strand twist' was added to the list. Dreadlocks however are still forbidden 

The first line of the recently updated rules state: 'Hairstyles and haircuts shall present a professional and balanced appearance.

'Appropriateness of a hairstyle shall be evaluated by its appearance when headgear is worn. All headgear shall fit snugly and comfortably around the largest part of the head without distortion or excessive gaps. 

'Hairstyles will not interfere with the proper wearing of headgear, protective masks or equipment.

'When headgear is worn, hair shall not show from under the front of the headgear, with the exception of the Tiara and Beret.

'Hair (including bun) is not to protrude from the opening in the back of the ball cap.'
