A grieving mother has been targeted by internet trolls only a day after her 16-year-old son was killed in a moped crash.

The online tormentors posed as Bridget Agar’s son, Jordan, on Facebook and sent her a message that said: ‘Mum, I’m not really dead. I’m sat at the computer, I just ran away.’

They also sent Mrs Agar an invitation to a birthday party for her son, who died the day after  his 16th birthday.

Tributes: Friends and relatives leave flowers at the spot where Jordan crashed his moped

And they went on to request intimate images of Jordan’s brother’s girlfriend.

When family members  challenged the tormentors they were subjected to insults, taunts and perverse remarks.

Mrs Agar, 41, who is separated from Jordan’s father, said: ‘I want these callous people caught.

‘I hope they are found and 
prosecuted. How could someone send a grieving mother a message 
pretending to be from her dead son? There are no words to describe what 
these people are, they are not human.’

Jordan had completed his  compulsory basic training for  the moped on his 16th birthday last Thursday.

The day after, he went out  on the scooter to meet friends but crashed into a wall near  his home.

He was airlifted to hospital following the crash in Tutbury, Staffordshire, but was pronounced dead soon after arrival.

Within 24 hours trolls had set up the
fake page in Jordan’s name and began taunting his mother, who suffers 
from multiple sclerosis.

Jordan, who helped care for Mrs Agar, had recently applied to study engineering and mechanics at college.

Mrs Agar said her son, who had a 
condition which meant  he would need a liver transplant when older, was 
‘the most  caring and loving boy a mother could want’.

Mrs Agar, who lived with  Jordan and 
her other son Rhys, 18, added: ‘These trolls have upset not just me but 
the Jordan’s family, his friends, even the whole school is shocked.

‘They need to be brought to justice, they need to go to prison for this, it can’t just be a slap on the wrists.

‘People need to know you can’t do this.’

A genuine Facebook page set up in 
tribute to the teenager has attracted more than 600 members so far. 
Facebook has since taken down the fake profile and begun a joint 
investigation with Staffordshire police.

A spokesman said: ‘We are absolutely clear that there is no place for trolling on Facebook.

‘It’s against Facebook’s rules to 
intimidate or harass others, and we provide everyone with the tools to 
report such content via specific links across every page of our site.

‘When abuse is reported to us we react swiftly, and we will disable accounts that are found to be in breach of our terms.

‘We strongly encourage people using 
Facebook to use our tools whenever needed and to report objectionable 
content so we can investigate reports and take action.’

Victim: Jordan died after his moped hit a wall at a junction in Tutbury, Staffordshire, just a 30-second drive from his nearby home

A spokesman for Staffordshire police 
said: ‘We can confirm we received a report of a fake Facebook profile 
page which had been created in Jordan’s name.

‘The page has since been suspended by Facebook and officers will be working with them to find the person responsible.’

Trolling is the practice of  using the internet to abuse or threaten a target, often under a false name.

Last week, Frank Zimmerman, 60, was 
convicted of sending Tory MP Louise Mensch an electronic message that 
was ‘grossly offensive or of an indecent, offensive or menacing 
character’.

Gloucester magistrates heard he had threatened to harm one of the Corby MP’s children.

Online comments can  be classed as a criminal offence  if they are deemed to cause  harassment, alarm or distress to a victim.
