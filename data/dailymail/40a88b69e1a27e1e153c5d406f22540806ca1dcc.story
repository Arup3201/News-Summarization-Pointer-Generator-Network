Nigel Pearson's job as manager of Leicester City appears to have been doing the hokey cokey where one moment he's in, and the next he's out. 

The club sitting bottom of the Barclays Premier League issued a statement on Sunday night, insisting they had not sacked Pearson following his altercation with Crystal Palace midfielder James McArthur.

Even members of Pearson's backroom staff were told he'd been fired after grabbing McArthur by the throat in what is surely among the strangest touchline meltdowns in Premier League history.

But how does it compare? Sportsmail pick five touchline bust-ups between managers and players.

Alan Pardew headbutts David Meyler, 2014

If we needed to compile a list for bust-ups between managers, Pardew would feature. If we needed examples for bust-ups between managers and officials, Pardew would feature.

Yet again, in scraps between managers and players, Pardew is never far away. The then-Newcastle United boss was sent to the stands after headbutting Hull City's David Meyler at the KC Stadium.

He received a £100,000 fine, was given a formal warning by Newcastle and was slapped with a three-match stadium ban with a touchline ban for a further four games by the Football Association. The FA also fined him £60,000 as the now-Crystal Palace manager made history for the wrong reasons.

Norbert Meier headbutts Albert Streit, 2005

You may be thinking 'Who?' but you're more than likely to recognise the video. MSV Duisburg manager Meier had an altercation with Koln player Streit on the touchline during their match.

Referee Manuel Grafe sent Streit off with a straight red, only for replays to show it was in fact Meier that went for the headbutt. Still, both went to ground like they'd been shot, play-acting.

Meier was sacked by the club two days later, and banned by the German FA for three months from any managerial activities.

Delio Rossi punches and slaps own player Adem Ljajic, 2012

Fiorentina manager Rossi launched slaps and punches at his own player Ljajic in 2012 after the midfielder was substituted just half hour into their 2-2 draw with Novara.

Ljajic, once on trial at Manchester United, appeared to sarcastically clap Rossi's decision to take him off - bad move. Rossi responded by attacking his player, having to be restrained by his own staff.

Rossi apologised for his part in the fight afterwards. 'My gesture was ugly, disgraceful and I am very saddened,' he said. 

'I have never said that I am a saint but you can ask the children and all the players that I have coached in the past what type of person I am. I have never allowed myself to hit anyone, not even my children.'

Paolo di Canio and Leon Clarke scrap in the tunnel, 2011

Paolo di Canio is never far from controversy, and the Swindon manager got into a scrap with his own player Leon Clarke down the tunnel in 2011.

It started on the pitch where Clarke got into an argument with fitness coach Claudio Donatelli. Di Canio intervened, only to pick a fight himself. They rowed as they entered the tunnel, before it turned ugly.

Afterwards, Di Canio said Clarke would never play for Swindon again. 'Fortunately, he's out now even if he's under contract. He's never going to play with my team, never,' Di Canio insisted.

Joe Jordan vs Gennaro Gattuso, 2011

A bit of a cheat to include this mad moment, given Jordan was Tottenham Hotspur's assistant manager, but it's still up there with the best touchline scraps.

Jordan is not a man to mess with but, during AC Milan's Champions League game against Tottenham, Gattuso pushed the assistant away by the throat during an altercation on the touchline.

Video footage shows Gattuso confront Jordan and headbutt him after an exchanging of words. 'I lost control. There is no excuse for what I did. I take my responsibilities for that,' the Italian said. 

Gattuso was banned for four Champions League matches as a result, while Jordan received a touchline ban by UEFA.

And let's not forget...

Brian Clough punches Nottingham Forest fans, 1989

A moment of madness from the then-Nottingham Forest manager. Clough took a swing at his own supporters when they invaded the pitch celebrating a 5-2 win over Queens Park Rangers.

Yet two of the fans that received a punch from Clough returned to the City Ground to apologise for running on to the pitch in the first place...
