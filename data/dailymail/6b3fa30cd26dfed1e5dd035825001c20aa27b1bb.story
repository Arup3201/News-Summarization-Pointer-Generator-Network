An autopsy has confirmed that Buckwild star Shain Gandee and two other men died of carbon monoxide poisoning after the SUV they were riding in became partially submerged in deep mud.

A friend of Gandee's found the 
bodies of the 21-year-old, his uncle David Gandee, 48, and Donald Robert
 Myers, 27, who were last seen at a bar in Sissonville, West Virginia, at about 3am on 
Sunday morning.

Gandee's
 Ford Bronco was found more than a day later in 
deep mud off a dirt road, not far from the reality star's 
home.

The Kanawha County Sheriffâ€™s Office 
said today that the death of each of the men was accidental and the 
cause was carbon monoxide poisoning.

Authorities said the exhaust pipe was buried in mud, causing the deadly gas to seep into the vehicle.

On the Gandee's General Store Facebook page, his cousin Ashley posted: 'I just wanted to let everyone know that the family feels that Shain died peacefully in his sleep without pain or suffering.

'They are making arrangement (sic) now for his funeral. Nothing is confirmed but they are thinking Saturday. So private or public hasn't been decided I will try to keep everyone updated.'

The news came at the same time of an 
outpouring of support and prayers for Gandee by fellow castmembers and 
other MTV reality stars, who regarded him as a kind man with a big 
heart.

Cara Parrish, Gandee's heartbroken love interest on 
Buckwild, tweeted: 'This is the emptiest I've ever felt. Please pray for
 [Gandee's parents] Dale and Loretta.'

Meanwhile, shooting for the second season of 'BUCKWILD' had begun prior to the accident, but MTV spokeswoman Candice Ashton told MailOnline that filming has now been suspended.

She declined to provide details on the future of the show, but said that the network's thoughts 'continue to be with Shain's family first and foremost.'

Recovery: Authorities needed ATVs to reach the vehicle, due to the muddy terrain

It is believed that the three men died of carbon monoxide poisoning, but autopsy results are pending.

Now struck with funeral costs, Gandee's family has organized a fundraiser to cover burial expenses.

TMZ reported that his cousin Ashley is putting together an off-road trucking event to raise money for the Gandee family.

Buckwild, in which Shane is nicknamed Gandee Candy, has been dubbed the 'Redneck Jersey Shore.'

The reality show follows Shain and eight other young adults in Virginia, all of whom love small-town American life.

Gandee in particular shunned cell phones and social media, and was happiest when he was hunting and four-wheeling, according to the West Virginia Gazette.

His father told Buckwild producers that his son 'died doing what he loved,' according to ABC News.

Neighbor Swanna Frampton, who had known him since he was a small child, told the AP: 'Shain always rides with these kids in four-wheelers and trucks. They were just out riding and having a good time.'

Frampton said Gandee 'loved to live and have fun. He was a great person. He did what [the show] wanted him to do, but he wasn't like that. He was a real person. If you needed help, if [you] needed something, he would come help you no matter what.'

Authorities had been searching for the 
men since early Sunday morning. They were last seen around 3am on Sunday
 at Larry's Bar in Sissonville and they told people they were going driving 
off-road.

Kanawha County Sheriff's Department Cpl B.D. Humphreys said state police were getting ready to send out an aviation unit to 
search for the men when authorities received a call Monday morning that a
 vehicle was found wrecked a few miles from Gandee's home in 
Sissonville, about 15 miles outside of Charleston.

Authorities
 found the 1984 Ford Bronco that belonged to Gandee in a muddy ditch 
with all three men inside. Gandee was in the driver's seat.

The terrain in the area was 'very muddy, very rough,' Humphreys said.

WSAZ reported that investigators needed ATVs to get to the vehicle.

Kanawha County Commission President Kent Carper said the news was devastating for the small community near Charleston.

'It's a very sad day for the 
Sissonville area and for these families,' he said. 'This is a small 
community, and most of us know directly members of these families. We're
 keeping them in our hearts and prayers.'

In a statement, MTV
 said: 'We are shocked and saddened by the terrible news about Shain 
Gandee, and those involved in this tragic incident. We are waiting for 
more information but at this time, our main concern is for the Gandee 
family and their friends.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with them.
 Shain had a magnetic personality, with a passion for life that touched 
everyone he met and we will miss him dearly.'

MTV said the half-hour series in the old Jersey Shore time slot was pulling in about 3 million viewers per episode since its premiere and was the No. 1 original cable series on Thursday nights among 12- to 34-year-olds.

Recently, two of Gandee's classmates have found themselves on the wrong side of the law.

Last week, 24-year-old Salwa Amin was sent back to jail for violating the terms of her bond following a February arrest.

She was charged with two counts of drug possession with intent to deliver and initially jailed on $200,000 bond.

That was later reduced to $100,000, but Amin remained behind bars without bond Monday.

State Police said a multi-agency task force arrested Amin and two other people at a Summersville residence after getting a tip from an informant.

A search found oxycodone pills, heroin and $3,000 in cash.

Another cast mate, Michael Douglas Burford, was charged in February with driving under the influence.
