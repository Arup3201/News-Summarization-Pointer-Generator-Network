The European Union’s ‘addiction’ to red tape was laid bare yesterday.

Since the 2010 general election Brussels has handed down almost 3,600 pieces of new regulation and directives affecting British businesses.

A campaign group said last night that the 13million words contained in the deluge of bureaucracy would take more than 92 days to read in all.

UK firms are being 'strangled' by the European Union's 'addiction' to red tape, Business for Britain has claimed

Business for Britain said the avalanche of directives is strangling UK firms and making it harder to compete with corporations in the US and in emerging markets in the Far East and South America.

David Cameron has pledged to hold talks to get some powers back from Brussels and to reduce the burden of red tape on business, ahead of a 2017 referendum on membership of the EU.

Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain, said: ‘The EU has an addiction to red tape that desperately needs to be tackled.

‘The forthcoming renegotiation with Brussels must focus on overhauling its approach to regulation, for the good of jobs and growth in Britain.’

The organisation’s research found that since the start of this Parliament in May 2010, a total of 3,589 regulations and directives affecting UK businesses have been handed down from Brussels.

It would take a businessman, working an average eight hours a day and reading at an average speed of 300 words a minute, 92 days to read all the 13,321,530 words in all the business-related EU red tape enacted since the current government came to power.

This equates to around a month’s worth of reading every year to keep on top of new regulations.

Last week, inventor Sir James Dyson was forced to lodge a legal challenge to new EU labelling regulations for vacuum cleaners.

He claims the new labelling rules make it look as if Dysons are less energy efficient than they actually are.

Over the past few months, UK companies have had to fight proposed EU legislation such as measures to ban the Union Jack from packs of meat, enforce quotas in boardrooms and prohibit refillable olive oil jugs in restaurants.

In the past three months alone, the EU has found time to issue regulations on anchovy fishing in the Bay of Biscay, the labelling of spirits and the use of rosemary extracts in certain low-fat meat and fish products.

Other regulations cover the authorisation of ammonium chloride as a feed additive for ruminants, cats and dogs, and the use of certain additives in seaweed-based fish roe substitutes.

Another regulation changes the botanical 
name of the tomato, and another concerns maximum residue levels for 
‘clodinafop (a herbicide), clomazone, diuron, ethalfluralin, ioxynil, 
iprovalicarb, maleic hydrazide, mepanipyrim, metconazole, prosulfocarb 
and tepraloxydim’ in or on certain products.

There are also directives forcing television manufacturers to change their ‘ecodesign’ requirements for standby functions, and forcing makers of water heaters to change energy consumption labelling

Mr Elliott said: ‘No one would argue that a single market needs some regulation to function properly, but the volume and frequency of new directives being generated is a serious restraint to British businesses.

‘This is why I welcome the formation of the government’s EU regulation taskforce and its drive to identify the EU’s most pernicious business regulations.’

Business for Britain is a campaign for a better deal from the EU, backed by more than 750 UK business leaders.
