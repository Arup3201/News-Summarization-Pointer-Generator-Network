Some children moan about eating Brussels sprouts, and the odd curmudgeon isn't partial to Christmas cake or brandy butter, but most of us are in firm agreement about one thing when it comes to grub served up on 25 December: festive food is jolly delicious. Until now.

A handful of traditional flavour favourites have been given a topsy-turvy makeover by brands, eateries and recipe websites, muddling savoury and sweet to confuse our taste-buds and befuddle any sense of gastronomic order.

So you'll find croissants stuffed with turkey and gravy, doughnuts filled with turkey and cranberry, a turkey and sweet potato cake, mince pie-flavoured crisps, mint chocolate chip Pringles, and both a Pot Noodle and a cheese that taste remarkably revoltingly of Christmas lunch.

Sweet cinnamon and mint choc flavour Pringles are not the first peculiar flavours to have been launched by the brand - American audiences have also experienced white chocolate, soft-shell crab, blueberry and hazelnut, and seaweed

Victoria Joy, Christmas Editor on BT's lifestyle channel, has compiled a list of this merry season's most berserk comestibles, which are made both in Britain and in America.

Pringles have launched the limited edition flavours of sweet cinnamon and mint choc, though these aren't the most bizarre ones the brand have come up with.

Fans in America have also experienced white chocolate, grilled shrimp, soft-shell crab, seaweed, and blueberry and hazelnut.

Pilgrim's Choice cheese has unveiled a seasonal block of cheddar stuffed to bursting with the flavours of Christmas.

The yellow, turkey-flavoured block is flecked with Brussels sprouts, grated carrot and bits of dried fruit.

Over in America, foodie website chow.com has created a recipe for a full Thanksgiving meal in one slice of cake.

The meatloaf-style beast comprises layers of mashed turkey, mashed potato, mashed sweet potato and toasted marshmallows. Not for the faint of heart.

But if you don't fancy getting your elbows dirty, New Yorkers should head to the Zucker Bakery.

Over there the kind-hearted chefs are rustling up Thanksgiving doughnuts made of spiced pumpkin dough and filled either with turkey and gravy or - for those with a more traditionally sweet tooth when it comes to doughnuts - turkey and cranberry.

And Momofuku Milk Bar has done the same... only using croissants instead of doughnuts.

Back in Britain, brands including Tesco, Pot Noodle and Marmite have added Christmas sparkle to some of their products.

Tesco's mince pie-flavoured crisps are the perfect gift for any, er, mince pie-lover with a gluten intolerance. If you can find it (it was a limited edition put out some years ago), the Christmas dinner Pot Noodle would be ideal for any culinarily lazy singleton this Yuletide.

Same goes for this snazzy offering from Marmite. It'll be hard to track down as it was only made in 2008, but if you can, Marmite's champagne-infused spread will be sure to put the bubbles in your Christmas morning toast.

Proving that when it comes to Thanksgiving Americans are nothing if not dedicated is this turkey and cranberry croissant made in New York's Momofuku Milk Bar

As if mint crisps weren't weird enough, Tesco have brought out a mince pie flavour as part of their seasonal Finest range... a sort of crispy biscuit thin

The Christmas Dinner Pot Noodle is perfect for any singleton Grinch who doesn't like cooking, friends or Christmas

To those who love it, Marmite is already special enough... but here it is with added Christmas champagne sparkle, just for fun
