An 18-year-old woman reportedly lied about being abducted and held for 16 hours in Michigan - and investigators who determined her story was fake said Monday they plan to ask prosecutors to file charges against her.

Police in the Detroit suburb of Ecorse, where Hayley Turner was found Friday, will send the case to the Wayne County prosecutor's office, Lt. Greg Blade said at a news conference.

Charges could include filing a false police report, Blade said.

'During the interview there was a lot of questions that couldn't be answered and I don't think the young lady was being very truthful with me during my investigation,' Blade said.

'I just figured if you're telling the truth you don't get confused about telling the truth,' he said.

Tuner had cuts that appeared to be self-inflicted, Blade said.

'A lot of manpower was extended, a lot of time - I mean we truly wanted to help,' Blade said.

'It started not to click,' Chief Michael Moore said in the conference. 'My frustration level was very high. We are a cash-strapped city...and this cost us quite a bit of money.'

Moore said Turner didn't act alone and was never in physical danger.

'They weren't looking for Ecorse. This is another instance where they were looking for Detroit,' Moore said.Â 

'She could not do this alone and at no time was she never out of the company of a friend,' he said.

Moore said he did not know if the person who helped Turner spoke to Monroe County investigators.

Police also did not discuss Turner's motive for lying about the abduction.

The sheriff's department in neighboring Monroe County in a Friday press conference that Turner told her family she was going to a video store before her disappearance.

Turner was speaking to a friend on the phone Thursday night when she said she was stopping to help someone by the side of a road in Bedford Township, the sheriff's department said.

Turner told her friend that she was being followed by a man with a gun. Then the call was disconnected.

When Tuner was found about 45 miles from that spot on Friday she told officials she had been abducted.

Turner's mother Christy Turner spoke at the conference, saying 'Hayley, please call. Call anybody. We miss you. We want you home.'

A Monroe sheriff's detective and an FBI agent re-interviewed Turner Sunday.

'As a result of that interview, it was determined that the incident did not take place, as originally reported,' the sheriff's department said in a statement. It said the sheriff's department forwarded its report to prosecutors in Monroe County.
