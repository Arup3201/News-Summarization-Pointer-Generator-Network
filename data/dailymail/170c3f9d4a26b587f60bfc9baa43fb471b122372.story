A mother and her 10-year-old daughter returned home Tuesday after surviving a 250-foot crash into a Tennessee ravine earlier this month.

Rebecca Likens, 29, was driving her two daughters, 9 and 10, and an 18-month-old granddaughter along State Highway 10 in Macon County when she went over the guardrail to avoid hitting another car who veered into her lane. Though the car plummeted 250 to 300 feet into a creek, Likens and the children sustained only non-life-threatening injuries, according to the Macon County Times.

'All I could think about was getting of its way 'cause if I hit it head-on, it would have killed me and my kids,' Likens told WSMV.

Wreckage: When Rebecca Likens first saw her car after crashing it down a 250-foot ravine, she said God was with her because otherwise 'I don't think anybody would have survived'

When she saw the oncoming car, Likens pulled right and dropped slightly off the road. She then turned left, over correcting, causing her to 'slingshot' across the highway and into the ravine.

Immediately after the June 4 crash, Likens could only think of her children.

'I got them out of the car immediately,' she said. 'I was really concerned that the car would explode'

Likens called her brother-in-law, who called police. At first, emergency personnel and Likens' family couldn't find the wreckage in the ravine's tree cover. First responders were finally able to help when they heard the family's screams for help. 

'Then we kept looking for her and couldn’t find her. When I started driving back up the hill, I went with my windows down, because me and the ambulance had gone all the way to the bottom of the [Hwy 10] hill and couldn’t see anything,' Tennessee Highway Patrol Trooper Danny Fisher told the Times. 'Then I came back up with my windows down, and I could hear them screaming.'

Strong: Rebecca Likens' 10-year-old daughter broke an arm and a leg after the ravine crash

Likens' husband, Donald Likens, arrived with his son around the same time as highway patrol.

'We were driving through here with my door open hollering for them,' Likens' husband told WSMV. 'I finally heard them screaming from the bottom of the ravine.'

Likens' husband and son scaled the guardrail to get down the ravine after their family.

'I went down there as fast as I could,' Likens' husband said.

A dozen emergency personnel followed them down.

'They carried the two youngest children up in their arms, and then they had to use a rope and basket system for the oldest child and the mother, due to their injuries,' Fisher told the Times.

Likens was treated for a possible spinal injury from the crash. Her 10-year-old daughter had a broken arm and leg, as well as a blood clot in her lung, according to a Facebook post by her father. Likens also had three broken ribs and a separated shoulder, according to her Facebook. They returned home Tuesday.

The two youngest children were treated with minor injuries.

Likens said she always makes her children wear seat belts. She tells WSMV that's probably what save their lives.

'Lucky...the kids were strapped in, if they hadn’t been they would have been flying all over the place; that’s what kept them in the vehicle till it reached the bottom,' Lafayette Constable Tom Dallas told the Times.

In Facebook posts since the crash, Likens thanked God, as well as friends and family.

'I just want to tell everyone ty for there prays still keep praying for my daughter and the ones who was there getting us out of the bluff and I also want to thank my church family for being there at the hospital thank you,' she wrote.

Likens' husband also went online to post his gratitude.

'i would like to thank the lord for watching over my family they made it thu the wreak and are home doing better,' he wrote in one Facebook post. 'THANK YOU JESUS.'

'i would like to thank all the people that helped at the wreck and thanks to ever one for all calls most of all for all the prayers thanks,' Donald Likens wrote in another post.

Likens saw the car wrek on Wednesday and it disturbed her.

'I ain't seen it until now,' she said. 'Oh my Gosh. But I know I had God with me. Because the way that car looks, I don't think anybody would have survived.'
