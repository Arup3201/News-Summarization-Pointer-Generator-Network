An ordinary middle class American family helped inspire much of President Obama's State of the Union address on Tuesday after mother-of-two Rebekah Erler wrote to him last year about how her family continued to struggle following the 2008 economic collapse.

Minneapolis native Rebekah was given the honor of being one of Michelle Obama's guest at the event and earlier she had visited the White House along with husband Ben and their two young sons Jack and Henry.

During his address, the president repeatedly used the Erlers as an example of a family that had faced hard times following the economic downturn and that continued to struggle to make ends meet despite two working parents.

Before the State of the Union address, the Erler family visited the White House and posed for a selfie 

Seven years ago the young couple were newlyweds with Rebekah studying and waiting tables, while Ben owned his own construction company. The couple were also expecting their first child, Jack.

'If only we had known,' Rebekah wrote to the president last spring, 'what was about to happen to the housing and construction market.'

As the crisis worsened, Ben's construction business folded and he was forced to take whatever job he could find, even if kept him on the road and away from his family for long stretches of time. 

A move from Seattle to Minneapolis and several difficult jobs later, Rebekah's husband is now back at work in the re-modeling industry.

After taking out student loans to attend a local community college for career re-training, Rebekah has returned to the workforce as an accountant.

'They sacrificed for each other. And slowly, it paid off,' said President Obama, who spent a day with the family in Minnesota last June.

In her letter to Obama, Erler had written about her husband's struggles to find a reliable job, the high costs of groceries and childcare, and the burden of paying off student loans.  

The Obama administration has called the Erler’s story one that is 'shared by millions of American families, and helps show that too many middle-class families with two working parents are still stretched too thin.'

Both parents are now working again and they recently bought their first home. They have also had a second son, Henry.

'It is amazing,' Rebekah wrote, 'what you can bounce back from when you have to. We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.'

Rebekah was among 22 invited guests who sat with Michelle Obama at Tuesday's State of the Union address.

In his address, the president said that Rebekah and Ben's story was also America's story.

'They represent the millions who have worked hard, and scrimped, and sacrificed, and retooled,' he said.

'You are the reason I ran for this office. You're the people I was thinking of six years ago today, in the darkest months of the crisis, when I stood on the steps of this Capitol and promised we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation. 

'And it's been your effort and resilience that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger.'

Later in his speech the president returned to the Erler family and at the end of his address he also made reference to Rebekah's letter and her description of her family as 'strong' and 'tight-knit'.

'My fellow Americans, we too are a strong, tight-knit family. We, too, have made it through some hard times,' said the president.

'Fifteen years into this new century, we have picked ourselves up, dusted ourselves off, and begun again the work of remaking America.'

The  36-year-old accountant and mother of two was invited to join Obama for burgers after writing a letter to the president detailing the challenges she and her husband continue to face in reaping the benefits of a recovery from recession that so far has disproportionately benefited those at the top of the income scale.

'We actually have something to offer that young lady,' Obama at a fundraiser for House Democrats in Minneapolis hours after meeting with her. 'And if she wins, then the country wins, and our kids and our grandkids win.'
