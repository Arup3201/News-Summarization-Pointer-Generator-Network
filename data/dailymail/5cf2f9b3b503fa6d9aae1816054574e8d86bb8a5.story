A Texas man is suing four doctors and a hospital for $10 million over a botched bariatric sleeve procedure after he woke up in hospital two weeks later missing both of his legs.

Carlos Saucedo, 32, went in for the weight-loss procedure at Baylor Medical Center at Trophy Club, near Fort Worth, one year ago.

He weighed 275 pounds and wanted to turn his life around.

However, Saucedo says the doctors were 'directly negligent' when performing the surgery and mistakenly pierced his aorta towards the start of the operation, according to The Fort Worth Star-Telegram.

'Lifetime of medical care": Carlos Saucedo has filed a lawsuit claiming negligence by doctors involved in his 2013 gastric sleeve procedure near Fort Worth, which resulted in both his legs being amputated

The error occurred as the surgeons were guiding a camera into Saucedo's abdomen that would allow them to remove more than half of his stomach.

Saucedo soon lost four liters of blood and, as his blood pressure began dropping, doctors saw the punctured artery and stitched it up to stop the bleeding.

They did not realize it was his aorta, the largest artery in the body.

The decision cut off blood circulation to both of Saucedo's legs, leaving them 'cold and pulseless'.

Doctors aborted the surgery and Saucedo was transferred to the intensive care unit at Baylor Medical Center in Grapevine.

By that time his organs were beginning to fail because the blood flow had been cut, and he underwent bilateral amputations below and then above the knee.

Saucedo woke up in hospital two weeks later believing he was recovering from gastric band surgery, but that procedure was never performed.

'Everything just kind of just crashed down in my mind,' Saucedo told WFAA.

'I was kind of in shock.'

Scene: The operation took place at the Baylor Regional Medical Center in Grapevine in November 2013

Saucedo said he believed Dr. David Kim of Kim Bariatric Institute was doing the procedure.

Kim had just done the same operation on Saucedo's wife.

However on the day he learned that Dr Bridget Holden was operating on him.

The lawsuit says another physician, Dr Franchell Richard-Hamilton, was also in the room and that Saucedo did not give her permission to be there.

Dr Richard-Hamilton is the one who sewed the aorta shut, the lawsuit contends.

Dr Kim, Dr Holden and Dr Richard-Hamilton are all named in the lawsuit, as well as Dr. Alexander Hatcher, who saw Saucedo in the emergency room at Baylor Grapevine.

None of the defendants have commented on the lawsuit. 

Defendant: Dr. David Kim of Kim Bariatric Institute in Colleyville, along with three other doctors, have been named in the lawsuit

Saucedo is being fitted for prothesis and 'will require lifetime medical care', the lawsuit says.

His marriage ended following the surgery and he has had to move to Laredo so his parents can care for him.

He is also suffering 'phantom' pain from where his legs used to be and has psychological issues, according to the lawsuit.

Last year doctors performed an estimated 179,000 bariatric procedures in the United States.
