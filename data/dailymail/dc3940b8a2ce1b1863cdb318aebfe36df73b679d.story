A grand jury indicted a Florida man for first degree murder on Thursday in the shooting death of an unarmed, black high school student last month after an argument over loud rap music.

Software developer Michael Dunn, 46, shot high school junior Jordan Davis, 17, through the window of a sport utility vehicle at a Jacksonville convenience store gas station on November 23, before driving away, authorities said.

Dunn, who is white, faces charges of attempted first degree murder for firing at the car which contained three other passengers, all friends of Davis.

Dunn was arrested the day after the shooting for second degree murder and pleaded not guilty. He was being held in Duval County without bond awaiting arraignment.

The state attorney's office later decided to upgrade the charge to first degree murder, which in Florida requires a grand jury decision.

Dunn's arraignment on the new charges is scheduled for December 17.  The Florida Times-Union reported that the State Attorney's Office won't be seeking the death penalty against Dunn.

Davis's father, Ron Davis, has pledged to turn his son's shooting death into a crusade against guns and Florida's controversial Stand Your Ground law which allows people to defend themselves if they ‘reasonably believe’ someone will hurt them.

Widespread opposition to the law has emerged after the shooting of Trayvon Martin, also an unarmed, black 17-year-old, in February by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman in central Florida. Zimmerman, whom police initially declined to arrest, will stand trial next June for murder.

Dunn's lawyer says he fired out of fear for his life when someone in the SUV brandished a shotgun and threatened him.

Dunn and his fianceé, Rhonda Rouer, were in Jacksonville on the night of the shooting to attend a wedding when they stopped at a Gate gas station in Baymeadows to pick up  a bottle of wine before returning to their hotel, authorities say.

They parked their Jetta next to the red Dodge Durango SUV containing Davis and his three friends - Tevin Thompson, Leland Brunson and Tommie Stornes - who were listening to rap music on their way home after shopping at Black Friday sales at a mall.

Dunn asked the teens to turn down the volume of the music, but, his attorney said, the teens turned up the volume, threatened Dunn and brandished a shotgun.

Dunn grabbed a pistol from the glove compartment of his car and opened fire, before driving away, authorities say. Police said no weapon was found on the teens.

Dunn was taken into custody at his oceanfront townhouse about 170 miles south of Jacksonville the day after the shooting.

Dunn's lawyers are considering building their defense on the controversial ‘Stand Your Ground’ laws because they said the teens pointed a gun at Dunn although it was later revealed that there was no weapon in the vehicle.

In an interview with WJXT, Dunn’s former attorney, Robin Lemonidis, recounted the 46-year-old man’s account of the incident.

According to the lawyer, Dunn heard the teens in the SUV say: ‘Kill that mother******,’ ‘That mother****** is dead.’

Lemonidis said in the next moment, Dunn saw a shotgun coming up over the rim of the heavily tinted SUV containing four black men whose ages he did not know at the time.

‘But he knows a shotgun when he sees one because he got his first gun as a gift from his grandparents when he was in third grade,’ the lawyer said.

Davis’ case has been covered extensively by the national media, with MSNBC host Lawrence O’Donnell dedicating several segments on his Last Word show to the teen’s shooting.

‘Another angry white man in Florida has stood his ground in the face of an imagined threat, and another black 17-year-old high school junior who did nothing wrong is dead,’ O'Donnell said on air in November.

The host went on to riduicule Dunn as the ‘self-appointed volume cop of Jacksonvile, Florda,’ who had decided that he had the authority to tell the teenagers to turn down the music.

‘The kids did what most kids would do and what I certainly would have done under the circumstances: nothing,’ O’Donnell said. 

Speaking on MSNBC’s The Last Word, Jordan Davis’ father urged state lawmakers to toughen gun laws and get the now infamous ‘Stand Your Ground’ legislation repealed.

‘What that is just a shield for people to go ahead and use their firearms without any type of other thought about human life,’ Ron Davis said.

The teen’s mother, Lucia Kay McBath, argued that it is not up to individuals to decide whether or not a person has the right to use firearms during a confrontation. 

‘We’re not saying you don’t have a right to bear arms, because we can’t choose for you what you choose to do. But there needs to be accountability, there needs to be responsibility,’ she said.

In states with ‘Stand Your Ground’ laws, 34 per cent of white shooters did not face charges or have not been convicted after shooting a black person, according to an Urban Institute analysis cited by the Huffington Post.

Just 3 per cent of black shooters got the same treatment after shooting a white person and making a ‘Stand Your Ground’ claim, according to the same report.

And in Florida, which became the first state in the nation to pass laws allowing people to defend themselves rather than back away from a confrontation, justifiable homicides grew by nearly 195 per cent since the law took effect in 2005, FBI data shows.
