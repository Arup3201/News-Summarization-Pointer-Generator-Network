England's official Twitter account got itself in a bit of a muddle after getting caught up in the excitement of facing the Auld Enemy on Tuesday - by naming the wrong scorer for the first goal.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had managed to get his head on the end of Jack Wilshere's majestic ball to put Roy Hodgson's men ahead at Celtic Park but the Three Lions' Twitter account announced Rooney as the original scorer.

They later corrected themselves, revealing they had 'got a little too excited' by Wilshere's ball through. 

England's Twitter account originally tweeted saying Wayne Rooney (left) had opened the scoring

In fact, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's (right) header had given England the lead against Scotland

The first tweet read: 'GOOAAAAALLLLLL! The captain @WayneRooney glances a header past the keeper from a @JackWilshere cross. 1-0 to the #3Lions on 32 mins #ScoEng.'

Almost immediately, however, they posted another tweet: 'Correction - GOAL 32 mins by @Alex_OxChambo! We got a little too excited by @JackWilshere's brilliant cross. Come on England!!!'

Captain Rooney did net England's second and third after half-time in the 3-1 victory though, moving himself clear into third by himself on the Three Lions all-time goalscoring list with 46 goals.

He trials record-holder Sir Bobby Charlton by just three goals now.

Rooney did score England's second goal at Celtic Park though to move on to 45 for his country
