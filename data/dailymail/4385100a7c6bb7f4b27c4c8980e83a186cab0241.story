Liverpool are among a host of clubs watching Real Madrid's young midfield sensation Jack Harper.

Harper, 18, impressed in last week's UEFA Youth League victory over Basle, in which he scored and hit the crossbar with an overhead kick.

Manchester City scouts were also in the crowd to watch the rising star, who was born in Fuengirola, Spain, to Scottish parents.

Real, however, are watching Liverpool's 17-year-old midfielder Pedro Chirivella.

The former Spain Under 16 captain moved to the Liverpool academy in 2013 from Valencia despite interest from Barcelona.

Chirivella was persuaded that he would have greater chance of progressing to the first team under Brendan Rodgers, who has shown a willingness to blood academy graduates.

Liverpool agreed a fee that could rise to £2m for the midfielder, who has been compared to Xabi Alonso and indeed models his game on his compatriot, but Real are now keen to bring him back to Spain. 

Chirivella is playing in Liverpool's U21s under Alex Inglethorpe and has trained with the first team. He is part of the club's UEFA Youth League squad.
