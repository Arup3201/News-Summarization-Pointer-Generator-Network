A motorcyclist who was thrown headfirst from his bike was saved after landing in a paddling pool.

The 17-year-old, known only as Yim, was on his bike in Taiwan when the accident happened.

He failed to stop when making a left turn across two lanes of traffic and was hit by an oncoming car.

A motorcyclist who was thrown headfirst from his bike was saved after landing in a paddling pool

The force of the smash saw him fly off his bike and through the air. 

Half of his body landed in the inflatable paddling swimming pool by the side of the road, before smashing into a fence.

Lin was fined more than US$200 (£117) for riding without a helmet or licence, and for making an illegal turn. 

The car driver also received a penalty for driving without due care and attention.
