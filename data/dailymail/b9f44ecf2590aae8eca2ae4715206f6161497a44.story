Hull's Ahmed Elmohamady has pulled out of Egypt's forthcoming African Nations Cup double header.

Elmohamady, the right winger or full-back, was injured during a man-of-the-match performance against Crystal Palace at the weekend and will not be travelling for Friday's game in Botswana or the home clash in Cairo five days later.

A short statement from the Tigers read: "The club can confirm that Ahmed Elmohamady has withdrawn from Egypt's African Cup of Nations qualifiers with a back spasm."
