The fate of the Jordanian pilot held by Islamic State terrorists remains unclear after the jihadis brutally murdered a Japanese journalist over the weekend.

Government spokesman Mohammed al-Momeni said the kingdom is doing 'everything it can' to secure the release of Maaz al-Kassasbeh, who was captured by ISIS after his F-16 fighter jet crashed in territory controlled by the militants in Syria in December.

ISIS has been demanding the release of a convicted female Iraqi jihadi on death row in Jordan in exchange for Kassasbeh's life - a demand the government has expressed readiness to accept provided it is given proof that the pilot still alive.

The news comes just two days after ISIS' British executioner in chief, Jihadi John, savagely murdered Japanese journalist Kenji Goto in a shocking filmed beheading after days of intensive negotiations through intermediaries to save him.

Jordanian government spokesman Momeni today said: 'All state organisations have been mobilised to secure the proof of life that we require so that he can be freed and returned to his home.'

'We are still ready to hand over the convict Sajida al-Rishawi in return for the return of our son and our hero,' Mohammad al-Momani added. 

He condemned the jihadists' murder of Japanese journalist 47-yer-old Goto after days of intensive efforts through intermediaries to save him, adding: 'We spared no effort, in coordination with the Japanese government, to save his life.'

Goto was the second Japanese hostage in a week to be executed by the jihadists in what they have said is punishment for Tokyo's pledge of £130 million in aid to countries affected by ISIS' bloody seizure of swathes of Iraq and Syria last year.

Last week, ISIS claimed responsibility for the beheading of Haruna Yukawa after the expiry of a 72-hour ultimatum.

The jihadist IS wants freed - Sajida al-Rishawi - was sentenced to death for her role in the 2005 bombings of three Amman hotels by Al-Qaeda in Iraq which killed 60 people.

Her husband was one of the three suicide bombers and the court found that she had would have been a fourth but for the failure of her detonator.

 Yesterday Kassasbeh's worried relatives pleaded with Jordan's government to be more open about negotiations for his release following Goto's murder.

The fates of the pilot and the Japanese journalist had previously had been linked. The video of the beheading made no mention of the pilot, raising fears for his life.

'We want the government to tell us the truth,' said Yassin Rawashda, an uncle of the pilot.

He said the family is not demanding a full briefing, but wants to hear if release efforts are headed 'in a positive direction or not.'

The pilot's father, Safi al-Kaseasbeh, said he is worried, but still is putting his faith in the government. 

'Of course, I'm concerned,' he said by telephone. 'This is my son. I'm always concerned about him and any development makes me more concerned.'

Jordan is reportedly conducting indirect, behind-the-scenes negotiations through tribal leaders in neighboring Iraq. 

Over the weekend ISIS' British executioner in chief, Jihadi John, savagely murdered Japanese journalist Kenji Goto in a shocking filmed beheading after days of intensive negotiations through intermediaries to save him 

The footage, which was released by the media arm of Islamic State, was entitled 'A message to the government of Japan', and in the footage Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was blamed for the killing

Last week Jordan vowed to fast-track the execution of Sajida al-Rishawi if ISIS kills Kaseasbeh.

It apparently warned ISIS that she and other jailed ISIS commanders would be 'quickly judged and sentenced' in revenge for the execution of the pilot.

 Intelligence sources said ISIS's refusal to prove that Kaseasbeh was alive meant any deal with the militants was doomed. Jordan subsequently stepped up its rhetoric by warning  of its intent to retaliate if the negotiations end in bloodshed.

Elijah Magnier, chief international correspondent for Kuwait's Al Rai newspaper, told MailOnline: 'I have reliable contact in the Jordanian government who says a message has been passed to ISIS.

'It warns that if they kill the pilot they will implement the death sentences for Sajida and other ISIS prisoners as soon as possible.

Yesterday the mother and brother of  Goto spoke of their loss following confirmation that he had passed away, although the authenticity of the video has yet to be proven.

 'Kenji has died, and my heart is broken. Facing such a tragic death, I'm just speechless,' Goto's mother Junko Ishido told reporters, adding that her son's death showed he was a kind gentle man, trying to save another hostage.

'I was hoping Kenji might be able to come home,' said Goto's brother, Junichi Goto, in a separate interview. 'I was hoping he would return and thank everyone for his rescue, but that's impossible, and I'm bitterly disappointed.' 

A video released by ISIS appears to show the 47-year-old freelance journalist being beheaded by the militant fighter known as Jihadi John.

Kenji Goto, a war correspondent with experience of reporting from Middle East conflict zones, went missing in October last year as he went to help fellow Japanese hostage Haruna Yukawa

Mr Goto was last heard from a week ago, when an audio clip emerged claiming to be by him, saying Mr Yukawa had been killed and asking for failed suicide bomber Sajida al-Rishawi to be released

Mr Goto joins a list of other victims of Jihadi John, including fellow Japanese national Haruna Yukawa (left). British aid workers David Haines (centre), and Alan Henning (right) have also been murdered

US journalist James Foley (left) was the first to appear alongside Jihadi John in one of the sickening videos, followed by Steven Sotloff (centre). American aid worker Peter Kassig (right) was also murdered by ISIS

The 70-second clip shows Mr Goto kneeling in a rocky gorge while the masked murderer delivers a scripted message to the camera.

The killer then lowers his knife and the footage fades to black, as is common in ISIS propaganda films. When the footage begins again Mr Goto's body is shown lying on the desert floor. 

ISIS' executioner in chief, who has a British accent, says: 'To the Japanese government: You, like your foolish allies in the Satanic coalition, have yet to understand that we, by Allah's grace, are an Islamic Caliphate with authority and power, an entire army thirsty for your blood.

'(Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo) Abe, because of your reckless decision to take part in an unwinnable war, this knife will not only slaughter Kenji, but will also carry on and cause carnage wherever your people are found. 

'So let the nightmare for Japan begin.'
