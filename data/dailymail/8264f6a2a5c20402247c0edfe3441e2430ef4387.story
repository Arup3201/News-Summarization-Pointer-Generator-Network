A father was stunned after council officers asked him to pay rent on a six-foot wide strip of land in his garden.

Paul Openshaw, 38, from Royton, returned home from a holiday to find a letter from his local authority, Oldham Council, demanding an annual rent of £50, which he is refusing to pay.

Transport manager Mr Openshaw, who has has lived in the Manchester property for 12 years, said he had no idea that the small walkway to the side of his house was registered as council land.

It has been fenced to the property for at least 25 years.

The row broke out after inspectors at cash-strapped Oldham Council in Greater Manchester carried out an inspection of their assets while Mr Openshaw was on holiday in June.

Gathering evidence: Paul Openshaw measuring the six-foot piece of land in contention

It emerged the six-foot wide strip, which houses a gravel path, garden shed and part of his decking, may once have been on the site of a disused public highway.

Officials may now seek a court order to 'evict' Mr Openshaw’s shed and gravel path unless he pays rent.

They have also charged him £180 in surveyors fees, claiming the council had a 'duty to manage its assets in the interests of the public'.

But Mr Openshaw said he had already paid £550 in legal fees to challenge the council’s claim, and would continue to fight to make the land legally his own.

He said: 'I bought the house 12 years ago and there was already a fence attaching the land to my property.

Contentious: Paul Openshaw's backyard, over which he is in dispute with Oldham Council

'It’s just a small piece of land around 6ft wide - it’s not like it’s a football pitch. Yet all of a sudden they’re saying they own it and they want rent from me.

'But I’ve never heard anything before and I had all the usual checks carried out before I bought the house.

'Having to spend that kind of money isn’t great for anyone at any time of year let alone in the run up to Christmas. It’s just ridiculous.

'If the council are now claiming they own my land which has been maintained to a decent standard they should give the road outside a proper permanent Tarmac surface so it comes up to a more acceptable standard too.

'There have been potholes in the road outside for years. I didn’t complain about them myself but I know the other neighbours did and I was hoping the council would fill them in. I can’t believe they carried out this inspection instead.'

Mr Openshaw, whose wife Michelle, 34, was made redundant from her store assistant job earlier this year, discovered the problem in June when he returned from a week's holiday.

He added: 'The letter was from "Unity Partnerships" on behalf of the council and it stated that the land wasn’t mine and that I’d have to cough up £50 rent a year and £180 for surveyor fees.

'It stated the council took their assets very seriously and that they needed the money.

'I was absolutely baffled. I sent an e-mail saying how on earth was it their land - it was the most ridiculous thing I’d ever heard. I hired a solicitor and have already paid more than £500 in fees.

'My only option is to stick at it and carry on negotiating with the council or basically let them do their worst and take me to court.'

Problem: Part of the land in dispute by Oldham Council, whose officers have laid claim to it

Mr Openshaw had his house fully surveyed when he bought it for £46,000 in 2000.

Since receiving the letter from the council, he tried to take 'possessory title' of the land through an application to the Land Registry as he has lived there for more than 10 years.

But his plea was rejected on the grounds of a legal technicality.

He said: 'It is something I believed I owned for all those years and for them to take it away in an instant is unbelievable. I obviously had my house surveyed when I bought it twelve years ago and this was never mentioned.

'I am prepared to fight this at the moment, but if too much money gets involved it may be a struggle, especially leading up to Christmas.'

Dispute: Part of Mr Openshaw's garden may once have been on the site of a disused public highway

Oldham Council, which is battling to save £45m in budget cuts, said officials did not know why the issue of the land had not been flagged up earlier and assumed it must have been 'missed' on previous occasions.

Councillor Dave Hibbert, cabinet member for housing, transport and planning, said: 'Oldham Council is the registered owner of the land and during a recent inspection it was noted there was an encroachment that hadn’t been authorised.

'This information is available to the public and solicitors prior to any house purchase. We have quoted our standard garden licence rental and hope we can reach an amicable settlement.'
