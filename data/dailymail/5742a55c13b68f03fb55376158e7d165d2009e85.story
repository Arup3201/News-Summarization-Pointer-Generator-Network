Two young women have claimed a ghost photobombed a selfie they took during a night out.

Friends Kayley Atkinson and Victoria Greeves took the photograph while they enjoyed an evening in Newcastle-upon-Tyne on Sunday.

Miss Atkinson, 23, and Miss Greeves, 22, had been having a drink at the Slug and Lettuce pub on the Quayside and said the bar was virtually empty when they took the picture.

Can you spot the 'ghost'? Friends Kayley Atkinson (left) and Victoria Greeves (right) took the photograph while they enjoyed a night out in Newcastle-upon-Tyne

Location: The two friends were at the Slug and Lettuce pub (above) on the Quayside in Newcastle-upon-Tyne

But after striking their best pose for a selfie together, the women noticed there was a third person in the photo - which appears to be an elderly lady dressed in Victorian clothing.

Horrified by the figure which seemed to be peering between the best friends, Miss Greeves - who works as a nurse - deleted the spine tingling photo from her phone. 

Friends: Miss Greeves, 22, and Miss Atkinson, 23, have known each other for the past six years

She said: ‘We took the picture in the bar as we usually would, we are both fans of a selfie.

'I uploaded the picture to Snapchat and thought nothing more of it. But later that night Kayley rang me in a panic and told me to have a closer look. She said there was a figure in the background, and I am quite sceptical about things like that so I just laughed at the time.

‘But when I looked back at the picture I could not believe what I was seeing. It is terrifying. I couldn't look at the picture at the beginning as I was too freaked out. It is so clear, and it looks like what can only be described as a Victorian woman, laughing behind us.’

The women, who have known each other for the past six years, are regulars at the bar - but said they would think twice before going back again. 

Local authority worker Miss Atkinson said: ‘The bar was dead when we went in. It was only when I got home later on that I noticed the photo.

'I couldn't believe it. I was absolutely terrified and Victoria was so scared that she deleted the photo off her phone. A lot of people have said we must have photoshopped the picture.

'I can't blame them, but neither of us would even know how to do that. I didn't believe in ghosts at all before, but I'm not so sure any more.’

A member of staff at the bar said no-one who worked there had ever seen a ghost.
