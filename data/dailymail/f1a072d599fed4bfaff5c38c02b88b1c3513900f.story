Jimmy Savile asked BBC security staff to allow girls and women free passage to his dressing room when the paedophile demanded, a letter revealed today.

A handwritten note, scrawled by the DJ on Stoke Mandeville Hospital headed paper, lays bare how he used his position of power to abuse hundreds of victims.

Savile wrote to his 'BBC security friends' and asked them: 'Please admit these three ladies to my room, ta,', followed by his signature containing a smiling face.

Chilling: This handwritten note, revealed today, shows how Savile asked his 'BBC security friends' to let women through to his dressing room, where he is alleged to abused many victims

The letter is understood to concern three female members of his staff, who were attending an event he was involved in.

He died in October 2011, aged 84, having attacked hundreds of children he met at the BBC and at hospitals, charity events and schools.

Police believe the Top Of The Pops and Jim’ll Fix It presenter attacked at least 1,300 people over the course of 54 years.

At least 450 people were abused by the paedophile DJ on BBC premises.

'It perfectly illustrates the position of power Savile had,' a BBC source told the Mirror today.

'He
flattered and made friends with security staff and this enabled him to 
carry out his horrendous attacks. He even wrote this on headed notepaper
of the National Spinal Injuries Centre. This was not unusual.'

It is telling that the note is on Stoke Mandeville paper, where he is also accused of abusing victims in a private room he was given by management.

In a 2009 police interview, released last month but done two years before he died, he fobbed off police with lies, bluster and legal threats.

In it he boasted he ‘owned’ the NHS hospital at Stoke Mandeville and said he brushed off girls ‘like midges’.

Publication of the interviews reignited speculation that some who worked at Stoke Mandeville deliberately overlooked Savile’s sexual abuse of patients because of the money he raised for the hospital.

During the interview, Savile says: ‘I own this hospital, NHS run it, I own it, and that’s not bad. And one of the reasons that I get, that I take it seriously is that I wouldn’t let anything get out of hand to run the risk of spoiling things for my people here'.

Later it emerged that the authorities believe he committed at least 22 sex crimes there.

Last month a former BBC driver was found dead in an 
apparent suicide ahead of his child sex abuse trial.

The
body of David Smith, 67, chauffeur to disgraced DJ Jimmy Savile and 
other celebrities during the 1980s, was found at his south-east London 
home, on the eve of his court appearance.

It later emerged the former driver was a 
prolific sex offender with a string of previous convictions for sexual 
offences against young boys, dating back to 1966, on his criminal 
record.

A BBC spokesman said today: 'The independent review led by Dame Janet Smith into the culture and practices of the BBC during the years that Jimmy Savile worked at the BBC is ongoing'.
