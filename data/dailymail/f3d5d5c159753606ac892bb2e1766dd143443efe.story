The country has enough fissile material for a dozen nuclear bombs. It sells missile technology to rogue regimes such as Iran and Syria. And the three generations of the Kim dynasty who have run it since 1945 have all been ruthless, brutal — and terrifyingly erratic.

At 9.49 local time on Wednesday, North Korea’s isolated regime defied warnings from across the world to launch an Unha-3 ballistic rocket from a remote village near the Yalu River border with China.

The launch site is 45 miles from North Korea’s main nuclear complex at Yongbyon, where scientists are working towards the production of long-range missiles which can carry nuclear warheads.

Threat: Kim Jong-Un defied warnings from across the world to launch an Unha-3 ballistic rocket on Wednesday. He is known as The Shining Son and it is said his face has been surgically altered to resemble his grandfather, Kim Il-Sung, the first ruler of North Korea

North Korean state media reported the launch as the successful positioning of a weather satellite in space. TV showed images of happy people dancing in the streets. Customers in a coffee shop in the capital Pyongyang burst into applause.

It was a case of fourth-time lucky for the country, since three previous launch attempts had ended in failure. The most recent flop occurred eight months ago and was particularly embarrassing because it had been timed to coincide with the centenary of the birth of Kim Il-Sung, the first ruler of North Korea, a man so revered he is called the Eternal President even though he died in 1994.

His embalmed body can be reached on travelators that take respectful visitors through the vast Kumsusan Memorial Palace to bow before it and weep. In that year power passed to his son Kim Jong-il, still called the Supreme Leader, who was succeeded in 2011 amid weeks of hysterical compulsory mourning by Kim Jong-un, at 29 the world’s youngest leader.

Kim Jong-un is known as The Shining Son, and it is said his face has been surgically altered to resemble that of his grandfather.

But while his people were shown on state
 media celebrating, North Korea’s neighbours were deeply alarmed by the 
so-called satellite launch, for it was nothing less than a test for 
ballistic missiles intended to be equipped with nuclear warheads.

Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague summoned the North Korean ambassador for an explanation following 'clear violation' of UN Security Council resolutions

It represents yet another step in the country’s determination to be able to launch a nuclear strike on cities on America’s Pacific coast — and it demonstrates Kim Jong-un’s megalomanic contempt for international relations.

As the rocket flew south across the Yellow and East China Seas, its discarded booster sections fell near the Philippines and the Japanese island of Okinawa, violating both countries’ sovereign territory. 

South Korean satellites monitored the rocket’s ascent, as did three of its Aegis warships from the sea. Japan put its armed forces on alert and held a news conference within 30 minutes of the launch to calm a panicky population. Even China, North Korea’s closest ally, said it regretted Pyongyang’s violation of UN bans on ballistic missile technology to launch a satellite.

In London, Foreign Secretary William 
Hague summoned the North Korean ambassador to the Foreign Office for an 
explanation following ‘clear violation’ of UN Security Council 
resolutions.

Predictably, 
Kim Jong-un remains unrepentant. His accession last year led in the West
 to naive optimism — of the sort Tony Blair once invested in Syria’s 
murderous Bashar al-Assad, who had taken over from his despotic father —
 that the young prince would be a reformer. Nothing could be further 
from reality.

True, Kim Jong-un appears not to have
 his father’s depraved sexual appetite. Kim Jong-il was attended by a 
retinue of 2,000 young women known as Gippeujemo in Korean, meaning 
Pleasure Brigade, who had been rounded up at the age of 15 by officials 
to service the Supreme Leader’s sexual whims.

All had to be virgins, and none could be more than 5ft 2in — the height of King Jong-il himself. 

In
 contrast, Kim Jong-un is said to be a romantic and deeply attached to 
his pretty wife, Ri Sol Ju, who likes Dior handbags and high hemlines in
 a country where individual self-expression is all but forbidden.

Kim also appears more Westernised 
than his father. A photo that appeared soon after his succession caught 
him cavorting on a rollercoaster with the British ambassador to his 
country. He likes basketball and Johnny Walker whisky, and he attended 
school in Switzerland for a couple of years in the 1990s.

But
 he also spent three years at a training school for elite Korean Workers
 Party cadres in Pyongyang, and the fact is that the podgy young 
dictator has moved quickly to consolidate his grip on power. 

Any
 challenge to his might would most likely come from the armed forces, so
 as soon as he was leader he immediately promoted himself from general 
to marshal and liquidated any potential dissenters. A deputy defence 
minister and other senior officers were assassinated with pinpoint 
mortar fire after Kim insisted nothing should remain of them, ‘down to 
their hair’.

The military are part of North Korea’s privileged elite, who belong to the ruling single party. 

They
 are known as the ‘core class’, and number a quarter of the population. 
The most privileged of all are the Kims themselves, with gilded luxury 
residences, replete with bowling alleys, cinemas and heated swimming 
pools.

More than half the 
population of 23 million are not so fortunate as they are classed as 
‘waverers’, ordinary people outside the charmed party circle. While 
still at school they have to complete detailed biographical sketches of 
their families, which are then used by the state to determine everything
 from food rations and housing to careers.

The final class of people are 
categorised as ‘hostile’. These are the children of the intelligentsia 
such as doctors, Christian ministers, merchants or lawyers. They are 
taken from their families and forced to live in barren regions of the 
country near China where it is cold, windy and mountainous. The hostiles
 constitute 20 per cent of the population in what must be the most 
class-stratified society on earth.

North
 Korea is a totalitarian dictatorship where loudspeakers pump out 
propaganda on the streets and in factories and mines. It practises total
 surveillance, with the spies being spied on by other spies. 

Anyone
 who falls foul of the regime — and sins range from listening to South 
Korean radio stations and failing to praise the leader sufficiently, to 
attempting flight to China in order to avoid starvation — is put in one 
of the country’s six vast prison camps that house 200,000 people. 

And
 it’s not just the offender who suffers. The regime practices 
inter-generational punishment. This means that his or her parents and 
offspring are incarcerated too, often for their entire lives.

These camps are huge complexes, sometimes as large as Los Angeles in extent, except that they are surrounded by electric fences and watchtowers. Inmates toil in mines from before dawn to dusk, and then have to sit through indoctrination sessions where they are often beaten for real or imaginary infractions of rules that are only known to the guards.  A place in college is awarded to any guard who shoots dead anyone trying to escape.

Executions and torture are rife. Rare accounts from defectors have mentioned specially-trained dogs being set on prisoners to maul them to death. There even have been horrifying accounts of female prisoners being routinely raped by guards and the foetuses that result being cut from their wombs.

Numbers in the prisons are also kept down through natural attrition — the heavy manual work often proves fatal on a diet so inadequate that those who manage to supplement it with insects or rat meat are considered highly fortunate. 

Unsurprisingly, North Korea’s economy is moribund and its agriculture disastrous. During the Nineties, the country was a million tons short of rice and cereal grains annually, and anywhere between a million and three million people starved to death.

Deadly game of extortion: Kim Jong-un manages to fund the fourth largest army in the world with one million troops on the South Korean border alone

Yet Kim Jong-un manages to fund the fourth largest army in the world, with one million troops on the South Korean border alone, and 13,000 artillery pieces that could rain chemical shells as well as high explosives on Seoul to the South. His regime regularly sinks ships that sail too close to islands in disputed waters. Sometimes it shells these islands too, killing South Korean soldiers and civilians. 

By indulging in his military escapades, Kim Jong-un is practising a deadly game of extortion — and one which until now has proved successful. Invariably either South Korea or the U.S. have responded by trying to appease the regime with the shipments of supplies it needs to feed its starving population. 

But as Kim Jong-un moves ever closer to being able to brandish nuclear weapons, the stakes are raised higher and higher. And one day this monstrous rogue, isolated from reality by his cowering people and fawning court of generals, may provoke a military response from his neighbours the consequences of which do not bear thinking about.
