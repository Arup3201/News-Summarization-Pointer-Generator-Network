Punters are backing Irish horse Mutual Regard in the final hours before this afternoon's Melbourne Cup.

Bookies say Japanese stayer Admire Rakti is still a favourite and the public is also throwing its support behind Who Shot The Barman – but they are warning it may have more to do with its cool name rather than its chance of winning.

Tattsbet's Gerard Daffy said Mutual Regard's popularity could be pinned down to its jockey.

'It's the Damien Oliver factor,' Mr Daffy said.

Jockey Damien Oliver, a 'Melbourne Cup specialist', celebrates after winning on  Derby Day on Saturday

'He's got such a good record in Cups, he's the number jockey in Australia.

'The odds have shortened from $13 into $9 and you very rarely see that when there's a horse the Australian public haven't seen before.'

Sportsbets' Christian Jantzen agreed.

'Damien Oliver is a Melbourne Cup specialist – he won it last year and he's won at least three,' Mr Jantzen said.

'The horse has got good form and punters have backed it in from $13 to $9.'

Mr Jantzen added that punters are backing Faulkner, the Australian hope, and Who Shot TheBarman.

Mr Daffy said Who Shot Thebarman had been backed $26 to $15, adding that it was popular because it has 'proven its distance'.

'But just as many bets are on it because of the name - punters love horses with quirky names,' he said.

'But it did win the Auckland Cup earlier in the year, and Glen Boss is another proven jockey.'

Mr Daffy said the Melbourne Cup looked very difficult on paper this year.

'It's one of the most wide open cups I've ever seen – nothing would surprise,' he said.
