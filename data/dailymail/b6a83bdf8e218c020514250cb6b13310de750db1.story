Manchester City star Samir Nasri will sign a new contract at the club when they return for pre-season training next week.

The attacking midfielder agreed the deal in principle with the Barclays Premier League champions before he went on his summer break after being overlooked for France's World Cup squad.

Nasri enjoyed a stellar 2013-14 season for City as the club won two trophies in Manuel Pellegrini's first season in charge.

The 27-year-old scored seven times in 34 League appearances, including the final-day win over West Ham which clinched the title, and he also netted in the Capital One Cup final win over Sunderland at Wembley.

Nasri had fallen down the pecking order before Pellegrini's arrival having falling out with ex-City boss Roberto Mancini.

Mancini signed Nasri from Arsenal in a Â£25million deal in the summer of 2011 and now the Frenchman looks set to stay at the Etihad Stadium beyond his initial four-year contract.
