'Putin is playing hardball and Obama is playing tee ball' in Ukraine, New Hampshire Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte claimed on Friday, castigating the White House for showing weakness on the global stage while Russia's president flexes his muscles.

'The Ayatollahs in Iran will watch whether we put on real sanctions' against Russian interests, she warned in a lunchtime speech at the Northeast Republican Leadership Conference.

'They will look at what we do,' Ayotte said, 'and we should worry if we do not act.'

'I'm afraid that the Obama administration's weakness will put us in a position where we'll talk and talk, and Iran will march forward toward a nuclear weapon.'

U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H. talks with reporters after speaking at the Northeast Republican Leadership Conference on Friday, March 14, 2014 in Nashua, N.H.

Ayotte is part of a young group of Republican hard-chargers who are pushing harder than usual this year for a GOP landslide in November, hoping to flip at least six Democratic seats and seize the majority.

'It's no fun being in the minority party, living under Harry Reid's rules,' she jabbed at the Democrats' majority leader.

Reid, she said, has morphed the U.S. Senate from 'the world's greatest deliberative body' to a 'my way or the highway' institution.

'It matters so much for our country that we win this November,' she told a packed hotel ballroom in Nashua, N.H.

'Right now we're in a position where our allies feel abandoned ... and our enemies feel emboldened.'

The Obama administration has shied away from referring to any nation as America's 'enemy,' including Iran and Russia.

But Ayotte, along with other Senate Republicans including Kentuckian Rand Paul and Texan Ted Cruz, haven't been as reticent.

A successful U.S. foreign policy, Ayotte said Friday, would mean America's 'enemies understand that you don't mess with the United States of America.'

'Unfortunately I don't think that's the message they're getting right now, and it's making us less safe,' she said.

She joined former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore in saying that Mitt Romney, the Republicans' unsuccessful 2012 presidential candidate, had a most clear-headed outlook on Russia than President Obama.

Democrats mocked Romney during the campaign when he referred to Russia as America's top geopolitical foe.

'Let's face it ladies and gentlemen: Mitt was right,' said Ayotte, who was once on Romney's short list to be his vice presidential running mate.

Laughable: Sen. Ayotte took particular aim at Hillary Clinton and the 'reset' button she infamously gave Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in 2009

The gimmick was supposed to symbolize the intention to 'reset' relations between the U.S. and Russia

Oops: Instead of reading 'perezagruzka' - the Russian word for 'reset' - a stick-on label used the word 'peregruzka' was used, which actually meant 'overcharged'

She reserved special scorn for Hillary Clinton, the former first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state who figured to be the Democratic Party's chosen successor to Obama.

'To this day, no one has been held accountable' for the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi, Libya, Ayotte said.

And riffing on Clinton's one-time claim that it made little difference whether the attack was a premeditated terror strike or a protest that spun out of control, she declared: 'I want to say to Hillary Clinton that this does matter.'

Ayotte also jabbed Clinton for her 2009 appearance with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Geneva, where she famously presented her counterpart with a 'reset button.'

'We want to reset our relationship, and so we will do it together,' she said then.

The prop, meant to signify a new era in U.S.-Russia relations, now seems wishful to some in Washington, including Ayotte.

And the message itself was misspelled. Instead of reading 'perezagruzka,' the Russian word for 'reset,' a stick-on label used the word 'peregruzka,' which means 'overcharged.'

'Lest anyone forget, it was Clinton who pushed reset button with Russia,' Ayotte said Friday.

'I'm looking forward to seeing that in campaign commercials.'
