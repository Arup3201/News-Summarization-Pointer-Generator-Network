Dean of Windsor praised the two royals, who died 10 years ago, for 'enriching' the lives of family and friends

Event turned into more of a 
celebration when Princess Anne announced 
that Peter Phillips and wife Autumn had delivered a baby girl

Princess Beatrice won a whole host of new admirers today after inadvertently revealing that she had joined the nation - indeed the globe - in their shared love of Spanx.

Beatrice, who looked stunning in a floral Paul Smith dress and Sarah Davis hat, attended St George's chapel in Windsor with her family today for the memorial service of the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret.

But thanks to the combination of a longer-than-usual stride and a high split in the back of her skirt, Princess Beatrice managed to expose her light Spanx-type support tights.

The tights, which have a reinforced area at the top like tightly-fitting shorts, are worn by countless women the world over - even those as slender as Beatrice - to smooth out lumps and bumps and to avoid the dreaded VPL (visible panty line).

and to prevent VPL

Good company: Beyonce, Katie Holmes, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kim Kardashian have all flashed their Spanx too

Part of a range of shapewear available that comes as plain shorts, as tights, or as leggings, they are usually kept well under wraps.

Indeed, we would have been none the wiser that Beatrice was also a fan if events hadn't conspired in such a way as to reveal her secret support.

Beatrice is, of course, the latest in a long line of well-known - and less well-known - ladies to be spotted in the popular shapewear. 

Stars of all shapes and sizes admit to 
wearing the figure-fixing tights, or their shortie counterparts, and Katie Holmes, Beyonce and Sarah Jessica Parker have all flashed theirs.

Model Molly Sims said her Spanx helped her contain her 
pregnancy curves; The Help actress Octavia Spencer admitted to wearing 
three pairs to a recent awards ceremony.

held for the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret this morning

The truth is, Beatrice is in good company. Pulling on a pair of Spanx is now second nature to countless women, and testament to that is the fact that the company reported earlier this month that it was now worth around $1bn (£625m).

Its founder, Sara Blakely, appeared on the most recent cover of Forbes' Billionaires issue and, at 41, is the youngest self-made woman to make it onto Forbes' Billionaires list.

Elsewhere on the day, the other royals dressed in their best for the occasion, which was meant 
for joyous remembrance, not sadness, as members of the Royal 
Family recalled the remarkable lives of the late Queen Mother and her 
daughter, Princess Margaret.

A
 service at Windsor Castle, organised by the Queen, saw glowing tributes
 paid to the royal women, who died within weeks of each other ten years 
ago.

The event turned into 
even more of a celebration as the royal family gathered, when Princess 
Anne announced that her son, Peter Phillips, and his wife, Autumn, had 
just been safely delivered of a baby girl.

Royal
 family: Princess Beatrice, Timothy Laurence, Sophie, Countess of 
Wessex, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Andrew, Duke of York, 
Princess Eugenie, Prince Harry, Prince Charles, Prince of Wales and 
Princess Anne attended the ceremony for the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret this morning

Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall looked elegant in 
blue and cream coat with a matching broad-brimmed hat, while Princess 
Beatrice chose a silk floral pencil skirt and cropped blue jacket with a discreet cream Sarah Davis fascinator

The Queen wore a pale lavender suit with 
flower-trimmed hat, while Princess Eugenie wore a red printed dress and navy coat and hat

Statement: The Countess of Wessex wore a dramatic cream creation trimmed with black feathers

The couple chose the name Isla in 
honour of the family’s links to Scotland and ‘because they liked it’, 
while Elizabeth was, clearly a tribute to Peter’s grandmother.

Isla is now 13th in line to the throne
 as her mother renounced her Catholic faith shortly before she married 
and Buckingham Palace said yesterday that everyone was ‘delighted’ by 
her arrival.

Almost every senior member of the 
Royal Family turned up for yesterday’s service, the most notable 
exception being the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge who were, remarkably, 
given permission to go skiing.

Potential Olympics horsewoman Zara 
Phillips is understood to have been training while Prince Edward was 
absent as he is on an official visit to France.

In advance of the Queen and her 
husband, Prince Philip, who arrived by car just in time for the 11am 
service, the rest of the family made their way down to St George’s 
Chapel from the castle on foot, laughing and smiling in the unseasonably
 warm sunshine.

Princess Beatrice, eldest daughter of 
the Duke of York, was the most stylish among them in a form-fitting 
floral dress by Paul Smith, cropped navy jacket and jaunty Sarah Davis fascinator with LK Bennett 
shoes.

Beatrice, who has lost almost two 
stones in weight, has been keeping her figure trim with regular personal
 training sessions and tomorrow is due to start and take part in the 
National Lottery Olympic Park Run, which will see 5,000 members of the 
public become the first people to cross the Olympic finish line.

She was accompanied by her sister, 
Princess Eugenie, who has also noticeably lost weight of late and looked
 equally smart in a patterned Marc Jacobs dress and navy Austique coat.

The Queen has become a great-grandmother for the second time, Buckingham Palace said today.

Isla Phillips was born yesterday at
 Gloucestershire Royal Hospital, Gloucester, to Peter Phillips and wife 
Autumn, weighing 7lb 4oz. Perhaps in a nod to her great-grandmother’s 
Diamond Jubilee year, she has been given the middle name Elizabeth.

She is a second daughter for Mr 
Phillips, who was present at the birth, and his wife. Her older sister 
Savannah was born in 2010.

The Queen’s press secretary said: 
'The Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Princess Royal, Captain Mark 
Phillips and Autumn’s family have been informed and are delighted with 
the news.

'Isla Elizabeth is the second child
 for Peter and Autumn, the second grandchild for the Princess Royal and 
the second great-grandchild for the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh.

'She will be 13th in line to the throne.'

Buckingham Palace would not confirm if the middle name had specifically been chosen as a tribute to the Queen.

Congratulations: Autumn Phillips has become a mother for the second time. Isla Elizabeth is the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh's 's second great-grandchild

The Countess of Wessex wore one of her trademark striking hats, set at an acute angle and featuring a froth of black feathers.

The eye-catching headgear certainly 
caught the eye of her nephew, Prince Harry, who appeared unsure which 
cheek to kiss her on, prompting the pair to burst into giggles.

Also among the group were the Prince 
of Wales – who was exceptionally close to his grandmother - his wife, 
the Duchess of Cornwall, wearing a blue and white Bruce Oldfield dress 
and coat with a Philip Treacy hat, and Princess Anne and her husband, 
Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence.

A
 smiling Harry was followed into the chapel by his cousin, Princess 
Eugenie, who wore a printed Marc Jacobs dress and navy coat by Austique 
and hat by Marzi

Tribute: Princess Margaret and Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother were 
praised at a memorial service today for 'enriching' the lives of their 
family and friends

Inside the chapel, where the remains 
of the Queen Mother and Margaret are both interred, the Dean of Windsor,
 the Right Reverend David Conner, said that both women had 
‘significantly enriched’ the lives of those present.

‘Each of us here this morning will 
cherish some special personal memories; memories that awaken once again 
sentiments of affection and respect,’ he said.

Among the congregation at the private 
service were playwright Sir Tom Stoppard and actress Felicity Kendal, 
friends of Margaret who both attended her memorial service in 2002.

Also present was the Queen Mother's 
official biographer William Shawcross and horse trainer Nicky Henderson,
 a friend of the Queen and her mother.

Margaret’s son, Viscount Linley, who 
was accompanied by his wife, Serena, and sister, Lady Sarah Chatto, and 
their children, gave a reading, a religious piece by the former Dean of 
Westminster, Eric Abbott - titled The Compassion of God and the Passion 
of Christ - part of which was read at his mother's funeral.

Hymns sung included O God, Our Help In Ages Past, Angel Voices Ever Singing, and Now Thank We All Our God.

The Queen Mother died peacefully in 
her sleep 10 years ago to the day - March 30 2002 - aged 101, while her 
daughter died the previous month aged 71, after suffering the third in a
 series of strokes.

The period was a momentous one for the
 Queen who was celebrating 50 years on the throne as well as mourning 
the passing of her beloved mother and younger sister.

At the end of yesterday’s service the 
Queen, Philip and senior members of the royal family were privately 
taken to the King George VI memorial chapel where the remains of the 
King, his wife and their daughter are interred.

Beatrice attracted endless attention for her 
unusual fascinator at the royal wedding last year - not all of it good -
 and has since opted for much more subtle headgear
