A retired NYPD officer is being hailed a hero after he routed his failing helicopter to a cornfield instead of a busy shopping mall as it fell.

Michael Scarfia, 65, of Staten Island, was identified by 
West Windsor police as the pilot of the Aerospatiale AS355 twin-engine 
helicopter that went down shortly after noon in West Windsor.

West Windsor Lt. Robert Garofalo said in a news release Saturday night: ‘Scarfia dedicated his life to the city of New York as a police officer, and by diverting his failing helicopter into the cornfield and away from the crowded shopping malls, he again showed his bravery and dedication to others.’

'Eyewitnesses said they saw pieces of (the helicopter) coming apart, including the main rotor of the helicopter itself,' Garofalo said during an earlier news conference held near the crash scene.

Several witnesses also reported hearing grinding noises and possible explosions shortly before the helicopter went down in the field near Route 1 and Quakerbridge Road in the Mercer County community.

Authorities said the pilot did not report any trouble or make any emergency transmissions.

It was not immediately clear where the helicopter was headed or where it had departed from.

Besides West Windsor police, the Federal Aviation Administration and New Jersey state police were also investigating the accident.
