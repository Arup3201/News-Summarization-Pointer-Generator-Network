Online hit: Demi Barnes's wedding dress made from more than 1,500 divorce papers has gone viral after she posted a picture of it on Facebook

Demi, a student at Lingfield Notre Dame School in Surrey, designed the dress to represent the notion that too many people rush into getting married and end up getting divorced

The stunning gown, reminiscent of the Emanuelle gown worn by Princess Diana or one of Thelma Madine's elaborate designs as seen on Channel 4 show My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding, was made using more than 1,500 genuine divorce papers.

Demi, a student at Lingfield Notre Dame School in Surrey, designed the dress to represent the notion that too many people rush into getting married and end up getting divorced.

She said: 'When I put it up on Facebook, it was just to show my cousin in Italy what I’d been up to. 

'Within a week, it had had over 40,000 hits and people were approaching me to design their wedding dresses.

'Major designers have asked for copies.

'I’m passionate about fashion and design and am hoping someone will approach me with a work experience placement so I can turn my passion into a career.''

Head of Art at Demi's school, Claire Davis added: 'Demi became charged, like electricity, when she had the idea for the dress.

'This was an incredibly ambitious piece and it took courage, patience and tenacity to see this through from concept to final piece.'

Demi was originally going to make the dress out of magazines but decided upon a more interesting concept and put it together using a wire bodice frame and stapled divorce papers onto it.

Lingfield Notre Dame headmaster Richard Bool said that her design is the talk of her class.

He said: 'I’m extremely proud of the work Demi and the entire Art Department have achieved this academic year. 

'It is also a pleasure to see the power of social media working for a student in a positive and responsible way.'
