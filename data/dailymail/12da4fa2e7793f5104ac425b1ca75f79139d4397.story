Murder convict John Massey, who escaped from Pentonville Prison on Wednesday, was arrested today in Faversham, Kent

One of Britain’s longest serving murderers, who escaped from Pentonville prison in north London two days ago, has been arrested in Kent, police said.

John Massey, 64, was captured at an address in Faversham this afternoon following an 'intelligence-led operation', according to the Metropolitan Police.

Massey, who had broken out of jail twice before, accomplished his most
dramatic escape using a makeshift rope to scale the walls of the 
Victorian-built prison.

Both of Massey’s previous escapes were
to see ailing family members and this time he acted after his ill 86-year-old mother appealed to see him.

Friends of his family said he had 
learned only a few days ago that his mother May, who has Alzheimer’s 
disease, had been calling out his name at a care home in Kent.

Yesterday armed police kept 
watch on the home as a huge manhunt continued to search for the 
‘potentially  dangerous’ killer.

The escape on Wednesday is a huge 
embarrassment for the authorities, not least because it is the third 
time Massey has slipped from their grasp.

A friend of his mother 
said: ‘May is getting very old now, she is in her eighties, and she has a
touch of Alzheimer’s. She has been crying lately and asking for John.’

Massey was sentenced to life in 1976 
for shooting bouncer Charlie Higgins, 36, with a sawn-off shotgun after 
being thrown out of an East London pub for fighting.

He was also 
convicted of attempting to shoot a policeman dead after being chased in 
his Aston Martin getaway car.

An Old Bailey judge jailed the 
carpenter for a minimum of 20 years but he has become one of the 
country’s longest serving prisoners because of his repeated escapes.

Daring: Massey climbed over a wall at Pentonville Prison using a makeshift rope

Pentonville Prison has held some notorious inmates down the years.

The jail houses Category B and C prisoners - and not the most serious Category A cases.

Oscar Wilde spent time inside Pentonville before being transferred to Wandsworth in the late 19th century.

More recently, Pete Doherty spent six weeks inside for possessing cocaine last year, while Boy George and George Michael have also been held there.

In 2008, Blake Fielder-Civil, Amy Winehouse's then husband, was jailed at Pentonville for causing grievous bodily harm.

The prison, in Islington, north London, holds up to 1,250 inmates and has been used since 1842.

Convicted arsonist Julien Chautard escaped from Pentonville by clinging to the underside of the security van he arrived in three years ago.

His latest break-out took place at 
category B Pentonville Prison, in Islington, and appeared 
to have been carefully planned.

Massey is suspected of hiding in the 
roof of the gym building as other inmates returned to their cells on 
Wednesday afternoon.

He then used a makeshift rope – 
believed to have been strung together out of sheets – and a pair of 
heavy  duty gloves to scale the high  prison wall.

Guards monitoring CCTV cameras saw the
rope and raced to the perimeter wall at about 6.30pm but were too late.
They suspect he was assisted by someone outside.

A source said: ‘The guy went to the gym and then hid in the roof and  just waited and then escaped from there.’ 

Prison staff have been banned from 
speaking about the escape, but one added: ‘He’s done this before, he’ll 
be back.’

Massey’s first escape was in 1994 during a home visit when he 
calmly walked out of a social club while his guards played pool and 
drank.

He fled to the Costa Del Sol and spent three years on the run before being caught and returned to  a Britain.

In 2007 he was released on parole but 
was told he must live in South London and could not stay with his 
family. But he broke the conditions by travelling to stay with his 
father, Jack, 82, who was dying at the Royal Free Hospital, in North 
London.

Afterwards, Massey said: ‘My dad had 
travelled the length and breadth of this country a thousand times in 30 
years in order to visit me in various god-forsaken and dingy prisons.

‘I could not fail him or my mother. To do so would have buckled my shoulders with guilt of unspeakable things to come.’

Two years ago he absconded from Ford 
open prison in West Sussex after being refused permission to visit his 
terminally ill sister Carol, who was in the same hospital where his 
father died.

She died two weeks later but rather than hand himself in Massey went to live with his mother and was not caught for ten months.

Last night, the sister of Massey’s victim said she was disgusted at his escape.

Mother-of-three Carol Spooner, 64, of 
Braintree, Essex, said: ‘I was stunned to hear it was the third time he 
had escaped. It is disgraceful.

‘As far as I am concerned, a life 
sentence should mean just that. 

'He should die behind bars. ‘I was very 
close to my brother and went to each day at court during the trial. I 
can still remember the jeers of  his family, saying “At least ours is 
still alive”.’

Pentonville was described by prison inspectors as one of Britain's most 
challenging jails to run last year, but the inspection also found 'no 
obvious problems with physical security'.

In 2009 a convicted arsonist escaped from Pentonville by clinging to the underside of a security van.

Julien
Chautard was sentenced to seven years in jail at Snaresbrook Crown 
Court in February 2009, but spent just minutes inside Pentonville before
slipping out underneath the van he had arrived in.
