Disney characters are known as fun-loving and cuddly sorts – but a Spanish man discovered that they are capable of violence if provoked.

A heckler in a Madrid square pushed two street performers dressed as Mickey and Minnie Mouse over the edge and got a bloodied nose as a result.

A brawl between the three erupted when entertainers Fazzio and Ticiana Yanez lost their temper at the critic, who they said 'just wouldn't leave us alone'.

The punch-up – filmed by passers-by – shows Fazzio ripping off his Mickey Mouse head and then grappling with the heckler, getting him in a headlock.

His partner then takes off her Minnie head too as she follows the tussle around the square shouting abuse and grabbing at the man's clothing.

Passer-by Aristobulo Olivarez said: 'It's certainly not something you see every day.'

He added: 'He'd been heckling their balloon bending magic act for some time and it seems they'd had enough.'

Police halted the brawl by separating the heckler - later identified as Vero Arreola - and Fazzio, who by now had a bloody nose.

Minnie performer Ticiana said: 'We have a good children's show but he just wouldn't leave us alone.'

Police spokesman Seneca Nino said: 'Three people have been interviewed over a public disturbance.'

According to local media the incident, which was widely shared on social media in Spain, could also have unfortunate consequences for the pair after local Disney representatives said they were not licensed, and officials are compelled to take action to ban them from using the cartoon characters in future. 

It follows footage emerging of a Russian driver being left dazed and confused after he was attacked by a group dressed as cartoon characters including Mickey Mouse and Spongebob SquarePants in a bizarre road rage incident.

Footage of the incident, which shows the driver as he stops his vehicle in front of a minibus in the middle of the road, became an internet hit.

The unverified footage, filmed on another vehicle's dashboard camera, apparently shows the driver as he gets out of his vehicle and appears to remonstrate with the driver of the minibus. 

Before long however he finds himself outnumbered as four people dressed as cartoon characters, including Scrat from Ice Age and a Russian character called Luntik, sneak around the side of the minibus before confronting him.

The group then appears to proceed to get the better of the driver as they force him to the ground and begin kicking and punching him.

Following the attack, which lasts for about 15 seconds, the group appear to get back into the van before it drives off.
