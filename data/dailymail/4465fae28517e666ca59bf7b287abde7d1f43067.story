The monies brought through the doors at Stamford Bridge and Anfield over the summer were notably similar; so too the cash spent on new signings. What's killed off any hope of Liverpool challenging for the title is the difference in quality of those incoming.

It doesn't make pretty reading for Liverpool supporters, who felt they were on their way to a first Premier League crown when this pair last met in April. It had looked for all the world they'd seal it, but that came tumbling down with Demba Ba's strike and Jose Mourinho's merry dance.

Since then the Reds have gone backwards - and markedly so.

Liverpool recouped over £60million in a deal that saw Luis Suarez sign for Barcelona in the summer

Rickie Lambert (£4m) 

Afforded a wealth of money to revamp their entire squad after the sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona, Brendan Rodgers has so far failed miserably. 

The spine of Southampton's impressive side to have finished eighth last season was picked apart by the Northern Irishman. Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana and Dejan Lovren all penned deals. Fine, you'd think, if this was a team to have ended the previous campaign seventh and needed to kick on. 

Unfortunately for Liverpool, these signings came a year too late. Certainly not those of a side who had designs of the title. These mistakes cost them a pretty penny, too.

Lallana is yet to impact a game from midfield, Lambert is used as a substitute only and Lovren just doesn't have the positional awareness of a top central defender.  

Brendan Rodgers doesn't seem to have made the most of his summer spending money

Whether Rodgers is now questioning the wisdom of splashing around £50million on a trio of players with absolutely no experience of challenging for titles and just one with previous in the Champions League is unknown. But you'd have to imagine he's at least pondered whether  the biggest opportunity of his managerial career has been squandered in a flurry of giddy excitement with chequebook in hand.

The most galling aspect of their struggles since August is that the war chest was mismanaged to such an extent that Chelsea have shown them up horribly.

They too recouped around £75m thanks to the sales of David Luiz to Paris St Germain and Romelu Lukaku to Everton, but spent it wisely. See Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas - arguably the best players in the division.

Perhaps Rodgers' perception of his club isn't aligned with what they achieved last year. Why, with the millions at their disposal, did he not try and land players to have a real impact on the Premier League and Europe?

At one stage, Loic Remy looked set to sign for Liverpool, but ended up sealing a deal to Stamford Bridge

Whether Costa would have fancied the north-west over London is debatable, but Liverpool needed to do more than roll a £16m dice on Mario Balotelli.

By contrast, the Blues secured their top targets and added Filipe Luis from Atletico Madrid as well. 

Loic Remy - whose move to Liverpool collapsed after a medical - was allowed to join the league leaders. Used largely as a substitute, the Frenchman could have offered so much more from the start for Rodgers. 

The individual prices paid for Costa and Fabregas are higher than splashed by Liverpool, proving it's more efficient to spend extra money on one player and sign fewer than to accumulate numbers who aren't going to have an impact.
