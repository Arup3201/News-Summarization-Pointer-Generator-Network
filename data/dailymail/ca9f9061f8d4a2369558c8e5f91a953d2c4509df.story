And then there were two. For Steven Gerrard, that is. If the Liverpool captain is to mark his long goodbye with a trophy it will have to be in the FA Cup or the Europa League.

Chelsea move on to Wembley in the Capital One Cup final and their supporters did not miss the chance to remind him that another chance had passed him by.

Gerrard did not linger on the pitch at Stamford Bridge. He applauded the away fans in the Shed End and disappeared down the tunnel, leaving the home team to savour their victory.

Over the two legs, Liverpool could be satisfied with their performance. While clearly lacking a finisher - a potent threat in front of goal to give purpose to their pleasing approach play - they pushed Chelsea into extra-time which in itself amounts to a sign of recovery after a dreadful few months.

Brendan Rodgers has hauled this team up from their knees, from the November low in the capital when they were beaten at Crystal Palace, a fourth successive defeat.

That day at Selhurst Park, a dejected Liverpool boss confessed his job was not safe, but he and his team have responded, even if they were not able to stop the slide out of the Champions League.

This was only their second defeat in 17 since Palace. More importantly, Rodgers has seen his team recapture some of the zest and intensity which was a trademark of last season.

Over two legs, they have genuinely troubled Chelsea, the team which won at Anfield in April and sparked their collapse in the title race.

Rodgers has tweaked his formation, finally realising that the system designed to get the most from Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge was of limited use with Suarez in Barcelona and Sturridge injured.

The tempo is up, thanks in part to the energy of Raheem Sterling who appears refreshed after his Caribbean break.

Perhaps Gerrard’s decision to confirm his plans to leave for Los Angeles at the end of the season has done everyone a favour, too.

The talisman is on his way and it is time for others to stand up and seize the chance to succeed him as the team’s spiritual leader.

Philippe Coutinho (centre) caused Chelsea plenty of problems over the two legs of the semi-final 

At the same time, Rodgers has been able to use him more sparingly, give him the rest he needs and squeeze more from him in the most important fixtures, like this one.

Gerrard was influential at Stamford Bridge, especially in the first-half, when Liverpool were at their most fluent in attack caused Chelsea problems.

His passing brought the wing-backs into the game and took advantage of the holes appearing in Chelsea’s defensive unit.

Jose Mourinho, for all his defensive acumen and attention to detail, has not found it easy to quash the threats of Sterling and Philippe Coutinho over the two legs of this semi-final.

Were it not for Thibaut Courtois, who made first-half saves which bought Chelsea the time to adjust and fight their way back into the game last night, it might have been different.

Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli (centre) entered the fray with 20 minutes but once again proved ineffective 

Moreover, if Liverpool had a striker it might have been different.

They might have won this second leg by half-time with a deadly finisher in the team like, for example, Suarez. Or even with Sturridge, who is still not quite fit, which seems to have been his operational status for quite a while.

Mario Balotelli was again not the answer. Coming off the bench with 20 minutes of normal time remaining, he was unable to contribute anything useful, smashing one sharp chance high into the Matthew Harding Stand and curling an ambitious effort over from a tight angle when he would have been better off passing the ball.

Sterling, despite scoring the goal in the first leg, does not yet have the composure to offer a reliable source of goals – and there was to be no heroic rescue act from Gerrard.

Perhaps he will save that for one of the other competitions.
