She's one of world's most famous supermodels and it's one of the high street's most iconic shops, so news of Kate Moss designing once more for Topshop had fashion fans in a flurry.

While no date has been set for its release, Kate has been teasing fans with a few glimpses of her highly-anticipated new collection.

Today, she was unveiled wearing one of her own outfits on the cover of Vogue's May edition and now Kate has taken us behind the scenes at Topshop to showcase some of her upcoming designs and the inspiration behind them.

Grand reveal: Kate Moss, who last designed for Topshop in 2007, is the star of a new video giving a sneak peek of her upcoming range

Speaking in a video, the famously elusive Kate says: 'The first collection was seven years ago so I've grown up a lot and I learned a lot the first time around.

'This collection is a bit more sophisticated, everything in the collection is something that I would definitely wear and I can't wait to get my hands on it.'

Quick glimpse: The video swiftly flashes to a rail packed with Kate's upcoming designs, which look perfect for festival season

What I wear: Kate explains that all the clothes are things she would wear herself and she can't wait to showcase them

As Kate shares her thoughts on the new range, the camera pans in on her mood board, which features snaps of the model over the years.

Kate revealed that the tasselled waistcoat she is wearing on her Vogue cover was actually inspired by one she owned but lost.

Inside the glossy fashion bible, 
for her second shoot as contributing fashion editor, Kate also styled 
model Freja Beha Erichsen.

Mood board: Clearly Kate has been putting a lot of effort into her designs and has even taken inspiration from her favourite outfits, as well as her style icons

Freja wears a
leather waistcoat, chiffon top and shorts - all Kate's own designs for 
Topshop - along with a leather corset from Jitrois.

The
Croydon-born model last worked with the high street brand between 
2007-2010 and her new collection will be sold in 40 
countries this year.

While the store are yet to reveal a definite release date, the landing page on their site reads: 'Supermodel, style icon and long-time Topshop friend, Kate Moss is back!

'The
 fashion icon is returning to Topshop after a three-year hiatus and has 
been working with stylist Katy England and Topshop creative director 
Kate Phelan on a collection that's due to launch in May 2014.

'If you
 fell in love with her floral tea dresses or her denim cut-offs from 
Kate Moss' seasons past, we have no doubt you'll fall for what's coming 
next.'

Coming soon: While the store are yet to reveal a release date, the landing page on their site reads: 'Supermodel, style icon and long-time Topshop friend, Kate Moss is back!'

Grown up style: Kate, modelling her collection in 2009, says she learned so much from the process and has grown up a lot since then
