The next issue of Charlie Hebdo will be published on February 25 and weekly thereafter, editors have announced.

The new issue will be the first in six weeks after the surviving staff went to print on January 14 - exactly one week after the massacre when 12 people were murdered.

A statement from the editors on the Charlie Hebdo website reads: 'The editorial staff of Charlie Hebdo invite you back on Wednesday February 25th 2015, publication date for our next issue, and thereafter at our normal weekly rhythm.'

Confirmed: Editors revealed the next edition of Charlie Hebdo will be published for the first time in six weeks on February 25

Massacre: On Wednesday January 7, Said and Cherif Kouachi stormed the magazine's offices and murdered 12 people, including staff and police officers

The current issue of the magazine, which controversially featured an image of the Prophet Mohammed on the cover, will be available from newsagents until March 10. 

On Wednesday January 7, Said and Cherif Kouachi stormed the magazine's offices and murdered 12 people, including staff and police officers.

Charlie Hebdo editor Stephane Charbonnier, 47, died alongside Jean Cabut, 76, Elsa Cayat, 54, Philippe Honoré, 74, Bernard Maris, 68, Mustapha Ourrad, 60, Michel Renaud, 69, Bernard Verlhac, 57, and Georges Wolinski, 80.

The following day, Amedy Coulibaly murdered a female police officer before shooting dead four hostages at a kosher delicatessen in Eastern Paris.

In the weeks that  followed, the world showed its support for the people of Paris and defiant Charlie Hebdo staff released a survivors' edition seven days on from the attack. 

Twelve people were killed when gunmen  stormed the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo in Paris on January 7

The Paris massacre led to an outpouring of support around the world, including the 'Je Suis Charlie' message

Issues of the magazine, of which about seven million copies were printed, sold out across Paris news kiosks within minutes. 

At the end of January, bosses vowed the satirical magazine would be published in the near future, but said staff are emotionally exhausted and still recovering after the massacre that killed their friends. 

In recent days, police forces in the UK have been caught asking newsagents which have sold copies of the satirical magazine for details of customers have bought it. 

The move has been branded 'entirely unacceptable' by privacy campaigners.
