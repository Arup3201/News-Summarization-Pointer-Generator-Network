This is the moment a fugitive DUI killer prepared to face justice - by topping up her lip gloss.

Kelly Lynn Miller, 36, admitted drunkenly smashing her car into a truck being driven by Donald Goodwin, 57, killing him instantly - but dodged her prison sentence by fleeing to Thailand.

She had pleaded guilty to a charge on vehicular homicide following the 2004 crash in Hoover, Alabama - but flew to the tropical country while on bail, and had been hiding there until Thai authorities tracked her down.

Miller was hauled in front of the media by police in Phuket this week.  But rather than showing contrition in front of the cameras, she took a moment to put her make-up in order.

Local outlet Phuket News pictured her looking nonchalant and resting her head on her hands at the event.

According to members of the grief-stricken Goodwin family, the apparent lack of concern for her crime is typical of Miller. 

The victim's sister, Faye Dees, told Daily Mail Online that she 'didn't seem too concerned' for her slain brother - even moments after she killed him.

During her trial, Dees said, she continued to act as if 'she didn't understand what the big deal was', even when family members confronted her directly.

Miller was busted after years of island-hopping in remote parts of Thailand, where she traveled around on an expired visa.

Extradition: Miller is due to be brought back to the United States to face justice, after she appears in Thai court on charges of living in the country illegally

Although she entered the country legally, Miller should have returned to the U.S. to start her jail sentence.

During her illicit stay, she even gave birth to a son, whose father is thought to be an American living in Thailand legally. It is not clear whether he knew about Miller's conviction.

She is expected to appear in a Thai court for staying in the country without proper documents - and is then likely to be deported to face U.S. justice.

A spokesman for the Thai Tourist Police said: 'She flew to Thailand legally after she was granted bail in her car smash case.

'A few months after she disappeared, the U.S. canceled her passport but she had already thrown it away, and had been moving around Thailand a lot.'

The authority vowed to tighten its procedures to stop people using Thailand as a bolthole from justice in future.

Authorities say they were tipped off last month about Miller, who was officially declared a fugitive in 2010. She is thought to have been surviving on money wired to her by family.

According to AL.com, Goodwin was killed shortly after pulling over had pulled over onto an emergency lane of the highway to check the tires on his tractor-trailer.

Miller side-swiped the vehicle moments later in the fatal collision, which took place not long after midnight.

She was arrested  on DUI charges but released the next day after posting $1,000 bond.

In 2006, a Jefferson County jury indicted Miller on a charge of vehicular homicide. She was re-arrested but again freed from jail after posting $10,000 bond.

Miller was expected to go on trial in January 2007 but pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five years in prison - but never showed up for her sentence.

Family members said that, had Goodwin lived, he would have retired in 2009 and planned to work on a small piece of land he had bought.
