Slow motion film experts have filmed themselves firing guns underwater for the first time to show the mini tornadoes and unusual shapes created by the weapons.

Gavin and Dan, who are known on YouTube as The Slo Mo Guys, made a video to show the differing effects that two guns created in a freezing swimming pool.

After being triggered, a tornado forms at the end of both guns for a few short seconds before the bullets sink down to the bottom of the pool and surrounding bubbles float to the surface.

Scroll down for video...

Gavin and Dan -The Slo Mo Guys - used a Phantom V1610 high-speed camera to film the effect of firing a revolver underwater

At 27,450 frames per second, the standard-definition footage played back at 30fps about 1,000 times slower than in real life

The duo describe high-speed cameras as 'microscopes for time'

The Slo Mo Guys fired two different types of handguns - a 9mm pistol and a revolver.

They recorded the effects with a specialist Phantom V1610 high-speed camera, which can make the action 1,000 times slower than real life.

The mesmerising footage was shot at 27,450 frames per second.

The bullets whiz through the water, leaving behind only trails of air pockets and gun powder.

The men said: 'It sounded awesome underwater - like a metallic sound.'

The revolver had more gas coming out when it was fired to produce more bubbles than the short-barreled pistol that can be seen in the video.

The duo said: 'Watching the bubbles appear and slowly dissipate is enough to bring you some much-needed midday zen.'

The pair spent approximately one hour in the swimming pool, which was just four degrees Celsius in temperature.

More than 3.5 million people have viewed the video on YouTube.

Firearms can be discharged underwater but bullets lose velocity rapidly and are rendered less lethal beyond a metre.

The entire gun has to be submerged in water, with all air pockets removed in order to prevent a possible explosion when firing.

The water pressure can cause used cartridge casings to fail to leave gun chambers after they were fired, which can make a gun only able to fire a single bullet.

This is not the first time that an underwater bullet video has proven a YouTube hit.

Firearms expert Andrew Tuohy filmed himself firing a range of weapons including a .40 Glock 22 in his swimming pool, last year.

However, he did not just fire the guns for fun like The Slo Mo Guys, but insted collected the bullets to make 'tactical flowers' for his mother.

The resistance of the water caused the bullet to expand in perfect formation, creating beautiful lead blossoms.
