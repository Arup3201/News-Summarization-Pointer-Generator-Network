The two-year hunt for the man who recovered millions of dollars worth of sunken treasure only to disappear after being sued by investors  is receiving renewed attention after a new expedition found the ship earlier this year.

Tommy Thompson was last seen by a maintenance worker, walking on the pool deck of his Florida mansion and wearing nothing more than eye glasses, leather shoes, socks and underwear.

Just over two decades earlier, Thompson appeared more like a conquering hero after he docked his ship in Norfolk, Virginia, weighed down with thousands of pounds of gold that had sat on the bottom of the ocean for 131 years. 

The gold remains of a wooden cargo box unearthed from the SS Central America are shown at a coin collection expo in Long Beach, California. The gold was unearthed  after treasure hunter Tommy Thompson found the ship in 1988

Hundreds cheered his achievement on that day in 1989, but it wasn't long before companies claiming they had originally insured the gold sued him claiming it was all theirs, according to the AP. And eventually the investors who poured $12.7 million into his expedition along with his crew were demanding their shares too. 

It soon became too much for Thompson, it seems, and he vanished without a trace two years ago after skipping a court date to explain to investors what had happened.

Since then the U.S. Marshals Service has hunted Thompson as a fugitive. 

'I think he had calculated it, whatever you want to call it, an escape plan,' Marshals agent Brad Fleming told the AP. 'I think he's had that for a long time.'

Thompson's adventure started in 1983 when he began to grow obsessed about tracking down the SS Central America, which carried 425 people and gold worth hundreds of millions millions of dollars when it was lost in a hurricane in 1857 off the coast of South Carolina. 

An oceanic engineer at Battelle Memorial Institute in Columbus, Thompson convinced 161 people to invest in his quest and eventually found his treasure on October 1, 1988. He later described it as 'otherworldly in its splendor'. 

Not long after, 39 companies claimed they had insured the gold back in 1857 and that it belonged to them, suing him for their right to the treasure, the AP reported.

This undated drawing made available by the Library of Congress shows the U.S. Mail ship SS Central America, which sank after sailing into a hurricane in September 1857 in one of the worst maritime disasters in American history; 425 people were killed and thousands of pounds of gold sank with it to the bottom of the ocean

In 1996, Thompson's company was awarded 92 per cent of the treasure, with the rest divided among some of the insurers. Four years later, Thompson's company made $50 million selling 532 gold bars and thousands of coins to a gold marketing group. 

But Thompson still hadn't paid his investors. Two of them - a now-deceased investment firm president who invested $250,000 and the Dispatch Printing Company, which put in about $1 million - sued in 2005. 

And the following year, nine members of Thompson's crew piled on their own lawsuit, claiming they were promised some of the proceeds. 

After that Thompson sank into seclusion and moved into a mansion in Vero Beach, Florida. He said he feared for his life.

He refused to use his real name on utility bills and told realtor Vance Brinkerhoff that he had been threatened, the AP reported. 

'How would you like to live like that?' Brinkerhoff recounted  Thompson asking him in a court deposition.

It isn't clear when precisely Thompson disappeared. On August 13, 2012, he failed to appear at the court hearing, and a federal judge ordered him found in contempt and issued an arrest warrant. 

James Kennedy, the maintenance worker who last saw Thompson, soon after that he went inside the mansion and found prepaid disposable cellphones and bank wraps for $10,000 bills, along with a book called 'How to Live Your Life Invisible'.

The Marshals Service, which splashed Thompson's face on billboards, ran down hundreds of potential leads, including one from a guy who thought he shared an elevator with him and another that suggested the treasure hunter signed his name on a memorial website for a dead friend.

Nothing panned out. 

Now a 'wanted' poster hangs inside a barge that repeated Thompson's voyage and has since Apirl been busily pulling millions of dollars in gold and silver bars and coins from the Central America, known as the 'Ship of Gold'.

Florida-based Odyssey Marine Exploration will continue the work indefinitely, and Thompson's original investors are expected to receive a share of the recovered riches, according to the AP. to Central America now in search of the 'Ship of Gold'.

There are many theories as to where Thompson, now 62, might be. 

Mike Szolosi, the crew members' attorney, argues that he has seen records indicating Thompson grabbed 500 gold coins worth $2 million and potentially millions more from his company, Columbus-America Discovery Group.  

'Presumably all of that is still somewhere with Tommy,' he said.

Attorney Rick Roble, who defended Thompson's company until he withdrew from the case last month, said there's no proof Thompson stole anything.

Author Gary Kinder, who chronicled the treasure hunt in 'Ship of Gold in the Deep Blue Sea,' said nothing in his time with Thompson gives him any insight into his whereabouts. 

'I don't know what it would entail to hide like that,' he said. 'Get your teeth fixed? Buy a blond wig?'

Agent Fleming believes Thompson is likely still in the U.S.

If caught, Thompson would be asked to account for the missing coins and explain where proceeds from the treasure's sale went. He could face jail time and hefty fines if he refuses.

Gil Kirk, a former director of one of Thompson's companies, said he put $1.8 million into the treasure hunt. Though he hasn't gotten any of that back, Kirk still supports Thompson and insists he never bilked anyone.

To Kirk, Thompson remains an American hero, 'like the Wright brothers.' The tragedy, he said, is that Thompson's dream became his doom.

'Tommy used the word, what's the word?' Kirk said. 'Plague of the gold.'

Thompson, right, talks with Bob Evans on the Arctic Discover in 1991. Thomson hasn't been seen in more than two years since he missed a court hearing and vanished
