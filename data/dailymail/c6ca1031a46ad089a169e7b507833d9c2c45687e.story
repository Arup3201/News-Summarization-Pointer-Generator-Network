When Nigel Evans was first tipped off that a young man had accused him of rape he appeared relaxed, never believing the claim would be taken seriously

Like so many gay men of a certain vintage, it was only after the death of his mother that Nigel Evans had the courage to come out. The loss of Betty Evans five years ago was a shattering experience for the Tory MP.

But even the grief he suffered then must pale in comparison with the distress he has endured since the Crown Prosecution Service decided to charge him with nine sex offences against seven men.

Evans remained relaxed when a close friend tipped him off last May that a young man of 22 had made rape allegations against him to the police. He never thought for a second it would be taken seriously.

Today Evans must know that, even though he’s been cleared by a jury, his reputation is in tatters.

The 56-year-old was portrayed in court as a sad, lonely, middle-aged man with a penchant for sex with men half his age.

His own assessment to his legal team was simply that ‘there’s no fool like an old fool’.

While his Conservative Association in Ribble Valley has been steadfastly loyal, some fellow Tory MPs fear he might not have the stomach to go on after the next election.

An intensely private man who hid his sexuality for decades, he has been humiliated by the graphic descriptions of his clumsy and often drunken attempts at seduction inside his small constituency cottage in Lancashire.

Though he was a popular choice to become the Deputy Speaker of the Commons four years ago, he had to resign from the job to clear his name. Even if his successor Eleanor Laing, another Tory      MP, wanted to resign to give  him his job back, it’s not in her  gift to do so. It is a matter for  the Commons.

He also faces potential financial ruin. The proceeds from the sale of the 80-year-old family greengrocer’s business, which were supposed to support his retirement, have gone on legal fees.

Given his Welsh roots, it is perhaps surprising that Evans became a rising star of the Tory Party. Born in Swansea, he went to the local state school.

As soon as his head could be seen above the counter, he began working in the greengrocer’s established by his grandfather in the 1930s. Evans likens it to the shop in the sitcom Open All Hours.

Like so many gay men of a certain vintage, it was only after the death of his mother Betty Evans (pictured in London in 2003) that Mr Evans summoned the courage to come out

Mr Evans launched the ParliOut group for gay MPs

As a teenager he knew he was  gay but hid it, later stepping out with a girlfriend for the benefit of his God-fearing parents Albert  and Betty.

At 17, he joined the Young Conservatives when Margaret Thatcher became Tory leader. ‘I always thought it was God’s little joke,’ he once said. ‘He made me born in Swansea and born a Tory.’ He also wryly commented: ‘It wasn’t so much “the only gay in the village” as “the only Tory in Swansea”.’

Evans went on to study politics at the city’s university, but remained troubled by his sexuality, agonising over whether to tell his mother once his father died of cancer.

‘There was just no right time. I just did not want to upset her. I didn’t know how she would take it,’ he recalled.

Having fought and lost in two  safe Labour seats in the 1980s, he was selected to fight a by-election in Ribble Valley in 1991.

Even though he lost, the local Tories stayed true to him and he won the seat in the general election the following year.

When he became an MP, he made a calculated decision to opt for a life of celibacy. He was ambitious and, in a Conservative Party hostile to the gay community, he decided that pretending to be heterosexual was the best way to advance his career.

He even voted in favour of a series of measures which were seen to be anti-gay, such as opposing an equal age of consent.

But by 2000, the pressures of living a lie became unbearable and he started to ‘consummate’ the gay phase of his life.

At the bar at Tory Party conferences, or in the Sport & Social Club in the Commons, he often drank too much surrounded by young male researchers and was known to have wandering hands.

He often used to sit hand-in-hand on the Commons terrace with one of the men who gave evidence against him in court. There  was inevitably gossip about  the amount of time he spent with male researchers often half  his age.

Speaker of the Commons John Bercow (left) called in police after claims were made by a second man. It was during Michael Howard's (right) reign as leader of the Tories that Mr Evans' shadow cabinet career came to an end. There was an insinuation during the court case he was sacked because of his conduct, it was untrue

After the election of Iain Duncan Smith as Tory leader in 2001, Evans was made shadow Welsh Secretary. He contrived to be absent from  the vote allowing civil partnerships, missed three votes on  gay adoption and in one vote opposed it.

In 2003, Evans’s shadow Cabinet career ended with the election of Michael Howard as Tory leader. There was an insinuation during the court case from the prosecution that he was sacked because of his social conduct. It wasn’t true.

Howard was shrinking the size of the shadow Cabinet, and the Wales portfolio was reduced in stature. Evans decided to return to the backbenches rather than carry on in a lesser role.

'I have never come across somebody who was so open and positive about their sexuality. I was impressed'

- Nigel Evans speaking about his attraction to one of his alleged victims

In the years that followed, he became more settled in his  sexuality. Ironically, it was a man who had helped Evans come to terms with being gay who, in 2009, told Tory whips that the MP had sexually assaulted him.

Evans readily admits he had wrongly assumed there was a mutual sexual attraction, but flatly  denies sexual assault, a claim the jury believed.

Speaking during the trial of the attraction he felt towards the young man, Evans told the court: ‘I have never come across somebody who was so open and positive about their sexuality. I was impressed.

‘We would sit very closely together. We would hold hands. My experiences were somewhat more limited than his.’

After the allegations were made to the whips in 2009, no official action was taken, and a year later Evans was elected Deputy Speaker by his fellow MPs.

By that point, his mother had  died and, having stopped his  late-night drinking sessions in Parliament, within months he had come out.

The three years that followed were some of the happiest of his life. But everything changed when further claims were made against him by a second man last year, and the Commons Speaker John Bercow called in the police.
