A woman with multiple sclerosis threw herself into a canal after begging her twin sister to help get her to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland so she could end her life, an inquest heard.

When her sister refused to pay for her flight to the Zurich clinic, Carol Hutchins rode in her wheelchair for two miles to throw herself in a canal.

The inquest was told that the 53-year-old had tried to throw herself into the same canal, in Reading, Berkshire, the day before her death.

However, a mechanism in her wheelchair had jammed, meaning she was unable to raise the seat high enough to pull herself over the fence and into the water.

The failed attempt had made her so distraught she returned home in tears, a coroner's court in Windsor, Berkshire, was told.

After fixing the faulty mechanism, Miss Hutchins returned to the Kennet and Avon Canal the following day and waited until workmen, who were cleaning graffiti nearby, went on a break before she tried again.

Despite not having the use of her body from the waist down, she had enough strength to pull herself up over the fence and into the canal.

When they returned, the workers found Miss Hutchins's body face down in the water and her empty wheelchair on the towpath.

A police officer jumped over the fence and dragged her body from the water but, despite efforts to revive her, she was pronounced dead shortly after arriving at hospital.

Her cause of death was drowning, a post-mortem examination confirmed.

Miss Hutchins was described as having a vibrant personality and being a keen marathon runner before her body was ravaged by the disease, the Berkshire coroner heard.

The condition was diagnosed in 1989 had slowly stripped away her health.

The Berkshire coroner heard that Carol
was diagnosed with MS in 1989 and had taken part in marathons before MS
ravaged her body and left her wheelchair bound.

Her sister, Ingrid Foan, said that in
July 2010 her depressed sister was unable to do anything for herself 
and begged her to buy a one way plane ticket to Switzerland so she could
end her life.

She told the hearing: 'She was terrified by what was happening to her.'

She told how her sister had said that 
she had 'lost everything and didn't want to live like this anymore,' and
had previously spoken of throwing herself into the canal.

Ms Foan explained that after a 10-week
hospital stay her sibling's condition had improved and she was able to 
do much more for herself.

Carol's devastated parents, Alec and 
Ursula, said they believed their daughter had planned to end her life 
before her condition worsened further and she could no longer control 
her destiny.

Mr Hutchins said: 'We think she planned it while she was in hospital.

'She didn't involve anyone else. She knew exactly what MS was and what it was doing to her.'

When asked whether they thought Carol had taken her own life, Mr Hutchins replied: 'I'm in no doubt.'

In recording his verdict coroner Peter Bedford said that Carol was suffering from a 'horrible' disease at the time of her death.

'From the evidence given to me I am 
quite satisfied that Carol Hutchins died on October 22 last year at the 
Royal Berkshire Hospital and that she took her own life while suffering 
from multiple sclerosis and depression.'

Speaking before the hearing Mr Hutchins called for assisted suicide to be legalised.

He said: 'Carol was a very courageous 
woman but at the end of the day she has demonstrated a need for 
euthanasia in this country.

'People say life is precious but there comes a point when life is not precious and it becomes torture for those that are living.

'Carol had thought about going to 
Dignitas in Switzerland but it is very expensive and it puts other 
people in a difficult position.

'It showed tremendous courage for her 
to do what she did all alone and I believe that she had planned it after
having enough of being a prisoner in her own home.

'She knew one more setback could leave
her totally immobilised and she wouldn't be able to do anything for 
herself and she would just be washed, dressed and stuck in front of the 
television.'
