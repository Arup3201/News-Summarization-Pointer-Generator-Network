Newcastle United have completed the signing of Monaco striker Emmanuel Riviere for a fee in the region of £6million.

The 24-year-old put the finishing touches to his move at the Magpies’ North Tyneside training base on Wednesday.

But despite being Monaco's top marksman last term, very little is known of Riviere.

Well then, who is he?

Riviere is a 24-year-old striker – born on the French-ruled Caribbean island of Martinique - who has played for France at every level up to and including under-21, where he scored six times from 15 appearances.

What is his club record like?

Since moving to Monaco in January of last year for a fee of around £3.5m, he has proved a one-in-three striker, returning 17 goals from 50 outings. He helped the cash-rich club to promotion in his first season but was in and out of the side last time around. His record before moving to the principality wasn’t quite as impressive goals wise; 19 from 85 for first club Saint-Etienne and 10 from 47 for Toulouse.

How did he do last season?

Well, he was Monaco’s top scorer in Ligue 1 with 10 goals – he bagged six in six at the start of the campaign - as they finished second to PSG. To take that prize he beat off competition from World Cup Golden Boot winner James Rodriguez and his Colombian compatriot Radamel Falcao, both of whom scored nine. Falcao, in fairness, missed the second half of the season with a knee-ligament injury but Riviere still netted his 10 from just 19 starts.

Price tag: The striker cost United in the region of £6m

What sort of player are Newcastle getting?

The first thing to mention is his blistering pace and a lot of Riviere’s goals have seen him spring clear of the last defender. He is a physical type and can mix it with his minders as well as leaving them in his wake. He has likened himself to Thierry Henry, so clearly doesn’t want for confidence and self-belief.

Any weaknesses?

It is said his finishing could be improved but, on the evidence of last season, he has started to sharpen that side of his game and nine of his goals were sniffed out inside the penalty area. There was one effort against Stade Rennais, in particular, where he rolled his marker before hooking into the far corner, leaving the goalkeeper with no chance.

Strength: Riviere has a blistering turn of foot and enjoys a physical battle

Where will he fit in at Newcastle?

United’s lack of striking options – they have the out-of-favour and out-of-form Papiss Cisse and Spanish youngster Ayoze Perez – means they’re likely to start with one up front next season and that man should be Riviere. At 24 his best years are ahead of him and Newcastle scout Graham Carr has a proven track record of unearthing gems from Ligue 1.

How did he end up in the North-East?

Riviere has never hidden his desire to play in the Premier League but, having talked of a ‘dream’ move to Arsenal, it was Newcastle, Stoke and West Brom chasing his signature this summer. Monaco, with the fit-again Falcao, World Cup star Rodriguez and Dimitar Berbatov ahead of him in the pecking order were willing to sell and United matched their £6m asking price.
