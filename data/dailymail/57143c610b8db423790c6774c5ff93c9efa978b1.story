A century ago, King Island was a bustling community of 200 people who passed their days hunting seals and their long winter nights dancing beneath the wide Alaska skies.

But now, after a series of tragedies, the island stands deserted, reduced to a collection of crumbling, empty homes - a mere skeleton of the thriving neighborhood it once was.

Seventy years ago, as the island's men were shipped off to battle in World War II and a savage outbreak of tuberculosis claimed many of those left behind, numbers began to dwindle.

The lure of 
jobs and better medical care on the mainland also added to the exodus, and finally the 
Bureau of Indian affairs closed the island's only school in 1959 because of fears of a
 rock slide.

Abandoned: The residents of King Island in Alaska built their houses on stilts on the side of a jagged island

Settlement: Before a series of tragedies, a community had lived on the island for thousands of years

With
 their school closed, the remaining families were forced to begin a new 
life in the nearby mainland town of Nome - but the move brought a new series of hardships, with families 
separated, children put into care because of truancy laws, and others 
forced to attend boarding schools.

'In short, the fabric of King Island 
extended family life was shredded without cause,' the Alaska Dispatch reported. 'The stated reason for 
the move... was that a boulder was about to roll down the 
hill and crush the school. More than 50 years later, the boulder still hasn't moved.'

Before the tragedies and fears of rock slides, families had lived on the island - which is 40 miles west of the mainland - for thousands of years, propping their community up on the steep, rocky banks.

The island, which is just a mile long, was inhabited by a group of Inupiat who called themselves Ukivokmiut, which means 'People of the sea'. The small village was named Ukivok.

The men gained fame as hunters and ivory carvers, and survived on walrus, seal, birds and berries before heading to the mainland in the summer to sell their carvings.

Villagers: King Island residents in kayaks in an image taken around 1892. The kayaks are the characteristic King Island style as they carry more than one person or items on deck

Today, the mystique of the tiny deserted
 island lives on, with the granddaughter of former residents finally 
achieving her wish to visit their one-time home.

Joan Naviyuk Kane had been raising money
 to fund a two-week trip to King Island, a tiny village of houses built 
on sticks along the jagged island, when an unnamed foundation donated $32,000.

Ms Kane had been struggling to raise the money to visit when she received the anonymous gift.

'I'm still in disbelief,' Mrs Kane, who is half Inupiat, said. 'I've been trying to wrap my head around it.'

For years the 35-year-old, who lives with her husband and children in Anchorage, has felt drawn to the village, which was deserted in 1966. She wants to spend two weeks at the remote spot, taking photographs and finding inspiration for her writing.

Today: The village, built on the slope of the island, is now deserted following fears of rock slides

Treacherous: King Island is a mile in size and around 40 miles from the mainline, and 90 miles from Nome

On her fundraising page Mrs Kane says
 she wants to make the trip while 'My mother and her remaining siblings -
 as well as others who were born and raised on the island - are still 
alive, interested, and capable of making the trip together to ensure 
that King Islanders remain connected to our ancestors, culture, and 
place of origin'.

The 
writer, who is planning a novel about the 1971 Alaska Native Claims 
Settlement Act, hopes the trip will help others 'Gain an understanding 
of the challenges of reversing federal policy and returning people to 
their homes, even for a brief visit of several weeks'.

Reaching King Island is no easy feat.
 With no landing spot for a large boat, Mrs Kane will have to use a 
helicopter or small boat to reach the village. 

She will also need a tent that can stay 
up as strong winds blow across the deserted settlement, which is about 
90 miles from the gold rush town of Nome.

Roots: Poet Joan Naviyuk Kane is organizing a trip to the remote King Island to connect with her heritage

Memories: The poet plans to document her trip to the remote island, to preserve the Inupiat culture

Connection: Joan Naviyuk Kane holds a walrus ivory letter opener, carved by her grandfather who was one of the island's last residents

Ms Kane plans to set up a website
 about the ghost town, and had campaigned to raise funds for her trip on
 the fundraising site United States Artists.

She had raised more than $15,000 through her online campaign, when the anonymous group made its $32,000 donation. 

'It is unusual for an anonymous gift to 
come in this large,' USA program officer Armando Huipe told NewsTimes.com. 'But it's not uncommon for foundations 
and corporations to give to projects.'
