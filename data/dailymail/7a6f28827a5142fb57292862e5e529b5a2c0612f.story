Arsenal laboured to a goalless draw with Besiktas in the first-leg of their Champions League qualifier in Istanbul.

Former Chelsea striker Demba Ba almost embarrassed the Gunners with a shot straight from the kick-off but there is still all to play for in the second-leg at the Emirates, although Arsenal will be without Aaron Ramsey after the midfielder was sent off for a second bookable offence. 

Sportsmail reporter Matt Barlow was at the Ataturk Olympic Stadium to give his thoughts...

Grounds for complaint

Besiktas fans are not fond of their temporary home but they have made a good job of transporting their raucous din and spectacular forest of giant red-white-and-black flags to the Ataturk Olympic Stadium while their historic arena in Dolmabahce, on the banks of the Bosphorus, is rebuilt.

Home comforts: Besiktas fans create an intimidating atmosphere in their temporary Ataturk Stadium ground

Istanbul’s third club are responsible for bringing Champions League football back to the remote concrete basin where Liverpool won the trophy in 2005.

Identity change 

Former Fulham starlet Kerim Frei could be found on the Besiktas bench under his new Turkish identity. 

Turk that! Former Fulham midfielder Kerim Frei (L) has changed his name to Kerim Koyunlu

The 20-year-old former Swiss U21 international, who was actually born in Austria has a Turkish father and is now a fully-fledged Turkish international and he is known as Kerim Koyunlu. 

It was considered quite a coup with Fulham lured him from Grasshoppers as a teenager but he was never able to establish himself at Craven Cottage.

Room with a view 

The eight lane running track afforded Arsene Wenger and Slaven Bilic plenty of room to express themselves, in what must be some of the grandest technical areas at this stage of the competition.

Naughty step: Besiktas coach Slaven Bilic was sent to the stands after arguing with the referee Milorad Mazic

Ever-popular Bilic arrived with his rock star denims, hugging well-wishers and staff at the stadium gates, but was into his club suit for the game.

However, the former West Ham defender could not control his emotions and was sent to the stands towards the end of the game after arguing with  referee. 

Life's a pitch

Turkey hope this enormous venue will be earmarked for a key role in the city-hopping Euro 2020 finals but the quality of the pitch last night left a lot to be desired.

Bobbly: Arsene Wenger was not impressed by the state of the pitch at the Ataturk Olympic Stadium

Arsene Wenger, a stickler for this kind of thing, was not impressed. From way back in the stands it looked patchy and bobbly and Besiktas were certainly quicker when it came to finding the right rhythm on it.

Sign of respect

Besiktas had prepared what they claimed to be football’s biggest flag to unveil before the game in honour of their honorary president and former chairman Suleyman Seba, who died last week at the age of 88, but they were stopped from displaying it.

RIP: Both teams wore black armbands in honour of former Besiktas chairman Sulleyman Seba

There was, however, a moment of silence in his honour, which broke into applause and the players wore black armbands.
