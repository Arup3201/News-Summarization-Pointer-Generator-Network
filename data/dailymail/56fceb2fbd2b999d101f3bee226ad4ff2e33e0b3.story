Cindy Crawford has launched a meal delivery service that enables customers to follow a clean and healthy eating plan – without the restrictions of a traditional cleanse.  

The 48-year-old supermodel has teamed up with Neka Pasquale, the founder of organic food company Urban Remedy, to create Cindy's Essentials - a line of shakes, cold-pressed juices, snacks, meals and even caffeinated beverages that can be consumed in three days or spread out over the course of a week.

'It's not a cleanse,' she told Elle. 'That's such a thing, like: "Oh, I'm on a cleanse." But this is just having something as convenient as vending machine food that's good for you.'

Living simple: Cindy Crawford, 48, has teamed up with organic food company Urban Remedy to create Cindy's Essentials, a pre-planned meal service that includes shakes, snacks, lunches and dinners

Clean eating: One Cindy's Essentials plan costs $224.99 for three days and comes with juices, smoothies and meals, including a Mediterranean quinoa bowl and zucchini pasta

The kits, which cost $224.99 each, come complete with mint cacao chip smoothies, a variety of green juices, a series of snacks and three lunches and dinners, which include a variety of tasty dishes such as a shredded kale salad and vegetarian pad Thai.

Clean eating expert Neka reiterated that the eating plan is not a cleanse, although she added that following the plan will have a similar effect on anyone who is used to consuming a lot of processed foods.

Surprisingly, users can choose a kit that includes caffeinated beverages - which are typically banned in most clean eating plans.

But according to Cindy and Neka, not all caffeine is made equal.

Neka explained to the outlet that their plan's beverage options have 'special caffeine' which makes the drinks far healthier than your average cup of coffee or tea.

'It's cold-brewed coffee so it has less acid in it,' she said. 'And it has almond milk in it. And then the other option is a matcha tea with almond milk. They're healthy caffeine choices.'

Cindy stressed the importance of starting the day with a solid breakfast and noted that she has a protein shake every morning. The mother-of-one said she likes to have salads with lean protein for lunch and always allows herself to have healthy snacks like the sweet potato hummus and almonds available in her plan.

The model explained that she grew up eating junk food, but when she moved to New York she realized she was not one of those models who could eat whatever they wanted without suffering the consequences.

However, when she started paying attention to food trends, she found that there were often contradictory messages.

'It is confusing to decipher between diet fads, ingredient trends and true expertise, and – like everyone – I was overwhelmed until I met Neka,' she said in a recent statement about her new food-focused venture.  

She added: 'Together, we want to make it easier for people to access credible information and healthy well-balanced food that tastes great.'

Cindy is joining slew of celebrities who have debuted their own eating plans and meal delivery services. 

Gwyneth Paltrow touts her detox plans, which eliminate coffee, alcohol, sugar, eggs, wheat, meat and processed foods, on her website Goop.

She also published a detox friendly cookbook titled It's All Good in 2013. 

Earlier this month, Beyonce and her trainer Marco Borges launched 22 Days Nutrition, a vegan meal plan.

The singer was inspired to create the on-demand meal service after consuming only plant-based foods for 22 days.
