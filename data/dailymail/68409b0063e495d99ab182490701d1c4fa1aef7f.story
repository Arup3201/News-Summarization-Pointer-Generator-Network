Benefits cheat: Kevin Meredith, 44, claimed almost £40,000 from the public purse despite entering £27,000 worth of premium bonds in the monthly £1million prize draw

A benefits cheat claimed almost £40,000 from the public purse despite entering £27,000 worth of premium bonds in the monthly £1million prize draw.

Kevin Meredith, 44, fiddled benefits for five years while his haul of bonds was entered in the ERNIE draw each month.

The father-of-four, who had just short of the £30,000 maximum in premium bonds, received £34,835 in income support and £3,126 in council tax subsidies over the course of five years.

Meredith narrowly avoided an immediate prison sentence after admitting one count of benefit fraud at Cardiff Crown Court.

Prosecutor Gareth Evans told how when the authorities eventually caught up with Meredith, he told them: 'Usually I’m ethical but this started and I couldn’t see a way out of it.

'I couldn’t think of a way of stopping it and putting things right.'

The court heard that Meredith also failed to disclose the fact he earned a further  £600 a month by renting out a property, in addition to another house that he was buying.

Owen Williams, defending, said kitchen designer of Meredith, Bridgend, South Wales, was in 'financial hardship' after his wife left him in 2008.

Mr Williams said: 'He is the sole carer for his son, now eight years old, and looks after his elderly parents.

'He is hard working and and is not proud of what he has done.'

Recorder Jeremy Jenkins said Meredith’s cheating richly deserved an 18-month prison sentence.

However, he said that, for the sake of Meredith's young son and his elderly parents, it would be suspended for two years.

He also ordered him to carry out 180 hours unpaid community work and pay £1,740 costs.

Recorder Jenkins said: 'The benefit system is there for those in need not for people to abuse.

'Taxpayers justifiably feel cheated when they realise their hard-earned taxes are being stolen from them.'
