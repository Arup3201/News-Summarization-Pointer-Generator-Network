Whether snuggling up together on the sofa or chasing each other round the garden,Teagan, a vixen, and Cora, a Siberian husky, do everything together.

Usually pitted against each other in the name of hunting, the unlikely but adorable pair have become inseparable since the young fox cub was adopted into the family in 2013.

This adorable pair- Teagan, a vixen, and Cora, a Siberian husky-  do everything together

In scenes reminiscent of the 1981 film The Fox And The Hound, in which a young fox befriends a puppy, the couple have photographed them playing together in their garden.

Chris and Ashley Daley, both 27, from Chicago, obtained Teagan from a certified breeder in Illinois, where it is legal to breed the animal if you obtain a special permit.

And seven-year-old Cora, who was adopted from an animal shelter at age three, was quick to take Teagan under her wing.

Graphic designer Ashley said: 'As anyone can see when you watch them together, they have a special bond.

'Cora is a very friendly dog, and Teagan just got attached to Cora. When in playing mode, if Teagan doesn't want Cora to take something, Teagan will put her back to Cora and will often sit on Cora's head, but there's no malice.

'If Teagan starts playing rough, Cora will push her down with her paw which is her way of telling her to calm down.

'That is how we know those two get along so well. It's all rough and tumble, they never actually fight.'

Chris and Ashley Daley, both 27, from Chicago, had done extensive research before they decided to get a fox cub

The couple raised the fox cub like a puppy and now Teagan and Cora go for walks and play fetch together. Teagan - who they compare to a cross between a cat and a dog - can even perform tricks such as 'paw' and 'sit'. 

Chris, a logistics manager, said: 'Foxes are known to be compared to a cat and a dog.

'Teagan is fully domesticated and lives in the house with us. We got Teagan when she was about six weeks old and have raised her like you would a puppy, but still treat her like fox in some areas because they are not puppies and require some special treatment.

'But Teagan has always wagged her tail when she sees Cora, and us, of course. They both just love being together and playing non-stop.

'They literally are a Fox And The Hound kind of story.'  

To adopt a fox in Chicago, Illinois, the owner must purchase the animal from a licensed breeder and pay an annual fee for a Fur-bearing Mammal Breeder Permit, which can be sought from the local authority.
