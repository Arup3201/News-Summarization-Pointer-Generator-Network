TV star Mario Lopez has been given a guided tour of Alaska by the state's most famous resident - and one-time governor - Sarah Palin.

The Extra host posted a series of Instagram pictures on Wednesday as he revealed details of his trip, which included tucking into a homemade moose casserole cooked by Palin's mother.

Lopez was in Alaska to interview the former vice-presidential candidate as she begins filming for her new series, Amazing America with Sarah Palin.

His visit may have been short but Lopez, who used to star in children's show Saved by the Bell, was given a whirlwind tour of Palin's 'back yard'.

His adventure was accompanied by a series of tweets and pictures that showed giant heaps of moose antlers piled outside the drive of the Palin house, a stuffed bear standing guard at his hotel, and a bone from a walrus penis.

The 40-year-old TV personality interviewed the former governor on decking overlooking a serene lake in her backyard.

'Getting the 411 on all things Alaska from Sarah Palin,' he tweeted on Wednesday afternoon. 'Shooting new episodes of Amazing America.'

The Thursday night show on the Sportsman
 channel features wrestlers, hunters, pastors who moonlight as NASCAR 
drivers, and traditional craftsmen from around the U.S.

Lopez appeared to enjoy the natural beauty of Alaska's lakes and mountains, but seemed less sure about the antlers decorating the Palin house.

'Just like Gaston in Beauty and the Beast. "He uses antlers in all of his decorating". Exactly like that,' he tweeted in response to a comment from one of his followers.

It wasn't all work for Lopez who found time to fit in some off-roading with Palin's husband Todd, and to sample some home-cooking.

His interview and comments remained light-hearted, and he even joked: 'BTW ... didn't see Russia from her house,' as an aside to the Tina Fey sketch about Palin on Saturday Night Live, during the 2008 election campaign.
