For 20 long years the disappearance of beautiful blonde dancer Revelle Balmain has remained a mystery.

The 22-year-old vanished on November 5, 1994, almost without a trace except for one cork-heeled platform shoe.

The high-heel was found two days later in a street in Kingsford, a south-eastern suburb of Sydney, scattered alongside Revelle’s cane make-up bag, diary and the keys to her Bellevue Hill unit.

It was the first worrying indication police had that Revelle may have been harmed, but two decades later her killer has still not been caught and a $250,000 reward for information leading to an arrest remains on offer from the NSW Government.

Dancer Revelle Balmain vanished at the age of 22 from a suburban Sydney street 

The blue-eyed 5ft 8 model was preparing to embark on a six-month dance contract in Japan and had planned to meet a girlfriend on the night of the 5 November for a drink. She never showed up.

‘Later that evening she was to meet her boyfriend, but failed to keep this appointment as well. Her girlfriend last spoke to her by phone at 7:15pm,’ Revelle’s half-sister Sueellen Simpson told the media back in 1994.

The alarm was officially raised when Revelle also failed to catch the 9.30am train from Sydney to Newcastle the next day, to say goodbye to her mother before she travelled to Japan.

What Revelle’s family didn’t know at the time was that the stunning model was leading a double-life and secretly working as an escort for two high-end agencies.

She was about to embark on a six-month dance contract in Japan, following in her mother's footsteps

Police found her belongings, including one wedge shoe and her hand bag, scattered across four streets 

On the day of her disappearance she had gone to a house on McNair Avenue, in Kingsford, to visit a client named Gavin Owen Samer.

Mr Samer has always maintained to police that he then drove Revelle to the nearby Red Tomato Inn at 7pm that evening, but no one from the Inn ever saw her.

Police also spotted scratches on Mr Samer's neck, chest and hands  but he explained he got the injuries from surfing.

Mr Samer was named the main person of interest during a coronial inquiry in 1998 and 1999 but no charges against him were ever laid.

He denied any suggestions that he may have killed her and Deputy State Coroner John Abernethy said he could not identify any motive.

‘While Mr Samer certainly had the opportunity to kill Ms Balmain, and rightly in my view is the main person of interest to police, there is no plausible motive proved,’ Mr Abernethy said.

Mr Abernethy declined to comment on the case when questioned by Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday.

A Department of Justice spokesman said: 'He said he conducted the inquest a long time ago and it would be difficult for him to recall precise details.'

Revelle's family plastered missing person photographs around the city. 'We are desperately concerned for her safety and welfare,' the posters said 

Revelle was reportedly working for two high-end escort agencies at the time of her disappearance 

The inquiry also looked into the theory that a person associated with the escort agency, Select Companions, she was working with may have had something to do with her disappearance.

Revelle had worked at the agency for six weeks but had fallen in love with a new boyfriend, Piers Fisher-Pollard, and had decided to leave escort work.

Mr Samer was meant to be her final client.

When the man from the escort agency was questioned he told the police and the inquiry differing tales of his whereabouts on the day Revelle vanished. He has always maintained his innocence.

In 2008, Homicide Detective Superintendent Geoff Beresford announced police had new information and forensic test results relating to the case.

The evidence reportedly renewed the theory that Revelle was murdered at a house in Kingsford.

'A full forensic search was carried out of the crime scene at Kingsford during the last 12 months,' Detective Superintendent Beresford told The Australian. 'We are able to say we have fresh evidence as a result of those investigations.'

Around the same time as the breakthrough, the Daily Telegraph reported that the main person of interest, Mr Samer, had disappeared from Sydney.

Police allegedly wanted to find him so that they could take a DNA sample.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted NSW Police to find out if they are still looking for Mr Samer, but has not yet received a response.

NSW Deputy State Coroner John Abernethy (pictured) said led a coronial inquiry into Revelle's disappearance in 1998 and 1999. He declared it was a cold case and should remain open

Appearing on the ABC’s The 7:30 Report in September 2008, Revelle’s half-sister Suellen described the pain the family still felt 14 years on.

‘The not knowing is the worst. Last week, I saw one girl who looked like Revelle and it took my breath away. I thought my heart would stop because she was so similar to Revelle,’ she said.

‘Fourteen years is a long time to wonder where she is and who murdered her. Why should someone murder her and think that they can walk away and just forget about it. We're not ever going to forget about it - ever. I won't let it happen,’ Suellen added.

For Jan, 79, and Ivor Balmain, their daughter Revelle was everything. Their son Matthew had drowned in the pool in their backyard aged just 15 months.

Revelle had previously spent 18 months in Japan before returning to Sydney and landing a front cover on Oyster magazine in the years before she vanished

Jan had also been a dancer in her youth and she set up a dance school on Sydney’s northern beaches where she raised Revelle and Suellen, her daughter from a previous relationship.

In 2006, Jan told Marie Claire Australia how ‘Revelle became the main focus’ of their lives after Matthew died and they could not conceive any more children.

‘We sent her to a private school, I taught her ballet, tap and jazz, and she rewarded us by growing up into a very warm, kind and happy little girl,’ she said. 

‘Years later, when she told me that she wanted to follow in my footsteps and become a professional dancer, I was thrilled and through friends, helped her to get a contract performing in hotels in Japan. I made sure she wouldn’t be doing anything seedy, although I never worried that she would anyway,’ Jan recalled.

Revelle spent 18 months in Japan before returning to Sydney and landing a front cover on Oyster magazine. Her career was taking off and her parents had never been prouder.

After Revelle disappeared and Jan and Ivor’s world was shattered they eventually moved to Queensland to escape the haunting memories.

Tragically Ivor died in 2010 with his daughter’s murder unsolved.

Two decades later her killer has still not been caught and a $250,000 reward for information leading to an arrest remains on offer from the NSW Government

Meanwhile, Revelle’s sister Suellen has never stopped looking for answers. During the first 18 months after the model vanished, Suellen called investigating officers every day and was told she ‘needed counselling’.

She believed police did not do all they could in the early stages of Revelle’s disappearance because of the fact that she was an escort.

She told the Herald Sun in 2011: ‘I never stopped thinking she might walk through a door, make that call or turn up somewhere.’ 

It has now been 7304 days since Revelle Balmain was last seen alive and the Cinderella mystery remains unsolved. 

NSW Police told Daily Mail Australia: 'Strike Force Aramac, led by detectives from the Homicide Squad, continues to investigate the disappearance and suspected murder of Revelle Balmain.

'Investigators encourage anyone with information concerning Ms Balmain, no matter how small or insignificant it may seem, to contact Crime Stoppers via 1800 333 000.'
