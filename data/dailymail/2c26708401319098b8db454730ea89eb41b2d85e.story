David Cameron’s credibility has been ‘blown away’ by his Government’s cosy relationship with Rupert Murdoch, a former Tory Cabinet minister warned yesterday.

David Mellor said the Prime Minister had shown poor judgment in appointing Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt to preside over Mr Murdoch’s controversial £8billion bid for BSkyB.

He warned it was inevitable that Mr Hunt would have to resign.

And he suggested Mr Cameron was also badly damaged by his decision to appoint Mr Hunt despite warnings from Government lawyers that he was biased in favour of Mr Murdoch.

As he spoke out, Nick Clegg delivered his own thinly veiled attack on Mr Hunt’s relationship with the Murdoch empire.

But the Liberal Democrat leader risked charges of hypocrisy after details emerged of his own friendship with the media mogul’s fixer, Fred Michel.

Mr Mellor – himself a former Culture Secretary – said there would be ‘a number of scalps’ as a result of the evidence emerging at the Leveson Inquiry into Press standards.

He added: ‘Jeremy Hunt, and I regret this because I admire him, will probably have to go. But the real scalp is the Prime Minister. He won’t have to resign but his credibility is blown away – he appears to be rather a shallow, callow sort of guy who doesn’t have too many aims and ambitions and who can’t even get basic judgment calls right.

‘Every part of the system failed. Jeremy himself probably should have realised he could not take on that quasi-judicial function. The Prime Minister should not have asked him.

‘When the Prime Minister asks you to do something, you tend to do it. But where was the civil service in all this? They are supposed to be the protectors of the integrity of government.’

Asked why the Prime Minister was continuing to back Mr Hunt, Mr Mellor replied: ‘Because he knows the road leads to him.’

Too friendly: Last week it emerged Mr Hunt had exchanged numerous cosy messages with Mr Michel in which they referred to each other as 'daddy' and 'papa'

Mr Clegg also twisted the knife yesterday when he said: ‘It is unhealthy when politicians end up in the pockets of media moguls. When vested interests are allowed to twist politicians around their little fingers things go wrong.’

Last week it emerged that Mr Hunt’s office exchanged hundreds of texts and emails with Mr Michel.

Most of the messages involved Mr Hunt’s special adviser Adam Smith, who has since been forced to resign.

But they also included numerous cosy messages between Mr Hunt and Mr Michel in which they referred to each other as ‘daddy’ and ‘papa’. The two men’s wives gave birth at the same London hospital in late May 2010.

Asked about the tone of the messages, Mr Clegg said a situation had been able to develop ‘in a way that was untransparent, not subject to scrutiny, and you didn’t have basic checks and balances on people in positions of power’.

Mr Clegg’s attack came as the Liberal Democrats seek to exploit the Conservatives’ discomfort over their links to News Corporation.But details later emerged of his own friendship with Mr Michel.

Lib Dem sources confirmed Mr Clegg played tennis with Mr Michel on a ‘handful of occasions’ before he became Deputy Prime Minister.

The two men also had a number of informal conversations at the gates of the primary school in London’s fashionable Putney district where they both send their children.

Documents released to the Leveson Inquiry also reveal that a number of senior Lib Dems were in close contact with Mr Michel. Mr Clegg’s press secretary Lena Pietsch even invited him for talks in Downing Street while the BSkyB bid was being considered by Government last year.

Meanwhile, it emerged yesterday that Mr Clegg is considering sending his eldest son Antonio to a £30,000-a-year private school. Only last week, he hit out at the ‘corrosive’ impact on society of the divide between state and private schools.

A spokesman for Mr Clegg said Antonio would not go to secondary school until the autumn of next year and no decision had been taken.
