A stewardess who experienced the glamor of the sixties flying across the globe for the stylish Pan American World Airways is sharing her tales serving the rich and famous.

In her new book, Up in the Air, Betty Riegel shares stories of the rich and famous who walked the aisles of the 
international flights she worked on.

She was on hand in 1964 when the 
Beatles made their momentous arrival to the U.S. and also served The 
Mamas and The Papas when they flew to London from LA.

The airline gave strict instructions 
that famous passengers be treated no differently than the rest, guidance
Riegel took to heart when she had to politely turn down actor Peter 
Lawford, who was married to JFK's sister Patricia Kennedy, when he 
obnoxiously demanded an upgrade to first class.

Betty Riegel, nee Eden, had worked in
her native England for a regional airline but was enticed to try out as
a flight attendant for the American airline at the age of 22 in the 
sixties. 

She joined the thousands of other 
British beauties who lined up to see if they would be among the handful 
chosen for the enchanting post.

At that time, flight attendants were 
expected to have the looks of supermodels, the talents of a star 
housewife and the safety sense of an emergency responder (including 
knowing how to deliver a baby).

Beauties on board: Pan Am stewardess had to be single with 'good moral character' (June Fogg models a black-and-white lounge suit during a fashion show on board a Pan American flight in July 1946)

Times change: Pan Am attendants were expected to create the seven-course banquets that were served in the first class cabin

Spacious: There was no cramped seating for passengers on board the Boeing Pan Am 747 jet in December 1969

For a young woman to be considered 
she must weigh between 110 and 134 lbs, be between the ages of 21 and 
27, single and of good moral character. 

The eager Riegel went up against thousands of other British applicants who desired the exciting life of travel.

She underwent a strict selection process that 
included translating a passage from French into English, walking about a
room to show off her posture and ultimately, a public weigh-in.

Style: Stewardesses were styled by the most sought after hairdressers and sent to make-up school

Service and style: Pan Am stewardesses were said to be as desirable as supermodels, and were also expected to 
offer impeccable service as they provided meals and drinks to customers

Clientele: Pan Am passengers included royalty, wealthy businessmen and 
famous celebrities (left, actor Laurence Olivier and his wife Vivien

After impressing the judges, Riegel 
was selected to join Pan Am as a stewardess and she was sent to San 
Francisco in 1961 to work for the airlines.

Before she could begin her post, she had to undergo six weeks of intensive training.

'It was like a finishing school, par excellence,' she told Delaware Online about her days in the skies.

'We learned meal service, international customs, geography.'

The striking stewardess shared in an interview with the Daily Express that though the air hostesses were not encouraged to openly flirt with male passengers, they were allowed to entertain male suitors that expressed interest (if they so desired).

She tells the tale of a Saudi prince, who had the reputation of a playboy, who asked for a date but she demurely declined, getting the plane captain to stand as her advocate.

'In those days, if a man asked you for dinner, you went out for dinner and that’s all. You had to watch out for the married men, though.

Some of them would take off their wedding rings and cover the mark with Man Tan, a new fake tan lotion that had just come out,' she said.
