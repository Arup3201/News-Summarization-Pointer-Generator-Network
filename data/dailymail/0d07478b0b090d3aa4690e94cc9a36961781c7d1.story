Between sleepless nights, nappy changing and post-natal blues, getting back to work is often the last thing on the minds of new mothers.

Fully immersing oneself in the world of new parenthood can be all-consuming. So it's perhaps understandable that when mothers do eventually return to the office, it takes them at least four months to get back up to speed.

According to a new study, six in 10 mothers find readjusting to the workplace challenging, with an average of 3.8 months required to get back into the swing of things.

The study also revealed that many mothers share similar concerns about returning to work - chief among them the fear that they might bore childless colleagues with baby talk.

Other mothers panicked about accidentally arriving at work with fingerprints and food stains on their clothes, while 17 per cent said they were worried about missing their child.

On a more positive note, just 10 per cent thought they might run into trouble with their boss by making regular calls to their childminder.

Of the new mothers who do choose to return to work, 40 per cent said they do so because of financial pressure.

But three quarters admitted that they wouldn't be happy to go out to work if it meant their partner stayed at home instead.

'Returning to work can be a daunting shift and can lead to feelings of 
insecurity and lack of confidence,' said psychologist Dr Linda Papadopoulos.

'As well as worrying about getting 
back into the job you also have to juggle childcare needs. Get into a 
routine so that the mornings run smoothly.'

She continued: 'Lay clothes out the night 
before, fill the kettle up and put things by the front door that you 
need to remember.

'When at work don’t be afraid to ask questions, nobody 
is going to expect you to know everything on your first day back.'

The survey, which was carried out by Proctor & Gamble, found that new mothers employed a variety of ways to boost their confidence, including splashing out on new clothes and a new hair cut.

Others said having an early night, wearing their favourite outfit and updating their hair colour also helped.

Among those to treat themselves ahead of a return to the office was homes guru and P&G Everyday Effect ambassador, Kirstie Allsopp.

'I had a new hairstyle, new clothes and bought a new handbag both times,' she revealed.

1. Let go of any feelings of guilt 
about going back to work. I know from working with families that this is
often an issue for parents but remember that you’re setting a good 
example for your children and helping to provide for them.

2. As with any big change, nerves are inevitable, but remember all the 
things that you enjoyed about your working life before parenthood and 
focus on the positive transferable skills that you’ve learned from having
your child.

3. Balancing 
work and home life is a challenge that we all face. Discuss your options
with your partner and family and friends, and have back up plans in 
case something crops up at work or at home.

4. Be honest with yourself and with your employer and colleagues. Don’t be
afraid to be open about your concerns – often those around you will be 
able to support you in dealing with them.

5. Boost your confidence: new make-up, fresh hair colour and wearing your 
favourite outfit can all help you feel more confident on that first day 
back.
