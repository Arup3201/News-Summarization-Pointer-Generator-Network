A retired caretaker who rides a mobility scooter customised to look like a Harley Davidson has told how he is repeatedly pulled over by police - for riding a motorcycle on the pavement.

Geoff Dickson, a 64-year-old from Wells in Somerset, says he is fed-up with officers mistaking his £6,000 electric scooter for the on-the-road version it had been designed to look like.

Nicknamed 'The Wells Angel' by his neighbours, Mr Dickson says his three-wheeled vehicle is fully legal to ride on the pavement as it is limited to a top speed of just four miles per hour.

Young at heart: Geoff Dickson, 64, says he is fed-up with officers mistaking his £6,000 customised electric scooter for a Harley Davidson motorcycle as he rides around the streets of Wells in Somerset

Customised: The eccentric vehicle, which cost £6,000, has been set to a top speed of just four miles per hour, which means Mr Dickson is regularly overtaken by 'little old ladies' with their machines on 'road mode'

Mr Dickson says he is repeatedly pulled over for potentially breaking the law by riding on the pavement and has even been tracked down in cafes after parking his machine outside.

The father-of-three says officers soon back down when they take a closer look at his eccentric vehicle, however.

Describing the customised machine, Mr Dickson says: 'I was told I had to get a mobility scooter so I went to a local store, but all I saw were pink things with baskets on the front - I really wasn't impressed.'

'The woman in the shop asked me what I would be interested in so I told her I wanted something that would go off-road and that looked like a Harley Davidson.'

'Just because you are old and disabled doesn't mean you can't be cool too... They hunted around and showed me the one they had found.'

'Some people call me 'The Wells Angel' and that's fine - it's only rock n' roll but I like it.'

Mr Dickson got the scooter last summer after he was diagnosed with HSP - a condition that kills his nerves and has left him unable to control his legs.

But he was horrified by the thought of getting an 'old fashioned' scooter designed for pensioners and approached his local retailer to ask if they could source something different.

The Sport Rider model he purchased features chrome-style forks and handlebars and a large central headlight like a motorbike.

His unusual mode of transport quickly attracted the attention of the local police, however.

He said: 'I was driving along the pavement when a police car drove past me then quickly spun around and pulled over.'

'When they got out the car one of them was nudging the other and they were laughing... One of them said 'sorry, brains over here thought you were riding a motorbike on the pavement'. Afterwards they just kept pushing each other and laughing,' he added.

Although police in Somerset repeatedly mistake Geoff Dickson's mobility scooter for a Harley Davidson, the only real comparison between the two vehicles is their appearance.

While the Harley can comfortably reach a top speed of 110mph, Mr Dickson's scooter is limited to just 4mph in order to make it legal to drive on the pavement.

It is, however, capable of reaching 8mph if its engine is switched from 'street mode' to 'road mode'. Mr Dickson says this is the setting many 'little old ladies' in the town of Wells are using when they speed past his customised scooter.

The Sport Rider vehicle is powered by a 100ah 12V x 2 battery which last for between 30 and 32 hours of continuous riding between charges.

The 'Fat Boy', on the other hand, has a classic air-cooled, six-speed engine which sits on the outside of the bike and helps make it instantly recognisable as a Harley Davidson.

When it comes to braking ability, a Harley Davidson 'Fat Bay' uses four-piston front brakes and two-piston rear brakes which allow it to reduce speed safely and comfortably.

Although Mr Dickson's Sport Rider comes to an equally luxurious halt, it needs only a small electromagnetic brake to slow down, with much of the speed control influenced by the opening and closing of the throttle.

Finally there is a huge difference in price between the two vehicles, with a brand new Harley Davidson 'Fat Boy'  costing a minimum £15,995. The Sport Rider, meanwhile, can be bought for as little as £3,500 if you aren't interested in additional customisation work.

Not tearing up the neighbourhood: Mr Dickson said that a police officer once came up to him while he was drinking coffee in a cafe and asked to take a photo of the vehicle

Easy mistake: Geoff Dickson says police who repeatedly mistake his scooter for a Harley Davidson soon back down when they take a closer look

Describing why he purchased the customised machine, Mr Dickson said: 'I was told I had to get a mobility scooter so I went to a local store, but all I saw were pink things with baskets on the front - I wasn't impressed'

Mr Dickson said that on another occasion a different police officer came up to him while he was drinking coffee in a cafe as he had left the vehicle parked outside.

'He was going to tell me off for parking on the pavement but then he realised his mistake and asked if they could take a picture of it instead,' Mr Dickson said.

Mr Dickson says he has now become something of a local celebrity and has even earned his own nickname.

He said: 'People around here think it's great - they all call me the 'Wells Angel' - people are always stopping me and asking for a picture.'

'Having this mobility scooter has really changed my life, I was so against the idea of amobility scooter at first and now they can't get me off it,' he added.

'I've got my speed set to four miles per hour which is walking speed, so quite often little old ladies who have left 'road mode' on come speeding right past me in their pink scooters with baskets - it's very funny.'

Mr Dickson's vehicle can theoretically reach eight miles per hour but has had its top speed limited.

He says his vehicle is battery powered and can go about 32 miles on a single charge, allowing him to visit the nearby Somerset Levels to take photographs.

'It has really given me my mobility back - I wouldn't be able to get anywhere without it now,' he said.

Mr Dickson says that, as well as making him feel cool, his choice in mobility scooter had made others feel better about using them.

He said: 'There is a young lad down the road who for some reason or another needed a mobility scooter... He really didn't like the idea but then he saw mine and he couldn't wait to get one.'

'If you're still young at heart and you need a mobility scooter then you should get one likethis,' he added.
