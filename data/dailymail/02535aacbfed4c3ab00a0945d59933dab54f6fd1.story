Part-time firefighter Daniel Howard has been killed after a wall collapsed during a blaze at a pub in western NSW

A part-time firefighter  has been killed and another injured after a wall collapsed while they were trying to put out a blaze at a pub in western NSW.

Fire crews were responding to a fire at the New Occidental Hotel in Cobar, about 690km west of Sydney, on Sunday morning at 8am when the 37-year-old was killed.

'It is with a heavy heart I confirm the death of a Fire and Rescue NSW officer in the state’s west today,' Minister for Emergency Services Stuart Ayres said.

'The officer was attending a fire at a hotel in Cobar when a wall collapsed and he suffered what is believed to be cardiac arrest.'

'As a member of Fire & Rescue NSW, this man selflessly dedicated his life to the safety of his community,' Mr Ayres said. 

'On behalf of the people of NSW, our thoughts and prayers are today with the officer’s family, friends and fellow firefighters.'

Daniel Howard was taken via ambulance to Dubbo Base Hospital three hours away where he was pronounced dead.

Mr Howard leaves behind his partner Jenna Batistich, who has a three-year-old son, reported The Daily Telegraph.

Friend and Cobar Camels club president Jarrod Marsden said Mr Howard had been a part-time firefighter for about five years and was meant to be away at the time the accident happened.
