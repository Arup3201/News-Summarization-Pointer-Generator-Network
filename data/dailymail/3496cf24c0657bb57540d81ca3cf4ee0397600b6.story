A heartbroken father killed himself on a family holiday meant to save his marriage after discovering text messages on his wife's phone from her new lover, an inquest heard.

Alun Rogers was found hanging by wife Rhiannon, 34, in the bathroom of their hotel shortly after he came across the messages from a man called Matt.

The couple, who had been married for five years and had two children, aged five and eight, had decided to take a make-or-break trip to Icmeler, Turkey, in a last-ditch attempt to repair their relationship which had been marred by her infidelity, the coroner was told.

But instead of helping the marriage, his wife spent the trip ‘playing emotional games’, the coroner said.

Mrs Rogers told the inquest in a 
statement: ‘Our marriage was experiencing difficulties.

Rhiannon Rogers, pictured on a family holiday in Cornwall, told the inquest her husband was angry when he found the texts from a love rival

'We were 
separated and he was living with his parents.

'We went ahead with the 
holiday for the sake of our children. We had massive rows.

‘I had a new boyfriend and Alun found texts from him on my mobile phone. He was angry.’

Returning a verdict of suicide, Newport deputy coroner Wendy James said: ‘He was given conflicting signs from his wife.

‘During the time in Turkey she was playing emotional games.’

Alun’s father Gary told the inquest in Newport, South Wales, their five-year-long marriage had been damaged by her infidelity.

He said: ‘Alun had a suspicion Rhiannon was with a new man.

‘She had two previous affairs and even got pregnant, but Alun took her back.’

Alun had 
moved back into his parents’ home when the relationship hit rock bottom,
but they still harboured hope to resurrect the marriage for the sake of
their children, the inquest heard.

The couple decided to take the trip to Turkey and agreed to see marriage counsellors on their return from the holiday in 
September last year, the inquest was told.

But Mrs Rogers returned to their hotel room locked. Staff let her in and she found Alun dead.

Rhiannon is now thought to have moved from the family home in Caerphilly, Gwent
