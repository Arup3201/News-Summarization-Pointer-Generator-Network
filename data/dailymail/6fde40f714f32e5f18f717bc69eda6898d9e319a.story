Jeff Kinney has overtaken Roald Dahl as the most popular author in British schools - and David Walliams is fast catching up.

Kinney, who penned the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series, pipped Dahl to first place in a top 10 list of the most-read children’s authors.

Walliams, meanwhile, moved up the chart faster than any author, eclipsing JK Rowling and Michael Morpurgo to take fifth spot.

The comic, who created the Little Britain TV series, has written seven novels for children, with titles such as Mr Stink and Gangsta Granny.

The trends emerged in the latest in a series of annual studies analysing the reading habits of tens of thousands of British schoolchildren.

It found that Kinney, whose series features a young boy’s struggles with school and family, has pulled ahead of Dahl for the first time despite publishing a relatively small number of books.

In an ‘extremely creditable performance’, Walliams was a new entrant in the top 10, behind Kinney, Dahl, Roderick Hunt, who wrote the Oxford Reading Tree series, and Francesca Simon, with the Horrid Henry books.

The sixth annual ‘What Kids are Reading’ report, which covered 426,000 children in more than 2,000 schools, also found that children’s reading habits deterioriate sharply when they reach secondary school.

Up until the age of ten, the difficulty of books that children choose and the amount they read shows a steady increase.

But interest then dwindles, with many older children - including academic high-fliers - choosing books that are too easy for them, including books about football and star players.

‘There is a marked downturn in the difficulty of books at secondary transfer and this does not necessarily reflect a lack of ability to read more difficult texts,’ said the report’s author, Professor Keith Topping, of Dundee University.

‘It seems that secondary teachers and librarians are not encouraging students to attack more difficult books to a sufficient degree.’

He added: ‘Non-fiction needs to be read more widely but students need better guidance on reading at a level of difficulty which challenges them, as the difficulty of much non-fiction read in the later years was extremely low.’ 

Among teenagers, books about sport and football - such as biographies of Wayne Rooney and David Beckham - dominate the non-fiction charts. The titles ‘are appealing to older boys’ but may not be challenging enough for their ability levels.

Boys and girls were found to choose books of equal difficulty, reversing a trend seen last year where girls were picking out more challenging books.

The study analysed data from Renaissance Learning software, which assesses which books are being read in schools and tests children’s understanding of them through a series of quizzes.

James Bell, the software firm’s professional services director, said: ‘The difficulty of books read and the accuracy with which they are understood is in fact on the rise, but there is still a significant problem with lack of challenge.’
