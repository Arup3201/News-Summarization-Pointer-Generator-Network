Ministers were under growing pressure last night to toughen up measures to protect the public from ebola.

They have already promised to review airport screening after Scottish nurse Pauline Cafferkey was allowed home despite complaining of a fever – and having her temperature checked seven times at Heathrow.

Other colleagues who returned at the same time described the system at the airport as ‘shambolic’ and said they had to queue in cramped rooms where the virus could be passed on to others.

Experts have called for healthcare workers returning from West Africa to be kept away from public places for at least three weeks – the time it can take for the virus to develop and for symptoms to appear.

At the moment, they can travel home on crowded buses and trains and continue using them during the 21-day incubation period.

In US states such as New York and New Jersey, volunteers returning from West Africa are effectively quarantined in their own homes and must avoid public places including football matches for at least three weeks. Labour MP Keith Vaz, who chairs the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said: ‘It’s time to review and assess the arrangements.

‘The Government was right to bring in screening, but there are various degrees of screening.

‘We need to know how many people have been put in place at our borders and how many are trained – immigration officers are not equipped to deal with this. The Government needs to be clear about who they are, what training they have received and what equipment they have at their disposal.

‘The Home Secretary needs to confirm that no immigration officers are involved in this process.’

Dr Devi Sridhar, of Edinburgh University, said quarantining might be too strict but as a compromise, returning health workers could be told to avoid public places.

She added: ‘The Government feels pressure to act.

‘But in the UK ebola has not until now been an issue, while in the US there was a sense of mass hysteria.

‘But there is a middle way we could adopt where people coming back from countries affected by ebola are told to avoid busy public places for the three-week incubation period.’

Officials are also under pressure to change temperature tests. These are currently the most accurate and quickest way to diagnose the illness, because a sudden fever is one of the earliest symptoms.

Blood tests do not work because ebola can only be detected once a patient already has symptoms, such as a fever or vomiting.

At the moment, any healthcare worker who is 37.5C (99.5F) or above – compared with the normal body temperature of 37C (98.6F) – is sent to hospital for tests. But one option would be to bring this down to a more precise figure such as 37.2 or 37.3C.

Another would be to ensure workers remain in a secure area for at least 24 hours while they undergo repeated checks on their temperature

Miss Cafferkey, 39, had her temperature tested at Heathrow but then complained she had a fever while still at the airport and it was then checked a further six times over an hour but was still deemed normal.

Treatment: The nurse has been transferred to the specialist high-level isolation wing of London's Royal Free Hospital

Yet just 12 hours later it had rocketed and she was in an isolation unit. Had she been made to stay at the airport this would have been picked up.

Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer, said: ‘Clearly queuing and things like that are unacceptable and we will review. But we will let people who are well travel because they will not infect the public.’

Speaking of Miss Cafferkey, 

she added: ‘She was well. She had no symptoms. Her temperature was within the acceptable range. She would not be transmitting the virus, therefore she was cleared as fit to fly.’

A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘This person was tested as part of the screening process at Heathrow and, as with all health workers, she was advised to contact Public Health England if she had any concerns.

‘She did this, while still at Heathrow, and went through a further six temperature checks. Naturally, we will be reviewing what happened and the screening protocols, and if anything needs to be changed it will be.’

Here are some of the options that ministers wanting to bring in tougher measures to protect the public may consider:

BLOOD TEST 

This is used to confirm ebola in a patient who has symptoms. But scientists say it would not pick up the virus unless someone has symptoms, so would therefore be pointless.

KEEP THEM AT AIRPORT 

Currently, the process for returning healthcare workers lasts just ten minutes and involves one temperature reading and a questionnaire asking them whether they feel unwell.

Officials could make volunteers stay at the airport for 24 hours where their symptoms and temperature would be regularly monitored before they were allowed to leave .

QUARANTINE

Volunteers are allowed to use public transport and carry out daily activities – even though they may develop ebola up to 21 days after treating infected patients.

In certain US states such as Maine and New York, they are placed in quarantine throughout this period – either in a unit next to a hospital or in their own homes. Some have said they felt stigmatised and treated inhumanely when they were only trying to help. The concern is that such strict measures would deter healthcare workers from volunteering.
