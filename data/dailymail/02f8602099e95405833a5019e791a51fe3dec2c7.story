Young couple Erin McFadzen and Erik Clancy thought they were signing a lease to the perfect apartment: a rent-stabilized unit in a newly-constructed high-rise with a porch overlooking the Manhattan skyline.  

Instead, they ended up with a cage. 

These are the bleak wire fences the couple found when they moved into the Q41 apartment in July, which they believe were erected to keep residents in the building paying market value from becoming jealous of their extra space.  

Roped off: Erik Clancy 29 years old and Erin McFadzen 30, behind the so-called 'poor fence' on their Queens apartment

McFadzen and her live-in boyfriend Clancy told the New York Post that they picked the sixth-floor unit because of its wrap-around terrace - but later found they were being separated from the whole balcony

Caged in: Young couple Erin McFazden and Erik Clancy signed a lease on this apartment in Queens, New York for its wraparound porch. But when they moved in, they found this 6-foot wire fence erected, which keeps them from using the full space 

'Poor fences': The couple, who are in a rent-stabilized unit, believe the fence was erected to keep residents paying market value from becoming jealous 

Defense: However, the buildings owners say the fence was installed to cordon off an area where window washers will set up 

Before: What the porch looked like when the couple decided to sign a lease on the building in March 

Residents say the Q41 tower in New York City is fencing in tenants in rent-controlled apartments so they don't get access to the building's huge balcony — and make people paying market-rate jealous 

McFadzen and her live-in boyfriend Clancy told the New York Post that they picked the sixth-floor unit because of its wrap-around terrace.

They checked out the apartment in March when there was no fence — and were outraged to see the barricade there on move-in day in July.

Erin McFadzen and her boyfriend Erik Clancy say they can't get to the terrace due to a 6-foot wire fence

'We’re caged in,' McFadzen, who pays $2,186 for her two-bedroom place, told the Post. 'Every time someone comes over, I have to explain why the fence is there — and tell them we’re rent stabilized, like it’s a badge I have to wear.'

A similar balcony on a market-rate apartment going for $3,692 per month has no wiring, claims the report.

Clancy told the Post he couldn't imagine a prospective market-rate tenant being told: 'You get this beautiful view of Manhattan behind a giant metal fence.'

At least eight units are fenced in, the Post reported. One terrace has been rendered useless with wiring that leaves just a couple of feet of room. 

The 117-unit building's developer, Queensboro Development,  told the couple the fence was necessary so window washers could set up before clean up, according to the Post. 

'It has come to our clients’ attention that you are exceeding your area of usage,' the building's attorney, William Slochowsky, wrote the couple on October 28, according to the Post. 

But a former super told McFadzen and Clancy 'the fence is there to stay' because of market-rate residents with tiny balconies, the newspaper reported. 

The 17-story Q41 building, at 23-10 41st Avenue in Long Island City, had been stalled until the city pumped $7.6 million in subsidies, according to the Post.

Calls to Queensboro Development went unanswered, the newspaper reported.

This is not the first building in New York City to offer separate amenities for rent-controlled and market-rate tenants.

Developer Extell has drawn much criticism for its plan to build a posh tower on Manhattan's Upper West Side using massive tax breaks —  but then make its affordable-housing tenants use a different entrance from high-paying residents

The building's 'poor door' wouldn't be its only difference: under its original plan, some of the higher-paying residents would also have access to different amenities.

Erin McFadzen claims the fence is there so tenants with smaller balconies and who pay market-rate don't get jealous of the amenity she gets for a lower price

Plans for the luxury skyscraper at 1 West End Ave. were slightly altered in August: the building still has separate entrances, but all residents will now have access to such building amenities as a courtyard and river-view roof deck

The affordable segment's lobby will also be stylishly appointed and set facing a park, the developer claims.

Some residents and officials still see the divisions as discriminatory.

Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration has said it aims to bar separate-door schemes.
