A hero reservist saved a British Army colonel by jumping in front of him as he was pelted with bullets in Afghanistan, it has emerged.

The serviceman, an American who normally works for technology giant Apple, acted as a human shield when the colonel came under fire from a rogue Afghan soldier with an assault rifle.

He returned fire with his rifle and pistol, but was shot six times himself as he leapt to defend the senior officer.

Two of the bullets hit him in one of his legs, while one tore into his shoulder and three rounds were stopped by his bulletproof vest.

His amazing act of heroism is believed to have saved the life of the senior British officer, as it is understood he was wearing no body armour.

The soldier works as a customer service manager at the Apple Campus, the company’s headquarters in Cupertino, California.

He had already been on three overseas tours with the US military, including one to Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.

News of the attack emerged at the weekend after the details of an American casualty report were disclosed.

Around 15 soldiers in total were injured in the incident, at a military training complex in Kabul on August 5, although none have been identified.

They included a German brigadier-general, two Afghan generals and two British personnel, but it is not known whether the colonel was one of them.

A US major-general, Harold Greene, was killed — the most senior American soldier to die in combat since the Vietnam War.

The report also reveals that one of Greene’s aides, a 31-year-old captain, is now paralysed below the waist after being shot several times.

It is believed the assailant, Mohammad Rafiqullah, hid in a bathroom with a Nato-issued M16 assault rifle as the group of senior Nato and Afghan officers received a briefing outside.

According to one report, Rafiqullah opened fire about 10 minutes into the delegation’s third briefing in an open area near a military policing unit.

He emptied one magazine before changing to a second in a three-minute attack.

According to witnesses, he fired indiscriminately at the group and did not appear to be targeting any specific person.

At first, it was unclear where the firing was coming from – but then a Nato soldier saw the gunman and killed him with two shots.

The incident was one of the most high-profile ‘green-on-blue’ attacks of conflict.

Nato is due to end combat missions in Afghanistan by the end of the year, with the majority of the remaining 5,000 British troops now involved in the withdrawal operation or in training Afghan troops.

The attack took place at the Marshal Fahim National Defence University, a training complex that includes a British-run army officer academy which is currently training 1,500 cadets.

Rafiqullah, who is believed to have served in the army for at least three years and was in his twenties, came from a district in Paktia province known to harbour fighters from the Haqqani network, which has strong links to the Taliban.

The Ministry of Defence declined to comment on the shooting, as an investigation into the incident is still ongoing.
