Media critic Michael Wolff - who separated from his wife following a 2009 affair - appears to have filed for divorce without telling her.

A docket entry with the Supreme Court of New York in lower Manhattan lists Wolff as the plaintiff in a sealed matrimonial action against his wife, Alison Anthoine.

Anthoine initially told Gawker, who broke the story, that her husband did not file for divorce.

'Well, this is the first time I've heard of it,' Anthoine said after the website offered her proof.

'Neither of us intends to file,' she also said. 'Both of us intend to resolve this amicably.'

Though Anthoine told Gawker she doesn't speak to Wolff much, she did say 'We email, we chat, we are in touch.'

Wolff was kicked out of his home by Anthoine following a 'steamy public affair' with 28-year-oldÂ  Victoria Floethe in 2009, the New York Post reported at the time. That report claimed Wolff and Anthoine were set to begin divorce proceedings.

Thought the Post described Floethe as a Vanity Fair intern, in a 2009 column for The Spectator Floethe claimed she had worked as a low-level researcher for the magazine and that that there was no 'torrid office romance' because Wolff worked from home.

Floethe also denied being a 'femme fatale.'

Wolff, who moved from the Upper East Side to the East Village, denied to Women's Wear Daily in 2009 that he was in the middle of a midlife crisis.

Floethe and Wolff appear to still be involved, based on multiple photos they have uploaded of each other on Instagram.

'Breakfast with the man in #Lanvin,' Floethe captioned a May 3 photograph.

Last week, Wolff himself shared a photo of Floethe with the caption 'Breakfast.'
