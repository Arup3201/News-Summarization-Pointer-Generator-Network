She is nearing closer and closer to the big moment when she steps onstage in front of thousands at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans to perform in the half-time Super Bowl show.

And Beyonce has now posted snaps of her final rehearsals ahead of Sunday's extravaganza on her blog site.

The 31-year-old songstress has been practicing all week, perfecting her (live) singing and dance routines.

It's almost time! Beyonce has posted snaps of her final rehearsals ahead of Sunday's Super Bowl half-time show on her Tumblr blog

The Crazy In Love star has her hair out in her signature tumbling curls and minimal make-up on her complexion.

Beyonce will perform in front of up to 72,000 people in the Mercedes-Benz Superdome.

Millions of people around the world will also tune in to see the half-time show and game.

The new snaps come as Beyonce has been posting several images of her rehearsals all week.

In previous snaps, Beyonce managed to make a long john-style onesie look sensational as she practiced and prepped for the Super Bowl.

And while Beyonce may have appeared as though she had just stepped out of bed, make-up free and her hair in tumbling curls, she looked cute and youthful.

Putting in her all for the practice run, Beyonce showed just what viewers of the famous half-time show are in for when they tune into the sporting event this Sunday.Â 

After her miming controversy at Obama's Inauguration last week, the Crazy In Love star appeared to be singing live as well as exerting her famous dance moves.

Lots of laughs: Beyonce added several pictures of 
herself in rehearsal via her Instagram and Tumblr, including shots of her lying on 
the ground laughing in the same hat

The mother-of-one will be joined by a live band, and could be seen performing alongside a female guitarist.

But it's not just all about Beyonce, the Crazy In Love star also posted pictures of her dance troupe and band, making sure to share the limelight.

As well as Beyonce's personal snaps, a new Super Bowl promo photograph of the singer was released on Tuesday.

When she steps on the stage on Sunday at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans, Beyonce will be hoping to put the recent lip syncing controversy of her Inauguration performance behind her by putting on a dazzling show.

The diva was accused of miming the National Anthem at President Obama's inauguration ceremony, when a spokesman for the Marine Corps Band said she opted for a pre-recorded track of the song instead of singing live.

But hours later, a Marine spokesman 
backed off the claim and insisted he didn't know one way or the other: 
'No one in the Marine Band is in a position to assess whether it was 
live or pre-recorded'.

Meanwhile, Beyonce is already stirring up a frenzy of anticipation for Sunday's show.

But
amid swirling rumours, her Destiny's Child band-mate Michelle Williams 
recently denied that Beyonce would be reuniting with with the band for 
the show.

Michelle, 32, told WRUG Media: 'I'm going to be in the musical Fela! I hate to disappoint the people and tell them that it's not true.'

The singer is headlining a world tour of the Tony Award-winning show, which kicks off Tuesday in Washington, D.C.

But according to the show's website, she will intriguingly not be appearing in the show that day.

'I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry,' Williams said of the reunion rumours. 'But we did record a song with each other before the holidays.'

Destiny's Child - Love Songs, a greatest hits compilation of the group's most romantic recordings will feature a new song, Nuclear - their first in eight years.

However, Michelle did hint that a reunion outside the recording studio may still happen, saying: 'We have talked about it. You know, one day soon.'
