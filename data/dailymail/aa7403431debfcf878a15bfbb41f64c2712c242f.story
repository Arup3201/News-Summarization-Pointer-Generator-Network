Never before seen letters written by hellraising poet Dylan Thomas to the American journalist he had a passionate affair with are to be published for the first time.

Over the course of six letters, the Welsh writer tells Pearl Kazin 'I kiss your heart. I kiss you everywhere' while delighting in a secret liaison behind his wife Caitlin's back.

Thomas' stormy marriage never recovered from the affair, widely considered to be the most passionate and destructive of several he was known to have had before his death from complications relating to alcoholism aged 39 in 1953.

Stormy: Dylan Thomas' marriage never recovered from the affair, considered to be the most passionate of several he was known to have had before his death in 1953 from complications relating to alcoholism

Telling Kazin that he feels so close to her 'that the earth stops, the seas dry up', whenever he thinks of her, the letters provide a unique insight into Thomas' famous affair with the former deputy literary editor of Harper's Bazaar magazine.

To celebrate the 100th anniversary of Thomas' birth, the collection will be published for the first time next month in a book titled 'A Pearl of Great Price' by Jeff Towns.

The first letter sent by Thomas to Kazin was written in April 1950 and sent from the Savage Gentleman's Club, then based in St James', London.

Beginning 'Peal, darling', the letter ends 'I'll sit here drinking Punch and reading sherry until your letter comes. The world is empty this side of the damned sea. I love you, Dylan'. 

His final letter, dated February 1951 and written in Iran while producing a film-script for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, is equally dramatic.

In it Thomas says: 'I am writing this is tasty, stiff-lipped, liverish. British guesthouse in puking Abadan, on the foul blue boiling Persian buggering Gulf'.

Thomas first met Kazin in early 1950 when he visited the offices of Harpar's Bazaar to sell an essay.

Although the affair is believed to have lasted only around a year, it is widely considered have been more passionate and destructive than his relationships with Pamela Glendower and Liz Reitell. 

His long-suffering wife Caitlin, who was portrayed by  Sienna Miller in the 2008 biopic The Edge of Love, is believed to have never forgiven the poet for his affair with Kazin, who he took on a high-profile trip around Europe at the height of their affair.

The letters were given to Dylan Thomas expert Jeff Towns by Kazin's son David after death three years ago.

Tribute: The letters have been released as part of a book marking 100 years since Dylan Thomas' birth

As well as regularly writing about the poet, Towns also ran Dylan's Bookshop in Swansea for nearly 20 years.

There are a number of other tributes to Thomas planned to mark the centenary of his birth, including the Dylan Thomas 100 Festival, of which Prince Charles is Royal Patron.

As part of that event, a replica of Thomas' iconic writing shed, where he penned his famous work Under Milk Wood, will go on tour around the country.

It will be popping up at places and 
events across the country, including the Hay Festival, the Royal Welsh 
Show and the National Eisteddfod.

Visitors
 to the shed will be encouraged to make up a new word which will be 
published in a Dictionary of Dylan - in honour of his love of words.

The
 real writing shed in the picturesque Welsh village of 
Laugharne is a magnet for fans wanting to experience where Thomas found 
his inspiration.

Prince Charles is Royal Patron of the year-long festival and visited Thomas' isolated home on the Taf estuary last summer with his wife the Duchess of Cornwall.

He said after visiting the Carmarthenshire boathouse: 'I think I can begin to understand something of the love of that county which inspired Thomas himself.

'I can only hope that these centenary celebrations will help to spark fresh interest in the genius of one of Wales's greatest poets.'

Thomas lived in the boathouse, which sits below the writing shed, in the four years leading up to his death in New York in 1953.

The first poem Thomas wrote in the shed was Over Sir John's Hill, in which he described the view and wrote of birds stalking their prey and bringing death in the midst of beauty.

Thomas, who was born in Swansea in October 1914 became a popular national figure with his 'play for voices' Under Milk Wood, and stories and radio broadcasts such as 'A Child's Christmas in Wales'.

In his later life he acquired a reputation, which he encouraged, as a 'roistering, drunken and doomed poet'.

Controversy still surrounds the exact cause of his death at the age of 39 in New York in 1953 - whether it was pneumonia or a drink-induced coma during a literary tour.
