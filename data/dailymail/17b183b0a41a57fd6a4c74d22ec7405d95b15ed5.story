When
Tim and Helen MacAndrews bought their idyllic Berkshire home Ruscombe 
Down in 1992, it was a ramshackle shell needing complete renovation.

More
than 20 years later, it has been transformed into a perfect family home
and has all the luxury trappings you would expect in the light of Tim's
successful business career founding the Snappy Snaps photographic 
chain.

The couple estimate they have spent more than £500,000 
renovating the property near Twyford, now on the market for 
£2.95 million.

Back in 1992 this idyllic Berkshire home, Ruscombe Down, needed complete renovation

They moved here from their  two-bedroom flat above 
the Snappy Snaps store in Chiswick, West London. Tim, 58, set up the 
company in 1982 with schoolfriend Don Kennedy. The pair were working 
for  the American franchise print company Kall-Kwik and spotted a gap in
the market for quick photographic printing.

'We learnt a lot about franchising from Kall-Kwik and were looking for a business we could franchise ourselves,' explains Tim.

On
a trip to Canada, Don spotted  a one-hour photo-processing machine 
gathering crowds in a mall. It sparked an idea and the pair invested 
£70,000 in a similar machine sourced from Japan and opened their first 
store, named Snappy Snaps at Tim's suggestion, in Queensway, West 
London.

More stores nearby quickly followed, in Kensington High 
Street, Notting Hill Gate and Gloucester Road. After testing out the 
concept for two years and realising there was a demand for fast 
printing, the pair decided to franchise the business.

By the 1990s they had 155 franchise stores - three of which have been run by Tim's wife Helen over the years.

'That
was our peak - just before the great switchover from analogue to 
digital,' says Tim, who explains that they made sure the business 
survived the shift by diversifying into canvases, posters and printable 
gifts such as mugs and mouse mats.

Last year he and Don sold the 
business to the Timpson shoe repair chain for a reported figure of 
between £2 million and £3 million, although the terms of the sale  mean 
Tim is unable to confirm or deny this figure.

'We had no great plan 
at the beginning - we had no idea what  we were doing at the time,' says
Tim modestly, although the schoolboy friends had shown entrepreneurial 
flair from the time they first met aged 13. 'I always had a paper round 
and I worked at a paying-out booth  at White City dog track when I was 
in my teens,' says Tim, a trained chartered accountant.

The pair also set up a T-shirt printing business while at school, selling customised shirts to their fellow sixth-formers.

They converted the loft to create two extra en suite bedrooms and built a swimming pool and tennis courts

Ruscombe
Down, which is set in eight acres, was built in 1926 by the Godsall 
family from the neighbouring Haines Hill estate. It was for one of their
sons, who had suffered shell shock after the First World War. When the 
MacAndrews bought it, for £500,000, it had been empty for years 
following the deaths of its previous owners. The couple spotted it in an
advert in Country Life magazine and fell in love straight away.

'It 
was the first house we looked at outside London and I don't remember 
viewing any others,' says Tim. 'It was amazing, like a time warp, with 
crazy 1950s wallpaper and a higgledy-piggledy maze of rooms on the 
ground floor,' adds Helen, 53.

As well as rewiring, they knocked 
through the tiny kitchen, and servants' rooms and larders, to create a 
large, open-plan kitchen/diner with an adjoining conservatory and a 
study. The Mark Wilkinson kitchen set them back £80,000. They converted 
the loft to create two extra en suite bedrooms and built a swimming pool
and tennis courts and landscaped the garden.

Now that the couple's 
children  - Ben, 24, Hattie, 23, and Holly, 21 - have all flown the 
nest, the couple  have decided to downsize.

They will divide their 
time between a smaller house in the same area and their  home in Donegal
in north-west Ireland, where Helen grew up.

Tim says: 'It's sad but 
we're being realistic. We don't want a big house falling apart around us
when we're older. At the moment it's in a great state of repair so it 
seemed a good time to sell,' explains Tim.

The recent announcement 
that Crossrail will be extended from Reading to the local station 
Twyford (a brisk five- minute walk from the property) is likely to boost
interest, according  to agent Nicola Craddock of Strutt and Parker.

She adds: 'It can be a sticky market for properties over £2 million because of the seven per cent stamp duty threshold.

'We're
finding strong demand for properties in the £1.5 million to £2 million 
bracket because of this. But the fact that Ruscombe Down is so close to 
the station and commuters can be on a train into Paddington ten minutes 
after leaving their house on foot will make all the difference.'
