She was the barefooted sixties singer who secured Britain’s first ever Eurovision title, so it would be fair to expect her to take centre stage at the contest’s 60th anniversary celebrations.

But Sandie Shaw yesterday claimed she had been snubbed.

The 68-year-old said she was bemused as to why the BBC had not invited her to take part in the Eurovision’s Greatest Hits concert and urged her fans to email the TV show’s executive producer Guy Freeman to ask why.

Sandie Shaw yesterday claimed she had not been invited to Eurovision’s Greatest Hits concert and urged her fans to email the TV show’s executive producer Guy Freeman to ask why

Miss Shaw took Europe by storm in 1967 with her song Puppet on a String, which made her Britain’s first ever Eurovision winner with 47 votes. Since then just four other UK entrants have taken first place in the contest.

But despite her special place in Eurovision history, the singer was not invited to perform and also claimed her offer to help with hosting ‘did not receive a positive response’.

The star took to her Facebook page late on Monday to post: ‘Hi Guy’s I have had a few messages asking why I am not doing the Eurovision 60 years celebration I can’t answer the question so why not ask the man organising it here.’

Miss Shaw’s fans deluged the show’s executive producer with angry emails insisting she be included, until Miss Shaw was forced to remove his contact details from her post.

She then subsequently put up a lengthy post on her page in which she described the matter as a ‘ding dong’ and hinted there may have been doubts over her vocal range. However she insisted she had no problems performing the tune that turned her into a household name, in a lower key.

Miss Shaw said: ‘I have not offered to sing on it. I have not been asked to sing on it. I have had in the recent past no problem singing Puppet.

‘I recently sang it every night for a year on the Jools Holland tour, in a lower key as my vocal range has changed over the years, as it does with every singer. However after the tour I announced my retirement from live singing.

‘I did offer last month as a gesture of support of the 60th celebration to do some hosting which I believe is more appropriate but did not receive a positive response.

‘I do not know why I have not been asked to be involved.’

Miss Shaw’s clash with the BBC and the decision not to include her comes at a time when the broadcaster has faced repeated criticism for failing to properly represent older women in their programming.

But despite her special place in Eurovision history, the singer was not invited to perform and also claimed her offer to help with hosting ‘did not receive a positive response’

In 2012 Mark Thompson, the then Director General of the BBC, admitted there were not enough older women broadcasting on the corporation, especially in ‘iconic roles and on iconic topical programmes.’

Eurovision’s Greatest Hits will be presented by Graham Norton and Swedish comedian and presenter Petra Mede and will be broadcast on BBC One and throughout Europe this Easter. It will kick start celebrations to mark 60 years of the annual music event.

Brotherhood of Man, who won in 1976 with Save Your Kisses for Me, are the only British act billed to perform at the concert. All four members: Martin Lee, Lee Sheriden, Nicky Stevens and Sandra Stevens are now aged 65.

Other performers will include last year’s winner 26-year-old Conchita Wurst, from Austria, Sweden’s Herreys and France’s Natasha St-Pier.

The Eurovision final will take place after the concert on May 23rd and will be hosted in Vienna for the first time since Miss Shaw won there in 1969, making her absence from the concert all the more significant.

Some suggested Miss Shaw may have been excluded because she has previously criticised the singing contest, calling it ‘c**p’.

Last year she told music magazine MOJO: ‘I thought the Eurovision Song Contest was c**p, it wasn’t even on my or my friends’ radar. I’m a post-war baby and the whole idea of countries fighting again seemed ridiculous.’

She also said she hated her winning song, adding: ‘When I got lumbered with singing Puppet On A String I knew there would be a lot of fans who wouldn’t want me doing it.’

Lulu, 66, became the second British winner in 1969 when she came joint first with Spain, Netherlands and with her hit Boom Bang A Bang.

Brotherhood of Man were the first British band to win with Save Your Kisses For Me in 1976, Bucks Fizz, who formed specifically for Eurovision, sang their way to first place with Making Your Mind Up in 1981 and in 1997 Katrina & The Waves became the first British winner in 16 years with Love Shine a Light.

A spokesman for the BBC said: ‘Eurovision’s Greatest Hits is a special event co-produced by the BBC and EBU kick-starting the 60th anniversary of the world’s favourite song contest. The concert has a star-studded line-up of singers containing original acts performing their iconic songs once again.

‘As a 90-minute show, it would be impossible to include all 1400 acts that have entered the contest over the years, this means that difficult decisions have to be made regarding the line-up on the night but we hope that there is something for everyone to enjoy in this special one-off concert that will be broadcast throughout Europe and beyond.’

She is currently married to her third husband Tony Bedford. She has three children.

The singer is now a qualified psychotherapist and runs a clinic in London.
