Guilty: Jamie Cumming stabbed James Getty to death in Dundee

A man dubbed 'Britain’s most feckless father' after fathering 17 children by 15 different mothers is facing life behind bars after he convicted of murdering a man in brutal knife attack. 

Jamie Cumming stabbed James Getty to death outside The Maltman pub in Dundee’s Mains Road - causing 'lethal' injuries to his heart, lungs and liver.

He denied the attack - which took place in front of a string of witnesses - and tried to shift the blame onto a mutual friend of his and Mr Getty’s.

But a jury took just two hours to reject Cumming’s story and convict him of murdering Mr Getty by a majority verdict.

After the verdict was delivered, advocate depute Gillian Wade told the court that Cumming had 19 previous convictions - including one for assault to injury.

And she added: 'The accused is in a relationship and has three children from that union.

'But it is believed he has another 13 children from various other relationships.'

A nine-day trial at the High Court in Dundee heard how Cumming had clashed with Mr Getty in the toilets of The Maltman bar during a mutual friend’s 50th birthday party.

Mr Getty was seen with blood coming from a wound above his eye as he left the toilets - before he followed Cumming outside the pub, where a 'scuffle' broke out.

The fight moved into neighbouring Mid Road, with James Kelbie - who’s 50th birthday the pair had been attending - getting between the pair trying to 'separate' them.

Witnesses told the court they then saw Cumming repeatedly strike Mr Getty in the chest in a 'stabbing motion'.

He was then seen to 'stagger' backwards with a 'stunned' look and blood 'gushing' from his chest.

Mr Getty walked back into Mains Road 
before collapsing, with Mr Kelbie trying to put pressure on his wounds 
as an ambulance rushed to the scene.

The
court heard that Mr Getty suffered 'lethal' stab wounds to his heart, 
lungs and liver - and 'would have died even if he had been stabbed in 
the hospital car park', according to a medical examiner.He died around an hour and a half after the attack at Dundee’s Ninewells Hospital.

Meanwhile, Cumming fled, jumping into
a taxi and making his way to meet notorious Dundee underworld figure 
George Kerr - who has links to Glasgow gangster Paul Ferris.

Kerr
later burned Cumming’s blood spattered t-shirt, and told the court he 
drove Cumming around various streets in Dundee while Cumming sat with a 
snake around his neck.

Cumming
sent a string of texts to former partners in the minutes after the 
attack - telling Chelsea Anderson, 21, the mother of his 16th child, who
was born in November 2011, that 'it wasnae for nothing'.

He told another that he had 'done someone'.

Cumming was arrested the following day, on June 2 last year, in his grandfather’s car - with a bag containing his bloodstained shoes and clothes.

He told cops 'I’ve thrown my life away' as they took him to Tayside Police HQ in Dundee city centre.

A forensic examination of his clothes found Mr Getty’s blood inside the pockets of his jeans and inside his shirt.

Cumming, 36, a prisoner at HMP Perth, denied that he had murdered James Getty by repeatedly striking him on the body with a knife or similar instrument.

Cumming has lodged a special defence of incrimination on the murder charge, alleging that James Kelbie committed the crime.

But a jury of eight men and seven women took just over two hours to find him guilty of murder by majority.

Donald Findlay QC, defending, said he would reserve his plea in mitigation until a later sentencing date.

Judge Lady Clark of Calton said Cumming faces a life sentence when he appears at the High Court in Edinburgh on April 3.

She said: 'The penalty for murder is of course prescribed by law.

'But I require a report before I can sentence.'

Cumming showed no emotion as the verdict was read - but bowed his head as he was led in handcuffs to the cells.

No-one from either family made any comment as they left the court.

Jamie Cumming was first branded 'Britain’s most feckless father' in late 2011 after it emerged he had fathered 16 children by 14 different mothers.

But now he will miss the younger years of all those children as he faces life in prison over the murder of James Getty outside the Maltman pub in Dundee on June 1 last year.

Cumming’s profligate procreation came to light when his mother, Lorraine, launched a scathing attack on his bedhopping antics.

She said: 'We don’t speak to each other, and, even though I love him as my child, I am bitterly disappointed with how he lives his life.

'It’s difficult to keep up with it all, but I do my best to see all the kids.

'He just doesn’t seem bothered, even though he thinks he’s "Father of the Year" because he lives with three of them.

'It’s sad he doesn’t see his eldest who I have looked after since she was born.

'The girls he is running around with just now are not much older than her - he just loves teenagers.'I would say he is a sexual predator.'

Cumming was just 17 when his first daughter was born in 1995, but once the baby arrived he moved his affections to the mum's cousin.

The baby was left with Cumming’s parents to raise as their own, and the daughter has seen her own mother only twice since.

Between 1997 and 2002, Cumming then fathered another five children with five different mothers.

In 2004, he had two girls and a boy who were all born within months of each other, and between December 2007 and August 2008 the former barman fathered three more offspring.

The only woman Cumming has had more than one child with is an on-off girlfriend - they have three children together.

She gave birth to his 14th child in July 2010, and he became a father for the 15th time in November 2011 when a teenager he had a brief fling with gave birth to a baby boy.

Chelsea Anderson, 21, had his 16th child later that month. She gave evidence against him during his murder trial, telling the court he had written to her: 'It wasnae for nothing - I was in a mood and he was being a prick.'

And his 17th was born in early 2012 to another teenage mum, who has not been identified.

Cumming defended his behaviour - claiming he was following the Bible commandment to 'go forth and multiply'.

He said: 'I’ve sat in loads of bars over the years and heard people moaning about the population falling in Dundee. 

'I’ve been doing my best to repopulate the town.

'I’ve done my bit, but I know that on Judgement Day, I might pay for my sins.'

Cumming added: 'Contraception is a two-way thing. If women are going to have sex with me and don’t want a baby, why don’t they take the Pill?

'I’m a big boy, 6ft 4in, well-built and I’m in proportion.

'I know they’re supposed to make condoms for larger men these days, but I’ve not found one yet.

'The reality is all these women have been happy to have my babies.

'Maybe some of them thought I was a good catch. Others believed I’d settle down with them.

'I never promised them anything.'
