A 30-year-old man who allegedly groomed a teenager online with promises that he would marry her has been caught after the 15-year-old girl's parents set up a Facebook sting.

After the family of the Spokane girl discovered she had been meeting a man she met on Facebook, her mother posed as her daughter online and arranged a meeting.

When Jason Richards arrived at the family home in Spokane, Washington, in the early hours of June 8, the girl's father and his friends were waiting for him.

Richards, of Federal Way, Washington, is now facing charges of child rape and attempted kidnapping.

The alleged relationship with the underage girl began in April, through the Facebook app Are You Interested?

The 30-year-old had exchanged hundreds of messages with the teenager and, despite knowing her age, arranged to meet at a hotel twice in May, where he had sex with her.

The coffee distributor gave the girl an engagement ring and discussed running away with the girl to western Washington, where they would change her name and appearance, according to the Spokane Review.

'I think it's important to understand 
that you're dealing with a very manipulative suspect and so they're 
going to hone in on whatever it is that that victim needs in order to 
get closer to them,' Sergeant Justin Lundgren, of Spokane Police, said.

The alleged abuser had boasted of his engagement on his Facebook page, but did not identify his fiancee.

Richards allegedly bought the girl a cell phone and she agreed to delete her Facebook account so her parents would not be able to find her.

'He was very patient and, like I said, it was a very slow developing relationship over time and ultimately ending in the abuse situation,' Sergeant Lundgren, told KXLY.

When the parents of the girl, who has not been identified, found out about the relationship on June 7 they confiscated her iPad and took over her Facebook account.

In messages sent from the mother, posing as her daughter, Richards was told to come to the house that night so they could run away.

But when he arrived at the family home at about 3am on June 8, he was confronted by the girl's father and his friends who had been hiding in an alley.

The group blocked his escape route and detained Richards until police arrived and arrested him.

'The suspect believed he was communicating with the victim online and as such felt comfortable going to contact her again and as a result we were able to arrest him at that time,' Sergeant Lundgren said.

Richards initially told investigators he believed the girl was 18, but a review his chat history showed he knew she was 15 before their sexual relationship began, according to SWX.

His bond was set at $100,000 by Superior Court Judge James Triplet last week.
