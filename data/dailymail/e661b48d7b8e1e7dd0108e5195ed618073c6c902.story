Former Australian politician Pauline Hanson

Another Australian public figure has come forward to say that she is 'offended' by Muslim headscarves, just days after Prime Minister Tony Abbott publicly branded the burqa as 'confronting'.

Pauline Hanson - who once made headlines when she warned that Australia was in danger of becoming 'swamped by Asians' - has spoken out in support of the burqa ban, saying that 'people wearing full face coverings, including women, are known to have hidden bombs underneath'.

'I'm offended by the burqa, and opposed to even the niqab,' she declared in an opinion piece published by The Courier Mail on Saturday.

This follows Prime Minister Tony Abbott's announcement that he found the burqa 'confronting' on Wednesday while Palmer United Party Senator Jacqui Lambie continues to call for burqas to be banned.

Ms Hanson showed her support for Ms Lambie, saying that she speaks for many Australians.

The former leader of the One Nation Party agrees that no one should wear headscarves in parliament, banks or public place for security reasons and says she feels bad for the women who she believes are obligated to wear such garments.

Ms Hanson says it is her understanding that every terrorist attack has been by Muslims and states wearing the headscarves create fear and is 'not the Australian way of life'.

The former politician says Muslim women should abide by the Australian law and further urged the government to take a stance.

Her controversial views are well in line with Ms Lambie's, after the outspoken senator clashed on live TV with a Muslim woman as she continued to call for burqas to be banned.

In a spirited debate on the Seven's Sunrise program, Palmer United Party Senator Ms Lambie said the debate was a 'national security issue' because people needed to be identifiable.

But Muslim Women's Association executive officer Maha Abdo, who wears a hijab, laughed off her comments, insisting someone wearing a burqa is not a threat.

Ms Abdo insisted Muslim women were allowed to lift their veil to show their faces to authorities.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott says he finds the burqa 'confronting' and wishes 'it was not worn'

The senator also praised Prime Minister Tony Abbott for his 'courage' and 'strength' in publicly branding the burqa 'confronting' on Wednesday.

'I've said before that I find it a fairly confronting form of attire, and frankly I wish it was not worn,' Mr Abbott told reporters.

'But we are a free country and a free society and it's not the business of government to tell people what they should and should not wear.'

For a brief moment on Thursday, there was even a plan to keep Muslim visitors who wanted to watch proceedings at Parliament House in a glass enclosure.

The plan was quashed late last night by Prime Minister Tony Abbott, following community uproar and backlash from members of his own party. 

Last month, Ms Lambie re-posted a meme of a woman wearing a burqa holding a gun which was captioned: 'For security reasons it is time to ban the burqa'.

Ms Hanson became the centre of a racist storm following a maiden speech to the House of Representatives in 1996 where she voiced her opposition to immigration and multiculturalism, while also claiming that Australia was 'in danger of becoming swamped by Asians'.
