Eoin Morgan has promised to ‘do it my way’ as he takes charge of England in Sunday’s fourth one-day international against Sri Lanka.

With Alastair Cook suspended after presiding over a slow over-rate during Wednesday’s win in Hambantota, Morgan has the chance to lead his adopted country to an unlikely series-levelling victory.

And Morgan, who is without a half-century in his last 15 one-day innings, backed himself to end a slump that has prompted Kevin Pietersen to blame what he views as the relentless coaching of Peter Moores — or, as KP referred to him in a recent tweet, the ‘woodpecker’.

Morgan prefers to put his mediocre form down to two factors: a loss of focus on his own game during the first half of the summer against the Sri Lankans and the excellence of India’s one-day bowling.

He said: ‘With the turnaround in all the backroom staff at the start of the summer, and guys having different inputs, as a senior player you want to be involved as much as you can. I probably neglected my side of the game. I’d spent a lot of energy off the field.’

Now, he is hoping the captaincy will act as a catalyst, as Moores put it on Thursday.

Morgan, pointing out that it wasn’t in his nature to fret, added: ‘In the fashion that I play, I don’t think I can, simply because I have to play an aggressive type of game.

‘It’s the way I’ve played since I was a kid and it works for me.

‘So there’s no use going into my shell or not playing any more shots. I’m a gambler and I’d say I’m due to get a score. I’ve got to stay true to myself.’ The good news for England is that he has an impressive record with the bat while leading the side. 

In seven one-dayers as captain he has scored 365 runs at 73 — roughly twice his career average. ‘I’ve always enjoyed captaining,’ he said. ‘Having not been a bowler since I was about 17, it gives you another string to your bow.

‘It also takes a bit of attention away from your batting so maybe it will contribute to me getting some runs.’

Before Wednesday’s five-wicket win, any talk of England winning the series would have been greeted with incredulity.

But Morgan said: ‘You can see the belief in the guys’ eyes. They gained a lot of confidence from the other night.’

The slot in the line-up opened up by Cook’s absence could go to Nottinghamshire’s middle-order batsman James Taylor, the only member of the 15-man squad yet to get a game here.

Off-spinner James Tredwell is likely to return after being left out at Hambantota. Ben Stokes, who has looked out of sorts, could make way.

There is genuine excitement at the prospect of Moeen Ali — the star of the tour so far — opening the batting with Alex Hales.

Morgan’s one-game ascent to the captaincy may not have come at the worst time.
