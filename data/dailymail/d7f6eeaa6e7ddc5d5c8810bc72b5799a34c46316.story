British women are dying earlier than some of their counterparts in other European countries including Portugal, Greece and Slovenia, a report has warned.

A woman living in the UK will have an average life expectancy that is two years shorter than women in France, Spain and Italy – as well as a year shorter than the average in Cyprus, Malta or Andorra.

Female obesity levels in Britain are also the worst in Europe, with 23 per cent of women considered too fat, double the continent’s average.

And the study revealed that the death rates in Britain for children under five are higher than in most neighbouring countries, with even comparably poor states such as the Czech Republic and Estonia faring better.

Britain was ranked 21st out of 28 countries who could provide figures for death rates in the under-fives, only coming ahead of former Eastern bloc countries.

The World Health Organisation and 
academics from University College London compiled the report which, for 
the first time, provides a detailed comparison between the overall 
health levels in more than 50 countries in Europe.

It shows Britain ranks 21st out of 53 for female life expectancy rates – just behind Greece, Slovenia and Portugal.

On average British women live to the age of 83 compared to 85 in Spain, France and Italy.

But for men, the figures are considerably better, with the nation placed 11th.

Men in Britain live to an average age of 78 compared to 80 in Israel  and Iceland, which have the  joint highest life expectancies.

Professor Michael Marmot, from University College London, said: ‘We are failing too many of our children, women and young people on a grand scale.

‘I
 would say to any government that cares about the health of its 
population – look at the impact that their policies have on the lives 
people are able to lead and, more importantly, at the impact on 
inequality.’

Professor 
Marmot, who chaired the report, said he believes the country’s failure 
to tackle rising obesity levels is partly to blame for the disappointing
 figures.

He said: ‘For 
obesity, particularly female obesity, we are absolutely dreadful. It’s 
dramatic and appalling that we have such high levels of obesity. We 
really are storing up big problems there. We are doing very badly.’

He added: ‘Why we eat so unhealthily is a much more broader and complex question.

‘We think there are things we can do to change that but we’ve not done very much so far.’

He
 also warned that youngsters who are not working or studying are 
‘storing up a public health timebomb’ – as they tend to have worse 
lifestyle habits and suffer from higher levels of depression and 
suicide.

They will also have
 far lower incomes, meaning their children will be more likely to live 
in poverty and be unhealthier, he said.

And
 he described unemployment in this age group as ‘very worrying’ adding 
that the impact it would have on their own  children’s health will be 
‘tragic’.

Public health minister Jane Ellison said: ‘This report underlines the stubborn nature of health inequalities across Europe.

‘It
 reinforces the message that people’s health is shaped by the conditions
 in which they live, work and age – and that action is needed to improve
 them.’
