The wife of a millionaire businessman cut her own throat and bled to death in the couple’s kitchen after he went on a golf holiday.

Eight days before, Bernadette Mc-Conchie, 57, had taken an overdose of prescription drugs while her husband, former Tesco director Neil Mc- Conchie, was in Portugal on the trip.

The retired primary school teacher told doctors she wanted to harm herself because she was upset about her husband going away..

Tragic: Bernadette McConchie had a history of depression and had attempted suicide when her husband Neil had gone on a golf holiday to Portugal

Mr McConchie, 59, flew back home the day after her overdose, and she was discharged from hospital.

Death: Bernadette McConchie's blood-covered body was found by her husband

A week later he found his wife’s body 
covered in blood on the kitchen floor of the £700,000 house they shared 
in the village of Milton Malsor, Northamptonshire.

The couple’s first grandchild had been born only days previously.

At the inquest into her death, Mr 
McConchie paid tribute to his ‘irreplaceable’ wife of 35 years.

He added that while for ‘95 per cent of the time’, Mrs McConchie was ‘happy, bubbly and outgoing’, she had also suffered with depression and had tried to kill herself once before.

The inquest, held yesterday, heard how Mrs McConchie took an overdose at a dinner party she was hosting on April 24 this year, two days after her husband left for Portugal.

Friends called an ambulance  after she began drifting in and out of consciousness.

A GP’s report read to the inquest stated: ‘She said she took the overdose because she did not want her husband to go off on a golf week.’

Mr McConchie told the inquest his wife was ‘agitated’ after he returned, and became increasingly withdrawn from family and friends.

On May 2, the couple had a late lunch at home before Mrs McConchie took a cup of coffee upstairs with her to watch television.

‘At around 4.30pm I received a phone call from her sister, Margaret, in Ireland,’ Mr McConchie said.

‘I went to find Bernie but she wasn’t where I expected.

She was lying on the kitchen floor covered in blood.

She had cut her throat badly. I called 999 and tried CPR until the ambulance arrived.’

Terrible: Mrs McConchie was found dead in the kitchen of her Northamptonshire home by her husband

Profession: 57-year-old Bernadette McConchie used to teach at Collingtree Primary School before her death

Mr McConchie, managing director of a 
warehousing and distribution firm he founded, attended the hearing with 
the couple’s children Maria, 32, and Connor, 30.

Paying tribute to his wife, he said: 
‘As a mother, grandmother and wife she will be sorely missed and loved 
forever. She was simply irreplaceable.’

Northamptonshire deputy coroner Rodney Haig recorded a verdict of suicide.
