Chief Operating Officer of the UK business division of Tesco, Noel Robbins, sold off shares days before value plunged

A senior Tesco executive sold shares just over a week before a profit warning sent their value plunging.

Noel ‘Bob’ Robbins, the supermarket chain’s UK chief operating officer, sold 50,000 shares at 404p on January 4, netting around £202,000.

Had he sold at yesterday’s much lower closing price, he would have been more than £40,000 worse off.

His sell-off came eight days before Tesco reported its biggest drop in sales for decades – triggering a 16 per cent fall in its share price.

It was also just three days before the end of the period covered by its trading statement.   

UK listing rules say directors should not buy or sell shares in their company while in possession of unpublished, price-sensitive information.

The regulations, policed by the Financial Services Authority, also require directors and senior managers to obtain board-level approval before selling shares and forbid trading in shares during so-called close periods between the end of a financial period and the reporting of results.

One shareholder watchdog described the sale as troubling. ‘It doesn’t look very good, especially in this case, when you are head of UK operations,’ said Simon Wong, of corporate governance watchdog Governance4Owners.

Tesco insisted it and Mr Robbins had operated within the rules.

‘Bob Robbins sold less than 5 per cent of his substantial shareholding in Tesco for necessary family expenditure,’ a spokesman said.

‘We are confident that Bob was not in possession of any price-sensitive information at the time the sale was approved.’

Mr Wong said however that operating within the letter of the law was not enough: ‘If these companies say it’s still within the rules, then I think the rules may need to change, because this is a concern and it damages confidence.’

The FSA says its listing rules are designed not only to avoid abuse but also to ensure that the right thing is seen to be done.

Companies are given the freedom to impose even stricter guidelines should they deem it necessary.

Under Tesco’s rules, directors were barred from trading company shares from January 7 to January 12.

Other retailers opted for much longer close periods ahead of their key Christmas trading updates. Those of Marks & Spencer and J Sainsbury, for example, both ran for about four weeks.

The importance of keeping to the spirit, as well as the letter, of rules on personal dealings was highlighted last week when Swiss National Bank chairman Philipp Hildebrand resigned, saying he could not prove he had been unaware of a currency trade made by his wife.

A Tesco veteran, Mr Robbins was appointed UK chief operating officer on March 1 last year, having previously worked as chief executive officer for central and eastern Europe and strategy and development director in Asia.

The 54-year-old sits on the group’s executive committee, one level below its main board.

Another executive, Ken Towle, sold nearly £155,000 of shares shortly before Christmas. The head of Tesco’s online arm would have been £28,000 worse off had he held on until yesterday, when the shares closed at 316p.

With its profit warning, Tesco said underlying takings fell by 2.3 per cent at Christmas, the most crucial trading period of the year.

A flagship promotion, called the Big Price Drop, failed to bring in enough shoppers, while bosses admitted that a decision to cut back on vouchers and meal deals was wrong.

Tesco’s share of the Christmas grocery market dipped below 30 per cent for the first time in six years. One City analyst said it was the ‘nightmare scenario’.
