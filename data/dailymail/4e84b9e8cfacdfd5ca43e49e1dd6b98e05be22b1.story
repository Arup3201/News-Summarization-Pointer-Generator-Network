Instagram crashed this morning, causing uproar on Twitter where Instagrammers have fled to lament their undocumented meals, facial expressions and carefully curated outfits.

The Twitterverse pondered whether it was a glut of Coachella selfies that overwhelmed the site and caused the breakdown.

Others were concerned about starvation afflicting those with am inability to eat a meal without taking a photograph and posting it to Instagram.

Panic overtook social media addicts when
 the site went down around 9:30 this morning, with many posting 
tongue-in-cheek comments about the selfie-snapping Coachella crowd.

David Spade wrote, 'Instagram is down. Does that mean they cancel Coachella? I mean what's the point of going now. To hear music??'

'Instagram is down. Oh no! Where are attractive people going to get their validation from?' tweeted comedian Jason Downs.

Charles Thorp ‏wrote: 'Tragic News: @Instagram down, people at #Coachella forced to enjoy music.'

A tweet from the Instagram account confirms the site is down, but not the cause of the problem.

'We’re working to fix a feed delivery issue. Thank you for your patience,' read the tweet.

When Instagram went down,  when users attempted to load a photo on a desktop computer, they received a '504 Gateway Time-out.'

When users tried to load the homepage, you were given a screen with, 'Sorry, we couldn't complete your request. Our team has been notified and will investigate as soon as possible' on it.

As of about 2pm, the site was back up and running, and it's now flooded with selfies taken with filters at Coachella. Normalcy has been restored.
