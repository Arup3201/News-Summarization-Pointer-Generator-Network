Cesar Azpilicueta has been in such impressive form this season that Chelsea TV found it fitting to name him twice in the starting line-up - at the expense of Branislav Ivanovic.

The comical error was spotted while the television channel was going through Chelsea's starting line-up ahead of their game with Everton.

The Spanish international was pictured in both full back positions and even by his standards - it would be difficult to play both at the same time.

Ivanovic, whose been one of the league leaders most consistent performers, will certainly disagree with their choice of starting line up.  

Jose Mourinho is unlikely to name the same line up as Chelsea TV's but he has given new signing Juan Cuadrado is first start.

Loic Remy also got the nod ahead of Didier Drogba as he looks to continue his fine record of scoring three goals in just seven shots.
