The Duchess of Cambridge said today that she hopes her baby is a boy.

But Kate, who is five months pregnant, said Prince William would prefer to have a girl.

The Duchess made the revelations while speaking to a soldier during the couple's visit to Mons Barracks in Aldershot, Hampshire, for a St Patrick's Day parade.

Girl or a boy? Kate told a soldier during a St Patrick's Day parade that she is hoping to have a son, while Prince William wants a daughter

After the parade the couple chatted to soldiers from the 1st Battalion Irish Guards.

Guardsman Lee Wheeler, 29, said: 'I was talking to her about the baby, of course.

'I asked her "do you know if it’s a girl or boy", and she said "not yet".

'She said "I’d like to have a boy and William would like a girl". That’s always the way.

'I asked her if she had any names yet and she said no.

'I said I suppose you’ve got to stick to traditional names.'

Guardsman Jason Perry, 33, also spoke to the Duchess about her pregnancy.

He said: 'I wished her congratulations and said I hoped everything is fine. She said "yes it is".

'I asked her if she was excited to be having her first child. She said "very".'

The soldier said it was 'absolutely 
brilliant' to meet the couple and they had both asked him about his 
13-and-a-half year career in the Army, which has seen him serve two 
tours of Iraq and one in Northern Ireland.

William, who wore the ceremonial dress
of the Irish Guards, sipped on a glass of sherry inside the dining hall
at the Guardsmens' cookhouse, while the pregnant Duchess went without a drink.

The pair were loudly cheered by the 
soldiers as they entered the hall, which gave them welcome shelter from 
the heavy rain outside.

Last month, speculation on the sex of the baby went into overdrive when the Duchess appeared to suggest the couple were having a girl.

Before going inside, the Duke and Duchess had put on a brave face as they posed for formal photographs with officers and sergeants in the torrential rain.

The wet weather had earlier held off as the royal couple watched the parade take place under the cover of a podium.

Under grey skies, the Duchess took her position next to the Duke, who was attending the event as Colonel of the Regiment and for the first time wore an insignia aide de camp to the Queen on his shoulder, which was bestowed on him today.

The couple looked on as about 200 
soldiers paraded through the puddle-strewn square, bringing a splash of 
colour to the occasion in their full ceremonial uniform of scarlet 
tunics and bearskins, and led by the Band of the Irish Guards.

Kate, who had her hair up, wore an elegant black hat with a felt flower and a patriotic green coat to mark St Patrick's Day.

She finished off her outfit with black tights and heels.

The Duke watched as she presented traditional sprigs of shamrock to the officers and guardsmen, including one to himself.

Many of the soldiers who received the sprigs wore them in the front of their caps, as did the Duke, while Kate attached one to her lapel, next to a shamrock brooch.

The last sprig was given to the regiment’s new mascot, seven-month-old Irish wolfhound Domhnall, who was carrying out his first public engagement.
