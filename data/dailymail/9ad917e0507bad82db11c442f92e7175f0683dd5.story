An elderly Australian couple who won a dream holiday trip to Canada were stunned when they returned home to find their suitcases contained more than £4 million worth of drugs.

While in Canada on a trip that had been awarded by a seemingly genuine travel company the pensioners were given new suitcases as part of their prize - unaware that the bags contained a total of 7kg of methamphetamine in rock form that had been loaded by a drug-running syndicate.

Police in Australia said today that the elaborate scam was being operated by a bogus Canadian-based travel company whose website targeted elderly Australian couples, offering them the chance to win an all-expenses trip across the Pacific.

Bags of meth: After their week-long holiday the man, aged 72, and his 64-year-old wife became concerned about their new bags when they arrived back at the airport in Perth. The bags were opened - and it was then that 3.5kg of the drugs were found in each suitcase

The Australian pensioners who were the 'lucky winners' of a competition were sent two tickets to Canada, awarded with seven nights accommodation and were even told they would be provided with new suitcases.

After their week-long holiday the man, aged 72, and his 64-year-old wife became concerned about their new bags when they arrived back at the airport in Perth, where they live, and reported their worries to Customs officials.

Intercepted: A policeman holds up the drugs for the media. Police said investigations had revealed a complex and highly organised scam in which older Australians are being targeted

The bags were opened - and it was then that 3.5kg of the drugs were found in each suitcase.

Australian Federal Police said today 
that it will be alleged in court that the couple's original luggage was 
exchanged in Canada for new bags and that they had no idea as they 
boarded their flight home that they had become unwitting mules.

But by the time they arrived in Perth they had become concerned for reasons that have not been disclosed.

Police said they were due to be met on arrival, resulting in a 38-year-old Canadian man being arrested at the airport.

His
arrest led to a raid on a hotel room in the Perth seaside suburb of 
Scarborough where officers found documents relating to the scam, along 
with more bags similar to the ones that had been seized.

The Canadian was charged with importing a commercial quantity of a border-controlled drug.

Commander
David Bachi, of the Australian Federal Police based at Perth airport, 
said investigations had revealed a complex and highly organised scam in 
which older Australians are being targeted by a bogus Canadian-based 
tour company identifying itself as AUSCAN Tours.

He said the organisers had gone to great lengths to provide a facade of legitimacy.

'Thankfully,
these travellers contacted Customs and didn't dismiss their concerns, 
allowing us to make the arrest,' said Commander Bachi.

He
said Australian police would continue working with local and 
international law enforcement agencies, targeting 'all elements of this 
drug syndicate.'
