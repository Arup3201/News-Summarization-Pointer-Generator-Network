An award-winning food firm has been slapped with £18,000 legal costs after it was caught cooking meals for primary children in shocking conditions.

Environmental health officers visited Food 4 Thought GB Ltd’s premises in Boston, Lincolnshire, on October 4 last year after a tip off from a concerned school.

And they were stunned when they found filthy conditions in the unit where children’s meals were being prepared.

As well as mould-stained chopping boards, council officers found dirty cups, plastic bowls and colanders.

The filthy premises also had grimy floors, walls and cleaning cloths as well as flaking paint and inadequate food labelling.

Health bosses also discovered raw meat being stored next to cooked ready-to-eat ham.

Food 4 Thought GB Ltd admitted 12 different food hygiene charges when company directors Caroline Clark and Moira Clark appeared at Boston Magistrates Court on Monday.

The company, which supplied 750,000 meals-a-year to 75 schools in Lincolnshire, was fined £13,800 and ordered to pay £4,300 costs as well as a victim surcharge of £130.

Magistrates said they were surprised that someone with even a basic knowledge of food hygiene had not identified issues before the visit.

After the case councillor Malcolm Chandler, South Holland District Council’s portfolio holder for environmental health, said: 'Officers from our food, health and safety team take seriously their responsibilities in protecting the public and ensuring good standards of food hygiene are maintained.

'We work very closely with businesses to raise and maintain standards. We work in partnership with neighbouring authorities and agencies to ensure that geographical boundaries are not an obstacle.'

He added: 'The business in question supplies a number of school meals within South Holland District Council’s area and I believe the public, and in particular parents, will be assured by the action taken.'

Food 4 Thought GB Ltd - which has eight sites across Lincolnshire - has operated as a school meals supplier since 2006 having previously been called Hungry Monkeys UK Ltd.

The company displays a Lincolnshire Small and Medium Business of the Year award on the wall of its new offices in Spalding, Lincolnshire, and won ‘Contribution to the Community’ award in Boston last year.

After the case Mrs Clark admitted their standards had slipped but insisted it was a 'one-off'.

She added: 'We remain committed to food hygiene in our operation, as our case mentioned we admitted that at the time standards did fall below those which we and the local authority endeavour to keep to only the highest levels.'

'We would like to reassure our customers that the findings are not of recent visits to the site, but a single one-off historic visit.

Magistrates said they were surprised that someone with even a basic knowledge of food hygiene had not identified issues before the visit

'Upon receiving the report, for which this prosecution started from, some six months ago, we immediately re-recruited our management team and gave further training to the area manager.

'We are confident that following our senior management actions, the site immediately reverted to the highest of standards, as evidenced in our last official star rating of 5/5.

'However, we have also requested another visit from the district, as soon as possible, so that following the court hearing, we can again evidence our commitment to food hygiene.'

On their website Food 4 Thought GB Ltd described themselves as 'Lincolnshire’s fastest growing provider of school meals, supplying thousands of healthy school meals each week'.

They add: 'Here you will see how our award winning company succeeds in increasing take up of school lunches, by providing only the best quality, freshly prepared, child friendly meals.

'As specialists in the education sector, we devote all of our efforts into ensuring our customers, children, parents and schools, are happy with the service we provide, and have evidenced a whopping 300 per cent increase in take up since the introduction of our services in our flagship schools.'
