Bentley is on course for its most successful year in its 95-year history thanks to soaring sales in China and the Middle East.

The luxury car maker, based in Crewe, Cheshire, delivered 5,254 cars worldwide in the first six months of this year – a 23 per cent rise on the same period in 2013 when it shipped 4,279.

The upsurge was driven by the release of the Continental GT V8 S coupe and convertible, new Flying Spur and Flying Spur V8.

Although its UK sales increased by only 2 per cent (with 713 new cars delivered in comparison to 698 in 2013), Bentley delivered 61 per cent more cars to China (up to 1318 cars in 2014) and 27 per cent more in the Middle East.

European deliveries rose 11 per cent on the back of a strong performance in Germany.

The Americas region, which includes North, Central and South America as well as the Caribbean, remains Bentley’s No 1 market, with 1,388 cars delivered so far this year – an 8 per cent increase.Kevin Rose, Bentley's sales, marketing and aftersales chief, said: ‘We continue to prove we are the world's most sought-after luxury car brand.

‘It's vital to continuously develop in our exclusive market, as our customers are the most discerning. There is no question that some markets will remain tough but we are confident of a good 2014.’

The figures follow record half-year sales for Rolls-Royce and BMW.
