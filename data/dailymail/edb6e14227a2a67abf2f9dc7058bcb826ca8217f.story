Spare a thought for those trying to live on £100,000 to £370,000 a year – it is, apparently, just not enough.

Once they have clawed their way into the top one per cent of earners, they soon find themselves struggling to keep up with those making even more.

Dubbed the ‘squeezed upper middle’, they don’t find it easy to maintain their six-figure lifestyles. Although they might earn up to 14 times more than the average worker, they still complain of feeling the pinch.

The 'squeezed upper middle' class are struggling  to live on £100,000 to £370,000 a year

That’s because the gulf between them and the super-rich at the very top of the one per cent bracket is so great. 

Soon, as their vast incomes are gobbled up on private education for their children and big properties, they become resentful and envious of those with even more wealth. 

Those who make up the top half per cent above them, with salaries that can run into the millions, include bankers and footballers.

Danny Dorling, a geography professor at Oxford University, describes the trend in his book Inequality and the 1 per cent. He said the have-lots were particularly common in London, where so many of the super-rich live.

‘It would be very hard to find someone in London with a household income of between £200,000 and £350,000 who told you they felt comfortable, and that is remarkable,’ he told the Sunday Times.

As a couple with two children, you need to earn £200,000 to be classed in the top one per cent

He said those in this bracket often mistakenly regarded themselves as the ‘squeezed middle’, even though with the average UK income at just under £27,000, they are somewhat beyond the middle. The average for the top one per cent of earners is £369,000.

The squeezed upper middle includes senior managers, lawyers, accountants, BBC executives, hospital consultants and university vice-chancellors.

To be in this group, a single person has to earn at least £100,000, a childless couple £160,000 and a couple with two children £200,000.

Professor Dorling says those in this group are likely to begrudge paying for other people’s education through their taxes, while shelling out for their own family privately.

Peter York, a social commentator and co-founder of the management consultancy SRU, said: ‘People who are doing very well consider themselves hard done by, as in London and the South-East they are squeezed out of the places they want to live, squeezed into private services they can’t afford and psychologically squeezed by the presence nearby of the luxury life.’

The upper middles have an ‘unrealistic vision of the world’, according to Mr York, because they constantly compare themselves with the super-rich.

Calculations by the Institute for Fiscal Studies show members of the squeezed upper middle have enjoyed earnings growth of 118 per cent in the past 25 years.

Yet the price of status purchases has risen faster: a four-bedroom property in central London has gone up by 523 per cent, for example, and private day-school fees by 461 per cent.

However, there is little public sympathy for high earners who claim to be struggling.

Foreign and Commonwealth Office minister Mark Simmonds faced criticism when he resigned last month, saying he and his wife could not afford a family life on a joint income and expenses of about £140,000.

Another top earner decided to swap careers when he realised that as long as he was paying the top rate of tax there would be little money left after school fees for three children. 

Divyang Mistry, 50, earned £200,000 as a director of a corporate communications firm, but still had to borrow money from his father to buy a family home in Hertfordshire. 

He decided to change job and set up two online companies, which meant he could keep more for his family by paying less tax.
