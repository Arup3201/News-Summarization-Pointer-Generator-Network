The trial of a terror suspect accused of planning a series of attacks in the Tampa Bay Area of Florida resumed today with prosecutors showing footage of what they say is the suspect purchasing weapons from an undercover agent and explaining his plans for a bloodbath at the Hard Rock Casino along with other populated Florida hotspots.

Sami Osmakac, 25, a naturalized American citizen born in Kosovo, then part of the former Yugoslavia in eastern Europe was arrested in January 2012 after allegedly buying explosive devices and firearms from an undercover FBI agent who was privately filming the interaction from various hidden cameras.

One video shown in court today shows footage of what police say is Osmakac and an undercover police officer going over how to use weapons properly, reports Fox.

Terror suspect Sami Osmakac was in trial again today as prosecutors presented footage of him allegedly exchanging weapons with an undercover agent

Fox reports that Osmakac is seen in the video holding guns, learning how to load and reload, and practicing a stance.

Jurors in the court room also saw video footage of Osmakac and the undercover loading a car-bomb and moving materials from a pickup truck to the car that would have been used in the alleged attack.

The undercover was able to film the exchange from a dark room in the upper floor of the building above the parking lot.

Video footage ends with the the undercover agent driving away in the pickup truck and the terror suspect driving away in the car with the fake bomb attached. 

Prosecutors say that Osmakac was driving the car to MacDinton's Irish Pub where he was hoping to detonate it on a busy night.

Video footage and tapes heard in court on Thursday show Osmakac driving with an undercover agent as he allegedly tells him all the spots he planned to attack.

Fox reports the suspect allegedly planned to use grenades and an AK-47 to take hostages at the Hard Rock Casino as he demanded the release of Muslim prisoners.

Fox reports that the jurors were shown the bomb on Thursday and a photo of the bomb was displayed in court as an agent described how it worked to the jurors.

The bomb involved in the alleged attack plan was made of two buckets with sleeves on the outside filled with nails and sharp metal objects aimed at killing as many people as possible.

The bomb also had a cell phone with a 15 minute timer attached so that the attacker would have time to safely escape the area.

The bomb (pictured) given to the terror suspect was a fake that was paid
 for and built in the United States and shown to the court on Thursday

Though the bomb looks real it is a fake model built and paid for by the U.S. Government and it does not explode. 

Osmakac had no idea that he was talking to an undercover agent for the entire interaction and he believed that all the bombs and guns were working weapons.

Osmakac's defense say that their client would never have been able to afford the attack had it not been for the U.S. Government's undercover aid.

The defense argued that the plot wasn't real until Osamakac had funding and weapons. 

According to a federal complaint, 25-year-old Sami Osmakac recorded an eight-minute video shortly before his arrest in January 2012 explaining why he wanted to bring terror to his 'victims' hearts' in the Tampa Bay area.

In the video, Osmakac is seen cross-legged on the floor with a pistol in his hand and an AK-47 behind him. Osmakac said in the video that Muslim blood was more valuable than that of people who do not believe in Islam, according to the complaint. He said he wanted "payback" for wrong that was done to Muslims, according to the complaint.

The area's Muslim community helped provide authorities with information, said Steve Ibison, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Tampa division.
