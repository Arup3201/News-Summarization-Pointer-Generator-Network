A tiny purple sweater is being credited with protecting a Chihuahua puppy from a raging fire that destroyed her owners' home in California earlier this week.

Firefighters responded Wednesday at around 8am to a house fire in the 3300 block of West Camille Street in Santa Ana.

The family living in the house were able to escape, but their 6-month-old Chihuahua named Mellie was left behind on the front porch, where she was tied by her leash.

Lucky dog! This 6-month-old Chihuahua named Mellie escaped a house fire with relatively minor injuries thanks to the purple sweater she had on, which protected her body 

Inferno: An electrical malfunction sparked a giant blaze inside this home in Santa Ana, California, Wednesday 

As first responders were working to extinguish the 50-foot-high flames consuming the structure, Mellie came out running after the fire burnt through her tether, officials told KCAL.

'The first thing that I noticed was that it had a little sweater on that was literally melted to its fur,' Santa Ana Police Department Animal Services Supervisor Sondra Berg told KTLA. 'The sweater was so crisp it was almost like plastic on the outer layer.'

Berg sliced off the knitwear with a knife, to reveal Mellie's body underneath almost entirely untouched by the flames.

The puppy did suffer third-degree burns to her exposed tail and paws, and her whiskers were also singed off.

The lucky dog was taken to the 17th Street Animal Hospital, where veterinarians offered to treat Mellie free of charge, as her owners could not afford to pay for her care after having lost everything in the fire.

Total loss: The inferno, which impacted two homes, caused an estimated $175,000 in property damage

Dr. David Weber confirmed that the Chihuahua owes her life to the wee knitted outfit she had on at the time of the blaze. She is expected to make a full recovery.

It is believed that the fire was sparked by an electrical malfunction. It took firefighters about an hour to put out the flames.

The inferno, which impacted two homes, caused an estimated $175,000 in property damage and displaced more than a dozen members of two families, among them six children.

The family living in the rear house also lost $80,000 worth of possessions, including collectibles, reported the OC Register. In addition, the fire also destroyed an SUV parked on the property.

Mellie's owner was treated for anxiety symptoms she experienced after seeing her dog's injuries.
