Google has been playing both sides of Washington's streets by making contributions to conservative political groups that have left-wingers seeing red, it emerged today. 

But the company is largely just looking out for itself.

The tech giant's grantees include Heritage Action for America, a tea party-oriented organization that some pundits regard as the main catalyst for October's partial government shutdown. Another is Americans for Tax Reform, led by conservative anti-tax crusader – and liberal nemesis – Grover Norquist.

The left-wing Center for Media and Democracy claims that although Google is 'supposedly guided by its "don't be evil" motto,' the normally reliably left-wing company has been 'funding a growing list of groups advancing the agenda of the Koch brothers.'

That's a reference to David and Charles Koch, the billionaire scourges of liberals, who have contributed nearly $220 million to conservative and libertarian groups.

Google co-founder Sergey Brin isn't engaged in a secret plot to help Republicans

Google has put millions into efforts to support an 'open' Internet, pushing for so-called Network Neutrality laws designed to keep Internet service providers from picking winners and losers in the public sphere

But it appears that Google's support for Republican-linked groups may not actually involve money changing hands.

The Cato institute, the best-known libertarian group with national reach, told MailOnline that the company pays only for limited Google ad buys.

'They basically donate free advertising,' said Cato communications vice president Khristine Brookes.

'It amounts to $40,000 per month,' she said in an email. 'We use the grant to buy text ads on the Google search network, promoting our research papers, blog posts, and op-eds, and have found that the ad buys are helpful in driving traffic to our site.'

The anti-tax Norquist wouldn't tell MailOnline if his group's support from Google was aimed at advocating for lower taxes on businesses – like Google.

But Americans for Tax Reform, he said, 'fights to reduce the 35 percent tax on American businesses – higher than the European average of 25 percent – and urges the U.S. to move to a territorial tax system used by most nations in the world,' Norquist said.

'The only disappointment is that some companies are not yet supporting ATR's efforts to restore American competitiveness.'

Territorial systems levy taxes on domestic income, but not foreign income. Google and other companies essentially pay double when they earn income in other countries, since both those countries and the U.S. tax those dollars.

Anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist's group likely caught Google's eye because the company doesn't like paying U.S. taxes on money it earns overseas

Is David Koch, one of the famed right-wing Koch brothers, secretly working with Google? Not likely.

It's raining money: President Obama's re-election campaign took in more than $801,000 from Google employees last year, indicating that the company's rank-and-file is behind the Democratic White House

Heritage Action declined to answer questions about the nature of Google's support. 'We don’t discuss donors,' said the group's communications director, Dan Holler.

A Google spokeswoman declined to provide a Washington Post blogger with details about its support for the organization.

Heritage Action is credited with pitting conservatives against moderate Republicans in September, forcing disagreement about how to counter the Obamacare law – and ultimately leading to the shutdown in October.

Google says in on an online transparency report that its political action committee and philanthropic efforts are mainly oriented toward supporting an 'open Internet,' free from over-regulation and 'controlled by no single organization, individual, or government.'

Despite the surprising dalliances with the political right documented in the transparency report, the company has spread its money to both the right and left for years.

Statistics compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics show that Google donated more to Republican congressional candidates than to Democrats during the 2012 election cycle, and is repeating that pattern for 2014.

But Google's employees gave more than $801,000 last year to president Obama's re-election campaign, and another $622,000 to the Democratic National Committee.

The Center for Media and Democracy 
called its findings 'surprising, given Google's public reputation on 
purportedly progressive issues other than privacy.'
