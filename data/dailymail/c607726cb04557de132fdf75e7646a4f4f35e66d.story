Just before Christmas: Aaron Hernandez spent the holiday behind bars, but he flashed a grin during his most recent court appearance December 23

An uncle of former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez was legally drunk and possibly high on drugs when he died last year in a freak accident, police say.

Robert Valentine's toxicology report came back positive for both alcohol and cocaine after he crashed a scooter early in the morning August 3 in Mr Hernandez's hometown of Bristol, Connecticut, he was also wearing sunglasses.

Mr Valentine's blood alcohol level was 0.19 per cent, more than double the legal limit, the Hartford Courant said, citing a police report.

The combination of alcohol, drugs and sunglasses in the dark led investigators to conclude Mr Valentine, 49, was operating the scooter 'in a negligent manner' when the deadly crash occurred in the dark.

The accident ejected Mr Valentine, who neglected to wear a helmet, from the vehicle, causing him to sustain the critical head injury that caused his death, according to the report.

Mr Valentine's death is one of many twists and turns met by authorities investigating the shooting death of semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd, a Boston
 resident who was dating the sister of Hernandez's girlfriend

Mr Hernandez is charged with murder in connection with Mr Lloyd's death - three people close to him have mysteriously died since the former Patriot was jailed.

Thaddeus Singleton III, who is married to a cousin of Aaron Hernandez, died in June car crash. He was found to have had Cocaethylene, Cocaine, Phencyclidine, Benzoylecgonine and Oxycodone in his system, according to a police report cited by the Bristol Press.

Tabitha Perry, who has a child with Mr Singleton, survived the crash but was found dead last month in a Southington, CT, apartment. That death is still under investigation, according to the Courant.

All three were due to talk to investigators about Mr Hernandez's involvement in the Odin Lloyd case.

Mr Lloyd's body was found June 17 near Hernandez's mansion in North Attleborough, Mass.
