Josh Hardy, the cancer-stricken little boy who 'miraculously' recovered after getting an experimental drug, has returned home.

His jubilant mother announced the news to her hundreds of followers on social media Wednesday.

Josh Hardy from Fredericksburg, 
Virginia, who was battling cancer and an accompanying infection, became part of a new clinical trial for the drug brincidofovir after his parents started the social media campaign #SaveJosh to lobby the pharmaceutical company Chimerix Inc.

'Glory to GOD! We are going home!!!! Leaving today. After 6 1/2 months, Josh finally gets to be in his house,' Aimee Hardy wrote to her hundreds of followers on her Facebook page.

Going home: Josh Hard, 8, returned home on Thursday after his 'miracle' recovery from a combination of cancer and a kidney infection

Josh's parents rallied around him when eh fell sick and started a massive social media campaign to pressure Chimerix Inc. to put him on an experimental drug

'His Kidney function has returned and he is free of the need of Dialysis. His heart function is within normal range. His lung function is perfect. His tummy is coming around. He has not had the need of a blood transfusion in a month.'

After the boy's remarkable recovery, his supporters changed their hashtag to #SavedJosh.

Early this morning, Josh and his parents arrived at their home in Virginia after a 14 and a half hour journey from St. Jude Children's Hopsital in Memphis, Tennessee.

Josh will be able to stay home and recover from his horrific illness until late this month, when he will return to St. Jude's for a checkup. After that, he gets to stay out of the hospital until January.

'It is by Jesus' stripes he is healed. Everyone knows Josh is a true miracle,' Ms Hardy said.

No slogan: After Josh began to get better, his supporters changed their hashtag from #SaveJosh

The gravely ill little boy was given 
the experimental drug after his parents made their high-profile plea to 
the boss of Chimerix.

Josh was fighting for his life in March after contracting the infection that caused internal bleeding and heart and kidney failure.

But his family said the virus was barely detectable after just four doses of Brincidofovir.

Ms Hardy, who lobbied the drug company, told ABC 11
 earlier this year: 'We have gone from dire circumstances to discussing 
with our doctors what we need to do to get Josh discharged from the 
hospital.

'We are so grateful that the company was able to find a way for Josh to receive the medicine.'

Josh was moved from ICU to a regular room at St Jude Children's Hospital, in Memphis, before he was later discharged.

Earlier
 this year, Josh could barely speak and was vomiting 
blood, while his family kept a desperate vigil at his bedside.

Josh's body, weakened by chemotherapy after he had cancer for the fourth time, was struggling to fight of the adenovirus.

The
 only available drugs were not working and Chimerix had refused to give 
the family access to the experimental medication Brincidofovir.

But, after his family launched the 
#savejosh campaign, Chimerix relented. The company, in return, has been 
allowed to use data from Josh to help its FDA application, which could 
bring the drug on the market earlier.

Chimerix
 chief Kenneth Moch announced on Tuesday, March 11, that his firm would 
begin a pilot trial for the drug immediately - with Josh as the 
program's first patient.

Moch
 had faced huge criticism for denying Josh Brincidofovir to fight off an
 infection he developed after a bone marrow transplant.
