Martian bases could be built on the red planet by robots excavating underground caves, a group of German architects has claimed.

The team from ZA Architects believes that basalt, already detected on the red planet by rovers, could be used as a building material to create large underground caves and create a ‘martian cement’.

‘The surface of Mars is primarily composed of basalt, and the Phoenix lander directly sampled water ice in Martian soil,’ the team say.

‘Basalt is good material to make a protectional cave on, to produce insulation, and basalt roving, which is stronger than steel.’

The rovers would excavate large caves underground, leaving pillars of basalt to support the roof.

When human explorers arrive, they would simply need to install windows, doors and life support systems.

Rockets with digging robots are sent to Mars and search for large areas of Basalt.

Robots analyse basalt columns for strength. They then drill basalt, moving down and leaving pillars of the material as large 
columns to support the cave’s roof.

Astronauts finish the construction 
and arrange technical facilities as water, oxygen, windows and doors 
using basalt material spun as a glass-fibre like cement.

‘Curiosity sooner or later will bring human to Mars and wouldn't it be nice to have permanent station to explore it?’ Arina Ageeva of ZA Architects told Dezeen.

‘It seems pretty logical to use caves as the main protective structure of the colony.'

The team even believe basalt could be used to create a ‘spider’s silk’ material similar to glass fibre that could be used as a building material.

‘We can weave minimal surfaces that will be used as floors on different levels in the cave,’ she told Dezeen.

The architects propose that roving robots will weave spatial spider-like web that will be used as spaces and construction to hold domestic
and technical facilities

‘This material is already in use in the aerospace and automotive industries. It is stronger and lighter than steel, easier to operate, fireproof and it does not corrode,’ she added.

They also believe the bases could include farming areas, saying ‘some martian soil is appropriate for growing certain agricultures, such as asparagus.

‘Possibility of food production will make Martian settlements independent of expensive deliveries from the Earth.’
