I will never forget my first training session at Monaco. In all the years I've played football, I never stood on the ball. But there was something about the unfamiliarity after 13 years at Tottenham which must have distracted me or overawed me. Because, sure enough, in the middle of that first training session when I was desperate to make an impression, I stood on the ball and almost ended up on my backside.

Mark Hateley, who had been signed with me, was killing himself laughing. I shouted over to him: 'I bet they're wondering just what they've signed here!'

But I was mortified. I was determined to prove myself and for some reason nerves or expectations had got the better of me.

It is a good illustration of the challenges a move abroad can bring. Things which seemed simple when playing in familiar surroundings take on a new dimension, both in the football world and the wider culture.

I had the language to deal with off the pitch and on the pitch I was really frustrated early on that I wasn't getting the ball enough.

I was used to being at the heart of Tottenham's game but you had to prove yourself all over again to a new coaching staff and new players.

I mention this now because of Steven Gerrard's announcement that he will be joining LA Galaxy.

I think it will be a fantastic experience for him, even at this stage of his career. And though I, like many, can't help admiring his loyalty and commitment to Liverpool over the years, there is a little part of me that would have loved to have seen him make the move abroad a few years ago, at the peak of his career.

It is said he had opportunities to join Real Madrid and I'm sure all the leading clubs from the top leagues would have been interested in signing him if there had been an opportunity. Of course, everyone is different and I totally respect his decision to stay at Liverpool. But he might have become an even better player had he gone abroad earlier.

Just being in a different country and a different culture changes you. Tactically it is a challenge. When I left for Monaco, English football was still very stuck in a similar way of playing, with 4-4-2 the standard, something I had become very used to.

In France I suddenly found myself being man-marked, which had never happened in England.

I had to adjust my game, coming behind the ball a little and getting into false positions, to cause my marker problems and give him decisions to make. It made me think that little bit harder.

Every day you were challenged off the pitch, whether it was because of the language or eating habits or cultural differences.

Like Steven, I had young daughters at the time, so living near the beach and in a sunny climate was just fantastic. Ultimately, I think that made me more open as a person. It made me open my mind to new ideas.

The huge difference then was the approach to diet and medicine in France and England.

Don't forget we had a young Arsene Wenger in charge at Monaco and at that stage the French, in general, and Arsene, in particular, were miles ahead of the English.

There was a magnificent osteopath there at the time called Michel Franco who opened my eyes to all sorts of things in terms of injury prevention. At training we had all the masseurs and chiropractors that are now normal in England but weren't then.

The stretching was new to me and the diet was completely different. These things were a revelation to me at the time.

Of course, those differences wouldn't be so pronounced now but there will be other areas in which things will be done differently that will make you think.

It doesn't necessarily have to be a wrench to go; fans are much more likely to understand if you're clear with them and move abroad rather than to a direct rival.

I did 13 years at Tottenham as a pro and I'd always made it pretty well known that I wanted to challenge myself abroad. I can't remember any fans giving me a hard time; I think they understood.

Steven has had a wonderful career at Liverpool, whereas my ambition had always been to play abroad.

I nearly went to FC Koln in Germany when I was 21 and then to Napoli after the 1982 World Cup, when Rudi Krol was there.

Finally, at the age of 28, the right move came to Monaco. I never regretted it and I'm sure Steven won't regret this new phase of his life.

There has been a lot of focus on refereeing standards over the Christmas period but for me it has highlighted that they need more help in the modern game, which is so much quicker and intense than ever before.

And there are a couple of areas in which I would love to see a clampdown. The first is diving. 

It is an attempt to cheat a fellow professional and in that way is as bad as an over-the-top tackle. It seems impossible for a referee to make a 100 per cent accurate judgment in real time as to whether a player is diving — the Cesc Fabregas case at Southampton, where he was wrongly booked, was a good illustration of that. Equally, some players are getting away with it.

There should be a facility to review games on TV at the end of the weekend and then punish players or exonerate them retrospectively.

That would also act as a deterrent to a player for whom diving is a part of the game. He might get away with it on the pitch, but the TV cameras would invariably catch him.

But the other aspect of the game which I want to see stamped out wouldn’t need TV replays: it is players brandishing imaginary cards in an attempt to encourage the referee to book or send an opponent off.

Whenever that happens I think the referee should have the power to simply reverse the decision and award the free kick the other way. It would soon stop then.

As a player in the Eighties, winning the FA Cup was as important as winning the league. In fact, some fans and players would prioritise it above the league.

I was lucky enough to win finals, so it was a special tournament for me.

Last weekend we at QPR had a dreadful result against Sheffield United but it again illustrated what an extraordinary competition it can be.

Last Monday, as AFC Wimbledon contended with Liverpool, the game could have gone either way at 1-1. 

There were plenty of ties like that, with Blyth Spartans, Yeovil and Cambridge United all playing their part. It was a good weekend for the competition.

The FA Cup might never be what it was but it is an important part of the football calendar and, bit by bit, is recovering its old glory.
