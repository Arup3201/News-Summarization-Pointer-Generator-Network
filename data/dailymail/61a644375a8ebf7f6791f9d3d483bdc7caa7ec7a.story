The Government will not be deterred from going ahead with the High Speed 2 rail line by the 'grief and hassle' it is getting from backbenchers, the Transport Secretary said today.

Patrick McLoughlin said he intends to fast-track the line, which will initially connect London and Birmingham and is later planned to be extended to Manchester and Leeds.

And he said he hoped to work with Labour to get cross-party consensus on legislation to be included in the next Queen's Speech and taken through Parliament before the 2015 general election.

He said he would 'love to' complete the project within five years, although he accepted it will probably take longer.

The new Transport Secretary told the Conservative conference in Birmingham earlier this week that he would like the HS2 line eventually to stretch as far as Scotland.

Mr McLoughlin told The Independent: 'The easiest thing for any government to do on a project the size of HS2 is to say we are not doing it.

'All we get is grief. All we get is hassle. But one of the things that government have got to try and do is look to the long term future.

'Whichever route we are going to put it on we are going to upset people.'

Mr
McLoughlin said he was assured, when he was appointed to the transport 
brief in last month's reshuffle, that HS2 had the support of Prime 
Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne, despite the 
opposition of some Tory backbenchers.

'The Chancellor is committed to it, the Chancellor is determined it goes to the North,' he said.

Mr McLoughlin's comments follow last week's fiasco over the West Coast Main Line contract.

The Government awarded the new 
£7billion franchise to rivals FirstGroup, but cancelled it before the 
planned handover in December after Sir Richard Branson's Virgin group – which 
offered £700million less - made a successful legal challenge on the 
grounds that the Government had ‘got its sums wrong’.

Details of the problems which led to 
the scuppering of the FirstGroup franchise would never have emerged had Virgin not taken the Department to court.

Taxpayers are on track to pay more 
than £100million after Mr McLoughlin pulled the plug on the whole 
process a minute after midnight on Wednesday  saying ‘unacceptable 
mistakes’ had been made by the DfT.

The news caused First Group’s shares to plummet by 20 per cent wiping £240million off its value within hours.

Untypical Tory: Patrick McLoughlin is proud of his mining background

Patrick McLoughlin was born in 1957 in Stafford, the son and grandson of coal miners.

Unlike many of his peers in the Tory party, he was educated at a comprehensive - Cardinal Griffin Roman Catholic School in Cannock, Staffordshire - leaving at 16. He later went on to Staffordshire College of Agriculture at Rodbaston College.

In 1974 he began working on a farm, and five years later he began work at the Littleton Colliery in Cannock - becoming a member of the National Union of Mineworkers.

McLoughlin was elected as a councillor on the Cannock Chase District Council for seven years from 1980, and also a councillor on Staffordshire County Council from 1981-87.

In 1982, He served as the Chairman of the National Young Conservatives.

His break into Parliament came in 1986, when Matthew Parris, the Conservative MP for West Derbyshire, resigned from the House of Common, and McLoughlin was chosen to fight the by-election. He held on to the sea with a narrow 100 majority.

McLoughlin was made a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1989, and served in the Department for Transport until 1992, when he was moved by John Major to serve in the same position at the Department of Employment.

A year later he was moved again, this time to the Department of Trade and Industry.

He joined the government Whips' Office in 1995 as an assistant, becoming a Lord Commissioner in 1996.

After the Conservative Party's defeat at the 1997 general election, he remained in the whips' office in opposition, becoming the Deputy Chief Whip in 1998.

He was then promoted to Chief Whip by David Cameron in 2005.

Following the 2010 election, Prime Minister David Cameron made McLoughlin the government's Chief Whip and Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury in the Coalition government.

He was once reprimanded by Speaker John Bercow for inappropriate behaviour within the House of Commons.

In September 2012, following a Cabinet reshuffle, McLoughlin was appointed Secretary of State for Transport.
