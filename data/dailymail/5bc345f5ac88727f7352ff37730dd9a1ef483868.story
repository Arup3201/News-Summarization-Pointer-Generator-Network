A student was awoken in the night by a serial burglar who forced his terrified victim to strip and dance before he sexually assaulted her.

Stephen Smith, 18, threatened the 
21-year-old woman with a pair of scissors and said he would 
kill her family if she did not do exactly what he wanted, after he broke into her London property on June 5.

Today a judge branded Smith's crimes 'pitiless and life-scarring' as he sentenced the teenager, from Stratford in east London, for nine and a half years.

The prolific burglar had left a 'trail of misery behind him' as he targeted homes in London's upmarket Mayfair area as well as properties in the east of the capital, in order, according to the prosecution,  to 'lead a glamorous lifestyle'.

Smith, who has a two-year-old daughter, broke into 23 homes between April and June of this year stealing more than £40,000 of property and a string of expensive cars, including a BMW and a £10,000 Audi.

Southwark Crown Court heard that since turning 13 the father had committed a total of 63 burglaries.

Jailing him, Judge Alistair McCreath said although Smith may have been drunk when he carried out some of his burglaries all were calculated.

Quoting from a statement by the Lord Chief Justice, Mr McCreath said: 'To be burgled and then subjected to the dreadful indignity of a violent, sexual offence,' and I know you did not use actual violence but you threatened it, 'is to become the victim of a pitiless, wicked crime, as those are pitiless, life-scarring, deliberately committed crimes'.

'What you did that night hardly needs repeating but you burgled that home and when the young woman, alone in her bed, awoke to find you in her room you threatened her with scissors, made her strip naked and dance for you, and you subjected her to a serious sexual assault.'

The court heard heard that Smith had climbed into the student's home through an open window before raiding the property and walking into her bedroom.

Prosecutor Peter Zinner said: 'He told her that if she did not stay there and stay still he would kill her family, and bizarrely told her his name was Paul Smith.

'He then demanded that she get out of bed.

'He took hold of the scissors and ordered her to strip naked and then told her that she must dance for him.'

Smith took off his trousers and underwear and forced her on to her bed before he began to lick her body.

Mr Zinner added: 'The Crown's case is that the defendant is a financially motivated, skilful, and prolific burglar who, between April and June of this year, left a trail of misery behind him.

'He then escalated what was already very serious offending to a new level by a prolonged and terrifying sexual assault on a female burglary victim alone in her dwelling.

'It was for financial gain to live a glamorous lifestyle well beyond what he was able to afford.

'The sexual assault was gratuitous, probably unplanned, but nevertheless devastating for the victim concerned.'

For Smith, defence counsel Safora Syed said the teenager had suffered a 'feeling of rejection' after discovering, when he was 13, that he was adopted.

She said: 'The reason why he wanted to make money was in order for him to pay off a drug debt'.

Smith's latest spate of offending began on April 29, 2012, when he stole a phone and set of house keys  along with key's to a Vauxhall Astra which he drove off in.

The court heard the property was snatched by Smith after the householder fell asleep at the teenager's east London home after a night out in Romford, Essex.

On May 12 he broke into a flat in east London, and stole a laptop and a hat.

Just 12 days later he burgled neighbouring flats in Mayfair, snatching property worth around £28,000, including phones, computers, cash, a camera and a watch.

He struck again the following night at another flat, also in Mayfair, where he took a mobile.

Mr Zinner said the female owner had 
been asleep but had awoken to find Smith 'asleep at the foot of her bed,
covered in vomit and smelling of intoxicating liquor'.

Smith
fled the flat, but when the owner investigated she found her collection
of designer handbags lined up by the sofa 'ready to be taken'.

He
returned to the same flat less than a fortnight later and attempted to 
break in a second time before trying to get into another flat in the 
same building.

Between May 
27 and June 10 Smith also targeted a string of other west London 
properties as well as homes in east London, stealing computers, and 
other electrical equipment as well as the keys to Honda, Audi, and BMW 
cars.

All three cars were taken and dumped by Smith.

Smith, of Stratford, in east London, admitted ten counts of burglary, four counts of taking a conveyance without authority, two counts of theft, two count of attempting to commit a burglary, one count of sexual assault and one count of assault by penetration.

Smith, who has previously been convicted of eight burglaries, asked for a further 12 offences of burglary to be taken into consideration.

He was jailed for nine-and-a-half years, banned from driving for two years, and ordered to sign on the sexual offenders register for life.
