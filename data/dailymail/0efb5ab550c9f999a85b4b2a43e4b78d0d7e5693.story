To her wealthy clients and friends, she was a successful and charming businesswoman.

Kankamol Albon’s skill at convincing people to buy luxury cars allowed her to live in a £4million, 14th-century mansion with ten bedrooms and a moat, take expensive holidays and send her five children to private schools.

But her lavish lifestyle turned out to be built on a pyramid scheme in which she defrauded investors of £7.5million. She has now been jailed for six years.

Prison: 'Greed driven' Kankamol Albon, 41, (pictured) has now been jailed after she admitted her luxury car dealership was 
nothing more than a front for a fraud operation which raked in millions 
of pounds

Albon, 41, known to her friends as 
‘Minky’, talked her victims into handing over huge sums of money to buy 
prestige cars including Ferraris and Bentleys, but many customers never 
received them.

In one deal, she sold the same vehicle to two different people, Ipswich Crown Court heard on Wednesday.

The complicated Ponzi scheme saw Albon
use money from new customers to pay off her most disgruntled creditors.
Some people took out loans of hundreds of thousands of pounds on the 
promise of huge returns. A few lost their homes, cars and businesses.

Even while on bail after her arrest, 
she tried to fleece HM Revenue and Customs of £1.8million by pretending 
to sell cars abroad and claiming back VAT on the deals.

Albon was sentenced after admitting 
charges of false representation and cheating the public revenue in what 
Judge Rupert Overbury called a ‘massive’, ‘greed-driven’ fraud.

He told Albon: ‘You persistently defrauded investors who were told that you were able to buy and sell high-value motor vehicles, such as Bugattis, Ferraris, Rolls-Royces and Maseratis, which you claimed could be immediately sold for profit and would be available for the personal use of investors. The majority of investors never saw a car.

‘They were persuaded to roll over so-called profits you were making so you could maintain the illusion you were running a profitable business.’

Albon, who was raised in Thailand and came to Britain 28 years ago, started working as a bookkeeper in 1993 at NA Carriage Company, which was in the name of her now estranged husband Nigel, 55, a former racing driver.

She took over the company in 2004 and the court heard that it made vast sums. At one point, she withdrew £580,000 and spent it on her home, Smallbridge Hall, in Bures, near Sudbury, Suffolk, where she ran the business and lived with her three daughters and two sons.

Greed: Julian Christopher, prosecuting, told 
Ipswich Crown Court (file picture) the mother-of-five would keep the money paid to her 
by clients for their luxury car. The judge described her fraud as 'massive' 

In August 2008, the company failed and
police became involved six months later, when a victim launched a civil
case to recover money. After her arrest, she claimed that she had been 
blackmailed into selling hundreds of luxury cars for less than their 
market value.

However, Julian Christopher, 
prosecuting, said that Albon had run a Ponzi scheme. ‘As her losses 
grew, so did the need for further investors and customers,’ he said.

'We are satisfied she acted alone and her sole motivation was one of excessive greed and the desire to buy luxury goods and live an opulent lifestyle'

Kevin Baumber, defending, said the 
business had been run legitimately for years but got into trouble after 
losing millions in a foreign business venture. Albon’s VAT fraud 
involved sales to overseas investors, but 107 of the 122 deals she 
reported did not exist.

Smallbridge Hall was repossessed and is now on sale for £3.9million.

Detective Constable Adrian Finbow, of 
Suffolk Police, said the inquiry was complicated by Albon’s ‘pointing 
the finger at others’.

He said: ‘We are satisfied she acted 
alone and her sole motivation was one of excessive greed and the desire 
to buy luxury goods and live an opulent lifestyle.’
