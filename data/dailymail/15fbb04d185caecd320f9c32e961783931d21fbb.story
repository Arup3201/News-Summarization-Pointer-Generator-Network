A deal over Iran's nuclear weapons should be struck with the US within three months, the Iranian President has said.

Speaking before a landmark UN meeting between Iran and six world powers, Hassan Rouhani has said Tehran wants a quick resolution to the nuclear issue.

Speaking to the Washington Post, Mr Rouhani said: 'The only way forward is for a timeline to be inserted into the negotiations that's shortâ€“and wrap it up.

'That is a decision of my government, that short is necessary to settle the nuclear file.

Hassan Rouhani has said that any deal over his country's nuclear proramme 'is a question of months not years'

Rouhani faces a back lash in his country after seeming to concede that the holocaust happened in a TV interview after eight years of denials from former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad

'The shorter it is the more beneficial it is to everyone. If it's three months that would be Iran's choice, if it's six months that's still good. It's a question of months not years.'

The apparent thawing of relations between America and Iran in recent weeks has seen Rouhani apparently admit that the holocaust happened in an interview broadcast on CNN.

Rouhani's predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad spent years denying the holocaust as part of his rhetoric against the Jewish state of Israel, one of America's strongest Middle Eastern allies.

While the new President would not be drawn on the scale or numbers invovled, he is now facing a backlash at home after a conservative new agency accused CNN of wrongly translating the remark.

The improvement in relations between Iran and the West has also prompted the father of an imprisoned former U.S. Marine to beg for his son's release.

Ali Hekmati is asking Rouhani to order the release of his son, Amir, as Ali is now suffering with a brain tumour and may not have long to live.

In a letter, the ailing father says: 'I long more than ever to see Amir's face. I am now very sick.

'I ask that you let me see him again, one more time, and so that he may lead our family when I am gone.

'Amir is a good man. An honorable man. He is not a spy, I can assure you of that.'

Amir Hekmati, a joint U.S. Iranian citizen, has been in prison in Iran since 2011 after being convicted of spying

Amir Hekmati, who has dual U.S. and Iranian citizenship, was arrested in Iran in 2011. The family claim he was visiting his grandmother but the Islamic state accused him of being a CIA spy and convicted him.

A short while later a video was released showing Amir 'confessing' to his crimes.

Amir's father has reason to be hopeful after Iran freed dozens of political prisoners last week, just as Rouhani was headed to New York for the annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly.

Earlier this month, Amir wrote a letter to US Secretary of Sate John Kerry describing his 'miserable prison conditions' and his belief that Tehran wanted to use him in a possible prisoner exchange.

Hekmati's letter was smuggled out of prison and his sister authenticated the handwriting.

The State Department said it was trying to determine Hekmati's condition through Swiss diplomats in Tehran.

The Swiss represent U.S. interests in Iran because no U.S. officials are based there. The two countries severed diplomatic relations in 1979.

Two other American citizens are believed to be detained in Iran: Retired FBI agent Robert Levinson and Christian pastor Saeed Abedini.

The release of prisoners and the softening on nuclear talks are part of a fresh charm offensive by Iran following years of icy relations under the former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

As a condition of any deal Iran has said it will agree to international inspections along the lines of those between 2003 and 2005 and has not ruled out a meeting with Barack Obama.

Rouhani added: 'If Mr Obama and I were to get together, we would both be looking at the 
future, and the prospects ahead and our hopes for that future.

'The notes and 
letters and exchanges between us are in that direction, and they will 
continue. We need a beginning point. I think that is the nuclear issue.'
