Olivier Giroud could be back in action for Arsenal sooner than first thought - and in a partnership with Danny Welbeck.

Gunners boss Arsene Wenger revealed fans could see Giroud back before the initial prognosis of next year after successful surgery on a foot injury.

And he could find himself in a new system alongside fellow Emirates frontman Welbeck.

'Olivier Giroud is recovering very well,' Wenger told beIN Sports.

'I believe he is ahead of schedule in terms of rehabilitation. The operation went perfectly.  

'Welbeck and [Giroud] can play together in the centre or separately.' 

The Arsenal boss cites examples of Welbeck's versatility while at Manchester United as a reason why the duo can work as a partnership. 

Wenger added: 'Welbeck also played on one side to Manchester United. Welbeck played in the same team with Rooney and van Persie. He can play down the sides.'

Since joining the Gunners in a £16million deal last month, the England forward has scored four goals in six appearances for the club.
