A fixation with 'glitzy, celebrity' 
weddings fuelled by glossy magazines is overshadowing the true meaning 
of marriage, says Iain Duncan Smith.

The
 Work and Pensions Secretary warned that the obsession with expensive 
nuptials is discouraging many youngsters from tying the knot and 
starting families.

And those
 that do are frequently left saddled with debts from the ceremony that 
add unnecessary strain to their relationships, he told a meeting of 
divorce lawyers and marriage guidance experts.

Fairytale: A fixation with 'glitzy, celebrity' weddings fuelled by glossy magazines is overshadowing the true meaning of marriage, says Iain Duncan Smith

Mr Duncan Smith has led efforts to encourage couples to marry with proposals for tax breaks and changes to the benefits system.

But
 he told a conference organised by the Marriage Foundation that it had 
become almost taboo to praise the virtues of marriage for the good of 
society.

The numbers of 
young people choosing to marry has fallen steadily in recent decades, 
but Mr Duncan Smith said polls sggested that at least three quarters of 
them ranked marriage highly among their goals for life.

One of the reasons for the reluctance to tie the knot is the spiralling cost of a wedding, he claimed.

The Telegraph quoted him as saying that young people have 'a kind of unrealistic expectation of what married life will be like, and in some cases almost an incredible fairytale view of what will happen.'

He said: 'Reinforced by a glitzy celebrity culture and the glossy spreads of the various glossy magazines, the focus is too often on the ceremony itself, the celebration of that event.

'And now, I understand, by some estimates, it costs something in the order of about £20,000 to establish that.'

He added: 'What seems to have been forgotten is that the point of marriage is, of course, love, commitment and that stable environment in which you can then bring up a family.'

Mr Duncan Smith's comments came after he earlier this year proposed tax breaks to encourage what he called the 'most important man-made institution'.

Under plans announced by the 
Government in September a husband or wife would be able to transfer 
£1,000 of their tax-free personal allowance to their spouse.

It
 would apply if couples are both basic rate taxpayers with one spouse 
earning less than the allowance. Gay couples in civil partnerships would
 also be eligible.

Around 
four million people are expected to benefit from the plans, which have 
been delayed because of opposition from Deputy Prime Minister Nick 
Clegg.
