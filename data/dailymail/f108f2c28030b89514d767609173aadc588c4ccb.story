Russian officials have admitted today there is no firm indication where a failed Mars moon probe plummeted to Earth, the day after
it went down.

The unmanned Phobos-Ground probe - which had been designed to boost the nation's pride - fell after being stuck in Earth's orbit for two months.

News agencies had cited Defence Ministry
spokesman Colonel Alexei Zolotukhin as saying yesterday that fragments of the craft fell
in the Pacific Ocean off Chile's coast, 1,250 km (775 miles) west of Wellington Island.

He said the military space tracking facilities
were monitoring the probe's crash - and that the deserted ocean area is where Russia guides its discarded
space cargo ships serving the International Space Station.

But Zolotukhin has now revealed the estimate was based on calculations, and no witness reports
had been received.

However, the deputy head of Russia's space agency,
Anatoly Shilov, told state news channel Vesti that agency data assumed the
craft broke up somewhere over Brazil

This theory was reinforced by other sources.

RIA Novosti news agency cited
Russian ballistic experts who said the fragments fell over a broader patch of
Earth's surface, spreading from the Atlantic and including the territory of
Brazil.

It said the midpoint of the crash zone was located in the Brazilian
state of Goias.

The $170million craft was one of the
heaviest and most toxic pieces of space junk ever to crash to Earth, but space
officials and experts said the risks posed by its crash were minimal because
the toxic rocket fuel on board and most of the craft's structure would burn up
in the atmosphere high above the ground anyway.

The Phobos-Ground was designed to travel
to one of Mars' twin
moons, Phobos, land on it, collect soil samples and fly them back to Earth in
2014 in one of the most daunting interplanetary missions ever.

It got stranded
in Earth's orbit after its November 9 launch, and efforts by Russian and European
Space Agency experts to bring it back to life failed.

Professor Heiner Klinkrad, head of The
European Space Agency's Space Debris Office that was monitoring the probe's
descent, said the craft didn't pose any significant risks.

'This one is way, way down in the
ranking,' he said in a telephone interview from his office in Berlin,
adding that booster rockets contain more solid segments that may survive fiery
re-entries.

The probe's return to Earth was also monitored by dozens of other organisations, 
including the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordinating Committee, an 
offshoot of the UN's Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer 
Space. The panel includes representatives from 12 space agencies, 
including Nasa, Russia and China.

Thousands of pieces of derelict space
vehicles orbit Earth, occasionally posing danger to astronauts and satellites
in orbit, but as far as is known, no one has ever been hurt by falling space
debris.

Russia's space agency Roscosmos predicted
that only between 20 and 30 fragments of the Phobos probe with a total weight
of up to 200kg (440lb) would survive the re-entry and plummet to
Earth.

Klinkrad agreed with that assessment,
adding that about 100 metric tons of space junk fall on Earth every year. 'This is 200kg out of these 100 tons,' he said.

The Phobos-Ground weighed 13.5 metric tons
(14.9 tons), and that included a load of 11 metric tons (12 tons) of highly
toxic rocket fuel intended for the long journey to the Martian moon of Phobos but which remained unused as the probe got stranded in orbit around Earth.

Roscosmos said that all of the fuel would  have burned up on re-entry, a forecast Klinkrad said was supported by calculations
done by Nasa and the ESA.

He said the craft's tanks are made of aluminium alloy
that has a very low melting temperature, and they would burst at an altitude of
more than 100km (60 miles).

The space era has seen far larger
spacecraft crash. Nasa's Skylab space station that went down in 1979 weighed 77
metric tons (85 tons) and Russia's Mir space station that de-orbited in 2001
weighed about 130 metric tons (143 tons).

Their descent fuelled fears around the
world, but the wreckage of both fell far away from populated areas.

Flying fuel tank: The failed probe contained 11 tons of highly toxic fuel

The Phobos-Ground was Russia's most
expensive and the most ambitious space mission since Soviet times.

Its mission
to the crater-dented, potato-shaped Martian moon was to give scientists
precious materials that could shed more light on the genesis of the solar
system.

Russia's space chief has acknowledged the
Phobos-Ground mission was ill-prepared, but said that Roscosmos had to give it
the go-ahead so as not to miss the limited Earth-to-Mars launch window.

Its predecessor, Mars-96, which was built by the same
Moscow-based NPO Lavochkin company, experienced an engine failure and crashed
shortly after its launch in 1996.

Its crash drew strong international fears
because of around 200g of plutonium onboard.

The craft eventually showered
its fragments over the Chile-Bolivia border in the Andes Mountains, and the
pieces were never recovered.

The worst ever radiation spill from a
derelict space vehicle came in January 1978 when the nuclear-powered Cosmos 954
satellite crashed over northwestern Canada.

The Soviets claimed the craft
completely burned up on re-entry, but a massive recovery effort by Canadian
authorities recovered a dozen fragments, most of which were radioactive.

The Phobos-Ground also contained a tiny
quantity of the radioactive metal Cobalt-57 in one of its instruments, but
Roscosmos said it poses no threat of radioactive contamination.

The spacecraft also carried a small
cylinder with a collection of microbes as part of an experiment by the
Pasadena, California-based Planetary Society that was designed to explore whether
they could survive interplanetary travel.

The cylinder was attached to a capsule
that was supposed to deliver Phobos ground samples back to Earth.

Igor Marinin, the editor of Russia's
Novosti Kosmonavtiki magazine, said on Russia's NTV television that it would
likely be destroyed.

And Igor Lissov, an 
independent Moscow-based space observer said: 'The fuel indeed poses lethal danger 
in case of close contact, but I haven’t heard of a single case of any 
civilians poisoned by rocket fuel from all the derelict satellites and 
failed rockets throughout the space era.

'The objective reality is that it burns on re-entry. There is no reason to panic.'

Jonathan McDowell of the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said that the probability is low that a large lump of toxic fuel will prove hazardous.

He noted that some of the probe’s 
equipment is dense and could survive re-entry, but added the odds are 
that any surviving pieces have ended up in the ocean.

He said: 'All the best rules in the world put
 in place to prevent uncontrolled satellites from crashing down do 
little if any good in the event of a launch failure.

Botched: The ambitious mission was meant to re-install pride in the Russian space agency

'This is always going to be the risk that something breaks, and you end 
up with a situation like this. You can minimise it, but you can’t 
prevent it entirely.'

Michael Simpson, executive director of the Colorado-based Secure World Foundation, said: 'With 73 per cent of the planet 
covered in water, odds are this thing is going to splash down rather 
than hit land,' he said.

In
 2008, the U.S. Navy shot down a stranded U.S. spy satellite reportedly 
to cut the contamination risk of 100lb (45kg) of rocket fuel. That
 satellite's tank, however, was believed to have been made of metal 
alloys more resistant to heating than aluminium, Simpson said.

The
 spacecraft is the third large satellite to return to Earth since 
September, when Nasa's defunct Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite fell 
out of orbit, showering debris into the Pacific Ocean. Germany's Rosat 
X-ray telescope re-entered a month later over the Bay of Bengal.

Phobos is the larger and closer of the two moons of Mars, the other being Deimos.

Both moons were discovered in 1877, Phobos named after the Greek god Phobos, a son of Ares (Mars).

A small, irregular-shaped object, Phobos orbits Mars closer than any other known moon orbits its planet.

It orbits so close to the planet that
 it moves around Mars faster than Mars itself rotates. As a result, from
 the surface of the planet, Phobos would rise in the west, move rapidly 
across the sky (in a little over four hours) and set in the east.

Indeed, its orbit is decaying and will eventually smash into the surface of Mars or break up into a Saturn-like planetary ring.

Phobos is one of the least-reflective bodies in the solar system, and features a large impact crater, Stickney crater.

Phobos has been photographed in close-up by several spacecraft, whose primary mission has been to photograph Mars.

The
 first was Mariner 9 in 1971, followed by Viking 1 in 1977, Mars Global 
Surveyor in 1998 and 2003, Mars Express in 2004, 2008, and 2010, and 
Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter in 2007 and 2008.
