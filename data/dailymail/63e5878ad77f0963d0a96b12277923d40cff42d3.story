If the mantra is to be believed; sugar is bad.

Whether it's a sneaky cream cake or a chocolate biscuit, sometimes only a sweet treat will do.

And that's without the foods and drinks that contain 'hidden' sugars, which could be leading to weight gain without being realised.

Swapping a gin and tonic for Baileys, pancakes with lemon tart and clementines for orange juice are just some of the surprising swaps that can help you cut down on sugar consumption. 

Fruit juice counts as the more harmful 'free' or added sugar source, as the natural sugars it contains are no longer safely enclosed within the cell structure of the whole fruit

The next time you want an orange hit, choose two clementines (left) instead of a glass of orange juice (right)

Registered nutritionist Angela Dowden has devised a guilt-free sugar swap system for FEMAIL that that still allows sugar cravings to be satisfied.

‘As fruit juice counts as the more harmful “free” or added sugar source, as the natural sugars it contains are no longer safely enclosed within the cell structure of the whole fruit.’ Ms Dowden explained.

She advises replacing a 200ml glass of juice for two clementines, which will see you cutting out a whopping two teaspoons of sugar.

She revealed that over 10 per cent of the sugar in our diet comes from alcoholic drinks. 

'Surprisingly over 10 per cent of the sugar in our diet comes from alcoholic drinks and Baileys is a major culprit. Go for dry wines, or spirits with slimline mixers instead,' she suggested. 

And there’s no need to go without sweet thing like pancakes, cakes and ice-cream. 

Coffee drinkers should replace sugar with sugar alternatives, Ms Dowden advised

Have your cake and eat it too: Nutritionist Angela Dowden has devised a guilt-free sugar swap system for Femail that that still allows you to satisfy your sugar cravings

‘Pancakes can be a lower sugar dessert if you're canny with the topping choices,’ she said.

'If you want to eat cake but still keep your sugar in check, you’ll often be better off with a small cream-filled one. 

'Ice creams vary in their sugar content; two scoops of Ben and Jerry’s Cookie dough contains almost twice the sugar of two scoops Haagen Daz Vanilla, she revealed. 

If it’s a chocolate hit you crave, replace the bar with a slice of toast spread Nutella.

‘Nutella on toast - keep the Nutella to a level tablespoon - is lower in both sugar and calories than most chocolate bars,’ Ms Dowden advised.

Cereals also get the swap treatment. 

'It’s not always easy to tell which are the most sugary cereals, so always read the label. More than 15-20g sugar per 100g is a lot,' she explained. 

Ditch balsamic vinegar (left) in salads and have French dressing instead (right)

Swap sugar in your tea for sweetener and according to Ms Dowden, 'in four cuppas a day you could save enough calories to lose a pound in a month.'

Planning on a salad, soup or stirfy for dinner? Check the ingredients in your dressing and on the back of the tin as both can contained hidden sugar. 

'Dressings are another potential sugar trap, so take care. There are no real rules, except for being especially careful with lower fat dressing, which can often be higher in sugar to compensate.

'Tomato soups contain a lot of natural sugars, and some added sugar too. Choose a mushroom variety to keep your sugar intake low.'

'Stir-fry sauces are ones to watch – many including this oyster sauce have sugar near the top of the ingredients list,' she continued. 

 When it comes to drinks, coffee addicts and those who reach for flavoured water or ginger beer should watch out. 

'It [coffee] can be a sneaky source of hidden sugar. A syrup-free latte is a good bet as all the sugars come naturally from the milk and don’t harm health.

'And while it may look like water,  Volvic Touch of Fruit actually contains more sugar than the Oasis drink. 

'Ginger beer can be very sugary indeed - more so than Coca Cola, which has 35g per can -  so always go for a diet ginger drink,' she continued.
