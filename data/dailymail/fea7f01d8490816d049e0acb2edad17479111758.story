A mother who struggled to find the energy to play with her son has lost twelve stone and is ready to expand her brood as a result.

Sam Burr, 28, weighed in at 22 stone thanks to her fat-laden diet of fry-ups and 'animal-sized meals'.

The mother-of-one was even told by doctors that she could end up in a wheelchair because her weight was causing problems with her knees.

As she was: Sam, pictured here at 22 stone, blames her weight gain on an unhealthy diet, admitting she would eat out of 'animal sized bowls'

Sam,
 a stay-at-home mother from High Wycombe, started piling on the weight 
when she was 18 years old, reaching 24 stone at her heaviest.

Although she managed to slim down to 13 stone, as soon as she had her first child the weight piled back on.

She said: 'I was so unhappy and of course wanted to lose the
 weight. I knew I had to 
do something that would not only help me to lose weight but also help me
 to keep it off.

'Living on a 
farm didn’t help my diet. I started the day cooking a fry-up for the 
family with lots of greasy bacon and sausages.

'Lunch would generally be a
 sandwich with white bread and more meat and every night I would cook up
 a huge dinner that we ate out of animal-sized bowls.

'After
 I had my son DJ, I knew I had to do something about my size. My 
self-confidence had hit rock bottom, I didn’t want anyone to take my 
photo and I was really ashamed of my body – not even allowing my husband
 to see me in my underwear.

'My health was a real problem as well; I had 
problems with my knees because of my weight with the doctor telling me 
that I could end up in a wheelchair if I didn’t do something about it.'

Through healthy eating, exercise and weight loss supplements from desirablebody.co.uk, Sam lost 12 stone.

Lethargic: The stay-at-home mother said her energy levels were hugely lacking when she overweight and was even told she could end up in a wheelchair

She now has the energy to play with her two-year-old son and even feels ready to expand her family by having another child.

Sam managed to get down to a lean size 12 in time for her wedding day. Sticking to the plan has also allowed her to lose more weight, resulting in her currently weighing in at 10st 7lbs and a slim size 8.

'Losing weight changed my whole life for the better. Not only do I look and feel more attractive but my confidence has improved tenfold - I am now not afraid to have pictures taken of myself or walk around in my underwear in front of my husband - I am proud of my body.

'Even little things, like doing the housework, is so much easier and doesn’t tire me out.

'I would say the best thing about my weight loss is how it has changed my relationship with my family.

'My relationship with my husband David has just got better and better and I am now able to be the mum I want to be and be active for my son - I now give him a run for his money in the energy stakes.

'Losing the weight has even made me ready for another child - I feel like now I am not lugging around all the excess weight my body is ready and healthy to have another baby and make my family even bigger.'
