Floyd Mayweather may already be close to his fighting weight ahead of his bout with Manny Pacquiao next month, but he isn't always eating what you'd expect from a champion.

In a new video released by the champion's 'Money Team', Mayweather's personal chef reveals that he loves his snacks, swapping healthy food for sweets and fizzy drinks on 'snack day'.

'Chef Q' fills two shopping trolleys and spends $321.43 (around £220), as she seeks to make sure she has everything her boss might want.

Mayweather's chef reveals he gets a lot of his energy from eating sweets like Twizzlers on 'snack day'

'Chef Q' told Mayweather's 'Money Team' she usually makes the champ healthy food, but not on snack day

'Although I prepare all these organic healthy meals, today is snack day,' says the chef on camera. 'He loves his snacks!

'He usually snacks on different things, Twizzlers is his favourite thing, sometimes he may want cookies, sometimes he may want chips. 

'Sometimes he just want ice tea. It's just that simple, but we gotta get what he wants, he's the champ.'

As the chef picks up more snacks, including peanut M&Ms and mountains of fizzy drinks, she talks about her role in making Mayweather successful: 'We build champions around here. What would life be like without Kool-aid?'.
