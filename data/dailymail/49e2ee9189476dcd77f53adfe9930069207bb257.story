Missing: Police are looking for a person Sarai Sierra chatted with on the internet before she vanished

Turkish police are looking for a person who chatted with a New York City mother-of-two on social networking sites before she vanished while travelling alone in the country.

Sarai Sierra, 33, has been missing since January 21 when she was supposed to return home to Staten Island from the two-week trip. Turkish police have set up a special unit to find her and her husband and brother have flown to Istanbul to help with the search.

A senior police said that Sierra had exchanged messages with a person before she disappeared and police were now trying to trace the man or woman as a possible suspect in her disappearance.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Sierra 'presumably met' the person after she arrived in Istanbul.

Friends and Sierra's husband, Steven, earlier referred to a person she had spoken to online.

'I am aware of the gentleman she was speaking 
to in the Netherlands,' her husband said before he left for Istanbul. 'He was a tour guide.'

Authorities also revealed that Sarai took trips out of Turkey to travel to Amsterdam and Munich during her two-week vacation.

They are now trying to establish why the photographer, who had never travelled out of the U.S. before, took the trip.

Her husband Steven, from Staten Island, said 
Sierra was in constant contact with him throughout the trip and knew she
had travelled outside Turkey.

Investigation: A Turkish security official leaves the hostel with Sierra's belongings on Tuesday

'These are things she made me well aware
of,' he told Staten Island Live before leaving for Istanbul. 'She kept me 100 percent updated.'

Turkey's Dogan news agency said police had learned that Sierra had travelled
to Amsterdam on January 15 and then on to Munich on January 16, before returning to 
Istanbul on January 19.

Her husband continued: 'Every day while she was there she pretty much kept in
contact with us, letting us know what she was up to, where she was 
going, whether it be through texting or whether it be through video 
chat, she was touching base with us.'

On Tuesday, Turkish police released security camera footage showing the missing mother at a mall near her hostel hours before she disappeared.

No trace: Sarai Sierra, a 33-year-old mother of two young sons, set off for Istanbul January 7 and has since vanished. Her family last heard from her January 21 and she failed to catch her flight home

Apart: Sarai's husband Steven, pictured, said she had told him about her trips to other countries

Sierra can be seen eating lunch and walking through the mall on January 20 - a day before she was supposed to catch a flight back home - according to local reports.

Sarai was supposed to land in the 
U.S. on January 22, but she never arrived. Airline staff at Newark 
Airport told her husband she had never 
boarded her flight.

Her two sons, who are aged 11 and 9, have not been told their mother is missing.

A
police official said authorities have been reviewing footage from 
around Istanbul's Taksim neighborhood - the city's main hub where she 
was staying at a hostel.

Several police teams have also been 
dispatched to surrounding neighborhoods to find possible clues and 
witnesses, the official said.

He spoke on condition of anonymity, 
in line with government rules that bar civil servants from speaking to 
reporters without prior authorization.

Before she went missing, the 
mother-of-two told family members that she planned to take some 
photographs at Galata Bridge, a well-known tourist destination about a 
mile away from Taksim that spans the Golden Horn waterway.

Sierra had planned to go on the trip 
with a friend but ended up going by herself when the friend couldn't 
make it. She was looking forward to exploring her hobby of photography, 
her family said.

She was supposed to begin traveling home and was scheduled to arrive in New York City on Tuesday afternoon.

Her husband, Steven Sierra, waited for
hours at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey on the 22nd
to pick her up. Airline attendants in Turkey said that his wife did not
show up for the flight.

Her belongings, including her 
passport, phone, phone chargers, and medical cards, were found in her room at a hostel in Beyoglu, Turkey. An official said authorities were therefore not able to track her by her cell phone.

The hostel’s 
owner told Turkish authorities that he had last seen her last on Sunday 
night.

Mr Sierra told ABC News that
her behavior is highly unusual, that she seemed perfectly content with her life, and that going off the radar is 
extremely out-of-character for her.

The heartbroken 
husband said that he's been married to her for more than 14 years after meeting her at a church youth group, 
adding that his love for her is ‘deeper than it is for any individual'.

He told WABC: ‘You
have so many thoughts going through your mind, you don’t know what to 
think, you don’t know what to believe, you don’t know what to expect, 
you don’t know what will come out of this.'

Mrs Sierra's friend, Magalena Rodriguez, told the
New York Daily News that the petite woman, who stands at 5ft2in and 
weighs only 110 pounds, has previously fainted without warning.

Ms Rodriguez fears her friend has fainted and could be hurt somewhere in the unfamiliar country.

Crime in Turkey is generally low and 
Istanbul is a relatively safe city for travelers, though there are areas
where women would be advised to avoid going alone at night.

The Galata and the nearby Galata Bridge areas have been gentrified and are home to fish restaurants, cafes and boutiques.
