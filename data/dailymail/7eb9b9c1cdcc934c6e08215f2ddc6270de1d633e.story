The search for a missing toddler turned tragic earlier today when the boy's body was found by police.

The remains of Colton Brandt Turner, 2, of Austin, Texas, were found hidden in a wooded area less than two days after officials received a call from a friend of his mother who was concerned about the young boy's whereabouts.

His mother, 20-year-old Megan Work, is in police custody.

Tragic end: The body of two-year-old Colton turner was found earlier today, and his mother Megan Work is now in police custody (both pictured above)

She is also four months pregnant according to her friend Briana Spieldenner, the same person who initially notified officials. 

'We have every reason to believe the remains of that child are those of little Colton Turner,' Cedar Park Chief of Police Sean Mannix said in a news conference Friday afternoon. 

'We are no longer looking for a missing child in Cedar Park and instead are investigating a death and disposal of a body.'

Work, who is the person of interest in the case, gave officials three different accounts as to where Colton was when asked this week, and none of them checked out.

The young mother had been living out of her car or with friends for the past several months.

Abandoned: Work (above), who is currently four months pregnant, lied to police on three occasions when asked where her son was 

She has, for the moment, been charged with abandoning and endangering a child without intent to return.

Officials believe the child was a victim of abuse according to KXAN. 

In late 2013, Work pleaded guilty to animal cruelty. She also pleaded guilty to assault causing bodily injury stemming from a May 2013 incident where she hit another woman.

Ms. Spieldenner, one of Work's best friends, fought back tears as she talked about what happened, saying, 'She's not who I thought she was.'

She said she had not seen Colton since April, adding, 'He was a happy boy. Always. He was always smiling. He was so happy. My daughter, she like I said she is two and a half, and they loved each other. They would play so good.'

In addition to calling the police, is seems that Ms. Spieldenner was also the one who helped authorities locate Work.

'I just wish I could have done something sooner. I've always been involved in his life and I love him and I l feel like I should have seen something sooner and should have been able to save him,' she told KVUE.

Colton would have turned three in just nine days.
