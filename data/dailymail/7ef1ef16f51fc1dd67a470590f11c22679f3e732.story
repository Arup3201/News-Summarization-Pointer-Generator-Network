The parents of an Atlanta Braves baseball fan who died after he fell 65ft from the upper deck of his team's stadium in Atlanta have blamed the building's design for their son's death.

Ronald Lee Homer Jr. fell six storeys onto a parking lot during a rain delay before a game between the Braves and the Philadelphia Phillies on Monday.

His mother, Connie Homer, said the safety railings at the Braves's Turner Field stadium in Atlanta were only 3½ft high, and her son was about 6½ft tall.

Fatal fall: Ronald Lee Homer Jr. plummeted 65ft to his death from the upper level of stands during an Atlanta Braves game on Monday night in Georgia 

Concerns: Homer's parents say Turner Field Stadium is unsafe and that changes should be made

She said: 'I wouldn't be surprised if he was 
leaning over looking at the cars in the players' parking lot.

'He might have had one or two beers but no more than that,' she
told NBC Atlanta affiliate WXIA, adding, 'He was tight with his money. He's a good guy.'

According to WBSTV, Homer fell from the 400-level upper deck and landed in the players' parking area outside the stadium.

Homer's father, Ronald Homer Sr., told The Associated Press: 'I would like to see the building 
built to prevent something like this happening to another family.

'It should have 
been better engineered from the jump-street when they built that 
stadium.

'This this is going to hurt us for the rest of our life," he said. "When
you lose a kid, not only your kid but your best friend, too, it's bad.'

The Fulton County Medical Examiner on Tuesday said Homer’s death was 
solely the result of blunt force trauma.

The medical examiner’s report 
said further investigation, witness’ accounts and toxicology testing 
would be necessary to determine why Homer fell over the railing.

Witnesses told police no one was standing with Homer when he fell over the upper deck, the Associated Press reported.

Atlanta Police spokesman John Chafee said, 'There is no indication of foul play and the fall appears accidental.'

In a statement on Tuesday, the team said: 'The Atlanta Braves extend our 
sincerest and heartfelt condolences to Mr. Homer's family and friends.

'We are saddened by this tragic incident and will continue our 
investigation along with the Atlanta Police Department.

'We will have no 
further comment until the investigation is complete.

'The Atlanta Braves will observe a moment of silence for Mr. Homer before tonight's game.'

The 30-year-old landscape gardener 
spoke to his mother before his fatal fall to tell her that the game had 
been postponed for two hours because of rain.

Connie Homer said he ended the phone call telling her that loved her.

'He said, "I love you Mom," and I said "I love you too" and that was 
it,' Mrs Homer said in an interview with The Associated Press on Tuesday morning.

'He was big-hearted, just a great guy, very 
respectful,' she said. 'It didn’t matter if they were winning, losing or
what — he’s been a Braves fan forever.'

According to Homer Sr., his son went to see the Braves play a few times a month and never missed a game on TV.

Homer's mother said she’s heard nothing from authorities as to what might have 
caused her son's fall. 

She told The Associated Press her only son was
probably smoking a cigarette while he passed the time of a rain delay.

'I'm just sick,' she said. 'We're a very close family. He was big-hearted.'

Homer, who grew up in Conyers, 
Georgia, graduated in 2001 from Rockdale High School, where he was 
involved in student government, according to his mother.

He was her only son and leaves behind one sister.

There’s no indication of foul play, and the fall appears to have been an accident, Atlanta police spokesman John Chafee said.

An autopsy was planned for Tuesday, the Fulton 
County Medical Examiner’s Office said.

An Atlanta Braves spokeswoman declined to comment on Monday night, referring calls to the Atlanta police.

The tragedy occurred when the game had
just begun after heavy rains caused an almost two-hour delay from the 
scheduled start time at 7.10pm.

At 11pm, police were still at the stadium trying to piece together how Homer fell.

Mr Chafee said witnesses described the
fall as accidental, and added that he was not sure whether wet 
conditions or alcohol had contributed.

'At this time there's no indication of foul play and the fall appears accidental,' Mr Chafee.

'It appears he fell from an upper-level platform to a secured lot below.'

This wasn't the first accident of its kind to happen at Turner Field, and was the third time a
sports fan has fallen from the stands in Atlanta in about a year.

Ballgame falls: Several falls in sports stadiums have troubled Georgia recently, such as Isaac Grubb's fatal fall at the Georgia Dome

In May 2008, a 25-year-old man from Cumming, Georgia, suffered head injuries when 
he fell down a stairwell at Turner Field during a game against the New 
York Mets. He later died.

Police found that alcohol had factored into 
that accident, which the Braves said was the first non-medical fatality 
to happen at the ballpark.

Isaac Grubb, 20, of Lenoir City, 
Tennessee, died after falling over a railing at the Georgia Dome during a
football game between Tennessee and North Carolina State on August 31, 
2012.

Authorities said he landed on another man seated in the lower level, and that alcohol was a factor.

A man fell about 25ft over a staircase railing at a Georgia Tech-Miami football game on September 22, 2012 and was not seriously injured.

Turner Field became the home of the Braves in 1997, a year after serving as the site of major events for the 1996 Summer Olympics.
