Accused: Kent Police Superintendent Rachel Adams has been arrested on suspicion of shoplifting

A senior police officer has been accused of stealing make-up worth £30 from Asda.

Superintendent Rachel Adams, 46, was allegedly spotted taking the items from the shelves before trying to walk off without paying for them.

She was challenged by staff about the alleged shoplifting before being arrested at her home hours later.

She is accused of stealing make-up and cosmetics from the Asda store in Kings Hill, near Maidstone, Kent, on August 27.

The superintendent is understood to be denying the offence.

She has not been charged and is on bail until October 11, pending further inquiries.

Miss Adams, who became the area commander of Medway in Kent last year, has been suspended from her job.

She has also stepped down as vice-chairman of the Medway Community Safety Partnership which was set up in 1998 to tackle crime and anti-social behaviour.

She joined Kent Police in her 20s after serving in the military, rising through the ranks to become one of the county's most senior women officers on a salary of around £65,000. Her job is being filled by a female colleague during her suspension.

The commander previously worked as a detective chief inspector before being made support officer to the chief constable of Kent, based in Maidstone.

She was promoted to deputy area commander for West Kent in 2010 and in June last year was given the commander's job for Medway – putting her in charge of policing a 263,000 population.

Speaking after being given the deputy commander's post in 2010, she said: 'The public are what matters. The way we conduct our business must include the fundamental issue of standards and ethical policing. This should be the common thread throughout our service and how we deliver it.'

Speaking last year in her role as the 
vice-chair of the Medway Community Safety Partnership, she said: 'Crime 
and anti-social behaviour is steadily falling, and all of the partners 
work tirelessly to ensure the continuing safety of Medway residents.'

A spokesman for Kent Police said: 'On Monday, August 27, a 46-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of theft in Kings Hill.

'She was later released on police bail until October 11. The Kent Police officer has been suspended from duty.'

Councillor Mike O’Brien, chairman of the Medway Community Safety Partnership, said: 'The role of the vice-chair of the Medway Community Safety Partnership is automatically taken on by the police officer who has overall responsibility for policing command in Medway.

'If a person is not currently working in that role, they are unable to sit as the vice-chair of the partnership.

'As this is an ongoing policing enquiry, we are unable to comment any further.'

Police community support officer Shane
Alborough, 27, has been found guilty of stealing a jumbo-sized 
Toblerone from a Tesco store.

The PCSO from Romford, Essex, was seen stuffing the chocolate bar into his stab vest.

A judge at Snaresbrook Crown Court ordered him to do 200 hours' unpaid work and pay £600 costs.

Fellow PCSO James Nouchin, 31, of Ilford, Essex, was cleared of two counts of theft.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
