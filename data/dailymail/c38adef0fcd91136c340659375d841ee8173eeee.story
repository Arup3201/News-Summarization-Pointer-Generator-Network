Her Midas touch was credited with boosting the fortunes of Marks & Spencer earlier this week.

Now Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, the Devon born model, has helped another British firm to beat the financial blues.

Luxury fashion retailer Burberry, which has used Miss Huntington-Whiteley as both a model and ambassador around the world, cheered the City with a better than expected sales performance yesterday.

The 25-year-old was unveiled as the face of the new perfume brand the Burberry Body earlier this year, with marketing shots showing her wearing a trademark trench coat and nothing else.

Earlier this week retail giant Marks and Spencer hailed the model’s luxury ‘Rosie’ lingerie range as a major success.

Her underwear collection was the fastest selling in the group’s history and the one shining element from a set of distinctly grey  sales statistics from M&S.

Miss Huntington-Whiteley’s relationship with Burberry has worked remarkably well for both parties since the fashion label’s chief creative director, Christopher Bailey, first picked her as the face of the brand in 2008.

The decision gave the young blonde, who grew up on a farm in Tavistock, Devon, an international profile and helped to win her first British Vogue cover in the same year.

The 25-year-old has maintained her ties with Burberry ever since and is now considered one the world’s most sought after and highest paid models.

While her fame also opened the door 
to acting roles in the third Transformers film and the new version of 
Mad Max, which is currently in production.

Explaining
the decision to choose her to front the Burberry Body fragrance 
campaign, Mr Bailey said: ‘Rosie’s effortless style and her staggering 
beauty made her the natural choice.’

The global economic slowdown has caught up with luxury brands in the past year with sales failing to grow in line with expectations.

In Britain, both Burberry and Mulberry have suffered at time when even the burgeoning middle classes in China have scaled back their purchases of international designer labels.

However, Burberry yesterday announced underlying profits for the six months to the end of September were up by six per cent year on a year ago to £173million. This was ahead of City expectations of around £162m.

The group, which is best known for its signature camel, red and black check pattern, said total sales were up eight per cent to £883 million. 

Its profit margin was also up slightly because it was selling more products at the top end of its luxury price bracket.

Burberry has decided to bring its beauty products and fragrance business, which had previously been farmed out to a third party, back under the control of the company. This will involve paying a hefty fee of some £145million.

The firm hopes the Burberry Body fragrance and the association with the British model will be a huge money spinner in the run-up to Christmas and beyond.

Chief executive, Angela Ahrendts, said: ‘We see huge potential in this category,’ adding that the products would be presented in a way that was ‘much more linked into the fashion calendar’.

Stacey Cartwright, the chief financial officer, said the fragrances and beauty products are important because they offer women a relatively affordable introduction to the brand.

A small 35ml bottle of the Burberry Body eau de toilette sells for £39.

It is also expecting strong sales of its new version of The Orchard bag, as seen on the arms of A-list celebrities such as Sarah Jessica Parker and Emma Stone.

A Nubuck leather option comes in at £1,295.

Retail analyst, Kate Calvert, of Seymour Pierce, described the sales figures and profits as ‘reassuring’, while she predicted strong long-term growth.
