As introductions go it was a little 
prickly between Lily the kitten and Lucy the hedgehog when they met 
recently for the first time.

The 15-month-old African pygmy hedgehog was a new arrival at the home of owner – and YouTuber - Mamoth100 on Friday.

Her eight-month-old ragdoll cat has starred in several YouTube videos already on account of her inquisitive nature and so Mamoth100 set up a formal introduction between the pair of pets on the couch and filmed the whole thing on her cell phone.

Lily's curiosity got the better of her and she tried to check out the new arrival by putting her paw on Lucy but then she hastily retreated after getting a slight prick

Next Lily tries a different tact when she attempts to sit on Lucy - you can guess what happens next...

Lily’s curiosity got the better of her first and she tried to check out the new arrival by putting her paw on Lucy but after getting a slight prick she retreated.

Next she tried a different tact which consisted of attempting to sit on Lucy. You can guess what happens next, although it is still hilarious to watch as Lily shots of at super-fast speed.

Lily then retires to a safe distance to re-valuate if the new arrival is really a friend or foe. Once they’ve worked out their differences I’m sure the pair will get along just fine.

The owner’s video has gone viral since it was posted on Friday and has quickly attracted more than 300,000 views.
