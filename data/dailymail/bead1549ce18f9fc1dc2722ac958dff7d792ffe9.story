Manny Pacquiao has called on Floyd Mayweather Jnr to be aggressive in their $300million (£200m) super-fight, because his previous victories have sent the Filipino star to sleep.

Pacquiao and Mayweather will come face-to-face in Los Angeles on Wednesday night at the only press conference before fight week.

And after reports that Mayweather dropped a sparring partner last weekend, Pacquiao hopes his rival throws caution to the wind on May 2.

'I hope the reports are true,' Pacquiao told CBS. 'He should be aggressive during our fight so we can make the fans happy. 

'We all know how he fights. In fact, his previous fights lulled me to sleep. I hope this time he would be man enough to take some risks. 

'He should prove to the world that he's a fearless fighter, not a runner.'

Pacquiao will make the short trip from his Hollywood gym to the press conference as his training continues under the watchful eye of Freddie Roach.

Roach arrived on Sunday after overseeing Zou Shiming's world title defeat in Macau the day before.
