Preserved for thousands of years, the ancient mummies of Egypt have literally kept their secrets under wraps - until now.

Thanks to a new exhibition at the British Museum, the public can finally gain a glimpse into what lies beneath after eight mummies underwent CAT scans at London hospitals, proving the most detailed picture yet of our Egyptian forbears.

Ancient Lives: New Discoveries, which opens on May 22, reveals that despite the separation of centuries, the Egyptians suffered from the same health issues that plague us today, including high cholesterol, fatty diets and bad toothache.

Unwrapped: Eight mummies from the British Museum, like the one shown, revealed their secrets after undergoing CAT scans

One even sported a tattoo of the Archangel Michael on her inner thigh.

John 
Taylor, head curator of the British Museum's Ancient Egypt and Sudan 
department, said: 'We want to promote the idea these are not objects, but
 real human beings.

'We want to capture the humanity of these people.'

The mummies came from all walks of life, from royalty to ordinary people living along the Nile.

They also lived during different eras - the oldest tested is more than 5,500 years old and dates back to 3,500 BC, while the most recent lived around 1,300 years ago.

Some were just youngsters when they died, at around two years of age, while others lived to see their 50th birthday.

Using CAT scans, also known as computer tomography, scientists were able to build up a three-dimensional picture of the ancient remains.

Some of the bodies were so well preserved that the scan revealed bones, tissue and vital organs.

Scientists combined the CAT scan images with carbon dating and infra-red 'reflectography' to build up a detailed picture of their lives.

Scans of the pelvic areas also helped the team work out their ages by looking at the wear and tear on their bones.

Secrets revealed: CAT scans, like the one pictured, showed how the ancient Egyptians lived, what ailments they suffered and their dietary habits

Two of the eight mummies tested were found to have a build-up in their legs of plaque - essentially cholesterol, calcium and tissue - suggesting they suffered from heart problems.

This can be caused by a rich diet high in fat, or it can be genetic.

Many experienced poor dental health and had multiple abscesses, which if left untreated, may have led to inflammation of the throat, asphyxiation and ultimately death.

Analysis of digestive remains suggested the Egyptians enjoyed a wide diet that included fish, a little meat, beer, bread and sugar-rich fruits, such as dates.

One female mummy, aged between 20 and 35 and found in Sudan in 2005, sported a tattoo on her right leg.

Exhibition curator Daniel Antoine, who also curates the museum's physical anthropology department, said: 'The tattoo on her right inner thigh represents a monogram that spells Michael in ancient Greek.

'She is the first evidence of a tattoo from this period. This is a very rare find.'

The tattoo represents the symbol of the Archangel Michael and one theory suggests it may have provided the owner, who lives in AD 700, with spiritual 'protection'.
