It is regarded as the single finest car built by Aston Martin in the famous firm's 99-year history.

So it is little wonder that this spectacular model - winner of the 1959 Le Mans 24-hour race - is set to become the most expensive British car ever.

Built in 1957, the immaculate Aston Martin DBR1/2  went on sale yesterday for a staggering £20million.

Iconic: This classic Aston Martin regarded as one of the finest cars of all time, has been put up for sale for a British record £20million

Racing engine: The 1957 sports car, which has been raced its entire life and meticulously maintained, has now come onto the market for the first time in years

The green two-seater is the company's most successful racing car ever, dominating motorsport in the late-1950s and the only Aston Martin to take the chequered flag at Le Mans.

Yesterday an expert on the marque who saw its triumph over 50 years ago said it was 'a joy' to see its current state and that the massive price tag was no surprise.

If a buyer can meet the asking price, it will be four times the previous record for the public sale of a British car, an iconic 1929 Bentley which fetched £5million at auction in June.

The Aston Martin is being sold by Ascot-based Ferrari specialists Talacrest, who also handled the purchase by the present owner - who has not been named - 20 years ago.

Founder John Collins described it as 'the holy grail of motoring' and 'the most recognisable and valuable Aston Martin in history'.

'I would say it is one of the top five cars in the world, and models of this calibre and undisputed provenance are rarely available on the open market,' he added.

'It is road registered so you can just jump in it and drive it to the local shops.

'It is one of the most successful and instantly recognisable historic racing cars in the world today and has undisputed provenance and is ready to race.'

Spectacular: Despite its age Aston Martin historian Brian Joscelyne said 'It handles so well and can slide around corners in spectacular fashion'

Success: Victories at Le Mans and Goodwood in the late 1950s makes this car one of the most iconic in motor sports

Designated DBR1/2 as it was the second of four DBR1s to be completed, its honours also include victory in the 1957 Spa 1,000 km race.

The DBR1/2 is the single most successful racing car ever built by Aston Martin.

After its victorious debut at the 1957 Spa 1000 km race, it scored five more victories.

Most important of all was the win in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1959 in the hands of Roy Salvadori and Carroll Shelby.

This high point in Aston's history came in 1959 but there was also a big victory in what was one of Sir Stirling Moss's greatest races in the Goodwood Tourist Trophy.

The model is called the Aston Martin DBR1 and the /2 denotes the second of four factory models.

A fifth DBR1 was built for a private handler.DBR stands for David Brown Racing, with David Brown the businessman who owned Aston Martin.

Sir Stirling Moss was driving it when he won the RAC Tourist Trophy at Goodwood in 1958 and 1959.

But its 1959 Le Mans triumph with Carroll Shelby and Roy Salvadori behind the wheel was its finest moment, reaching speeds in excess of 160mph.

In recent years it has continued to be raced regularly, while being meticulously maintained.

Aston Martin historian Brian Joscelyne, who was watching from the pit lane, said yesterday: 'It is a joy whenever I see the car because it means so much to me.

'The Aston Martins ended up coming first and second and at last, after all their hard work, Aston Martin had finally got there and won Le Mans. It was a very emotional moment for everyone.

'They were so far ahead of the next Ferrari that they could have pulled over, had a wash and a meal and still comfortably beaten won.'

And he added: 'The car has been very well looked after and has had very good owners.

'It handles so well and with the right drivers can slide around corners in spectacular fashion.

'This is the model to have, it is an astonishing all-round car.'

The most expensive car ever sold is thought to be a Ferrari 250GTO also driven by Sir Stirling which fetched $35million (£22million) earlier this year.

Domination: During its period of success it dominated the Ferraris and Jaguars of its day and is the only Aston Martin to ever win Le Mans

Retired: Upon winning the 1959 championship, David Brown announced Aston Martin's withdrawal from the Sportscar Championship

Pricey: The £20m price tag will make it one of the most expensive cars of all time
