The BBC’s controversial creative director Alan Yentob has been removed from the corporation’s management board.

Mr Yentob, who also works as a presenter for the broadcaster, is among a host of executives who have been taken off the group which is charged with directly managing the BBC.

It is part of new director general George Entwistle’s attempts to streamline the BBC and make it more efficient.

Changes at the top: Imagine presenter and senior BBC executive Alan Yentob, who has been dropped from the corporation's management board

He has replaced the former BBC Direction Group, which had 22 executives on it to just a dozen top bosses on its new ‘management board’, which will ensure the ‘effective running of the whole organisation’.

This means Mr Yentob will lose his seat the at inner-circle of decision making at the BBC.

While he will still report directly to the director general he will be told to focus on his main job of maintaining creativity in the broadcaster’s output.

Other executives, who have been taken off the board include the head of its in-house production arm Pat Younge, as well as its strategy chief and its chief technology officer.

Alan Yentob, whose total pay last year was £183,000, is described as ‘the focal point for talent management across the whole of the BBC’.  He also has responsibility for its film division and chairs the board of BBC Films.

Mr Yentob, who joined the BBC in 1968 and is one of its most high profile executives, is also paid separately for his work as a presenter on BBC1’s arts series Imagine.

In his first speech to staff last week Mr Entwistle explained the change. He said: ‘This morning I held the first meeting of the BBC’s new Management Board.

‘This smaller team, replacing BBC Direction Group and reduced in number from around 25 to just 12 people, will be responsible for the effective running of the whole organisation.

‘I’ve asked everyone on the board to ensure they work in the interests of the broader BBC in all the decisions they take.’

The newly created management board is responsible for ‘managing pan-BBC issues’ which are delegated to it from the corporation’s executive board. It meets three times a month.

Mr Entwistle is determined to tackle inefficiency and waste at the broadcaster and make sure as much money as possible is spent on programming. As part of this he is expected to push even harder to cut the number of senior managers at the organisation.

In 2010 Mr Yentob came close to leaving his executive role at the BBC as bosses looked at axing his post of creative director as part of a cull on executive pay, which also saw the deputy director general role removed - but he stayed.

Cost cutter: New director general George Entwistle is attempting to streamline the broadcaster and make it more efficient as it tries to deal with a freeze in funding

In the past the BBC’s creative director has attracted criticism for his expenses claims.

On one occasion he sparked controversy when he claimed he would not be able to work properly without flying business class at licence fee payers’ expense.

He had justified a £3,381 return trip to New York in business class by saying that without it, he ‘wouldn’t have been capable of doing the job’.

Mr Yentob has over the years been seen as a poster boy for the highly paid executive culture at the corporation.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘George Entwistle has created a radically simplified management team specifically designed to ensure it can take decisions quickly and efficiently. Its focus is threefold, the creative output of the BBC, its staff and its finances.’

‘The individuals on the management board are divisional leaders with direct managerial and fiscal responsibilities.

‘As Creative Director of the BBC, Alan’s role does not encompass these duties which is why he is not on the new board. He will, however, continue to report directly to the Director-General and will play a key role in exploring new ways of developing high quality creative content across the BBC.’
