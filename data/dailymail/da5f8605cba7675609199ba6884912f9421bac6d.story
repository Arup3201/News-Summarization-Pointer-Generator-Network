The monsters that haunt children's nightmares have been bought vividly to life by an imaginative French photographer. The images show children battling giant, sharp-toothed creatures – but with a twist.

The terrifying monsters, with sharp claws and big eyes, seem to be afraid of the children as they cower in the corners of the youngsters' bedrooms.

Armed with sticks, wands and swords the eight- and nine-year-olds gain the upper-hand against the villains.

Parisian photographer Laure Fauvel, 22, said: 'I wanted the children not to be victims and to fight the monsters. I wanted the monsters to fear the children.'

Fauvel, who began the project in March, asked friends and family to pose for the shoot and used their own bedrooms to inject their personality into the photos.

She then doctored images of real animals - such as rhinos and monkeys - to create the beasts. And she even drew from her own fear of spiders for one creepy creature.

But the children showed no fear during the shoot. She added: 'I asked them to imagine a monster but because they're children it was just a game for them.'
