Filippo Inzaghi has taken full responsibility for AC Milan's torrid first half of the season, but remains positive that he is the man to turn things around at the San Siro.

The Milan coach has guided his side to just six wins in their opening 19 matches, and they sit in a lowly eighth place in Serie A. 

Inzaghi, though, was honest in his assessment of the season so far:

Filippo Inzaghi's AC Milan have struggled so far this season, and sit seven points off the Champions League

On Sunday, Milan were beaten 1-0 at home by Atalanta, leaving them in eighth place in Serie A

'I take the blame and we will try and turn the whistles into cheers,' he told the club's official website.

'Everything is up for discussion when you lose. We have to understand what isn't working and find a solution.'

Milan narrowly beat Sassuolo last Tuesday, but before that have to look back to mid-December to find their last win.

On Sunday, the Rossoneri were beaten at home by Atalanta, leaving them seven points adrift of third-placed Napoli in the final Champions League spot.

'It's not a question to do with the formation,' Inzaghi continued, 'but rather playing with heart and desire. We have to wake up quickly and get back to doing what we have been doing.

'We have many fans and we cannot play like that. We have to roll our sleeves up.'
