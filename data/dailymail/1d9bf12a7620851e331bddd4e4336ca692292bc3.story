Missouri teen Martez Young-Caldwell faces child pornography charges as police say he skipped class with two other students only to film them in 'a sexual act' in a high school hallway.

The Normandy High School junior allegedly encouraged a girl, 15, and boy, 16, to engage in the act with one another while he filmed it on his cell phone, even turning the camera to show his own face at one point.

'It’s just the best evidence you can have; a
 picture of him, filming, and showing himself on the film,' Wellston Police Chief G. Thomas Walker told Fox 2 Now.

The incident allegedly happened June 3rd, and just 24 hours later Normandy security had confiscated the phone while Young-Caldwell admitted his role to investigators. 

The admission lacked an understanding of just how severe the charges were, Walked said.

'In his thinking, 15, 16, 17, they’re 
all the same, and I think right now we’re living in a culture where 
everybody wants to put everything on YouTube, and you just can’t do 
that. And this was a situation where it obviously was a clear-cut 
violation of the law,' he said.

He is being held on $25,000 bond and has been formally charged with Promoting Child Pornography in the 2nd Degree. 

'The people involved were not the only ones that saw it and that 
would constitute the promoting of child pornography, by showing it to 
someone else,' Walker said. 'The word got around to security, and 
they immediately investigated.'

The Normandy School District has yet to determine what if any action will be taken to discipline the students who were filmed

It's still uncertain whether the school will discipline the students Walker filmed.

'We are reviewing the 
alleged incident. Disciplinary action will be based on our policies and 
procedures,' said Normandy School District 
Spokesperson Daphne Dorsey.

Until the school year's final day on June 12th, police announced they will have n increased presence on campus to prevent similar occurrences.
