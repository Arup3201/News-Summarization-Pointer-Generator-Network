Rosie O'Donnell has lashed out and savaged her former friend Stephen Collins and described how her own sex abuse as a child scarred her for life.

In a lengthy blog post written in halting poetic style, O'Donnell condemned the '7th Heaven' star for his confession, saying it betrayed a 'casual lack of accountability.'

'u are not equals/ she was an innocent child/ a baby girl/ u have a daughter for gods sake/ were u able to resist the urge to touch her ?/ how noble ...' O'Donnell writes.

Rosie O'Donnell blasted former friend Stephen Collins for his 'casual lack of accountability' after he confessed to sexually abusing thee girls

He admitted in a 20/20 interview last week that he inappropriately touched three girls - though says he never molested them. 

O'Donnell compared the Collins to Bill Cosby - who is accused of raping several women, charges that he denies. She called Collins a pedophile. 

She also scolded Katie Couric for not being harder on him in his tell-all interview last week. 

Collins, 67, described in an interview how he molested a 10-year-old girl in 1973.

Rosie pointed out that she was also 10 in 1973. And then shared how her own sexual abuse left her hating her body and hating sex. 

'in case u wonder/ what ur man sized penis –ur abuse of power/ ur lack of impulse control did to that kid/ i will tell u a bit about me,' she wrote. 

Katie Couric also came in for criticism from O'Donnell, who said the interviewer did not expose Collins for what he really is

 'sex is not funnot now/ not ever/ it is married to a lingering terror/ joy evaporated

'my body became my enemy/ i would not love i/ ttake care of it/ treat it well

'it had betrayed me/ caused such pain and humiliation/ i did not want 2 feel2 know.'

O'Donnell described how she met Collins in 1997 and quickly became friends with him. He taught her transcendental meditation, which she still uses today.

She also took Couric to task, saying that the broadcaster didn't press Collins hard enough when she interviewed him.   

'katie couric was r guest/ i was sure she was gonna do 2 him/ what she did 2 sarah palin/ hit him with his truth,' O'Donnell writes. 

'right between the eyes/ expose him for who he was/ 'what newspapers do u read sarah?'/ she saved us all then/ this time/ she didn’t.'
