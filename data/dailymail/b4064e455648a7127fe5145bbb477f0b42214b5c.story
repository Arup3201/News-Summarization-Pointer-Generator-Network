Jeb Bush has hired Ethan Czahor as his campaign's chief technology officer

Shortly after it emerged that Jeb Bush had hired Ethan Czahor as his campaign's chief technology officer, the Hipster.com co-founder set out to do some spring cleaning on his Twitter.

But it was already too late to discreetly delete a handful of 'jokes' the Santa Monica product manager had made where he calls out 'sl**s' and frets about gay guys at the gym.

Buzzfeed reports that after it was reported the former Florida governor had hired Czahor to work for his political action committee, Right to Rise, dozens of tweets disappeared from Czahor's timeline. 

'New study confirms old belief: college female art majors are sl**s, science majors are also sl**s but uglier,' one deleted tweet read, with an expired link.

Other deleted tweets include a couple gay panic jokes Czahor made about working out at the gym.

'when i burp in the gym i feel like it's my way of saying, "sorry guys, but i'm not gay,"' another said. 

The Bush camp told Czahor to delete the tweets  around the time his hire was announced, according to a spokesperson.

Chief Comedy Officer: A handful of tweets riffing on sexist and homophobic themes disappeared from Ethan Czahor's feed after it was announced he was joining Jeb Bush's presidential campaign

Brogrammer: One of the more popular tweets Czahor kept was about branding a probiotics for men as 'brobiotics' 

'Governor Bush believes the comments were inappropriate,' the spokesperson told BuzzFeed. 'They have been deleted at our request. Ethan is a great talent in the tech world and we are very excited to have him on board the Right to Rise PAC.' 

Czahor, part of the GOP's bid to raise the party's tech-savvy, developed the site jebspeech.com ahead of Bush's speech to the Detroit Economic Club on Wednesday.

Time reports a message was found in the website's code soliciting resumes for Right to Rise, because nothing says cool like leaving secret messages for Time to discover. 

Old beliefs: Czahor calls college women sl**s in one deleted tweet that accompanies a now expired shortened link

Inappropriate: Bush reportedly believed the jokes were 'inappropriate,' though the spokesperson called Czahor a 'great talent'

Gym ettiquete: At least two tweets referenced gay people working out in the gym with Czahor

Not gay: This tweet disappeared along with dozens of others on the request of former Governor Jeb Bush, a spokesperson confirmed

Czahor's Linkedin profile lists him as the chief technology officer at Hipster.com, a startup that went through several iterations during its short life.

The now-deleted tweets were presumably up on Czahor's Twitter when AOL acquired Hipster.com in 2012 - and promptly killed it a month later.

TechCrunch notes that during Czahor's time as CTO, Hipster.com was criticized because the app uploaded a 'big chunk' of contacts off a users' iPhone and onto the company's servers. 

Inappropriate: Bush reportedly believed the jokes were 'inappropriate,' though the spokesperson called Czahor a 'great talent'

Now deleted: Apart from sexist passes at jokes, Czahor deleted duds about drunk driving signs and disaster relief

Gone: This tweet was dumped, though tweets like 'the super bowl is indeed super, but i find nothing worldly about the world series' live on in Czahor's timeline

Before Bush, Czahor served as CTO at Ready to Win, a for-profit launched by former J Crew CEO Dick Boyce aimed at strengthening Republican technological properties ahead of 2016.

Boyce, who has tried to close the tech gap between Republicans and Democrats, also founded Liberty Works, which closed shop in June 2013 about a month after it was announced the GOP would use it to build its data platform, Huffington Post reported.

After the Buzzfeed story, Czahor tried to tweet an explanation for his recent deletion spree, saying 'i deleted some old jokes i made years ago i no longer find funny or appropriate #learning #maturing.'
