Google is to unveil a smaller, cheaper Android rival to Apple's iPad as early as May - made in partnership with tablet-maker Asus.

The tablet could sell for as little as Â£130, and will have a seven-inch screen, according to a leak reported in Digitimes.

The device would be a competitor to Amazon's Kindle Fire - and like Fire, would be built to sell content such as video and music via Google's own online store.

Asus's hit EEEPad - the tablet maker is said to be developing a seven-inch tablet in collaboration with Google which would carry both Asus and Google branding

Google recently rebranded its Android Marketplace as Google Play, streamlining services such as its video store, ebook store and app marketplace, so the timing would make sense.

Google already offers similar Google-branded smartphones, made in collaboration with Samsung.

Leaks from hi-tech suppliers in the Far East had already hinted that a small, cheap Android 'entertainment tablet' might be released in the first half of this year.

In
an interview with Italian newspaper Corriere della Serra, Google 
executive chairman Eric Schmidt reportedly said, 'In the next six 
months, we plan to market a tablet of the highest quality.'

Apple is rumoured to be working on an 'iPad Mini' with a similar form factor, according to analyst reports, which could appear in the third quarter this year.

Apple CEO Tim Cook launched the new iPad last week. Google's device would not compete directly with the high-end, hi-tech device

Digitimes reports that Google spoke to other tablet companies such as HTC before deciding on Asus.

Asus makes the hit EEE Pad Transformer, one of the most distinctive Android devices, and was showing off a seven-inch tablet at CES.

'Asustek's motivation for cooperating with Google is to win Google's confidence to facilitate development of its Android-based devices, learn Google's technology to develop software and content, as well as enter the tablet US market,' said Digitimes.
