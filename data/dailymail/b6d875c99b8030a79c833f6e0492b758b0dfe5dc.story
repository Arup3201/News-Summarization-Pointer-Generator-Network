Cornered: Hani Nicham Abou El Kheir was knifed 30 times for living on the wrong side of the street

A gang who stabbed and hacked a schoolboy to death with knives, swords and a meat cleaver because he lived on the wrong side of the street was yesterday jailed for a total of 131 years.

Hani Hicham Abou El Kheir, 16, died after being knifed 30 times when the hooded gang of up to ten people pounced on him wielding a ‘fearsome armoury’ in a ‘calculated and savage’ attack yards from multi-million pound homes.

He was hunted down and shot with a Taser stun gun before being stabbed through the heart and left for dead.

Arber Barbatovci, 20, Ahmed Mikhaimar, 20, Tarquai Joseph, 19, and a fourth man, aged 20, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum of 26 years each.

A fifth member of the gang, Craig Boyce, 26, was told he would spend at least 27 years behind bars. The Old Bailey heard that the ‘chilling’ murder, which happened on a Sunday in Pimlico, an affluent area of Central London where Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has a home, was the result of a bitter rivalry between two street gangs in a ‘turf war’ over drugs.

Police blamed Hani’s slaughter on ‘the casual acceptance of knives among young people’ in London. But his broken-hearted mother insisted her son had nothing to do with gangs and died simply because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time.

On January 27 last year, Hani was walking home with his girlfriend through an estate in Pimlico at the centre of the turf war when he was spotted by the gang, who were wearing balaclavas, hats and scarves.

They chased him into an alleyway 
where he was ‘butchered’ in such a frenzied ambush that two of the 
killers suffered cuts as they rained down blows on the helpless 
schoolboy. The mob then scattered and dumped their weapons in a drain. 
Hani died later in hospital.

Prosecutor
 Aftab Jafferjee QC said: ‘An agenda of murderous proportion was at play
 that evening by way of simply which side of a street they lived on. His
 murder was the produce of brazen lawlessness on the streets of Central 
London on a Sunday evening.’

Hani’s
 mother, Pauline Hickey, said he was a recluse who suffered from anxiety
 attacks and had only just started venturing out on his own  and making 
friends in the last few weeks of his life.

In
 a moving statement, she said: ‘Hani was my only child. I pine for him 
every day and I cannot come to terms with the fact that I will never 
again see his warm, beautiful smile or his awkward walk or hear his 
childish voice and explosive laugh, the way he said “Mum” constantly and
 told me he loved me every day, the mess he left his bedroom and his 
heavy hugs.

‘Hani was a 
gentle and loving giant. Every day I expect him to come through the 
front door. I cannot face the truth of Hani’s death and I cannot get 
over the devastating image of my son lying dead in the hospital.’

She said she would have given her life to save her son.

‘It
 has left me feeling so much guilt for not being there to help him when 
he was butchered by that gang as he tried to run home to me,’ she added.
 ‘Hani was not involved with any gangs and had never been arrested or 
involved with the police in any way.

‘It could have been anyone who was murdered that night; Hani was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.’

The court heard that his killers had a catalogue of previous convictions.

The
 defendant who cannot be named was convicted in 2010 of affray after an 
18-year-old boy was attacked on a bus near Victoria station.

Mikhaimar,
 of Pimlico, has convictions for burglary, while Barbatovci, also from 
Pimlico, has a record that includes affray and possession of a knife. 
Boyce, of Paddington, West London has committed 23 offences of vandalism
 and assault.

Horrific: The 16-year-old died from multiple stab wounds after he was set upon on the edge of Pimlico

Grieving: Family members including Hani's mother Pauline Hickey, pictured with her hood up, lay flowers next to the scene where he was stabbed

Joseph, of 
Maida Vale, West London, has been convicted of abusing two police 
workers, attempted robbery and grievous bodily harm. All five had denied
 murder but they were convicted unanimously by a jury.

Judge Charles Wide QC, told them: ‘The murder by you of Hani Hicham Abou El Kheir was as calculated as it was savage.

‘The horror of what you did is demonstrated and compounded by the degree of planning and organisation.

‘You
 had a fearsome armoury of long knives and meat cleavers and then a 
co-ordinated meet after which you moved together through the streets to 
find your victim, hunt him down and kill him. He must have been utterly 
terrified as he was chased by you and utterly terrified when, 
outnumbered, the blows rained down.’

A
 sixth man, Yassine Sidi-Ammi, 20, was cleared of perverting the course 
of justice, while another man, Dilwar Hussein, has fled to Bangladesh.

Donjeta
 Gashi, 20, of Kentish Town, North-West London, was found guilty of 
perverting the course of justice. She will be sentenced later.

Police are offering a £20,000 reward for information about others involved in the murder.

Detective
 Chief Inspector Neil Attewell said: ‘It is the casual acceptance of 
knives amongst young people that has led to the needless loss of yet 
another young person in London.’
