A beach walker has unearthed a 7ft (2.1 metre) fossil of a fierce marine monster in south Wales.

Jonathan Bow, 34, stumbled upon the complete 200 million-year-old ichthyosaur remains while walking along the Penarth shoreline.

The computer programmer and his brother spent a full day digging up the 132lb (60kg) fossil, which Mr Bow described as 'a whopper'.

Jonathan Bow, 34, found the complete 200 million-year-old ichthyosaur remains while walking in Penarth area

Now Mr Bow has replaced the coffee table in his home with the fossil of the carnivorous icthyosaur to show off his find to friends and family.

Ichthyosaurs, also known as fish lizards - despite being neither fish nor lizards - were reptiles that swam the world's oceans in the Jurassic period while dinosaurs walked the land. 

They died out around 25 million years before the extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs and were replaced by plesiosaurs, a long neck marine reptile

'It was a particularly low tide and we were just leaving after failing to find anything interesting,' said Mr Bow.

Ichthyosaurs, also known as fish lizards, were reptiles that swam the world's oceans in the Jurassic period while dinosaurs walked the land. 

The species varied from 3.3ft (1 metre) to over 52ft (16 metres) in length. They looked similar to dolphins with some species posessing a dorsal fin. Their heads were pointed, and their jaws were often equipped with conical teeth to catch smaller prey

These fish lizards are thought to have evolved from an as yet unidentified land reptile that moved back into the water. They quickly became streamlined, and one species had a cruising speed of 22mph (36 km/h).

'Then something caught the corner of my eye and when I investigated I couldn't believe it - it was an incredible find.'

While complete remains of ichthyosaurs have been discovered in Dorset and elsewhere, this is the first time a full specimen of the lizard has been found in Wales.

The stone around the skeleton had to be carefully removed before Mr Bow alerted experts at National Museum Wales.

The fossil hunter still has about 100 hours of patient work on the specimen in his workshop at his home in Porthcawl before it is ready to be displayed.

'Something this large and complete is a once in a lifetime find. It was quite a whopper.' He said.

'Anyone walking their dog on the beach could have found it - it just fell to me to be lucky.'

Mr Bow has also discovered part of a jaw of a plesiosaur since he started his hobby several years ago.

National Museum Wales palaeontologist Cindy Howells said: 'The ichthyosaur is potentially a very, very important find because it is so complete.'

The incredible fossil was found on a beach in Penarth - a town in the Vale of Glamorgan, South Wales
