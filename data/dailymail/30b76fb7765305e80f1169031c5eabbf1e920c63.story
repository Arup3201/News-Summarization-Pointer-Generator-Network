Relaxation classes are usually the answer for stressed-out mothers and city workers who seek solace from the stresses and strains of everyday life.

But now, the chill-out classes are opening their doors to a new genre of clientele: pre-school children.

The sessions, which are held at the Lev Inspire centre in Levenshulme, aim to help pre-school children as young as three rid themselves of 'negative energy'.

New clientele: Relaxation classes are usually attended by stressed-out mothers but now pre-school children are invited to join one class in Manchester

Children are also encouraged to learn 'self soothe' techniques through massage and visualising fairytales during the hour-long classes.

Run by sisters Nicola Lamb and Cheryl Williams, the aim is to help children cope with the stress of school and busy schedules.

It is the first time the Relax Kids classes have been held in Manchester.

Former mental health worker and mother-of-one Nicola, 35, from Heaton Norris, Stockport, said: 'I had been looking for ways to prevent children getting mental health problems and this is a way of doing that without using medication.

'Kids today are so busy they don't get time out, rushing around in and out of school and rates of mental health illnesses amongst children are so much higher.

'A lot of teenagers also turn to drink or drugs nowadays, because they can't cope with emotions.

'These classes are about giving children life skills to go inside themselves and feel safe and strong.'

Cheryl, a mother-of-two and former residential care worker from Levenshulme, said: 'Having worked in children's homes I've seen so many young people with self esteem issues.

'Since I've trained in this technique I've really noticed the effect it has on my daughter's behaviour and now we hope to help others.'

The pair hope to expand into schools in Greater Manchester and also plan to run classes for parents and babies.

The classes will take place every week at Lev Inspire on Stockport Road, Levenshulme, costing Â£4 per child. Go to www.lev-inspire.org.uk for more details.
