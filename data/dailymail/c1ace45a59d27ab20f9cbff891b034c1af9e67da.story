Goga Ashkenazi is the Oxford 
University-educated socialite and entrepreneur who counts Prince Andrew 
as one of her nearest and dearest friends.

Dubbed a female Roman Abramovich, the impeccably-connected Kazakh, who 
was raised in Moscow and educated in the UK, has worked in a variety of 
industries, from oil to finance.

However, her latest venture is in fashion and in May 2012 she
bought the iconic French label Vionnet, whose fans include Madonna and Natalie Portman. And not only has she taken over the business side, but creative duties too.

Passion for fashion: Kazakh businesswoman and head of Vionnet fashion house Goga Ashkenazi looks overwhelmed at the end of her Vionnet Haute Couture SS14, to her left is Hussein Chalayan, who is also designing for the label

'I know who I am. I really love this and
 don't have to prove anything, because I'm doing it myself. Every day is
 a blast. I'm having fun,' she told Claudia Croft of the Sunday Times Style.

So committed to the cause is Goga that 
she even has a zipper tattooed along her neck, so
even when she's naked, she's 'wearing a Vionnet dress'.

It was in 2012 that Goga, 34, took a majority stake in the label, originally founded by the revolutionary fashion designer Madame Madeleine Vionnet in 1912.

A few months later her holding company, GoTo Enterprises Sarl, gained full control of the brand.

Speaking at the time of acquisition, she said: ‘Fashion is my passion and I spent a 
long time trying to find the right label to buy. Vionnet fitted like a 
glove. It’s elegance with a twist.

‘I
want to be very hands-on. I have many ideas. In time I hope to be 
involved with the design front. We also want to open a flagship Vionnet 
store in Paris.’ 

She took an extremely involved role at the fashion house (taking over the design reigns after the team 'just didn't turn up for work') and has designed eight collections, which have received mixed reviews.

Total control: Goga has taken on an extremely hands-on role at the fashion house, using her expertise to look after the design and finance side

Proving that she has both beauty and brains, the stylish beauty worked at top financial institutions such as Merrill Lynch before turning her hand to fashion.

She first gained public notoriety as a 
close friend of Prince Andrew, whom she was introduced to in 2001 by
 Lord Hanson's son Robert.

She was his guest at Ascot in 2007, although she denies rumours 
that they were ever an item. 'Andrew is merely a friend. When we go out for dinner it's, like, "Oh, my God",' she told the magazine.

Welcome to the good life: She may have a 
personal staff of 15 and eat caviar for breakfast, but Goga (R) insists 
she is not materialistic

Goga is known for her 
luxurious lifestyle. With a personal staff of 15, including chefs, 
butlers, maids, nannies and bodyguards, the immensely rich Goga, who eats caviar for breakfast, insists she is not materialistic.

‘I could live on $1,000-a-month easily. I can do everything - I don’t want to, and I don’t need to, but I could. If one day something happens, then I will build myself back up again, because I know I am young and able,' she once said.

She
 has two children by her on-off partner, married oil billionaire Timur 
Kulibayev, who famously bought Prince Andrew’s former home, Sunninghill 
Park, for £15 million.

Her two boys were cared for by Russian nannies until they were two years old.

Speaking about parenthood, she said: ‘When they are small they are not really aware you are there,

‘I’ve proven that because Adam doesn’t remember his first nannies at all.

‘So clearly working mothers don’t need to feel guilty for at least the first two years.’

However,
 in a recent interview with The Financial Times, she said: 'I hope they 
don't have to go to therapy for the things I did to them. But, you know,
 if they do, that's their journey. I can't change myself.'
