They are a popular addition to many seafood dishes.

But the world's scallops and oysters are mysteriously dying out, new figures have revealed. 

The creatures, which have been successfully farmed in pristine, deep water sounds off Vancouver Island in British Columbia since the 1970s, are now being killed off in dramatic numbers.

This is causing suppliers in area - once responsible for nearly two-fifths of Canada’s farmed shellfish - to warn of shortages and producers to worry about the future of their businesses.

Decline: British Columbia was once responsible for nearly two-fifths of Canada’s farmed shellfish. But as the area's scallops and oysters are mysteriously dying out, it now supplies only 20 per cent of the country's total

Alarmingly, scientists do not know what the culprit is behind the mass die-offs. However, the increasing acidification of the ocean has been widely cited as the main suspect. 

In the past two years, eight to nine-tenths of baby oysters have died in Desolation Sound farms - a shocking rise from the normal mortality rate of around 50 per cent, The Globe and Mail reported.

'It’s a remote area, the water is clean... we haven’t had any environmental concerns, so I’m not sure what’s going on,' Yves Perreault, who annually harvests half a million oysters at the farms, said. 

'To be frank, we don’t know a lot about it and that’s what’s scary.'

Meanwhile, scallop farmers off Vancouver Island have reported hatchling die-offs since 2010. 

Earlier this year, one-third of the workforce (20 employees) at Island Scallops were laid off because the business  lost more than 10 million scallops before they reached maturity.

When asked if he had ever seen such a mass die-off before, Rob Saunders, CEO of Island Scallops, told CDC: 'Nothing like this - continual mass mortality.'

Some people have pointed to warming coastal waters as a potential reason for the shocking figures. This shift in temperature is altering the timing of zooplankton blooms, which the shellfish feed off.

Others believe changes in the environment have worsened the devastation caused by an oyster herpes virus, which has been wiping out oysters in France and Australia, Quartz reported.

The virus has killed 26 percent of France’s oyster production since  2008, while it was reportedly responsible for the deaths of a staggering 10 million oysters in three days in Australia. 

And some, including Mr Perreault, have suggested that there may be too many scallops and oysters in the waters off Vancouver Island, and not enough food to feed them, putting them under stress.

Affected: When asked if he had ever seen such a mass die-off of scallops before, Rob Saunders (pictured), CEO of Island Scallops, told CDC : 'Nothing like this.' He added that he is convinced the ocean is more acidic

However, the main culprit in the mass die-offs of scallops and oysters is believed to be the ocean's acidification, with the pH levels at Vancouver Island having fallen drastically in recent years.

The levels slipped from an average of 8.1 in 1974 to 7.2 by 2001 (a pH of below 7 - on a scale of 0-14 - is considered acidic), according to The Vancouver Aquarium.

This is increasingly depriving baby shellfish of the carbonate ions they need to grow tough shells, which could leave them more vulnerable to parasites and disease, experts claim.

Mr Saunders said: 'I’m convinced the ocean is getting much more acidic, and much more acidic than anyone anywhere believed it could happen that fast.'

According to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the falling pH levels in the ocean are directly linked to the rising levels of CO2 in the atmosphere.

As carbon dioxide levels increase, so do those in the ocean, altering the seawater’s chemistry.

Sophia Johannessen, a research scientist, said it is clear oceans are becoming more acidic - but that more research needs to be done into the oyster and scallop die-offs to confirm a link.

Helen Gurney-Smith, of Vancouver Island University, agreed that further research is urgently needed to keep the shellfish industry afloat - adding that it is a 'global', not national problem. 

Every year, Canada produces more than 12,000 tonnes of oysters, worth a staggering $18million.

British Columbia was formerly responsible for 40 per cent of the country's shellfish crop.

Now, it supplies just 20 per cent.
