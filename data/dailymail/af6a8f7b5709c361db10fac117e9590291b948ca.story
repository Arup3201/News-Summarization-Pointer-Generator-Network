In the battle for supremacy between technology titans Apple and Samsung, the VP of sales for Samsung's mobile division saw the reaction to the death of Steve Jobs as the perfect time strike back at Apple.

In a document revealed this week as part of the current court battle between Apple and Samsung, Michael Pennington, head of national sales for Samsung offered his views as part of an ongoing email chain in 2011.

Samsung execs reportedly feared that Steve Jobs' death in 2011 could take attention away from the impending launch of its Galaxy S II.

Now is the time: When Steve Jobs passed away in 2011 Apple fans around the world mourned his loss, but Samsung, one of the company's biggest rivals tried to take advantage of the situation

Attack! Samsung executives wanted to come up with a campaign to attack Apple's iPhone 4S just as it was about to launch his holiday Samsung Galaxy II

Samsungs head of sales, Michael Pennington wrote in an email: 'Sorry to continue to push this issue, but I have seen this far too long and I know this is our best opportunity to attack iPhone'

'We need to take advantage of this chance,' wrote Dale Sohn, then the president and chief executive of Samsung Telecommunications America, according to AppleInsider.

Mr Pennington, who was irked by the coverage the iPhone 4S had received in the wake of Steve Jobs' death, replied stating how he wanted to generate some sort of reaction from Samsung.

In a message dated October 7th, two days after Jobs passed away:

'Unfortunately, Steve Job's [sic] passing has led to a huge wave of press coverage of Apple's and iPhone's 'superiority,' all created by the 'passionate, tireless, perfectionist...' The point here is that there is an unintended benefit for Apple, since the external messages by 3rd parties are all highlighting and/or supporting the consumer perception that Apple products are superior, since Jobs' [sic] was such a visionary and perfectionist. What consumer wouldn't feel great about purchasing a device developed by such a person.

'Sorry to continue to push this issue, but I have seen this far too long and I know this is our best opportunity to attack iPhone. If there is no consensus on the approach I initially proposed, I will stop pushing, but I would like to better understand our strategy so I can align with that,' he concluded.

Our way of thinking: In a recently released email, a Samsung executive believed the death of Apple co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs was the perfect time to attack the iPhone

What a thought: The email, from Samsung's Vice President of Sales Operations Michael Pennington, was revealed during the ongoing patent battle between Apple and Samsung

At one point, Mr Pennington considered asking Google if they might be able to launch a campaign against Apple:

'If it continues to be Samsung’s position to avoid attacking Apple due to their status as a large customer, can we go to Google and ask them to launch a campaign against Apple, based on the many better Android options available in the market for Q4 [2011],' he wrote.

Pennington however appeared not to be sure whether Ice Cream Sandwich (the latest version of the Android platform), which was to be released on October 19, could face iOS 5.

'Seems Google should be asked to carry their own weight in the battle,' he said. 'However, we could arrange a co-op arrangement for them if they use [our] device prominently in their marketing campaign. Is Ice Cream Sandwich strong enough to go head to head with iOS 5?'

The exec concluded his email saying that he believed the campaign was long overdue.

Todd Pendleton, Samsung Telecommunications America’s chief marketing officer, then replied that Samsung will execute the plan. 'Hey Michael, we are going to execute what you are recommending in our holiday [Galaxy S2] campaign, and go head to head with iPhone 4S,' he said.

'We are working on a very aggressive strategy touting our advantages in hardware and software. In the process we will demystify the perceived Apple advantage (ecosystem/services) by showing how consumers can easily switch to Android and have more personalization/more choice by being part of the Samsung ecosystem. More to come soon… Best TP,' Pendleton said.

Dirty tricks: Samsung called for an attack against the iPhone just a few days after Steve Jobs died

Ready for battle: Execs at Samsung knew that after Jobs died, there was going to be a lot of positive press for Apple and Jobs which would spill over to the iPhone. Samsung wanted to blunt the impact of all that positive press by pointing out why its phone was better than the iPhone

Samsung started attacking the iPhone that winter with their 'Next Big Thing' ad campaign in 2012, which mocked people for standing in line to buy Apple products. The ads were extremely effective.

While reviews praised the Galaxy S2, Samsung continued to escalate its anti-Apple marketing campaign in following years.

The most effective anti-iPhone campaigns followed in 2012, with Samsung launching its 'Next Big Thing' attack that became viral online.

An internal email exchange from Apple revealed earlier during the trial, showed that Apple was quite affected by this particular Samsung campaign, and even considered changing ad agencies to freshen up iPhone advertising.

Apple and Samsung have been waging their latest patent war in a trial that started March 31.

The two companies have accused each other of copying certain patented features for their own mobile devices.

Pennington is one of at least five high-ranking executives from Samsung's US mobile business who have left the company or given notice over the past two months.

Neither Apple nor Samsung immediately responded to a request for comment.
