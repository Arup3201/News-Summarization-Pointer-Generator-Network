The Australian health department is paying for its staff to undergo unproven methods to help them quit their smoking habits as part of its Smoke Free Workplace policy.

These include remedies such as hypnotherapy and acupuncture which have been offered to public servants who are trying to give up cigarettes, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

According to a health department spokeswoman, in the last financial year the government paid two workers a total of $1000 for hypnotherapy.

Since 2010, the department has examined applications for 'reasonable reimbursement of a range of activities to help employees quit smoking' a spokeswoman told the Herald.

The revelation comes after a question on notice was submitted by Labor senator Joe Ludwig. 

Hypnotherapy is one of the many methods used to help smokers quit their habits by placing suggestions in the subject's unconscious mind, according to Tobacco in Australia - a review compiled by the Cancer Council Victoria and funded by the department.

This weakens the desire to smoke, or strengthen their will to stop, or improve their ability to carry through a treatment program.

'The effectiveness of hypnosis has been poorly studied, with studies producing conflicting results,' the review states.

'It has not been shown that hypnotherapy itself increases long-term quitting rates, although counselling or other treatments that accompany it can be helpful to some smokers.

'To date, there is no clear evidence to support the use of hypnotherapy, acupuncture or related treatments in their own right as quitting aids.' 

However the funding for such therapies has been met with criticism from health experts.

Professor in public health at the University of Sydney, Simon Chapman, told the Sydney Morning Herald the department is 'just throwing money away and those procedures are often quite expensive'.

Mike Daube, a health policy professor at Curtin University in Perth, also told the Herald that the department should 'stick with what we know to be most effective'.

He suggests that staff should be urged to try giving up smoking cold turkey, go to their doctor for advice or opt for proven methods such as nicotine replacements.
