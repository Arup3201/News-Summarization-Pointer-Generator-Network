Justin Bieber proudly poses next to a career criminal charged more than 30 times in seven years for crimes involving drugs, robbery and violence - who
was introduced to him by his jailbird dad.

Renowned thug John Paul Atchison,39, has the picture posted on
his Facebook page, with the message, ‘you really are a pymp (sic) Justin Love
ya lots’ written beside it.

His Facebook profile is a shot of him and the superstar’s
dad Jeremy, who in turn has a Twitter photo of the two of them posing at the
$850,000 ranch Justin bought for him, taken in March.

Pals: John Paul Atchison poses proudly with Bieber. Canadian authorities only retain criminal records for seven
years, but Atchison still had 33 charges against his name in that period of
time. Alongside the picture he posted to Facebook in 2009, he said: 'You really are a pymp (sic) Justin Love
ya lots’

Influence: Those close to Justin fear that dad Jeremy Bieber, right, is trying to bring Atchison into Justin's inner circle. Here they are pictured together in March at the $850,000 ranch Bieber bought his father to live in

Sources close to the Bieber camp claim Jeremy is currently
trying to bring his close friend – from Justin’s hometown of Stratford - 
into the superstar’s inner circle.

It has even been suggested that Jeremy took Justin to the
local jail to see his criminal pal – known locally as JP - back in February.

When MailOnline visited Stratford Court house, the clerk
immediately knew Atchison by name and said she would not be able to provide
details of all of his convictions because it would take too long.

Canadian authorities only retain criminal records for seven
years, but Atchison still had 33 charges against his name in that period of
time.

They include possession of crystal meth, robbery, assault
with a weapon and a huge number of parole violations. 

The fact that Jeremy hangs out with Atchison and allows
him to spend time with his superstar son will add to the intense fear that he
is a terrible role model.

A source close to the Bieber camp told MailOnline: ‘Jeremy
has got a very dubious past and has spent time with a lot of very unpleasant
people, but Justin’s fame has given him the chance to move away from all of
that.

‘For some reason though, he is not prepared to turn his back
on these characters. In fact he seems to enjoy having them in his life.

'The fact he put a picture of him and JP up on Twitter for
all of his 2.2million followers to see proves that. 

‘That is his decision, but that doesn’t mean he should be
bringing them around Justin. His image has taken enough of a bashing in the
last year and he really does not need to be associating with people like JP.

‘He is a complete loser, with a serious drug problem and a
violent past. What kind of father would allow their child to spend time with a
person like that?

‘Even if Justin was just a regular kid, it would be stupid
to bring JP around your child, but considering Justin is in the public eye, it
makes it even more ridiculous.

‘And you have to question Jeremy’s decision to bring JP up
to his ranch. Not only is it owned by Justin, Jeremy’s two youngest children
live there too.

King of the world: Sources close to Bieber, pictured in New York on Tuesday, said: 'Atchison is a complete loser, with a serious drug problem and a violent past. What kind of father would allow their child to spend time with a person like that?'

Role model: Jeremy Bieber has been spending a lot of time with his son over the last year despite not being there for much of the time the star was growing up. He has been by his side during many of his

‘This guy has got several convictions for crystal meth
possession and violence. That says it all really and would make anyone question
Jeremy’s responsibility as a father.’

Justin and Jeremy’s relationship has come under intense
scrutiny in recent months, with many accusing the convicted criminal of being a
bad influence and a scrounger.

Jeremy has apparently never held down a regular job, but he
lives in an $850,000 ranch bought for him by his multi-millionaire son. He has
also allegedly boasted that he is given a $50,000 a month allowance by his son.

He has been present when the hit-maker has got into trouble.

In January, Justin was arrested in Miami Beach, Florida, on
suspicion of driving under the influence, driving with an expired license and
resisting arrest without violence. Jeremy had accompanied his son on the
controversial break.

The day after Justin was released from custody on a $2,500
bond, the father and son pair were pictured out partying.
