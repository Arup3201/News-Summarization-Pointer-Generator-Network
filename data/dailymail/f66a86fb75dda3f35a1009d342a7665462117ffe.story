Claire Duke, 38, leaves Cannock Magistrates Court after being charged with fraud

A woman has appeared in court charged with conning Premier League footballers out of thousands of pounds while working as their 'lifestyle coach'.

Claire Duke, from St. Albans, Hertfordshire, is accused of defrauding high-profile clients - including Cardiff City FC striker Peter Odemwingie - out of £71,000 over a one year period.

It is alleged the 38-year-old received money for holidays and flights from her clients but would keep the money for herself.

Today Duke appeared at Cannock Magistrates Court charged with five counts of fraud and one of theft.

Between September 1 last year and July 10 of this year she is accused of making a total of £71,106.83 fraudulently.

Among the charges was that while she was the lifestyle consultant of 32-year-old Odemwingie she dishonestly stole £15,437.67 using his debit card.

Dressed smartly in a grey dress and black blazer, Duke spoke only to confirm her name and age in court.

She gave no indication of her plea.

She was granted bail until a plea and case management hearing for February 7 next year at Stafford Crown Court.

After the hearing she drove away from court in a top of the range Audi A5 convertible.
