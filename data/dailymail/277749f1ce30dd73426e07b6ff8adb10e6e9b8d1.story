Hatem Ben Arfa has joined Hull City on loan for the remainder of the season, bringing an end to his exile at Newcastle United, on the night Gaston Ramirez signed for the club.

The French playmaker had been banished to the reserves by Magpies boss Alan Pardew, who had become disillusion with the player’s ‘lack of professionalism’.

But Hull boss Steve Bruce made an audacious move for Ben Arfa and the 27-year-old's move was announced by the club at just after midnight on Monday.

Unwanted: Gaston Ramirez joins Hull as well after failing to impress at Southampton

Given the loan arrangement, he will not be able to face his parent club, but with his contract up next summer he could make his move permanent at the end of the season.

Ramirez has signed on a season-long loan from Southampton. Tigers boss Bruce said: ‘Gaston significantly improves our attacking options and I’m delighted to welcome him to the club. He is yet another quality addition as we look to build on what we achieved last season.’ 

Earlier in the day he completed the £9.5million club-record signing of Abel Hernandez and brought in West Ham midfielder Mohamed Diame.
