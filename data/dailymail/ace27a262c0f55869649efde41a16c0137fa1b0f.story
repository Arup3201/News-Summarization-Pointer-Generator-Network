A restaurant customer who asked for cheese and biscuits to finish off her meal was handed a plate of brie, cheddar and red Leicester alongside custard creams, Jammie Dodgers and bourbons.

Diane Murray, an NHS assistant director in Ayrshire, was handed the unusual selection of biscuits to accompany the cheese at an as-yet-unnamed hotel restaurant.

Ms Murray and her step-daughter Steph Kerr took to Twitter to share news of the bizarre encounter, with the latter writing on the social media site: ‘If you need cheering up, here's a photo of the time my stepmum asked for cheese and biscuits at a hotel.’

Ms Murray also took to Twitter to share news of the unusual cheeseboard, writing: ‘Cheese and biscuits. If anyone pledges to Comic Relief I'll tell them which hotel they can get this in.’

She accompanied the post with a photograph of the 'cheeseboard', which revealed a few lumps of cheese in a white bowel surrounded by the popular sweet biscuits. 

The tweet, which was accompanied by laughing emojis, has gone viral after being shared more than 9,000 times and has received plenty of response online.

Ms Murray has so far remained tight-lipped about the name of the restaurant but it is hoped she will reveal the premises following donations to Comic Relief. 

MailOnline has tried to contact Ms Murray and Ms Kerr for further comment.
