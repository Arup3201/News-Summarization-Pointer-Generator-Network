Islamic State militants are turning Christian churches into torture chambers where they force attendees to convert to Islam, it has been reported.

The fanatics are also said to be stripping the former places of worship of ancient relics, which they are smuggling to Western collectors to help fund their terrorist activity.

Christians were reportedly being held captive in make-shift torture chambers set up in raided churches in Qaraqosh, Iraq.

An expert told the Jerusalem Post that the terror organisation's goal was to 'wipe out Christianity.' 

'This is why they are crucifying Christians — which includes children — destroying churches and selling artifacts,' he told the newspaper.

'The reality is, this group will stop at practically nothing to raise funds for its terrorist mission.'

 Jihadists have pocketed around £23million from the sale of stolen artefacts in Nabaq, Syria, according to the Christian Post.

It was not known what relics had been stolen during the raid on churches. 

The news comes as it has been revealed that militants captured a Jordanian pilot after his warplane crashed while conducting airstrikes over Syria
