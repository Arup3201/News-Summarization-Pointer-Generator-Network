The woman charged with the murders of seven of her children and one young niece in her Cairns home 'knows what has happened' but it 'hasn't sunk in yet,' her lawyer said today.

Raina Thaiday, 37, who is also known as Mersane Warria, is being held in Cairns Base Hospital on under police guard, and did not appear in court when the charged against her were mentioned today.

'She's presently on an involuntary treatment order, which means she will be assessed so once she has been assessed then it may go to the mental health court at that stage,' her lawyer, Steve Macfarlane, said outside Cairns courthouse.

New details have been revealed about mother-of-nine Raina Mersane Ina Thaiday, who was formally charged with the stabbing deaths of eight children in her Cairns home on Friday morning

'She's coping as best as she can in Cairns Base Hospital where she will be for a while.'

Asked by journalists about her state, Mr Macfarlane said: 'I'm not a doctor, but I think she probably knows what happened but doesn't realise it, it hasn't sunk in.'

Magistrate Alan Comans adjourned the case until January 30.

'Until she's finished her treatment and police have finished their investigation there's not a lot that can be done,' Mr Macfarlane said.

Thaiday's lawyer also confirmed the alleged murderer has had visitors to her bedside.

'I'm aware that she has been visited by some people but how close a family member they are and how many people I am not aware of,' Mr Macfarlane said.

Inside court, no family attended the hearing as Mr Macfarlane requested the trial be heard in a mental health court.

Mr Comans rejected the request, saying: 'No, there is no need.'

Local member of parliament Gavin King said the house where the children's bodies were found would likely be demolished and a permanent memorial erected, as it was what the community wanted.

'It is the right thing to do to help with the healing process,' Mr King told reporters near the property. 

As police try and determine what could have driven Thaiday to allegedly murder seven of her nine children, along with a niece, at a home in Manoora, a suburb of Cairns, north Queensland, new details have emerged regarding her troubled past and recent erratic behaviour.

Neighbours have told how she reportedly ran through the streets on Thursday night screaming ‘Don’t let them take them away from us. God bless us. Forgive me for what I’ll do’.

A local told The Courier Mail that after recently finding God, Thaiday believed mobile phones were 'the work of the devil'.

The Australian reported Thaiday's, whose nine children had five different fathers, struggled to find a stable home after falling pregnant at 14 and was allegedly attacked with a hammer a decade ago.

While she is refusing to speak to police in any detail about the horrific stabbings she has been calling the tragic deaths ‘the incident’, The Australian says. 

Thaiday, 37, has been formally charged with the deaths of four girls, aged 14, 12, 11, and two, and four boys, aged 9, 8, 6, and five, who were found in their Murray Street home by their 20-year-old brother on Friday morning.

An uncle of the eight children said Thaiday had begun expressing increased religious devotion, attending St Margaret’s Anglican Church in Westcourt every Sunday for the month leading up to the alleged mass murder.

'She had this church DVD she was always watching. She'd started preaching to me in the last week or so. Always talking about God,’ he said.

More neighbours revealed Thaiday was seen by neighbours running through the street screaming at 3am on the morning the bodies were found.

Senior investigators refused to rule out the possibility that drugs were a factor in Thaiday’s behaviour.

The grandmother of seven of the children who were killed wailed: 'No! No! My babies, my babies!'

Shortly after she gave birth to her first child she moved into cramped public housing in Manoora and was shunted between houses as her family grew, The Australian reported.

Anna Jackson, who has known Thaiday for more than 20 years, said she had been abused by a former partner, who allegedly bashed her on the head with a hammer.

Less than a week ago, one of the children's fathers moved out of the home  they shared after the children’s uncle reported hearing fighting.

'He's been heard shouting at her that if she didn't stop, he was leaving. And then he did, moving into a house with other relatives,' he said.

'The dad wanted to take the kids up to Bamaga. That's what he told me he was doing, he'd been talking about it for six weeks.’

Thaiday appeared before a magistrate in a bedside hearing at the Cairns hospital, where she is being treated for stab wounds to the chest, which were possibly self-inflicted. 

At the house were heartbreaking scenes as family members made their way up to a willow tree where tributes have been left for the young alleged victims.

The maternal grandmother of seven of the children who were killed wailed: 'No! No! My babies, my babies!'

She was supported by other family members as she wailed, her eyes closed in raw grief as she clutched a small white towel to her face to wipe away her tears.

Several men carried one of the fathers to the scene where he sat on a seat - weak and inconsolable.

He was frail and unable to hold his own body up as he screamed his children's names into the sky in a hoarse voice. 

The father of the youngest four children was carried to add flowers to the tribute, collapsing on the floor and beating the ground at the foot of the tree.

‘Raiden’, ‘Rodney’, ‘Azza’ and ‘baby girl’, the father screamed over and over again in a rasping voice, while sobbing uncontrollably.

Detective Inspector Bruno Ansicar told reporters on Sunday the horrific scene was taking its toll on police.

'It's clearly the most tragic event we've had to deal with (in Cairns),' Insp Ansicar told reporters.

Vigils and memorials for the slain children, who ranged in age from two to 14, were held throughout Queensland on Sunday. 

Townsville and the Brisbane suburb of Inala also hosted memorials.
