Over the last year, Samantha Brick has found time to become a successful - if controversial - columnist, appear on Celebrity Big Brother - and now write a book.

But the 'don't hate me because I'm beautiful' writer says that work is now at the bottom of her priorities list, with husband Pascal firmly placed in the top spot.

'Probably the single biggest thing I've 
learned about myself since moving to France is that the rat race isn't 
the be all and end all,' she says.

Happy: Samantha says life is better than ever since she moved to France and learned that work isn't everything

'Before I would just work, work, work... BlackBerry
under the pillow, laptop by the side of the bed. Now I've changed my priorities 
completely.

'I'm a wife first, a stepmother second and a writer third, 
and I say it in that order deliberately because those are the 
priorities in my life now.'

Speaking in a video released by publishers, Summersdale, Samantha was also happy to open up about her future plans, which, she says, include becoming a farmer.

'There's never a dull moment in my part of France and the future is really exciting,' she revealed.

'We're planning to have a baby; we're 
starting a family. We're also planning to buy a farm and I'm going to 
become a French female farmer in the not too distant future.'

But before realising her agricultural dreams, Samantha has her new book, Head Over Heels In France, to finish promoting.

Love: Head Over Heels In France is for people who want a love story or who are curious about French life

First: Samantha says that husband Pascal is now her top priority while work has been pushed down the list

The book, which tells the story of her first year on the opposite side of the Channel reveals how she fell in love with carpenter husband Pascal and how she coped with transitioning from high flying TV executive to French housewife.

'The reason I wrote Head over Heels in France is because at the age of 36 in 2007, the biggest thing that ever happened to me in my life occurred in that I fell in love with a Frenchman,' she explains.

'A camouflage-wearing, gitane-smoking muscly macho macho carpenter - in other words, the complete opposite of me.

'I fell head over heels in love and so I moved to France where I didn't even speak the language, and I just made this life-changing decision on a whim and for 12 months of my life, every day I woke up to something new and to something different and it was extraordinary.

'Head Over Heels In France is going to be read, I hope, by anyone who is attracted to a love story. It's also for those people who are fascinated by and curious about what life in France is really like.

If I can do it then anyone can do it and that's the message I really hope people take away from the book.'
