Chievo Verona appointed former player Rolando Maran as coach on Sunday after sacking Eugenio Corini following a poor start to the Serie A season.

Chievo announced the decision a day after the team was comfortably beaten 3-0 at Roma, their fifth loss in seven matches.

'It is very emotional for me,' Maran said. 'It's a double joy because I spent almost my entire playing career at Chievo Verona. Now that I'm returning as coach I hope to relive the emotions I had in those years.'

Maran started playing for Chievo in 1986 when the team was in Italy's fourth division and went on to make 330 appearances for the club, many as captain, helping it up to the second tier.

He was also assistant manager to Silvio Baldini in 1997-98, when Chievo was in Serie B.

Chievo had announced Corini's dismissal earlier in the day but had to wait until Maran resolved his contract with Catania, which sacked him last season.

Corini, who was in his second spell in charge of Chievo, was the first Serie A coach to be sacked this season.

Roma captain Francesco Totti and his team-mate piled the pressure on Eugenio Corini, and he was soon gone
