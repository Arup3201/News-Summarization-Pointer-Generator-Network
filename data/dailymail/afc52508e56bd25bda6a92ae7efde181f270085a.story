From the elegant stalk of an apple to fine fabric of a tea bag, the remarkable beauty of everyday objects is often hidden to the naked eye.

But zoom in closer, and an alien world appears as mundane items found around the house rapidly transform into works of art.

In a series titled ‘Amazing Worlds within our Worlds’, artist Pyanek has captured the delicate details in objects such as a kitchen sponge, keys, spaghetti, incense sticks and a serrated knife. 

The photographer used a Canon T3i (600D/Kiss X5) with the kit lens reversed, a HeliconFocus for focus stacking and Lightroom and Exposure 5 for editing. 

‘I don't have a rack or any special lights, I did the stacking by literally moving the lens with my hand, taking a photo, moving it again, taking another, then joining them with the software,' he writes. 

Pyanek, who has chosen not to reveal his identity or location, explains on his YouTube channel that he works on the philosophy that art should be free and has made his images available for use by the public.

Red lipstick such as this may be made from waxes such as beeswax, as well as ingredients such as olive oil, mineral oil and cocoa butter

The patterned flecks on a matchstick (pictured) are contrasted against the smooth texture of lipstick and rough surface of a brass key

This alien looking structure is in fact a kitchen sponge. 'The shot is of the curved edge on the sponge, so there is detail in the forefront and goes out of focus way way back, which gives it more depth,' the photographer wrote on his Youtube channel

On the left is a close up of spaghetti, while the right image shows the bubbles in soap foam. 'I did the stacking by literally moving the lens with my hand,' the photographer writes
