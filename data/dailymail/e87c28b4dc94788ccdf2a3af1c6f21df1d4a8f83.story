Their embrace lasted no more than a few seconds. But a tearful boy of 11 innocently encapsulated the buoyant mood of the nation yesterday after witnessing Andy Murray become an Olympic champion.

Henry Caplan raced down through the stands at Wimbledon’s Centre Court to hug the tennis star after what turned out to be one of the best days of each of their separate lives.

But in that magic moment – captured on giant screens around the court and broadcast to the world – Britain’s feelgood barometer soared after a weekend during which the country, quite simply, went Olympics daft.

...and this one's for the gold medal

For Murray, it was the moment he 
turned a dream to reality and sensationally added an Olympic gold to 
Britain’s astonishing medal tally.

For
young Master Caplan, it was the opportunity of a lifetime to share in 
the glory of one of his top sporting heroes during a peak of national 
excitement over the Games.

One
minute, he was sitting with his father in the dizzy heights of row Z. 
The next, he broke free to sprint down towards Murray and into the 
players’ box. ‘Give me a hug!’ he cheekily demanded. ‘Anything for my 
fan,’ said Murray, and readily obliged.

Yesterday
as he waited for another glimpse of Murray and his other tennis hero, 
Roger Federer, he told me: ‘I was just so happy. I had to let him know. 
I’m his biggest fan and I didn’t want to miss my chance.’

His father Elliot, a 
41-year-old furniture supplier from Blackmore, Essex, said: ‘I was 
hugging him at the end of the match because he was overwhelmed and 
crying with joy.

He said “get off me” and slipped out of my arms. ‘Next thing I know, he’s all over the telly screens giving Andy Murray a hug.’

Jumping for joy, punching the air in triumph, Murray ran back on to the grass to celebrate his prize.

Meanwhile he had made a fan for life. Henry, from Blackmore, Essex, told BBC Essex: 'As soon as Andy Murray won I was crying with joy and hugging my dad.

'I told my dad to get off and the next minute I was gone. I was down by the royal bit in front of Federer’s mum and dad.

'Then I hugged Andy Murray. I just thought I had to be there. It was cool.'

Four
weeks on from the moment he left Centre Court in tears, the 25-year-old
champion-in-waiting had returned to take his revenge on arch rival 
Federer – and to stride spectacularly into the record books.

He declared his victory ‘the biggest win of my life’ and added: ‘I’ll never forget this moment.’

Murray won Britain its first gold medal in the men’s singles for more than a century, since the 1908 London Games.

Then he topped it up with silver 
alongside national sweetheart Laura Robson in the mixed doubles.

So it 
wasn’t hard to understand why the famously grumpy Scot managed to raise 
an ecstatic smile yesterday as he took a well-deserved share in this 
most glorious weekend in British sport.

He
even had a stab at mouthing the national anthem – and willingly draped 
himself in a Union Flag after being presented with his first Olympic 
gong.

His victory was the 
latest in a succession of triumphs to lift the country’s spirits in a 
way that few anticipated before the start of the Games.

For
just under two hours yesterday Murray was swept along on a wave of 
British support that started with a rousing welcome to Centre Court, 
possibly twice the decibel level of that raised for his Swiss adversary.

If volume alone could have
won it for him, he would surely have finished in half that time. The 
cheering was more like Wembley than Wimbledon, and there was no doubt it
helped to lift his game.

‘Come
on England!’ someone shouted, causing a ripple of laughter that tickled
even the Swiss. Another called out sarcastically: ‘We feel quite 
strongly about you Andy.’ 

Despite
the ribaldry, however, few could have doubted they were cheering a 
future Wimbledon champion.

Yesterday Murray went in as the underdog and 
emerged as the victor, and there’s nothing a British crowd likes better 
than that.

Afterwards he immediately paid tribute to the fans, declaring: ‘The support has been amazing. The crowd are unbelievable.’

From the start of the match it was clear that Murray was on a high.

You
didn’t have to know anything about tennis to work that out.

Watching 
his fist keeping a log of his successes and mistakes was enough.

He
held it at chest level and shook it like Spanish maracas when he missed
a shot; chin level, like a karaoke microphone, when he was pleased with
himself; and high in the air when he triumphed.

Even
if you weren’t well placed to monitor that, there was always the 
Judyometer. At the opposite end of the players’ box from his girlfriend 
Kim Sears, his mother sat motionless during his botched shots, but 
sprang to her feet to applaud his most spectacular moves.

Ditto
Laura Robson, who spent much of the match sitting behind Mrs Murray, 
showing not a trace of nervousness in the run up to the big moment that 
would follow.

Likewise, 
Murray seemed unusually confident. Sometimes even relaxed. Just over 35 
minutes into the match, a return bounced tantalisingly on top of the net
before tumbling over to his advantage. Four weeks ago the fist might 
have been punching the air to celebrate a vital extra point. Yesterday 
he simply chuckled.

Thirty 
minutes later, Team Roger unfurled a Swiss flag and draped it over the 
front of the players’ box. If it was meant to be a talisman it didn’t 
quite do the trick. With Murray in this form, Federer needed much more 
than luck on his side.

Out 
of sight of Centre Court, Murray Mount – formerly Henman Hill, formally 
Aorangi Terrace – was heaving with spectators. Some sat gently steaming 
in the sun that followed a huge downpour.

How disappointed they must 
have been to see pictures on the big screen showing small swathes of 
empty seats.

By the time 
the scoreboard began to signal that Murray was looking unstoppable, Andy
pandemonium broke out in the stands.

It could never match the cheers of
80,000 in that other stadium behind the clearly defined London skyline 
in the distance, but it was like nothing most people have heard at the 
All England club before.

Then
came Henry. Mr Caplan paid just £260 for tickets for himself, Henry and
sons Alex, nine, and Jeremy, 19. ‘I think you could safely say it was 
worth it,’ he said.

Speaking
later about the hug, Murray told me: ‘I actually thought, because he 
was in Roger Federer’s box and he asked me for a hug... I didn’t know 
quite how to react. I thought maybe he was from Roger’s team.’

Was
he pleased to have made a big fan out of a small boy? ‘That’s one of 
the reasons why the Olympics is so great,’ he said. ‘Everyone gets into 
them.’

Murray became the 
first British man to win the gold in singles since Josiah Ritchie in 
1908.

As well as gold, Ritchie won silver in the men’s doubles and 
bronze in the men’s indoor singles.

His record stood untouched until 
shortly after 4pm yesterday.

But
as Murray waits over the next 11 months for another crack at the 
Wimbledon title, he would do well not to be over confident. Ritchie lost
the singles final in 1909.

But Murray has turned his sights towards winning his first Grand Slam tennis tournament at the US Open in three weeks’ time.

The 25-year-old Scot said he hopes to be rested enough for success after coming so close at Wimbledon last month.

'I’ve felt close to Grand Slams before, and obviously this is the biggest title of my career,' he said. 'I’ve got the US Open in three weeks’ time, so I’ll have to get myself rested.

'I’m leaving for Toronto later today, there’s a tournament starts there. I play my first match on Wednesday.

'I’ve got three weeks to get myself ready for the US Open, and I hope that can be the first one.'
