Four alleged terrorists targeted Danish Crown Prince Frederik as part of their planned revenge attack on a newspaper that printed cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, a court heard today.

The suspects intended to attack the offices of Politiken in a Mumbai-style terror attack when the crown prince was handing out awards, it was claimed.

The men were arrested on their way to the ceremony which eventually took place at the paper as planned.

The four men - three Danish citizens and one resident of Sweden - are accused of terrorism and illegal possession of weaponry.

Prosecutor Henrik Plaehn said 
the alleged terrorists were linked with Pakistan, a point he would try 
to prove during the trial.

Surrounded by heavily armed police, the 
four defendants were led in handcuffs into the media-packed courtroom 
just outside Copenhagen, the Danish capital, where they were accused of 
terrorism and illegal possession of weapons.

A lawyer for one of the accused, Mounir Ben Mohamed Dhahri, said today before the trial that his client would plead guilty to having weapons but would deny the terrorism charge.

Three of the four accused were arrested in December 2010 while they were allegedly on their way to carry out Mumbai-style shooting at the Jyllands-Posten newspaper that published 12 cartoons of the prophet in 2005.

The fourth defendant, Sabhi Ben Mohamed Zalouti, left the car while it was en route and returned to Stockholm, where he was arrested the same day as the others.

Surrounded by heavily armed police, the four men were led in handcuffs into the media-packed courtroom just outside the capital of Copenhagen.

The men - Dahri, Zalouti, Munir Awad and Omar Abdalla Aboelazm - could face 16 years in prison if found guilty, while prosecutors are expected to ask that the men be deported from Denmark after serving their sentence.

Awad, Aboelazm and Zalouti are likely to plead not guilty to both the terrorism and weapons accusations.

Swedish security police had been 
monitoring the group for months. After the arrest, Danish security 
officials described the men as 'militant Islamists with relations to 
international terror networks.'

News of the group's alleged attack plans sent a tremor through the largely peaceful Danish society, which is attempting to lay to rest the 2005 cartoon debacle.

The trial will last approximately two months, with a verdict expected in mid-June.

Early in 2011, a Danish court 
declared a Somali man guilty of terrorism for breaking into the home of a
Danish cartoonist who had caricatured the Prophet.

Wielding an ax, the man entered Kurt 
Westergaard's home in the northwestern town of Aarhus, though the 
cartoonist avoided injury by locking himself inside a panic room. The 
Somali man was eventually sentenced to nine years in prison.
