A leading doctor has reassured Real Madrid fans that Cristiano Ronaldo's patella tendon is unlikely to cause him problems in the long-term.

Dr Pedro Luis Ripoll, of the FIFA-accredited Ripoll Y De Prado sports clinic, told Marca that there is only a 10 per cent likelihood Ronaldo will require surgery on his troublesome knee.

The Portugal star has been plagued by continuous niggles in his knee since last season, contributing to a below-average showing at the World Cup, but Dr Ripoll suggested Ronaldo has very little to worry about.

'There's no reason for concern. Only 10 per cent of these injuries require surgery,' he said.

Real fans are worried their talisman, who has scored 18 goals in 12 appearances for club and country so far this season, will be sidelined by tendinitis at some point, affecting their chances of winning La Liga and retaining the Champions League.

They suffered a further scare at the weekend when Ronaldo strapped an ice pack to his left knee on the bench after being substituted in Portugal's 1-0 friendly defeat to France in Paris.

But this was later revealed to be just a precaution, part of a treatment plan Ronaldo and medical staff have devised to keep him fit and firing.

Ripoll's comments suggest the 29-year-old will be playing at the highest level for many years to come.

Ronaldo is already Portugal's record goalscorer and he extended his total to 51 on Tuesday night with a towering, last-minute header to defeat Denmark in a Euro 2016 qualifier.
