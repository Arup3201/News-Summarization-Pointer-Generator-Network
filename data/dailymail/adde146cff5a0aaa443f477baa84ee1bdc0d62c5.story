A human head and a decapitated torso discovered 45 kilometres apart in regional Queensland do not belong to the same person, police have revealed.

Tests have determined the adult head and the previously discovered torso found near Gympie are from different bodies.

Toolara Forestry workers, who were clearing at the time, found the head in a tree plantation about 1km off Cooloola Coast Rd on April 11.

The torso was discovered on Cedar Pocket Rd on September 19, 2013.

Unsolved mystery: A torso, found on Cedar Pocket Rd, pictured, in September 2013, does not match a head found just 45km away in April

On Wednesday, Detective Inspector Bruce McNab said tests proved the head and torso do not match, the Courier Mail reported.

The grim discovery of the torso left Gympie, with a population of about 18,000, horrified when it was found burning on the side of the road. 

The torso was decapitated above the collarbone and below the rib cage and had its hands gruesomely hacked off at the wrist.

Tests indicated the torso belonged to an athletic man, who was taking medication for high blood pressure, malaria, cramps and restless leg syndrome.

He is believed to have been aged between 40 and 80, of a solid build and between 180cm and 190cm.

There were no tattoos on his upper chest and there was no match on the DNA database, which means he had no criminal history.

The torso revealed a 3cm scar on the right side of the man's back, about halfway down, from an old injury.

Since the find, there have been no reports of a missing person despite public appeals for information. Cadaver dogs have also been used as part of police investigations.

Clues: A burnt towel was found near the the burning torso

With the mystery baffling Queensland police, the FBI and international forensic experts are being used to help solve the case.

Last month, Insp McNab said items of interest had been discovered in the search of Toolara State Forest, but could not reveal what they were.

'We have found some other items of interest during the search we have done of the area and we are still searching there,' he said. 'We are not able to say what those items are.'

The charred towel found near the torso was wrapped in tarp-like material. A plain-coloured T-shirt was also found.

Police are looking for a female suspect, described as small to medium build, middle aged, with blonde to brown shoulder-length hair.

Call for help: Queensland police are asking for public assistance with the ongoing investigations

It is believed she was wearing black exercise pants to her knee and driving an orange to brown hatchback.

Sighted in the Gympie area for about an hour on the night of September 19, the woman was seen at her car on the side of Cedar Creek Rd, outside the town's centre.

Police have been able to piece together details about her movements, with passing drivers seeing her in the driver’s seat of the car and also standing next to the front passenger door.

The woman was also seen leaning over a grass area near the road's edge but kept her head down, with her back to the road.

At 6.30pm, shortly after she left the area, passing motorists saw a fire at the same grass area.

The fire revealed a burning torso, which had been doused in an ­accelerant and set alight.

Insp McNab said investigations into the gruesome discoveries human body parts remains were ongoing.

'We continue to appeal to anyone who has any information on either of these incidents to come forward,' he said.

Anyone with information should contact Crime Stoppers anonymously via 1800 333 000 or crimestoppers.com.au
