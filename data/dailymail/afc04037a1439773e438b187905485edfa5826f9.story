This is the moment a passenger plane travelling to San Francisco was forced to dump its fuel load over the Irish Sea and return to Heathrow following a loss of cabin pressure.

United Airlines flight UA900 was forced to turn around today shortly after  passing south of Morecambe Bay - about an hour after taking off from Heathrow.

The plane, which had  374 passengers onboard with a crew of 19,  dumped its fuel load before landing back at the west London airport at 12.52 pm.

Passenger Christopher Bourke, who took this picture of the plane, said he noticed something was not right during take off.

'You could feel your ears pop when we took off which was extremely unusual, that normally happens when landing. You could feel something was not quite right.

'After a while the cabin crew remained seated and were chatting on private phones to the flight deck.

'I could here someone saying that there was a bit of a problem. Shortly after that the co-pilot said that we had to turn around because there was a problem with the pressure.'

Mr Bourke said passengers remained calm but some were annoyed and frustrated.

'There were some moans and groans from people. Lots of people were starting their summer holidays and were a bit frustrated.'

Today's incident comes after a United Airlines plane en route from Heathrow to Washington DC 
with 150 passengers on board had to make an emergency landing at Dublin 
last week because of a 'technical issue'.

United
said the plane in today’s incident was a Boeing 747-400 and it landed safely at Heathrow at 12.52 pm.

The airline said the flight was then cancelled 'because necessary maintenance work could not be completed before the crew exceeded their legally-permitted duty hours'.

Passengers are staying in hotels this evening before departing on United Flight UA1753 which is due to leave Heathrow at 11.30am tomorrow.

A spokesman said: 'We apologise to our customers for the inconvenience caused.'
