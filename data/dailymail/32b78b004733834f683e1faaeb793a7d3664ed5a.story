A Spanish town is using a novel way to tackle the problem of dog mess on its streets - by installing a public toilet for pets.

The metal contraption was donated to El Vendrell by its creator Enric Girona to make it quick and painless to clean up after a dog.

But people in the north-eastern province of Tarragona, Catalonia, say it simply doesn't work.

The dog toilet was donated to El Vendrell, in north-east Spain, by its creator Enric Girona to make it quick and painless to clean up after a pet

One of the dog owners said: 'It's useless. What has been spent on this area could build a fence to let the animals loose inside.

'Animals are not toys. They defecate, urinate and return home. They also need to socialise.'

Another said: 'The main problem for us, for the dogs, is the material, it's steel. I think it would be better with grass.'

But not all the pet owners in the are against it.

One said: 'I am in favour of it, if the mayor does not use this device to charge more taxes, then that's fine.

'But if we have to charge more to pensioners who are fed up with bills and fees, that does not seem right.'

The toilet is supposed to work much like a human convenience.

Dog mess is deposited into a stainless-steel basin through a hole in the lid, and is flushed away by jets of water when the handle is pumped.

There is also a water fountain, as well as a dedicated urinal grille to allow animals to scent mark without fouling the surrounding area.

Pet owners who don't clean up after their furry friends in El Vendrell can face fines of up to €750 ($1,020).
