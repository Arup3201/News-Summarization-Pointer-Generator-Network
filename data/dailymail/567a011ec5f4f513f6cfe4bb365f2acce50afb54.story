Andrei Arshavin's dramatic 2009 move from Zenit St Petersburg to Arsenal was clinched, agent Jon Smith says, when he put up £1.2million demanded by the Russian club out of his own pocket. 

Smith relived perhaps the tightest deal in transfer history, that was finally secured with a one-word email eight seconds from the deadline, while a guest on BT Sport on Monday.

As one of the duller  transfer deadline days in recent times played out, Smith reached into his extensive vault of football business experience to offer some insight into what was really going behind the scenes  amid the speculation about player moves.

Andrei Arshavin's £15million move from Zenit to Arsenal was completed with eight seconds to spare

'I was involved with Andrei Arshavin. That deal started in the second week in January,' he recalled. 

'Funnily enough, the guy at the Russian end was in charge of the Russia national gas company at the time. The previous week he'd cut off the Czech Republic's supply and this week he was talking about football deals.'

Smith says discussion were stunted from that point until the deadline was imminent on January 30.

'We got to the 30th of January, and everyone thought we better hurry up here. Then it got really serious,' he said on BT Sport.

'It was snowing. So we flew the player over anyway (Ashavin was in Paris and Smith, with his brother Phil, feared he'd be stranded there). 

'It got to the very last day and we were about £1.2million apart with about an hour to go. And it was literally who blinked, and I sat in the middle of it as the agent.

'In the end, I offered the Russians the extra money. And I said to Arsenal I've done this. And we had 30 seconds to go.'

The drama didn't end there, with the Russians unable to fax their approval of the deal through to Arsenal.  

Although Arshavin scored four against Liverpool early in his career, his time at the Emirates didn't last

'They had to email it through, and with eight seconds to go the Russians came through with the word 'accepted'.'

And the £15million deal was done. 

What came after wasn't quite as exciting, with Arshavin starting well with an early four-goal bag against Liverpool but he failed to light up the Emirates consistently. He was eventually sold back to Zenit in June 2013 having been sent back there on loan with 31 goals in his 143 games for the Gunners.
