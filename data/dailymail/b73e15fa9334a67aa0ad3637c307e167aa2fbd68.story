Bantham in South Devon was placed on the market by its private owners sparking interest from across the world

And now in a bid to stop it being snapped up by foreign investors the National Trust has launched an appeal to raise £7.2million to buy land around the seaside village

The trust 
wants to buy Bantham beach and the Avon estuary, to maintain quality 
access to the sandy beach for the hundreds of thousands of people who 
visit each year and to protect the landscape along the unspoilt coastal 
site for nature.

The
 beach, nestling in the South Hams, has panoramic views over Bigbury Bay
 and Burgh Island is the famous setting for Agatha Christie novels and 
TV adaptations.

If successful, it would be the National Trust's most expensive coastal purchase.

But a failure to secure the beach - described as the best surfing beach in south Devon - and the estuary for the nation could leave its future uncertain, it warned.

The National Trust has already been able to commit £4.6 million from its Neptune campaign to protect coastal areas, but urgently needs to raise another £2.6 million to buy the beach and estuary and pay initial management and conservation costs

The trust 
fears access to the beach could be reduced and the coastline could be at
 risk of inappropriate development if another buyer snaps up the estate,
 which is on the open market.

The entire estate, which has been in the
 same family for generations, is on the market for £11.5 million but the
 National Trust has decided not to bid for the cottages in the village 
of Bantham, saying its core purpose was not to be a social landlord.

campaign to protect coastal areas, but urgently needs to raise another 
£2.6 million to buy the beach and estuary and pay initial management and
 conservation costs. 

'We're worried that someone from London will see an "opportunity". They'll kick the tenants out and turn the cottages into a boutique hotel,' said a resident

Until now, Bantham's owners have protected the unspoilt nature of the estuary and surrounding countryside, which is in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and avoided inappropriate commercialisation of the beauty spot

If it buys the land, it plans to maintain access for visitors and conserve the landscape of the flooded river valley, enhancing the oak woodlands that sweep down to the estuary and sowing wildflower rich meadows.

Mark Harold, National Trust director for the South West, said: 'This is a magical place, a true jewel on the South West coast.

'We now have a once in a lifetime opportunity to permanently secure and protect the landscape of one of the least spoilt coastal sites and secure its future for everyone to enjoy.

'If we don't raise the money then the future of Bantham beach and the Avon estuary is uncertain and this stretch of coastline might one day be disrupted by inappropriate management or development.'

If the estate were sold to a private owner, some level of access to the stretch of coastline would remain through the South West Coast Path

But access to the beach via a private road could be significantly reduced if a purchaser sought exclusive access and closure of the car park

But access to the beach via a private road could be significantly reduced if a purchaser sought exclusive access and closure of the car park, the trust said.

Joel Wakeling, a National Trust ranger who is from south Devon, said: 'When I think of Bantham I think of the golden sand and rolling Atlantic waves.

'Somewhere that I spent a lot of time when I was growing up, it's a place that means so much to so many.

'As someone whose heart and soul is connected to this very special stretch of coastline it would be amazing if the National Trust could raise the money to buy Bantham beach and Avon estuary.

Tom Doyle - managing director of Lloyds Property Group based in the famously wealthy Dorset community of Sandbanks discussed the property with his colleagues in Russia office and they were 'very interested'

Unspoilt: The Bantham cliffs, which could soon be sold off to developers

There are fears that the are could be sold to developers, as well as rumours that a number of Russian billionaires are interested in the estate

A Bantham resident told reporters: 'People are nervous, of course they are'

'I would then know that my children and children's children would be able to have the same experiences that I had growing up, and that everyone will be able to enjoy this special place forever.'

The proposed purchase would add to the 742 miles of coastline around England, Wales and Northern Ireland, including beaches, cliffs, islands, sand dunes and estuaries, which is cared for by the National Trust.

When the sale of the estate was first
 mooted, Tom Doyle - managing director of Lloyds Property Group based in
 the famously wealthy Dorset community of Sandbanks discussed the 
property with his colleagues in Russia office and they were 'very 
interested'.

'It
 would be very nice if everyone could get together to preserve Bantham 
and to protect it for our heritage, but at the end of day - if it is up 
for sale then someone's going to buy it and if it was to be sold to 
wealthy Russian it could be better than if it was sold to some British 
institution,' said Mr Doyle.

'A
 developer might look at it and say: "Let's knock it all down and turn 
it into some kind of holiday place",' he added, saying that many Russians
 had a special empathy and love for the British way of life.
