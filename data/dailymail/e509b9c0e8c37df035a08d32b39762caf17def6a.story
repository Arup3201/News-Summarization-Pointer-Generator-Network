Rolf Harris has made his first public appearance since his arrest over sex abuse claims became known. 

The Australian entertainer told the near sold-out audience at the Bristol Hippodrome how he coped with the allegations against him.

‘It’s not about waiting for the storm to pass,’ he said. ‘It’s about learning to dance in the rain.’

The 83-year-old received a standing ovation when he took to the stage amid cries of ‘We love you Rolf!’

And
in his first public reference to the claims against him, he read a note
of support from a couple he identified only as ‘Helen and Matthew’.

Wearing
a fluorescent pink shirt and black trousers, Harris won his first laugh
by telling the audience: ‘Thank you for your support. I will always 
wear it.’

He then launched into one of his signature hits, Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport, as the crowd clapped along.

Later Harris received a minute’s applause as he told the audience: ‘You have no idea what this means to have you all turn up.’

His gig at the 1,950-seat theatre, where
tickets had cost up to £35, was his first performance since it was 
revealed he had been arrested by Scotland Yard detectives conducting 
Operation Yewtree in the wake of allegations about Jimmy Savile.

He was arrested over ‘historic’ incidents on March 28, but no charges have been made.

Some fans admitted to mixed feelings. Roger Brabin, 65, from Liverpool said: ‘I’ve grown up with Rolf Harris. He’s a really talented guy.

'But I have to say I’m surprised he’s gone ahead with this show. Nothing is proven but he must have been affected by the innuendos.’

Harris denies any wrongdoing and his wife of 54 years, the Welsh sculptress Alwen Hughes, is thought to have attended last night’s concert backstage to support her husband. 

Earlier, a leaked email from his Sydney-based brother and manager Bruce Harris revealed the family’s frustration at the pace of police investigations.

Writing to a friend, Bruce said: ‘This has been dragging on for nearly seven months. The Plod in the UK are certainly taking their time.

‘We’ve been advised by Rolf’s top-notch legal team to sit tight and make no comment. That’s what we’ve been doing. I believe it will all be dropped.’

The allegations against Harris are not linked to the Savile case. Last month, detectives travelled to Sydney to interview a woman who claims she witnessed an ‘incident’ involving Harris two decades ago.

They subsequently interviewed a second woman.
