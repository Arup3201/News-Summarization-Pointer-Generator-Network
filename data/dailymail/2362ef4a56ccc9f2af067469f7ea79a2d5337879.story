Harry Kane took only 79 seconds to open his account for England, but there are two other players who took even less time to find the back of the net on their debuts.

The Tottenham striker continued his sensational scoring form this season by netting the final goal in England's 4-0 Euro 2016 qualifier defeat of Lithuania shortly after coming on at Wembley on Friday night.

However, the 21-year-old's strike was precisely a minute slower than legendary Spurs manager Bill Nicholson while John Cock also scored in less than half the time on his debut for the Three Lions.

England debutant's fastest goals:

Bill Nicholson                  19secs

John Cock                       30

Harry Kane                     79

Nicholson scored after only 19 seconds against Portugal in 1951. He remains the only player to have scored for England with his first touch in international football and subsequently never play at that level again.

Cock, who was also the first Cornishman to play for the national team, was on target after 30 seconds against Ireland in 1919. Cock would go on to win only one more cap, scoring against Scotland in 1920.

Kane had scored just one Premier League goal when Roy Hodgson's men last took to the field more than four months ago, but his rise has been so rapid that the striker's introduction at Wembley was met by a standing ovation on Friday.

Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck and Raheem Sterling netted the others, but the headlines belonged to just one man after this one-sided Euro 2016 qualifier.

Asked if he knew how long he had taken to open his account, Kane said: 'Maybe a minute? Eighty seconds? Hey, it's not too bad!

'It's the start I dreamed of, it's a little bit of a blur at the minute.

'It's the best moment by far, to represent your country at senior level is the top. Hopefully I can keep doing it and it's the first of many.'
