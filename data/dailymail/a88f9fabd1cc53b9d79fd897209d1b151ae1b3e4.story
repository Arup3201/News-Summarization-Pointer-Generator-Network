WITH whiskers spanning 12 inches across her furry face, this puss has more reason than most to feel, well, the catâ€™s whiskers.

Her only worry in life is she has no home.

Temporarily named after her most dominant feature, Whiskers is two years old and in search of a new owner.

Record-breaker: Whiskers the cat boasts facial hair measuring a staggering 12 inches from tip to tip

She is being cared for by the Cats Protection charity after her previous owner could no longer look after her.

The
 two-year-old black and white moggy, who is currently in foster care 
while she waits to be adopted, is a record-breaking cat, with what are 
believed to be the longest whiskers in Britain.

Whiskers, who recently had a litter of kittens, is now being looked after by the Cats Protection charity because her owner was no longer able to look after her.

But while all her babies have found new families to go to, poor Whiskers - whose whiskers are still growing - is still waiting for a loving owner to adopt her.

Volunteer Gill Canning, who is looking after the cat at her home in Frome, Somerset, hopes the cat's extraordinary claim to fame might attract someone to take Whiskers on.

She said: 'It was quite hard to measure her whiskers because she is so friendly, she thinks you are playing.

'They are certainly the longest whiskers I have ever seen and they make her look very pretty indeed.

'Her kittens had really long whiskers too, so I think it runs in the family.  She is a lovely friendly cat - very much a lap cat - and she is very playful.'

The title for the longest whiskers in the world is currently held by Missi, a Maine coon from Finland who boasts 19cm (7ins) long whiskers and has held the record since 2005.

But there is no contender for the longest in the UK.

Whiskers can live with other cats and is looking for a rural home in the Somerset area, and anyone wanting to offer her a home should visit: www.stray-cat.co.uk
