Hospital chiefs have told staff not to allow deliveries from a new Pizza Hut - despite it being built in their own multi-storey car park.

The move was revealed a month after the chain opened just 100 yards from the walls of Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, Devon.

Staff were instructed to tell patients they could not order from the fast food restaurant, with bosses steering them towards 'healthier' sandwiches in the hospital's smoothie bar instead.

Baffling: Chiefs at Plymouth's Derriford Hospital have told patients and staff not to order from a new Pizza Hut - in its own car park 100 yards away. The shop's Simon Wright (pictured) slammed the advice

But the advice in a weekly staff newsletter has baffled the shop's franchisee Simon Wright.

He insisted there had never been a similar problem elsewhere in Britain and 'a large part of our business comes from the hospital'.

The outlet had its grand opening last month on land which the Plymouth Hospitals Trust sold to regeneration firm Wharfside in 2006.

The developer built a 600-space multi-storey car park, which the hospital now pays an annual fee to lease back, and included units for several shops on the same site.

Wharfside's deal with Pizza Hut for one of the units - the first food shop to open - was agreed last year, and a Subway is soon due to open on the same site.

The hospital's 'ban' was revealed in a staff newsletter.

It said: 'The Trust has agreed with Pizza Hut and Wharfside that deliveries by Pizza Hut into the hospital will not be allowed.

'Please ensure this message is passed on to both staff and patients.'

Despite the objections of Mr Wright, a hospital spokesman stood by the edict.

She said: 'As part of our work around food hygiene and the control of visitors into clinical areas, delivery of takeaway food is not encouraged.

'The Trust maintains its commitment to improving healthy eating options for staff, patients and visitors.

'The hospital opened a Juice Bar in the main entrance of the hospital in March this year, which serves a range of smoothies and fresh juices alongside a healthier range of sandwiches, salads and pre-prepared fresh fruit pots.

'The Trust's main restaurant on Level 7 serves a variety of wholesome meals such as carvery, fish dishes, vegetarian options and has a daily salad bar.

A hospital in Surrey came under heavy fire when it emerged it had paid £24,000 to close a Burger King branch inside its own walls.

Croydon University Hospital had hosted the fast food chain in its entrance for 14 years, sparking the ire of health campaigners. 

It finally managed to close the outlet - which was next to posters promoting healthy eating - in 2011 and replace it with a Costa Coffee branch.

But in order to terminate the contract it had to pay £24,000 to Compass UK, the company operating the fast food franchise.

Croydon Health Service admitted the 'world had changed' since it signed the original deal in 1997.  

'The League of Friends shop, located in the main entrance at the hospital stocks a full range of fresh fruit and pre-packed healthy snacks such as nuts and raisins.

'Warren's Bakery Cafe in the main entrance also has a range of healthy soups, sandwiches, salads and fresh fruit on its menu.

'The proposed M&S Simply Food unit planned for outside the Trust's main entrance will further expand the range of healthier choices available to staff, patients and visitors.'

She added: 'The retail units are separately leased by Wharfside and the hospital has no say who leases these spaces.'

The new shop is run by Simon Wright, who has worked in the business since 2001.

'I don't know if this has come from the trust or someone internally off their own back,' he said. 'Maybe someone is not happy with us delivering within the hospital?

'In other parts of the UK it is no problem whatsoever and the business is essential.

'A large part of our business comes from the hospital and I don't know where this has come from.'

He added he had never agreed to restrict deliveries to the hospital and any such claims had been 'fabricated'. 

'We have been trying to contact the lady who wrote the newsletter with no success and find out what it's all about,' he added.

'There is definitely no agreement and I believe somebody at the hospital has been misled.' 

Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs Derriford, is facing a £13million financial black hole this year.

It received a boost to its finances when it sold the 16-acre site to Wharfside for £12.8million in 2006, and hopes to pocket about £100,000 a year for ten years when M&S opens in its entrance.
