Mo Farah will compete in the Bupa Great North Run on September 7, race organisers have announced.

The 31-year-old, who is gearing up for a 5,000 and 10,000 metres double at the European Championships in Zurich next week after pulling out of the Commonwealth Games following illness, will take on Stephen Kiprotich, the reigning world and Olympic marathon champion, on Tyneside.

It will be Farah's second attempt to win the Great North Run after he was beaten to victory last year by Kenenisa Bekele, with Haile Gebrselassie third in a thrilling race.

Farah said: 'I'm looking forward to returning to the North East to run my second Bupa Great North Run. I have been part of the weekend several times in the past, taking part in the mile and two miles races at the Great North CityGames on the Quayside.

'Last year was a great race with Kenenisa and Haile over the half marathon. I would like to come back and win this year.'

The race is set to be Farah's first on the road since his eighth-placed finish in the London Marathon in April.
