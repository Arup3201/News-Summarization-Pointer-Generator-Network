Al-Qaeda is now on Twitter.

Under the guise of its Shamukh al-Islam website, the official website of the terror organization, the terror group has now fired up its own Twitter feed, possibly in response to the effectiveness of terrorists live-tweeting the Kenya mall attack.

Having already issued 29 tweets ranging in topics from death tallies to religious proclamations, @shomokhalislam has almost 1,800 followers as of early Saturday morning.

The account’s opening signals a shift in the terror organization’s outreach, propaganda and basic communications efforts, according to experts.

Terrifying: al-Qaeda has started its own Twitter account

‘We’ve seen terrorist groups make increasingly effective use of social media, particularly Twitter and Facebook, in recent years,’ Patrick Poole, a counterterrorism expert, told the Washington Times.

‘Not only is this important for propaganda purposes but also recruitment.’

The Twitter account is not locked or kept private, and its followers appear mostly to be journalists and curious gawkers. The website is closed to the public.

Some of the postings, translated to English, are accounts of operations. Others are religious decrees and links to statements on the Shamukh al-Islam website and YouTube videos.

'Dear Brothers, the Mujahideen today are going through a period of great scrutiny and trial Be them good Nassara, and certain after God,’ read one tweet.

'Peshawar from New burn under the feet of the servants of worshipers of the cross, the explosive device was detonated now targeting Bus least the staff of the Ministry of Interior of Pakistan in Peshawar,' read another, before giving a death toll of 17, with 35 injured in the attack.

'The attack killed more than 17 people dead and inflicted 35 wounded in the initial toll expected to rise .. Source Brother Fadil Abu Maaz Kouhati,' said the most recent tweet sent from the account.

Though likely subject to intense intelligence community scrutiny, the account may seek to spread a more general message.

Despite well-known power struggles among different al-Qaeda factions, the Twitter account's administrator has pledged to remain neutral and focus on spreading the terror group's message, according to the Times.

'We’ve also seen divisions within these groups played out in social media, the most obvious example being the criticism on Twitter and YouTube directed at Al Shabaab leaders by former member American jihadi Omar Hammami, who had helped them develop their social media presence,' said Mr Poole

Twitter has yet to suspend the account as it did multiple al-Shabaab accounts during the Kenya mall attack.

By allowing the feed to remain up, argues another expert, Twitter is allowing al-Qaeda to further decentralize its powerbase and further streamline its communications.

'If the dissemination of official releases is no longer to be done centrally, it has the potential to make the forums obsolete and usher in a new era whereby jihadi activists primarily rely on social media platforms to interact with one another,' Aaron Zelin, a counterterrorism analyst, told the Times.
