Alex, 20, hopes to play cricket for his local team next year

A young apprentice has stunned doctors with an incredible recovery after a horrific crash which saw his car crumpled by a lorry.

Alex Shirra is back on his feet despite the smash that collapsed both his lungs, broke both his legs and put him in a coma for 12 days.

The apprentice electrician was so badly injured on July 15 last year two air ambulances were called to the scene just for him.

The 20-year-old was on his way to an awards ceremony and has bounced back so well that today he will be going to the same ceremony to finally collect his gong a year on from the crash.

Alex, from Ashton-under-Hill, near Evesham, Worcs was on his way to the same annual ceremony last year when his car hit a lorry on the A46 near Dumbleton.

The crash left Alex with a shattered knee cap, two broken legs, a broken wrist and a fractured collar bone.

Both his lungs collapsed, his spleen was lacerated he suffered a temporary brain injury.

The former pupil of Prince Henry’s High School, Evesham, was cut from his car and flown to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham.

He was in a coma for 12 days and in hospital for 14 weeks.

Incredibly just six months later Alex walking and now all his breaks have mended.

Alex, who lives with father Bill, mother Wendy and twin brother Adam, said the doctors had told him they were amazed by his progress.

He said: 'To think it’s a year on and I’m going to the same awards ceremony is amazing, it feels like an award for being alive too.

'I don’t remember anything from the crash, I didn’t remember much for a month, it was was very hazy because of the drugs and being so ill.

Both his legs, shown left and right, were badly broken in the collision which left Alex in a coma for 12 days

'They had two air ambulances come out for me because I was so bad in the crash, there was a doctor specially flown in just for me.

'I didn’t wake up like in a film, it was a gradual process, but when I walked in to see the doctors six months later later they were stunned.

'When I was in hospital I had physio every day, even from the second day when I was in a coma they were stretching me out.

Alex was so badly injured that it took two air ambulances to help him

Regular hospital visits from his family and his colleagues he says helped in with his speedy recovery

'My recovery speeded up again when I started to go back to work. I’m now working five days a week at my firm’s head office. I’ve tried working on site a few times but still find it difficult.'

Alex said his recovery was helped thanks to his firm Clarkson Evans, Gloucester, who even visited him in hospital.

Alex has been back behind the wheel for six months and says he is much more careful on the road now.

He later met the driver of the lorry, He said: 'He didn’t have a bruise but he was shaken up. He was amazed. He was saying it was an accident and it could happen to anyone.'
