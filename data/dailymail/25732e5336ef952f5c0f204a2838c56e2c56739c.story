Little chef: Theo Carnie with a cake he made but will not be able to eat because has a rare condition which means he has to be fed through a tube

For most, the best part of baking a cake is rushing to taste it after it comes out of the oven. 

But this pint-sized master chef has never been able to taste one of his own creations because he is unable to eat them.  

Due to a rare disorder, Theo Carnie cannot eat normal foods and relies on being fed a nutritious formula directly into his small bowel through a tube.

However, last week on his fifth birthday he was treated to two cakes – a real one which he gave to his friends and family as well as a replica model which he can keep to remind him of his special day. 

Theo's mother Verity Carnie, 37, said: 'Just because he can’t eat cake doesn’t mean we shouldn’t celebrate in the same way. It’s still important to have a ritual. 

'We all sang for him and he blew out his candles. He loves to bake and he’s not bothered about other people eating around him.'

Theo, from Outlane, Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, had to stop eating like most people when he was three years old because he kept vomiting every time he tried to digest food. 

He underwent surgery at Leeds General Infirmary in September 2009 which wrapped the upper part of his stomach around the lower end of the oesophagus and stitched it into place preventing him from digesting food normally.

This meant Mrs Carnie and Theo’s dad Nathan, 39, had to teach the youngster to take in his food through tubes leading to a backpack which feeds him. 

Mrs Carnie, a former children’s nurse, said: 'It is his lifeline, and provides him with all of his nourishment, and his medicine, and he has a hypoallergenic milk.

'He carries a little back-pack around with him which contains his special food and his pump and he just gets on with it.

'Truthfully, he was so young when he had the operation that he’s never looked back and we find ways round the food.'

Mr and Mrs Carnie don’t hide food from him and amazingly, Theo loves to cook, despite being unable to eat the results. 

'His favourite chef is Jamie Oliver,' said Verity. 

'He loves to cook and he’s always baking or helping me make meals.  

'Theo is perfectly happy to be around others when they are eating, and food is still part of his life - we don’t hide away from him when we’re eating.

'We do go out for meals and don’t hide away. He comes with us and we take lots of things in a bag so he can sit and play – it’s just part of life.

'Even when we spend time in hospital they cook with him.'

Theo still has to attend Great Ormond Street Children’s Hospital (GOSH) to have treatment.

General practitioner Nathan said: 'The staff at GOSH are fantastic and they make his visits very relaxed for him.

'He just carries on and smiles, and it’s the best place for him to be because of all the research they do.

'We have been through a massive amount which I would not wish on anyone but it has to be worked out what is best for him, and that’s what they are fantastic at doing. 

'We are lucky that we are in the best hospital in the country.'

Mrs Carnie added: 'Theo is so amazing because he just gets on with it and he has such a massive zest for life and loves his friends and family.

'He doesn’t get upset and he doesn’t make a big deal out of it. He’s an incredible little boy.
