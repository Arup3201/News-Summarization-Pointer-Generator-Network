World welterweight champion Kell Brook will fight Canada-based Romanian Jo Jo Dan in his first fight since being stabbed in the leg last September, it has been announced.

The 28-year-old will defend the IBF belt he won with victory over Shawn Porter in August at the Motorpoint Arena in his hometown of Sheffield on March 28.

It is a delayed first defence because of the injuries Brook suffered when attacked while on holiday in Tenerife soon after his title victory.

Brook sustained serious leg injuries after being struck by a machete but now feels ready to return to the ring.

The 28-year-old said he was the 'victim of an unprovoked attack' in the early hours of September 4, when a conversation between himself and his attacker in the assailant's apartment, following an evening of drinking, turned sour.

Brook lost a lot of blood and had no feeling in the affected area, but has recovered sufficiently to line up a title defence.

Speaking at a press conference in Sheffield, Brook said: 'It will be emotional, after winning the world title last year but then a few weeks later having an horrific knife attack.

'I was wondering if I would walk again, never mind fight, but now I am feeling fit.'

Dan, 33, is Brook's mandatory IBF challenger, although the fight is a voluntary defence. Dan has won 34 of his 36 bouts and beat Canadian Kevin Bizier in his last outing in December.

Brook boasts a clean 33-0 record and hopes to move on to challenge the likes of Amir Khan and Floyd Mayweather further down the line.

He said: 'I am getting the mandatory out of the way. I am after those massive fights - you all know the names - later in the summer, but I have to get this one out of the way first, and he is a tough customer.'
