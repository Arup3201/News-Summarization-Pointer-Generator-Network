Dumped on farmland, it could have been mistaken for a shaggy piece of old carpet. 

But look closely and you will see that it is in fact an abandoned dog with fur so overgrown and matted it could barely walk. 

Only his nose was visible beneath the tangle of hair thick with dirt and debris.

Abandoned: Dr Brenda Gough and her team of vets helped to save this neglected dog found in farmland near her home

Despite the shocking neglect, the dog which has been called Shrek, was rescued and given a new home as well as a new haircut.

The puppy was found by veterinarian Dr Brenda Gough's husband who spotted it on the family farm in Ontario, Canada.

He took the dog to his wife's nearby veterinary practice, Park Road Veterinary Clinic, where vets spent hours shaving 3.5lbs off his matted coat. 

‘The little dog looked like a swamp creature, hence the name Shrek.

Neglect: Only his nose was visible beneath the tangle of matted hair, thick with dirt and debris

Vets spent hours shaving of more than 3lbs of matted hair which had stopped the dog from being able to walk

'He was terrified, shaking horribly, and
 we couldn’t tell if he was ill or injured, only that he couldn’t run 
very far because the matts were not only so heavy, they had caked his 
legs together,' Mrs Gough told the Metro.

The little dog now has a Facebook page where fans have been leaving their well-wishes.

'He is still terrified and nervous, but looking for human contact, and learning all about love', said Dr Gough. 

It is believed 12 more dogs have been found to be living in poor conditions at puppy mill nearby.
