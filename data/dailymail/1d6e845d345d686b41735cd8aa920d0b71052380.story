Hundreds of brides were left devastated yesterday following the collapse of a wedding company.

Jenna Batty, 26, is among up to 170 brides who had their wedding plans thrown into disarray after booking A Little Bit of Bling to put the finishing touches to their venues.

Some only realised the firm was not going to deliver on the morning of their wedding day while others claim they are owed thousands of pounds.

Devastated: Jenna Batty and Ian King from Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, saw their wedding plans left in tatters as a company they had paid to organise decorations folded on their big day - and left them to find out via a Facebook post

Scores of brides have now joined forces to report the company to police, trading standards and Action Fraud.

Bride-to-be Jenna paid the company £1,400 to provide the decorations for her wedding on October 12 at the Buchan Braes Hotel in Peterhead, Scotland.

She and fiance Ian King selected bouquets, centrepieces, chair covers, a chocolate fountain, starlit backdrop and Mr and Mrs signs.

But Jenna was devastated when she saw a post on Facebook from the company stating that it had ceased trading, leaving her with a frantic scramble to make alternative plans.

Her disappointment turned to anger when she realised how many other couples had been let down by A Little Bit of Bling, which is based in Dudley, West Midlands.

No refund: Sarah Broadley was left in tears when decorations she had paid for didn't turn her wedding day. She and husband Ben paid their venue £300 to help fix the mess. A Little Bit Of Bling is yet to reimburse the couple

Jenna, of Peterhead, said: 'Some of the money is not that much but it is promises and dreams that have been smashed by this.

'It was a one-stop shop to get everything. It looked like it was a beautiful business.

'We paid £1,400. We had literally invested everything on thinking she was going to come and do our wedding. It’s been really stressful.' 

Mother-of-two Jenna, who has been with Ian, 29, for three years, asked for a refund and has contacted police to report what happened.

'Floods of tears': Caren Larkman-Ayre and Jonathan Ayre from North Yorkshire were devastated to find at 8.30am on the day of their wedding that they would not receive their candy cart, chocolate fountain, chair covers and sashes after paying £484 to A Little Bit Of Bling

She said she was 'very lucky' that her local community has rallied round to help her source replacement decorations.

Devastated Caren Larkman-Ayre was told at 8.30am on the morning of her dream wedding that A Little Bit of Bling had left a message with a night porter to cancel.

She had paid £484 for centrepieces, a candy cart, chocolate fountain and chair covers and sashes in her navy blue colour scheme for her wedding at Hazlewood Castle in North Yorkshire.

But she was left in floods of tears after being left in the lurch, and had to make do with mismatched decorations sourced on the day of the wedding to her groom Jonathan Ayre.

Excuses: Some of the brides were told by Sarah Cawthorne, the owner of A Little Bit of Bling, that she was struggling to cope with her business commitments due to ill health

The mother-of-one said: 'I was devastated, heartbroken. I lost a good couple of hours on my wedding day crying and in my pyjamas trying to get everything organised.

'I ended up with a mish-mash of centrepieces. The sashes didn’t match.'

Bride Sarah Broadley was also left in tears on the morning of her wedding on September 20 after A Little Bit of Bling failed to turn up with the decorations she had chosen.

She eventually received a message from the company blaming a 'family emergency' for its failure to make it to her wedding venue in Dudley, West Mids.

The hotel made last minute arrangements to make sure her 4pm wedding to fiance

Ben, 32, went smoothly, but she had to pay an extra £300 for their help.

Office administrator Sarah, 31, said: 'I was just a mess on the morning. It was just awful.

'To look at it from somebody else’s point of view they would not have known, but I knew what I had ordered and what should have been there.

'The staff at the hotel were brilliant. Although the morning was awful, my wedding was wonderful.'

Three days after the wedding, Sarah received an apologetic message stating that the company had filed for bankruptcy. She has not been refunded the £180 she paid.

She has joined more than 100 angry brides on a Facebook group set up to fight for refunds and organise complaints to the police and trading standards.

Let down: A Little Bit of Bling failed to provide the finishing touches such as flowers and centrepieces to hundreds of brides

Some of the brides were told by Sarah Cawthorne, the owner of A Little Bit of Bling, that she was struggling to cope with her business commitments due to ill health.

Yesterday Mrs Cawthorne admitted failing to honour bookings but said she had refunded five brides.

Mrs Cawthorne denied that up to 170 couples have been let down, and said bookings for 102 receptions will be honoured by another company, Paradise Weddings of Solihull, West Mids.

She said: 'I have had to retire from business due to ill health on the advice of my doctor.

'I have depression and anxiety arising from business pressures and family matters. I had to close my Facebook page down after receiving death threats to myself and my children.

'Now I just want to get better and look after my family.'

Dudley Metropolitan Council’s Trading Standards division confirmed it is investigating a number of complaints.

Councillor Tracy Wood, cabinet member for environment and culture, said: 'We have to date received 14 complaints against the company relating to customers who did not receive the wedding services they had paid for.

'Officers have worked closely with the company to arrange refunds for a number of individuals. Anyone with concerns should contact Dudley Trading Standards on 08454 040506.'
