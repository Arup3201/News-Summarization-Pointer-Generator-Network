Baby Gammy has had an eventful first 12 months.

The Down syndrome baby, who was abandoned in Thailand by his Australian surrogate parents, found himself at the centre of a media storm earlier this year.

But on Tuesday - his first birthday - Gammy is a happy, healthy little boy who lives in a new house with his loving family and likes playing with his older brother and sister.

They live in a comfortable house paid for using part of the $250,000 raised for the family through public donations, which has new furniture, a television set, and plenty of kids' toys.

And apart from a few minor hospital visits the family lives a normal life, even going on trips to the beach together.

Peter Baines, founder of the charity handling Gammy's medical and living expenses, said the family had been doing well since moving into their new home in October.

'Gammy's had some health issues and that's not to be unexpected, but they're certainly in a better space then they would have been,' said Mr Baines, of Hands Across The Water.

'He had a repeat of a lung infection and spent a few days in hospital.

'Nothing as severe as what it was the first time and certainly it was treated a lot quicker and recovery was a lot better than what it was.'

Mr Baines added that Gammy loved playing with his siblings.

'He's just a healthy, happy boy who loves interacting with his brother and he's got a beautiful personality about him,' he said.

'It's not right he be defined by health issues, or what happened to him, or the fact that he's got Down syndrome.

'He's getting fat like a little one-year-old should, now he's over the worst of his health issues.'

Earlier this year Gammy's Thai surrogate mother Pattaramon 'Goy' Chanbua and Gammy found themselves at the centre of an international row over the ethics and legality of surrogacy when it emerged Gammy's Australian parents David and Wendy Farnell abandoned him in Thailand but took home his healthy twin sister Pipah. 

Gammy has an ongoing lung condition which sees him need hospital treatment from time to time

Baby Gammy and his mother Pattharamon 'Goy' Janbua moved into a new house in October

Almost half of the $250,00 raised was spent on the three-bedroom house, where the pair will live with Goy's husband, grandparents and two other children, 100km south of Bangkok

Mr Baines said 21-year-old Goy – who has looked after Gammy since his Australian parents left him – was also coping well after an intense year.

'She's really good, she's in a good space, and I've always said when you look at her level of education and her life and you look at what she's had to deal with I think she's dealt with it remarkably well,' he said.

Mr Baines said that of the $250,000 raised for Gammy, about half of the money was spent on the family's new three-bedroom house.

There is $120,000 left over to cover the one-year-old's future medical and living expenses 

 Before moving into the new home Gammy was in hospital for six days due to a lung infection

Mr Baines said the family needed a new home because their previous one-bedroom unit was too run-down for Gammy, who still suffers from a lung condition.

Earlier this year Goy and Gammy found themselves at the centre of an international row over the ethics and legality of surrogacy when it emerged Gammy's Australian parents the Farnells abandoned him in Thailand but took home his healthy twin sister Pipah.

The house for Gammy's family was purchased and is being held under a trust in the name of Hands Across The Water, which is managing the family's money on behalf of Goy.

Gammy, Goy, and Goy's husband, grandparents and two other children moved into the home earlier in the year.

The house is in the same neighbourhood as the family's previous residence, in an industrial area about 100km south of Bangkok, where they also ran a small shop selling salads and noodles.

Mr Baines described Gammy as: 'a strong little boy who certainly appears healthy and full of life'

Mr Baines said: 'we anticipate the original donated funds being sufficient to see Gammy into early adulthood'

Earlier in the year, Hands Across The Water administered $20,000 towards Gammy's medical costs, including moving him from a public to a private hospital, when he was suffering from a lung infection
