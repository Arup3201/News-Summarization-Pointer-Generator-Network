Aldean posted on his Twitter account and website today in the wake of the tragedy.

He wrote: 'With a heavy heart, I'm sad to say that a man passed away last night after stepping out in front of my bus in Indiana. In all the years I've been touring and all the miles we've driven, nothing prepares you for something like this to happen. I'm praying for Albert Kennedy's family and friends today and ask that you do the same.'

Aldean is a three time Grammy Award nominee and has won multiple Country Music Awards.

He and ex-wife Jessica Ussery filed for divorce in April after the singer admitted to acting 'inappropriately' with another woman in a bar.
