An emaciated boxer dog - its bones clearly visible beneath its fur - stares sadly into the camera after being rescued.

He is one of two boxers, two-year-old brothers, which were rushed to a veterinary centre run by the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ISPCA) for life-saving treatment.

They feature in a new episode of TV3-show Animal A&E, which investigates the 'epidemic' of unwanted and discarded dogs in Ireland.

Malnourished: The ribs on this neglected boxer dog can be clearly seen through its fur after it was rescued by the ISPCA

The dogs were filmed being treated by ISPCA staff, as the show's presenter Andrea Hayes and the team look on.

The horrifying state of the animals reflects the plight of a growing 'epidemic' of discarded dogs that are dealt by the ISPCA's officers.

The programme, which airs tomorrow at 7.30pm also features a small terrier named Memphis which had been dumped over the eight foot-tall security fence at Ireland's Dog's Trust charity - despite the building being open to the public at the time.

Ms Hayes said: 'We went to the ISPCA 
centre in Longford and we got a call to say two boxer dogs had been brought in. They were 
among the most severely neglected dogs the inspector had seen.

'They were completely anaemic and severely malnourished. It would have taken quite a lot of time to get them so starved.

'They had sores on their body which showed their skin was a closed to the bone as it could get.'

ISPCA Inspector, Conor Dowling said 
'irresponsible' dog ownership is a 'major animal welfare issue in 
Ireland with far too many owners not embracing concepts such as 
neutering and microchipping.

'We produce far too many puppies in Ireland,' he said, 'and this is reflected in the cases of canine cruelty and neglect that we encounter on a daily basis and the numbers of dogs discarded in our pounds.'

Mark Beazley, executive director of the Dogs Trust said: 'Unfortunately, we are seeing over 1,200 stray and abandoned dogs coming through our doors every year.

'People are still taking on the responsibility of dog ownership without enough consideration of what it entails,' he said, 'a dog is for life.

'We hope that by working with organisations such as TV3 and the ISPCA we can highlight this issue and inform the public to really think about what is involved in owning a dog for life.'

The two boxers featured on the show have recovered from their ordeal and are due to be re-homed.
