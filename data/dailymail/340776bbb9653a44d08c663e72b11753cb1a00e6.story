The controversial 'Pick Up Artist' Julien Blanc who has sparked worldwide outrage after a video emerged of him strangling a woman was mentored by a fellow 'dating guru' who apparently bragged about raping a stripper.

Blanc. from Los Angeles, now faces a ban from entering the UK to hold a series of workshops after Liberal Democrat Lynne Featherstone, said she was lobbying Home Secretary Theresa May to refuse him a visa.

But Blanc is not alone in advocating his aggressive approaches to meet women. He was taught by the founders of Real Social Dynamics, Nick Kho and Owen Cook.

Outrage: Julien Blanc was thrown out of Australia and faces a ban on entering the UK after video footage shows the 25-year-old 'dating guru' using racist language and grabbing women by the throat

Predator: One comment posted on his Twitter feed stated: 'Dear girls, could you please save me the effort and roofie (spike) your own drink? #JustKidding'

Cook – who also goes by the alias Tyler Durden, after Brad Pitt’s character in the movie Fight Club – appears in a video from one seminar telling of his pride at forcing a stripper into having sex with him.

In an expletive filled tirade - recorded on video - he tells his crowd: ‘She was a stripper... I f*****g hated that f*****g b***h.

‘The last way I f****d her too … I just threw her on the bed and I put it in her, and I could barely even get it in because she was just totally not in the mood.

‘And I was like, "F**k it, I'm never seeing this b***h again. I don't care.'

‘So I just like, jam it in, and it's all tight and dry and I f**k her.’

Jennifer Li, a woman from Washington, D.C. who has launched a campaign against RSD, tweeted the video on November 7. She added: 'It looks like RSD's founder Owen Cook admitted to rape in this clip.'

The video has since disappeared from YouTube. 

While Blanc is listed as an Executive Coach on RSD's website, Cook is his superior, a co-founder of the company with the title of Executive Producer.

The Canadian, who now lives in California, was one of the first to comment on Blanc’s now notorious video, made in Japan, where he encourages men to grab hold of random women by the neck and push them toward their crotches.

Blanc said that: 'At least in Tokyo, if you're a white male, you can do what you want.'

Shockingly, Cook said he felt the video was 'pretty tame by Julien's standards'.

'I hated that b***h': Cook, originally from Canada, was recorded on video recounting how he forced himself on a stripper. Critics of RSD said it amounted to an admission of rape

Girlfriend: Cook has been dating Roxanna, above, for four years and has a son with her - who he told an audience was a 'mistake'. Roxanna also works with RSD advising men how to pick up women

Surprisingly for a pick up artist, Cook is father to a four-year-old son, Vincent, who he had with his long-term girlfriend Roxanna, who also works for RSD.

The company offers young men coaching seminars around the world, charging around £1,200 for tips on how to date women. 

Cook appeared in one video with his son. He introduces Vincent to the crowd, pats him on the head, before saying: 'You were an accident. You were an accident.'

Alongside Cook, co-owner Nick Kho – known in the pickup artist community as ‘Papa’ – appears to take more of a backseat in the operations. 

He married documentary-maker Amber Holmes, who claims to run a female equivalent company to RSD called Lovelogica, in 2012. A dating website review website says his claim to fame is having taken the phone number of Paris Hilton twice - but never dated her.

He declined to defend his company’s practices when contacted by MailOnline for this article.

RSD's cadre also includes Executive Coach, Jeff Allen, who is notorious around San Francisco’s Mission District for driving his brightly decorated vehicle, which he refers to as his 'rape van', from which he hurls abuse at women who reject him during dates.

Too late: Blanc appeared on CNN to apologise for the video in a desperate attempt to dampen global anger

One woman who met with Allen at a tapas bar he frequents has described how things took a turn for the worse when she refused his advances.

Jolene Parton wrote on her blog that after she had left his company he texted her almost immediately saying: 'Kill yourself n****r. You're pathetic. The cognitive dissonance must be killing you.'

The spotlight was thrown on Blanc and RSD last week when the video in Japan went viral on the internet.

Footage shows the 25-year-old Mr Blanc using the racist language and apparently grabbing women by the throat. 

His other proposed methods include threatening to commit suicide and isolating women from their friends.

One comment posted on his Twitter feed stated: ‘Dear girls, could you please save me the effort and roofie (spike) your own drink? #JustKidding’ . 

A blog post describes how to use ‘use coercion and threats’ and ‘emotional abuse’ to control women.

A blog post by Blanc explains how to use ‘use coercion and threats’ and ‘emotional abuse’ to control women

It states: ‘Makes threats to hurt her; make her drop charges; make her do illegal things; threaten to report her to welfare; prevent her from taking a job; take her money and humiliate her.’ 

In the wake of the media storm around RSD, the company has remained silent, although Blanc has appeared on news network CNN, where he apologised for the content of his past seminars.

He said: 'I am extremely sorry. I feel horrible. Those pictures that you're referring to, like choking women, I just want to make that clear, that is not what I teach. Those pictures are a horrible attempt at humour.'

Whether it does anything to quell the outrage over Blanc and RSD remains to be seen.

He was forced to leave Australia last week when his visa was cancelled. A similar campaign was mounted to bar him from Canada.

A petition calling for him to be refused entry to the UK has received more than 136,000 signatures.

The woman behind the petition, who goes by the pseudonym of Caroline Charles said: 'Julien Blanc dresses up his seminars as dating advice, which at best is disingenuous - he focuses on tricking women into having sex in order to make money.

'It is wrong on every level - it is promoting violence against women and girls, it takes advantage of men and it sends a message to survivors of sexual assault that they will not be listened to. To allow someone into the UK who is explicitly promoting these things is abysmal.’

Other commentators have suggested that the campaign against Mr Blanc merely generates him unwarranted publicity.

Money maker: RSD rakes in £1,200 a person at seminars around the world attended by young men desperate to be successful at the dating game

Blanc’s company, Real Social Dynamics, runs three day courses costing around £1,200. His company is due to host a two day course starting on 27th November and another from December 19. Eleven more events are scheduled for next year.

Mrs May can use discretionary powers to ban anyone for reasons of 'unacceptable behaviour'.

The Home Office refused to comment on the specific case for legal reasons. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘The Home Secretary has the power to exclude an individual if she considers that his or her presence in the UK is not conducive to the public good.’

Mr Blanc’s representatives did not respond to requests for comment.
