Floyd 'money' Mayweather reportedly laid down a whopping $5.9 million bet on Miami Heat winning last night's basketball game - and they did, earning him a cool $6.49 million profit.

Boxing extraordinaire Mayweather - the highest earning athlete in the world - put down the bet on Game 7 between the Indiana Pacers and the Heat, Vegas Gambling Steam tweeted before the game.

LeBron James' team were a seven-point favorite against the Pacers, and luckily for Mayweather, the team ended up destroying their rivals 99-76, doubling the sports star's money.

Mayweather apparently made the eye-boggling bet just after he signed a six-fight $200 million with Showtime and agreed to fight Canelo Alvarez in September for some $40 million.

The sports star is no stranger to gambling, and winning, but even for him the almost $6 million wager is extreme.

Vegas Gambling Steam broke the news of the eye-boggling bet on Twitter.

'Good source from my #HeavyHitters Vegas crew alerted me that Floyd Mayweather has laid over $5,900,000 on Heat -7 tonight in Vegas,' the tweet read.

'This is kind of ridiculous. C'mon 
Floyd,' Benjamin Lee Eckstein of AmericasLine.com, a 
nationally-syndicated odds column, told the New York Daily News.

'I
 know that there have been people who walked into a casino and bet a 
million dollars, but not on basketball. It was always the Super Bowl.'

According to Vegas Gambling Steam, Mayweather had to spread his wagers across nine sportsbooks.

'I don't think that anybody's taking a six million dollar bet at one shot,' Eckstein said. 'You'd probably have to call (Vegas mogul) Steve Wynn personally for that.'

Mayweather enjoys sharing his winning and losing tickets on Twitter, but he's yet to brag about picking the victorious team last night.

Between August 2010 and and February 2012, Mayweather had a nearly flawless run, tweeting photographs of 46 betting slips, totaling $3,890,833 worth of bets, and 'every single one of them was a winner, netting the fighter a cool $3,938,722 in winnings,' according to a story on Grantland.com.
