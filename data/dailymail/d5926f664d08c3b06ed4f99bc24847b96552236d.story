Britain's plus-size women feel so neglected by the country's high street stores that they have stopped following fashion, says a new poll.

More than 10million women in the UK are now a size 16 or larger -  40 per cent of the population - the country's stores are still failing to cater for the them. It seems a foolish oversight, given the market is forecast to make over £6 billion in 2014.

The survey, by Australian fashion 
retailer Taking Shape, shows curvier women feels completely ignored by 
most British fashion retailers.

Plus size women now feel abandoned by the British high street, with many deciding to shop online or in supermarkets instead of facing the embarrassment of asking for help in stores 

The poll also revealed the nation's favourite celebrity plus-size women, with 
included Dawn French the most popular, raking in more than half of the vote, with 
TOWIE'S Gemma Collins, Hollywood actress Melissa McCarthy and 
ex-Emmerdale star Lisa Riley rounding up the top four.

Some 90 per cent of women larger than a size 14 claim they feel unwanted by the high street, with two-thirds claiming the current plus-size range and sizes on offer are poor. 

Shoppers now feel so out of place in these shops that only one in 10 would even ask for help from a retail assistant, believing that the typically slim young women working in fashion stores are unable to relate to their needs. 

More than two-thirds are also avoiding the changing rooms in favour of their bedroom, because doors or curtains in the store changing room do not provide enough privacy.

Despite some retailers like Debenhams catering for larger ladies, with bigger mannequins in store (pictured), 9 out of 10 plus size women believe their needs are completely ignored by UK shops 

The range of clothing is so dire in many places that 93 per cent of women buy their new outfits with the main aim of covering up body parts, with a dismal 7 per cent paying any attention to fashion trends. 

And these attitudes are hitting the stores where it hurts most - the cash tills. 

Because shoppers are so embarrassed about being seen buying a new wardrobe, they are now heading in their droves to online stores or picking up items from supermarkets during the weekly grocery shop. 

One of plus-size women's major bug bears is lack of or size of curtains or doors in shop changing rooms, which is causing many women to avoid high street chains completely 

The survey also showed up some interesting attitudes of plus size women to their bodies, with the majority labelling their stomachs as their worst asset, with breasts being seen as the best. 

Plus-size retailer Taking Shape undertook the survey in order to find out women's attitude to fashion for larger ladies. 

Comedian Dawn French came out top in the poll of favourite plus-size female celebrity, while Hollywood funny woman Melissa McCarthy was also in the top five 

It has now opened 18 stores across the UK, with clothing offered in sizes 14 to 26, and is hoping to convince Brits to give shopping another chance. 

Alla Buinowicz, Managing Director of Taking Shape, said: 'I am staggered by this research.

'Millions of women in the UK have been left in the cold by the major high street chains and, unsurprisingly, they have abandoned shopping on the high street. 

 'These curvy British women feel unwanted and they are certainly unrepresented. 

'So many British women have frankly given up on fashion. 

'I want these ladies to come into one of my Taking Shape stores and rediscover their fashion mojo. 

'All women should feel comfortable shopping for new clothes in store without dreading the experience.'
