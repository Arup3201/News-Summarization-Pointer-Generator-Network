DJ Ray Teret, pictured outside court today, raped a teenager who responded to his magazine advert looking for 'the next teenage pop sensation', a jury has heard

A DJ - accused of raping a 15-year-old girl with Jimmy Savile - attacked another teenager who responded to his magazine advert looking for 'the next teenage pop sensation', a jury has heard.

Former Radio Caroline DJ Ray Teret, 72, raped the 17-year-old who was given a 'promise of the dream' of fame and fortune but ultimately the defendant did not find the budding singer 'a jot of work', Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court was told.

Teret, then aged in his mid-50s, was said to have impressed the girl when he took her to his house in the mid-1990s and showed her a Porsche car, gold and platinum discs and lots of photographs on the walls of him with famous people.

Tim Evans, prosecuting, said he went on to tell the youngster 'there were lots of things potentially happening career-wise' and she needed to be in the 'bright lights of Manchester'.

It led to 'a big send-off' from her family as Teret collected her and drove her to his flat where he raped her after she had red wine for the first time and became drunk.

The alleged victim was said to have gone 'into a bit of a lockdown' as she submitted rather than consented to sex, the court heard

Teret then gave her £40 to buy a new dress, said Mr Evans.

Only 'the promise of the dream' persuaded her to stay as Teret continued his abuse, he added.

Mr Evans said: 'She got to the stage where she protested and his answer to that was telling, you may think. He would say that she was too attractive, her fault then, and more significantly that he couldn't do things for her without it happening.

'Could he make it any clearer to this 17-year-old girl who had not got the fame promised, that sex was the price for the fame she wanted.'

He went on: 'And the fame and fortune promised? Teret didn't find her a jot of work. Was providng her with work ever what he was truly interested in?'

Teret, of Altrincham, Greater Manchester, denies 18 rapes, two other serious sexual assaults, one attempted rape, 11 indecent assaults and two counts of indecency with a child. 

The historical offences dating back to 1962 are in relation to 17 different girls.

Two other men are also on trial with Teret.

Alan Ledger, 62, from Altrincham, denies a serious sexual assault, two indecent assaults and one count of indecency with a child.

William Harper, 65, of Stretford, denies one count of attempted rape.

Mr Evans told the jury: 'All of the witnesses talk of the various ways in which they have been affected. Depression, anger, feelings of worthlessness, relationship problems, how it has affected their attitude to sex and the like.

'Some had counselling, some did not. But each was to a greater or lesser extent affected by what they say Mr Teret and these other defendants, and other men not on trial, did to them all those years ago.'

Yesterday, when opening his case, Mr Evans said Teret took a naive 15-year--old girl to a flat in the Manchester area in a bubble car in 1963 or 1964 and she 'couldn't believe it' when she found Savile was there.

Savile then raped the girl, followed immediately by Teret, he said.

Mr Evans said Teret then told her: 'You should be thanking us because we have made it easier for when the next person goes there.'

He said Savile had put his hands up her skirt, pulled her knickers down, pushed her down on the bed and then raped her.

Teret was said to have had a 'deal of celebrity' in the '60s and '70s, especially in the Manchester area.

He said he worked at the pirate station Radio Caroline and Piccadilly Radio.

The prosecutor said: 'The Crown's case, in a nutshell, is that he used the celebrity that he had to abuse young girls in various ways and that the other two defendants - Mr Ledger and Mr Harper, friends and associates of Teret - also became involved on occasions.'

He told the jurors that they were not tasked with determining the scale of Savile's abuse and that the defendants should not be contaminated 'because of the spectre of Savile'.

Today, outlining more of the allegations, Mr Evans said one complainant aged 12 or 13 was encouraged to introduce her friends, also complainants, to Teret.

She said she first met Teret at a record shop he ran.

The complainant said she went on to regularly meet him at his flat and was said to have 'frozen' as Teret took her virginity.

Mr Evans said that on one occasion Teret committed a serious sexual assault on her while club DJ Ledger held down her hands.

The prosecutor said Teret took a naive 15-year--old girl to a flat in the Manchester area in a bubble car in 1963 or 1964 and she 'couldn't believe it' when she found Jimmy Savile (pictured) was there

When interviewed, the complainant told police that she recalled there was a wall in Teret's flat with graffiti on it which contained names, messages and phone numbers.

The prosecutor said the jury would hear that, years later, the police were able to find such a wall and photographs of it would be shown during the trial.

She said Teret would ask her to take friends of her own age to the flat and that she regularly attended in school uniform.

Mr Evans said she ended up having sex with Teret until she was 15 and said the defendant was capable of kindness and could be charming and funny.

The prosecutor said: 'The evidence of (the alleged victim) paints a terrible picture of depraved conduct, does it not? This is someone who became locked into a world where all values were utterly distorted, where Teret's kindness to her was used to achieve sex, her loyalty to him and, you may think, her hero-worship of him was such that she would continue to be involved with him and, much worse, she would even ask her friends to get involved.'

One of those friends went on to be abused at the age of 13 by Teret and Ledger, according to the Crown.

Mr Evans said this complainant was another 'young, naive, vulnerable' girl who was 'to a greater or lesser extent starstruck and charmed'.

Another friend introduced to Teret at the age of 14 would record jingles for one of his radio shows and would be given free records.

'All of this led her and her friends to feel privileged and important because after all Mr Ray Teret was famous,' the prosecutor said.

It led to her calling regularly at his flat and she was said to have been asked to give 'a special knock on the door' when she went round.

Teret raped her one night as she recalled trying to fight him off, the court heard.

Mr Evans said: 'He told her not to be scared and told her he was doing her a favour.'

The same woman said that Ledger also indecently assaulted her and Teret aided and abetted the rape of her by a man called Pete.

The next complainant said she was raped aged 13 by Teret and that on a separate occasion Harper - a DJ and presenter who went by the stage name of Tony Grey - attempted to rape her.

Mr Evans said the girl was sent by Teret on 'a false errand' to collect a book from the home of Harper who tried to have sex with her before it was thought his mother interrupted him, the Crown claims.

Teret was said to have raped another 13-year-old girl whom he met when he compered a talent show, while another girl aged 13 or 14 was raped after she met him in a pub.

She went on to tell the police that she had only kissed a boy before having sex with Teret.

Mr Evans said: 'She had said nothing during sex with Teret 'because he was a man and I was a kid and I wouldn't, I just wouldn't have said anything, I would have just done as I was told but I would have felt wrong saying something to someone that much older than me'.

Another complainant, aged 15 at the time, recalled being indecently assaulted by Teret in his car at a time when he was a DJ on Signal Radio in the Staffordshire area.

Mr Evans told the jurors that they would also hear evidence from witnesses about the Manchester club scene in the 1960s and 1970s, properties where Teret lived, cars he drove and places he worked.

When interviewed following his arrest, Teret said he had used a bubble car driven by Savile but did not pick up any girls in it, said Mr Evans.

Teret said he had never taken a girl from a club as described by numerous complainants and would not even be allowed to kiss girls in Savile's clubs because he forbade it.

The defendant went on to say that teenage girls did nothing for him, said the Crown.

But Mr Evans told the jury: 'In light simply of the evidence you will hear in this case, the Crown say that young teenage girls, far from doing nothing for him, were consistently pursued by him through the '60s and '70s.'

The trial continues tomorrow when the first of the complainants will begin to give evidence.
