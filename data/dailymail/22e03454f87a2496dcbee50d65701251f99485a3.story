The mega-club is threatening to overtake gambling as Las Vegas' most lucrative draw-card, with nearly 30 per cent of casino-goers preferring to dance than bet.

Analysts say gambling is no longer king in post-recession Sin City, as a new influx of younger tourists spends less on the slots and more on luxury shopping, concerts and clubbing.

Desperate to cash in on the emerging 'club bubble', casino programmers are fiercely competing to
offer novelties that party-goers would never see at their local dance 
spot.

Club bubble: Sin City now boasts 21 of America's 100 most profitable nightclubs, including the five-story Hakkasan at the MGM Grand

This shift in the structure of the Vegas economy began about 10 years ago but has recently accelerated, according to Center for Business and Economic Research director Stephen P. A. Brown.

While Vegas' sprawling casinos 
accounted for 59 per cent of total revenue on the Strip in 1984, 
gambling contributed just 36 per cent last year.

Even
though more visitors than ever are hitting Vegas, they are spending 
less money per trip - $1,021 per visit in 2012 compared with $1,318 in 
2007.

'Gaming went down more than total visitor spending, by a greater percentage,' Brown told New York Times.

'The visitors who have come back are here for clubs and shopping. They’re buying swimsuits to go to the day clubs and evening clothes to go to the nightclubs. That’s the big growth.

'I think what’s going on here is we’re seeing a shift away from Las Vegas as the only gaming destination in the United States to being one of many gaming destinations. But it is holding up as a tourist destination.'

Some of the biggest casino owners which are
saddled with debt, including MGM and Caesars Palace, are tapping into 
the booming nightclub business to attract more tourists.

Vegas now boasts 21 of the country's 
100 most profitable nightclubs, according to the trade publication 
Nightclub & Bar.

The town also dominates the top 10 spots, with 
seven clubs bringing in more than $25 million a year.

The other three 
clubs with earnings in the same range are LIV and Mango's Tropical Cafe 
in Miami Beach, and LAVO in New York City.

But New York Times reported Vegas officials are worried the 'club bubble' could be nothing more than a flash in the pan that will hurt the city in the long-run.

In the meantime, clubs are ramping up their efforts with more extravagant shows and big-name performers.

'Clubs want to add an extra element of wow,' Mary Canavan, owner of the laser company YLS Entertainment Inc, said.

'It used to be you were lucky to have two lasers on your show. Now you might have 26.'

Pauly Freedman, director of operations for Encore Beach Club, Surrender and Andrea's at the Wynn Las Vegas, said clubs are offering the 'full package'.

'The DJs come in and they have their music, but they're also bringing lighting directors in,' he said.

'So it's up to us when we're working alongside them to make sure we have the latest and greatest in our clubs.'

Last month, Surrender distributed 3D glasses at the door so dancers could take in the graphics popping out from behind DJ Morgan Page.

Freedman is currently awaiting a new LED wall making its way on a boat from China. He promises it will be the brightest in the city.

At Flutter Fetti, which provides confetti for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, the new thing this year is canons that sync automatically to a DJ's music, so that dancers are covered in metallic strips just as the track reaches its climax.

'Casinos need to create a celebration, and our products create the celebration,' CEO Ronee Holmes said.

Several clubs are investing in individual confetti canons, cardboard tubes that range from $1 to $6 each.

Hakkasan at MGM Grand likes to give a tube to everyone who walks in the door, Holmes said.

Ghostbar at the Palms has purchased branded confetti throwers emblazoned with the club's name.

Canavan's laser installations might cost a club $9,000 for the night, but with table service starting at $10,000 at many Las Vegas venues, it's a small investment.

Of course, everyone has a competitor. The laser vendors are worried about clubs embracing CO2 as an alternative stimulus overload. Many clubs have begun periodically spraying bursts of icy air into the faces of sweaty dancers.

For the confetti contingent, the concern is indoor fireworks. Luckily, most casinos still ban those.
