An extraordinary diagram that charts in chilling detail the outcome of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor has emerged after 72 years.

The colourful battle map was drawn up in the wake of the surprise attack on the American Pacific Fleet and shows the sheer devastation inflicted.

It was produced by Lieutenant Commander Mitsuo Fuchida who led the 400 Japanese fighter planes on the mission and who gave the famous radio signal 'Tora! Tora! Tora!

The diagram shows more than 60 US ships at anchor in the harbor and most are marked in different symbols to show the extent of the damage they suffered.

A key-code down one side records the types of munitions used and the damage inflicted, under the categories minor, moderate, serious and sunk.

One of the most famous ships attacked 
at Pearl Harbor was the USS Arizona. It has four red dots on it and 
three red lines running through it to show it was seriously damaged.

In
 fact the Arizona was sunk in shallow water and was the only battleship 
that couldn't be raised. It is now a permanent memorial to the 1,177 men
 on board who were killed.

One of the eight battleships attacked was the USS Oklahoma which has a large red cross through the middle of it to show it was sunk.

Twelve red arrows pointing to its starboard side indicate the number of torpedos that struck it.

Ahead of it is the USS West Virginia which also has a red cross, nine torpedo arrows and three red dots which show it was hit by three bombs.

Next to that is the USS California that also has a red cross and three red dots.

So detailed was the report, Lt Cmdr Fushida even added plumes of large orange flames and smoke to many of the ships for added effect.

It was used by the Japanese officer during a presentation he gave to Emperor Hirohito on the successful attack three weeks later.

The document is marked 'Top Secret' and is titled 'Estimated Damage Report Against Surface Ships on the Air Attack of Pearl Harbour.'

The map is incredibly accurate in terms of the positions of the 60 ships and Lt Cmdr Fushida was about 80 per cent correct in his results.

After the war he became a Christian evangelist and bizarrely settled in the US.

He gave the document, that measures 2ft 7in by 23ins, to the historian Gordon Prange when he was interviewed by him in 1947.

Mr Prange kept it for over 40 years until it was acquired by the late magazine magnate Malcolm Forbes.

His family have now sold it at auction where it fetched £260,000.

Patrick McGrath, a books and manuscripts specialists at auctioneers Christie's, said: ‘It is a remarkable artefact from World War II.

‘It was very exciting to deal with such an historic document. It brings you right there at that moment in history.

‘In his autobiography, Fuchida said he felt his diagram was about 80 per cent accurate.

‘It was based on the action reports compiled on board an aircraft carrier following the attack.

‘He described unfolding the layout in front of the Emperor and using his finger to point at the relevant places on the diagram, giving a blow-by-blow account.

‘It is remarkably detailed.’

The attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii resulted in 2,402 U.S. servicemen being killed and almost 20 ships being sunk, destroyed or badly damaged.

The Japanese believed the success of the attack would prevent the Americans from entering the war in the Pacific between Japan and China.

But it had the opposite effect and the Americans were able to salvage and repair almost all of the ships that were sunk or damaged and by 1944 they were all back in use.

He underestimated the damage done to the USS Arizona, which he thought was damaged, but was actually sunk
