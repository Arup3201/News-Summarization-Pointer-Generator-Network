Lindsay Vonn has compared herself to Tiger Woods' wife in an interview given while she supports her boyfriend during a dismal performance at the U.S. Open.

The apparent slip of the tongue might surprise Woods, not to mention his recent ex-wife Elin Nordegren, as Vonn and Woods have been dating just three months.

The 28-year-old Olympic skier has become something of a fixture on the golfing circuit as she has been pictured keeping a close eye on Tiger at various courses.

During a quiet moment at Merion Golf Club in Ardmore, Pennsylvania on Friday, Ms Vonn said that she didn't give the champion golfer advice about his game but that she was a sounding board for him as 'lots of people go home and talk to their wife or 
husband about their job'.

Tiger tamed? Tiger Woods, pictured on Sunday at the U.S. Open at Merion Golf Club in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, might be surprised to hear that girlfriend Lindsay Vonn compared herself to his wife

She told the New York Times: 'We talk golf after his golf rounds, but mostly I listen. We really are
normal in that way. Lots of people go home and talk to their wife or 
husband about their job. That’s what we do.'

Woods had a lot of ground to make up on Sunday in Ardmore, Pennsylvania after he skidded to seven bogeys and a 6-over-par 76 on Saturday.

Woods tumbled down the leader board and matched his worst round as a pro at the U.S. Open.

Ms
Vonn was more of a casual presence on the sidelines than at previous 
competitions. The
Olympic skier has been dressed casually in a T-shirt, jeans, 
sunglasses and baseball cap from her sponsor Red Bull as she closely 
tracked Woods around the course.

She tweeted on Thursday: 'Day one here we go!' before posting several pictures of golf fans' muddy feet at the rain-sodden course.

At the Masters in Augusta last month, Ms Vonn turned heads at the course in a clinging beige floor length dress and coordinated sunhat.

However it appears that being relegated to the role of golf WAG is rather irksome to the glamorous Miss Vonn whose last appearance with Woods was at the Council of Fashion Designers of America Awards in Manhattan.

She also told the Times:
'Some people seem to forget that I’m not just Tiger’s girlfriend. I’m 
actually a successful athlete. I’m Lindsey. I have my own career and my 
own life.'

She added that 
she was 'very happy' and that despite the constant attention that has 
come with dating the world's most famous golfer, the relationship is 
'worth it'.

Woods is currently ten strokes behind 
third-round leader Phil Mickelson, the only player under par at the 
short but devilishly tough Merion Golf Club.

Despite leading the PGA Tour in putting in recent weeks, Woods needed 36 putts on the severely undulating greens.

He blamed his inability to gauge the speed of those baffling putting 
surfaces for his three days of uneven play - and he was right.

Woods
is tied for third in fairways hit and 22nd in reaching the greens in 
regulation. But he's averaged 32 putts per round, which left him tied 
for 53rd in the field of 73 players.

Afterwards, he said: 'It's certainly frustrating because I was feeling like I was playing well this week and I just didn't make the putts I needed to make.

'The first two days, I had, like, three 3-putts and I was four shots off the lead, and I missed a boatload of putts within 10 feet.

'So I really wasn't that far off. If I clean up the round and don't 3-putt, I'm one shot back starting out today. Basically, I just didn't have the speed right this week and it certainly showed.'

This U.S. Open marks exactly five years since Woods won his last major, at Torrey Pines, which he captured in a playoff against Rocco Mediate, despite hobbling around with ligament damage. His pursuit of Jack Nicklaus' career record of 18 majors remains stalled at 14.

Woods also shot a 76 in the final round at Shinnecock Hills in 2004, as well as two rounds of 76 at Winged Foot in 2006 when he missed the cut.

Woods' worst round ever at an Open was a 77 at Oakland Hills in 1996, when he was a 19-year-old amateur.

What made his performance here perhaps even more surprising is that Woods has already won four times this season, including The Players Championship - sometimes called golf's fifth major - and three of his last five starts.

Most recently, however, Woods stumbled to an 8-over-par finish and a tie for 65th at the Memorial, a tournament he'd won five times.

Woods said several tough pin placements chosen by the U.S. Golf Association's course set up compounded his problems trying to figure out the speed of the greens.

'Look at what they did at (Nos.) 7 and 8 today. Couple short holes, but 7 is one step and a half over the top of the ridge. Eight is on the down slope a little bit, and it's a pretty steep slope. So they got some really tough ones out there,' he said.

But Woods' also conceded he rarely put his approach shots into those greens where he should have.

'If you put the ball in the right spots you've got uphill putts and you can be really aggressive,' Woods said.

Woods now faces the prospect of beginning the final day of yet another major with only the longest of shots to contend. What little consolation he could muster came when someone asked: 'Tough day?'

'Yeah,' Woods replied. 'At least I started well.'
