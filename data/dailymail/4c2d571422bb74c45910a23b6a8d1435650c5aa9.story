The crippled Costa Allegra cruise ship will now not reach land until at least Thursday.

Its 1,049 passengers face another 72 hours onboard the stricken liner - where fresh food has run out and they are being forced to stay out on deck at all times.

A trawler is today towing the stricken luxury liner, following an onboard engine room fire that left it drifting powerless in the pirate-infested Indian Ocean.

It was initially heading towards the island of Desroches, where it was expected to dock this afternoon.

But Costa Cruises has now revealed it will proceed to the Seychelles capital of Mahe, because of 'safety and security issues', where it should arrive in two days.

A statement said: 'The disembarkation in Desroches does not assure the necessary and adequate security conditions for mooring the ship and guests’ disembarkation. 

'In addition, logistics and hotels on the island are not enough. Thus the ship will be towed to Mahe also with the assistance of two tugs that are approaching the ship and that would allow to increase the speed.'

The Allegra suffered an electrical 
blackout following a blaze below decks in the engine room at the back of
the 187metre ship yesterday.

It is part of the same Costa Cruises fleet as the ill fated Concordia, which hit rocks last month leaving more than 30 people dead after partially sinking.

Although no-one was injured in the latest incident, Costa Cruises was moving rapidly to deal with the situation as the 28,500 ton ship, carrying 1,049 passengers and crew, had been left with no power. Emergency generators are providing a small amount of light and working satellite phones.

A helicopter has ferried in fresh food and new batteries for the Allegra as it was being towed by the French ocean going trawler Trevignon.

Thirty one British passengers are among holidaymakers onboard and to combat the heat as air conditioning is not working, they have all been gathered on the outer decks of the ship.

The 48-year-old has been at sea for 20 years and was promoted to captain last summer, taking charge first of the Costa Marina before taking the helm of the Allegra.

Captain Alba, who is from Monopoli near Bari in southern Italy, is in constant touch with coastguard officials in both Italy and the Seychelles.

He is also in contact with the skippers of the tugs and trawlers sent to tow the Allegra back to port following the blaze that knocked out all onboard power.

Today his wife Mariangela Mele said: 'The situation is under control, I am not worried but I have not yet had a chance to speak with my husband.

'The last time I heard from him was just before the fire. He called me as he always does at 9am in the morning and the fire started a couple of hours later.

'In our phone call he said that everything was fine and other than that I don't know anything else. I know as much as is in the papers and all my information is coming from Costa Cruises.

'I just want to hear his voice so that I know everything is OK and I hope that later this afternoon I will be able to speak with him - that's why I can't really speak on the telephone for long. I need to keep the line free.'

In a statement Genoa based Costa Cruises
said they were 'all served a cold breakfast' while the Allegra's 
captain Nicolo Alba was in constant touch with the Trevignon and 
maritime authorities.

Italian coastguard officials in Rome who are co-ordinating the rescue have said the Allegra is in no immediate danger and she is 'upright and floating', adding that weather in the area was calm with the odd shower passing through.

Onboard the Allegra, which was a week into a month long cruise of the Indian Ocean, Red Sea and the Mediterranean, are nine Italian marines from the elite San Marco regiment, who are armed with Hecker and Koch submachine guns and who ready to defend the ship from possible pirate attacks.

The area off the east African coast has been targeted by Somali pirates in the past and the marines are there as a deterrent - they are from the same unit which was involved in a shooting incident earlier this month, which left two Indian fishermen dead earlier after their trawler approached an Italian tanker.

The ship had been due to make its way north through the Indian Ocean with stops in Mauritius, Madagascar and the Seychelles before heading to Oman, Jordan, Egypt and finally ending in the Italian port of Savona on March 17.

Costa sources said the most likely cause of the fire was an 'electrical fault' and that it would be thoroughly investigated.

The ship was originally built as a container vessel in 1969 and called the Annie Johnson before being sold by its Finnish owners to a Greek company and eventually Costa in 1990 where it under went a two year refit and was relaunched with its new name Allegra.

It also emerged today that the three 
Costa directors involved in dealing with the Allegra incident - Roberto 
Ferrarini, Paolo Parodi and Manfred Ursprunger - are the same three who 
are under investigation for their involvement in last month's Costa 
Concordia tragedy.

The captain of the Concordia, Francesco Schettino, is also under investigation after he recklessly changed course so the ship could carry out a sail by salute of the Italian island of Giglio but it struck rocks tearing a 70 m gash in its hull and is now lying partly submerged on its side on rocks.

Schettino is facing accusations of multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck, abandoning ship with passengers still onboard and failing to communicate properly with maritime authorities.

On Saturday a preliminary hearing is scheduled to take place at Grosseto, north of Rome, with prosecutors taking over the town's theatre as a makeshift court room as dozens of passengers who were on the Concordia are expected to attend although the proceedings will be mainly technical.

Mark Thomas spoke of his disbelief at hearing his daughter is stranded on the Costa Allegra just weeks after his son was trapped on its doomed sister ship the Concordia.

His son James, 19, was hailed a hero for forming a 'human climbing frame' to help terrified passengers escape from the Concordia when it hit rocks off the Italian coast in January.

Yesterday the 48-year-old was told his daughter Rebecca, 23, was stranded on the Allegra.He said: 'We just can't believe it and are absolutely amazed that this has happened again.

'We can't put it into words. I was really worried when I heard because of what James went through.

'At least James was in a better situation with the Concordia because it was so close to the shore.

'But it's worrying because Rebecca is in the middle of the ocean and we don't really know exactly what is going on.'

Both James and Rebecca are employed by the Italian cruise firm as dancers. Mr Thomas, from Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, said he and his wife Jayne had spoken to an agent from Costa.

They realised their daughter's plight when they heard about the ship's power failure, after a blaze in the engine room, on the television.

Jayne, 48, added: 'I just can't believe it's happening all over again - it's like a nightmare.'

And she revealed she had been in contact with her daughter three or four times a day, last speaking via mobile messenger service WhatsApp yesterday morning.

Among the other Britons on board is Hannah McDermott, from Salford, Greater Manchester.

Her mother Christine Hargreaves said: 'I know the ship is being towed away now so I feel quite relieved about that but I just want to know she is OK. As a mum, I just want to hear her voice.

'I last got a message from her at 8am yesterday but haven't heard from her since and both her phones are off.'

Costa officials were last night locked in discussions over the compensation package that  would be offered to passengers.

Last month it offered payouts of £9,319 to more than 3,000 passengers on the Costa Concordia.

The total bill is expected to top more than £30million.
