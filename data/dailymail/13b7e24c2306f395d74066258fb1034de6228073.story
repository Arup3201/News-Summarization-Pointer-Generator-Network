An American contractor has been killed in Kabul by a policewoman who is said to have mental problems.

Authorities also revealed the killer was an Iranian who moved to Afghanistan ten years ago using false documents provided by her husband.

The shooting, on Christmas Eve, is the first by a woman in a spate of insider attacks by Afghans against their foreign allies.

The policewoman walked into a heavily guarded compound in the centre of the Afghan capital and shot 49-year-old Mr Griffin, a civilian police advisor, with a single bullet.

According to an interior ministry 
spokesman the woman, a mother-of-four in her early 30s, joined the 
police five years ago and had a clean record.

‘Her mental condition is not good,’ he said, describing her behaviour as ‘unstable’.

Under interrogation she said her plan 
had been to kill either the Kabul governor or  police chief but when she
 realised that security was too tight, she saw ‘a foreigner’ and turned 
her weapon on him instead.

The woman, identified as Afghan 
police sergeant Nargas, had entered the strategic compound in the heart 
of the capital and shot the adviser with a pistol as he came out of a 
small shop with items he had just bought.

The policewoman - who like many Afghans only uses her first name - was taken into Afghan custody shortly after the attack.

Earlier, she had asked bystanders where the governor's office was located, Kabul governor Abdul Jabar Taqwa said.

The killed adviser was a contractor whose identity was not immediately released.

The attack occurred outside the police
 headquarters in a walled, highly secure compound which also houses the 
governor's office, courts and a prison.

Kabul deputy police chief Mohammad Daoud Amin said an investigation was under way.

Mr Amin said Nargas, a mother of four, had worked with a human rights department of the police for two years and had earlier been a refugee in Pakistan and Iran.

Aftermath: U.S. and Afghan security personnel escort a convoy into the compound as investigations begin

Captured: Officials in the capital have said the policewoman is being held in custody

She could enter the compound armed 
because as a police officer she was licensed to carry a pistol, the 
police official said. Mr Amin did not know whether the killer and victim
 were acquainted.

Canadian 
Brig Gen John C Madower, a command spokesman in Kabul, called the 
incident 'a very sad occasion' and said his 'prayers are with the loved 
ones of the deceased'.

A
 Nato command spokesman, US air force Lt Col Lester T Carroll, said: 'We
 can confirm that a civilian police adviser was shot and killed this 
morning by a suspected member of the Afghan uniformed police.

It came just hours after an Afghan policeman shot dead five of his fellow officers at a checkpoint in northern Afghanistan.

Senior
 officials have described killing as an 'insider attack' - when Afghan 
security forces turn their weapons on coalition troops or foreign 
contractors.

At least 53 international troops have been killed by Afghan soldiers or police this year and a number of other assaults are still under investigation.

Nato
 forces, due to mostly withdraw from the country by 2014, have speeded 
up efforts to train and advise Afghan military and police units before 
the pull-out.

The surge in insider attacks is throwing doubt on the capability of the Afghan security forces to take over from international troops and has further undermined public support for the 11-year war in Nato countries.

More than 50 Afghan members of the government's security forces also have died this year in attacks by their own colleagues.

Taliban militants claim such attacks reflect a growing popular opposition to both foreign military presence and the Kabul government.

Nato said around 25 per cent of insider attacks are by Taliban infiltrators, with the rest being borne out of personal animosities or cultural differences. 

In an earlier attack, a policeman shot dead five colleagues late last night in the Jawzjan province.

Officials said he then stole the officers' weapons and fled to join the Taliban.
