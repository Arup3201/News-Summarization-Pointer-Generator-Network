Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp said his side's football was 'pointless' after they fell to their fifth defeat of the season on Saturday.

A 2-1 loss at Cologne plummeted the club into their 'worst situation in years', in the words of director of sport Michael Zorc, and Klopp did not beat about the bush either.

'We played a kind of football which is absolutely pointless,' he said at the post-match press conference.

'We misplaced so many passes in the first half and made simple mistakes which can be explained in a whole host of ways, but still should not be happening.

'We've just got to face the music once again.'

The afternoon had started out so well for Dortmund fans, who saw Ilkay Gundogan lining up for the first time in 14 months and both Marco Reus and Henrikh Mkhitaryan back from injuries.

The return of that trio appeared more to unsettle the side than to help them out of their current crisis, which has instead thickened.

'We just made it too easy for our opponents,' Klopp moaned. 'We've got to eradicate these mistakes. Not tomorrow, not the day after but straight away.

'We are almost always scoring goals and if we didn't concede any, then the situation would look completely different.

'We've got to resolve this and nobody's going to help us.'
