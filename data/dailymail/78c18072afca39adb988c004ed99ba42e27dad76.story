If you’ve ever wanted to have a draught beer machine that works as well as a Nespresso coffee maker, then Heineken may have the answer.

The Dutch group has teamed up with Apple industrial designer Marc Newson to create a home draft beer gadget named ‘The Sub’.

The company claims it will allow anyone in the world to experience different types of beer that may otherwise be unavailable in draught form.

In a recent interview with Dezeen, Mr Newson who described himself as a ‘consistent beer drinker’,

‘I guess you may ask "what's the point?",’ Mr Newson told the website.

‘The point is that draft beer is fundamentally for people that like beer and drink beer, and who know that draft beer is far superior to beer that you will get in a can or a bottle.’

The 16-inch (41cm) device looks like a metal beer cask with a tap connected at one end. The body sits on a base and it has a red button at the front to switch the device on.

Having beer on tap was once a distant dream for many.

But the rise of the Kegerator – a combination between a keg and a refrigerator – has meant that freshly poured, draught beer is being enjoying in homes across the country.

The concept was born out of the DIY skill sharing community when those desperate for beer on tap found ingenious ways to get it by re-engineering their fridges.

And it quickly caught on commercially. For instance, Wisconsin-based Nostalgia Electronics is now offering its ‘Kegorator Beer Keg Fridge’ for around $600 (£360).

The pressurised system claims to keep beer carbonated for weeks and has a portable unit with rolling casters to move it to any location.

Henieken's latest is more portable and cheaper at  €249 (£195).

It can be filled with Torps, which are pressurised modules that hold two litres of beer, with different types ordered from the company.

The Torps are placed horizontally into a circular compartment in the middle of the machine.

One of the biggest advantages of the Sub is that it will enable home drinkers to pour themselves the exact amount of their preferred beer.

"My wife for example, who loves beer, doesn't ever drink a whole can of it. Half a can will sit there, get warm and get thrown out," Mr Newson told Dezeen.

"This enables you to have any amount of beer, you could have a thimble full if you wanted and it would be as good as a big glass."

The Sub costs €249 (£195) and is a development from a similar product launched by Heineken 10 years ago.

It is currently available in a ‘Signal Black’ edition across France and Italy. It will go on sale in the UK next year, but other markets have yet to announced.
