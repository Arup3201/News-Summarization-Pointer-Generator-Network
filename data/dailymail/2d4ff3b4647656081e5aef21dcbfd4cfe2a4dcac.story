It has been home to dolphins, piranha fish and even blood-sucking eels, but the River Thames has never before seen the like of this giant hippo.

City workers and tourists had to double take yesterday morning when the 68-foot wooden animal floated up London's famous river.

The huge sculpture - named HippopoThames - is a new art installation for the capital by Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman.

Londoners and tourists watched as the 68-foot HippopoThames - a new art installation for the Totally Thames festival - was towed into position yesterday

Artist Florentijn Hofman says he was inspired to produce the hippo after hearing the creatures actually lived in the Thames in prehistoric times when Britain was hotter

It was towed through the Thames Barrier, under Tower Bridge and past the Houses of Parliament on its way to its mooring in Nine Elms on the south bank yesterday.

The creature will be positioned at the site until September 28 and will be accessible to the public at low tide.

Mr Hofman is best known for his huge rubber duck, which was taken around Europe, North and South America and the Far East before famously deflating in Hong Kong last year.

The new artwork was unveiled as part of Totally Thames, a festival celebrating one of Britain's most famous rivers.

The animal was first taken through the Thames Barrier in Woolwich, south east London yesterday morning before being towed up through the centre of the capital

The sculpture was taken by two tug boats along the famous river, past the O2 Arena in north Greenwich, formerly known as the Millennium Dome

Rotterdam-based Mr Hofman said he was inspired to make the artwork after hearing that hippopotamuses inhabited the Thames in prehistoric times.

He added: 'I am thrilled and excited to be using the Thames as the location of my first UK commission.

'The purpose of setting my sculptures in the public domain has always been to give members of the public a break from their daily routines, to inspire conversation and to cause astonishment.'

Dolphins and porpoises are regularly seen on the river, with a pod of five spotted last year. In 2004, a piranha landed on a Thames Bubbler boat in Dagenham and in 2009 a sea lamprey, a prehistoric eel-like creature with a sucker-shaped mouth, was found by fishermen.

Workers in the Canary Wharf financial district were left shocked as the 68-foot long hippo was towed past the windows of their tower blocks yesterday morning

It was taken to its mooring at Nine Elms, near Battersea Power Station, where it will be on display this month and accessible to the public during low tides

Mr Hofman became famous after his huge rubber duck was towed around the world's harbours

His previous artwork is perhaps best known for deflating in Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour last year
