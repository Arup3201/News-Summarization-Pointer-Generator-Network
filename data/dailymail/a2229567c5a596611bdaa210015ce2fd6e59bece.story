Rescue crews have called off their search for a 43-year-old man who was swept out to sea while helping with a baptism ceremony at a California beach yesterday.

Benito Flores was dragged into the ocean with two other people during the 10am service at the Rancho Guadalupe Dunes Preserve, but only he failed to return to shore.

Pastor Maurigro Cervantes, who was performing the ceremony, said he tried to grab Flores, his cousin, but the ocean's pull was too strong.

'AÂ  big wave came and took Benito. I tried to take him out - he was heavy - and then another big wave came,' Cervantes, the pastor of Santa Maria church Jesus Christ 
Light of the Sky, told KCOY-TV.

About 25 people who attended the ceremony watched in horror as Flores was overcome by the waves, unable to save himself.

Santa Maria Times reported rescue crews scoured the beach for hours, including fire crews from Barbara County, Guadalupe, Vandenberg and Santa Maria and the Santa Barbara County Search and Rescue team.

Helicopters from the county Air Support Unit and the Coast Guard, in addition to a Coast Guard vessel from Morro Bay, participated in the search.

Diondray Wiley, a battalion chief with the county fire department, said the search focused on an area south of the spot that the man disappeared because of the ocean currents.

However Fire Captain David Sadecki said the search was called off last night, noting it would be difficult for anyone to survive more than 30 minutes in the cold water.

Cervantes said his cousin was helping him baptize a man in his mid-20s at the coastal park. The pastor said he performs baptisms at the beach several times a year.

Park authorities warn on their website that the surf at the reserve, just south of the town of Guadalupe, can be 'very dangerous'.
