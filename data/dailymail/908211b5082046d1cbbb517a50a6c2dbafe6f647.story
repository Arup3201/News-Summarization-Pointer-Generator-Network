A 31-year-old man appeared in court charged with the murder of his own twin brother on New Year's Eve.

Robert Cerqua, a plasterer, is accused of stabbing Chris Cerqua after an argument at the family home in Hythe, Hampshire, at the end of 2013.

He spoke only to deny the charges in the hearing today at Winchester Crown Court.

Police rushed to the terraced home where Chris live with the brothers' parents, and found the wounded man severely injured. He was taken to hospital but died an hour later.

Denis Cerqua, 49, and her husband Peter, 59, were in court to see one son deny killing the other.

In the brief hearing, prosecutor Nicholas Haggan QC told Winchester Crown Court no more details of the case would be revealed at this stage.

The fatal stabbing allegedly occurred at around 9pm on December 31 last year ,when the brothers got into an argument.

Paramedics took Mr Cerqua to Southampton General Hospital in a desperate, and unsuccessful, bid to save his life.

'Argument': The killing allegedly took place at the brothers' family home in Hythe, Hampshire

Officers from Hampshire Police arrested Cerqua five miles away at 2.25am in the town of Totton, near Southampton, on suspicion of murdering his sibling.

Chris, described as 'thoughtful and caring' by loved ones, had recently got back together with girlfriend Lisa Harfield, 40.

Miss Harfield, a receptionist, and Mr Cerqua split in October, but reunited and planned to view a new flat on New Year’s Day.

Speaking at the time, Brenda Smith, chairman of Hythe and Dibden Parish Council, said the death was ‘tragic’ and ‘deeply regrettable’.

Cerqua, from Hythe, Hants, has short shaven hair, is of slim build and has a tattoo on his neck.

Judge Keith Cutler adjourned the case for trial at Winchester on October 6.
