Friends and fellow tennis players Serena Williams and Caroline Wozniacki will play against one another on Sunday in the U.S. Open's women's final.

'She's a good friend of mine,' said former world number one Wozniacki, who has never won a Grand Slam title. 

'We were saying when the tournament started, 'We're in separate sides of the drawing, so hopefully we can meet in the finals. It would be great if that were to happen.' 

Williams said she had the same thought when the draw was made.

'She obviously wants to win and go for her first grand slam, and I want to win and try to make a little history,' said Williams, who wants to end a disappointing grand slam season on a happy note by claiming her 18th slam singles to tie Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova for fourth on the all-time list.

In it to win it: Caroline Wozniacki won her match against Peng Shuai, who broke down in scary distress due to heat illness and retired in the second set, while trailing 7-6(1) 4-3

Go for it! Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark is set to play in the women's final for the US Open against her good friend Serena Williams 

In June, the two women were seen hanging out together in South Beach - as part of the same trip in which Williams crashed a beach-side wedding.

They also seemed to be close after Wozniacki's fiance Rory McIroy called off the couple's engagement this spring. 

'It's a hard time for me right now,' Wozniacki tweeted in May. 'Thanks for all the sweet messages!Happy I support Liverpool right now because I know I'll never walk alone.'

In reply, Williams wrote 'I'll always walk with you,' including face and footprint emojis, along with the hashtag '#friendsforever.'

Wozniacki told The Guardian in June 'She's always been there for me whenever I've needed her.

 'It's great that you have such an amazing competitor … after everything that she's achieved in her professional career, that she finds time. She wants to help out a friend who needs it sometimes.' 

On Friday, top-seeded world number one Williams beat Russian left-hander Ekaterina Makarova 6-1 6-3, who is the 17th-seeded player. 

Wozniacki advanced when China's Peng Shuai broke down in scary distress due to heat illness and retired in the second set, while trailing 7-6(1) 4-3. 

The opening semi-final produced some scary moments as China's Peng fell victim to the severe conditions during an energy-draining, groundstroke battle with Wozniacki.

The match was still very much in doubt with Wozniacki serving at 4-3 and facing break point when the unseeded Peng suddenly grabbed her thighs and stumbled to the back wall of the center court with what appeared to be severe cramping.

In obvious distress, the 28-year-old doubles specialist was eventually helped off the court to be evaluated by doctors.

A valiant Peng, playing her first career grand slam singles semi-final, refused to quit and returned in 11 minutes after a medical examination.

Six points later, Peng curled up in agony on the baseline, and officials called the match and Peng was lifted into a wheelchair and taken from the court to a standing ovation after the abbreviated two hour four minute battle.

Victory: Serena Williams is all smiles after her win Friday 

'The doctor, she said to me, "You are not able really go out to fight, compete, because look is not really well,"' Peng said about the medical evaluation when she met reporters after two hours of treatment.

'I said, "No, no, no, I don't want to give up. I want to try one more time,"' added Peng. '"And then I come back."' 

Williams, the two-times defending champion, came on the center court next and seemed determined to spend as little time as possible in the heat and succeeded, trouncing Makarova in 60 minutes.

The American blasted 24 winners, including five aces. Makarova hit six.

'I'm just really excited to be in the final. In the beginning of the week I definitely wasn't sure I would make it this long. So I'm just elated,' said Williams, who failed to reach the quarters in any of the year's previous three slams.

Makarova, playing in her first slam singles semi-final, praised the victor. 'Serena, she's a great, unbelievable player. Today she was so aggressive.'

Friendship will be set aside in Sunday's final between the players who earlier this year spent a beach holiday together in Miami with some serious chips on the line.

'I'm in the finals, which is obviously great,' said Wozniacki, who lost the 2009 final to Kim Clijsters. 'It's been five years for me since my last one here, so I'm extremely happy to be back.

'I would love to win it and have a grand slam under my belt. It would definitely have the media stop talking about my lack of a grand slam, so that would be nice.

'The friendship, while we are on court, is put aside. We are both competitors,' added the Dane. 'After the match, one of us is going to congratulate the other and we're going to be friends again.

Williams was in agreement.

'Regardless, I'm going to be happy with the outcome,' she said.
