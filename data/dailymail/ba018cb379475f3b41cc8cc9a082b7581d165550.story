A young mother told she would die within 12 months from brain cancer has walked down the aisle after beating the disease with a controversial cure.

Laura Hymas, 27, was told on Christmas Eve three years ago that she had an incurable brain tumour.

But the mother-of-one refused to give in and with the help of partner Ben, raised £75,000 to fund gene therapy treatment in Texas which is not available in the UK.

The treatment replaces faulty cancer genes with new ones but lacks clinical efficacy and has been condemned by conventional medicine, with critics arguing the therapy is unproven.

It is offered at the Burzynski Clinic, which is best known for the known for the controversy surrounding its 'antineoplaston therapy', a chemotherapy using compounds it calls antineoplastons, devised by the clinic's founder Stanislaw Burzynski in the 1970s.

However, a year after her treatment Miss Hymas says was told her tumour has completely gone and she is cancer-free.

And last month she fulfilled her dream of marrying Ben with their four-year-old son Jacob as a page boy.

Miss Hymas, from Rochester, Kent, said: 'I feel so lucky to have been able to get married.

'It was the happiest day of my life and it was amazing to have everyone around me on the special day who have loved and guided me throughout my journey.

'These past three years have been an incredibly difficult journey for me and I continue to be thankful every day.'

Her husband Ben, 33, a property landlord, said: 'It was perfect. We never gave up the hope that it would happen, even though the odds were definitely against us according to the doctors here.

'Laura looked absolutely beautiful. It was a really nice day to draw a line in the sand behind all the bad things that have happened.

'We have started afresh with a real positive memory. It was a very emotional day.

'In some ways what happened to Laura was a gift. It has just made our lives richer. We just appreciate things a lot more.'

Laura started to lose feeling in her right arm in 2010 and an MRI scan revealed she had a rare form of brain cancer called Glioblastoma Multiforme.

She suffered multiple seizures every day and was unable to pick up her baby son as she became partially paralysed.

Her plight attracted huge support after comedian Rufus Hound backed her campaign to fund treatment in the U.S.

He posted a video to his 230,000 Twitter followers calling on people to donate just £2 and within 24 hours, the ‘Hope for Laura; website had raised over £10,000.

Laura and Ben married at Little Hermitage manor house in Strood, Kent, on October 18, surrounded by their family and friends.
