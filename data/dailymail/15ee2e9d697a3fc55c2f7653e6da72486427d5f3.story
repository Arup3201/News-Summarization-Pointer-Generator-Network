A thief jailed for speeding away from a petrol station with the manager clinging onto his bonnet for half a mile has had his driving ban cut in half.

Joshua Charnley, 20, put black tape on his number plates and used his Hyundai car 'like a weapon' as he fled the Texaco garage in West Kingsdown, Kent.

Lekshmanan Asokkumar confronted the thief and tried to stop him leaving but ended up stuck on his bonnet at he sped away.

When Mr Asokkumar didn't get out of the way Charnley drove straight at him, lifting him on to the bonnet of his car, before driving off; Mr Asokkumar was eventually flung off on a corner

Charnley repeatedly swerved across the road and tried to punch Mr Asokkumar's hands to get him off his bonnet, before flinging him to the ground as he rounded a corner.

Mr Asokkumar, 59, suffered a fractured skull and liver damage during the incident last July and is still recovering.

Charnley was jailed for 11 years at Canterbury Crown Court in January and given a 15-year driving ban.

But London's Court of Appeal cut the driving ban in half after Charnley claimed the original sentence was 'too harsh'.

Judge Deborah Taylor, sitting with Lady Justice Rafferty and Justice William Davis, said Charnley had caused Mr Asokkumar 'severe and traumatic brain injuries'.

Joshua Charnley was jailed for 11 years and banned from driving for 15 years, but after an appeal his driving ban has been reduced to eight years

She said his jail term wasn't 'manifestly excessive given the circumstances of the case', but reduced his driving ban to eight years because of his age. 

Mr Asokkumar's wife Judie, 61, said she thought the original sentence had been appropriate and the reduction was 'ridiculous and disgusting'.

She said: 'The whole ordeal has totally destroyed our lives. Lekshmanan is never going to be the same again.

'He only came out of hospital three weeks ago and still needs to have a titanium plate put into his skull at some point to ease some of his pain.

'He has no interest in anything and will never work again. I'm going to be his carer for the rest of his or my life.'

Charnley, of Hartley, Kent, a part-time painter and decorator, claimed he 'panicked' and had not intended to drive at his victim as he fled without paying for £37 worth of petrol.

He admitted causing serious injury by driving dangerously.
