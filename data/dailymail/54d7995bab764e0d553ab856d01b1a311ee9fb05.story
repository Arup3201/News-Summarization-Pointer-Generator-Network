The woman who married and had a child with a notorious Rockefeller imposter has described how she was charmed by the 'intelligent' and 'quirky' con man - and said they acted out characters from Cluedo.

Sandy Boss, 45, who now works in London, gave evidence yesterday in the murder trial of Christian Gerhartsreiter, who told her he was 'Clark Rockefeller', a distant scion of the famous banking dynasty, when they met in New York in 1993.

Ms Boss said of Gerhartsreiter, 52, who is charged with the 1985 murder of John Sohus in California: 'I didn't have reason to think he was not the person he said he was.'

'Heir': Gerhartsreiter, seen in court yesterday, is on trial in California, U.S. for the 1985 murder of John Sohus, who disappeared from his home in San Marino with his wife, Linda

The couple married in 1995 and had a daughter, Reigh, who the defendant was later found guilty of kidnapping in 2009 after the then seven-year-old vanished during an access visit in Boston following the pair's split.

Ms Boss first met the defendant when she was invited to a cocktail party at his New York apartment while she was studying for her MBA at Harvard, the court heard.

The theme was the
game 'Clue', and guests came in costume.

'I was Miss Scarlett and he was Professor Plum,' said Ms Boss, who now lives in London with the couple's 12-year-old daughter.

'I liked him. I thought he was intelligent, very funny, quirky, flattering and complimentary. A good person to get to know.'

They began dating and by 1994 she had graduated, secured a finance job in New York and moved in with him. He told her he was an heir to the Rockefeller fortune but was on the outs with the rest of his relatives and never saw them. He said his parents had been killed in a car crash in 1978.

'I assumed that what he was telling me was true,' she said. 'I didn't have reason to think he was not the person he said he was.'

Ms Boss described how the defendant's charming demeanor dissipated soon after they married in 1995, as he became insistent on secrecy in all of their affairs.

He handled finances but she provided the funds and signed blank cheques for him to use. She said he put charges on her credit cards and had none in his own name. He installed multiple phone lines and had their mail delivered to post office boxes. They moved frequently.

He also had an aversion to certain places. He refused to visit California which he said he hated and would never set foot in Connecticut. Unknown to her, he was under investigation in both places in connection with a missing persons case.

Gerhartsreiter is charged with the 1985 murder of John Sohus, who disappeared from his San Marino, California, home with his wife, Linda. The man's bones were unearthed a decade later. Linda Sohus has never been found.

Ms Boss had no idea her husband was a German immigrant named Christian Gerhartsreiter who had once lived in San Marino and was under investigation in the couple's disappearance.

He told her he was doing Third World debt negotiations.

Their daughter was born in 2001, she said. Ms Boss left her husband in 2007 after realising he was not who he claimed to be.

'I hired private investigators who told me they couldn't tell me who I was married to," she said.

Ms Boss, 45, was composed on the witness stand but never mentioned her ex-husband's name, referring to him as 'the defendant'.

She now lives in London with their 12-year-old daughter.

Defense attorneys deferred cross-examination of Ms Boss until Wednesday.

Earlier, a key witness linked the defendant to a truck bought by the man he is charged with killing in California more than a quarter-century ago.

Christopher Bishop, who became an Episcopal priest, testified that in the 1980s he met a man who called himself Christopher Crowe. Mr Bishop was a film school student and was told by his father, a priest, that there was a new young man in their Greenwich, Connecticut, community who was a filmmaker. He introduced them and they became friends.

Testimony: Christopher Bishop told jurors how he met Gerhartsreiter, who was then calling himself Christopher Crowe, in Connecticut in the 1980s

Mr Bishop said Crowe talked of producing films and one day he offered to give him a truck he said had been used on a production shoot. He suggested Bishop contact California to get license plates. But when he did, he said, he was told there was a lien on the vehicle for $6,000.

'I got a bright idea to buy a cheaper model of the same truck, take the plates off and register it. I was a poor film student then,' the witness said. He said he drove the truck around with fake plates and then abandoned it at a train station. He never saw it again, and it has never been found.

Mr Bishop acknowledged lying about the saga when he was first questioned by police.

'I lied,' he said. 'I said I knew nothing about a truck. I was pretty panicked... This was a person I trusted.'

He added: 'It was not my finest hour.'

Ex-girlfriend: Mihoko Manabe, left, testified in the trial of Christian Gerhartsreiter, right, accused of murder in California in 1985, today. She told how her fiance acted strange when police called him over the deaths

Many identities: Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter listened as his ex-fiance told the court that she knew him as Clark Rockefeller when they met in 1987

Mr Bishop said the
next time he talked to Crowe he told him a detective had been inquiring
about him, and angrily asked: 'Who the (expletive) are you?'

'He said "I gotta go", and that's the last I saw of Chris until this case,' the witness said.

Other
witnesses have said victim John Sohus and his wife, Linda, bought the 
truck just before they vanished in 1985. At the time they lived in a 
suburban San Marino home owned by John Sohus' mother, and defendant 
Gerhartsreiter - using the name Christopher Chichester - occupied a 
guest cottage.

Defense
attorneys claim that victim John Sohus was not killed by their client 
but by his wife, who vanished at the same time he did.

There has been no evidence of a motive for either Gerhartsreiter or Linda Sohus to kill John Sohus.

Earlier in the 
trial Gerhartsreiter's former lover Mihoko Manabe told jurors she never 
knew his true identity until he was charged with murder.

Manabe recalled meeting him in 1987 when they worked at a New York brokerage firm.

Accused: Christian Gerhartsreiter is accused of the 1985 murder of John Sohus

Man of mystery: Manabe never knew he was Gerhartsreiter, a German immigrant charged with the murder of a California man who vanished in 1985

Ms Manabe was working as a tranlator while the defendant was head of the bonds desk. She knew him as Christopher Crowe until he began using the Rockefeller pseudonym.

She didn't know until recently that he was Gerhartsreiter, a German immigrant charged with the murder of a California man who vanished in 1985.

'He was an unusual person,' she said, but after police began calling to interview him, she said he became downright odd.

'After the call, he was markedly different,' she said.

Connection: The bones believed to belong to Mr Sohus were found buried at a home Garhartsreiter was living at while going by the name Chichester

Violent death: The remains believed to be of John Sohus, seen with his then-wife Linda, who is also missing, were found to have died of multiple fractures of the skull inflicted by a blunt object, possibly a baseball bat

He became paranoid
and said they had to go into hiding. She described a cloak-and-dagger 
existence in which he had her dye his hair blonde, grew a beard, 
exchanged his glasses for contact lenses, and made plans to leave the 
country.

He proposed marriage and she accepted, she said, but they neither left the country nor got married.

'The plans all fell by the wayside,' she said.

Her fiance quit 
his job at another major brokerage house and never worked again. She 
said she supported him while he stayed home and took care of bills and 
household chores. She got him a credit card in the name Clark 
Rockefeller.

'Why did you stick
around that long and go along with it?' asked Deputy District Attorney 
Habib Balian. 'He had asked me to marry him and I was loyal,' she said.

'Did you love him?' asked Balian.

'Yes, I did,' said the witness as her former lover sat at a courtroom table taking notes and not looking at her.

'Did you believe he loved you?' asked the prosecutor. 'Yes,' she replied.

Their relationship eventually deteriorated and in 1994 she left to marry another man.

Manabe appeared nervous and said she would have preferred not to testify.

'It's not a part of my life I like to talk about or remember,' she said.
