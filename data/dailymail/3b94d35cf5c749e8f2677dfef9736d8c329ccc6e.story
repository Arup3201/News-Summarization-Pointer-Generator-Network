Tracey Crouch burst into tears after her DJ lover dumped her by text while she was taking part in a vital Commons vote on the Queen's Speech

A Tory MP burst into tears after her DJ lover dumped her by text while she was taking part in a vital Commons vote.

Tracey Crouch discovered in the middle of the Commons vote on the Queen’s Speech last week that her boyfriend, BBC radio’s Steve Ladner, was planning to move out of their Kent home.

Only 24 hours earlier the pair had an emotional reunion after Miss Crouch returned from raising money for injured British soldiers on a charity walk in South America.

The couple were seen kissing, drinking beer and mingling with other MPs on the Commons terrace, and they later spent the night together in London.

But the following day, Mr Ladner texted 38-year-old Miss Crouch to say he was moving out of the home they shared in her Chatham  and Aylesford constituency – and returning to his wife Helen.

His text message is believed to have said: ‘I’m sorry Tracey but I can’t do this. I want to go home. I can’t face speaking to you about it. When you get back I will have packed my bags and left.’

An MP who saw Miss Crouch in the voting lobby after she had received the message said: ‘Tracey was sobbing and she showed me the text message. She was in a state of shock, crying her eyes out. She ran out looking very distressed.’

Miss Crouch told a friend: ‘I am totally devastated. I cannot believe Steve has done this to me.

‘He told me he wanted to marry me and I believed him. I was so excited to get back from South America. He told me he still loved me – then he does this. He is a rat.’

Mr Ladner, 42, works for BBC Radio Kent where he hosts the  ‘Ladner’s Lunchbox’ show. He is also a Dover lifeboatman.

Miss Crouch was on David Cameron’s A-list of women MPs, and is among those tipped for promotion in the forthcoming Cabinet reshuffle.

She is a qualified football coach, runs a girls’ team, plays for the Commons football XI and was a member of a task force set up by ministers to encourage more women to take up sport.

Miss Crouch has also won praise for campaigning against bullying in schools. The couple met two years ago at the radio station’s studios in Chatham. They had their first date at the 50th anniversary of the launch of the submarine HMS Ocelot which is now a tourist attraction in dry dock at the former naval dockyard.

Mr Ladner is a Lib Dem supporter, and in the past Miss Crouch had joked that the couple were ‘proof a coalition can work’.

He moved into Miss Crouch’s  constituency home in February.  Her three-week trip to Ecuador  with fellow MPs and injured servicemen included a charity climb up the 19,347ft-high Cotopaxi volcano which raised nearly £5,000 for  the Royal British Legion and Help For Heroes.

But the MP’s trip was not without its problems. On her very first day in the capital city Quito, Miss Couch was relieved of her purse by a  local thief.

Both Miss Crouch and Mr Ladner have declined to comment.
