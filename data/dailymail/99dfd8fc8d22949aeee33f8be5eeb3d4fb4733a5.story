After 25 years in the baking business, Rachel Brown knew her exquisitely decorated cupcakes were popular. She just didn’t realise how popular.

So when she decided to drum up a little extra trade with a discount deal, she bit off more than she could chew.

Swamped by orders, Mrs Brown, who normally makes 100 cupcakes a month, found herself having to bake an astonishing 102,000.

Recipe for disaster: Rachel Brown had to draft in 25 staff as demand surged for her cupcakes

And disastrously, because her deal 
had been so generous and the demand so huge, she made a loss on every 
order – wiping out her profits for the entire year.

The cupcake catastrophe started when the 50-year-old cook posted a deal on money-saving website Groupon.

She offered subscribers to the site a 75 per cent discount on 12 cakes – selling them for £6.50 instead of the usual £26.

Mrs Brown, from Woodley, near 
Reading, said: ‘We only expected to get a few hundred orders out of it 
but we had thousands and thousands pouring in. We had to cut it off at 
8,500 orders.’

Her company, called Need a Cake, 
normally employs eight workers, but it had to bring in 25 agency staff. 
After spending an extra £12,500 on staff and distribution, she made a 
loss of £2.50 per order.

Sour taste: Cake maker Rachel Brown outside her company Need A Cake, in Woodley near Reading. She was besieged with more than 8,500 requests after placing a discount deal on money-saving website Groupon

Rising to the occasion: Mrs Brown's staff worked night and day to meet the extraordinary demand

‘Without doubt, it’s the worst ever business decision I have made,’ she said. ‘It’s been an absolute nightmare.’

U.S.-based Groupon is a ‘deal-a-day’ 
website offering coupons to subscribers, giving discount deals on 
anything from restaurant meals to spa treatments.

It uses collective buying power to 
achieve lower prices and the deals it offers are available only if a 
minimum number of people sign up. Companies that offer deals hope to 
gain new custom or sell extra goods to customers during their visit.

Mrs Brown’s offer on the website 
invited customers to ‘construct their ideal cupcake, choosing from 
sponge flavour, icing and decoration options’.

And it certainly proved tempting. Mrs
 Brown said: ‘As soon as we were making, packaging and sending the cakes
 out we were on to the next order. It was non-stop. We take pride in 
making cakes of exceptional quality but I had to bring in agency staff 
on top of my usual staff, who had nowhere near the same skills.

‘I was very worried about standards dropping and hated the thought of letting anybody down.

‘Even a much larger company would have difficulty coping, but my poor staff were having to slog away at all hours.

‘One of them even came in at 3am 
because she couldn’t sleep for worry. I’ve been running this business 
for 25 years and I thought I knew what I was doing. We are still working
 to make up the lost money and will not be doing this again.’

Heather Dickinson, Groupon’s 
international communications director, said there was no limit to the 
number of vouchers that could be sold.

Sinking feeling: Need A Cake, which usually employs eight people, had to take on an extra 25 agency staff to meet demand, and in the process wiped out all the profits for the year

Fallout: One of Mrs Brown's employees Jo Walsby was given the unenviable task of fielding calls from angry cupcake buyers whose orders  were taking longer than expected to be fulfilled

Boxed in: Need A Cake usually sells boxes of cupcakes for upwards of £26, meaning a £2.50 loss was made on each of the £6.50 Groupon offers

She said: ‘We approach each business with a tailored, individual approach based on the prior history of similar deals.’

She added there had been ‘constant 
contact’ with Need a Cake and this was the first time she had heard the 
company had experienced difficulties.

But Mrs Brown has refuted this claim, saying she has written records of correspondence highlighting the problem.

Meanwhile, a message on her website informs customers the deal is no longer available.

It reads: ‘The Groupon offer is now 
closed. We regret that we cannot process any unused vouchers as they 
have now expired with Groupon.’

Groupon is a 'deal-a-day' website that offers a series of discount offers on a variety of products and services.

The website, at groupon.co.uk, offers a different daily deal such as a meal out, skills class or beauty treatment in participating cities - 36 in Britain so far. If you are attracted by a deal, you click 'buy now' and give your credit card details.

If enough people have committed, the money is taken and you're emailed back a voucher (or Groupon) which you redeem.

The company boasts that its collective buying power means it can offer discount prices while bringing together businesses and consumers.

HOW TO USE IT

The site is easy to navigate and very clearly laid out. On entering the website you pick your nearest city from a scroll-down menu. The offer is described in minute detail and limitations are highlighted. For example a deal of three microdermabrasion facials for £40, real value £165, is in a salon with 'edgy décor'. Groupon vouchers have to be used within a specified time frame.BEST DEALS

Beauty treatment offers abound. with treatments and spa days frequently on offer. One treatment that has gained nationwide popularity thanks to Groupon is the 'fish pedicure' (where fish nibble at the hard skin on your feet), which is almost permanently on offer for less than £10. Other decent deals include car valet service for £10 instead of £25, cupcake decorating classes for £29 from £99, photography lessons for £30 down from £150. DOWNSIDES

Deals aren't always available nationwide and are limited to particular cities, which may not be near you. Groupon has very few offers from big companies or well-known chains and is top heavy on beauty treatments.
