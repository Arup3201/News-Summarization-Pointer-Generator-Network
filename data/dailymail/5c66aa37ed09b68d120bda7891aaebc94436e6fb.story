An Iowa man faces hate crime charges after allegedly ordering his pit bull to viciously attack a black man while screaming a racial slur at him.

Des Moines resident Joshua Charles Stoll, 21, has been charged with assault in violation of individual rights causing injury as well as probation violation.

Iowa law regards any assault in violation of individual rights as a hate crime.

Joshua Charles Stoll, 21, says he was assaulted by a group of black men after he allegedly sicked his dog on one while screaming racial epithets

Though the bites are severe Pierce should recover without serious lasting injury

The Des Moines Register reports that Stoll was taken into custody after police received a report of a fight at roughly 5:30 p.m. Sunday on he 2200 block of East 41st Street.

Six to eight people were standing at the scene, two of which were identified as brothers.

One of those brothers, 24-year-old Kanin Pierce, had arms that had been savaged by pit bull bites.

According to police, Pierce said a car stopped in his path while he was walking to his own car.

Stoll, who had been driving while intoxicated, and one other man got out of the vehicle and began using racial slurs when asking him what he'd said.

Pierce said he did not know the men or their reason for stopping and called for his brother.

Witness Laroyia Haywood told reporters she heard Stoll yelling racial epithets.

'He was calling him the ‘n-word’ repeatedly and wouldn’t stop. They were 
asking [Stoll] to leave and he wouldn’t leave,' she told KCCI.

Stoll then removed his pit bull terrier from the car and allegedly said 'Sic 'em, Rider.'

The dog then attacked Pierce as Stoll repeated the racial slurs.

The men finally got the dog off of Pierce's arm, which had been severely injured.

Stoll later told police he stopped because a man threw something at his car.

Stoll also claimed that the men with Pierce called in reinforcements who then attacked him.

X-rays later determined Stoll had a fractured rib while a breath test registered a blood alcohol level of 0.128.

Stoll is being held at the Polk County Jail on $6,000 bond and the dog is in quarantine with the Animal Rescue League of Iowa.

Pierce told reporters he did not blame the animal.

'It's not the dog's fault. It's really not the dog's fault,' he said. 'It's [Stoll's] fault. He should have left his dog in the car.'
