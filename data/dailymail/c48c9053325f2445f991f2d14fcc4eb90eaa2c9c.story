Mo Farah can get his season back on track at the ‘much easier’ European Championships in Zurich next week after skipping the Commonwealth Games, according to Paula Radcliffe.

The world marathon record-holder admitted she was surprised Farah, 31, pulled out of both the 5,000 metres and 10,000m in Glasgow and praised athletes such as Olympic 800m champion David Rudisha, who ‘risked’ competing even though not fully fit and had to settle for silver behind Botswana’s Nijel Amos.

Farah, the double Olympic and world champion over 5,000m and 10,000m withdrew after missing a block of training with abdominal pains, but Radcliffe said he would be ‘kicking himself’ after Caleb Mwangangi Ndiku and Moses Kipsiro won gold in his absence.

Fitness: Double Olympic gold medallist Mo Farah missed the Commonwealth Games with abdominal pains

Verdict: BBC pundit Paula Radcliffe believes Farah must target the 'much easier' European Championships

Target: Farah will attempt to run both the 5,000m and 10,000m in Zurich if his body allows it

There is no-one ranked in the world’s top 20 for 5,000m this year competing in Zurich.

Farah’s best is 12min 53.11sec, set in 2011. Fellow Briton Andy Vernon, 28, is the highest-ranked European athlete at No 23, with a best of 13:11.50 this year. It should be more competitive over 10,000m, with Belgium’s Bashir Abdi at No 14 (27:36.40 this year) and Italy’s Daniele Meucci at No 15 (27:36.53). But Farah can run those times in his sleep.

His PB, set in 2011, is 26:46.57.

The BBC pundit, who ranks winning Commonwealth 5,000m gold in Manchester in 2002 as one of her career highlights, said: ‘It’s been a tough season for Mo because he hasn’t been injured, he’s been ill, and that’s when the doubts start to creep in, but hopefully he will be fine for the Europeans.

‘He wasn’t sure he was in shape to come and run in Glasgow, but I was surprised he took the decision to pull straight out of the 10,000m. I thought he might give himself a bit more time.

‘The Commonwealths are important - they were massive for me. In Glasgow I looked at the likes of David Rudisha as someone who’s not quite where he wanted to be in terms of fitness but still risked it and he acquitted himself well.

‘Rudisha, though, didn’t have the back-up of the European Championships next month, which will be much easier races for Mo. They were tougher races in Glasgow with Kipsiro (who won the 10,000m) and Ndiku, the 5,000m winner. But I’d have loved to have seen Mo run and he would have been watching that 10km kicking himself a little bit because Cameron Levins was in contention. Mo trains with him and beats him in training.’

Radcliffe mentors young athletes such as Laura Weightman, 23, who won Commonwealth 1,500m silver, and Jessica Judd, 19, the 800m runner who finished fourth in her first senior championship final. She believes the next generation can use the experience as a springboard for success in Zurich.

Champion: Farah won the 5,000m and 10,000m at the London 2012 Olympics and 2013 World Championships

‘They can use it as a platform, definitely,’ said Radcliffe, 40. ‘That’s what I said to Jess: “You’ve had a huge performance and it’s something to build on”.’

British Athletics performance director Neil Black has not set a medal target for the Europeans, which start on Tuesday, August 12, but the competition will be deemed a failure if Britain do not improve on the seven medals - four gold - they won in Helsinki in 2012 with a weakened team before the start of the London Olympics.

Adam Gemili, who won silver in the 100m in Glasgow, will also run the 200m, while the British team will be boosted by the inclusion of James Dasaolu and Dwain Chambers in the 100m. Dasaolu is the second-quickest British man of all time but was not selected by England for the Commonwealths after opening his season late.

Katarina Johnson-Thompson, 21, is expected to be fit for the long jump. Double world junior champion Morgan Lake, 17, will also contest the high jump, while Matthew Hudson-Smith, 19, who anchored England to Commonwealth gold in the 4x400m relay, is the fastest ranked man in the individual 400m field for his first senior championships.
