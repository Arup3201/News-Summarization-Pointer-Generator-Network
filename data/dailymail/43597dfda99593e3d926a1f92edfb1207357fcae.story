An artist has hit out after her Facebook profile was shut down because it contained pictures of nude models from her life-drawing class.

Joanna Susskind, 29, organised male and female models to come and pose naked at the art lessons she gives in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dundee.

But when connecting with her students on Facebook, she was shocked to see website bosses clamp down on the group's photos using its strict 'pornography' rules.

Artist Joanna Susskind had her Facebook profile shut down and picture's removed from her art class's group because nude models pictures in photo breached the website's 'pornography' rules

It is believed the page was reported to Facebook technical staff, who closed down Ms Susskind's personal profile and removed several photos from the art group's forum.

The Glasgow-based artist said: 'There is nothing remotely pornographic about the pictures.

'It's pretty ironic really because life-drawing is one of the oldest art forms. There are some pictures with nude models in them but it's not full frontal and it's not offensive.'

Ms Susskind set up the classes, called All The Young Nudes, six years ago and their success has led her to take them around Scotland.

Up to 100 artists attend the two-hour weekly Glasgow class in a private room at a city centre pub.

Ms Susskind now has plans to licence an evening class in New York, a city she was visiting when she was told her page had been removed earlier this month.

The art classes are popular with students, who draw nudes in a private room of a pub in the centre of Glasgow

But Facebook say images posted on the group's page breach their strict rules on 'nudity and pornography'

She added: 'They removed a few pictures but the page is back up again. I guess it's going to be an ongoing thing because life-drawing is all about the nude human form.'

A Facebook spokesman said Joanna's profile was 'temporarily blocked' for breaching their terms and confirmed that some links were removed for breaking their rules on nudity.

The spokesman said: 'Facebook has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content. We also impose limitations on the display of nudity.

'But we aspire to respect people's right to share content of personal importance, whether those are photos of a sculpture like Michelangelo's David or family photos of a child breastfeeding.'

Ms Susskind insisted there was 'nothing remotely pornographic' about the images posted on the group's page

'Graphic or violent content': Former soldier Andy Reid, 37, who lost both legs and an arm while serving in Afghanistan has called Facebook 'harsh and narrow-minded' after they removed a picture of one of his stumps because it was 'offensive'.

The former Corporal from St Helens, Merseyside, posted the picture of his stump with the caption 'hard work on the legs today'. But it was taken down by the social media's site communities team after a user complained about it.

Until October last year, beheading videos were removed by Facebook but the site changed its policy allowing them to stay online, as long as they were not glorifying the violence and used to raise awareness or condemn the action being shown. Breaking these guidelines can lead to a lifetime ban.

'Nudity': In July, professional photographer Jill White was suspended from Facebook after she posted a photograph of her daughter Willa, two, on the beach - which the site labelled 'pornographic'.

Mrs White, from North Carolina, said that she fell foul of Facebook's notoriously strict guidelines on posting nude pictures of children after they received a complaint about her innocent recreation of the famous 'Coppertone girl' pose from the 1950s ad campaign

Facebook has a strict policy against sharing pornography, and any explicit sexual content including a child. Users who have posted pictures of their children naked or semi-clothed have been banned from the site.

Facebook says it does 'aspire to respect people’s right to share content of personal importance', including pictures of breast feeding, and lifted a blanket ban on such images in June following the high profile 'Free The Nipple' campaign.

'Users with false names': In the run up to the 2011 Royal Wedding, Facebook pages set up by anti-austerity protesters, including UK Uncut, were disabled. However, Facebook said the profiles were suspended not for political reasons, but because they had not been correctly registered.

The Facebook community standards state that 'claiming to be another person, creating a false presence for an organisation, or creating multiple accounts undermines community and violates Facebook's terms.'
