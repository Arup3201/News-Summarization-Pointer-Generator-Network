Caterham have announced that they will take part at the final Formula One race of the season in Abu Dhabi.

The British team, who entered into administration in October, launched a ‘crowdfunding’ scheme last week in a bid to raise more than £2million to make the race.

And despite still coming up £500,000 short of their target on Friday afternoon, the administrators acting on behalf of Caterham, have announced that they will race next weekend. 

The cash-strapped team claim they will now compete at the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi

Finbarr O'Connell of Smith & Williamson, joint administrator from the London-based accountancy firm said: 'We set ourselves a major challenge, but it’s definitely been worth it.

'In only a week the fans have made the impossible, possible. 

'We knew that the best way to keep this team alive and attract possible buyers was to show that it’s still a racing team and be in Abu Dhabi for the finale, and there aren’t enough words to say how grateful we are to all the fans that have made this possible.

'We now head to Abu Dhabi ready to show what a hard-working and positive group of people this is and to hopefully secure a future for the team.

Caterham said they needed to raise £2.35million to make the season finale in Abu Dhabi next week 

'During the past few days the interest of many potential buyers has increased massively and by racing in Abu Dhabi the team will be showcasing itself as a live and functioning team that deserves to continue into 2015 and beyond. 

'It has hard-working people, team spirit and experience and now it only needs a secure financial future which I’m very hopeful we can achieve. 

'I’d like to reiterate that we are racing in Abu Dhabi thanks to all the fans out there – an achievement that will go down in F1 history and one that we can all be very proud of. 

'We still need to raise a bit more cash so please do keep an eye on the Crowdcube website.' 

Part of the  campaign has seen team kit, race suits from former drivers and old car parts sold off to bring in donations, with new items added over the past few days.

One high-price ticket item includes dinner with one of the drivers at the Royal Automobile Club in London, although it remains to be seen who will be behind the wheel.

Marcus Ericsson severed ties with the team earlier this week. British drivers Alice Powell and Jolyon Palmer meanwhile, are both in contention for a seat.
