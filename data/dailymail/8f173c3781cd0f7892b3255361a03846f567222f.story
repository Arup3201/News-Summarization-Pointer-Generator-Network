A black bear that was
killed near the scene of a deadly mauling in remote Alaska last week 
has been identified as the animal responsible, Alaska State Troopers 
said Tuesday.

Robert Weaver, 64, was mauled Thursday outside a cabin at George Lake, about 110 miles southeast of Fairbanks.

"Mr. Weaver's remains were found in the bear's stomach," troopers spokeswoman Beth Ipsen said.

Oh, my: Authorities found the victim's remains in the stomach of a Black Bear

But
even that wasn't enough to prompt final determination since this bear 
could have been near the cabin and ate the remains after another bear 
left.

However, Ipsen said wildlife troopers 
made the determination that this was the bear responsible after no other
bears were seen in the vicinity of the kill.

Weaver,
of Fairbanks, and his wife were at the lake last Thursday when the 
attack happened. His wife, who hasn't been identified, sought shelter in
the cabin and called authorities.

Responding 
officials, including personnel from Eielson Air Force Base in Fairbanks 
and Alaska Wildlife Troopers via boat, found Weaver's body outside the 
cabin and his wife severely traumatized inside.

An Alaska Wildlife Trooper investigating the death with a civilian noticed a black bear stalking the area and killed it.

A
necropsy was conducted on the bear the following day in Fairbanks, and 
Alaska Department of Fish and Game biologist Cathie Harms said the bear 
appeared to be an older adult male based upon the wear on its molars.

She
said it had normal levels of fat, meaning it was not in a condition of 
starvation, and did not have any apparent disease or infirmity.

"We don't have any kind of determination of what led up to the attack," Ipsen said.

It didn't appear the bear was protecting a food cache, and since it was male, it wasn't being protective of cubs, she said.

Not common: there have only been four fatal Black Bear attacks in Alaska in the last 61 years

There appear to be no mitigating factors for the mauling, she added.

Attacks
by black bears are very uncommon, with fatal attacks even more rare. 
Harms said records only indicate four other fatalities by black bears in
Alaska in the last 61 years.

Ipsen said the wife's name is not being released to give her privacy.

"We want to give her time, give her space," Ipsen said. "She's going through a lot."
