Eight-year-old Sam Martin is expected to pass away any day now and the beautiful boy's tragic story has touched the hearts of thousands of people from all over the globe.

A heart-wrenching video showing the declining journey from a glowing, energetic and healthy young boy to a very frail, listless, sick child has pulled at the heart strings of complete strangers who are expressing their warm wishes on a Facebook page dedicated to the lovable boy from the Sunshine Coast in Queensland.

In July last year, Sam was diagnosed with stage three adult-type fibrosarcoma but after 13 rounds of chemotherapy and seven weeks of radiation therapy, treatments had little effect on the tumour growing in his left cheek.

Sam Martin's tragic story has touched the hearts of thousands of people from across the globe

Doctors sent Sam home to be with his family as they were unable to operate on the tumour which is now moving into the brain.

His parents Mark and Tanya Martin and big sister Ella, 10, have been overwhelmed by the support shown from strangers from all over the world including the Netherlands, Malaysia, Canada, London and Denmark.

Mr Martin said it was hard to find the words to describe the love shown for his son.

'Ever since Sam was born he has had a certain 'like ability' to him, one of those truly magnetic personalities,' he told the Sunshine Coast Daily.

'It is heartening to see even through all this he has maintained that quality, as is evident by the outpouring of love from everyone.' 

Melinda Casaubon, with her two children, is holding a walk up Mount Coolum this Sunday in Sam's honour

One of more than 2,000 people who have joined the Sam's Journey Facebook page, is Melinda Casaubon who although she doesn't know Sam or his family, held a group walk up Mount Coolum in his honour on Sunday and is holding another this Sunday.

'I have a son the same age so I just can't imagine what they are going through,' Ms Casaubon told Daily Mail Australia. 

'I thought it would be nice to get outdoors and do something local where we can enlighten Sam and his family's day and also think about the things we take for granted.'

The 52 lives website also has page dedicated to Sam asking people to light a candle and post the photo on his Facebook page or email it through the site. 

Sam is now almost uncommunicative now and very fatigued from the medication to keep his pain at bay.

'It's really sad to see. It rips me apart because there is no interaction because he is on that many drugs to manage his pain,' Mr Martin said.

Mr Martin updated the well wishers on his son's Facebook page earlier today.

'Sam had a good sleep interrupted only a couple of times with a visit from "Ralph". 

'His pain is under control which is a blessing, bit of a rattle as he breathes which is caused by the tumor placing pressure on his windpipe.'

'He's doing good though, we've got a great room in the ward where the morning sun comes in so he's in a nice place right now.'
