Locked up: Robert W. Thomas, 37, pleaded guilty to trying to buy a child earlier this year

A car mechanic has been sentenced to 30 years in prison for trying to buy a 10-year-old girl for $400 so he could keep her as a sex slave.

Robert W. Thomas, 37, pleaded guilty earlier this year to charges of offering to buy a child, enticement and receipt and distribution of visual depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct, and he was sentenced in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio on Monday.

Thomas, who is not married, was arrested in Alliance on January 11 after he posted an advert on a social media website seeking a girl between the ages of five and eight for an 'arranged' marriage.

In the advert, he wrote that he hoped to find 'a breeding slave' and 'a young wife that I can train to be a slut,' court records show, the Canton Rep reported.

After seeing the ad, an Alliance Police Department officer who was assigned to the Ohio Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force responded and pretended to be a parent willing to sell their 10-year-old child for $400, the Akron Beacon Journal reported.

Alliance Police Lieutenant John Jenkins said at the time that Thomas wanted to buy the child to use as a sex slave and to 'train her to please him'.

Thomas drove to meet the parent at a restaurant and once he discussed the transaction with the undercover officer, he was arrested. He had $400 in his hand at the time, police said.

Authorities then carried out a search of his home and unearthed a stash of child pornography - 44 videos and 290 images - and a vast collection of sexual devices, including bondage ropes, according to court documents.

They also found seven firearms, including an AR-15 rifle with a grenade launcher - although they did not recover any grenades. He legally owned the weapons, authorities said.

A search of his computer also revealed that he was active on several websites where similar posts were made.

Jenkins added that they believed Thomas was committed to finding a child to use as a sex slave and, that if agents had not intervened, they believe he could have succeeded. 

'We believe he was very serious about wanting this to happen,' Jenkins told the Beacon Journal.

Thomas, who lived alone with his three dogs, had no prior felony arrests or sex offenses.

'This sentence is well-deserved given the disturbing nature of the charges,' attorney Steve Dettelbach told WKYC. 'Our office remains committed to working with the FBI and all our law enforcement partners to defend our children and fight human trafficking.'
