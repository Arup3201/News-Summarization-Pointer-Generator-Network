A Scots pensioner who has had both feet amputated has been refused a blue disabled parking badge – because he is able to walk 'more than 20 yards'.

Tom Hannah, 73, had the lower part of both legs removed in operations last year after doctors discovered that his irregular heartbeat was causing circulation problems in his legs.

He was granted a provisional blue badge to let him park in disabled spaces but when he tried recently to renew it, he was told that because he could walk 20 yards he was not eligible.

Turned down: Tom Hannah, 73, was told by Fife Council he was not eligible for a disabled blue badge - despite the fact both his legs have been amputated 

Mr Hannah, a retired Ministry of Defence employee from Rosyth, Fife, said yesterday: 'Walking is a real struggle.

'I applied for a blue badge last year and they gave me one for a year. When I spoke to them, they said, "This is a provisional one" and I said to them, "What do you expect – the leg to grow back?"

'I was told I could walk more than 20 yards. They said it more than once.

'It's a struggle. My friend from across the road comes and takes me because when I go out, I take a wheelchair because I don't trust myself not to fall.

'I'm really annoyed and really upset. I was so angry when I was told that I would not be eligible for one because I can walk a short distance with my crutches.

'I couldn't get from my front door to my car.'

Mr Hannah was told that the ability to walk 20 yards was part of the assessment for blue badge eligibility.

He said: 'Am I disabled or am I not? I've lost both my legs and if I'm not, what else do I need amputated?

'Because of my age I don't get any help from the Government – no disability allowance and I even have to pay for my own road tax because I don't qualify.

'The only concession I have is a blue badge and they're threatening to take it away from me. I'll not be able to go up the street.

Upset: The retired Ministry of Defence Employee has 'put himself through hell' to walk and asks 'what else do I need to get amputated' in order to qualify as disabled 

'I put myself through hell to try to walk. I'm ok in the house but when I go out you have no idea.

'You think you're walking on a level surface but when you get a prosthetic leg you have to keep an eye on the road all the time. Your foot will catch and it will trip you over.'

Mr Hannah started having problems when he went on a cruise holiday in Norway and felt what he thought was cramp down his right leg.

After returning, he visited hospital but even after numerous tests doctors were unable to identify the cause of his problems.

Then one day while going upstairs in his home he collapsed with a severe pain down his side.

After more tests at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee medics found he had an irregular heartbeat which was causing circulation problems.

Mr Hannah said: 'They took my left leg off – it was really painful.'

He was later told his right lower leg would also have to be amputated and another prosthetic limb fitted.

He said: 'A blue badge is for the disabled. Surely that classes me as disabled?'

Fife Council has now told him he will have to go for a mobility assessment with an occupational therapist in an attempt to resolve the situation.

Initial applucation: Mr Hannah was granted a provisional blue badge to let him park in disabled spaces but when he tried recently to renew it, he was told that because he could walk 20 yards he was not eligible

Anne Cowan, Fife Council's lead professional for accessible transport and concessions, said all councils had to follow a code of practice issued by Transport Scotland when evaluating blue badge applications.

She added: 'This is national practice, not council policy, and the rules laid out in this guidance are very specific.

'Common sense would suggest that he is eligible for a blue badge but the way his mobility was described in his application did not meet the national scheme criteria.

'We explained this to Mr Hannah over the phone and are continuing to discuss the situation with him.'
