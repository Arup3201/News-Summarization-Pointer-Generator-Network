Two bereft newlyweds who lost their spouses months after saying 'I do', have told how a chance introduction led them to find love and hope again with each other.

In a moving YouTube video Jessica Moreland and Jordan Rice explain that they were both widowed in their twenties. Jessica's husband was killed in a motorcycle accident while cancer took Jordan's wife.

At first the pair - who did not know each other and lived in different cities - thought finding another life partner would be impossible, but thanks to mutual friends they randomly came to connect and just last month tied the knot in Baltimore.

Recounting her tale Jessica, now 30, explains that she married her first husband and 'soul mate' Jarronn on May 15, 2009.

However, just two-and-a-half months after their big day he was out riding on his motorcycle and involved in a road accident. Severe injuries and major blood loss led to his eventual death on July 30.

Recalling her emotions, she said: 'Life after losing a spouse is really difficult as you can imagine.

'You know, all of your hopes and dreams are kind of wrapped up in that person.

'You set forth and you're ready to take on life and you assume that that person’s going to be a part of the story.'

Meanwhile Jordan, 31, a lawyer turned New York City pastor, says that he got married on August 22, 2009.

But ten months later his 27-year-old wife Danielle started feeling ill. Doctors diagnosed her with Stage 4 primary cardiac sarcoma, a rare cancer that develops in or on the heart.

Her condition rapidly deteriorated and she lost her battle with the disease on April 23, 2011.

Shortly after his wife's funeral a friend of Jordan's came to visit him in New York and dropped the name 'Jessica Moreland' into conversation.

They mentioned that she had also lost her partner at a young age and had blogged about her experience.

Intrigued, Jordan decided to look her up online.

'When I found her . . . I did 
what everybody does and sent her a friend request on Facebook,' he said.

'She 
accepted it a day or two later. I sat at my computer and it took me 
about half-an-hour to write this carefully crafted message that sounded 
cool, not stalkerish or creepy.'

After exchanging messages online Jordan and Jessica 
discovered that they had dozens of mutual friends and lots of shared interests including cooking, 
travel, photography and Spanish.

A couple of weeks after Friending Jessica on Facebook, Jordan decided to visit her in Washington DC where she worked as a marketing specialist.

'We could both be vulnerable early on, in a way that only people who have gone through what we've gone
through could understand'

'He admitted that he was relatively an internet stranger but there were people that we knew mutually that could vouch for him,' she said.

Immediately when they met, they hit it off. On their first 'date' they ended up sitting and talking for five hours, sharing stories about their previous relationships and heartache.

'One of the things that helped with Jordan and I being able to click so quickly was the fact that we could both be very vulnerable so early on, in a way that only people who have gone through what we’ve gone through could understand,' Jessica said.

Half way through one of their conversations Jordan said that he stopped and turned to Jessica and told her she was 'incredible'.

Within weeks, they introduced the 
other to their families and said that they instantly knew they would be married.

In a bid to make sure they were 'thinking clearly' and not letting grief cloud their perspective, they booked in for a session of premarital counseling.

The
therapist ordered an assessment test which included questions on topics 
from conflict resolution to financial management. Thankfully the results confirmed the couple's deep connection.

They told ABC News that the therapist said: 'Either you guys are the kind of people who anticipate the 
other person's answer or you are the most compatible couple I have ever 
seen.'

The loved-up couple, who can't even remember how or when they got engaged, married on June 22, in a simple 
ceremony in Baltimore.

At their nuptials they played their five-minute long video, created with help from the Meraki Collective, detailing their moving story.

The entire congregation, which included the families of 
their late spouses, were apparently moved to tears as the film played.

Jessica added: 'I imagined that I would find someone to 
marry and move on with but . . . I didn’t really think it was possible to meet someone like [Jordan].'
