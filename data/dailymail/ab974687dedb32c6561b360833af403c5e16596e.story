An American man who loved Romania so much he wrote books about it has been deported from Romania.

Sam Reames left his native Orlando, Florida, for Romania's second largest city of Cluj a decade ago and became an unofficial ambassador, appearing on TV and running a website called kingofromania.com.

But in April Romania's Immigration Office began proceedings to remove him after saying his stay had not been legal for six and a half years.

He lost a court appeal, making national headlines as offcers drove him to the border with Hungary and told him not to come back until 2017.

Deported: Sam Reames (left with his girlfriend Rodica Cangea and right) moved to Romania 10 years ago from Florida and loved it so much he talked about it on TV. Now he has been told to leave and barred from returning

Cross: The 41-year-old said: 'I couldn't believe it when they turned up at my door and told me I was being deported. At first I thought they were Jehovah's Witnesses due to the way they were standing with paperwork'

The 41-year-old insisted he had simply fallen foul of red tape, forgetting to renew his visa, and wanted nothing more than to stay with his Romanian girlfriend and his possessions.

He was known in local media as 'Sam Cel Roman' (Sam the Romanian) because of his passion for the country, appearing on national television and joking: 'I'm more Romanian than you are'. 

His wrote tourist guides and blogs about his adopted home for several years, including a 'Complete Insider's Guide to Romania' in 2011.

But the Romanian immigration service said that by forgetting to extend his stay, which would probably have been automatically approved, he qualified for a ban.

Joke: The American citizen posted memes like this one about his adopted home on his Facebook page

That meant armed officers dragged him from his home for violating immigration law. He complained he was not given time to arrange for anybody to care for his pet cats.

'I couldn't believe it when they turned up at my door and told me I was being deported,' he said.

'At first I thought the two people at the door were Jehovah's Witnesses due to the way they were standing in front of my door with paperwork in their hand.

'But when they identified themselves as immigration officers and said they were there for me, I thought it was a joke. It was only when they started to cart me off that I realised they were serious.

'I was told it was a minor matter but as soon as they got me in the car and took me to the police station, I was banged up in a tiny cell where I was surrounded by immigration officers including one guy that was shouting at me and demanding to know why was breaking the law.

'To be honest they treated me like a child molester, not just somebody who'd forgot to extend his visa. I was kept there for five hours and they wouldn't even let me go to the bathroom.'

Mr Reames complained that during his appeal - which he lost at the end of June - he was given a translator who did not speak English.

His pleas that he intended to marry his Romanian girlfriend Rodica Cangea also went unheeded, he said.

Explaining the alleged mix-up, he said: 'I came into the country on a tourism visa and then became part of a local company that gave me a permanent visa, but my trouble started when that got stolen.

'I guess what happened after that was lost in translation and now I suddenly find myself evicted.'

The self-appointed Romania expert is now staying with friends in southern Germany. 

Marius Ludusan, the chief commissioner of Cluj's immigration service, said: 'He legally entered the country six to seven years ago and forgot to leave.

'In order to stay in the country for so long, he should have contacted any local office and requested the extension of his stay.

'Anyone that comes here needs to obey the law. Those that don't obey the law have to face the consequences.' 

As both nations are part of the European Union, Britons are free to live and work in Romania and vice versa after restrictions were lifted on January 1.

But Americans, Australians, Canadians and New Zealanders must apply for a visa if they are staying for longer than 90 days.
