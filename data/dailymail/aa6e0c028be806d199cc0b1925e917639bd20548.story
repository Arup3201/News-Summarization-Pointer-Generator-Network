Lanzarote, Tenerife and Cancun in Mexico are offering British holidaymakers some of the best bargains for a post-holiday break thanks to a stronger pound, research has revealed.

The pound is making top winter sun destinations more affordable for UK tourists with those visiting resorts such as Tenerife, Lanzarote and Paphos in Cyprus now getting five per cent more for their money than a year ago.

Some of the best savings are found in long-haul destinations, where the local currency has dipped even more against the sterling.

For a seven-night package holiday, Lanzarote offers the best-value for money, according to a study

Holidaymakers who are heading to destinations in the US will get 4.3 per cent less for their money

Britons jetting off to sunny Cancun will get 8.2 per cent more for their money than last year, while visitors to Tokyo will see their money stretch 9.1 per cent further.

For a seven-night package holiday, including evening meals, Lanzarote offers the best-value for money with such a package costing just £278 per person.

The next-best resort is Paphos (£283), followed by Tenerife (£309) and Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt where the package costs £408 despite a 1.2 per cent dip in the pound's value in Egypt since last year.

Holidaymakers who are heading to the US will get 4.3 per cent less for their money, as the pound has dipped against the US dollar in the last year.

Caribbean destinations are more affordable than a year ago, while the pound is 4.8 per cent stronger against the South African rand.

Andrew Brown of Post Office Travel Money said: ‘Although European winter sun holidays are unbeatable on price, the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh is also great value with packages pegged at 2013 levels to make them a compelling proposition for bargain hunters.

‘Further afield, the continuing strength of sterling against currencies for some of the most popular long haul beach destinations will make these attractive to wallet watchers as well -particularly in Mexico and Jamaica where the pound has risen in value recently.’
