Ever wondered what the Queen looks like when she’s had a win on the horses? Well you know now.

With a dazzling smile of utter delight, she couldn’t contain her excitement yesterday as one of her horses, Sign Manual, raced to victory – scooping her prize money of £5,175.

If she’d had a flutter on him too she will have taken home even more, as the horse had odds of 4-1 to win at Newbury.

I can't believe it! The joyful realisation of victory sets in for Queen Elizabeth II

Keen royal watchers will be heartened by the Queen’s evident good cheer, following her admission to hospital suffering from gastroenteritis little more than a month ago.

The Queen, who is 87 tomorrow, is evidently showing similarly strong form to her winning horse, and seemed happy to relax  following her sombre public appearance at Baroness Thatcher’s funeral on Wednesday.

Sign Manual, a gelding, was ridden to victory by Hayley Turner in the Dreweatts 1759 Handicap, coming from behind to  finish just ahead of the 7-2 favourite, Lieutenant Miller.

Huzzah! The Queen celebrates with Sign Manual's racing manager John Warren, centre, and the horse's trainer Michael Bell her trainer, right

'It was very much the plan as soon as 
the programme book came out, as we knew Her Majesty would be coming to 
the meeting,' said Sign Manual's trainer Michael Bell.

'It's very much a private visit for her, but (racing manager) John Warren gives us the heads-up.

'His form, particularly his last run at Newbury, had worked out well and we had him tuned-up, so it's great.

'We're very happy as The Queen very rarely goes racing with all her other commitments.'
