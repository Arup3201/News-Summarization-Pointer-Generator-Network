Happy and carefree, this image of Karen Perry with her three children is likely to haunt her forever.

She now faces every mother's worst nightmare as she struggles to come to terms with losing all her offspring in a plane crash on the eve of Thanksgiving at Superstition Mountains, Arizona.

Morgan Perry, nine, and her brothers 
Logan, eight, and six-year-old Luke all perished in the crash, along with 
their father Shawn Perry, 39, and two other adults dead.

Loss: Shawn Perry, the father who piloted the small plane, and daughter Morgan, who suffered from epilepsy

They had gone with their father, who is divorced from Mrs Perry, so that they could spend Thanksgiving with him.

'It's traumatic for any parent to hear 
this, and then just the nature of the crash is horrific,' Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu told 
ABCNews.com.

'We just want to be there for her and love her and embrace 
her during this difficult time at Thanksgiving.'

All six victims of the crash have now been found, but their remains have yet to be removed from the mountain.

The other pilot was identified as 
Russell Hardy, 31, of Thatcher, Arizona who was married with children.

Loss: Mechanic Joseph Hardwick, 22, also died in the crash. He was due to marry next month

Hardwick, 22, of Safford. Hardwick also perished. He was due to get married next month.

'No one could have survived that crash,' Babeu said.

'All of these families are obviously heartbroken and traumatized over the loss of their loved ones - and on Thanksgiving.'

The impact split the private plane, 
causing a massive fireball captured on video and seen for miles around, 
and left officials with little hope of finding survivors.

Witnesses saw a fireball and an explosion.

'I looked up and saw this fireball and it rose up,' Dave Dibble told KPHO-TV. 'All of a sudden, boom.'

Rescue
crews flown in by helicopter to reach the crash site reported finding 
two debris fields on fire, suggesting that the plane broke apart on 
impact.

'The fuselage is stuck down into some 
of the crevices of this rough terrain,' Babeu said.

Crash site: Pieces of charred plane were found strewn across the mountain. There were no survivors

Search: Efforts continue to recover bodies from the site, as well as clues as to how the crash occurred

'This
is not a flat area, this is jagged peaks, almost like a cliff-type 
rugged terrain.'

Mr Perry had collected his three children from Canyon, 
Arizona, where they lived with their mother , to take them to Safford for
Thanksgiving.

He was about 100 miles east of Phoenix when he ran into 
trouble.

The tiny 
two-engine plane burst into flames after colliding with the Flat Iron section of the mountains, which are 45 miles east of Phoenix, just below their peak, witnesses reported. 

Tragedy: The crash sparked a fireball in Arizona's Superstition Mountains on the tragic Thanksgiving accident

Investigation: A 40-person rescue team began searching the area for survivors at dawn yesterday

Horror crash: Witnesses said they heard a plane trying to rev its engines before hitting the mountains

Babeu said he was in close contact with the mother of the children.

'We have been aggressively searching and recovering,' Babeu said.

'It's
almost like an 80 percent incline so because of that, you can imagine 
where debris tumbled to.'

'This is some of the toughest country you can experience,' Johnson said. 'That plane is all over the place up there.'

After the crash, a 12-person rescue team began hiking 
to the site, but the combination of the terrain and the 
darkness meant it took six hours until workers were able 
to reach the crash site.

At first light yesterday morning, a 40-person recovery team began searching the mountainous terrain for bodies.

The
plane involved in the crash, the Rockwell Aero Commander 690, is almost 
identical to the aircraft in which Senator Ted Kennedy cheated death on 
June 19, 1964.

Kennedy (pictured right following the crash) 
was a passenger in an AC 680 which dropped into an apple orchard in Southampton, Massachusetts - killing the pilot Edwin 
Zimny and his aide Edward Moss.

The twin engine light aircraft (similar to the one pictured below) plunged, in bad weather, on the final approach to the Barnes Municipal Airport in Westfield.

Kennedy,
who was 32 and in the middle of campaigning for re-election to the 
Senate, escaped with a punctured lung, broken ribs, shattered vertebrae 
and internal bleeding.

The
accident came just seven months after Kennedy's brother John had been 
assassinated in Dallas.

Kennedy later told Civil Aeronautics Board investigators: 'I was watching the altimeter and I saw it drop from 1,100ft to 600ft.

'It
was just like a toboggan ride, right along the tops of the trees for a 
few seconds. Then there was a terrific impact into a tree.'

The
plane crashed in an orchard three miles short of the runway.

Kennedy
spent five months in a Boston hospital, where his staffers set up an 
office room from where he could work on his re-election.

The
recovery team, which Babeu said comprises 'some of the best-trained 
pros in the country', worked to find the five remaining bodies and 
evidence before 4 p.m yesterday.

'There's a window because of some storm concerns,' he told ABC.com. 'Some of the evidence and wreckage is strewn for some distance.'

On Wednesday night, helicopter rescue teams reported seeing two debris field on fire, suggesting the plane broke apart on impact with the jagged rocks.

'The fuselage is stuck down into some of the crevices of this rough 
terrain, and we're doing our best at this point in the darkness,' Babeau
said. 'This is not a flat area. This is jagged peaks, almost like a 
cliff-type rugged terrain.'

The private aircraft was a twin-engine Rockwell AC690, authorities said.

Its registered owner is Ponderosa Aviation Inc. of Safford, Arizona, according to FAA records. 

A video uploaded to YouTube from a 
greyscale webcam shows a small white light moving from the left side of 
the screen to the right.

About 50 seconds into the footage the light 
disappears.

A few seconds later there is a sudden flash of light, then more light remains as the fires burn on the mountain.

A local resident took the video from his home in Gold Canyon, roughly seven miles away from the crash site, ABC News reported.

Graham
said 911 calls began coming in around 6.30 pm on Friday after an 
explosion near the Flat Iron area close to Lost Dutchman State Park.

'People said it sounded like fireworks going off,' Graham said.

One witness told CNN that a mushroom cloud of flames lit up the evening sky.

Another local observer Ronnie Brant told KPHO TV the plane seemed to be having engine trouble.

Some witnesses said they heard a plane trying to rev its engines to climb higher before apparently hitting the mountains.

The Superstition Mountains' elevation is about 5,000 feet at their highest level.

The photogenic area near Lost 
Dutchman State Park and the Superstition Wilderness is filled with steep
canyons.

Its soaring rocky outcroppings are popular with hikers and 
horse riders.

Apache myth holds that the mountains contain a hole that is an entrance to the underworld.

Treasure hunters who frequent the area have been looking for the legendary Lost Dutchman mine for more than a century.
