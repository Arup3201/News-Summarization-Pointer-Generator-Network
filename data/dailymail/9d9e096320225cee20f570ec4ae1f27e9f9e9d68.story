A teacher has been jailed for hitting a young boy when he made mistakes during reading lessons at a mosque.

Arfaq Hussain, 36, from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, used his knuckles to rap the seven-year-old around the knee in what the judge described as 'unforgiveable conduct'.

The offence came to light in December 2012 when another pupil told a teacher that he did not want to do PE classes at the Jame Masjid Mosque in Batley, West Yorkshire, because his legs were sore.

Arfaq Hussain, 36, who was a teacher at the Jame Masjid Mosque in 
Batley, West Yorkshire, has been jailed for 26 weeks after admitting 
cruelty against a seven-year-old, who he hit over the knee with his 
knuckles

Leeds Crown Court heard how social services spoke to both boys about the allegations. A medical examination then found six blue-coloured bruises to the side of the seven-year-old's knee.

The court heard that, when the boy was questioned, he said his teacher would hit him 
if he made mistakes.

He said he would be told: 'You’re not reading what you are supposed to be reading.'

Hussain, who has been suspended from teaching, admitted cruelty and was jailed for 26 weeks.

He admitted he kept an eye on the children and reported them to the main teacher if they were naughty. 

Rebecca Young, defending, said it was a 'momentary lapse of control by an otherwise caring father and teacher'.

She said he had not intended to cause any injured and was 'mortified' by the shame he had brought on his family and mosque.

Miss Young added that a jail sentence would be difficult for his family, for whom he was the sole provider.

Judge Tom Bayliss QC accepted it was a one-off offence but said his parents had trusted their son would not be harmed at the mosque.

He said: 'They were entitled and the public is entitled to know that those who care for our children in whatever capacity, voluntary or paid, will not abuse them, will not injure them.

'You did injure him. It may have been only once but it was unforgiveable conduct towards a young and vulnerable child.'
