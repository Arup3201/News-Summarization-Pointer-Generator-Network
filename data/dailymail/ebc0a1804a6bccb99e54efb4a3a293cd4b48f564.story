Locked up: Apollo Hernandez, 29, had his bail revoked at the request of his father on Monday

A fearful father has asked police to revoke his son's bail for an incest rape charge after the man's mother was found murdered inside her apartment.

Apollo Hernandez, 29, was charged earlier this year with sexually assaulting a teenage relative in 2008 but he was released after his father posted $3,500 bail.

On Saturday morning, Hernandez's mother, 48-year-old Ruth Maceira, who was a witness in his case, was found with her neck slashed in her Bushwick apartment.

On Monday, Hernandez's father, Alfred Hernandez, went to Brooklyn Criminal Court and asked for his son's bail money back and for authorities to lock up his son, the New York Daily News reported.

Although sources told the Daily News that Hernandez had been named as a suspect in his mother's murder, he had not yet been charged because investigators were waiting for crime scene evidence.

But his father told authorities that he was fearful that his son 'can be a danger to himself or others', prosecutors said.

Authorities reacted to the father's plea by using an open warrant they had for Hernandez for littering to take him back to court and hand back the bail money to his father.

A source said his father saw no other option because he wanted to get help for his son. 

Hernandez's mother was found face-down on the floor and unresponsive in her fourth-floor apartment on Grove Street with a deep cut to her neck, authorities previously said.

Emergency responders rushed to the scene but were unable to save her. 

Authorities said that there did not seem to be any signs of a forced entry at the home, but there were indications of a struggle.

Afterwards, Hernandez was taken into police custody but refused to answer any questions, a source told the Daily News. 

The newspaper added that Maceira was a witness in her son's case after his alleged victim told her about the rape earlier this year.

Hernandez will be back in court for a hearing on the rape case in January.
