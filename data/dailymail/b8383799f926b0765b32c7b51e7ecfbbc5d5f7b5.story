The chance of it happening is 20,000 to one. 

But a family has beaten the odds and welcomed a third generation of twins into their family. 

Ethan and Eilidh were born last Wednesday to the delight of their parents Derek and Ashley Whitton, who both 30.

Mrs Whitton has twin sisters, Brogan 
and Robyn, both 21, while her mother Jacqueline Glennie, 52, also has a 
twin sister Elizabeth McKenzie completing the third generation. 

Although she was shocked to discover she was expecting twins too, Mrs Whitton revealed it had been 'predicted' to happen.

Just
two years ago a physic told her she would follow the same fate as her 
mother and grandmother giving birth to her own two little bundles of 
joy.

She said: 'It’s very 
unusual for three generations of a family to have twins and it was a 
complete shock to us, I would never have believed it if you’d told me 
this a year ago.

'I
actually went to see a psychic two years ago before I was pregnant and 
she said to me that I would have twins and I was just like "uh huh, OK" 
because I don’t really believe in all that psychic stuff.

'When I did actually fall pregnant, at seven weeks I had quite bad morning sickness so my doctor sent me for an early scan.

'They found two heartbeats in the scan and that was the first time I found out I was having twins.'We all had a good laugh about it - the psychic was right all along.'

After the scan, Mrs Whitton, from Dundee, Scotland, went straight to her mother's house to tell her the news.

She
said: 'We went down to my mum’s house without telling her the news 
about the twins and we got the scans out and she didn’t realise at 
first.

'She said "oh, you’ve got two 
pictures here", but we just looked at her and then it all clicked into 
place, she couldn’t believe it.

'Everyone laughed when they found out, although my grandmother actually got quite emotional.'

Ethan, who weighed 5lb 5oz at birth, and 6lb 10oz Eilidh were born at at Ninewells Hospital, in Dundee.

But, although they have settled in at home, Mrs Whitton admits they may have to find a bigger home in the near future and has already traded her small car for a larger model.

She said: 'It’s been lovely having twins as they have been absolutely brilliant - they are so well behaved, I can’t believe it.

'The thing I’m most looking forward to is family holidays, so we can get everyone together and in fact we’re going to be having a huge Christmas celebration at Forbes of Kingennie, just outside of Dundee.

'There will be 14 of us staying in a lodge on Christmas Eve and Christmas night and it’s quite simply because none of us have big enough houses to hold that number of people.

'However, this will cause a lot of changes in our life and we’ve already had to trade in our Fiat Punto and now we’ve got a Nissan Note, just so that we’ve got more room.

'But my mum’s been fantastic and my two sisters are being really good aunties.

'To be honest though, the twins are behaving so well at the moment and are in a great routine.

'The support has been really good as everyone is taking a very active role. It might have something to do with so many twins in the family. We’re all very close.'

Bookmakers William Hill said the odds of three successive generations of twins was 20,000 to 1.

A spokesman said: 'The chances of three generations of a family having twins is extremely low and we would have to give odds of 20,000 to one on that happening.

'It would be the biggest price on our website at the moment.'
