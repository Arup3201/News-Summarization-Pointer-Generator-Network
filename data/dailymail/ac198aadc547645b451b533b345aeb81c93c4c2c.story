Warning: this video is not for the squeamish. 

YouTube user Joyson Christo uploaded a fascinating, yet squint-inducing video of a woman removing the dust and dirt trapped behind a man's eyelids... using a tiny steel rod.

And though it may seem shocking at first, the service, which costs just 25 Indian Rupees - or approximately 25 pence - is a surprisingly common occurrence.

The dust-removing service costs just 25 Indian Rupees - or about 25 pence - in Tamil Nadu, India

Captured, edited and uploaded using a Nokia N8 mobile in Tamil Nadu, approximately 70 km from the city of Tiruchirapalli, the uploader insists that the experience is 'amazing' to watch first hand.

The woman begins with the man's left eye first, inserting the tiny steel instrument up behind his eyelid.

The man doesn't even flinch as the woman moves the steel rod back and forth under the lid, cleaning out the dirt and debris, before removing the dust with her hand.

After moving back and forth, she uses her hand to extract the debris - placing it in his palm for the camera

She then places the dirt and sand that she extracted into the man's palm for the camera, before repeating the process on the other eye.

'This is fact,' YouTube user Joyson Christo wrote. 'Each and every bike rider will have sand and dust behind [their] eyelashes.'

The video currently has over 63,000 views on YouTube.
