The mayor of a small town in southwestern Missouri has resigned after angering local residents with anti-Semitic remarks he made in reference to three killings at Jewish community facilities in Kansas earlier this month.

Dan Clevenger submitted a handwritten, one-sentence letter of resignation on Tuesday as mayor of Marionville, a town of 2,225 about 240 miles southwest of St. Louis.

Clevenger had enraged the local community when he said in a televised interview last week that he ‘kind of agreed with’ the views of Frazier Glenn Cross, 73, who has been charged with murdering three people outside a Jewish community center and a retirement home in Overland Park, Kansas, on April 13.

Clevenger, who had only become mayor earlier this month, told KSPR that he had known Cross, who lived nearby, for years.

‘I kind of agreed with him on some things, but I don't like to express that too much,’ said Clevenger.

‘There's some things going on in this country that are destroying us. We've got a false economy and some of those corporations are run by Jews. The names are there.’

At a meeting of the Marionville Board of Aldermen on Monday, local residents took Clevenger to task over his comments and the board voted 4-1 to begin impeachment proceedings against him.

In his resignation letter to the board on Tuesday, Clevenger did not explain why he was stepping down, writing only: ‘I, Daniel R. Clevenger, do hereby resign as mayor of Marionville.’

His remarks had already promoted the local district attorney and an assembly woman to stand down.

Avowed white supremacist Cross, also known as Glenn Miller, has been charged with the killings of Dr. William Lewis Corporon and his 14-year-old grandson, Reat Griffin Underwood, outside the Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City on Sunday 13 April.

Cross shouted ‘heil Hitler’ at television cameras as he was arrested after the shootings.

The three people killed were Terri LaManno, left, and Dr. William Lewis Corporon and his 14-year-old grandson Reat Griffin Underwood - all three victims were Christian

He is also accused of killing Terri LaManno at a nearby Jewish retirement complex shortly after the shootings at the Jewish Community Center. All three victims were Christian.

Cross now faces a state charge of capital murder for the deaths of Corporon and Underwood and a count of first-degree premeditated murder for LaManno's death.

The charges carry the death penalty as possible punishment and Cross is being held on $10million bond.

Corporon and Underwood were at the JCC for the 'KC Superstar' competition, an American Idol-like singing contest for students. LaManno worked as an occupational therapist at the Children's Center for the Visually Impaired.
