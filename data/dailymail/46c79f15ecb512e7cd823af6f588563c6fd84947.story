A body has been found in a Minneapolis home that exploded on New Year's Day and police are still working to identify the victim.

The Thursday discovery marked the first fatality from the explosion while 14 others are said to be recovering from injuries, six of which were critical.

Some of the victims suffered burns, while others suffered trauma as they jumped to the ground from windows on the third floor.

Extremes: An explosion at this Minneapolis, Minnesota apartment building on New Year's Day left at least one person dead and 14 others injured

Investigation: Fire officials believe that the explosion was caused by natural gas but energy company executives say that they are drawing their conclusions too soon

Horrible: One person was found dead among the ruins but their identity has not yet been confirmed and two residents remain missing

'At approximately 1.55pm Minneapolis Fire Department officials confirmed that one body was discovered in the structure at 516 Cedar Ave. S,' assistant fire chief Cherie A. Penn told The Star Tribune.

Two people who lived in a second-floor apartment are still said to be missing and unaccounted for- named by relatives as 57-year-old Alhmad Ali and 60-year-old Mrimri Farah- and it is not known if either of them was the fatality.

The fatal incident is still under investigation but fire chief John Fruetel told the paper that it is believed to be the result of a natural gas leak as there is a distinctive smell in the surrounding area and witness reports would support the theory.

That contradicts gas company CenterPoint Energy's claims that they do not believe natural gas was connected to the fatal incident.

Lingering questions: A spokesman for the local energy company said that if it were a natural gas explosion, the roof and walls would have likely been blown off

Difficult: Firemen said that as they were spraying water to extinguish the flames, the water was freezing

'We had no natural gas in the area,' spokeswoman Rebecca Virden told The Tribune.

She went on to say that if natural gas was the cause, the roof would have likely 'come off, the wall would come out' but Mr Fruetel stood by the reports made by his investigators.

The three-story building, 516 Cedar Avenue, is very close to a local mosque and houses a grocery store and several apartments. Ten of the building's apartments were occupied.

Terrifying: A closer image shows flames licking the windows of the building, which has 10 apartments

Desperate: A man is seen climbing from a window towards a ladder in a desperate bid to escape the fire

Freezing conditions: The fire chief said his staff were working in 'treacherous conditions' to put out the flames

Emergency responders received the first reports of the explosion at 8.16am on Wednesday, Minneapolis Fire officials told WCCO, and arrived on the scene within minutes - but after 15 minutes they were forced to evacuate the building due to dangerous conditions.

The firefighters are battling to put out the flames and look for potential victims in freezing conditions - as temperatures plunge to a degree below freezing - raising the danger of hypothermia.Â

Temperatures were so low that water was freezing as it came out of their hoses, CNN reported.

In addition, floors inside the building have collapsed, making their mission more dangerous.

'These are very treacherous conditions,' Minneapolis Fire Chief John Fruetel said.
