Prince Harry has had a secret adviser during his hugely successful tour of the Caribbean – his brother, the Duke of Cambridge.

The two Princes have been texting each other and talking on the phone throughout the past week, with the Duke - who is currently on deployment with the RAF in the Falklands - giving his brother tips on how to strike the right balance of formality and fun.

Yesterday Prince Harry rounded off his visit to Jamaica, the last stop on his tour of Commonwealth realms to celebrate the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee, by attending a beach party on a tiny island off Montego Bay.

Dressed casually in an open-necked blue linen shirt, navy blue trousers and brown suede boots, the 27-year-old watched a show of Jamaican dance and music before mingling with invited guests including three holders of the Miss Jamaica title.

During the beach party at the Sandals Royal Caribbean resort, the Prince tapped his feet and nodded to the rhythms, and at one point mouthed the words of the Bob Marley hit Three Little Birds as a violinist played the tune.

He was also presented with a blend of 30-year-old Jamaican rum, with another bottle for his brother.

His week-long tour of Belize, the Bahamas and Jamaica has been widely lauded as a tour de force and has garnered rave reviews both at home and abroad.

Harry, who has often been the subject of less flattering headlines, is said to feel hugely encouraged by the welcome he has received and the way the visit has been portrayed.

'He is the first to admit that he wouldn't be suited to a more formal royal tour but this trip has had a hugely relaxed vibe to it and Prince Harry has tried to play to his strengths,' a source close to the prince said.

Another senior source said Prince William had also played a part in Harry’s sure-footed handling of the more formal parts of the tour.

'He spoke at length to his brother before coming out, about how to approach it, and they have been in communication throughout the tour,' they said.

'They have been in touch regularly via mobile and text. The relationship they have full of banter and humour but Prince William is deeply caring of his younger brother and wants his younger brother succeed.

'He can advise him on how to mix the informality with the dignity of [representing] the Queen.'

As
well as being aware that his brother was watching how he performed, 
Prince Harry also knows 'that the Queen is following the tour as well'.

And
Prince Charles has rung his younger son to congratulate him - and 
revealed he cried tears of laughter when he watched footage of Harry 
racing the world's fastest man, Usain Bolt, and beat him. 'The Prince of
Wales is hugely proud of what he has achieved,' said a source.

The Prince had specifically asked to tour the Caribbean, though it was the Queen who chose the countries he would visit, and he 'mugged up' on the detail of what he would be doing in each country because 'he really wanted to do the best for his grandmother and for the three countries', said the source.

'What we have seen of Prince Harry is
Prince Harry – he is just himself and he has got natural enthusiasm and
energy and is someone whose character lends itself very well to this 
region.

'He has got a 
flexible approach to his work and he has got great empathy with people; 
it’s something he innately has, it’s not something that can be taught.'

The
Prince, who will arrive in Brazil tomorrow to begin his first trade 
mission on behalf of the Government, will go straight back into training
with his Apache helicopter unit when he returns, and is unlikely to be 
available for another royal tour until next year at the earliest.

Apart
from the Diamond Jubilee weekend in June and the London 2012 Olympics, 
he will barely carry out any public duties for the rest of the year as 
he prepares for his second tour of Afghanistan.

Aides
say he is keen to carry out more tours on behalf of the Queen, but 
despite the success of this, his first, say that is a long way off.
