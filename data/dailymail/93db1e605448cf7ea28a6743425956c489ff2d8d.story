People from the north of England consider London to be chaotic, crowded and bad for Britain, according to a study released today.

Only 24 per cent of those living outside the capital think London has a positive impact on their local economy, with that figure even lower in northern cities such as Liverpool and Sheffield, where the number drops to just nine per cent and eight per cent respectively.

While two thirds of the population agree London has a positive impact on the national economy, the same number argue that the capital unfairly benefits from central government being based there.

Divide: While two thirds of the population agree London benefits the national economy (green figures), only 24 per cent of those living outside the capital think it has a positive impact at a local level (red figures)

The figures come from a report for Centre for Cities and the Centre for London, with YouGov questioning residents in 16 towns and cities across the UK.

The study confirms the suspicion of a growing divide between London and the rest of the country - something that has long been suggested by the capital's property bubble.

The results point to something a ripple effect in opinion, with the towns and cities closest to London feeling most positive about the capital'sÂ impact, and those further away feeling the least positive.

This is magnified in parts of Yorkshire, with just eight per cent of those living in Hull and Sheffield thinking London has a positive impact on their city.

The results are not must better in Leeds where the number is 13 per cent.

Unfair: Only 24 per cent of non-Londoners think the capital (pictured) has a positive impact on their local economy. Meanwhile two thirds argue London unfairly benefits from central government being based there

Ignored: Only 17 per cent of non-Londoners think Westminster politicians such as Chancellor George Osborne (left) and Prime Minister David Cameron (right) are responsive to local issues

It's not just the capital's economic impact that has been called into question. Three quarters of those asked also felt the media focuses too much on London at the expense of other British cities.

Meanwhile 64 per cent of non-Londoners claimed the government paid too much attention to issues in the capital, with only 17 per cent thinking Westminster politicians were responsive to local issues.

The only city to buck this trend was Manchester, where a slightly more positive 21 per cent either strongly agreed to tended to agree with the claim that Whitehall was in touch with local issues.

But despite feeling unhappy Londoners get a much better deal than those living in other parts of the country, only one in five said they would consider moving to the capital to improve their opportunities.

This, it was suggested, is down to a widespread belief that London is not a happy or comfortable place to live.

Responding to questions on their opinions of quality of life in the capital, 62 per cent on non-Londoners described it as 'expensive', 59 per cent as 'crowded' and 30 per cent as 'chaotic'.

Only 32 per cent thought London was a good place to raise a family.
