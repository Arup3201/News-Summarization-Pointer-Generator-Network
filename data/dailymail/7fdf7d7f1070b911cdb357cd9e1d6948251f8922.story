A rising YouTube star who invited her legion of fans to share photos of themselves, using the hashtag #bodypositive this weekend had her seemingly good intentions backfire when thousands of girls - many of them apparently in their early teens - submitted half-naked photos.

Lindsay Demeloa, who moved from her New Jersey hometown to Los Angeles a few years ago, where she later dropped out of college, shared her own scantily-clad selfie to Instagram last week, captioned: 'I love my tiny booty and stick legs, and you should love every single inch of you as well.'

Concerns have arisen over two aspects of the movement; the first being the safety issues associated with potentially underage girls exposing themselves on social media, and the second being the glorification of Lindsay's tiny frame.

Lindsay, who quickly made a name for herself as an opinion vlogger after she moved to Los Angeles, describes herself as 'too laid back to be friends with girls', and is outspoken against issues including 'slut-shaming'.

'Arch ur back in photos if u want to who cares f**k off [sic]', she tweeted last week, as photos streamed in from the worryingly young-looking female fans who seem to make up most of her fan base.

It is unclear how old Lindsay is herself, but she is thought to be in her 20s.

One respondent, 17-year-old Matthew Espinosa based in California, tweeted: 'Honestly I think this is a bad idea. Girls have to tweet pictures of they're a***s and body and that makes girls more insecure because they see all these skinny bodies [sic].'

Matthew added: 'How will this work if it's only going to make them feel more insecure? And... why the internet? They're showing off their bodies on the internet. Not a very safe place.'

Lindsay later tweeted that she was feeling 'tired n cranky' and stated: 'You can mock me and hate me all you want, but at the end of the day.. look at what you're doing.. then look at what i'm doing.'

Figure envy: Plenty of Lindsay's fans have commented on her photos with remarks including, 'I want your body when I'm older' and 'she is my stomach goal' (pictured)

Many girls tweeted snaps of their curves, stretch marks and self-harming scars, and thanked Linsday for inspiring them to be courageous about revealing themselves.

'I'm not skinny, I'm insecure about my body, but we all have to learn to love ourselves the way we are #bodypositive', tweeted one girl.

'It may be a day late but I never post full body pictures I'm hoping it's a start to self confidence,' mused another.

Plenty more, however, have commented on bikini photos of Lindsay with remarks including: 'I want your body when I'm older' and 'she is my stomach goal.'

Evidently, Lindsay is used to sparking strong reactions.

'I get so much hate a day,' she says in one video. 'Thank God I'm not one of those people who takes things to heart anymore.'
