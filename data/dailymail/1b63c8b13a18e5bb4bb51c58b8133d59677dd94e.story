A chef who murdered a mother-of-four he met on a dating website only days earlier has been jailed for a minimum of 17 years.

Kevin Hawke, 33, was told at Liverpool Crown Court today that he must serve a minimum of 17 years and six months after he admitted murdering Sharon Winters in July.

A court heard how the mother-of-four suffered 90 injuries in the brutal attack in Walton, Liverpool, most of them stab wounds.

Ms Winters was discovered within her County Road flat, next to Everton's Goodison Park, after police were called to the incident on July 13.

Hawke, of no fixed abode, but originally from Burnley, was arrested outside the property and was said to be 'very, very drunk'.

Bouquets of flowers lined the pavement outside Ms Winters' home in the wake of her murder, accompanied by emotional tributes from friends and family. 

Ms Winters was remembered by her brother Stephen as a 'lovely person who would do anything for anyone'.

He said at the time of her death: 'She will be missed so much by all of her family.

'She didn't deserve to suffer and die in this manner.

'She was a much loved sister and mother of four who will be sadly missed.'  

Hawke has been due to stand trial at Liverpool Crown Court today but changed his plea at the last minute.

He will only be considered for parole once he has served the minimum term.

Hawke, 33, was told at Liverpool Crown Court today that he must serve a minimum of 17 years and six months 

Detective Inspector Phil Mahon, from Liverpool North CID, said: 'Kevin Hawkes has today been sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his new girlfriend, Sharon Winters, and will have to serve a minimum of 17 and a half years before he can be considered for release.

'He brutally attacked Sharon in her home in County Road only days after meeting her on a dating website, leaving her with terrible injuries which tragically proved fatal.

'His actions not only deprived Sharon of the life ahead of her when she was only 39-years-old, but also took her away from her beloved family who have been left devastated by Hawke's crimes.

'Merseyside Police takes incidents of a domestic nature extremely seriously and I hope that the prison sentence Hawke's is now facing sends a strong message out to other violent offenders that we will do everything possible to bring you to justice.'
