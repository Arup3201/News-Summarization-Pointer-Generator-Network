Eintracht Frankfurt forward Alexander Meier, the Bundesliga's leading goalscorer, is out for the season with a knee injury.

The club says Meier will have surgery on his patellar tendon on Tuesday.

Meier tops the Bundesliga with 19 goals, ahead of the Bayern Munich duo of Arjen Robben (17) and Robert Lewandowski (16).

Eintracht Frankfurt hitman Alexander Meier has been ruled out for the rest of the season with a knee injury

He had scored 19 leage goals this season before his injury, but might now miss out on the Golden Boot award

1. Alexander Meier, Eintracht Frankfurt (19)

2. Arjen Robben, Bayern Munich (17)

3. Robert Lewandowski, Bayern Munich (16)

4. Bas Dost, Wolfsburg (13) 

4=. Thomas Muller, Bayern Munich (13) 

5. Franco di Santo, Werder Bremen (12)

5=. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Borussia Dortmund (12) 

Robben is also out with an injury and Lewandowski could win the scorers' title for the second year running. 

The Poland striker topped last season's scoring list with 20 goals, while still playing for previous club Borussia Dortmund. 

Bayern Munich's Arjen Robben is also out of an action with an injury after scoring 17 league goals this term

Bayern's Robert Lewandowski could be in a great position to win the Bundesliga Golden Boot once again
