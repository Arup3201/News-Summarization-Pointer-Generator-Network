A now extinct giant flightless pigeon from Mauritius used its small but deadly wings to fight off competitors and communicate with mates, according to new research published this week.

Researchers from the Natural History Museum in London studied fossils of the solitaire, officially known as Pezophaps solitaria, and in particular the unique ‘musket ball’ structure on the bird’s wing.

They discovered that the birds used the circular nodes as a way of fighting with other birds and fending off prey.

Researchers from London's Natural History Museum have discovered that the small 'musket ball' knobs found in the wings of the now extinct solitaire bird were used for fighting. This artist's impression shows what the pair of solitaires would have looked liked when fighting over territory in Anse Francois valley on the island of Rodrigues. The birds became extinct at the end of 1700s

The Rodrigues Solitaire, or pezophaps solitaria is an extinct, flightless bird that lived on the island of Rodrigues.

It was genetically similar to pigeons and doves and is most closely related to the also extinct Dodo of Mauritius.

The Rodrigues Solitaire was the size of a swan. Males were much larger than females and measured up to 35 inches in length.

Females were around 28 inches tall.

Both sexes were highly territorial, with large bony knobs on their wings that were used in combat.

The Rodrigues Solitaire laid a single egg, that was incubated in turn by both sexes.

Gizzard stones helped digest its food, which included fruit and seeds.Solitaires were first mentioned in the 17th Centuryl by François Leguat, leader of a group of French Huguenot refugees who were marooned on Rodrigues in 1691–1693.

It is the only extinct bird with a former star constellation named after it, Turdus Solitarius.

Writing in the Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, ornithologist Julian Hume from the Natural History Museum said: ‘We know from detailed historical notes from eighteenth-century sailors that the birds were aggressive.

'They also describe a musket-ball-like bony growth on the wings, which was originally thought to be the result of injury.

When we compared the wings of solitaire fossils from the caves of Rodrigues, an outer island of Mauritius, to modern birds we found that these growths were largest in adult males.

'This means they were probably important in fighting, like a fighter’s fist.’

Ornithologists had previously thought that the musket ball growth in these birds was the result of disease or injury.

Fractures found during previous studies of the extinct birds' bones confirm that they were aggressive animals. The solitaire was highly territorial and would fight regularly. It is thought the small knobs found on their wings may have been caused by fighting, but then evolved to make them better competitors

Researchers now believe that the structures grew as a result of combat or due to hormones when birds paired up to mate and defended their territory.

Many solitaire fossils contain healed fractures which supports this idea.

‘There are no living giant flightless pigeons for us to refer to, but museum collections such as those at the Natural History Museum contain thousands of solitaire fossils,’ said Dr Lorna Steel, a curator at the Natural History Museum.

'It is unlikely that the birds used the spurs solely for fighting as they also communicated with each other using their wings. Historical records talk of people hearing the sound from almost 200 metres away.'

The now extinct solitaire birds from the island of Rodrigues are now thought to have been aggressive and territorial. They were reminiscent of the birds that star in the Angry Birds game from developers Rovio. Each bird is designed to destroy the egg-stealing pigs in a specific way

It is thought that the knobs were a result of fighting and the Mauritian birds then evolved so the knobs developed naturally

The solitaires became extinct at the end of the 1700s but were genetically similar to modern-day pigeons
