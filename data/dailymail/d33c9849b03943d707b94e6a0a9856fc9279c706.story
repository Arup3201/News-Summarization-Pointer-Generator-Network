Ed Miliband was monstered on the radio yesterday by a stay-at-home mother who accused him of viewing her contribution as ‘worthless’.

Imogen Thompson, who has two children aged six and three, told the Labour leader he put ‘no value’ on women like her who choose not to work.

The campaigner, from the group Mothers At Home Matter, said Labour was only interested in women who take jobs – spending millions subsidising childcare.

Monstered: Ed Miliband was taken to task on the radio by a stay-at-home mother who accused him of viewing her contribution as 'worthless' 

During the public Q&A on LBC radio, Mr Miliband was also attacked by a small business owner who said he could not see him as a potential prime minister.

In an uncomfortable series of calls for the Labour leader, a midwife said his party’s immigration policies had put the NHS under pressure, while another caller said Labour was for the ‘Islington elite’ rather than the working man.

His mauling by Mrs Thompson, 35, comes a year after Nick Clegg was taken to task by another stay-at-home mother on his own LBC phone-in show, Call Clegg.

Laura Perrins, 32, said the Coalition was ‘discriminating against mothers like me’, adding: ‘You probably think what I do is a worthless job.’

The Coalition angered many stay-at-home mothers after the election with its measures to cut child benefit for higher earners.

Yesterday Mr Miliband said he would not reverse the policy, claiming there was no money to do so.

Mrs Thompson, from Manchester, said nothing was being done to stop stay-at-home parents being ‘penalised in the tax system’.

She added: ‘My husband is the sole earner in our household.

‘We have forfeited my salary in order to provide the childcare at home, we can’t make use of my personal tax allowance – I can’t transfer a penny to him. There are no tax allowances that recognise family care responsibilities as in other OECD countries. We are out of step in the UK.

‘At the same time the current Coalition are introducing tax-free childcare schemes for parents who are both in employment up to £300,000 for a household.

‘In addition the Coalition have removed child benefit from households on a fraction of this.

‘So single income families like mine pay a disproportionate amount of tax which eats into the amount left to house, clothe, feed and raise my children.’ When Mr Miliband replied: ‘I can’t give you an easy answer. I don’t have an easy solution to this problem,’ she said: ‘I don’t think you have any answer.’

The Labour leader told her: ‘I wouldn’t have chosen to make the child benefit change but we’re going to have trouble reversing that.’

Asked whether he would allow mothers to transfer their tax allowance to their partner, he said: ‘I would love to do all this, but where’s the money going to come from?’

Mrs Thompson replied: ‘Mr Miliband, you’re putting no value on unpaid care at home. You are saying that the unpaid work that I do is worthless.’ 

Last night Mrs Thompson, a former marketing executive, told the Mail: ‘I think Ed Miliband’s reaction was a bit disappointing. He admitted he had no answers for me. They say they value stay-at-home parents but there’s no evidence.’

Mr Miliband also spoke about his decision to stand against his brother David in the Labour leadership election four years ago, saying it showed he has a ‘tough’ streak.
