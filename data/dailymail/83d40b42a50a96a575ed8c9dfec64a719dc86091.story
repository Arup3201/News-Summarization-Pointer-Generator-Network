Alleged thief: David Mejias, 44, was accused of taking a bracelet and a pocket-book from his ex

A politician who once ran for Congress has been arrested after allegedly stealing a bracelet and a $3,000 Louis Vuitton pocketbook from his ex's apartment.

David Mejias, 44, a Democrat, was accused of entering the 35-year-old woman's home without permission.

The lawmaker is accused of swiping the book from a counter-top at her home in Garden City, New York, around 11pm Thursday, police said.

When confronted by her, he allegedly refused to leave and pushed into the woman's bedroom and took her $800 bracelet as well, the Long Island Press reported.

She called 911, but Mejias, a domestic violence attorney, had left by the time police arrived. He has pleaded not guilt to charges of grand larceny and possession of stolen property.

Mejias was for years part of the legislature for Nassau County, New York. He tried for a seat in the House of Representatives in 2006, but missed out.

He also stood for the New York state senate in 2010, but pulled out when allegations surfaced that he was stalking an ex-girlfriend.

He was arrested for the alleged stalking, but the case was dismissed. It is unclear whether she was the same woman whose property he is now accused of taking.

Mejias's attorney would not comment on the allegations, except to say that he had not been accused of violence. He is due to appear in court  in late November. If convicted, Mejias could face years in prison.
