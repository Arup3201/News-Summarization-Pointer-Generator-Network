Afghan police have arrested 26 people over the murder of a woman savagely beaten to death in the streets of Kabul after wrongly being accused of burning the Koran.

Farkhunda, 27, was pushed from a roof, run over by a car and set on fire before her body was thrown in the Kabul River - in full view of several policeman - last Thursday.

On Sunday, grieving women carried the religious scholar's coffin through the streets of the Afghan capital in a dramatic departure from local custom. Pallbearers are traditionally men.

It comes as protesters wearing masks of  Farkhunda's bloodied face have marched on Kabul to demand justice for the young teacher. 

In unprecedented scenes grieving women in the Afghan capital of Kabul have carried the coffin of a woman savagely beaten to death after being wrongly accused of burning the Koran.

Senior police officials have since confirmed that they believe the Koran-burning allegations that prompted the attack were false.

Members of Farkhunda's family have denied reports that she was mentally ill, claiming this was a made-up defence to protect her reputation.

Her father said the 27-year-old worked as an Islamic studies teacher studies and could recite the Koran by heart. He insisted she was not involved in burning the Muslim holy book. 

'Farkhunda was a deeply religious girl. She used to recite the holy Koran and pray five times a day,' her brother Najeebullah Malikzada said today. 

Protesters who gathered near the Shah Doshamshera mosque today demanded the government prosecute all those responsible for the death of Farkhunda, who like many Afghans used only one name.

Many women in the crowd wore masks of Farkhunda's battered and bloodied face, which has appeared widely on social media. They carried a banner accusing the government of broking promises to end corruption and bring rule of law to Afghanistan

Farkhunda's body was dragged 300 meters (980 feet) along the road in front of the mosque and thrown into the river

Officials said that 26 people have been arrested, and 13 policemen based in the area of the mosque have been suspended amid allegations they stood by and did nothing to stop the attack.

One policeman who was present during the attack said the police were overwhelmed by the size of the crowd, which grew throughout the attack.

Sayed Habid Shah said that Farkhunda and a fortune teller at the small shrine next to the mosque began arguing, when the fortune teller accused her of burning the Koran.

'She said I am a Muslim and Muslims do not burn the Koran,' Shah  said.

'As more people gathered, the police were trying to push them away, but it got out of control.

'The people pulled her into a corner of the yard and beat her with sticks, and one man took a large stone and dropped it on her. That was the end,' Shah said.

Farkhunda's body was then dragged 300 meters (980 feet) along the road in front of the mosque and thrown into the river, he said.

Social activists on Monday planted a pine tree on the riverbank spot where Farkhunda's body was set alight.

The demonstrators, many of them members of the Solidarity Party of Afghanistan, blocked the road outside the mosque and marched along the riverside route, starting from where the attack began.

Many women in the crowd wore masks of Farkhunda's battered and bloodied face, which has appeared widely on social media. They carried a banner accusing the government of broking promises to end corruption and bring rule of law to Afghanistan.

Palwasha, who described herself as a social activist, said: 'We demand that the government ensure that all those involved are arrested and that they face an open trial so that justice is implemented and they become an example for others.'

A man prepares for the burial of Farkhunda. The 27-year-old woman killed by an angry mob in front of police in the Afghan capital last week for allegedly burning a copy of Islam's holy book was wrongly accused, Afghanistan's top criminal investigator said

Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who took office in September voicing support for women's rights, is currently in Washington on his first state visit to the United States.  Before his departure, he called the killing of Farkhunda a 'heinous attack,' and ordered an investigation.

Ghani's wife, Rula, who has spoken up on women's rights, has yet to make a public statement — disappointing some rights activists including film director Sahraa Karimi. 'This is typical of the women in positions of influence in Afghanistan —talking talking no action. How can they be our representatives,' Karimi said

More demonstrations are planned throughout the week to maintain pressure on the authorities to ensure that women's constitutional rights to equality and protection from violence are respected at every level of society, activists said. 

Farkhunda's funeral was attended by dozens of women's rights activists, several of whom also helped carry her coffin, demanding justice for the young teacher.

The mob could be seen stamping on the woman while some stamped on her repeatedly and battered her body with pieces of wood and bricks

'This is a crime against this family, a crime against a sister and a crime against humanity,' said Bari Salam, a human rights activist.

'All those involved and all those who supported her killing should be brought to justice,' he said. 

President Ashraf Ghani condemned the killing as 'heinous' and ordered a commission to investigate the incident.

He said police, who play a crucial part in the war against Taliban insurgents, were not well-trained to contain such incidents.

'Almost 90 per cent of the duties of the police today are focused on fighting, which is not their constitutional role, it is not their legal role,' Ghani told reporters on Saturday.

'Focusing on civilian capabilities, on enforcement of the rule of law, is key to us.'

In a statement on Sunday, the interior ministry said 13 police officers were suspended, including the police chief responsible for the area.

Police separately said they arrested 21 people, including eight policemen.

'I will question the police... we have started our inquiry,' General Zahir Zahir, head of criminal investigation at the interior ministry, said today.

'Even If I get killed, I won't let any of her perpetrators get away with it,' he added.
