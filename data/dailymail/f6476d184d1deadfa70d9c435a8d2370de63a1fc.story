An Ohio father allegedly fled the scene of an accident in which his own son died, after being hit by the minivan the father was driving, the day after Christmas.

Authorities say the four-year-old son of Natividad de Jesus Hernandez, 30, fell from the minivan Hernandez was driving and was hit by the car.

A witness to the incident says Hernandez stayed on the scene with the child until an ambulance arrived, then jumped back in the van and drove away.

According to NBC 4, the boy, identified as four-year-old Angel Gustbabo Hernandez, fell from a moving vehicle in Union County Thursday morning.

The Associated Press reports that the boy opened the handle of the van's sliding doors and tumbled from the vehicle.

His father was driving a 1997 Chevrolet Venture minivan from a construction site on Brock Road at about 11:05am when the child fell from the vehicle and was hit by the van.

Bereaved: Hernandez does not speak English well and was confused and unsure of what to do after the accident

A 911 caller said Hernandez held the child tightly after the accident until emergency services arrived.

He then immediately left the scene without speaking to police officers about the accident.

According to the Arizona Star, Patrol Lieutenant Molly Clemems said Hernandez does not speak English fluently and was confused as to what he should do.

His vehicle was later found at the Ohio Health Dublic Methodist Hospital, where the child had been transported by paramedics.

He has been charged with leaving the scene of a crash, a felony charge.

Flight risk: The imprisoned father fled the scene of the accident, but drove straight to the hospital where his young son was pronounced dead

According to ABC 6, Hernandez is being held on a $500,000 bond and must front the entire sum before he can be released. Authorities believe he poses a flight risk.

The child was reportedly not wearing a seatbelt or child restraint when he fell from the vehicle. He was pronounced dead upon arrival at the hospital.

Jail records said Hernandez is charged with failure to exchange information after an accident, a third-degree felony.

A scheduled appearance Friday in Marysville municipal court was postponed because Hernandez doesn't understand English well enough, Trooper Jeremy Allen said. He'll remain jailed until the rescheduled Monday morning hearing. No attorney information was available.
