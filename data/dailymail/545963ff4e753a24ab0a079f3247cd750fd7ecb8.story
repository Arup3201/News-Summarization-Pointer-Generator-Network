A hospital has taken extreme measures in response to this winter's flu outbreak and is cordoning off sufferers in quarantine-like tents in the parking lot.

Lehigh Valley Hospital-Cedar Crest in Pennsylvania created an outdoor area on Tuesday to treat patients with flu symptoms after four people died of complications from the virus.

The tent is 1,100 square feet and is equipped to treat six patients at a time with three medical staff. Access to a doctor is available inside the emergency room.

Extreme: The precaution comes as this year's flu season is said to be one of the worst ever

The tent is only for those with mild 
flu symptoms while those who have severe cases, need intravenous drips 
or have underlying health conditions are taken into the hospital.

Terry Burger, hospital director of infection control, told NBC: 'If we can remove them from the main Emergency Department 
and put them in environment where everyone is masked and everyone can be
protected, it's safer for them and certainly safer for the staff.'

The last time a tent was erected outside the emergency room was during the H1N1 outbreak several years ago. 

The flu triage tent began operating at 11am on Tuesday and closes at 11pm each night.

Officials believe this year will be a particularly bad outbreak of the flu virus  - known as H3N2 - and treating patients in isolation is the best way of keeping cases at bay. 

The Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention said that 200,000 people across the country have been 
hospitalized with this year's strain so far.

Dozens of states including Pennsylvania and New Jersey have reported high outbreaks. Across the U.S., 19 children have so far died from the flu.

The elderly, the very young and those with previous health conditions are most at risk.

The CDC recommends that individuals get a flu shot which prevents against getting the virus in 90 per cent of cases.
