Desperately clutching the body of his young son to his chest, tears stream down the face of Jihad Masharawi moments after he was told by doctors his little boy was dead.

‘What did my son do to die like this?,’ he pleaded, ‘What was his mistake? He is 11 months-old, what did he do?’

Tiny Omar is the youngest casualty of the conflict in Gaza and Israel, which last night, threatened to escalate. He died after an Israeli airstrike on Hamas militants in Gaza from a rocket fired by Palestinians that fell short of its target in Israel.

Today Hamas fired missiles into southern Israel. Last night air sirens were heard in Tel Aviv. Fifteen Palestinians and three Israelis have so far been killed.

Father's grief: BBC journalist Jihad Masharawi weeps while he holds the body of his 11-month old son Omar, at Shifa hospital

Respects: Today was the funeral of 11-month-old Omar al-Masharawi killed probably by a Palestinian rocket

A photographer and picture editor for
 the BBC, Masharawi had arrived at Gaza’s Shifa Hospital after Omar 
suffered severe burns in an airstrike that sent shrapnel tearing into 
his home killing a woman and leaving his brother and uncle critically 
injured.

Dozens of casualties from the conflict were being treated at the hospital as a distraught Masharawi 
said : 'My son was an 
innocent.’

But as Hamas retaliated with a blitz 
or some 200 rockets into Israel following the assassination of its 
military leader Ahmed Jabari there were civilian victims there too after
 three people died when a four-storey building in the town of Kiryat 
Malachi, 15 miles north of Gaza, was hit as the residents sat down to 
breakfast.

Toast and jam still lay on the 
kitchen table yesterday covered by dust and broken glass as angry 
residents turned on politicans claimed not enough had been done to 
protect them.

Last night a Hamas rocket reached the
 southern outskirts of Tel Aviv, Israel’s commercial and cultural 
capital, by far the farthest strike into Israel in two days of 
increasingly bitter fighting.

It landed in Rishon Lezion, a city 
just south of Tel Aviv located in heavily populated central Israel, and 
while it caused no damage or injuries, it underlined the growing 
capabilities of Gaza militants.

Earlier Hamas claimed it had fired a 
one-tonne, Iranian-made Fajr 5 rocket at Tel Aviv, 40 miles north of 
Gaza, but it is believed this one was shot down.

Warning sirens sounded across the 
city last night as militants boasted of being able to strike deeper into
 Israel than ever before.

Massive explosions rocked Gaza as 
airstrikes, tanks and naval ships struck at launch sites, sending plumes
 of debris and thick black smoke hundreds of feet into the air while 
over Israel the clear blue skies were dotted by vapour trails from 
missiles and warplanes.

Anxious residents of southern towns 
waited for the wail of sirens to send them to shelters and watched as a 
series of spectacular mid-air explosions marked the impact of missiles 
from Israel’s defensive Iron Dome interceptor system with those 
in-coming from Gaza.

Funeral: Thousands of people gathered in the Gaza Strip yesterday for the funeral of Ahmed Ja'abari, the commander of the military wing of the Palestinian Hamas movement. His casket was being taken to the al-Omari mosque in Gaza City for a prayer service before burial

Israel said dozens were destroyed but
 some made it through with two babies and a four-year-old wounded in 
Kiryat Malachi alongside the two women and a man killed. Officials said 
the dead had ignored warnings to take shelter.

The deaths and the intensity of 
rocket fire has led to fears that Israel is preparing to launch a 
full-scale military invasion of the Gaza Strip with Israel’s prime 
minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning the army is prepared for a 
‘significant widening’ of its operations.

He described Gaza as a ‘terrorist 
stronghold’ from where more than 1,000 rockets had been fired into 
Israel this year and claimed rocket launchers had been deliberately 
placed near schools and hospitals.

‘No government would tolerate a 
situation where nearly a fifth of its people live under a constant 
barrage of rockets and missile fire, and Israel will not tolerate this 
situation,’ he said.

‘This is why my government has 
instructed the Israeli Defence Forces to conduct surgical strikes 
against the terrorist infrastructure in Gaza. And this is why Israel 
will continue to take whatever action is necessary to defend our 
people.’ The fighting, the heaviest in four years, has brought life to a
 standstill on both sides of the border, with schools cancelled and 
people huddled indoors.

Israeli Transport Minister Israel 
Katz said that ‘if the shooting doesn’t stop, Israel will also target 
Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh’ - a move that might draw Egypt 
further into the crisis.

Egypt’s Islamist president Mohammed 
Morsi today ordered his prime minister to lead a senior delegation to 
Gaza in a show of support for the coastal strip’s Hamas rulers.

He has vowed to work to stop Israel’s
 campaign, calling the Jewish state’s actions there ‘unacceptable’ in 
his first public comments on the crisis on his country’s doorstep.

Foreign Secretary William Hague said 
he was ‘gravely concerned’ by the situation in Gaza, adding ‘Hamas bears
 principal responsibility for the current crisis', also urging all the 
sides involved to “avoid any action which risks civilian casualties or 
escalates the crisis.’ Mr Hague said the latest crisis underlined the 
urgent need for ‘progress toward a two-state solution which allows 
Israelis and Palestinians to live alongside each other in peace and 
security’.

Hamas announced a state of emergency 
in Gaza, evacuating all its security buildings and deploying its troops 
away from their locations while schools have been ordered closed until 
the operation ends with most of the territory’s 1.6 million people only 
venturing out from shelters to buy food, fuel and other basic supplies.

Few in the territory’s largest urban 
area, Gaza City, came out following the call for dawn prayers, and the 
only vehicles plying the streets were ambulances and media cars.

Most Gazans remained in their homes, following developments on Hamas-run TV and local radio stations.

‘I am trying to calm my children when
 they hear the sound of explosions,’ said Zainab Nimr, a 33-year-old 
mother of three. ‘We have enough food and water for four days, so I 
asked my husband to go out and get extra supplies. No one knows when 
this will end.’ Thousands of people, including top Hamas officials, 
braved the threats to attend the funeral for Jabari

‘We want to kill in the name of God,’
 chanted mourners as angry gunmen fired automatic weapons into the air. 
Hundreds of people raised their index fingers in the air, chanting, ‘God
 is great.’

 An earlier version of this article stated there had been an attack in Gaza by an Israeli rocket.  Following later information, the report has been amended to state that the attack was probably a Palestinian rocket that fell short of Israel.
