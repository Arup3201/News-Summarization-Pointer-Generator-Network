The number of people arriving in the UK from the rest of Europe surged by 27 per cent last year, new figures showed today.

In a major blow for David Cameron on the day of European elections, the data confirms that net migration into the UK is running at more than twice his target of cutting it to the ‘tens of thousands’.

The Office for National Statistics said there had been a surge in people coming for work, with the biggest rise amongst people from elsewhere in the European Union.

Tory leader David Cameron had set a target of bringing net migration to below 100,000, which now seems almost impossible to meet

Throughout last year a total of 201,000 
EU citizens arrived in the UK, a ‘statistically significant increase 
from 158,000 the previous year’, the ONS said.

In 2013 a total of 526,000 people moved to the UK and 314,000 left, giving a net migration figure of 212,000.

This is up from 177,000 in 2012, and level with the year to the end of September.

The number of people arriving was up 5 per cent year-on-year, with 43,000 more EU citizens and 11,000 fewer non-EU citizens arriving.

Among those coming from across Europe, 125,000 came to find work, up from 95,000 in 2012.

There was a dramatic rise in the 
number of people from Romania and Bulgaria moving to the UK, even before
 work restrictions were lifted on January 1 this year.

A total of 23,000 people travelled from the two countries in 2013, up from just 9,000 the previous year.

The largest increases in new registrations for National Insurance numbers - needed to work and claim benefits - were also among citizens of Romania - up 29,000 to 47,000.

Other large increases were among people from Poland (up 11,000 to 102,000), Italy (up 9,000 to 42,000) and Bulgaria (up 7,000 to 18,000) from the previous year

Some 70 per cent of people from Romania and Bulgaria arrived for work-related reasons.

It
 follows figures last week which showed an estimated 122,000 Romanians 
and Bulgarians were employed in the UK in the first three months of 
2014, up from 103,000 in the same period in 2013.

Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: 'Despite the Government's best efforts and repeated commitments to reducing the net migration figure it has remained the same.

'Controlling EU migration is impossible without reform. It is clear that their aim is unrealistic and unachievable. The Government should drop their target now.

'The flood of immigrants from Romania and Bulgaria has not arrived and these figures show that they were already in the country.

'The need for estimates is plainer than ever. Only by knowing the facts can we ensure that the immigration debate cannot be hijacked by those looking to stir up racial tensions.'

The issue of immigration has dominated campaigning in the European elections, with Ukip seeking to capitalise on public anger to top the polls.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage said today: 'With under a year left to the general election the verdict is clear.

'David Cameron has broken his solemn promise to the British people on one of the most important political issues.

'And
 he has done so because he refuses to take back control of our borders 
in respect of more than 400million people from more than two dozen 
countries on continental Europe.'

Ukip leader Nigel Farage said the Tories had broken their promise to voters

Tory immigration minister James Brokenshire said: 'Uncontrolled, mass immigration makes it difficult to maintain social cohesion, puts pressure on our public services and forces down wages for people on low incomes.

'While recent net migration levels remain stable the figures show that it has fallen by a third since its peak in 2005 under the last government and that this Government's reforms have cut net migration from outside the EU to levels not seen since the late 1990s.

'We are building an immigration system that is fair to British citizens and legitimate migrants and tough on those who abuse the system or flout the law. We want to ensure that people come to the UK for the right reasons - to work hard and contribute to our economy and society.'

At the weekend Mr Cameron sought to play down the Tory pledge to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands.

The promise in the Conservative's 2010 manifesto is not official government policy because the Lib Dems have always refused to sign up to it.

Challenged about his chances of meeting the target before the 2015 election, Mr Cameron told Sky News: 'We are working towards it, we are doing everything we can to deliver on it and we should continue to do that.'

He went on: 'I want to see net migration down to the tens of thousands not only because it is right for the British economy because we should be training our own people for these jobs.

'But also if you look back to the 1980s when net migration was in the tens of thousands, we were an open economy then.

'But do you know what, immigration wasn’t a big political issue because it was properly under control and that’s what I want to achieve again.'

Yvette Cooper, Labour’s shadow home secretary, said: 'David Cameron and Theresa May's flagship immigration pledge is in shreds.

'They promised ‘no ifs, no buts’ to get their net migration target down to the tens of thousands by the end of the Parliament, and the actual figure is over twice that.

'By making such loud promises and failing to meet them, Theresa May and David Cameron have further eroded trust on immigration and undermined confidence in a government’s ability to address people’s concerns.'
