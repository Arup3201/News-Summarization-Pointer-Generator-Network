A triathlete who runs marathons across the globe to honour her cancer victim father has become the youngest person ever to complete a marathon in Antarctica - at just 14.

Winter Vinecki braved temperatures of -25Cs during the race and is now on course to become the youngest person to complete a marathon on all seven continents.

The schoolgirl, from Michigan in the U.S., finished 11th overall in the Antarctica Marathon and was the third female to finish with an impressive time of 4 hours 49 minutes.

Bracing: Winter endured temperatures of -25C on the run and achieved an impressive time of under five hours

She ran the marathon in March in memory of dad Michael who died of prostate cancer in 2008, surrounded by his family.

She said: 'I got this world record not for me, but in memory of my dad and the one in six men affected by prostate cancer.

'It was one ice-covered hill after another.

'But I found myself to be one of the few people who did not fall during the entire race.'

After losing her dad at just nine, Winter set up Team Winter, a nonprofit organisation to raise money for research into prostate cancer and awareness.

Winter began her charitable work in 
the six weeks after her father was diagnosed with sarcomatoid carcinoma 
of the prostate. He died after fighting the illness for ten months.

She has since raised more than £150,000 using her skills as a triathlete.

She said: 'I'll do everything I can to put an end to prostate cancer and help find a cure, so other families don't have to endure the hardships that I faced.'

Incredibly, after completing the gruelling 26 mile course, Winter joined her mum on the final leg of her race - running a further 4.18 miles.

She said: 'I felt doing one more lap and taking in all the Antarctica scenery and wildlife was an opportunity I might never get again.'

The race was Winter's third long distance challenge.

She has previously run the Eugene Marathon in North America and Amazing Measal Marathon in Africa, and plans to complete her marathon world record attempt by the end of the year.

Winter has signed up for some of the hardest races in the world including the Inca Trail in Machu Picchu, Peru, and the original Pheidippides run from Marathon to Athens, Greece, in November 2013.

Winter says her races are much more than putting one foot in front of the other - they are also a great learning experience.

She said: 'At the Eugene Marathon, I treasured running in the footsteps of Steve Prefontaine - an athlete whose life was cut short.

'In Kenya I learned the true value of helping girls get an educate and in Antarctica I was given was the opportunity to learn and explore.

'The race ended up being maybe only ten per cent of this voyage, learning how we can preserve this continent was the remaining ninety per cent.'
