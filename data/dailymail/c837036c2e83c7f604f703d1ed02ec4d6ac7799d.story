He bought four houses surrounding his multi-million dollar home after discovering that a developer planned to turn one of them into a huge estate that would have 'a direct view into his bedroom'.

Now, it has emerged that Mark Zuckerberg is locked in a legal battle with his backdoor neighbor, Mircea Voskerician, who sold the Facebook CEO the property in 2013 instead of fulfilling his plans.

Voskerician has claimed Zuckerberg promised him entree into the Silicon Valley elite in exchange for the  house in Palo Alto, California, which the developer then sold the rights to  at a 'discount rate'.

He is now suing the 30-year-old billionaire, who lives in his adjacent mansion with his wife, Priscilla Chan, based on allegations including fraud and misrepresentation. Zuckerberg denies the claims.

And in new court papers, Voskerician's realtor openly mocks the Facebook founder, who her refers to as 'just a kid.'

Lawsuit: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg (left) is locked in a legal battle with developer, Mircea Voskerician (right), who sold him the contractual rights to a property in Palo Alto, California, for $1.7million in 2013

Next-door neighbors: In November 2012, Voskerician reportedly sent Zuckerberg a letter saying he planned to tear down the property behind his home and replace it with a 9,600sq-ft mansion. Above, the two properties

In November 2012, Voskerician reportedly sent Zuckerberg a letter saying he planned to tear down the property behind his home and replace it with a 9,600sq-ft mansion, which he would then sell.

'The real estate developer was going to build a huge house and market the property as being next door to Mark Zuckerberg,' a source told The San Jose Mercury News at the time.

In the letter, Voskerician apparently told the tech executive, who is worth an estimated $33billion, that the mansion would have a direct view of his home, including his 'yard and master bedroom'.

If 'Mark plans to live there long term, he has 'one shot to ensure his privacy is where it needs to be,' the developer wrote in an email to once of Zuckerberg's people, according to Bloomberg.

However, he then made Zuckerberg an unusual offer. Deeming himself a 'good neighbor', he proposed to sell  a slice of the property at '100 per cent premium' to grant him more privacy.

Two weeks later, the pair came to the agreement that Zucerkberg would buy Voskerician's contractual rights to the entire house for $1.7million, which the latter described as a 'steep discount'.

The billionaire subsequently snapped up a further three homes nearby to guarantee his privacy.

In a  lawsuit, which is ongoing, Voskerician claims that Zuckerberg promised to introduce him to valuable contacts in Silicon Valley in exchange for the sale of the property, it is reported.

In an April 13, 2013, email, the developer, who lives in Palo Alto with his wife, Eva, told Zuckerberg: 'First I am happy that I could maintain your privacy by selling you the Hamilton property.

'Second, I wanted to meet and shake hands for the transaction and discuss your offering of working with you in the future as you stated you have built Facebook on connections that you have with others in Silicon Valley.'

He also told Zuckerberg one of the reasons he  sold him the house, aside from privacy, was 'your offering to help me get my homes, development projects, in front of your Facebook employees'.

Voskerician says that although both he and Zuckerberg agreed on the deal, nothing was put into writing. However, the Facebook founder's lawyers have strongly denied the claims. 

Email exchanges suggest that Zuckerberg and his inner circle had no intention of helping Voskerician in anything other than a 'light' way. But the developer's lawyer has disputed this.

Unless both parties reach a deal, the case will go to trial. If Voskerician wins, he may be awarded back the property, situated in Hamilton Avenue in the once-ordinary California area. 

Couple: After paying Voskerician $1.7million for the rights to the property, Zuckerberg reportedly bought the lot from its owners for a total of $4.8million. Above, Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, in November

 In emails, Makan described Voskerician's offer to maintain Zuckerberg's privacy on his conditions as an 'obscene proposal', while the CEO's wife  said it made her 'sad and angry'.

Over several months, Voskerician allegedly kept sending emails to Zuckerg's team, prompting them to worry that he could cause problems from 'either a security or PR standpoint'.

In an email, Zuckerberg's assistant, Andrea Besmehn, reportedly told the firm's head of executive protection that the billionaire 'does remember saying that he would help this guy in a "light" way.'

After paying Voskerician $1.7million for the rights to the disputed property in 2013, Zuckerberg reportedly bought the lot from its owners for a total of $4.8million. 

Voskerician claims his interest in the property was worth far more than $1.7million, saying the discount was based on the prestigious contacts Zuckeberg had allegedly promised him.

Makan's firm later bought  three other homes surrounding Zuckerberg's house - which is less than a 10-minute drive away from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park - to secure his privacy.

The houses in Palo Alto, situated 35 miles south of San Francisco and 14 miles north of San Jose, were reportedly snapped up for $10.5million, $14million, and $14.5million.

In addition to claims of fraud and misrpresentation, the lawsuit also accuses Zuckerberg of breach of contract. Voskerician's and Zuckerberg's lawyers declined to comment on the article.
