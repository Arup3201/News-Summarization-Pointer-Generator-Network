Barcelona president Joseph Maria Bartomeu says he is 'convinced' that Luis Suarez will have his four month ban for biting reduced.

Suarez's appeal, backed by the Uruguayan FA (UAF), was turned down by FIFA, but the case is now going to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). 

Bartomeu told Barcelona's official website that the club supported the appeal, and promised that they would help Suarez fully reintegrate into football once he returns.

New arrival: Suarez joined Barcelona from Liverpool this week for £75million despite being banned for four months

The bite: The Uruguayan is appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport to have the ban reduced

'We are supporting the appeal being made by the Uruguayan Federation to the CAS and are convinced that FIFA’s initial sanction will be reduced.

'He recognised his mistake and Barça will be making sure he successfully reintegrates into the football world'.

Suarez signed for the club for £75million, despite the ban from all football for biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini, and Bartomeu believes that, after the ban, he will become an important player for the Catalan club.

Support: Barcelona have backed Suarez's appeal and are 'convinced' the punishment will be reduced

Sorry sight: Suarez has 'recognised his mistake' which saw him leave toothmarks on Chiellini's shoulder

'Suárez will bring his top qualities as a footballer, with goals and the desire to compete and win.

'We’ll all help him and his family to adapt quickly to Barcelona and the team'.

Barcelona will follow their signing of Suarez with more activity in the transfer market, as new manager Luis Enrique looks to build a team.

The Spanish giants have already brought in goalkeepers Claudio Bravo and Marc-Andre ter Stegen, while midfielders Cesc Fabregas and Alexis Sanchez have been allowed to leave.

Quality: Barcelona president  Bartomeu says the Uruguayan 'will bring his top qualities as a footballer'

More to come: Suarez's arrival is Barca's third signing of the summer and they will continue to spend

Replaceable: Barcelona are going to continue to spend after selling Fabregas and Sanchez this summer

'We are focusing our efforts on finding what the coaches need, which as you know still means we have to sign some new players. Probably in defence'.

'The end of the World Cup will clearly revitalise the market. A lot of teams have been waiting until now to make their signings. Everybody was sure that that their players values could change in Brazil'.
