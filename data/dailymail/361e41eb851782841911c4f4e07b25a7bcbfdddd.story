When the Duchess of Cambridge wore that
 blue Issa dress for her engagement announcement in 2010, she sparked 
one of the first of many 'Kate Middleton fashion frenzies'.

The
 £522 dress, a silk wrap design by Brazilian designer Daniella Helayel, 
was subsequently reproduced in the same sapphire shade and went on to 
sell out again and again on net-a-porter and in Harvey Nichols, as 'copy-Kates' rushed out to emulate their style icon.

And now, Issa London is joining forces with high-street store Banana Republic to unveil a collection of mid-range clothes.

The brand, also supported by model Cara Delevingne and Prime Minister David Cameron's wife Samantha, will reveal a 40-piece partnership with Banana Republic.

Priced between £25 and £100 per piece, the new collection is much more modestly-priced than Issa's own brand.

Launching on 13 August, the line will be carried in 700 stores globally, as well as online.

The boho-inspired line will reportedly feature kimono, wrap-tie and pleated dresses in patterns and block colours, as well as range of jewellery and accessories.

Speaking about the upcoming collaboration, Simon Kneen, Banana Republic's creative director and executive vice president of design, told WWD: 'We always love animal prints such as zebra and giraffe stripes.

'Issa took that and modernised it. I love that the collection is our world and their world.'

Both Cara Delevingne and Jourdan Dunn walked in the Issa catwalk earlier this year.

While designers were bending over backwards to get model-of-the-moment Cara on their catwalk during London Fashion Week, she said she wanted to walk for Issa because its bohemian style was right up her street.

Camilla Al Fayed, friends with
 Issa founder and designer Daniella Helayal, decided to buy a majority 
stake in the company and is now spearheading their global expansion.

It was when the company was on the 
brink of collapse in 2011 that Al Fayed stepped in to buy out a 51 per 
cent stake, effectively saving the brand which showed a stunning Navajo 
collection at London Fashion Week last month.
