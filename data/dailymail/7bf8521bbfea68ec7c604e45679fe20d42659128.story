Back pay: John Zelepos, owner of Mystic Pizza, is being forced to pay back wages to 110 employees

A Connecticut restaurant owner will pay a total of more than $105,000 in back pay to 110 employees after cheating them out of wages for more than two years.

The State of Connecticut Department of Labor began investigating Mystic Pizza  owner John Zelepos after receiving three individual complaints from mis- or unpaid employees, NBC Connecticut reports. 

The investigation found that Zelepos reportedly has more than 150 minimum wage and overtime violations where employees received less than minimum wage or did not receive required overtime pay.

The DOL reports that Zelepos paid employees working as hosts, cooks, and dishwashers as little as $5.69 an hour. Others received $7.40 an hour, but, at the time, Connecticut state minimum wage was set at $8.70.

From May 2012 to May 2014, Zelepos reportedly failed to pay employees properly for their overtime work, paid employees in cash, and worked employees more than 93 hours per week.

NBC reports that Zelepos is being ordered by the DOL to pay a total of $105,165.94 in back pay as well as $23,400 in civil penalties.

Zelepos is providing the DOL with payroll checks of the 110 employees ranging from $30 to more than $15,000, according to NBC.

Gary K. Pechie, Wage and Workplace Standards director, said in a statement that similar situations occur 'far too often.'

Pechi stated: 'Every employee deserves to be paid the required amount for the work that they do, and this is a flagrant example of an employer taking advantage of their workforce.

'We encourage any individual who believes they have not been paid properly for hours worked to file a complaint with the Labor Department.'

NBC reports that the DOL is now investigating a claim that one employee was fired after trying to report wage violations to the DOL.

Mystic Pizza, located in Connecticut, has been open since 1973, but became popularized by the 1988 film 'Mystic Pizza' starring Julia Roberts and Annabeth Gish. 

The film was named after the Connecticut restaurant caught the eye of the film's screenwriter, Amy Holden Jones.
