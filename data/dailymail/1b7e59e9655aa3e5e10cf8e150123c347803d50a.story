An 18-year-old black student who was shot to death by an off-duty St Louis police officer had gunshot residue on his hands, jeans and T-shirt, laboratory results have revealed. 

Vonderrit Myers was gunned down by the unidentified 32-year-old in Shaw, Missouri, last week, less than 10 miles from where unarmed teenager Michael Brown was killed by a cop in August.

Police previously said that Myers had fired at least three times at the off-duty officer, who was working with a security company at the time, and that his weapon was recovered at the scene.

Results: The 18-year-old  (left and right) had gunshot residue on his hands, jeans and T-shirt at the time of his death, laboratory results have revealed. Police previously said he shot the officer at least three times

In a statement, the St Louis Metropolitan Police Department said the presence of residue on a person's hands or clothes could mean they fired a gun or were near a gun when it went off.

However, it added the test results showed levels of residue that are consistent with Myers having been the shooter, because the off-duty officer was standing too far away, STL Today reported.

Relatives and friends of Myers have argued the high school student did not have a gun at the time.

It comes as demonstrations over the deadly August 9 shooting of Brown, who was also black, by officer Darren Wilson in the St Louis suburb of Ferguson have intensified.

More than 50 protesters were arrested in the city and its suburbs on Monday as hundreds of people staged acts of civil disobedience to draw national attention to race discrimination in policing.

The protests were peaceful and the activists mostly got themselves arrested as a symbolic act.

The demonstrators were calling for the arrest and indictment of Wilson. A grand jury is considering the evidence from that shooting and it is unknown when they will reach a conclusion.

Protesters who traveled from across the country for four days of protests that ended on Monday said they did not trust the police version of events in shootings in general, citing studies showing young black men are the most likely demographic to be shot by police.

On Tuesday afternoon, Myers' mother, Syreeta Myers, visited a makeshift memorial to her son in the Shaw neighborhood where he was shot, and cried.

St. Louis police union leaders held a news conference on Tuesday to present the gunshot residue findings, saying they wanted to get facts out before the public, the St Louis Post-Dispatch reported.

'We're done, as a police union, standing in the shadows in these cases,' said Jeff Roorda, business manager of the St. Louis Police Officer's Association, according to the Post-Dispatch.

'We are actively defending the officer involved in the shooting.'
