Chelsea midfielder Willian has spoken of his desire to score more goals, admitting that it is something manager Jose Mourinho has asked him to improve.

The 26-year-old joined Chelsea in August 2013, but has only scored five goals in his 56 appearances so far.

Speaking to Chelsea FC Magazine, he said: 'One thing I have in my mind is to score more goals - I am desperate. Mr Mourinho has told me this before. He knows, and I know, that I should get more goals.

'I'm very happy with my all-round game and my form so far this season, but I'll be a lot happier if I am scoring more goals. That would be good for the team as well.'

Having arrived in London from stints in the Ukrainian and Russian top divisions at Shakhtar Donetsk and Anzhi respectively, the Brazilian admits that he was expecting the drastic change of pace the Premier League involves.

'(The intensity) was something I was prepared for when I signed for Chelsea because I could see in the games I watched on television just how intense the matches are in this country. 

'I knew I needed to be ready to put in a lot hard work. If I was going to hold a place in the team, then I would have to run my heart out in every single match I play.'

Willian has impressed in his time at Stamford Bridge so far, and has appeared in 10 of Chelsea's 11 Premier League matches this season.

As with many Brazilians, Willian says he is 'feeling his vibe' at Chelsea... a happy-go-lucky personality, always smiling, always happy.

'I admit that I've always been a bit shy,' Willian continues. 'That's my character - I'm a shy guy - but when I'm with the guys here, I like to play games and joke around, especially with the other Brazilians.

'I'm feeling my vibe. I try to be happy at all times. I like to smile a lot and I always try to be happy, joking around and stuff.'
