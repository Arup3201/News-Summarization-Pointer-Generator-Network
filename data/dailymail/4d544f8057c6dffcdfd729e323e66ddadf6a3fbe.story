A besotted nurse tricked a man into thinking he had fathered a baby with her during a one-night stand.

Charmaine Wilson, 25, forged a birth certificate and faked a DNA test to convince Liam Griffiths of her deception in a ‘lie that snowballed out of control’.

Mr Griffiths, 31 was taken in by the lie and grew to love the boy he believed he had fathered her child during the one-off drunken encounter.

Charmaine Wilson said the lies 'snowballed out of control' and that she 'did not know how to stop it' 

He was even planning to build a home in his parents’ garden to support Wilson and the baby.

In fact, the two-year-old toddler belonged to one of Wilson’s friends – who also had no idea what she had been up to.

Mr Griffiths told the Daily Mirror: ‘The only word I can use to describe Charmaine and what she has done is mental and I cannot believe she would deceive me in this way.’

Wilson has now been jailed for four months after admitting two counts of fraud.

Web of lies: The nurse even convinced Mr Griffiths' parents that the toddler was their grandchild

The pack of lies – which went on for six months between December and May - were only exposed when a friend of Mr Griffiths, who knew the boy’s real parents, saw a photograph of the child with him on Facebook.

Mr Griffiths said: ‘I am devastated and heartbroken to have lost a child that I thought was my son and had bonded with this child.

‘We fell in love with him from the start and I am heartbroken to have lost him.’

Wilson, from Bridgend, south Wales, abused her position as a nurse at The Princess of Wales Hospital to forge documents when Mr Griffith raised doubts he was the dad.

She even convinced his parents the toddler was their grandchild and the family showered her with gifts – including a car to help her get to and from work.

Wilson, who has also been suspended by The Princess of Wales Hospital, was sentenced at Bridgend Magistrates’ Court yesterday.

The court heard how she met her victim on a night out in 2012 and they had sex after sharing a taxi home. But Mr Griffiths did not want to see her again after the one-night-stand.

Yet Wilson became obsessed and first lied to him that she had become pregnant but had had an abortion.

She stalked him on social media until he blocked her and he even had to change his telephone number.

But they did not meet again until Mr Griffiths was at The Princess of Wales Hospital last year to visit his dying grandfather.

Wilson took the baby to him and announced it was his.

Mr Griffiths’ mum Catherine Thomas, 54, said: ‘I cannot think of words to say about how awful it is that a human being could deceive another in this way and cause the hurt and upset it has done to our family.

‘We have spent an awful lot of money in accepting that he was our flesh and blood and this was given in good faith in us believing he was our grandson.’

She added: ‘I also think Wilson got lucky with her sentence if you ask me but at least she cannot hurt anyone where she is going, we all have a lot of healing to do.’

Steven Jones, defending Wilson in court, said she had told police she could not control the lies.

She told officers: ‘It was a lie that snowballed out of control and I did not know how to stop it.’

Wilson was also given a restraining order preventing her from approaching Liam Griffiths or his family in future.
