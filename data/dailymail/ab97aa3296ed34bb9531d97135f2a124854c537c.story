A CVS customer was stuck in a Missouri store Sunday evening after it shut down with her still inside.

Alyssa DeGraff, of Kansas City, went to a south Kansas City pharmacy around 9:45pm to buy gummy vitamins, KCTV reported.

'My life is so strange, only this would happen to me,' DeGraff said in an interview with the affiliate station, revealing that she 'Kind of took my time meandering the store for a while. I was there for about 30 minutes.'

She headed to the register at approximately 10:15pm, KCTV reported.

'There's nobody at the cash register and so I start looking around the store, I can't find anybody, I start calling out and then I walk up front and see the garage door is pulled down,' she told the affiliate station.

She also explained 'I started panicking when I realized my phone was at four per cent because I wasn't sure who to call first.'

DeGraff dialed 911 after she could not successfully get in touch with the CVS corporate offices, KCTV reported.

While inside the store, DeGraff took a selfie showing her standing in front of the locked front entrance and posted it to Instagram. 

The caption said, 'Welcome to my ridiculous life I'm LOCKED IN CVS.'

Freed: Police along with two CVS managers got DeGraff out of the store at approximately 11:30pm Sunday 

She explained her decision to answer a phone inside the store, telling KCTV 'I'm going to answer this, what the heck, and it ended up being CVS general security alarm system that had been silently triggered by me.'

Police along with two CVS managers got DeGraff out of the store at approximately 11:30pm, the affiliate reported.

DeGraff was able to buy her gummy vitamins and filed a complaint with CVS, telling the news outlet, 'Honestly I think the whole thing is hilarious. I'm not that mad or upset.'

Police inquired about closing procedures at CVS, she also said, and the managers of the store offered no comment to KCTV.

The web page for the CVS branch DeGraff visited says the store is open from 8am to 10pm on Sundays.

The CVS store in question declined to comment to MailOnline for this story.
