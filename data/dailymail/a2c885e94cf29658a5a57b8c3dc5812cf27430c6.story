Five teenagers have been arrested after they were caught on camera running amok in a California grocery store in the middle of the afternoon last week

The four girls and one boy reportedly did not steal anything, but instead 'terrorized the store,' shouting gang slogans, dumping food into the aisles and at one point chugging a bottle of alcohol, Marysville police told KTXL.

After entering the Save Mart store around 1.40pm, the group prowled the shopping lanes screaming profanities and at one point dumped a bottle of cooking oil into the aisle that caused a 64-year-old veteran to slip and fall.

The shocking act of vandalism was allegedly carried out by the rampaging girls as revenge for the owners calling the cops on them two days earlier when they were causing a nuisance in the store.

Chugging along: Five teenagers were caught on camera causing chaos in a Marysville grocery store Wednesday afternoon

The 64-year-old Air Force veteran was taken to Rideout Medical Center with a potentially broken elbow.

The teenagers also apparently screamed and shouted gang slogans as they made their way through the aisles, according to police. 

'At one point they even went to the liquor aisle, and they actually opened up some liquor bottles and started consuming alcoholic beverages in the liquor aisle,' a police spokesman told KTXL.

Revenge: Investigators say they believe the teens were trying to get revenge on the store, where three of them had been arrested for shoplifting on Monday

Clearance: The group ripped groceries from aisles, dumping out a bottle of cooking oil that a 64-year-old Air Force veteran slipped and fell on

Trashed: Early estimates put the damage the teenagers caused at several thousands of dollars

When the store manager  attempted to intervene, one of the group members allegedly punched him in the face.

Two responding police officers at the scene received minor injuries when the 15-year-old boy reportedly resisted arrest.

One of the girls also tried to run and was apprehended after a brief chase.  

The five teenagers were taken to a juvenile detention facility on charges including felony vandalism.

Investigators say they believe the vandalism,  is estimated to have caused thousands of dollars in damages.
