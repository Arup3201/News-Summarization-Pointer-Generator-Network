Former England defender Danny Mills said Wednesday's draw with Ecuador showed why Roy Hodgson needed John Terry at the World Cup.

The Chelsea defender is likely to be in Brazil as a pundit for ITV after retiring from international football in 2012 in the aftermath of the Anton Ferdinand race row.

Experience: Dany Mills says England could do with John Terry in Brazil

Hodgson resisted calls for him to try and entice Terry back into the England fold and that decision could backfire with a shortage of defensive options.

'John Terry doesn't look like a bad option now,’ Mills told BBC 5Live after England's 2-2 draw.

'Roy Hodgson is likely to say 'it was an experimental side, he was pleased with a few things and unhappy with a few things and we move on to the next game'.'

Struggle: England defender Chris Smalling was at fault for Ecuador's first goal

Phil Jones and Chris Smalling struggled in the heart of defence, while using James Milner at right back was exposed by Ecuador’s left winger Jefferson Montero.

Rickie Lambert, Ross Barkley and Alex Oxlaide-Chamberlain, before he went off injured, all took the chance to press their claims for a starting place.

Mills added: 'One or two players did okay. We have shown when England give the ball away, it is not good enough, we are not organised enough. You have to be ready to defend. I am not sure enough of the England players are aware of that.

'Ecuador have aspirations of getting out of their World Cup group with France, Honduras and Switzerland. There is no real favourite to get out of that group but they have shown they are a decent side here.'

Mills said England's Raheem Sterling was unfortunate to be sent off following a late clash with Antonio Valencia.

He said:

It was a rash challenge by Sterling. He 
dived in, didn't get the ball. The ref could possibly have booked him. 
Then Valencia pushes him in the head, went to grab his throat but 
changed his mind. A red card for both is unnecessary. A yellow would 
have done both of them.'
