Sir Roger Jones OBE, former chairman of Children in Need, who has said that predatory paedophile Jimmy Savile was banned because of his suspicious behaviour with children

Jimmy Savile was secretly banned from the BBC’s Children in Need appeal for being ‘creepy’.

Though still revered elsewhere at the corporation, the presenter was kept away from the annual fundraiser because of ‘rumours’ of his interest in young girls.

Sir Roger Jones, the former chairman of Children in Need, said: ‘We all recognised he was a creepy sort of character. We took the decision that we didn’t want him near the charity.’

Savile raised millions for good causes, so the revelation that he was barred from the BBC’s own flagship appeal suggests his unsavoury lifestyle was widely known.

Sir Roger, 69, who was a governor of BBC Wales at the time, said: ‘A guy with a big cigar in his mouth, a string vest who is covered in gold chains and trinkets – is this really the guy we want to become a hero for kids?

‘I had no evidence but I found his behaviour very strange. I felt it was inappropriate. I couldn’t tell that he was a practising paedophile – but I didn’t have to.

‘A charity like Children In Need knew the biggest thing to guard against was paedophiles – they were just like flies around the  honey pot.’

Savile appeared on the telethon in 1984, 1987 and 1989, before Sir Roger became chairman. A member of the board of governors between 1996 and 2002, Sir Roger said he would have stepped down from his charity role if Savile had become involved.

He added: ‘On my watch, Children in Need was properly covered. There were no incidents. We did everything we could to protect the children.

‘Not just in the fundraising but also in the distribution of funds. I mean, if we had given money to a paedophile group, the sky would have fallen on the BBC. So we were very, very careful. We were on red alert. The charity was very attractive to paedophiles. I used to receive phone calls from senior police officers saying, “Don’t go near that guy, that guy’s a baddie”.

‘We did everything we possibly could to protect the kids.’

The National Association for People Abused in Childhood is demanding an ‘on air’ apology during this year’s Children in Need appeal on November 16.

'Creepy': Jimmy Savile is believed to have molested more than 300 children over four decades of fame

Fundraiser: A Children in Need fundraiser in 1996, when Sir Roger was chairman. He said: 'We didn't want him near the charity'

Pete Saunders, chief executive of the charity, said: ‘I will be writing to the director-general George Entwistle next week, asking the BBC to help survivors of abuse because I think they owe it to them.’

Since dying aged 84 a year ago yesterday, Savile has been exposed as one of the country’s worst ever predatory paedophiles.

His great-niece – who revealed her grandmother knew he had abused her but said nothing – has been attacked on Facebook for speaking out about the TV star molesting her.

Caroline Robinson, 49, of Thoralby, North Yorkshire, became a target for relatives after claiming her late grandmother, Savile’s sister Marjorie Marsden, kept quiet to ‘preserve his fame’.

She claimed to have been molested twice by the age of 15 – but after talking publicly she has been accused of lying and bringing shame on her family, which has led her to report relatives to police.

Yesterday Savile’s official biographer declared herself ‘utterly devastated’ by his betrayal.

Alison Bellamy, who wrote How’s About That, Then? said Savile has gone from ‘childhood hero to monster’, adding: ‘Thinking back, he littered his words with phrases that I now see in a new light. I would laugh when he would say, unprompted, things like: “She said she was over 16, boss, honest.”

‘Maybe he felt guilty? Maybe he didn’t.’

÷ A former royal aide has told how Savile would run his lips up the arms of young female assistants while visiting St James’s Palace.

Dickie Arbiter, spokesman for the Queen for more than a decade, said the DJ exhibited behaviour that was a cause for ‘concern’ during regular visits to see Prince Charles.

‘I remember calling him an old reprobate and he said “not so much of the old”,’ said Mr Arbiter.

Individual allegations were not collated, says Mr Hogan-Howe

Abuse allegations made against Jimmy Savile while he was alive could have been linked to show 'a pattern of behaviour', Scotland Yard's commissioner said today.

Bernard Hogan-Howe said police and other organisations had not 'put together' claims made against the disgraced television presenter.

Members of the public may also have been discouraged from taking action because of Savile's reputation at the time, he said.

The commissioner told reporters: 'You might have thought that people would at least have talked about it and intervened.

'It does look as if from time to time people have been concerned, they've made the start to intervene, but probably then they've relied a little bit too much on his reputation and his word that he did nothing.

'If you accept all the public accounts of the activity then it's possibly spanned 50 years which is a huge amount of time.

'First of all within an organisation that's got everybody's respect, but probably it appears that people haven't intervened when they've had suspicions.

'Then of course other organisations including the police have had individual allegations that have not been put together to actually show that this person may well have shown a pattern of behaviour that's been pretty awful.'

Four police forces were contacted by seven potential victims while Savile was alive. Surrey, Sussex and Jersey all found that there was not enough evidence to proceed.

Mr Hogan-Howe said a lot of what happened was before changes were made to the sharing of police data following the murders of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman.

A team of 30 officers are currently investigating three categories of allegations: those involving Savile, those involving Savile and others, and those involving others.

The commissioner said that most of the 'others' are involved in the entertainment industry.
