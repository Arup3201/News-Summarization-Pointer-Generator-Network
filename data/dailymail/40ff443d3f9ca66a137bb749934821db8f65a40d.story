The first indication anything was wrong with Bobby-Jo Potts during her sleepover at her grandparents’ house was when she said: ‘Nana, I’ve got a bad head.’

Her father was called round to check on her, and within minutes the eight-year-old was severely unwell and was vomiting.

Just a few hours later the gymnastics-loving schoolgirl, who had never before been ill, died in hospital after suffering a brain haemorrhage.

Bobby-Jo’s parents, Julie and Steve, both 43, had sent her round to stay the night with her grandparents around the corner from their home in West Denton, Newcastle.

She had enjoyed her favourite tea of mince and dumplings and watched gymnastics on TV before complaining that she felt unwell.

Her grandmother, Pat Beattie, 66, said: ‘She was sat there and she said, “Nana I’ve got a bad head” and everything went haywire from there.’

An ambulance was called to take her to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle but her heart stopped a number of times on the way to hospital.

Doctors discovered Bobby-Jo had  suffered a ruptured aneurysm at the back of her brain. They fought to save her life for two hours but their efforts were in vain.

Her father said: ‘The doctors said it could have happened at any time. It was horrendous, absolutely horrendous. The only small bit of comfort was that she was with people she loved.

‘I think she’s in the house all the time because I can feel her here. She always had a smile on her face. I used to pick her up from school and could tell straight away by looking at her face when she came through the doors what mood she was in.’

Her mother added: ‘Everything used to amuse her, she was always laughing and now the house is just dead without her.’

Describing the November 8 tragedy, the schoolgirl’s grandmother said: ‘It just seemed to happen within a split second.

‘It’s been so quiet round here since it happened. She knew everyone and was always out playing, but it’s been deserted on the estate.

‘She used to come to our house all the time and every time she would write little notes saying “Love you Nana”.’

Mourners at her funeral today have been asked to wear her favourite colour, pink, as a tribute.
