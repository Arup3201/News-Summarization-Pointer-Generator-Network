Parents who continue to cook for children who have grown up or left home have been blamed for fuelling Britain’s food waste crisis.

Dubbed ‘hotel parents’, mothers and fathers whose children treat their home ‘like a hotel’ routinely cook dinner for them only for it to end up in the bin, a parliamentary inquiry has been told.

It comes as ministers accuse the public of ‘ignorance’ about best before dates and what to do with leftovers.

Binned: Many meals end up being thrown away because parents have cooked for children who do not come home for dinner, a council has claimed

Every year families in the UK throw away 7.2million of food, including spending £12billion on food which could have been eaten but ends up in the bin.

Households are responsible for half of all the food waste every year, according to official figures.

In the past officials have blamed supermarkets for buy-one-get-one-free offers to encourage people to buy too much food, or confusing use by dates which mean perfectly edible food is thrown away.

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson told MPs: ‘The fact is it is shocking really in this day and age that good food is thrown away, partly out of ignorance and party out of aesthetics.

'We throw away an appalling amount of food away, it's 15million tonnes-a-year.

'One of my enthusiasm is to see that it doesn’t go to land fill but is processed in some way.’

Mr Paterson is backing anaerobic digestion, which used food or farm waste to generate heat or electric power.

But a House of Lords inquiry into food waste has been told that parents struggling to adjust to their children leaving home, or seeking independence, are also adding to the problem.

New figures yesterday showed a sharp rise in the number of homes with more than one 
family living as the ‘boomerang 
generation’ of young people comes back to live with their parents.

Shropshire Council told peers that many too much food is wasted because parents still cook meals for children who have grown up.

‘There are so called “hotel parents”, those with older children who treat their homes like a hotel,' it said.

‘These parents often have to deal with fluctuating household numbers that make planning meals difficult,’ the Lords EU subcommittee on Agriculture, Fisheries, Environment and Energy was told.

‘Empty nesters also have difficulty adjusting to fewer people being at home for meals and still cook the same size portions, as do those who sadly have to adjust to bereavement.’

With house prices rising and the 
under-30s unable to afford a home in large parts of the country, many 
even with partners and children are forced to move in with the in-laws.

There are now 286,000 multi-family households in the UK, up from 193,000 in 2006. Analysts say they are the fastest-growing household type, rising by 40 per cent in a decade.

Shropshire council added that people who do not write a shopping list before leaving the house also buy too much, or the wrong food, while most people routinely cook too much rice or pasta.

It said its claims were based on 'thousands of conversations' with local people at public events, radio phone-ins and cookery demonstrations.

The warning is echoed by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs which claimed too few people know how to turn leftovers into an edible meal.

In evidence to the committee, Defra said:  ‘At household level, the main reasons for food waste are buying, cooking, preparing or serving too much: including not knowing what to do with leftovers and also food not used in time or that has gone past its use by date.’

The government’s Love Food Hate Waste is offering people recipes on how to turn excess food into a meal on the next day.

Tesco found that 68 per cent of its bagged salads, 48 per cent of its bakery goods and 24 per cent of its grapes go to waste

The National Farmers’ Union has also pointed to other countries working to teach people about cooking with leftovers.

Both the Austrian farmers’ women association and the German farmers’ association have backed campaigns making clear that some food is called ‘too good for the garbage bin’.

Last week Tesco admitted up to two thirds of supermarket food ends up in the bin.

The retail giant found that 68 per cent of its bagged salads, 48 per cent of its bakery goods and 24 per cent of its grapes go to waste.

Much of the food is thrown away by customers – but large amounts are lost because they have been on display too long. Yet more produce has to be ditched before it even reaches shelves.
