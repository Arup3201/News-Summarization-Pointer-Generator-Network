Surrounded by thousands of well-wishers, the widow of Herve Gourdel clutched a single white rose as she openly cried at a gathering in tribute to her husband who was murdered by Islamic extremists.

Mr Gourdel's wife, Francoise, was with the mountaineer's parents today as thousands of people, including hundreds of Muslims, took to the streets of France to denounce the killing by Algerian Islamic extremist group Jund al-Khilifa - close allies of ISIS.

Many more Muslims gathered outside mosques in cities across France to condemn the barbaric murder of the 55-year-old father-of-two.

Thousands of people gathered in the southern French city of Nice for a silent walk, where flowers and pictures of the murdered man, were held aloft. 

Francoise and Mr Gourdel's parents, Jean and Genevieve, were visibly emotional as they lay flowers at the service.C

Candles were lit at a separate service in a square in Montpellier yesterday, as many more congregated in Paris and Nantes. 

A video of Mr Gourdel's brutal murder, titled 'A Message in Blood for the French Government', followed French airstrikes on ISIS targets in Syria.

President Francois Hollande has declared three days of national mourning but says France will not give in to 'blackmail' from terrorists. The flag atop the Grand Palais in France is being flown at half-mast.

Dalil Boubakeur, rector of the Grand Mosque of Paris, spoke to a crowd of people mainly of North African origin in the French capital, saying: '[Mr Gourdel] was the victim of a cowardly murder. 

'Islam demands respect for life. The Koran tells us that to kill one man is to kill all humanity.'

Gone but not forgotten: Today's march saw hundreds of flowers and pictures of Mr Gourdel left as a tribute to the man, who leaves behind two grown-up children

The video of Mr Gourdel, a tour guide who was visiting Algeria, shows the man kneeling with his arms tied behind his back before four masked militants.

Frenchman Herve Gourdel was a qualified mountain guide.

The 55-year-old spent years training other guides in Nepal, Morocco and Jordan, and had visited Algeria before.

He lived with his wife, Francoise, in Nice, and had two grown-up children.

Mr Gourdel was abducted by the Jund al-Khilifa Islamic extremist group on September 21 - just one day after arriving in Algeria for a 10-day walking holiday.

Three days later, the video of his death was posted online.

Like previous beheadings by ISIS fanatic 'Jihadi John' in Syria, who has killed two American journalists, as well as British aid worker Alan Henning, the beheading is not shown but the grim aftermath is.

The video, released just 30 minutes after Barack Obama's used a speech at the UN urging the world to dismantle ISIS' 'network of death', sent shockwaves through France, with public support for military intervention against ISIS rocketing to 69 per cent following Mr Gourdel's murder. 

France's five-million-strong Muslim population is the largest in Europe. Some on the French right have suggested the Islamic community has not condemned Mr Gourdel's murder strongly enough.

This claim was strongly rejected by its leaders, and was rebutted by the rally in Paris and others across the nation today and yesterday. 

Dozens of Algerians were among the hundreds outside the Grand Mosque, and more gathered in the cities of Nantes, Montpellier and Bordeaux.  

'This is not Islam, what they are doing,' Mohamed Benbouzia, an elderly Parisian man of Algerian origin said.

'It is a perversion, by sick people, murderers, criminals, people who should be sitting in jail.

'The Algerian government must do absolutely everything it can to track down the people who did this and bring them to justice.'

Enes Mustafic, 65, said: 'Nowhere does the Quran say other religions or nations must be attacked. Cutting people's heads off is really the most despicable. If airstrikes can stop these fundamentalist, aggressive ideas from spreading, I am all for it.' 

A service in Montpellier saw hundreds of people gather at the Comedy Square to light candles in the mountaineer's honour, southern France

Candles were lit around a message reading 'Goodbye Herve' during the gathering, which takes place on the second of three days of national mourning across France

Hundreds of Muslims gathered at the Great Mosque in Paris yesterday to pay  tribute to Mr Gourdel. Prominent French Muslims have lent their voice to protests by Muslims in several countries against the campaign of terror waged by ISIS and their allies

Muslims waved Algerian and French flags outside the mosque after Friday prayers, as people protested against barbaric extremist group ISIS

Mourning: The flag at the Grand Palais, Paris, has been at half-mast since Mr Gourdel's death, which was revealed in the video titled 'A Message in Blood for the French Government' by Jund al-Khilifa

The video shows French text, which translates to English as  'BLOOD MESSAGE FOR THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT'.

It then shows Gourdel kneeling with his arms tied behind his back before four masked militants. Two have assault rifles.

Gourdel appears to have a gash on the front of his throat. He appears calm.

One of the men, reading from a script, says: 

'Here is criminal France that is full of hatred for Muslims, coming to us with a new dress. The aggression on the Muslims in Mali was not enough for it, and before that in Algeria, where it destroyed and sowed corruption in the land, violated honor, fought whoever converted to Islam with its laws, prevented the hijab, spread vice and corruption, and killed the Muslims and displaced the weak.

'And today it refused to see the Shariah of Allah be applied in the land, the implementation of proscribed punishments, and the religion be spread.

'So it came with its horses and men to participate in this Crusader war under the pretext of terrorism, as they allege.' 

'Let the French people know that their blood is cheap for their president, and it is the same as you made the blood of the Muslim women and children cheap in Iraq and Sham [Syria] and other countries.

'Your blood has been cheapened as an exact recompense.'

The militants then push the victim on his side and hold him down. The video does not show the beheading, but a militant holds the head up to the camera afterwards.

Just before the militants gave their statement, the Frenchman briefly addressed his family. 

Zohra Lamloum, a French teacher of Algerian origin at a high school in a Paris suburb, said she was 10 years older than Gourdel and felt like he was her 'younger brother'.

Holding up a newspaper and pointing at a photograph of Gourdel, she said: 'He was a healthy man, somebody who went hiking, who lived cleanly, who went to our country with the purest intentions, and this is what happened to him.

'The people who did this are drug addicts, imbeciles, they have no heart.'

The rector of Bordeaux's largest mosque, Tareq Oubrou, said French Muslims need not demonstrate in the name of their religion because ISIS is not representative of Islam. 

The hashtag #pasenmonnom - meaning 'not in my name' - trended on Twitter, as Muslims tweeted their support for the gatherings across the country.  

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said on Thursday his country had received 'credible' intelligence that Islamic State militants planned to attack subway systems in Paris and in the United States.

U.S. and French officials said then that they had no evidence to back up the prime minister's warning.

French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said on Friday there had been no confirmation of the Iraqi information about possible attacks on the Paris subway system by Islamic State militants.
