From promising starlets to Hollywood veterans, Oprah's O magazine is celebrating a whole host of stylish women aged between 17 and 100 for its 'Age Brilliantly' June issue.

The eclectic fleet of women appear in a summery, floral themed fashion spread to discuss their signature styles and how they find clothing that best suits their years.

Flamboyant Disney star Zendaya Coleman, 17, comes in as the youngest to feature, with 28-year-old Two Broke Girls co-star Beth Behrs, NBC Believe's Jamie Chung, 31, and iconic actress Tippi Hedren, 84, of Alfred Hitchock's The Birds, also appearing, amongst others.

Zendaya - the young singer-actress who made a name for herself starring in Disney's Shake It Up and is now promoting her new movie, Zapped - looks fresh in an electric blue sweater matched with tie-dye pants and a large fedora.

'A lot of my fashion inspiration comes from my friends or random people on Instagram,' Zendaya says. 'Nothing matches or makes sense, but it works because they have confidence in their look.'

The starlet, who wrote a book last year entitled Between U and Me, aimed at giving advice and inspiration to young teens, also appears in another lively shot for the spread, smiling broadly as she sits cross legged on the floor with sky-high blue stilettos.

Beth Behers, 28, may play a penny-pincher on her hit series Two Broke Girls, but her outfit looks anything but cheap.

The tousled haired blonde actress stuns in a colorful graphic print dress and yellow polkadot jacket, and names Blake Lively as her biggest style crush.

'She’s classic, chic and comfortable in her own skin,' Ms Behers explains.

Slinky stunner: Former reality TV star Jamie Chung, 31, pictured, is a floral delight, her jacket open to reveal her taut tummy

Former reality TV star Jamie Chung, 31, who subsequently appeared in Sucker Punch and The Hangover series, is long and lean in a pretty floral skirt suit, the jacket unbuttoned to reveal her toned midriff and an elegant bra.

Ms Chung, recently engaged to actor Bryan Greenberg, is currently starring in NBC's Believe and is based in New York city.

Daisy Fuentes, 47, is the TV host best known for becoming both MTV’s first Latina VJ and also Revlon's first Latina spokesperson to win a worldwide contract.

Award winner: Melissa Leo, 53, who won an Oscar for her supporting role in The Fighter, sports a classic cream sleeveless jacket, paired with a modern geometric skirt

Ms Fuentes, who has a hugely successful clothing line at Kohl’s, looks a curvy delight in the spread, sporting a form-hugging blue printed skirt and nude camisole.

When the Spanish-based beauty was asked to name her biggest fashion regret, she said: 'A black dress that I wore to an MTV awards show that was both embellished and sheer. You could see half my ass.'

Melissa Leo, 53, a New York-native and winner of an Academy Award for her supporting role in The Fighter, shows off a cream sleeveless jacket and a blue geometric skirt, her auburn hair rolling free off her shoulders.

Pure grace: Tippi Hedren, 84, star of Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds and 
huge fan of fashion label Bebe, is a picture of refined elegance, but 
for the slightly scary gold talons

Jessica Walter, 73-year-old Arrested Development star and voice of FX's animated series, Archer, looks polished in a white pant suit with a pink jacket, accessorized with a large rose gold pendant. The Brooklyn-born actress is currently a development executive for ABC Family.

Last but not least, Tippi Hedren, 84, the actress best known for her performance in Alfred Hitchcock's classic hit, The Birds, is perfectly poised in a nude and white skirt suit - straight cut, she says, because she's 'short' - with metallic silver heels.

Ms Hedren, a staunch animal rights activist, discussed her love for the fashion label Bebe. 'I found this really wonderful jacket at Bebe that’s black and short and faux leather,' she says. 'Every time I wear it, someone wants to steal it from me.'

Other women to appear in the spread include 61-year-old Beverly Johnson, the first African American woman to grace the cover of Vogue and 100-year-old Agnes Zhelesnik, the oldest working teacher in the U.S.

The June issue of O magazine hits newsstands May 13.
