Big business: Spending an average of £5 a bag, party bags now cost parents £808 million 

Forget a home-made cake and a few balloons, children's birthdays are now big business, with parents feeling serious pressure to outdo each other with lavish parties and gifts.

Across the nation mothers are collectively spending up to £808 million on the traditional party bag gesture.

It's no secret that parents feel a level of competitiveness to surpass each other when it comes to who does it best, and this research shows that the party bag is playing a big part in the competition. 

Mothers spend as much as £5 on each bag and children invite, on average, 21 friends. This equates to a sizeable spend of £105 per party – just to keep their place in the league of best party hosts, as rated by parents in the playground. 

In fact, so big is the trend to make birthdays an occasion to remember that generous mothers are also spending as much as £355 on gifts, cakes, party entertainment and a family day out.

The study, carried out with 2,000 mothers to mark the launch of a new campaign by charity World Bicycle Relief UK, found almost half (43 per cent) of mothers admit they feel social pressure to spend a lot of money on their child's birthday even though it didn't necessarily increase the enjoyment of the occasion for the child. 

Almost all of the mothers questioned (80 per cent) said they found the grand gestures on birthdays left them feeling regretful. Two thirds (66 per cent) of mothers admitted to unnecessarily exceeding their budget every year.

In light of the findings, World Bicycle Relief UK is launching a campaign to encourage mothers to make a change and swap the spend on party bags for a more meaningful gesture.

The 'Bag a Bike' campaign is urging parents to forego the contents of the traditional party bag and swap novelty hair clips and loom bands for a charitable donation. 

To help mothers do this, World Bicycle Relief UK has set up a party tool kit on its website, which includes downloadable cards that mothers can give with a piece of cake that guests can still take home, explaining how their party bag is helping others.

World Bicycle Relief UK provides school children, (70 per cent girls) living in poor areas of Africa with robust bicycles that give them access to education, healthcare and better opportunities. With £95, they can buy a bicycle for a child, which will enable them to attend school on a daily basis. 

Generous mothers are also spending as much as £355 on gifts, cakes, entertainment and a family day out

This specially designed bicycle can withstand the tough terrain that faces them when they make the journey to school - which can be up to three hours long.

Swapping party bags for a donation is a simple way that a family in the UK can change the life of a schoolchild growing up in some of Africa's poorest regions. Over a quarter (26 per cent) of mothers said their offspring would be happy to help children less fortunate than themselves if they knew more about others' needs.

Stephen Cromwell, World Bicycle Relief UK Development Director, said: 'The findings from our report show that there is a fantastic opportunity to use the generous spirit of British families to change the lives of those less fortunate.

'Access to education and healthcare is a given for children in the UK, but in rural parts of Africa it can take children more than three hours of walking, on an unforgiving terrain, just to get to school.

'Supplying durable bicycles mobilises these young children, giving them the chance to build a future. Our campaign is encouraging parents to think differently about the traditional party bag and introduce an alternative gesture, which could completely change the life of a school child in Africa.' 

UK mothers are increasingly turning to social media for advice. Research released today by Philips Avent has found that over a third (33 per cent) say social media and forums make parenting that little bit easier and 35 per cent of British mothers say they turn to apps over loved ones for guidance.

Almost eight in ten (79 per cent) of British mothers find modern technology a life saver when it comes to parenting with 15 per cent admitting that Skype makes parenthood more stress-free as they can keep in touch with family members and friends across the globe. 

More than six in ten (63 per cent) say Facebook is very useful to them when it comes to getting advice from friends and family.

As well as using technology for parental assistance, mums are also using it to keep others up to date on their children. The average UK mum admits to uploading nine pictures of their children per week onto social media. Most say they do this to keep their family and friends updated on their child's progress. However, a quarter admit they upload images just to brag about their child's accomplishments. Brighton residents are the worst offenders with almost half saying they only upload photos of their children to brag followed by those in Nottingham.
