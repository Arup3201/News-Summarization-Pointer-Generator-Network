Oregon State Police acting on a tip tracked down a wanted murder suspect who was arrested Wednesday wearing nothing but a loin cloth and a crown of twigs. 

Lt. Gregg Hastings said 44-year-old Daniel Martinson, a suspect in the November 2013 murder of 39-year-old Aaron Clouser, was taken into custody at a Cave Junction park without incident.

Police said last week that Martinson gave law enforcement officers the slip on a motorcycle during a manhunt in the forests near the California state line.

Martinson is accused of stabbing to death his acquaintance Aaron Clouser, whose lifeless body was discovered in the middle of a street in Cave Junction November 5, 2013, according to the station KPTV.

 

Police have not released a possible motive behind the killing.

Once Martinson was named a suspect, state police detectives went to work handing out pictures of the wanted man and asking local residents to keep an eye out for the 44-year-old. 

He was described as 5-foot-6 and weighing 155lbs, with a shaved head, a missing front tooth and a distinctive pit bull tattoo on his back above the word 'outlaw.'

The efforts of the investigators finally paid off Wednesday when a Good Samaritan called 911 just after 9am to report that he spotted Martinson in Cave Junction and recognized him.

The man was seen carrying a box filled with supplies from a food bank on South Junction Avenue.

About 10 minutes later, detectives converged on Jubilee Park and arrested Martinson, who was found barefoot with a piece of yellow cloth tied around his waist and a crown of green branches on his head.

‘It sounds like he was just tired of running,’ Lt Hastings told Statesman Journal.

At the height of the manhunt for Martinson last week, one of his friends created a Facebook page in support of the murder suspect.

‘Daniel Martinson Is not a cold blooded murder [sic]!’ a status update from last Thursday stated.  ‘This man has a huge heart and often helped out those less fortunate than him.’
