Rugby player: Toby Hearne suffered catastrophic chest injuries and died at the scene in Stanton St Quintin, near Chippenham, Wiltshire, last December

A teenager walking home from a party in a quiet village a few days before Christmas was killed when he lay down in front of his friend’s car and was run over, an inquest was told today.

Toby Hearne, who had celebrated his 17th birthday the previous day, suffered major chest injuries and died at the scene in Stanton St Quintin, near Chippenham, Wiltshire, last year.

Youcef Adjerid, 18, a friend of Toby’s who was the driver of the Fiat Punto, was not to blame for the accident as he was unaware the 17-year-old had lain down in front of him, the inquest heard.

Toby, a rugby player who had been at the party dressed as a Christmas present, had a blood alcohol level of 159mg per 100ml of blood - double the legal drink drive limit of 80mg/100ml.

Several of Toby’s friends told the Trowbridge inquest that they had met up at Hal Bailey’s home before walking the short distance to the party, hosted by local villager James Melvin.

Youcef, who had only passed his driving test two weeks earlier, had been working that night and arrived late at the party - just 15 minutes before it ended at midnight.

He was giving Scott Laing and another teenager a lift back to Chippenham. Toby and Hal, with friends Sam Riley and Joe Bodman, both 18, decided to walk the three-minute journey back to Hal’s house, where they were all staying.

As they walked along the lane, Youcef drove up behind them and stopped. Sam and Toby decided to climb on to the bonnet of Youcef’s car and take it in turns to ‘car surf’ as he drove at walking pace.

Joe told the hearing: ‘Sam and Toby were both on the bonnet of Youcef’s car and Youcef drove and Sam fell off and Toby got off. Youcef drove off and so we carried on walking along the road.’

A minute later, Toby and his friends 
caught up with the Fiat again as Scott had left his wallet at Hal’s 
house and wanted to collect it.

Incident scene: Kington Lane in Stanton St Quintin, near Chippenham, Wiltshire, where Toby Hearne died

The teenagers were talking to the occupants of the car when Toby lay down in the front of the car.

Ian Singleton, assistant deputy 
coroner for Wiltshire and Swindon, recorded a verdict of accidental 
death, saying Toby’s judgment had been impaired by the amount of alcohol
he had consumed.

‘We heard 
from the pathologist that the toxicology revealed a level of alcohol 
that was nearly twice the drink drive limit,’ Mr Singleton said.

‘We heard from a number of witnesses that Toby was in high spirits and was as drunk if not more as in previous occasions.

‘He
was walking unaided and committed various acts, such as falling over 
deliberately and riding on the bonnet of a car without causing himself 
any apparent injury.

‘I 
heard evidence from one of the group outside the car, who had a clear 
view, that without warning or comment Toby lay down in front of the car 
while the driver was talking to other members of the group.

‘Before
the witness had a chance to say or do anything the driver moved off 
with the front wheels of the Fiat passing over Toby. Due to the shouting
of those from outside the car the vehicle quickly came to a halt.

‘There is no evidence to suggest that the driver was aware of Toby’s presence or deliberately drove over him.

‘I
note the conclusion reached in the collision investigation report that 
this was a tragic incident that occurred as a result of Toby placing 
himself on the ground in front of the car in such a position that the 
driver could not see him.

‘On
the balance of probabilities I find that Toby’s actions and assessment 
of risks that he was placing himself at were affected by the level of 
alcohol he had consumed impairing his critical judgment capability.

‘The
appropriate verdict would be of accidental death, which is not in any 
way to trivialise Toby’s death, but reflects the fact it came about as 
an unintended consequence of a deliberate act on his part.’

Hal, 18, said: ‘As I walked up towards my house and turned back, I saw him lying in front of the bonnet. I saw clearly what happened. I saw him lay down but no-one in the car had seen that he had gone to the floor. I thought he was joking about.

‘Youcef was talking to Sam at the driver’s window and I don’t think he had seen Toby lying on the floor as otherwise he wouldn’t have driven off.’

The teenager told the hearing he did not have a chance to shout and alert Youcef to the danger.

He said: ‘It happened so quickly. He went down and it was probably a second or two seconds before the car moved off. I think Toby may have been laughing as a joke but I don’t think he said anything.’

Sam told the inquest: ‘I think I said to Youcef “I think you’ve run Toby over” but I knew he had hit him and that’s when Youcef got out of the car. He was really shocked and didn’t believe it.

‘I bent down and touched his leg and tried talking to Toby but obviously there was no response.’

Youcef, who had not been drinking, told the inquest that he did not know Toby had lain down in front of his car and described the moments before the accident.

‘Hal walked past the car first and then Joe came towards the front of the car and started messing with the front windscreen wipers and then both came to the driver’s window,’ he said.

‘Sam walked behind the car and started doing something to the car but I can’t remember what. Joe walked off behind the car and that’s when I moved away.

‘It seemed as if we went over a bump in the road. That’s when I tried to reverse and Scott said not to reverse.

‘We heard shouts from outside the car and they came to the driver’s side of the car and told us what happened and told us to get out of the car.’

Road accident investigator Pc Alan Kyne, from Wiltshire Police, read to the inquest extracts from the report he had prepared.

He said there were no mechanical faults with the Fiat and speed was not a factor in the accident.

‘Sam Riley mounted the bonnet of the Fiat, which Youcef drove forward a short distance at low speed, at which Sam fell off the car but was uninjured,’ he said.

‘Toby also mounted the bonnet and travelled a short distance before climbing off the car. Having turned his vehicle around in the junction, Youcef stopped in the junction having seen his friends approaching on foot.

‘The group of young men reached the vehicle and there was a level of interaction around the vehicle, which could be considered as a distraction to the driver.

‘Toby then lay down in front of the Fiat in a position he could not be seen by Youcef. Unaware of Toby’s actions Youcef drove forward over Toby and immediately stopped, reversing slightly before coming to rest with Toby beneath the vehicle.

'I saw him lay down but no-one in the car had seen that he had gone to the floor. I thought he was joking about. Youcef was talking to Sam at the driver’s window and I don’t think he had seen Toby lying on the floor as otherwise he wouldn’t have driven off'

Hal Bailey, 18, friend of Toby Hearne

‘Toby suffered a significant injury to his chest, aggravated by his position beneath the vehicle. Sadly Toby died at the scene.’

A post mortem examination found that Toby had died from compression of the chest. Toby’s parents did not comment as they left the court.

In a statement released by police at the time of the teenager’s death, they said: ‘Toby was a great sportsman and a gifted child in all areas of his life. He enjoyed life and was full of fun.

‘He had a really wide circle of friends and was a generous, kind, sensitive, affectionate and gentle young man.

‘He had an inexplicable magnetism which attracted everyone to him. Toby has left a void in all our lives and in many more who knew him.

‘To sum Toby up in his own words on a tweet “... (I) Take everything as it comes. Sometimes things go my way and sometimes they don’t. Love music, love sport, love life”.’

Toby was a talented rugby player and played for Chippenham RFC in the under-18s side.
