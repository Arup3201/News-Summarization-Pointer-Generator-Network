Andy Carroll fully admits that he is not yet in a position to fully trust his body after a latest injury setback – but believes he is ahead of schedule and confident of retaining match fitness in December.

The £15million man, who has endured a spate of fitness problems during his time at Upton Park, turned an ankle in pre-season training and missed the Hammers’ impressive start to the Premier League season.

And Carroll revealed three separate specialists in the capital saw nothing wrong with the ankle before he sought more advice in America. It was there where they ordered an immediate operation.

‘Nothing was said, everything was all right. Then I was still thinking of the start of the season, there was no issue,’ he said. 

‘I’ve seen three specialists in London and everything was fine, so I continued training. Then I knew myself and my physios knew something wasn’t right.

‘I had that [the operation] immediately and he gave us a four-month timeframe. It's only been two months since so everything is going well. Running at this stage is earlier than expected.

‘At the minute I'm not 100 per cent so it's in the back of my mind when I'm running.’

Carroll – who was speaking at West Ham’s launch of their new members’ initiative ‘Club London’ - was rushed back into the first team last year because of manager Sam Allardyce’s lack of options up front, but believes he can be afforded more time now because of the signings made in the summer.

‘It’s harder being injured when it’s just come after the last injury. It’s a lot harder. I just try to focus on the positives,’ he added. 

‘There was a lot of talk about when I was going to be back and I probably rushed it a bit quicker than I should have. This time has been a lot better and the lads are doing well. I just need to take my time, really.

The West Ham striker hopes to repay the £15million that the club paid to sign him from Liverpool

‘They have put a lot of faith in me, paying a lot of money. I don’t feel I’ve let them down because obviously it’s an injury that I couldn’t have helped. I’ve done it in training and in a game. It’s an injury that I don’t want and obviously no-one at the club wants.’

West Ham have designs on establishing themselves as a top-six club when they move into the Olympic Stadium in 2016. That, Carroll asserts, is a picture Allardyce painted when he signed from Liverpool last year.

‘The way we are going the players we have signed and in future with the stadium, I don’t see why we can’t do that.

‘Before I signed I spoke to Sam and obviously he was telling me about the plans going forward.’ 

Carroll was talking at the launch of West Ham's new members' club - 'Club London' which offers fans the chance to experience what vice-chairman Karren Brady labelled as an 'unrivalled hospitality experience'.

Season ticket holders and members will soon be able to visit the new Reservation Centre at Westfield Stratford City to hand-pick their new seats at the Olympic Stadium.
