It is a sport that has come to symbolise Spain - but from this weekend it may come to represent political divisions in the country.

This weekend Catalonia becomes the first region on the Spanish mainland to ban bullfighting.

Barcelona's famous bullring El Monumental will host its final bullfight on Sunday evening in front of 20,000 spectators.

While some see this as a victory for animal rights activists, there are those who say the ban is politically motivated as the region strives for autonomy.

Jose Tomas, 36, the country's most popular matador, will perform at his favourite bullring, drawing to close almost 100 years of history in the impressive building.

Catalonia's regional government voted in July last year to ban bullfighting on the grounds it is outdated and cruel, in response to demands from animal rights activists.

Supporters of bullfighting accused 
Catalan nationalists of hijacking the anti-bullfighting campaign for 
political purposes, to highlight their independence from Madrid.

They
point out that other popular events involving bulls, called 
'correbous', still take place legally in Catalonia, one of 17 autonomous
regions in Spain.

And they hope to overturn the ban on bullfighting on constitutional grounds.

The historic vote was sparked when campaign group Prou! ('Enough!' in Catalan) collected 180,000 signatures calling for a ban in the north-eastern region.

Celebrities including Pamela Anderson and Ricky Gervais backed the bid to outlaw the practice.

The parliamentary debate was closely fought, with 68 votes for the ban, 55 against and nine abstentions.

The law comes into force on 1 January next year but Sunday's bullfight is the final one in the season scheduled at El Monumental - Catalonia's last functioning bullring.

Tickets for the event are selling for up to 3,500 euros on the black market on the internet.

bullfighting fan David Guillem said: 'It's a surreal feeling, I can't 
quite believe it. It's like the sensation you have when someone you know
dies and you can't quite accept it.'

El Monumental has been hosting bullfights for almost 100 years

In recent years El Monumental, inaugurated in 1914, held only around 15 bullfights a year out of 1,000 around Spain.

It was often half empty during bullfights, which are not popular with younger people in Catalonia.

By contrast Las Ventas bullring in Madrid often sells out its 25,000 capacity and holds 350 bullfights a year.

Discussions are still going on over the future of El Monumental, which could become a concert venue.

It has previously hosted concerts by groups including The Beatles and The Rolling Stones.

Animal rights campaigners hope the Catalonia ban will spark further campaigns around the country.

The Canary Islands, a Spanish archipelago off the north west coast of Africa, banned bullfighting in 1991, but it was never popular there.

Many supporters of bullfighting regard it as a deeply ingrained, integral part of their national cultures.

Rather
than a competitive sport, the bullfight is more of a ritual which is 
judged by aficionados based on artistic impression 
and command.

Ernest 
Hemingway said of it in his 1932 non-fiction book Death in the 
Afternoon: 'Bullfighting is the only art in which the artist is in 
danger of death and in which the degree of brilliance in the performance
is left to the fighter's honour.'

While
there is usually no doubt about the outcome, the bull is not viewed as a
sacrificial victimâ€”it is instead seen by the audience as a worthy 
adversary, deserving of respect in its own right.

On the other hand those
who oppose bullfighting maintain it is a 
cowardly, sadistic tradition of slowly torturing, humiliating and 
finally murdering a terrified, dying bull.

who
vomits blood, bellows in agony, and desperately seeks his escape amid 
pomp and pageantry of unashamed people who applaud when he finally 
collapses and then is killed.
