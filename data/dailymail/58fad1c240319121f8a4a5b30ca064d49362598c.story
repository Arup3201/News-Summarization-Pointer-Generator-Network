Celebrity chef Antony Worrall Thompson issued a grovelling apology yesterday after being caught shoplifting from Tesco.

He pledged to ‘seek the treatment that is clearly needed’ following a caution from police for sneaking out cheese and wine without paying.

Worrall Thompson, a father of four, stole from the store five times over the Christmas period before being confronted by security guards in front of shoppers.

Apology: Antony Worrall Thompson being driven by a friend after being exposed for shoplifting

The 60-year-old former star of Ready Steady Cook described the thefts as ‘stupid and irresponsible’ and said he was ‘devastated’ for the family and friends he had let down.

He also apologised to staff at the store in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, where he has shopped for many years.

Worrall Thompson, whose restaurant business went into administration three years ago, was filmed on the store’s cameras using the self-service checkout machines.

He was said to have been caught ordering blocks of cheese at the delicatessen counter and taking bottles of wine, but putting only some items through the scanner and walking out with the rest.

Security staff were said to have filmed him in the act several times so they could be certain that it was not a genuine mistake.

Worrall Thompson said yesterday: ‘I am
 so sorry for all my recent stupid and irresponsible actions.

'I am of 
course devastated for my family and friends, whom I’ve let down, and 
will seek the treatment that is clearly needed.

‘I am not the first, and I certainly 
won’t be the last person to do something without rhyme or reason – what 
went through my head, only time will tell.

'Of course, I must also 
apologise sincerely to Tesco, with whom I’m had a long and genuine 
working relationship, and to all the staff at the Henley branch, many of
 whom I’ve got to know over the years.

‘Once again, I am so sorry and hopefully in the future I can make amends.’

Last night, in a rambling interview, the chef admitted on one occasion he stole bread and two pack of discounted coleslaw.

On another occasion, he paid £180 for three crates of champagne and then stole £4 of goods.

He said he did not need the money and was comfortably well off, so could not fathom why he had stolen low-price and discounted items.

Worrall Thompson mulled over 
everything that could have pushed him to steal. He spoke of the stress 
of moving house, the death of two close friends, giving up smoking, 
anaemia, long working hours, his inability to relax, his age and 
dementia.

Over Christmas, he said, he had personally flambeed every Christmas pudding at his restaurant, which had left him exhausted.

He went on: ‘I hope I’m not going 
totally gaga in my old age. I have wondered if it’s something like that 
but I hope 60 is too young for something like Alzheimer’s.’

The former I’m A Celebrity ... Get Me Out Of Here! contestant described the moment he was approached by security guards. He said: ‘It was like a dream or a nightmare.

‘I went back to the office with them and I’d taken a newspaper, three onions and a sandwich that time.

‘I was just thinking over and over, 'Why, why, why, are you taking three onions?' I’d taken £6 of stuff and the rest of the bill came to about £30.’

Worrall Thompson was arrested on suspicion of theft and cautioned on Friday. He was taken to a police station and had his photograph and fingerprints taken, along with a DNA saliva sample.

Antony Worrall Thompson's company AWT was forced into administration

He was questioned about shoplifting on five occasions at the Tesco superstore between December 22 and January 6.

The total value of the goods taken was
 £70.68. To receive a formal caution from police, a suspect must admit 
guilt. He will not have a criminal record but his details will remain on
 police files.

Worrall Thompson’s previous connection
 with Tesco was as a judge in the supermarket’s competition to discover 
Britain’s best unknown cheese in 2003. It was won by Goat’s Caerphilly, 
from Ditcheat, near Shepton Mallet, Somerset.

Forced out: The former home of celebrity chef Antony Worrall Thompson, in Lower Shiplake, Henley

The chef lives with his third wife, Irish-born Jacinta ‘Jay’ Shiel, 46.

The once-booming AWT empire has been hit badly by the economic downturn.
 He put his chain of six restaurants, pubs and cafes into administration
 in February 2009, blaming his bank for being too cautious with credit.

But administrators said the business was ‘overstretched’ with debts of 
more than £800,000, papers from a meeting of creditors at Reading County
 Court showed.

He has since bought back and reopened the Greyhound, a gastropub in 
Oxfordshire, and the Windsor Larder, a delicatessen and cafe. The chef 
also used his own funds to keep open two restaurants, in Kew and 
Windsor.

Two years ago he quit his £1.6million home in Henley for a house in Cadmore End, near High Wycombe.

Antony Worrall Thompson has been a regular fixture on television cookery shows for more than a decade.

The
 chef, who was born in Stratford-Upon-Avon, grew up in a theatrical 
family. Both his parents were actors and he is the godson of Richard 
Burton, who was his father's understudy at the Royal Shakespeare 
Company.

Worrall 
Thompson, who said he comes from 'a posh sort of family, in a way', was 
sent away to boarding school at the age of three.

His parents split up at around the same time and he was 21 before he saw his father again.

Worrall Thompson appeared on ITV reality show I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here in 2003

He was 16 when a rugby accident left his face badly disfigured and he needed surgery to repair the damage.

A
 course in catering management was followed by a series of jobs learning
 his trade at various restaurants in Essex, much to the horror of his 
grandmother who refused to write to him because she could not bring 
herself to write the word Essex on the envelope.

He really shot to fame in the early 1980s when he opened a restaurant called Ménage à Trois in London's upmarket Knightsbridge.

The restaurant, which was patronised by the Princess of Wales, only served starters and puddings.

The
 boom in cookery programmes in the 1990s propelled him into a different 
league and he was soon making regular appearances on shows including 
Food and Drink, Ready Steady Cook and Saturday Kitchen.

He
 has also made appearances on Question Time, The Weakest Link and went 
into the jungle for I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!

But his career has not always run smoothly.

In
 2008, he apologised after mistakenly recommending a potentially fatal 
weed as part of a healthy living regime and a year later he was forced 
to put his restaurant company into administration.

The three-times married chef has spoken candidly in the past of the toll his restaurant career has had on his private life.

In 2003, he told the Observer: 'I've lost two wives to restaurants, and a fantastic Japanese American girl.

'I
 mean, some of it was my own fault - too much dabbling in other women. 
But it's like a drug: you finish work, you can't sleep because the 
adrenaline is rushing round, so you end up in a club. You're never at 
home. Things start to fall apart.'

Richard Madeley stood trial for shoplifting in a branch of Tesco but was cleared

A number of celebrities have been accused of petty theft despite in many cases having huge wealth.

In one of the most bizarre cases, Liverpool footballer Glen Johnson was given a £70 on-the-spot fine in 2007 after he and a friend allegedly tried to steal a toilet seat and other bathroom fittings from B&Q in Dartford, Kent.

Last autumn, Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea was challenged by Tesco staff after he allegedly ate a doughnut and tried to leave without paying for it.

The footballer, who earns £70,000 a week, said he intended to pay but wandered out when he realised he’d left his wallet in the car. Staff dropped the matter without calling police.

Richard Madeley found himself in a similar predicament in 1991, but this time the store decided to press charges.

He stood trial for shoplifting after staff in a Manchester branch of Tesco said they saw the This Morning presenter pushing trolleys of alcohol through the checkout without paying.

He denied the charges, claiming he was simply absent-minded and was later cleared.

In 2002, Winona Ryder was convicted of theft after a shoplifting spree in a Los Angeles department store.

The actress, who had a history of depression, was fined £12,000 and told to attend counselling.

And last year, actress Lindsay Lohan was sentenced to 360 hours community service for stealing a gold necklace from a jewellery store in the U.S.

Peaches Geldof has also been accused of shoplifting – although no prosecution has ever been brought.

In October last year she was reportedly caught stealing make-up from Boots, leading her to be banned from the store.

Several months before, staff in a retro clothing store in Bristol accused her of taking clothes – a claim her spokesman dismissed as ‘nonsense’.
