It seems troubled Paul Gascoigne is back on the straight and narrow - as he balances precariously on a ledge while cleaning the windows on his top floor flat.

A shirtless Gascoigne, 46 - who last month pleaded guilty to drunkenly assaulting a security guard at a railway station - climbed out of window to get to the dirt outside his apartment.

The former footballer is recovering at the fourth-floor flat in Bournemouth following the latest in a list of alcohol-related incidents.

An onlooker told the Mirror: 'It was 
an extraordinary display by Gazza. After recent events, you’d normally 
be worried seeing him on a narrow ledge 50ft in the air.

'But
it seems he’s been looking after himself and staying off the booze. He 
looked in really good shape and was ripped as though he’d been working 
out.

'Perhaps he should be thinking about getting a window cleaner and stick to less dangerous household chores, though.'

Dirty work: Paul Gascoigne decided to do some housework while recovering at his forth-floor apartment in Bournemouth

Gascoigne has battled alcoholism for 
many years, but looked much leaner and healthier than on previous occasions as he did the housework on Sunday

The former Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur star was arrested after police were called to Stevenage station in Hertfordshire at around 10.30pm on July 4.

Last month, he was fined £600 for one charge of assault and £400 for a drunk and disorderly charge.

His solicitor told magistrates he was making progress during one-to-one session at a rehabilitation centre near his home.
