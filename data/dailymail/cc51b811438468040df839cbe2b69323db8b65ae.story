Former President George W. Bush has had his left knee partially replaced â€” seven weeks after having the same procedure on his right knee.

Bush's spokesman Freddy Ford said the procedure on Bush's left knee took place Saturday at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.

Ford says the 68-year-old ex-president and his wife Laura were on their way back to Dallas on Monday morning.

Fort says this operation and the one May 24 were both outpatient procedures performed by the same doctor.

Ford says Bush is 'looking forward to getting back on his mountain bike in a few weeks.'

Bush, who was the nation's 43rd president from 2001 to 2009, is known as a fitness enthusiast.

He will be recovering in his Texas ranch, which appeared earlier this month in Architectural Digest.

George and Laura Bush retired to Dallas since the president's eight years in the White House and spend most of their time in the tiny prairie town of Crawford at the so-called Prairie Chapel Ranch.
