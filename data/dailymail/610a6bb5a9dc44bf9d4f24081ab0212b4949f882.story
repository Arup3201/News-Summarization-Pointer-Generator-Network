Tragic: Devon schoolgirl Izzy Dix was found dead by her mother at her home in Brixham on Tuesday

Friends of a teenager found hanged at home have claimed she was bullied on the controversial website Ask.fm.

Izzy Dix, 14, was discovered by her mother last Tuesday.

Friends have now made a poignant YouTube video blaming her death on the question-answer website.

The website, which has been at the centre of controversy over cyberbullying, has around 60 million users.

Izzy’s friends’ video calls on every student at her school in Brixham in Devon to shut their Ask.fm accounts to honour the teen.

The two minute four second video opens with photos of the tragic youngster and text on the screen blames her death on the social network.

It says: 'Izzy was only 14 years old when she took her own life because of bullies. She was always smiling, nobody knew her feelings, not even her best friends.

'The bullying took place on Ask.fm. Her best friends are trying to have the site shut down.

'Nobody deserves to feel the way Izzy did. She has the most caring and amazing family and friends who didn’t deserve to lose such an amazing girl.

'Please think before you speak. Nobody’s life should have to end this way. So stop bullying now. Save a life.

Sleep tight Isobella, you are free from pain, stress and tears.'Izzy was found last Tuesday and shocked classmates at Brixham Community College have been offered counselling.

Her friends have launched the Ask.fm campaign and are speaking out with the consent of their parents and Izzy’s mum Gabbi.

They say the bullying was motivated out of jealousy because Izzy was a 'beautiful' young girl who was predicted A* results.

Natalie Rushe, 14, said: 'We want to put the message out there for everyone to delete their Ask.fm accounts.

'We don’t want anything like this to ever happen again. It has affected so many people.'

Another friend Tia Budd, said:'Izzy didn’t answer any of the messages. But it wasn’t just Izzy, I have been bullied, so has Natalie and lots of other people.

'We knew she was upset but never knew it was this bad. We have deleted our accounts but there are still people taking the hate and it doesn’t need to happen. It’s a horrible website and it should be closed down, it’s gone too far.

'We are all much closer now, even people who didn’t know Izzy are devastated. There was not one student or teacher who wasn’t in tears when they found out.

'She was such a lovely girl and whenever you saw her she had a smile and had lots of friends.'

Prime Minister David Cameron has already slammed Ask.fm as ‘vile’ after it was linked to the death of 14-year-old Hannah Smith from Leicestershire.

Tragic: This note was taped to Izzy's door

Police and paramedics were called to Izzy’s home where they confirmed she was dead and they are not treating the death as suspicious.

On a memorial page set up in her memory on Facebook, some have suggested the schoolgirl had been bullied before she took her own life.

One of the 3,000 followers on the page wrote: 'I hope the bullies who brought this about are found and brought to justice.

My thoughts and prayers go out to Izzy’s family and friends. R.I.P little one.'

He added: 'Such a beautiful young girl, with everything to live for, so terrible that Izzy felt so alone and desperate to end her short life.'

Another added: ‘I hope the scum that made her do this feel guilty and ashamed.

'It’s just a shame that it’s taken her death for people to say nice things about her.

'My thoughts are with her family at this most tragic of times.

'No parent should have to bury their child. RIP Izzy. You’re safe now xxx.’

The schoolgirl, from Brixham, Devon, posted a picture on her own Facebook page last month with the cryptic message: 'Don’t cry because it’s over, smile because it happened.’

News of her death was broken to her classmates in assemblies at Brixham Community College on Wednesday morning, with counselling services offered to traumatised pupils.

Headmaster Mark Eager said: 'The death is a tragic loss, and the thoughts and prayers of the entire college community go out to the student’s family and loved ones.'

Tracey Darby, a parent, added on Facebook: 'My son Matt knew her and from his and all the comments on here it’s clear she was a very special girl.'

Devon and Cornwall Police said it is not treating the death as suspicious.

'Our investigation will be detailed and thorough,' he said.

'And we would ask people not to make judgments or opinions from what is being said on social media sites.'
