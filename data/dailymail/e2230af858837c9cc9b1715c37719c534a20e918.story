England were unable to make a major statement ahead of the World Cup next year and defeat the defending champion New Zealanders but they pushed the visitors to the last at Twickenham. 

While Stuart Lancaster's side got the better of the first half, taking a 14-11 lead to the break, the All Blacks' quality showed in the second half as they pulled ahead with a late converted try flattering the hosts on the scoreboard.

Sportsmail's Sam Peters was at Twickenham and rates the players' performances.   

Star man Richie McCaw celebrates his second-half try in New Zealand's win over England at Twickenham

ENGLAND 

Mike Brown - 6

Has not been in his best form for Harlequins but was excellent on Saturday apart from one scuffed clearance kick. A top-class international.

Semesa Rokoduguni (replaced by Anthony Watson 62) - 7

Targeted defensively by the All Blacks but looked composed and calm under pressure. Tackled superbly and marshalled Savea well.

Brad Barritt - 8

England’s unsung centre showed precisely why Lancaster and his coaches have so much faith in him. Defensively rock-solid and his floated pass set May clear.

Kyle Eastmond (George Ford 65) - 7

One charged down clearance kick almost led to All Black try but otherwise this was a promising performance from the rugby league convert.

Jonny May - 8

A try after three minutes which will live long in the memory for anyone who witnessed it. His best display in an England shirt.

Owen Farrell - 6

Finished the game with a blood streaming down his face. Total commitment but starved of second-half possession as New Zealand took charge.

Danny Care (Ben Youngs 62 mins) - 7

A couple of sharp jinking runs from England’s first-choice No9. Is forging a strong half-back partnership with Farrell which should take England to World Cup.

Joe Marler (Matt Mullan 55) - 7

Scrummaged well and tackled himself to a standstill. Few opportunities with ball in hand but a solid shift at the coalface.

Hartley (Rob Webber 73) - 7

Wound up opposite man Ben Coles to the extent of him lashing out and being sin binned. Terrific work rate and solid in the set piece.

Wilson (Kieran Brookes 73) - 7

Took a fearful hit from Sonny Bill Williams in first half but regained his composure and proceeded to make an impressive contribution.

Dave Attwood - 8

Only a third international start for the new dad but looked a seasoned campaigner. Dominant in the line out and superb in the loose.

Courtney Lawes (George Kruis 23) - 6

Full of endeavour but missed a vital tackle in lead up to first All Black try before departing with suspected concussion.

Tom Wood - 6

Typically high work-rate from one of England’s leaders and reasonably effective at the breakdown. Needs to carry more.

Chris Robshaw (c) - 7

Industrious and utterly committed but it was hard not to draw comparisons with opposite man McCaw. Should he play blindside?

Billy Vunipola (Ben Morgan 53 mins) - 7

A couple of frustrating turnovers but carried the ball with menace and caused dents in the All Black defence. Impressive work-rate.

NEW ZEALAND 

Israel Dagg - 6

Completely flat footed for May’s early try and not at his most effective with ball in hand. Still a threat even on quiet days.

Ben Smith - 7

Didn’t see a great deal of possession but one wonderful take from a high ball reminded us of his class. Sound defensively.

Conrad Smith (Ryan Crotty 48) - 6

Uncharacteristically exposed defensively for May’s first-half try and struggled to gain a foothold in the game with limited possession.

McCaw holds the Hillary Shield, the trophy England and New Zealand have played for since 2008

Sonny-Bill Williams - 7

Carried the ball with real menace but was generally well marshalled by his diminutive opposite man Eastmond. A couple of trademark big hits.

Julian Savea - 7

Didn’t see as much ball as he would have liked but was a threat every time he had it. A couple of thundering early hits on Rokoduguni.

Aaron Cruden (Beauden Barrett 60) - 8

Radar not finely tuned in front of goal but looked sharp with ball in hand. Would have wanted more possession to set his backs free.

Aaron Smith (TJ Perenara 66) - 7

Tidy, composed and assured in the best tradition of All Black No9s. Does not possess electric pace but makes few mistakes. 

Wyatt Crockett (Ben Franks 60) - 7

Solid scrummaging display and sound all-round contribution from a high-class operator who rarely takes a backward step.

Dane Coles - 7

Can consider himself unfortunate to have been sin binned after being wound up by Hartley. High work-rate and technically excellent.

While his kicking wasn't brilliant Aaron Cruden was sharp with the ball in hand for the All Blacks

Owen Franks (Charlie Faumuina 48) - 6

His powerful charge led to McCaw’s early second-half try but was under pressure in the few scrums he was required for.

Brodie Retallick (Patrick Tuipuluto 40) - 6

Solid if unspectacular. Worked hard and ran the line out efficiently before departing at half time. Tidy and effective.

Sam Whitelock- 7

Under pressure in the lineout but produces so much quality around the pitch. An outstanding performer. 

Jerome Kaino (Liam Messam 67) - 7

Some thunderous tackling and powerful carrying from the All Blacks’ hulking blindside. Consistently effective.

Kieran Read - 7

Still yet to show his very best at Twickenham but made few mistakes and was a constant worry for England. Carried effectively without fireworks.

Richie McCaw - 9

Didn’t always see eye-to-eye with referee Owens but still showed enough class to remind why he is one of the greatest ever players.
