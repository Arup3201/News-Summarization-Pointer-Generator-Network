Marketing experts have found people who write negative reviews on websites are often a retailer's most valuable and loyal customers

People who write negative reviews on websites are often a retailer's most valuable and loyal customers, American research suggests.

Retail specialists at MIT and Northwestern University found the harshest of critics may not have brought the product they were complaining about, but had strong feelings about a service or brand.

The study, which is the first to take an in-depth look at the behaviour of customers who write negative reviews online, has disproved popular theories that peeved competitors or oddball customers make the harshest critics.

Professor Eric Anderson of Northwestern University and Professor Duncan Simester of MIT, examined over 325,000 online reviews written by customers of a large clothing company and examined more than 7,219 book reviews on Amazon.com to produce their study,Â ABC News reported.

They used data collected by the websites that made it possible to match reviews to purchases made.

The experts concluded that a firm's most loyal customers are also their most negative reviewers, or to quote a French maxim, 'your best friends are also your harshest critics.'

Professor Anderson said that no-one had previously looked at the behaviour of individual reviewers before and when they told the clothing company they were receiving negative reviews from their best customers, they were shocked.

They also revealed that the harshest critics had not bought the product they were complaining about and around five per cent of product reviews were written by people who had not bought the item they disliked so much.

The researchers found that these reviews
were also on average much more negative than the 95 per cent of genuine
reviews by customers who had purchased a product.

After much hypothesising, the marketing 
experts concluded that reviewers were acting like 'self-appointed brand 
managers' who like the company and continue buying from it despite 
penning a venomous review.

Retail specialists at MIT and Northwestern University found the harshest of critics had often not brought the product they were complaining about but had strong feelings about a service or brand and were trying something new

They found that critics were often complaining about a new product that is slightly different from a company's core offering and want to tell a company if they suspect it is making a bad decision.

Professor Simester believes that customers feel the need to lie about buying a product to review it as they are looking for credibility.

He told ABC News that many people underestimate the importance of their reviews, which can have a harmful effect on a company's sales.

He thinks the findings of the research might prompt companies to insist that reviewers have bought a specific product first before giving their opinion on it.
