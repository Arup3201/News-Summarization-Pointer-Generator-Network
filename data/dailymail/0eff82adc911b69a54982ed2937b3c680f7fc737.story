The blood-soaked corkscrew a Portuguese underwear model used to cut off his elderly lover's testicles in a glitzy New York City hotelroom was shown to horrified jurors yesterday, in the 22-year-old's murder trial.

Renato Seabra confessed to using the corkscrew to castrate his rich 65-year-old fashion journalist boyfriend Carlos Castro in the January 2011 attack, and prosecutors claim he also used it to gouge at the old man's face.

NYPD detective Ricardo Yanis described to jurors in Manhattan Supreme Court the sickening blood-splattered crime scene at the InterContinental hotel in Times Square, where the bottle opener was found along with a cryptic note.

According to The New York Post,
detectives spent 13 hours combing the horrific castration murder scene 
for evidence and came across the corkscrew laying on a white hotel 
slipper next to a message, written in Portuguese.

'Behind... but good person -- few times,' the note read.

Mr
Yanis also showed jurors a broken and bloody wine glass they found in 
the hotel room and described how the crime scene was a mess of 
blood-soaked towels, discarded laundry and Mr Castro's testicles.

'Here
you have a white blanket cover, and the black sneakers, and the 
decedent's testicle on the white blanket,' Mr Yanis testified, later 
pointing out the other testicle, sitting on the carpet next to the 
room's bed as if it had been thrown there.

Mr
Seabra's defense lawyers say the carnage is evidence the young model 
was insane when he struck out, and that statements to a psychologist 
explain that the 22-year-old thought he was saving his lover by ridding 
him of the 'evil' and 'demons' within, The Post reported.

He
even slit his own wrists and held Mr Castro's severed testicles to his 
hands to 'harness their power' in the five hours he was in the room with
the body, the model explained to his doctors.

On Thursday, a hotel security guard 
who discovered the fashion journalist's naked and mutilated corpse 
testified that the hotel room he was murdered in was drenched in blood.

Mr Seabra and Mr Castro were on vacation at the InterContinental Hotel in Manhattan last year, when the slaying took place.

Wilfredo
Gonzalez described the crime scene to jurors, saying: 'There was all 
this blood on the floor, towels all over the place, glass. There was 
just damage all over the place.

'Then I opened the door further. And I saw the body. He was naked and there was blood around the groin area and his face.'

Mr Seabra is accused of bludgeoning, 
strangling and castrating his 65-year-old lover with a corkscrew and 
wearing his testicles as a bracelet.

Defense attorneys are arguing the 
crime was so perverse that the young model was insane when acting out 
the frenzied attack.

Prosecutors are arguing it was a cold-blooded murder carried out after Castro tried to end the three-month relationship.

'So, it was clear to you that he was deceased?' prosecutor Maxine 
Rosenthal asked the guard. 'Why was that clear to you?'

'Because of the amount of blood that was there, and the blood that was 
there was very dark,' Mr Gonzalez said. 'Like it was sitting there awhile.'

The taxi driver who took what he called a 'calm and normal' Mr Seabra to the hospital also testified yesterday, according to The New York Post.

Despite the model's claims to doctors 
that he walked around the city with his lover's testicles touching 
members of the public to 'cure' them of demons and AIDS, the cab driver 
said there was no such talk of this when he saw him and he did not seem 
insane.

Aspiring model: The defense claims that Mr Seabra, 22, had a psychotic break when he murdered his older lover while on vacation in New York

'So in love': A friend of Carlos Castro (right) 
said he had lavished his younger lover Renato Seabra (left) with gifts 
before the younger man allegedly castrated him in a New York hotel room

'He told me to take him to a good hospital,' Senegalese native Cheikh 
Bbacke told jurors, adding that Mr Seabra then made a bizarre inquiry into where New York 
City keeps its waste.

Earlier this week, Wanda Pires, a 
close friend of Mr Castro, said her friend described the relationship as 
'the best thing that ever happened in his life'.

Ms Pires said Mr Castro had given the
aspiring model free rein with his credit card and had planned trips to 
shopping malls, casinos and basketball games during their vacation, 
according to the New York Post.

The ambitious younger man was also hoping to find modelling work through a Manhattan agency.

Ms
Pires added that the couple, who had been together since October 2010, 
were so in love they would even feed each other over meals.

She added: 'Every time they went to eat they were sharing food with each other… very friendly, very happy.'

However
according to Pires' testimony, Mr Seabra taunted Mr Castro by trying to get 
the phone numbers of young women on the day before the murder. 

Murder trial: Defense lawyers for Seabra have claimed that he suffered a psychotic break whereas the prosecution said that he strangled and mutilated Castro out of rage

The relationship between the two soured when Mr Castro later caught Mr Seabra going out with a group of young women.

On January 7, 2011, tensions came to a head when Mr Seabra and Mr Castro got into a 
fight over the older man's plans to send his lover home, thus signalling
the end of their whirlwind romance.

Ms
Pires told jurors that she spoke to Mr Castro on the morning he died and 
he said the couple had fought all night and Mr Seabra had declared he was 
no longer gay.

The prosecution hope to debunk the defense's claim that Mr Seabra fell into an hour-long psychotic
fit when he bludgeoned Mr Castro with a TV, strangled him and then cut off
his testicles with a corkscrew while he was still alive.

District Attorney Maxine Rosenthal earlier 
described Mr Seabra as a hot-headed, gold-digger who realized that his free
ride was over and killed Mr Castro out of anger, not insanity.

Defense attorney Rubin Sinins told jurors last week during opening testimony that Mr Seabra had a psychotic fit when he cut off his lover's testicles and slit his own wrists.

'He put one [testicle] on each wrist,' 
Mr Sinins told the court. 'He did this for his protection. He could also 
harness the power.

'He wandered the streets of Manhattan, touching 
people, because he had the power to cure people from AIDS, because he 
had the power to cure them.'

Luxury: Castro and Seabra had a huge fight while staying at the high-end InterContinental Hotel in Manhattan which ended in Castro's brutal death

The lawyer went on, telling the jury 
that Mr Seabra explained to police the day after the murder that ‘he 
believed Mr Castro's testicles were demons, and that by pulling them 
out everything would be right with the world'.

The lawyer asked the jury to acquit 
Mr Seabra by reason of insanity, with the possibility of being committed to
a psychiatric facility.

‘He was in another world,’ Mr Sinins told
jurors. ‘He was deluded into thinking that he was a special messenger 
from God, on a mission to make the world a better place.’

However,
the prosecution implored the panel not to believe the psychotic episode
story, insisting that there was nothing in the 21-year-old’ medical 
history to suggest even mild mental illness.

Court papers presented by prosecutors
described a statement police said Mr Seabra gave after the January 7 death
of Mr Castro while the two were on holiday in Manhattan.

The account depicted an argument in a 
hotel room that turned vicious and escalated into a prolonged hour-long 
frenzy, with Mr Seabra first choking his companion, then stabbing him with a
corkscrew in his face and groin.

Mr Seabra
also admitted to hitting Mr Castro on the head with a monitor 
and stamping on his face while wearing shoes, the papers said.

After the attack Mr Seabra told police, he showered, put on a suit and left.

The 21-year-old, Mr Seabra, was a 
contestant in 2010 on a Portuguese television show called A Procura Do 
Sonho, or 'Pursuit Of A Dream', which hunts for modelling talent.

Although
he did not win the show, he gained a modelling contract with an agency 
founded by designer Fatima Lopes, who developed the show and was a 
judge.

The trial continues on Monday.
