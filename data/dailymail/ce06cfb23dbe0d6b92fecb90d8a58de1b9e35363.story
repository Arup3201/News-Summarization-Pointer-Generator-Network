Heather McCartney, a 26-year-old Scottish model caused a social media storm when she took off her clothes and danced in front of thousands of supporters at the Melbourne Cricket Ground as Hawthorn were beating the Sydney Swans.

The Gold Coast woman spent the night in a police cell and was fined $300 for indecent manner.

McCartney spoke out after her court appearance on Sunday - and revealed she stripped off for a bet. 

'It was a bet. I said if Hawthorn win, I’m getting naked. They won, and I got naked,' she told the Herald Sun.

Ms McCartney said she stripped on a bet: 'What a f---ing day, it was great'

'What a f---ing day, it was great.'

McCartney posted a raunchy photograph of herself, with her hair in pigtails, wearing just a yellow bikini top and dark bottoms and a red AFL ball in one hand on Monday morning.

She captioned: 'What a weekend! Had a blast with my girl. Melbourne.'

One man who claimed he was in the box during the stunt said McCartney was hired for the day and was promised double pay if she 'got naked and cheered in front of everyone'.

Despite receiving messages of congratulations on Facebook, the incident has angered officials at the MCG,who have launched an investigation.

MCC spokesman Shane Brown told the Herald sun it would work with Victoria Police and the client to establish the circumstances, and appropriate action would be taken.

'From the evidence available, we are very disappointed ... and are taking the matter seriously,' he said.

An AFL spokesman said they were also awaiting on information from the MCC regarding the investigating. 

AFL Fans Association spokesman Brian Clarke told the Herald Sun he was disgusted by the return of the 'blokey culture' to AFL.

'It’s a disgrace. It’s the people’s game and it’s for families,' he said.

'This goes against everything the AFL has been trying to achieve. I hope the AFL come down hard on those who were behind this.' 

The model was forced to the ground and cuffed in an unknown state of undress.

During her arrest, she reportedly yelled ‘f*** off, I don’t have to tell you anything, you f**ing r****d,’ before hitting an officer in the face, the Sun Herald also claims. 

Images of McCartney cavorting naked in the MCG corporate box have gone viral on social media, with disbelieving onlookers snapped in the background.

She was released from Melbourne Remand Centre after a night in custody and appeared in the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Sunday.

McCartney was seen leaving court on Sunday morning, holding a clear plastic bag of her belongings, including her clothes, shoes and make up. 

She was wearing black tights and a dark grey knitted jumper and had no shoes on at the time.

The court was told that McCartney was dared to strip naked if Hawthorn won the Grand Final against Swans

McCartney has gained a significant number of followers on her official Facebook fan page 'Miss Lady Darling' after Saturday night's explicit stunt.

One Facebook user named Kevin Richardson commented: 'How was your night in the slammer Heather??'

Scott Evan said: 'Awesome show yesterday!' 

Michael Coyte said: 'well done darling'

William Divic said: 'Damn didn't recognize you with clothes on'

The court was told that she accepted an invitation to attend the corporate box and dared to strip if Hawthorn won.

The Hawks (21.11.137) easily claimed the cup over the Sydney Swans (11.8.74). 

However, there are claims that Ms McCartney was hired to strip, according to Herald Sun.

McCartney's lawyer told the court 'she didn’t understand at the time it could lead to police involvement'.

The court also heard that alcohol and strong medication for aplastic anaemia had made her unable to control her actions.

Magistrate Alan Spillane described her conduct as 'pretty nasty offending.'

'The part I think is really worrying is basically you were biting and hitting out at people who were out trying to do their job.'

At 6.15pm police received reports of a naked woman in a corporate box.

McCartney pleaded guilty to several charges including an act in an indecent manner.
