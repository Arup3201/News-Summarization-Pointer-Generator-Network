A teenage Iraqi girl has told how she is being sexually abused on a daily basis after being captured by Islamic State fighters.

The 17-year-old says she is among 40 Yazidi women being kept as sex slaves after their town was seized by the extremist group four weeks ago.

She said her ordeal was so horrific she often wished she were beaten to death.

'There's a part of me that just wants to die,' she said.

'But there is another part of me that still hopes that I will be able to embrace my parents once again.'

The girl was allowed to speak to Italian newspaper La Repubblica on her mobile phone because her captors wanted the world to know about her horrendous treatment, it was reported by The Daily Telegraph.

Her parents, who fled to a refugee camp in Kurdistan, gave the newspaper her mobile number.

She added: 'To hurt us even more, they told us to describe in detail to our parents what they are doing.

'They
 laugh at us because they think they are invincible. They consider 
themselves are supermen. But they are people without a heart.

'We've asked our jailers to shoot us dead, to kill us, but we are too valuable for them.'

She said some of the girls were as young as 13 and had been shocked into silence as a result of the abuse they had suffered.

They are all being held in a building with barred windows which is guarded by armed fighters in a village south of the ISIS stronghold of Mosul, the girl said.

The women were all snatched when the Islamic State stormed the town of Sinjar on August 3, forcing thousands of the minority Yazidi sect to flee into the nearby mountain of the same name.

With tens of thousands trapped on the mountaintop by encircling jihadists, the U.S. and UK was called in to help with air strikes and aid drops, allowing many to flee to safety in Syria, Kurdistan and Turkey.

But many women were captured, with some British jihadists boasting that they numbered in excess of 300.
