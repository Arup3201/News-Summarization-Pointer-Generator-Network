Manuel Pellegrini praised his Manchester City players for keeping the pressure on leaders Chelsea with a record-equalling victory at the start of what he called a ‘key’ week.

City beat West Bromwich Albion 3-1 without a recognised striker and head into their match against Burnley with the chance of winning 10 consecutive games for the first time in their history.

City are three points behind Chelsea, but Pellegrini is targeting top spot by the turn of the new year.

‘I think this is a key week because we have to play nine points in just one week,’ Pellegrini said. ‘It is important for us to be as soon as we can at the top of the table so as not to give an advantage for the second half of the season.

‘We are not aware about records but we are aware of adding points because it will be a very close fight for the title this year and we want to keep our title.

‘If we continue in this way maybe we can do it. Any team who can arrive to 86 points can win the title. The title is not just two teams. Other teams will be involved as well. Manchester United.’

City, who have 42 points, face Sunderland at the Etihad Stadium on New Year’s Day after the visit of Burnley. Twice before have the club won nine consecutives matches in all competitions – in the 2011-12 season and a century before that – but never 10.

Pellegrini believes rivals Manchester United have a chance of winning the Premier League 

City won at the Hawthorns through goals from Fernando, Yaya Toure and David Silva. Brown Ideye got a late consolation.

Pellegrini used James Milner up front once more with Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko still injured. Stevan Jovetic made the bench and could feature against Burnley. Captain Vincent Kompany could also return from injury.

‘We scored three goals again without a striker,’ said the City manager. ‘James is a very intelligent player. He knows which movement he must take to create the space.

‘David is a very dangerous player because he finishes very well and has a lot of skill inside the box.

‘Vincent Kompany maybe will be fit (for Burnley). Jovetic was on the bench, so maybe he will be fit for Sunday. He was available to play today, but in this game it was not important for him to play. Also, the pitch was difficult for someone recovering from a muscle injury.’
