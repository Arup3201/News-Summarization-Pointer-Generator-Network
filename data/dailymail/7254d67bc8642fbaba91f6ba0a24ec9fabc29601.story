Benefits Street’s career shoplifter Danny Smith has been sent back to jail after he was caught trying to steal wine from a supermarket.

The father-of-three has been jailed for 14 weeks for trying to shoplift, just days after he was released from his previous five-month sentence, imposed for theft and breaching an ASBO.

The 31-year-old admitted a charge of attempted theft at Birmingham Magistrates’ Court, following his latest arrest on February 22.

Benefits Street's career shoplifter Danny Smith has been sent back to jail after he was caught trying to steal wine from a supermarket

A father and son who were in the Morrisons store in Hagley Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham, spotted Smith as he sat in the back of a police car.

The father, who would not be named, said: 'As we pulled into the car park we saw shop workers running out of the store after someone.

'Two baskets of wine were outside the door.

'We were told by someone at the checkout that it was Danny from Benefits Street.

'We watched the show so we knew who he was.'

He featured heavily in the first episode of Channel 4’s Benefits Street, which was filmed in Winson Green’s James Turner Street.

Smith admitted on camera to having more than 80 criminal convictions and being involved in 200 offences.

He was shown stealing items from shops in Birmingham city centre in the explosive series opener, which attracted hundreds of complaints and over seven million viewers.

In his first interview since the show made global headlines, Smith told the Birmingham Mail he was trying to rebuild his life.

'I went to a jail as a youngster then went back in 2003,' he said.

Benefits Street focuses on the lives of neighbours living in James Turner Street in Birmingham, where, it is claimed, as many as 90 per cent of people claim benefits

The programme, set in Birmingham has attracted hundreds of complaints but has been a massive ratings success for Channel 4, pulling in more than six million viewers

'I stayed out of trouble until about 18 months ago.'

Smith claimed Benefits Street’s cameras followed him when his life was at a 'low ebb' in his life because of a drinking problem.

He also revealed he had become a 'wanted man' and accused Benefits Street’s producers of endangering his life by implying he stole cannabis plants from a drugs gang.

Channel 4 denied his claim.
