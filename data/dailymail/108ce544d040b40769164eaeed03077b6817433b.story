The producer of The Simpsons who revealed in July that he is dying of colon cancer has received countless offers from people interesting in his money.

Since word got out about Sam Simon’s cancer and his desire to give away his vast fortune he has heard from countless people online asking to help rid him of his sizable wealth.

‘Some people just want a million dollars. Or help with college tuition. And the rest have business propositions,’ he laughed. ‘Like that should be my legacy: to lose money on your movie or your moisturizer line.’

Sam Simon, co-creator of 'The Simpsons,' was diagnosed with colorectal cancer last November and doesn't have long left to live

Simon created the hit cartoon alongside Matt Groening in 1991. He technically retired from The Simpsons in 1993, but still receives tens of millions in royalties every season.

In November Simon was diagnosed with advanced colon cancer after a year of inconclusive tests and mysterious discomfort. 

Having defied that diagnosis’ original death sentence - he was given three to six months to live - Simon continues to push ahead with no whiff of ‘Why me?’

‘Instead, I think, “This is a really bad situation - and what else can I do to get out of it?’”

The 58-year-old fervent philanthropist is spending his final months funding projects that feed homeless people and save animals from being killed in animal shelters.

‘I’m supporting the charities that I supported during my lifetime,’ he states, ‘and I want to continue to do that.’

Simon grew up comfortably in Beverly Hills, where his father was in the garment industry, not showbiz.

After turning his drawing talent into a job at an animation studio that made cartoons for kids, Simon submitted a script, on spec, to the ABC comedy ‘Taxi.’ His script was bought and produced, and Simon, in his 20s, was hired as a staff writer and soon rose to be the showrunner.

From there he joined a new NBC sitcom called ‘Cheers,’ where he was staff writer for its ascendant first three seasons.

In 1987 he became a writer and executive producer on the Fox comedy series ‘The Tracey Ullman Show,’ teamed alongside James L. Brooks, the comedy legend with whom he had worked on ‘Cheers’ and ‘Taxi,’ and, of course, cartoonist Matt Groening. They became the founding fathers of ‘The Simpsons.’

‘The Simpsons’ began as interstitial 
cartoon clips aired during the otherwise live-action ‘Ullman’ show 
until, in 1989, it was spun off as a Fox half-hour of its own.

Simon
 was named creative supervisor, and he hired the first writing staff as 
well as creating several Springfield citizens, including Mr. Burns, the 
cadaverous industrialist, and Dr. Hibbert, the buffoonish physician.

Although Simon remained the least-known of the three creators, by many accounts he was the most hands-on.

‘You
 can't overstate his contribution to “The Simpsons,'" says talk-show 
star Conan O'Brien, who was a ‘Simpsons’ writer and producer in the 
early 1990s. ‘No one's smarter than he is.’

The
 show - TV's first successful prime-time animated series since ‘The 
Flintstones’ nearly three decades before - caught the public off-guard 
with its sly but perceptive look at the culture.

‘With “The Simpsons,” people didn't know what they were gonna see,’ says Simon. ‘They didn't have a clue.’

The
 show was given time and free reign to flourish by the fledgling Fox 
network. ‘I don't think you get that sort of creative freedom with any 
broadcast shows today.’

Close: Sam Simon has no children and is not married so he wants to give his millions to causes he cares about. He was married to actress Jennifer Tilly in the 1980s but divorced in 1991 though they remain close

Simon left ‘The Simpsons’ after its fourth season in 1994 owing to a strained relationship with Groening.

But
 it was a lucrative departure. His exit deal entitled him to royalties 
from ‘The Simpsons’ that, as it enters its 25th season this fall, 
annually pad Simon's wallet by tens of millions of dollars.

He
 has played no role on the show in nearly 20 years (not even watching 
it, he says), even as his name remains in the weekly credits along with 
Groening's and Brooks' - and his checks roll in.

This sweet annuity has bankrolled the causes and alternative lifestyle he increasingly came to embrace.

Among
 his charitable efforts, he established the Sam Simon Foundation, which 
rescues dogs from animal shelters and trains them to assist disabled 
veterans and the hard-of-hearing.

He
 donated an undisclosed amount of money to the Sea Shepherd Conservation
 Society in 2012 to purchase a vessel for their fleet, which was 
unveiled last December and named for him.

In
 March, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals' Norfolk, Va., 
headquarters were christened the Sam Simon Center in recognition of his 
support for that organization.

Simon's
 largesse carries over to humans, too, including a Los Angeles food bank
 feeding 200 families each day in Simon style: with a vegan menu.

Meanwhile, he keeps his hand in the comedy world, consulting a half-day each week on the FX comedy ‘Anger Management.’

‘Probably
 the highlight of my week,’ he says. ‘That and my radio show,’ which he 
hosts from his home on the online Radioio site – ‘one's on Tuesdays, 
one's on Fridays.’

If he 
sees this as a closeted and tentative existence, Simon doesn't let on. A
 man who boxed for several years as a serious amateur, he now finds 
amusement in his inability to even handle a car.

‘Recently
 I drove home from UCLA Medical Center in Santa Monica, probably a 
four-minute drive,’ he reports with a get-a-load-of-this grin, ‘and I 
got into three accidents on the way home: I hit a stanchion, a tree and 
another car. No one was injured. But afterward I thought, “Maybe 
driving's not a good idea.'"

As
 with everybody else, time is running out for Simon, who has learned to 
make no long-term plans, including recognizing any prospective end date.
 He says death doesn't scare him, however unpleasant getting there may 
be.

‘I'm not sad,’ he 
declares with a wave of his cigar. ‘I'm happy. I don't feel angry and 
bitter. I want to do whatever I can to survive.’
