With an Australian flag tucked between the cheeks of his bare bottom, a man allegedly ‘mooned’ the Queen as she was driven past him in a motorcade today.

Liam Warriner, from Sydney, was later charged with being a public nuisance and wilful exposure after the alleged incident, which is understood to have occurred while the 22-year-old was unloading shipping containers in Brisbane.

‘I mooned the Queen,’ Warriner said after being charged. ‘I did it because my workmates dared me to.’

Remorseless: Liam Warriner today pleaded guilty to a charge of public nuisance at Brisbane Magistrates Court. He was fined AUS$750 (£510) for 'mooning the Queen in the city last October

Guest of honour: The Queen, accompanied by Prince Philip and Queensland Premier Anna Bligh, walks down a slipway to board a cruiser on the Brisbane River. Shortly beforehand, police said the monarch was 'mooned' by Warriner as she passed him in her motorcade

Speaking with a sense of pride at his actions, Warriner added: ‘Everybody’s seen someone’s butt, come on.

‘You see it on TV all the time, you see it in movies, it’s accepted in PG rated programming these days.

‘But yet it’s an offence to the Queen.’

Warriner, who gave the V for victory sign as he spoke, said the Queen waved at him and that was when he dropped his trousers.

But his claim that the Queen had singled him out for a wave was highly unlikely. Thousands of people were lining the 
banks of the Brisbane River along which the Queen was sailing and most 
people were so far away from the cruiser that it is doubtful she saw 
what any individual was doing.

Warriner said he ran for 50 yards with his trousers and underwear down, but no-one saw anything other than his bare bottom.

He said: ‘Not the front at all. There were loads of people there to see the Queen. I wouldn’t want all of them seeing that.’

Warriner is no stranger to protests against authority. He revealed he is part of an anti-elite protest movement called Occupy and had recently taken part in protests in Sydney.

He said: ‘I’d like to say we are the 99 per cent human need over corporate greed and we won’t accept any of this any longer.'

Police later clarified where Warriner had been standing. They said he was in an area at the roadside where the Queen was passing by in a motorcade before she stepped onto the cruiser to sail down the river.

A spokeswoman for Queensland police said: ‘Police officers at the front of the motorcade saw the alleged incident and reported to others further back.'

She said she could not comment on whether or not the Queen had seen the alleged incident.
