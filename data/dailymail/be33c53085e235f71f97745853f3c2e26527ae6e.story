An Ohio woman filed a lawsuit against a Cincinnati hospital over claims that two of its employees leaked her syphilis diagnosis on Facebook.

The lawsuit, obtained by WCPO, is against University of Cincinnati Medical Center (UCMC) and claims her diagnosis was shared on a Facebook group called 'Team No Hoes' in September 2013.

Online commenters called the woman a 'hoe' and a 'slut,' the suit says.

Raphael Bradley, the father of her unborn child, pressured the woman to say why she was seeking medical treatment, but she didn't say why, the suit says. Bradley then told her he would ask UCMC employee Ryan Rawls, the mother of his other child, for the information.

Rawls and a second UCMC employee posted the woman's medical information to Facebook, the suit says. The second woman's name has not yet been released.

Her attorney, Mike Allen, told WCPO she has been cyberbullied since her medical information was shared online. She is seeking over $25,000 in damages.

Meanwhile, UCMC says that an employee was fired over the alleged security breach.

'UC Health became aware of this incident shortly after the screenshot of this patient’s billing record appeared on Facebook, when she brought it to our attention,' the hospital said in a statement. 

'We took swift action and our investigation revealed that the record had been accessed by a Financial Services employee who did not have a business reason to do so. This employee had been fully trained and acknowledged her responsibilities under law and UC Health policy, but apparently accessed the billing record through a personal motivation. The individual’s employment was terminated, and we reported the incident to federal authorities. This occurred within days of the patient making us aware of this occurrence.'The hospital also said that only one employee accessed the information and that 'We made Mr. Allen aware of these findings, but he chose to include the allegations in the Complaint that was recently filed.'
