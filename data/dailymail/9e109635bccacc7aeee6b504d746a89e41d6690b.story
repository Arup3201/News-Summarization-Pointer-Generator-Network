The house where British student Meredith Kercher was brutally murdered has been put up for sale by its owner for £384,000, it emerged today.

With its white washed stone walls and spectacular views of the nearby rolling countryside, the ten bedroom property would make an ideal holiday home but with its grim background potential buyers maybe put off.

A 'for sale' sign went up outside Via della Pergola in Perugia earlier this week and the house is also being advertised on a local estate agents website but there is no obviously mention of Meredith's murder in November 2007 - she was found semi naked and with her throat cut in her bedroom.

Victim: British student Meredith Kercher was found dead in her bedroom with a slit throat

Aldalia Tattanelli, 70, owner of the house, contacted an estate agent earlier this month with a view to selling the property as she lives in 150 miles away in Rome and no longer wants anything to do with it.

The advert describes the two storey property as 'close to the university of foreigners, with a complex character composed of two independent properties, with the prospect of converting into one or making into three, comes with 5,000mq2 of land and parking for seven cars. In excellent condition.'.

Meredith moved into the house in August 2007 after spotting an advert for it shortly after arriving in Perugia where she was due to spend a year studying at the university and her fellow tenants were two Italian women and American student Amanda Knox.

Within weeks of moving in Meredith was dead and Knox, now 26, was charged with murdering and sexually assaulting her, with her then boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 30, and they were both initially convicted but then had their convictions quashed two years ago but that was subsequently  overturned earlier this year.

For two years following the murder the house was under a police confiscation order before it was then returned to Mrs Tatanelli who eventually re-let it at a reduced price to immigrant tenants from Bangladesh and the Congo who were students at the nearby university.

Since then there has been a steady flow of tenants in and out of the house but it has also been noted for several high profile incidents including being broken into by Satanists several times as well as most recently last month when the current tenants were rushed to hospital after being overcome by carbon monoxide from a faulty heater.

The family of eight Moroccans including two newborn babies were living in the basement flat of the house but the upper floor where Meredith and Knox lived is currently unoccupied.

Estate agent Vincenzo Russo, who is handing the sale, said: 'We've not had any calls yet about the property but it is still early days.

Ongoing: Amanda Knox, pictured in April this year during an interview with ABC News' Diane Sawyer, will find out the verdict of an appeal court over Meredith's murder next month

'The sign only went up earlier his week and it's online as well but Christmas has been in between as well so I'm hoping that once the holidays are over we will get some interest.

'It's not a good time of year to market a house but I'm sure we will get calls about it - the house is in excellent position and would make an ideal holiday home or if someone wants to convert it they could get two possibly three separate units and then rent them out to students - it's very close to the university and the centre of town.

'There has been some interest via the internet and I hope that is from genuine buyers as opposed to people having a morbid curiosity in the history of the house.

'I have a feeling though that because of its history the house will be difficult to sell but it should be said that it is in excellent condition and a very good buy for its location.'

An appeal court is expected to return its verdict on the fresh hearing against Knox and Sollecito next month.
