A water-main break on Friday sent churning, muddy water flowing down West Hollywood's Sunset Strip, forcing authorities to close a section of the busy street to traffic as hotels and other businesses sought to keep their properties dry.

The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power was determining what valves needed to be closed to shut off the flow of water, which was spreading into surrounding streets.

No injuries were reported.

Residents were instructed to avoid the area for feat that the water could unexpectedly 'knock people off their feet,' according to officials. 

The break occurred in a 36-inch steel, riveted pipe that was constructed in 1916. The pipe was coated with cement in 1957 to prolong its life, department spokesman Joe Ramallo said.

There were no reports of customers losing water service, Ramallo said.

It was the second time in recent months that Sunset Boulevard — a traffic artery in and around Los Angeles — has been closed by a flood created by a broken water main.

In July, the rupture of a nearly century-old water main ripped a 15-foot hole through the boulevard and turned a swath of the University of California, Los Angeles into a swamp. Hundreds of cars and campus buildings were damaged by that break.

On average, the Department of Water and Power's aging water system has three breaks a day in 7,200 miles of piping.

Friday's break, which created a steady spout of water along a sidewalk, occurred shortly after 2:30 p.m.

Los Angeles County firefighters were going door to door to make sure no one was trapped by the water.

Water also spilled onto nearby Santa Monica Boulevard, although that street was not immediately closed.

Metro buses scheduled to drive on Sunset Boulevard between North San Vicente Boulevard and North Fairfax Avenue planned to detour onto Santa Monica Boulevard, reported KTLA.
