A Boston man has been indicted in the brutal killing of a 24-year-old woman and in three unrelated non-fatal attacks.

Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley and Acting Police Commissioner Bill Evans announced the indictments Friday against 29-year-old Edwin Alemany.

Alemany has pleaded not guilty in the death Amy Lord, a Wilbraham native living in South Boston. He is held at a state psychiatric hospital for evaluation.

'Serial attacker': Edwin Alemany, 29, pictured here in August, was indicted in the July murder of 24-year-old Amy Lord and attacks on three other women, one of which took place in September 2012

The indictment also charges him in two
 attacks on women the same week Lord was killed, and in a 2012 attack in
 which the alleged victim grabbed his wallet and told police, according to Boston.com.

Police officials have demoted a detective they said failed to pursue the 2012 case, and reprimanded three supervisors.

Lord's body was found in July in a wooded area of Hyde Park in Boston 
after the woman was kidnapped, viciously beaten, forced to withdraw 
money from several ATMs, and ultimately stabbed to death.

She
 was one of the three young women attacked in the same area in a 24-hour
 period. Alemany is suspected of carrying out all three.

During a press conference Friday announcing the indictment against Alemany, District Attorney Conley insisted that the 29-year-old man was of a sound mind when he savagely murdered Lord.

‘The level of violence visited on her shocked the entire city of Boston, including hardened police and prosecutors with decades of experience,’ he said. ‘But it was not the beginning or the end of Alemany’s violent sprees.’

After Alemany was identified as the prime suspect in the killing, it was revealed that Boston police may have had the chance to arrest him a year earlier after he allegedly attacked another woman.

The incident happened September 28 at around 2.30am in the Mission Hill section of Boston, where Alemany allegedly assaulted a 20-year-old woman from behind and tried to choke her, according to the station NECN.

However, the victim put up a fight and managed to snatch her attacker's wallet containing his ID card and knocked off his baseball hat before he fled.

The attack was reported to police, but Alemany was never questioned.

Today, Conley said that the DNA evidence collected from the cap was 'strongly consistent' with Alemany's DNA.

In the aftermath of the revelation that Boston police had failed to do their due diligence while investigating the 2012 attack, a detective was demoted and three other law enforcement officials were punished.

Alemany has been suffering from mental health issues since he was a teenager and has had multiple run-ins with the law, mostly for minor property crimes like trespassing and theft. 

Conley said it is unclear at this time what triggered Alemany to turn violent and launch random attacks on young women walking alone in the afterhours.

Alemany is being held on $3million bail. He will be formally arraigned on all the charges in December.

Amy Lord, a digital marketer, left her Dorchester home at 5.30am 
to take a bus downtown to go to the gym with a friend, The Boston Globe reported.

But she never made it to the gym.

Alemany is accused of beating her inside her home, forcing her into her 
jeep and taking her to five different ATMs to take money out before 
brutally murdering her.

After the murder, officials said Alemany spent $400 in cash on a cellphone and paid some
 cellphone bills.

His defense attorney Jeffrey Denner 
told the judge today that his client had tried to kill himself by tearing open
 arteries with his bare hands, leaving him with self-inflicted scratches
 to his neck and arms.

Not guilty pleas to the murder and 
kidnapping charges were entered on Alemany’s behalf and he was ordered to be
held without bail.

In the other incidents, a 22-year-old woman was attacked at Andrew Square at
 5am on the same day. Conley said Alemany knocked her to the ground and dragged her by the legs to a parking lot.

'He allegedly told her he wasn’t going to rob her – he was going to kill her,' the district attorney said.

Just after midnight the following day - about 18 hours after
Amy Lord was killed - the 29-year-old suspect allegedly attacked a 21-year-old
woman outside her home and began stabbing her. The woman cried for help,
prompting her attacker to flee.

She was rushed to Tufts Medical Center with wounds to her
neck, face and torso. Once there, the victim gave a detailed description of her
assailant.

In an ironic twist, Alemany badly cut his hand on the knife
used in the attack, Conley said, and went to the same hospital as his victim.

Paramedics instantly recognized Alemany as the suspected thug
and called police.

to the big city.'

Lord
 was a 2011 graduate of Bentley University in Waltham with a bachelor’s 
degree in marketing, quantitative perspectives, the university said in a
 statement.
