A model has used Twitter to publicly humiliate a married soap actor who tried to chat her up on a plane.

Melissa Stetten, a 28-year-old New York-based model, live-tweeted a conversation yesterday with Brian Presley, a 34-year-old actor from Oklahoma, who told her that he believed they were 'brought together' by God on the flight.

The actor also allegedly drank 'three Heinekens' on the domestic red-eye flight out of Los Angeles, despite having told Christianity Today in April that he attends 'weekly AA meetings with a group of awesome, godly men from my church.'

Just one of the model's many amusing Twitter posts 
reads: 'Brian just said "like us sitting here right now, taking about 
where we're from, it's like divine interception". right, interception.'

At first the model didn't realise who she was sitting next to on the flight, just tweeting 'No thanks, Brian, the actor sitting next to me on this flight talking about his role with Kurt Russell and his spiritual beliefs.'

It was only when one of her 13,000 followers sent her his identity, the messages became more interesting as the actor, a former star of Port Charles which was a 
spin-off TV series of General Hospital, has previously spoken publicly about his journey to sobriety and religion.

Commentary: It followed everything from the actor's stance on gay marriage to his early acting roles

During the pair's alleged conversation, he claimed that he is not married to his wife of ten years Erin Hershey Presley, when he in fact met Mrs Presley on the 
show's set - the pair were co-stars and now have two children.

The model posted at a later stage of the
 commentary: 'He said he was engaged for 6 months but broke it off! RT 
@Pat_Healy: @MelissaStetten Ask him how his wife Erin and son Jackson 
are.'

The actor has yet to respond to the Twitter postings and is yet to respond to MailOnline's request.

Knowledge: Miss Stetten learns via the social networking site that the actor recently claimed he's sober

Nice one Brian: The model reveals how the actor responded to her questioning

Charmer: She tweeted that her took off his wedding ring - the tweet was later deleted

Family man: The actor met his wife of ten years on the set of a soap called Port Charles, they have two children

The model, was born in Kalamazoo, 
Michigan, posted the detailed description as he chatted to her from the 
seat beside her on a red-eye flight to New York.

She
 expressed an unwillingness to engage in the conversation right from her
 first tweet, but it seems that the actor, who has 
appeared in guest roles in Beverly Hills 90210 and 7th Heaven in the 
past, couldn't take the hint.

This morning Melissa, ever the honorable Tweeter posted his response to her account of the flight.

In the post, which appears on 
Facebook, Brian brands Melissa 'weird' and said that in his soap opera 
career he had never encountered such 'good writing.'

The actor, who ends his message with the words 'sobriety rocks', said Melissa's account is untrue and at times 'absurd'.

He ends by thanking his fans for support.

Sobriety Rocks: The actor's response, posted this morning... by Melissa Stetten

Through her tweets, her Twitter 
followers learned that 'Brian... is an artist and believes everything 
happens for a reason like how we're brought together on this flight'.

He is also 'a straightforward guy who booked a McDonalds commercial when he was 19 and then God took over from there'.

The actor, who stars in the new movie Touchback, later told the model a further lie about his marital status.

Beauty: She has almost 18,700 followers on Twitter, who seemed to be captivated by her posts

Soon enough, Miss Stetten's followers, which now total almost 18,700, began posting actual facts about the actor.

The model then acknowledged the possible repercussions of her running commentary.

She posted: 'Did I just ruin Brian Presley's life via Twitter?'

'Brian is now talking about how he is an artist and believes everything happens for a reason, like how we're brought together on this flight'
