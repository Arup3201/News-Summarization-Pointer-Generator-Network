America’s love affair with bacon is apparently never ending and so it should come as no surprise then that we have finally arrived at bacon-flavored coffee.

It might be a little late to the party - after all recent years have already witnessed a wide array of bacon-benefited products including sodas, cocktails and even cologne - but those two great stables of a hearty breakfast have finally been blended together.

Boca Java, a gourmet company that specializes in direct trade premium coffee, has created the ‘Maple Bacon Morning’ blend that aims to combine all the meaty, salty deliciousness of bacon with the rich aroma and full body of freshly ground coffee.

Perfect combination? If you've ever longed for all the taste of bacon and coffee in one drink then this could be the beverage for you

Specialty grade Arabica coffee beans are enhanced with the sweet flavors of maple syrup and bacon and then roasted on demand to ensure freshness. Sound interested? You can pick up two packs of this revolution in coffee at Amazon for US$16.

So ingenious idea or the sound of the bacon barrel being scrapped?

Overall the reviews on Amazon are quite positive. They range from the foaming at the mouth bacon-alholic who writes 'bacon coffee is my own personal savior of flavor and deity-like alertness' to others that are a little less positive and complain that there is little or no bacon taste to it.

However if you this kind of person who believes that everything tastes better with a bit of bacon in it then this is undoubtedly the coffee for you.

Bacon-flavored coffee - ingenious idea or the sound of the barrel being scrapped? Reviews have been mixed

Coffee isn't the most unusual bacon-flavored product to hit the market in recent months, that would be the pork-flavored condoms which launched in March.

Manufacturers J&D's decided that consumers loved bacon so much that not only did they want it with their eggs, but under the sheets. The company's motto is 'everything should taste like bacon.'

The latex condoms have been coated in a 'baconlube,' a water-based personal lubricant that carries a meaty flavor.

Even the wrappers are decorated with a picture of a bacon strip, and the condom itself is colored to look like a piece of bacon.

J&D's assures buyers these condoms have been rigorously tested

'J&D’s Bacon Condoms are proudly Made in America of the highest 
quality latex,' the company promises.

'Every Bacon Condom has been rigorously tested to help 
ensure reliability and the utmost safety for when you’re makin’ Bacon.'

'As an added bonus, J&D’s baconlube ultra premium water based 
meat flavored personal lubricant has been generously applied inside and 
out for an even more hot pork experience.'
