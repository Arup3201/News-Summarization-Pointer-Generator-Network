Jordan Rossiter grabbed the winner as Liverpool beat Tottenham in the Under 21 Premier League on Friday night.

The 17-year-old midfielder, who has featured in Brendan Rodgers' first-team squad for Capital One Cup matches this season, struck early in the second half to halt a run of three straight defeats.

Ryan Kent had given Liverpool the lead at Langtree Park in St Helens, only for Will Miller to equalise for Spurs shortly before the break.

Tottenham, coached by former England defender Ugo Ehiogu, were the pre-match favourites on form, having beaten Chelsea on Monday night.

But it was Liverpool who started the more positively, almost opening the scoring inside the first minute when Jerome Sinclair saw his curling shot come back off the post after Jordan Williams had played him in.

The hosts received a scare when Miller fired just over the bar but continued to press and Harry Wilson missed his kick with the goal beckoning after Spurs goalkeeper Tom Glover had misjudged a cross.

Glover atoned a minute later when he turned Kent's powerful shot over the bar but the Liverpool winger wasn't to be denied on 27 minutes.

After winning a free-kick on the edge of the box, Kent dusted himself down to fire the ball past Glover's reach and give Liverpool a deserved lead.

Tottenham responded well to the setback and Miller should have done better in a good shooting position after Emmanuel Sonupe had surged clear down the right and cut the ball back.

Daniel Akindayini then forced Liverpool goalkeeper Danny Ward into a point-blank save as the game developed into an end-to-end encounter, with Wilson striking the post with a clever dink that beat Glover.

Tottenham levelled when Miller fired low beyond Ward after his initial effort from Sonupe was saved.

The visitors started the second half brightly and would have taken the lead but for alert defending on the line from Dan Cleary after Akindayini ran clean through and rounded Ward.

The miss would prove costly as Rossiter restored Liverpool's lead on 52 minutes after Kent delivered the perfect cut-back for him.

Tottenham continued to press and Liverpool could have done with a third goal. The closest they came was when substitute Daniel Trickett-Smith's diving header flew wide after Kevin Stewart had cross from the right.

MANCHESTER CITY 3 EVERTON 1

Manchester City went top of the Under 21 Premier League with a 3-1 win over Everton at Ewen Fields in Hyde.

Goals from Seko Fofana, Thierry Ambrose and Brandon Barker gave Patrick Vieira's team a commanding three-goal lead by half-time, with Hallam Hope's late reply proving merely a consolation for the visitors.

City currently lead their Manchester rivals United by a point but have played three matches more.

ARSENAL 2 MIDDLESBROUGH 1

Arsenal leapfrogged Middlesbrough to assume leadership of Division Two after Daniel Crowley struck in stoppage time at Boreham Wood's Meadow Park.

After 70 minutes of stalemate, Crowley fired Arsenal into the lead on 72 minutes only for Scott McCarthy to equalise with just a minute remaining.

But Crowley wasn't satisfied with a point and he smashed the ball home from 18 yards to win it in the dying seconds.
