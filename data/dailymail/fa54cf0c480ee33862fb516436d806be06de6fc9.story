Hurricane-force winds and heavy rain have battered large swathes of the country today as an extreme weather front blows in and threatens to last all weekend.

Up to 32,000 homes in Scotland are still without power following destructive 100mph gales yesterday and snowfalls and ice overnight have made some roads impassable.

In Manchester, an IKEA store was forced to shut down after ferocious winds blew tiles of the roof, and in Cumbria a lorry was blown on its side as it travelled along the A66.

Heavy snowfalls and ice overnight have made some roads impassable and access to the network difficult.

Alan Broadbent, SSE's director of engineering told the BBC: 'Our electricity network was battered continuously by hurricane winds for eight hours on Thursday night and during much of Friday.

'This has weakened it in places, which caused more power cuts overnight.

'I know an apology may not be much comfort for our customers who have been without power, but I would like to reassure them that we are doing all we possibly can during extremely treacherous, challenging and severe weather conditions.'
