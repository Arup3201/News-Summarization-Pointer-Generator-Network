The first American woman to become a professional bullfighter in Mexico has died at the age of 83 alone and in near poverty after blazing a trail for gender equality more than half a century ago.

During her 1950’s heyday, Patricia McCormick stood out not only because she was a woman but her skills and bravery quickly gained her a reputation as a very talented fighter.

‘Had she not been born a woman,’ a rival and one of Mexico’s elite matadors told Sports Illustrated in 1963, ‘she might have been better than any of us.’

Patricia McCormick, the first American woman to become a professional bullfighter, has died at the age of 83

During her 10 year career McCormick received top billing in stadiums from Mexico to South America

Her career started in 1951 and over the next decade she performed in hundreds of bullfights, receiving top billing in stadiums from Mexico to South America.

She received top billing and drew thousands of fans. One bullfighting critic called her 'the most courageous woman I have ever seen.'

While her talents and bravery was admired by her male counterparts, it was they who prevented her from advancing and she remained a novillera, or apprentice fighter.

Progress to a higher rank would have required the sponsorship of a matador and none were prepared to do that for a woman.

The discrimination she received didn’t stop her from demanding to be treated equally, she always insisted on fighting large bulls and on foot, rather than horseback.

Injuries were not uncommon, she was gored on six occasions and in 1954 she nearly died after a bull caught her on the thigh.

‘The horn went right up my stomach,’ she told The Los Angeles Times in 1989. ‘The bull carried me around the ring for a minute, impaled on his horns.’

‘They gave me the last rites there,' she recalled. 'The doctor said, "Carry her across the border and let her die in her own country.'"

She was introduced to bullfighting as a 7-year-old during a family vacation to Mexico City, then when her family moved to West Texas she began crossing the border into Juárez to watch fights.

Eventually she quit college for bullfighting, persuading a retired matador to be her mentor.

Her debut was in 1951 in Juárez. and twice the bull trampled her and tossed her with its horns before she plunged the estoque between its shoulders.

Afterwards the crowd showered her with roses, and she was awarded the bull’s ear for impressing with her skills.

After killing the animal, Ms. McCormick, streaked in blood, knelt down and stroked its head. ‘I loved the brave bull,’ she later wrote in ‘Lady Bullfighter,’ her memoir.

She quit in 1962 moved to California, where she wanted to be an artist and worked as a secretary.

By the early 2000s she had returned to Texas, but was experiencing money problems and was set to lose her home.

A man who had been a fan of Ms McCormick as a young child helped her out and encouraged her to use her fame to help her make some money. Her relationship with Gary Humphreys eventually soured when she sued him and he settled out of court.

In 2006, Ms. McCormick was honored by Ciudad Acuña at its annual Running las Vacas event. In 2007, the Heritage Museum of Big Spring mounted an exhibition on her life and career and invited her to demonstrate her cape work. People waited two hours in line to meet her.

She died on March 26 at 83, in a nursing home in Del Rio, Texas. She never married or had children.
