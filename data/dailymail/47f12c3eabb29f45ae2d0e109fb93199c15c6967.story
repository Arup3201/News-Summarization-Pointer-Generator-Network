California could become the first state to ban hunting with lead ammunition if Gov. Jerry Brown signs leglislation approved by the Senate.

The controversial bill AB711 is supported not just by environmentalists who say lead is deadly for the endangered condor, but also by those who say fragments of the bullets may be eaten by animals and end up in the food chain, endangering humans.

However gun lobbyists including the National Rifle Association (NRA) say the proposed ban would lead to job losses and a reduction in hunting licenses which pay for conservation projects, while replacement copper bullets would be much more expensive.

Meat fears: Governor Jerry Brown may make California the first state with a ban on hunting with lead bullets

There is already a ban on hunting with lead bullets in eight counties in California where the population of the pre-historic condors is considered in danger, but if Gov. Brown signs AB711, it will be extended state-wide.

The bill, proposed by Assemblymen Anthony Rendon and Richard Pan, is designed to protect not just California's condors, eagles and other wildlife from lead poisoning, but also humans, for whom they 'there is no safe level of lead exposure'.

There are fears the lead from spent bullets may be making its way into hunted meat that is then eaten by humans.  Environmentalists say there is so much lead in meat that has come from hunting that women and pregnant children should not eat it.

'There's no reason to keep putting toxic lead into the food chain or risking human health when there are nontoxic bullets already on the market and in use by hunters,', Jeff Miller, a conservation advocate from the Center for Biological Diversity, told mercurynews.com.

Backer of the bill Dan Taylor, of Audubon California, said there were plenty of alternative metals to make bullets from.

'AB711 is a milestone in the effort to protect wildlife', he told sfgate.com.

'We've removed lead from gasoline, paint and children's toys.  It's clear that lead ammunition has no place in hunting when safer and more effective alternatives are available.'

However the powerful pro-gun lobby is fighting a fierce campaign to stop the law going through, trying to discredit the study the health fears are based on and citing the lack of many alternative bullets for hunters.

NRA lawyer Chuck Michel said copper bullets were more expensive and could cause wildfires because they spark more than lead bullets.

He also said condors could be poisoned by waste they scavenge on in dump sites in more urban areas, adding: 'The point is, there are alternate sources of lead in the environment which are probably the source of the lead.'

Gov. Brown has until 12 October to sign the legislation, and if he does, it will not come into force until mid-2019.
