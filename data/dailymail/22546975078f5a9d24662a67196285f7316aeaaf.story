As cars and homes lie abandoned, this was the scene of devastation today at Fischbeck in central Germany after the entire village became submerged when a dyke burst.

Unable to withstand pressure from the swollen river Elbe after weeks of heavy rain, the levee was breached overnight, prompting officials to evacuate ten villages in the area.

The torrential weather this spring has sent the Elbe, the Danube and other rivers such as the Vltava and the Saale overflowing their banks, causing extensive damage in central and southern Germany, the Czech Republic, Austria, Slovakia and Hungary.

Germany's national railway said it had 
to close a bridge near Fischbeck that is used by trains linking Berlin 
to Cologne, Frankfurt and Amsterdam.

Some trains were being diverted via
other bridges to the north and south, causing significant delays, and 
others were cancelled. 

Thousands of homes have been evacuated along the Elbe after waters threatened to break through levees protecting several other towns.

A few miles upstream from Fischbeck, west of Berlin, around 8,000 people left their houses in the Saxony-Anhalt town of Stendal.

In neighboring Schleswig-Holstein state, the old quarter of Lauenburg near Hamburg was evacuated due to the rising waters of the Elbe.

And in southern Germany, waters were receding and authorities began debating how to pay for the flood damage, estimated at more than 11billion euros (£9.4billion).

So far, the flooding in Europe has claimed at least 22 lives.

As the surge from the Elbe pushes into rural eastern Germany, there was some relief further upstream as the river slipped back from record levels in Magdeburg, the capital of Saxony-Anhalt state.

To the south, the Danube hit a record high on Sunday evening in the Hungarian capital, Budapest, but then began to ease back yesterday.

Officials said the city escaped 
significant damage, and Prime Minister Viktor Orban said soldiers and 
rescue workers would shift their focus further south.

The
German city of Magdeburg grappled over the weekend with water levels 
more than 16ft (5m) above normal, but the Elbe retreated by about a foot
yesterday.

More than 
23,000 residents had to leave their homes on Sunday. Officials said an 
electricity substation in the city was no longer in danger of flooding -
which would have made the situation worse by cutting off power to the 
drainage pumps.

The
low-lying old district of Lauenburg, a riverside town east of Hamburg, 
was evacuated as authorities prepared for floodwaters to peak there 
later this week.

Soldiers and volunteers have worked frantically over the past week to fill sandbags and reinforce flood defenses across central Europe.

Even with all those efforts, 'we should accept that we humans should be humble, that even in the 21st century we don't completely control nature - that is one lesson from this situation,' Saxony-Anhalt's interior minister, Holger Stahlknecht, told ZDF television.

He said it was too early to analyse what, if anything, might have been done to prepare better for flooding.

In Budapest, the Danube peaked late Sunday at about a foot above the previous record, set in 2006.

The Danube widens noticeably below Budapest, reducing the threat of flooding, although Orban said flood walls and other defences were being strengthened in several locations downriver.

River levels across the Czech Republic were falling yesterday, although thunderstorms during the night caused some local flash floods.

The national police chief, Martin Stovicek, said the country's death toll reached 11 after a Slovak man drowned in a river near the southwestern town of Susice.

The flood damage in Germany has been estimated at more than 11billion euros (£9.4billion)
