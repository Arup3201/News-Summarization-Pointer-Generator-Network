The parents of a boy who allegedly died from scurvy appeared in court today accused of child neglect.

Dylan Seabridge, eight, died suddenly at home from the illness, which is linked to a deficiency of vitamin C, in December 2011.

Julie Seabridge, 45, and her husband Glynn Seabridge, 46, indicated to Swansea Crown Court that they will be pleading not guilty in a trial later this year.

Jim Davies, defending Mr Seabridge, 
said: 'Because the allegation is an unusual one we will have to identify
experts who work in a very unusual field.

'It will take some research to identify suitable experts to instruct.'

The couple, from Crymych, Pembrokeshire, were released on unconditional bail today to face trial later this year

Scurvy used to affect anyone who was at sea longer than perishable fruits and vegetables could be stored.

They would begin to suffer when they could not get enough vitamin C - vital for the body as it needs it to make collagen, a type of protein found in many different types of tissue, such as skin, blood vessels, bones and cartilage.

Without vitamin C, collagen can't be replaced and the different types of tissue break down.

Signs of the condition included muscle and joint pain, fatigue, red dots on the skin, and bleeding and swelling of the gums, which can lead to teeth falling out.

In 1753 A Royal Navy Scottish surgeon, James Lind, realised that citrus fruits - which have large amounts of vitamin C - could combat the condition and published a study on it.

Modern treatment involves taking vitamin C supplements and eating food that's high in vitamin C.

No formal plea was entered and the pair from Crymych, Pembrokeshire, were released on unconditional bail.

The pair arrived, both sporting hats and clutching each other's hands.

Both carried walking sticks and wore thick coats.

Scurvy was at one time common among sailors deprived of fresh fruit and vegetables while at sea.

But it is almost unheard of due to modern diets and health care .

Symptoms of scurvy are lethargy, spots on the skin, spongy gums and bleeding from the nose.

Treatment involves taking vitamin C supplements and eating food that's high in vitamin C.

This should quickly reverse the harmful symptoms of scurvy, the NHS says.

Foods such as cabbage, grapefruit, sweet potatoes, lemons, broccoli, limes and tomatoes are all good sources of the essential vitamin.

An inquest into Dylan's death has been opened and adjourned.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
