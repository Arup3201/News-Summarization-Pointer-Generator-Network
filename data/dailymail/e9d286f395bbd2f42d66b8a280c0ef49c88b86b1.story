Team news

Leicester City 

Kasper Schmeichel may make his return for Leicester after four months out with a broken foot.

The goalkeeper has been in full training and is now fit enough for first-team action ahead of the visit of Hull, and boss Nigel Pearson must choose between him, Mark Schwarzer and Ben Hamer.

Dean Hammond (calf) and Anthony Knockaert (personal reasons) are out for Pearson's side, though, with the Foxes bottom of the Barclays Premier League.

Provisional squad: Schmeichel, Schwarzer, Hamer, Moore, Konchesky, De Laet, Simpson, Upson, Wasilewski, Morgan, Schlupp, Mahrez, Drinkwater, James, King, Cambiasso, Albrighton, Vardy, Nugent, Ulloa, Kramaric.
