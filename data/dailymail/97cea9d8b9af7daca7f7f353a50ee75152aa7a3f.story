With 14 Oscar nominations between them, Dame Judi Dench and Dustin Hoffman were always destined to impress in the BBC’s production of Esio Trot.

But James Corden had a harder time winning over audiences when the Roald Dahl adaptation was broadcast on BBC One last night.

The high-profile production was released with great fanfare and quickly became the top trending topic on Twitter in the UK.

While many praised the quality of BBC1's adaptation of Esio Trot, hundreds of disgruntled viewers took to Twitter to blast actor James Corden’s (pictured) narration, branding it ‘awful’

But while many praised the quality of the programme, hundreds of disgruntled viewers blasted Corden’s narration, branding it ‘awful’. 

One wrote that Dahl would be ‘spinning in his grave’ to see what the Gavin and Stacey star had done to his best-selling children’s book.

Esio Trot tells the story of Dustin Hoffman’s shy bachelor Mr Hoppy, who is secretly in love with his neighbour Mrs Silver, played by Judi Dench. 

Mr Hoppy’s attempts to talk to her end in disaster, especially as she lavishes all her attention on her pet tortoise.

Corden, 36, who has just been awarded an OBE in the New Year’s Honours list, was brought in to narrate the piece but The Wrong Mans star failed to strike the right tone for viewers.

One commented on Twitter: ‘Esio Trot is being ruined for me by James Corden’s God-awful narration.’ 

Another added: ‘Esio Trot beautifully done and warming so far but James Corden? Not needed when you have two amazing actors on screen!’

Others criticised the adaptation, which was co-written by Blackadder scribe Richard Curtis, for changing the book too much, particularly its use of language. 

One wrote: ‘James Corden calling Mr Hoppy “The Hopster” just made me want to end it all’, while others tweeted BBC One to ask: ‘Why change a perfect book?’ 

The BBC did not respond to requests for comment.
