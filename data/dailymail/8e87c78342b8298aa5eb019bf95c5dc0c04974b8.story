A couple who first met when they were just five years old have finally married some 65 years later in a romance that rivals that of TV drama Last Tango in Halifax.

Like the plot lines of the BBC show starring Derek Jacobi and Anne Reid, life tore Colin Stevens and Patricia Higgs apart before fate brought them back together. Their love story was even sealed with a wedding in Halifax.

Colin Stevens and Patricia Higgs met on their first day of school at St Mary's RC Primary School in Bradford, West Yorkshire, in 1949. For Colin it was infatuation at first sight.

Colin Stevens and Patricia Higgs love story has been compared to that of Derek Jacobi and Anne Reid in Last Tango in Halifax, right; the pair met when they were five, but it wasn't until this year that they married

Colin and Patrica got married this year in Halifax; having first met in 1949, the couple didn't see each other again until 1986 when fate brought them back together

He recalls being so scared he 'felt like crying'. Then he noticed his wife-to-be, a wee girl in a blue dress with flowers on it, 'the prettiest thing I'd ever seen'.

Throughout his years at the school his feelings never waned and 11 Colin and Patricia moved to the same comprehensive school.

Boys and girls were separated for lessons, but the pair found each other in the school's playground and with other friends they hung out in the streets together after class.

As Colin got older his feeling got stronger and eventually he was bold enough to make a move. As teenagers they enjoyed their first kiss at Patricia's house.

At 15 Colin asked Patricia out, but they only managed one date before fate drove them apart for several decades.  Patricia's family moved to Halifax, something that happened so quickly the lovebirds never even had a chance to say goodbye or swap addresses.

Colin said it was love at first sight when he met Patricia on the first day at school at St Mary's RC Primary School in Bradford, West Yorkshire in 1949; he said he was so scared he 'wanted to cry', then he saw her

After going their separate ways as teenagers Colin began working in showbusiness; he married twice and had two children before divorcing; Patricia married and had five sons

In the following years Colin and Patricia built very separate lives away from each other. 

Colin, living in Essex and working in showbusiness, married twice and had two children before divorcing. Patricia also married and had five sons. When one of them died, her marriage also fell apart.

In 1986, when Colin returned to Bradford for his daughter's wedding, a chance conversation led to him being put back in touch with Patricia. 

A woman recognised him and asked if he attended the same school as her niece. As chance would have it, that relative was his one true love.

Colin told her he was meeting old school friends at a bar later, and while reminiscing with them the phone in the pub rang. It was for him, and like his first meeting with Patricia age five, it was something Colin will never forget.

The person on the phone was Patricia. 

 'I couldn't believe it. We ­arranged to meet the next day. We hadn't seen or spoken to each other for years but when I saw her again, my heart skipped a beat. She'd scarcely changed. She was just as beautiful and bubbly as ever, ' Colin told the Sunday People.

The pair went for a drive and soon realised that the spark between them was still very much alive. But although Patricia was finally single, Colin was in a relationship and living in Essex.

The pair agreed to keep in touch, but Patricia was soon in another relationship.

In 2005, Colin's son Stephen died aged 41, and he reached out to Patricia for support. She was there again in 2012 when he was diagnosed with cancer.  

Patricia said: 'Like TV's Celia and Alan, we were childhood ­sweethearts. Like them, we are ­together again and ­determined to make the most of it'

It was after Colin attended his daughter's wedding in 1986 and Patricia's aunt recognised him that the pair got back in touch for the first time in almost 30 years

Colin and Patricia finally got together after Colin beat cancer in 2013; after visiting his long lost love with champagne Colin stayed the night and in the morning they confessed their long-standing love for each other

 'When I told Patricia, I could hear the ­devastation in her voice,' Colin said.

A year later, now in remission, Colin visited Patricia with two bottles of champagne. They planned to go out for dinner, but later cancelled the reservation.

Colin assumed he would stay in the spare room, but Patricia had other ideas.  

Patricia told the newspaper: 'I came right out and told him, 'If you think you're sleeping in there, you've got another thing coming. I've waited 60-odd years for you and I'm not waiting any longer!'

The following day Patricia told Colin she had loved him since 'we were five'. Colin said, 'me too'.

In May the pair married in Halifax.   

Patricia said: 'Like TV's Celia and Alan, we were childhood ­sweethearts. Like them, we are ­together again and ­determined to make the most of it.' 

Colin added: 'We are incredibly happy. Patricia's son Jason teases us, saying it's a slow waltz in Halifax, not a tango. But the long wait means we cherish what we have.'
