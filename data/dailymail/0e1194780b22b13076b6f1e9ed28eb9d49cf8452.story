Legend: Lollobrigida was once dubbed 'the most beautiful woman in the world'

Hollywood legend Gina Lollobrigida has hit out at her only son after the pair were locked in a ‘horrendous’ legal fight over her £30 million fortune.

Andrea Milko Skofic, 56, Miss Lollobrigida’s only son and heir, had asked a court in Rome to appoint a judge to oversee her wealth amid claims that she had been duped into marrying Spaniard Javier

Rigau y Rafols, a businessman 34 years her junior. Mr Skofic claimed his mother had become ‘unable to think for herself’.

But the Sixties’ screen siren, who starred in films including Trapeze and The Hunchback Of Notre Dame, labelled her son’s legal battle a ‘dirty, ugly business’.

Miss Lollobrigida, 87, said: ‘I’m speechless that my son could consider taking this to court. 

'I’m delighted the request was dismissed but I would have preferred it if none of this had ever come to court.’

The actress met Rafols at a party in Monte Carlo in the 1980s. 

The couple became companions and they were set to marry in 2006 but Miss Lollobrigida says she changed her mind before the ceremony could go ahead. 

Meanwhile, Rafols, who insists the wedding did take place, faces fraud allegations in Spain and Italy.

Miss Lollobrigida said Rafols had ‘caused her evil’ and added: ‘I was taken by him but that’s because we artists are always flying in the clouds.’

Earlier this week, her lawyers, Fabrizio Siggia e Massimo Bersani, said the case has additionally damaged the image
 of Ms Lollobrigida because of the pre-emptive media coverage, they 
said.

The actress, known for
 her rivalry with fellow Italian Sophia Loren, made headlines the world 
over last year when she claimed that her former boyfriend paid an 
impersonator to stand in for her at a proxy wedding in Spain in 2010.

Ms
 Lollobrigida first met Spanish businessman Javier Rigau y Rafols, 43 
years her junior, at a party in Monte Carlo in the 1980s.

The couple 
became companions and planned to marry in 2006 but Miss Lollobrigida 
changed her mind before the ceremony could take place.

The
 former sex symbol, who acted with Burt Lancaster and Humphrey Bogart, 
said she had no knowledge of her 2010 wedding to Mr Rafols and would 
never have agreed to it.

She only discovered it by chance on the 
internet with the help of her young male manager, Andrea Piazzolla.

She
 told the Daily Mail last year: 'I knew nothing about this until I did 
some research on the internet. He invented a false document to carry out
 this wedding and now he will pay.

'I will not rest until he has been 
brought to justice. He is nothing but a vulture, circling me, sniffing 
my blood. He married me and was waiting for me to die so he could 
inherit my possessions.'

But Rafols claimed the marriage was ‘completely legitimate,’ and witnessed by eight people.
