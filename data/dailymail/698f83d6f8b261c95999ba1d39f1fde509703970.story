It is the most glamorous weekend in Dubai’s social calendar and the ladies were out in force today in an array of outrageous hats and bright dresses that would give the fashionistas at Ascot a run for their money.

With a highly anticipated fashion competition taking place behind the scenes, the stakes were just as high for the stylish women in the crowd at the Dubai World Cup as those racing for glory.

Around  50,000 revellers attended the world's richest horse race at Meydan this year, with many hoping to be considered for the off-track prizes including best dressed lady and man, best dressed couple, best hat, most creative hat and Longines most elegant lady.

The race produced an unexpected winner with Prince Bishop, an eight-year-old trained by Saeed bin Suroor, which pulled away from race favorite California Chrome on the home straight to win the race by two and three-quarter lengths.

Kylie Minogue is set to close the event tonight which saw a total prize money of £20million handed out - including £6.7million for the winner.
