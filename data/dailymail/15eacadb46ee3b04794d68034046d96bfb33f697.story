Toronto Mayor Rob Ford is taking a leave of absence and pausing his re-election campaign to treat his alcoholism.

Ford's step away from the mayor's office 
follows the emergence of a new video allegedly showing him smoking crack in the early hours of Saturday at his sister's home. 

The controversial mayor issued a statement late on Wednesday, saying that he has decided to 'seek immediate help' and is '100 per cent committed to getting myself right'.

The video emerged after Ford was allegedly seen on Monday night getting drunk at a Toronto bar and making lewd comments about a female political opponent

A self-professed drug dealer began 
marketing three videos allegedly showing Ford smoking crack in his 
sister's house on Saturday, which he is trying to sell for 'at least six
 figures'.

On Thursday, Doug Ford, the brother and campaign manager of Ford, made an impassioned plea on his behalf.

Choking back tears, Doug Ford said at a press conference: 'I’ll continue to stand by my brother and his family throughout this difficult journey.'

Doug Ford has in the past defiantly defended his brother when reports of crack-smoking surfaced. Today he admitted: 'This is one of the toughest days of my life.'

He said: 'In saying that, I also have a sense of relief. As an older brother, I 
am relieved that Rob has faced his problems and has decided to seek 
professional help. This is not an easy thing for anyone to do especially
 when you're the mayor of this city.'

He added: 'Rob was very emotional when he told me the hardest thing about this is he knows he let people down.'

The mayor first 
grabbed international attention last year when a group tried selling 
another video showing the mayor smoking crack.

A solemn Mayor Rob Ford leaves his home early this morning in Toronto. Ford will take an immediate leave of absence to seek help for alcohol, he said, as a report surfaced about a second video of the mayor smoking what appears to be crack cocaine

While
 that video was never released to the public, Toronto Police say they 
have a copy of it and Mayor Ford eventually copped to smoking the 
substance in a 'drunken stupor'.

A dealer says he took the latest video last Saturday around 1.15am in Kathy Ford's basement.

Globe and Mail
 reporters were shown clips of the videos on Wednesday and report that 
it shows a man who appears to be the mayor 'taking a drag from a long 
copper-colored pipe, exhaling a cloud of smoke, his right arm 
convulsing'.

Also shown in the video is a man who 
looks like Alessandro 'Sandro' Lisi, the mayor's former driver and who 
has been accused of being a drug-dealing extortionist.

The mayor's sister Kathy is also allegedly seen in the clips, sitting in front of her brother.

In the third clip, Mr Ford speaks to her while holding a pipe.

Gawker was also approached about the tape, and published screens shots of the clips. The dealer told the outlet that the Globe and Mail had purchased stills of the video for $10,000. 

It's been an eventful week for Ford, who 
was also secretly recorded getting drunk in Toronto bar Sullie Gorman's 
Monday night, making lewd comments about mayoral competition Karen 
Stintz.

'I’d like to f****g jam her (Stintz), but she doesn’t want ... I can’t talk like this ... I’m so sorry,' Ford says in the recording obtained by the Toronto Sun. 'I forgot there’s a woman in the house.'

The mayor can also be heard on the recording talking about the gay pride rainbow flag which is raised at Toronto's City Hall.

He said: 'They put this f****** flag up ahead of our Canadian flag, I said, ''No, I’m sorry. Bulls***'''.

He later adds that he is 'so f***** sick of politics'.

Witnesses also told the Sun that Ford ordered shooters, tried to fight other patrons and was just generally 'acting like a real a**'.

A bartender at the restaurant, which is located near Ford's mother's house, said the mayor was 'in fine form'.

Ford was noticeably absent from city hall the next day.

Public display: The announcement comes just two days after the mayor was recorded getting drunk at Toronto bar Sullie Gorman's where witnesses say he was in 'fine form'

Tonight, I want to take some time to speak from my heart to the people of Toronto.  It’s not easy to be vulnerable, and this is one of the most difficult times in my life.

I have a problem with alcohol and the choices I have made while under the influence. I have struggled with this for some time.

Today, after taking some time to think about my own well-being, how to best serve the people of Toronto and what is in the best interests of my family, I have decided to take a leave from campaigning and from my duties as mayor to seek immediate help.

I have tried to deal with these issues by myself over the past year.  I know that I need professional help, and I am now 100 per cent committed to getting myself right.

I love the people of Toronto, I love being your mayor and I hope you will continue to stand by me. 

With the support of my family, friends, professionals and the people of Toronto, I will conquer this. Please keep me and my family in your prayers during these difficult days ahead. 

I just want to say to the people of Toronto that I thank you for your ongoing support and encouragement.  I cannot tell you enough how much I appreciate it.
