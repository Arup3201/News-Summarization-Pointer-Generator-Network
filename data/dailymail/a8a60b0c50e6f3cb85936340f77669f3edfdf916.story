A teenager from Cardiff and a man from London have been arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences today.

The 18-year-old is from the Grangetown area of Cardiff - close to inner city areas of the Welsh capital where a trio of young jihadists now fighting for ISIS lived before they fled to Syria.

He was seized under Section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006 for assisting in the preparation of an act of terrorism.

Cardiff link: Britons Reyaad Khan and Nasser Muthana appeared in this Isis recruitment video this month encouraging others to fight jihad as two men were arrested by anti-terror police today

Police sources say the arrest is not directly connected to the three Cardiff men currently in Syria.

Meanwhile a 32-year-old has been arrested on suspicion of terrorism and fraud and 12 addresses are being searched as part of an investigation linked to Syria.

Officers from Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism unit held the man today in west London and he is currently being questioned at a police station in the south of the capital.

He was arrested on suspicion of fraud by false representation and arranging funding for terrorism in Syria. Police said that 12 addresses are being searched - one in Hertfordshire and the rest in west London.

Concerns have been raised for several months about the number of would-be British jihadis who are travelling to the war-torn Middle Eastern state.

Counter-terrorism police launched a campaign earlier this year to encourage women to inform on male relatives who they suspect of planning to travel to Syria to get involved in fighting. 

The issue again reared its head when Aseel Muthana, 17, followed his older sibling Nasser, 20, from Cardiff to join Isis in Syria.

Young recruit: 17-year-old Aseel Muthana was allegedly a member of a violent Cardiff gang before he fled to join his brother Nasser fighting for Isis in Syria   

Another friend Reyaad Khan, also from the city, appeared in a shocking recruitment video aimed at luring jihadists to Syria and Iraq. 

In February Aseel fled Britain to fight in Syria after telling his parents he was staying at his friend's house ahead of a maths exam at his school.

But police then arrived at his home the following night after it emerged he had gained a second passport by lying about his age and was in Cyprus and about to sail to Syria.

His brother Nasser was a star medical student who secretly travelled to Syria from his family home in Cardiff despite being offered the opportunity to study medicine by four universities.

His family have not seen him since November 2013.

Furious father Ahmed Muthana, 57, said if his sons ever return to the UK, he would like to see them jailed.

He says the Welsh capital is facing a crisis with extremists leafleting communities and holding 'pop-up' events to groom young men.
