David Haye has stepped up his training as he prepares to return to the ring.

The former heavyweight world champion confirmed last weekend that he would fight this autumn, more than two years after he stopped Dereck Chisora at Upton Park.

And the 33-year-old has also posted video clips of his training regime on Instagram.Â

Haye can be seen performing pull-ups, dips and punching the speed bag in his Vauxhall gym.

On Saturday he told iFL TV: 'I'll have nights in the future to talk about. If I was a betting man, I'd bet that I'll fight in September or October.'

The Londoner was at Wembley on Saturday night to see his friend Carl Froch knock out his former training partner George Groves in front of 80,000 fans.

Haye twice pulled out of a clash with fellow British heavyweight Tyson Fury last year, first with a cut suffered in sparring and then after rupturing tendons in his shoulder.

A five-hour operation last November looked set to bring down the curtain on his illustrious career but Haye has gradually stepped up his training.

And last week, his trainer and manager Adam Booth confirmed a comeback was imminent.

Speaking to the Daily Express, he said: 'It's true, 100 per cent true, David is coming back.

'We will not be making any big announcement but David has been given the all clear by his medical people and he wants to fight again.

'We plan to get back in the ring before the end of the year and preferably by October.

'David has started training and there is no need to keep this a secret any longer. He has been trying to recuperate for five and a half months and only now has he been given the all clear to fight again.'

Haye will have one eye on the second of this year's British grudge rematches when Fury takes on Chisora at the Manchester Arena in July.

The pair first met in 2011 with Fury winning a unanimous decision over an overweight and unfit Chisora at Wembley Arena.

The winner in Manchester will be installed as the mandatory challenger to world champion Wladimir Klitschko and it is unlikely that either man would risk that position for a fight with Haye.

Another option for the former unified cruiserweight world champion is Bermane Stiverne who won the vacant WBC title after Vitali Klitschko's decision to retire.

Stiverne beat Chris Arreola last month but has his own mandatory due against knockout sensation Deontay Wilder, a former sparring partner of Haye.

The American has stopped each of his 31 opponents and is yet to go beyond the fourth round as a professional.
