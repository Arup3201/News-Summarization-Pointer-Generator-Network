A bid to free Guantanamo Bay inmate Shaker Aamer (pictured) faces further delay after US officials launched yet another review

A bid to free Guantanamo Bay inmate Shaker Aamer faces further delay after US officials launched yet another review, it was revealed last night.

Even though the 48-year-old detainee from London has already been cleared for release twice by the US, a minister told the Commons his ‘complex case’ was being studied again by six federal agencies including CIA chiefs.

The admission by Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood fuelled fears that the father of four could continue to be held indefinitely in the military jail, where he has already languished for 13 years without charge or trial.

Mr Ellwood said there was ‘no timetable’ for the decision by US officials but he said they were determined to make sure the captive was ‘not going to be a danger to this or any other country’.

Mr Aamer’s plight was raised during an impassioned Commons debate by MPs of all parties pressing for the freedom of the last British resident at the camp.

Former Tory minister David Davis called Britain and the US’s handling of Mr Aamer’s case ‘immoral’. Lib Dem Tim Farron said there was ‘no excuse’ why the detainee should not be freed and said the US’s behaviour was like that of an ‘extremist regime’. 

He insisted the West had ‘fallen short’ of the standards millions of people had died to protect in the 20th Century and said its behaviour in setting up the torture camp was ‘exactly what Al Qaeda would have liked us to have done’.

Politicians from all parties lined up to launch blistering attacks on the White House for failing to keep its promise to free the terror suspect, who lived in South London with his wife and children.

They pressed ministers to explain why Saudi-born Mr Aamer had not been handed over despite being twice cleared for release – once by the Bush administration in 2007 and again by Barack Obama in 2009.

The detainee’s supporters claim the intention is to silence him because he was tortured in Guantanamo and Afghanistan, including being beaten, waterboarded, shackled and threatened with execution.

The abuse of Mr Aamer, said to have been a key aide of Osama bin Laden – a claim he vehemently denied – is alleged to have been witnessed by a British security official.

Labour MP John McDonnell said 33 prisoners had been released last year to countries including Uruguay and Kazakhstan. ‘It is hard to understand why the US finds the transfer to the UK almost impossible,’ he said.

‘The question we are all asking is why is Shaker still being detained. Is it that Shaker knows too much about what happened in Guantanamo and would ensure the truth comes out if he was released.

‘Or is it because he can bear witness not just to the US involvement in illegal criminal torture but also to UK involvement?’

He called for a ‘full and thorough independent inquiry’ into the detainee’s evidence about alleged collusion in torture by British intelligence officers.

In a statement, Mr McDonnell said: ‘It is absolutely unacceptable that an innocent man continues to be to be subjected to inhumane and degrading treatment in absolute denial of his human rights remains in Guantanamo.

‘The continued incarceration of Shaker Aamer on US territory, without charge and against who unspeakable atrocities have been committed shames both our Governments and is an international outrage.’

Liberal Democrat Tim Farron said there was ‘no excuse’ why Mr Aamer should not be released. He said the US’s behaviour was equivalent to that ‘of an extremist regime’.

Labour MP Gerald Kaufman said: ‘If Islamic State had a camp where they interned illegally for years without charge people innocent or guilty, in which torture, solitary confinement and inhuman treatment were daily occurrences, we would regard it as savagery.’

MPs want Mr Aamer - who was granted leave to remain in the UK in 1996 - to be returned home urgently due to his deteriorating health.

Mr Aamer moved to London almost 20 years ago and married, securing leave to remain in Britain. But in 2001, he was detained in Kabul while carrying out peaceful voluntary work for an Islamic charity, his representatives claim.

He was handed to the US military for $5,000 and tortured at a secret ‘black site’ prison. US intelligence agents insisted he financed Al Qaeda and was.

He was sent to Guantanamo Bay in February 2002. Despite being cleared for release, US officials are determined he is sent to Saudi Arabia, despite serious concerns he will face torture.

The current impasse is embarrassing for Prime Minister David Cameron who said President Barack Obama had vowed to ‘prioritise’ the detainee’s release from Guantanamo after White House talks in January.

Foreign Office Minister Tobias Ellwood said there was ‘no timetable’ for the six US agencies, which include the CIA and Defense Department, making a decision on his release.

He refused to explain why the US was holding up Mr Aamer’s release, insisting he could not comment on ‘intelligence’ matters.

But he said the US were determined to make sure the captive was ‘not going to be a danger to this or any other country’.

Mr Ellwood added: ‘We continue to raise his case at the highest levels in the US and impress further upon our counterparts the urgency surrounding this.’
