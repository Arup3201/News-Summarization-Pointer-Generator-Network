For anyone that thought space was dark and colourless, the latest images from the Hubble Space Telescope may come as an eye-opener.

The show the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way nearly 200,000 light-years from Earth.

Vast clouds of gas within it slowly collapse to form new stars, which light up the gas clouds in a riot of colours, as revealed in this image from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope.

The image shows the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is ablaze with star-forming regions.

'The LMC is in an ideal position for astronomers to study the phenomena surrounding star formation,' the European Space Observatory said.

'It lies in a fortuitous location in the sky, far enough from the plane of the Milky Way that it is neither outshone by too many nearby stars, nor obscured by the dust in the Milky Way's centre.

'It is also close enough to study in detail (less than a tenth of the distance of the Andromeda Galaxy, the closest spiral galaxy), and lies almost face-on to us, giving us a bird's eye view.'

LHA 120-N 11 (known as N11 for short) is a particularly bright region of the LMC, consisting of several adjacent pockets of gas and star formation.

The data in this image were identified by Josh Lake, an astronomy teacher at Pomfret School in Connecticut, USA, in the Hubble's 'Hidden Treasures' image processing competition.

The competition invited members of the 
public to dig out unreleased scientific data from Hubble's vast archive,
and to process them into stunning images.
