A couple who were reunited after 20 years apart were torn apart again after a near fatal road accident turned their lives upside down.

Chrissie and her husband Tim had been engaged to be married two decades ago before Chrissie got cold feet and ended the engagement and the two lost touch for 20 years.

Four years ago they were to be reunited when Chrissie, looking for closure, wrote a letter to Tim. They fell in love all over again and quickly married. But while the couple were delighted to be reunited, their road to happiness was not to be a smooth one.

Just four years after their emotional reunion, Chrissie endured a horrific road accident that left her with a severe head injury fighting for her life in intensive care.

Chrissie and Tim were apart for 20 years after calling off their engagement, but reunited four years ago

The tragic incident featured in last night's episode of award-winning C4 documentary series 24 Hours In A&E.

Filmed at Kings 
College Hospital in London following the accident, it was revealed that 47-year-old Chrissie, who works as a secretary in an investment bank, was crossing a road 500 metres from her home in London when she was knocked down by a motorcyclist.

The left side of Chrissie's face took the force of the impact, and she suffered a concussion as well as totally shattering her left eye socket.

She fractured the lateral, medial, posterior and inferior wall of her left eye socket when the motorbike hit her.

At the hospital she was found to have suffered a concussion from the impact to her 
head, and remained confused and disorientated during her treatment. 

As soon as Tim hears Chrissie has been injured, he rushes to hospital to be with her - but ironically gets stuck in the very traffic jam caused by Chrissie's accident.

Once there, he can be seen sitting diligently by his wife’s side, 
holding her hand and comforting her in heart-warming scenes that sum up 
this extraordinary couple's journey.

Recalling their rocky road to romance
Tim, who works as a driver for a fashion company, says: ‘It was 20-odd 
years ago, we started going out together.

‘We
didn't work in the same office, but on the same floor. I'm 
pretty certain it was almost love at first sight, sounds a bit corny, 
doesn't it, but there was an instant attraction, that sort of warmth of 
her face and the glow that she seemed to give off.

‘And
within a matter of weeks I'd sort of proposed to her and said, "Well, 
you know, why don't we sort of make a go, you know, a proper go of 
things and get married?"’

Despite
agreeing to marry after such a brief romance, Chrissie, then aged just 21,
had second thoughts about the union as the wedding day drew near.

Chrissie says: ‘I met Tim when I was 21. He was just very, very good-looking and it was just wow, and we were engaged within two weeks.

‘Three weeks before the wedding I turned around to him and said, "Sorry, don't want to marry you."

‘To Tim because I said those words, 'I don't want to marry you', he just sort of switched off.

'For me I thought he was just moving out to think and get himself together and that he was going to come back and then we'd have a talk about it, but he never did.’

The couple had no contact for over 20 years after their split, and never discussed the end of the relationship.

Tim says it was love at first sight when he first met Chrissie, and he asked her to marry him within a few weeks of dating

Then four years ago Chrissie decided to get back into contact with Tim.

‘I wrote to him and I said: "Would you want to get in touch so we could just sort of have some closure? Because you just disappeared and there was no closure. For me it just was left hanging for over 20 years,"’ Chrissie says.

For Tim, in spite of the relationship's hurtful end, the letter offered a chance to rekindle their special bond.

‘There was this letter in front of me from a person I'd really loved and felt such a great bond with and yet, while things went wrong at the time, there were still those feelings there.

Chrissie badly damaged her eye socket in the accident

‘I actually sat on that letter for about a month thinking about things until I just got to the point where I thought well, what have I got to lose,’ he says.

After meeting up the couple decided to make the long-awaited wedding happen. Chrissie says: 'We finally made it down the aisle and it was very special second time round. 

'We were older, wiser and much more appreciative of things. 

'We got married in jeans and T-shirt with a friend of his from work and his mother, just two witnesses as it was our special moment.'

With their love renewed, a besotted Tim hardly left Chrissie's side when she was in King's undergoing treatment for the horrific facial injuries she endured.

And when Chrissie was finally well enough to leave King's, Tim was there to help his wife home.

Chrissie is still recovering from her injuries and undergoing extensive physiotherapy but hopes to return to work soon.
