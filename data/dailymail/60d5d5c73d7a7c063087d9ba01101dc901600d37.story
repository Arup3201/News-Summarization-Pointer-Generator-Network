After scoring a hat-trick for Barcelona during their Spanish league  victory over Espanyol on Sunday, Lionel Messi started to get ready for Christmas with his family.

Messi's girlfriend, Antonella Roccuzzo, uploaded a picture on Instagram of the couple with their young son Thiago, with the caption 'waiting for Santa Claus with my loves'.

The 27-year-old Argentina international Messi had earlier fired in three goals for Barcelona as they remained two points behind La Liga leaders Real Madrid.

His treble, netted on the same weekend Cristiano Ronaldo set a La Liga record of 23 hat-tricks, saw Messi pass 400 for Barcelona and it was the 29th time in all competitions he has scored three times in a game.

Next in Messi's sights will be surpassing the figure of 31 hat-tricks in all competitions set by Telmo Zarra of Athletic Bilbao.

And Messi broke Zarra's La Liga scoring record of 251 goals last month - with another hat-trick.
