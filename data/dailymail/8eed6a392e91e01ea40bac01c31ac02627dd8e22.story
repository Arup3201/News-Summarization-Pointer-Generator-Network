Australian actress Cate Blanchett, 45, has opened her beauty bag for FEMAIL and shared the secrets behind her timeless look as she poses in her new beauty campaign

Speaking about the peculiar lotion, she said: 'I tend to use really basic creams, and I like to put anoil on, like an emu oil from Australia. It’s from the emu and it’s really nourishing. I prefer an oil to a cream.' 

‘In indigenous Australian culture, that’s the first oil they put on a baby because it’s so hydrating,’ she also told Refinery 29. ‘It’s all pretty basic.’

The product is made from oil taken from the fatty tissue on an emu's back and has been used by Aborigines for thousands of years for its powerful soothing properties.

It is thought to be a natural anti-inflammatory. A study at Victoria University in Melbourne showed a significant reduction in pain in subjects with osteoarthritis in their hands with either application or ingestion of emu oil.

The Hollywood stalwart says she's picked up some vital beauty habits from her years in the industry and has been using SK-II products, for which she is the face of, for 13 years

Cate swears by it for treating scars and sunburn and Oprah Winfrey, Charlize Theron, Beyonce, Demi Moore and even Zac Efron are also reported fans. 

Cate, who is the ambassador for beauty brand SK-II, shared her day-to-day skincare tips.

She said: 'I drink hot water with lemon. Everyone says, “Try this” or “Try that”, but they all come back to basic principles. They all come back to hydrating, drinking enough water and making sure you don’t eat over-processed food.

'The other thing that’s really bad for your gut and skin, and really bad for your mind, is stress levels. Anything you can do to reduce your stress levels - which is hard if you’re under economic pressure or in relationship pressure - those things take a toll on you and your skin. 

'But anything you could do to ease that part of your life will have an impact. How you feel affects how you look.'

The Hollywood stalwart, who has won countless awards, says she's picked up some vital beauty habits from her years in the industry.

She swears by not overplucking her eyebrows, and when it comes to make-up, finding the right foundation that works with her moisturiser is essential, she says.

'I’ve gotten very quick and easy about [my beauty regime]. I don’t think about it a lot. I don’t wear a lot of makeup during my everyday life - I would for a character - but it’s all about making sure your skin is clean.

'For me, the thing I’ll never give up is my skincare. I’ve also learnt how highlighting can change your face. I’m also not faddish about it, so it hasn’t really changed that much to be honest. I use the SK-II LXP Ultimate Perfecting Essence, Serum and Cream and I cleanse, and I get up and do the same thing,' she said.

The blonde beauty also opened up about ageing gracefully, admitting: 'Whenever I have those days - and we all have them - and I go “Oh, I don’t like this bit or that bit”, I always have to ask myself what it is and that’s what I have to work on.

'We’re all getting older, there’s no point panicking about it, you just try to look as good as you can at whatever age you are.'

Cate revealed that working out and meditating more will be at the top of her priorities list this month

She continued: 'I really subscribe to the Asian philosophy that in order for something to be perfect, it needs to contain its grain of imperfection. 

'In Japan for instance, when a plate breaks, they’ll put it back together but they’ll put gold along the cracks – they’ll celebrate the crack. Whereas in the West, I feel like we’re always trying to pretend the crack’s not there or throw it away and get another one.

'I think we should throw out the notion of trying to attain all that perfection that isn’t possible. We should try to be better but we should celebrate who we are and what we have. I certainly wasn’t born with incredible skin but I worked with what I’d been given.'

Discussing her New Year's resolutions, she revealed that working out is at the top of her priorities list. 

'I’m so regular with my skincare, so I’d love to get regular with my exercise too because it always goes out the window,' she said.

'If I don’t do something in the morning then I don’t get it done because then the day takes over. And often it does take over for one thing or another.

'I’ve so many friends who have incorporated the idea of meditating at some point during the day, so I would love that. There’re so many apps now and the world can get so noisy; we’re so addicted to being busy. I would really love to find that 15 minutes a day to just be still and quiet.'

It seems that Cate may find it difficult to find some downtime  over the coming months thanks to her new movie role alongside Helena Bonham Carter.

Helena, 48, who recently split from her director husband, Tim Burton, plays the kooky Fairy Godmother in Cinderalla, while Cate plays the menacing evil stepmother.

In the recently released international trailer for the movie, Bonham Carter, armed with a pumpkin and a few mice, swaps her trademark black curls for a bright blonde hairdo while Blanchett is transforms into a redhead.

Blanchett taps into her sinister side as she's transformed into the stepmother, following in the footsteps of fellow wicked queens Charlize Theron and Julia Roberts.

The mother-of-two is the picture of nonchalant villainy as she is seen scouring at any given opportunity alongside the ugly stepsisters Anastasia and Drizella, played by English actress Holliday Grainger and Downton Abbey star Sophie McShera.

Kenneth Branagh directs the recreation which will hit theatres on March 13, 2015.
