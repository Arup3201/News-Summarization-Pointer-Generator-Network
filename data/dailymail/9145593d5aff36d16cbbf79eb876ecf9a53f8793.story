Eight cavers were today missing inside a maze of Alpine tunnels and underground waterways likened to Hell.

The men set off on Monday lunchtime to explore the Cuves de Sassenage, near the eastern French city of Grenoble.

They were due back at midnight, but when they failed to return an emergency operation was launched by the local authorities.

Emergency services near the entrance to caves in the French Alps where eight people went missing today

This afternoon specialist teams were using sound detectors and other equipment to try and locate the party, whose names and nationalities have not been released.

The area is hugely popular with British tourists, including cavers and mountaineers, especially during the summer months.

Rescuers working around the cave entrances feared that flooding may have caused problems for the cavers.

A spokesman for the local Isere prefecture confirmed that an ‘emergency plan’ had been launched, and that rescuers were ‘at work’.

He said there was ‘extreme concern’ for the men’s safety.

He said all of the cavers were ‘highly experienced’, and had travelled to Sassenage, the nearest village to the caves, especially for the expedition.

Emergency: Eight cavers have gone missing in the Alpine tunnels known as the Cuves de Sassenage (pictured)

Many parts of the limestone caves, which were fashioned by the underground river Germe over some 80 million years, are only accessibly through tiny gaps, which people have to squeeze through.

The Cuves, or cisterns, are named after two giant ‘cauldrons’ worn into the rock at the caves entrance – the so-called Hell Gallery and Tomb Alley.

Both are said to have inspired the Medieval Italian poet Dante in his description of Hell in the Divine Comedy.

A class of school children went missing in the same place in 2002, but were later rescued.

Cavers – or potholers as they are traditionally known in the UK – are encouraged to carry a range of equipment, including first aid kits and emergency supplies.
