A Boston College professor says he used Kobe Bryant as an example in his first international marketing class of the semester - and then the Lakers star walked into the class and started taking notes.

Boston College says Bryant arrived shortly after the class began Thursday night and stayed for two hours until it was over.

Professor Nick Nugent says Bryant's visit was not planned.

Bryant told students that he loves to learn and is interested in international marketing.

He was in the area for the Lakers' Friday night game against the Celtics, but did not play as he recovers from a left knee fracture.

Bryant did not attend college after going to the NBA directly from high school in suburban Philadelphia.

At 35-years-old, he is an 18-year basketball veteran.

Bryant recently said he has no intention of sitting out the rest of the season despite his injured knee.

He is waiting for a re-evaluation sometime in February.

'The only thing I can afford to consider is getting better, getting stronger,' Bryant told Fox News before Friday's game.

'I can't allow myself to think any other way.

Sidelined: Kobe Bryant has only played six games this season after tearing the Achilles tendon in his left leg in April

Disagreement: Former Lakers player Magic Johnson has weighed in on Kobe Byrant's injury, saying he should take a year off to recover and come back with a bang. Bryant disagrees

'I can only think about the next step.

'To do anything else becomes distracting if you allow yourself, if you give yourself wiggle room to not push yourself as hard as you possibly can.

'To think about sitting out and this, that and the other, your motivation is all wrong. I refuse to think that way.'

The comments come after for Lakers star Magic Johnson said Bryant should have a year off.

'What is he coming back to? He's not going to be able to stop the pick and roll, all the layups the Lakers are giving up,' Johnson told  the Los Angeles Times.

'He's been hurt twice, give him the whole year to get healthy.'

But Bryant is adamant that, if he gets medical clearance, he will be back on the court.

'We'll see where it's at in February and see if it's good to go,' he said.
