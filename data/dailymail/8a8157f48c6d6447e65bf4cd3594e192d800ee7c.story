An Indiana college student convicted of stabbing and shooting to death a classmate at Purdue University earlier this year has been found dead from an apparent suicide in his prison cell.

The Indiana Department of Correction said 24-year-old Cody Cousins was pronounced dead about 30 minutes after being found unresponsive Tuesday night at the Indiana State Prison with self-inflicted lacerations to his neck and arms.

An autopsy is still pending, but officials say it appears Cousins slashed himself with a razor, which inmates are allowed to keep for shaving purposes. His estimated release date was July 22, 2046. 

Grisly end: Cody Cousins, 24 (left), sentenced last month to 65 years in prison for the murder of 21-year-old Purdue University student Andrew Boldt (right), was found dead in his cell from cuts to his neck and arms 

Imprisoned: Cousins met his end at Indiana State Prison in Michigan City, where he arrived October 23 

Investigators said the Warsaw, Indiana, man entered a classroom filled with students on the West Lafayette campus January 21 and attacked Andrew Boldt, 21, of West Bend, Wisconsin. 

Boldt died after suffering five gunshot wounds, three of them to the face, and 19 cuts.

Dr Elmo Griggs, the veteran pathologist who examined Boldt's body, said of the crime: 'it was the worst homicide I have ever seen.'  

Both Cousins and Boldt were teaching assistants in Purdue's electrical engineering program at the time.

Cousins was sentenced September 19 to 65 years in prison after pleading guilty to murder. 

Defiant: Cousins told a judge during sentencing in September that he killed his classmate because he 'wanted to'

Chilling words: The 24-year-old man said in court he will deal 'with the consequences later'

During that hearing, Prosecutor Pat Harrington said Cousins, who had trouble keeping up in some classes and left Purdue at one point, envied Boldt, who was described as a top student. 

'Andrew was everything he was not,' Harrington said. 

During his sentencing last month, a defiant Cody Cousins admitted to the murder.

'I killed Andrew Boldt because I wanted to, and I do what I want to do,' he declared in court. 'I will deal with the consequences later.'

Defense attorneys argued that the 24-year-old was mentally ill at the time of the attack and asked that he receive treatment at once instead of upon his release from prison.

Attorney Kirk Freeman said during sentencing his client was 'so sick, he may not know he's sick.'

Experts who examined Cousins said he didn't show signs of mental illness the day Boldt was killed, and Cousins himself bragged to the judge last month that he lied to doctors about experiencing auditory hallucinations and had taken amphetamines.

Battling demons: Cousins' defense attorney insisted that his client was mentally ill 

On Wednesday, Cousins' attorney reiterated that his client had struggled with serious mental illness.

'It's a horrible, tragic end to this and I've expressed my condolences to his family,' Freeman said.

The Boldt family have not publicly commented about the death of Andrew's killer. The 21-year-old is survived by his parents and two brothers, Erich and Nathan.  

Indiana State Prison spokeswoman Pam James said Cousins arrived at the prison October 23 and had been given a single cell of the sort assigned to new inmates.

James said inmates in those cells are checked by staff every 30 minutes and prison logs indicate a correctional officer had last checked on Cousins at 8:.30 pm, about 25 minutes before he was found. She said Cousins had not been on suicide watch.

Cousins' death is being investigated by the Department of Correction's internal affairs office and the LaPorte County coroner's office.
