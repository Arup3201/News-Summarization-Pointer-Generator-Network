The Government tonight lost another vote in the House of Lords over its plans to shake-up the welfare system.

Peers rejected plans for a 'bedroom tax' on under-occupied council houses by a majority of 10.

The amended Bill will now have to be sent back to the House of Commons However, the Government are likely to stand-firm and overturn the changes.

It is the latest House of Lords defeat in the battle between the two houses over plans to cap benefits at £26,000 per year.

The plans will save the taxpayer £290million in 2013-14 and are designed to encourage benefit claimants to get back to work.

Under the draft legislation, people in council properties will lose £14 per week in state handouts for every spare room they have from next April.

Peers voted by 236 votes to 226 to exempt the disabled, war widows and foster carers from the proposed £14 cut.

Six Liberal Democrat rebels voted in favour of the amendment - in defiance of Government policy.

The exemptions - proposed by crossbench peer Lord Best - will cost around £100million.

Lord Best insisted his amendment 
would not remove the pressure on 'scroungers' who were able to work and 
was targeted at those who needed help.

He said: 'These are households for 
whom pressures to take a job, a key policy driver for the Government ...
 are not relevant. For these people the penalty simply represents a 
substantial loss of income with no escape.'

He added that it was unfair that people would face the benefits cut automatically from next April if no new properties are available - even if they are prepared to move.

He told the House of Lords: 'To suddenly impose the under occupation penalty on all these households before they have any chance to move elsewhere seems most unjust.'

He added: 'The new amendment confines the postponement of the imposition of the bedroom tax to certain categories only rather than to all tenants.

'I deeply regret abandoning hundreds of thousands of households, who even if this amendment is approved, will still be caught by the penalty charge on April 1 next year, even if they are willing to move, but are trapped where they are because there are no smaller flats available.

'However, needs must and the new amendment reduces the cost in the early years, from perhaps a maximum of £300million by around half, a far cry from the billions referred to in earlier debate.'

Labour's Baroness Hollis of Heigham backed Lord Best and said the Government's cuts were hitting the most vulnerable.

She told peers: 'Families with a 
disabled child can lose £14 a week while most of us enjoy a tax-free 
winter fuel allowance, or find for the second year running that our 
council tax has been frozen.

'Not a penny of these cuts are 
falling on me, and I suspect on very few of you, and yet we are asking 
disabled families and families with disabled children to carry those 
cuts for us.'

Shadow work and pensions secretary 
Liam Byrne said: 'The Lords voted today to protect war widows, carers 
and disabled people from having instant rent cuts and potentially 
becoming homeless.

'To propose the idea shows just how 
far this Government has now left basic decency behind. The Government 
attempted this desperate cut because they've let the unemployment bill 
spiral out of control.

'What they should focus on now is boosting the number of taxpayers by getting more people back into jobs.'

The Welfare Reform Bill has already endured a 
difficult time in the House of Lords, where peers have inflicted a series of 
defeats on ministers.

Earlier this month MPs threw out a series of changes made by peers.

The decision tonight to back Lord Best's amendment means the Welfare Reform Bill will now have to go back to the Commons again.

The latest round in the welfare reform battle protracted session of parliamentary 'ping
 pong' with the legislation being sent between the two chambers until 
agreement can be reached.
