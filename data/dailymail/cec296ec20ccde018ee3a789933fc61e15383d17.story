The mother of a 13-year-old boy who was left in intensive care with a serious head injury after a collision on the football field on Saturday has called an urgent meeting with his club and the National Rugby League after he was allowed to keep playing once he'd suffered a head knock.

Kellie Erwin said she had heard her son, Jarrod Fletcher, continued to play rugby league for Macarthur Saints after a head knock that left him 'concussed for one minute' and then later collapsed during the game at Campbelltown, in Sydney's south west, on Saturday.

He was rushed by air ambulance to the Children's Hospital at Westmead after he collapsed.

A spokesperson for Macarthur Saints has confirmed to MailOnline that the teen was 'never taken off the field at any stage'.

'What would have happened if he'd been tackled again?,' Ms Erwin said in an interview with MailOnline on Monday.

'In my eyes, why wasn't he taken off? He was still concussed for one minute.'

The distraught mother explained that she had been given various explanations about what happened to her son while he played for the junior team Macarthur Saints.

'I wasn't present on the day of the accident... I've heard many different stories,' she said.

'All I know is what people are telling me. Someone is telling me he got tackled and then he carried on playing and collapsed.

'I've been told stories there were two tackles and another said he had an elbow to his head.

'I've got to watch what I say because I wasn't there.'

Dianne Morrison, an official at Macarthur Saints JRLFC who saw the incident happen, confirmed that Jarrod was 'never taken off the field at any stage'.

'He was assessed on the field and got up and continued to play,' she said.

She admits that her teenage son might have acted like he was fine and put on a brave face after the head knock but she believes an adult should have stepped in.

'He might have said "I'm OK, I'm OK"... but a parent or an adult should have taken him off,' she said.

'That's the only thing I'm a bit disgusted in,' she added.

'It's still my son's life.'

Jarrod is still in intensive care at the Children's Hospital. A spokesperson told MailOnline on Monday that he was now in 'a satisfactory condition'.

Describing the moment she reached her injured son on the field, she said: 'It was like a massive crime scene, police, ambulance.'

She also praised the club for assisting her when she got there.

'The club did a wonderful job, they really assisted me and explained straight away... the ambulance put a sheet up and put him in an induced coma on the field.'

No one had any reason to suspect Jarrod had suffered a serious injury when the head knock happened.

His injury came just two days after 16-year-old Tyler Horton was forced to undergo brain surgery after being knocked unconscious when he was kneed in the head during a rugby league game at Bathurst.

Ms Erwin spoke about Tyler and other teens, such as Curtis Lander, who had been seriously injured during league games.

'I'm just the fortunate one,' she said.

The concerned mother called on the NRL to force players to wear headgear during games.

'My son has never worn headgear. I do believe it should be enforced.'

Curtis, who played for the Forster-Tuncurry Hawks on the NSW mid-north coast, was left paralysed by a horror tackle that fractured his c2 and c3 vertebrae. Club president Aaron Temple said he faced an uphill battled to recovery.

'He's looking at 12 months in hospital,' he told MailOnline.

Ms Erwin said that as young men they might not want to wear headgear as it's all about their 'image' but 'as a parent we should enforce it'.

'Over six years old, it should be compulsory,' she added.

'I believe it is time the NRL first graders wear head gear and lead an example.

'It may save your life.'

Western Suburbs Junior Rugby League chief executive, Julie Luke, told MailOnline: 'Following Jarrod's injury on Saturday, we have received reports from the key parties involved on the day. It appears to us on the basis of those preliminary reports that all of the officials acted appropriately.'

Ms Luke added: 'We'd like to correct two misconceptions. The incident was not as a result of any foul play; our own reports have confirmed it occurred as a result of an accidental collision.

'Jarrod was assessed and remained on the field after the collision. He did not leave the field of play.

'The sports trainer who treated Jarrod has a level one sports trainer accreditation as required at all junior rugby league matches and is appropriately qualified to assess such incidents.'

NSWRL chief executive David Trodden added: 'WSJRL chief executive Julie Luke, chairman Wayne Hardy Smith and I have collectively reviewed reports into Jarrod's injury and the aftermath. We will continue to look into what happened on the day.

'We're continuing to monitor Jarrod's recovery, which is our focus, and have also offered Jarrod and his family our full support. We're also offering officials and others involved on the day our support.'
