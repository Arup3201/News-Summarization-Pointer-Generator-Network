Click here to read the full report on McIlroy's race into the lead as Tiger Woods misses the cut at Valhalla. 

Rory McIlroy believes that splitting up from fiancé Caroline Wozniacki has played a key role in turning him into a world beater.

The brilliant Northern Irishman, seeking his third win in a row and second major championship victory in successive months following his triumph at The Open, leads at the halfway stage of the 96th USPGA Championship by a shot from Australian Jason Day after a second round 67.

It hardly seemed mere coincidence that since McIlroy and Wozniacki went their separate ways in late May, the former has won the flagship event on the European Tour plus the Open and his first World Golf Championship event. Now he leads yet another big tournament.

Asked once more why it had all gone right, this time he gave a particularly candid response.

He did not say or mean it unkindly, but he did pinpoint the moment he ditched his tennis-playing partner.

‘I think what happened has been for the better in terms of my golf,’ he revealed.

‘I’ve put a bit more time into it and it has refocused me. I mean, what else do I have to do now?

'I go to the golf course, I go to the gym and it’s just my life at the minute.

'I worked pretty hard before but the past couple of months I’ve really just buried myself in my game. It obviously works pretty well, so I am going to keep doing it.’

McIlroy will hope his good form continues as he looks to secure a third win on the trot - and at the halfway stage he is in a strong position to continue his post-break up brillinance at the USPGA Championships.
