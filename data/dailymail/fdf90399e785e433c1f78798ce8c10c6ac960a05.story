Two young brothers have died after falling through thin ice on a pond on their adopted parents' rural Idaho farm.

T.J. Frey, 11, and his nine-year-old brother Nate had been playing behind their family's house in Prescott, southwest Iowa on Saturday afternoon but failed to return home.

Family members launched a search and discovered the boys' belongings near to a hole in the ice around 20 yards from shore. Their parents, Tom and Leisa Frey, immediately alerted authorities.

Emergency crews, including a helicopter and dive team, arrived on the scene within minutes.

Creston Fire Department officials wearing ice suits entered the pond and found one of the boys right away, around one foot under water near to the hole, the Des Moines Register reported.

They found the other body about 20 minutes later.

Both of the boys were taken to hospital by helicopter, but they were pronounced dead.

Authorities said they do not know what the boys - who were described as inseparable - were doing on the ice, but suspect they were simply playing.

Heartbreaking scene: The large pond can be seen just south of the Frey's home in Prescott, Iowa

'It was a beautiful day,' Corning Fire Chief and Adams County Emergency Management Director Donnie Willett said. 'They were out exploring.'

Their parents have four of their own children and adopted a baby boy several years ago, friends told KCCI. They later adopted the baby's two brother - T.J. and Nate - to keep them together.

'It was a loving and supportive family,' John Walsh, the principal at St. Malachy School in Creston, where the boys were students. 'They had a good home. Lots of love.'

Walsh added that the boys, who were always together, were good students. T.J. played the trumpet, Nate played the saxophone and their teachers said they were both good readers.

Inseparable: Nate, left, and T.J. were best friends and went everywhere together, their teachers said

Loved: The two boys, pictured center, were adopted by the Freys (pictured left and right, back row) several years ago. The couple already had four children and adopted the boys and their baby brother

Grief counselors were at the school on Monday to speak with the boys' classmates.

On Saturday temperatures reached 46 degrees, which was unusually warm, the Register reported.

Iowa Department of Natural Resources officials added that ice is inherently unsafe.

'We never say thereâ€™s such a thing as safe ice, because ice thickness varies on bodies of water,' DNR spokesman Mick Klemesrud said. 'Never trust ice.'

The boys will be remembered at a funeral service on Saturday at Holy Spirit Catholic Church in Creston.
