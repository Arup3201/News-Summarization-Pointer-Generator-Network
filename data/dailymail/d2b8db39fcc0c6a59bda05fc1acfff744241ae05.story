A 911 dispatcher broke the rules to talk a toddler's grandmother through how to give the youngster CPR - and ultimately save his life.

Seventeen-month-old Aidan Walker had been feeling unwell when he went down for a nap in Galax, Virginia in December as his grandmother, Cheri Grable, watched him.

Suddenly the boy suffered a seizure and stopped breathing. His mother, Melissa Grable, immediately called 911 and desperately begged for help.

'Oh my God, my baby, my baby!' she can be heard saying on the 911 call, first shared by WSLS. 'He's not breathing! Oh my God, oh my God!'

Rule breaker: Dispatcher Tim Webb decided to give Aidan's grandmother instructions even though the police department does not have emergency medical dispatch certification

The dispatcher at the Galax Police Department, Tim Webb, can be heard patiently trying to calm the women down as he confirms the boy's age, whether he had been eating  and if they knew CPR.

'No! No! What do we do?' Cheri Grable can be heard asking.

Webb had a choice: even though he knows CPR, the police department does not have emergency medical dispatch certification, so he is not allowed to give out CPR instructions over the phone.

'Without some sort of life-saving measures, the child would expire,' Webb told WSLS. 'I wasn't gonna let that happen, even if it meant being reprimanded.' 

He said his chief, Rick Clark, was also in the room during the call and heard the situation. As soon as they locked eyes, Webb said he knew that Clark supported him taking action.

So he got to work. 

Relief: His grandmother Cheri Grable, left, and mother Melissa Grable, right, were able to get him breathing

Fighter: Aidan is now well again - and his family said that they will be life-long friends with Webb

'I'm not gonna let you lose him,' he said on the call. 'Put him on your kitchen table ok?'

He told them to use two fingers to make sure the boy's head was tilted back slightly. 

'All right, barely pinch his nose off and put your mouth over top of his mouth, and I need you to blow in it just a second and see ok?' Webb instructed.

The women then report that the boy's chest is moving again and that the color is returning to his face. Webb instructs them to turn him on his side in case the boy vomits. 

'It was the scariest day of my life,' Aidan's Mother Melissa Grable said. 'All I could do was say a prayer, over and over and over, "please God don't take my son from me".'

The family has since visited the police department to meet Webb in person and thank him - and said they will be returning throughout the years as Aiden grows. 

'You're a lifelong friend,' Melissa told him.
