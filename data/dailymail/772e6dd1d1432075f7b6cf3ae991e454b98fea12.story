Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond's chosen question for the referendum on independence has been rejected by the Electoral Commission for being worded to encourage people to vote Yes

The elections watchdog today threw out an attempt by Alex Salmond to skew the question in the Scottish independence referendum to coax people into voting Yes.

The Scottish Government wanted to ask voters: 'Do you agree that Scotland should be an independent country? Yes/No.'

But the independent Electoral Commission has demanded 'more neutral wording' and insisted voters have a clearer idea about what severing ties with the rest of the UK will mean for Scotland.

It also recommended the main Yes and No campaigns be allowed to spend up to £1.5million each in the run up to the big vote.

The rejection of Mr Salmond's question comes after a poll showed support his dream of going it alone is now at its lowest level since the Scottish Parliament was created in 1999.

Just 23 per cent of people want Scotland to leave the UK, the annual Scottish Social Attitudes survey for 2012 revealed.

It
showed a dramatic drop from 2011 when 32 per cent supported 
independence. Almost 60 per cent of those surveyed now say they are 
‘quite’ or ‘very’ worried about independence, up from 46 per cent in 
2011.

Mr Salmond has secured a deal with David Cameron to stage a referendum on independence in autumn 2014.

Plain language experts were consulted about Mr Salmond's proposed question, and in surveys it was repeatedly found to be designed to encourage people to back independence

In focus groups voters said Mr Salmond's wording 'implies that Scotland being independent is a "good thing" because voters are being invited to agree with this view' and suggested independence was 'inevitable' and voters were being asked to 'rubber-stamp' it.

Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon used Twitter to announce the Scottish government would accept the recommendations

The Scottish government wanted to ask: 

'Do you agree that Scotland should be an independent country? Yes/No.'

But the Electoral Commission said it was a leading question and proposed:

'Should Scotland be an independent country? Yes/No.'

The recommendation has been accepted.

One person said: 'You’re free to say no, but it goes against the grain with that word[agree], you don’t feel comfortable putting no.'

The Commission has now drawn up an alternative: 'Should Scotland be an independent country? Yes/No.'

Deputy first minister Nicola Sturgeon wrote on Twitter this morning: 'I can confirm that the Scottish Government will accept all of the Electoral Commission's #indyref recommendations.'

John McCormick, Electoral Commissioner 
for Scotland said: 'Voters are entitled to a referendum which produces a
result they can have confidence in.

'We have rigorously tested the proposed 
question, speaking to a wide range of people across Scotland.

Any 
referendum question must be, and be seen to be, neutral. People told us 
that they felt the words "Do you agree" could lead voters towards voting Yes.'

Mr Salmond last year struck a deal with David Cameron to hold a referendum on independence in autumn 2014

Research by the watchdog also found that voters want factual information ahead of the referendum.

'Although we would not expect the terms of independence to be agreed before the vote, clarity about how the terms of independence will be decided would help voters understand how the competing claims made by campaigners before the referendum will be resolve,' the Commission added.

The UK and Scottish governments should agree a 'joint position' on how independence would be negotiated before the referendum.

Mr McCormick added: 'People had a clear understanding that ‘independent country’ meant being separate from the UK.

'But they did want factual information in advance about what will happen after the referendum. We’re asking the UK and Scottish Government to provide that clarity and we’ll then make sure it gets to voters as part of our public awareness campaign.'

Better off in: The Scottish Social Attitudes survey revealed only 23 per cent of people want Scotland to be independent, the lowest level since the Scottish Parliament was established in 1999

The Commission also set out details of how much the two sides should spend in the run up to the referendum.

The two lead campaigns fighting funds would be capped at £1.5million each.

Among parties in the Scottish Parliament, the pro-independence Scottish National Party would be allowed £1.34million, while opponents would be capped at £84,000 for Scottish Labour, £396,000 for Scottish Conservatives and £201,000 for Scottish Lib Dems and £150,000. The Green Party could spend £150,000.
