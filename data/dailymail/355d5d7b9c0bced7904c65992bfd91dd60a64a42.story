Can you tell the difference between a fake $50 note and a real one? It seems most people have trouble spotting the difference. 

The Commander of the NSW Police Force’s Fraud and Cybercrime Squad has urged the community to be on the lookout for counterfeit banknotes, with double the amount of fake notes being reported from July to August.

Detective Superintendent Arthur Katsogiannis says fakes have been circulating in numerous locations throughout NSW in recent weeks.

The Commander of the NSW  Fraud and Cybercrime Squad has urged the community to be on the lookout for counterfeit banknotes, after an increase in the number of counterfeit notes reported to police during August. The fake notes have been circulating in numerous locations throughout NSW in recent weeks

Two counterfeit $100 notes (top) seized by police are held next to a genuine note (bottom). The counterfeit notes appear very similar to the actual notes but are slightly darker and the clear window is stuck on. 

'Since the beginning of August, we have seen an increase in the number of counterfeit banknotes being reported to police,' he said.

'During July, we received 41 reports concerning counterfeit banknotes. The number of reports for August was 81.'

Police have seen a number of different counterfeit notes throughout the last month. 

'While the notes we’ve seized have been from a range of denominations, the vast majority are fifty and one hundred dollar notes,' said Detective Superintendent Katsogiannis.

'Some of the counterfeit notes we’ve seized have been printed on paper, and some on plastic. All genuine banknotes are printed on a special form of plastic.'

For those who think they might be victim to receiving a counterfeit banknote, police say there are some key features which can tell them apart from the real notes. 

'With respect to the counterfeit notes printed on paper, they tear quite easily. Obviously, real notes do not tear.' he said.

Two counterfeit $100 notes seized by police in Sydney. Police say counterfeit notes printed on paper tear quite easily while real ones do not. Plastic counterfeit notes usually feel slightly thicker and have poorer clarity

Plastic counterfeit money usually feels slightly thicker than the real thing and the clarity of the images is not as sharp as a real note. 

Police are appealing to consumers as well as business owners to keep an eye out for fake notes, being sure to check all security features are there. 

'If you find a banknote that you are concerned about, please let us know,' said the detective.

Anyone with information about counterfeit banknotes is urged to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or go to the Crime Stoppers online reporting page. 

*Handle the suspect banknote as little as possible and store it in an envelope.

*Note any relevant information, such as how it came into your possession.

*Report the matter immediately to State or Federal police.

*You are well within your rights to refuse to accept a banknote if you have concerns about it.

*Under no circumstances should you take actions that may jeopardise your safety or that of others.
