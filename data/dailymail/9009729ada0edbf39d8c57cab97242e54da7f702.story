Dereck Chisora has been fined for jumping a red light and fleeing from police.

The European heavyweight champion was ordered to pull over by an officer in Finchley, north London last April but failed to comply.

Chisora was also driving his 5.5 litre Mercedes SUV without insurance.

The boxer did not have insurance when he was ordered to pull over in Finchley, north London, last April

He was fined £665 plus costs at Willesden Magistrates' Court on Monday but was not present for the hearing.

Chisora's lawyer Barry Warburton told the court: 'The police officer's attention was drawn because they were sitting in a traffic queue and he wound his window down and asked: "Do you have a driving licence?"

'My client said it was an international drivers' licence and the officer said there was no such thing.'

He also did not have a British driving licence but his lawyer said: 'It was in fact a full Zimbabwean driving licence and all he has to do is send it to DVLA and they will send back a full UK driving licence.'

When asked how long his client had been living in the country the lawyer replied: 'I have no idea and it doesn't matter anyway. He's not doing anything unlawful driving on a Zimbabwean licence.

'He's pleaded guilty to the red traffic light, he says it was marginal, but accepts he should have stopped.

'The vehicle was fully insured for named drivers over thirty years-old.'

Chisora was not a named driver on the policy.

The former British champion is currently training for his clash with Tyson Fury at the ExCeL Centre in London on November 29.
