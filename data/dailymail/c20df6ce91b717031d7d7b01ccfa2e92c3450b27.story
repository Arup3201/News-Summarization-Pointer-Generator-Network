Players and staff at a Premier League football club have lost £30,000 to fraudsters in a scam, it was claimed today.

Footballer Andy Carroll and manager Sam Allardyce were among West Ham United FC employees who allegedly fell prey to the scam  at the club's training ground in Chadwell Heath, Essex.

The con artist was offering cut-price Fortnum & Mason hampers and Harrods champagne last month - and the pair paid £11,000 but never saw the goods delivered, according to reports.

The fraudster took £30,000 in total from players and staff and also targeted Championship team Norwich City, where he conned players out of £5,000, reported The Sun journalist Mike Sullivan.

A source told the newspaper: ‘He was offering top quality champagnes and hampers from Harrods and Fortnum & Mason at ridiculously cheap prices.

‘The conman told them he had some good contacts in these firms and assured them it was all legal and above board. They were told stuff would be delivered in a short while.’

Metropolitan Police officers were informed on Christmas Eve and have now begun an investigation.

A spokesman for the London force told MailOnline today: ‘Officers from Newham are investigating an allegation of fraud which occurred on Friday, December 12.'

She added: ‘It was reported to police on December 24 and inquiries are continuing. There have been no arrests.’

Nobody at Norwich City was available for comment today, while a Norfolk Constabulary employee said the force could not comment. A West Ham spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment this morning.

But today, Carroll took to Twitter just after midday to tell his 280,000 followers: 'My money is safe'.

England international Carroll, who earns in the region of £85,000 a week at West Ham, announced on Christmas Day that his fiancée Billi Mucklow was pregnant with their first child. 

Allardyce, 60, took over West Ham in June 2011 - while the club paid £17million for Carroll, 25, from Liverpool in June 2013, following a loan spell. The striker has scored 12 goals in 48 games.
