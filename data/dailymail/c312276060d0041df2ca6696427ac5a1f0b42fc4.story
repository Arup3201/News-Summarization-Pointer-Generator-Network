A pregnant woman sticking up for two others mothers on a Brisbane bus has been the victim of an appalling verbal attack herself from another passenger. 

Nine News reported it all started on a bus in the Caboolture area, north of Brisbane, when one woman wasn't very happy after she had to change seats for two mothers with prams.

It's believed she then started to begin complaining, saying, 'I don't hate adults, I hate kids.'

Passengers were then shocked at what happened next when a pregnant lady turned around to stick up for her fellow mothers, who then became the victim herself of a disturbing display of verbal abuse.

'If you don't shut the f**k up, someone on this bus is guna punch you in the face,' said the pregnant lady (pictured) to the woman who started complaining about changing seats for two mothers with prams on a Brisbane bus

The footage, which was taken by another passenger, shows the pregnant woman turn around in her seat and start to yell at the lady in the brown shirt.

'If you don't shut the f**k up, someone on this bus is guna punch you in the face,' said the pregnant lady.

'And it's probably guna be me.'

Clearly unimpressed with what she had to say, the woman in the brown shirt then says, 'you know what'll happen?'

'What' replied the pregnant lady.

'You'll probably lose the baby.'

'Are you threatening me,' she replied.

Nine News says that other passengers on the bus also got involved in the argument, in defence of the pregnant woman.

And the arguments continued on from there, it's believed the war of words between passengers dragged on for about 20 minutes. 

It comes just a month after another shocking incident on Queensland transport when a train guard was racially abused by a passenger.

Last month, a teenager on a Brisbane train, launched a scathing verbal attack on a train security guard of African decent which was all filmed by his friend and posted to social media.

The argument on a Brisbane bus, which saw a number of other passengers interject apparently continued on for about 20 minutes
