Maybe Louis van Gaal is the genius he often purports himself to be after all.

Here at a rapturous Arena Fonte Nova, Van Gaal made one of the biggest calls of this World Cup and saw it take his team in to a semi-final with Argentina on Wednesday.

Having seen his team pour all over Costa Rica for 120 minutes but fail to score, Van Gaal sent on Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul to face the penalties.

Krul had barely had time warm up and the man he replaced,  Jasper Cillessen, had made a save in the 118th minute to keep his country in the competition.

But Van Gaal is a coach who always seems to know what he is doing and Krul saved the second Costa Rica penalty from Fulham’s Bryan Ruiz, and then the fourth from Michael Umana, to take  Holland through.

It was all
 that the Dutch deserved, too. Not only did they produce a nerveless 
shootout performance to score through Robin van Persie, Wesley Sneijder,
 Arjen Robben and Dirk Kuyt, they were relentless all night in the face 
of some remarkable  misfortune.

Robben was the star of the 120 minutes. Four of the Costa Rica back five were booked for fouling him. Not once did he dive.

Sneijder,
 meanwhile, hit the frame of the goal twice - once in the 119th minute -
 while Costa Rica goalkeeper Keylor Navas made a string of great saves.

This
 World Cup has another great story to add to the list and another great 
game. This one had the right ending, though. This tournament has a 
semi-final to savour.

Van
 Gaal’s team were superior in the first half, too. They dominated 
possession and, with Sneijder perhaps playing his best football of the 
World Cup to date, they created enough promising positions to have taken
 a firm grip on the game.

What
 was missing was good decision-making and timing. All too often the 
Dutch managed to break on the Costa Rica backline only to let themselves
 down when it mattered.

It was unlike them as, on the whole, they have shown a clinical edge in front of goal.

Van
 Persie was guilty early on. Having started the tournament so brightly 
with his explosive  performance against Spain, the Manchester United 
striker looked frustrated after failing to take an opportunity fashioned
 beautifully by the industry of Dirk Kuyt and the vision of Memphis 
Depay.

Depay’s
 pass found Van Persie with only the keeper to beat but he could not 
manage it. The impressive Navas blocked to keep Costa Rica level.

Navas also saved Sneijder’s follow up from the edge of the area and, later, was equal to a free-kick from the same player.

That apart, Navas did not have to excel but Holland really should have worked him more.

An early run by Robben looked dangerous but was ended by a tackle from Giancarlo Gonzalez. Robben did not go to ground.

The Bayern Munich player remained dangerous and whenever Holland advanced it was Robben who was at the heart of things.

More than once he seemed about to make a decisive intervention only for things to break down or an offside flag to go up.

Navas did make one more save of note in the first half, blocking from Depay.

Costa
 Rica seemed happy to wait for chances. They looked dangerous at 
set-pieces and came close after the half-hour when Celso Borges headed 
down a free-kick and an overhead kick from Johnny Acosta forced Van 
Persie to hack clear.

Costa Rican confidence was growing and who could blame them? Since the interval, Holland had threatened only sporadically.

Van
 Persie and Robben combined midway through the half but the 
centre-forward’s return into Robben’s path was underhit and Costa Rica 
cleared.

Van
 Persie was having a poor night. Van Gaal then brought on Jeremain Lens.
 He was offside when bringing a save from Navas before Sneijder smacked a
 post with a free-kick.

Van Persie then brought a low save from Navas. On both occasions, Costa Rica were fortunate to see the ball rebound to safety.

Even
 Van Persie could not be blamed deep in added time, when his far-post 
shot from a Daley Blind cross rolled up Yeltsin Tejeda’s shin and on to 
the bar. 

It
 was an astonishing end to a 90-minute period that belonged to the 
Dutch. Into extra time and Ron Vlaar saw a header saved then Acosta had 
to hack clear from his own line.

Nothing
 they could do, it seemed, could save them from the ordeal of a penalty 
shootout. And even then Costa Rica almost won it at the death, Marcos 
Urena weaving through to shoot against Cillessen, before Sneijder struck
 the bar with two minutes left.
