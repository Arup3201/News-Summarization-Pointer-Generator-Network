A former AFL player has been granted bail after being charged over an elaborate kidnapping plot which allegedly also involved a media adviser to Clive Palmer and a former detective.

Former Sydney Swans player Tony Smith was granted bail in Brisbane Magistrates Court on Tuesday after pledging a $250,000 surety. 

Under bail conditions Smith, who lives in Bali, is allowed to return to Indonesia but must advise the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions of all overseas travel.

Smith, along with media adviser Andrew Crook and former detective Mick Featherstone, is accused of trying to persuade a National Australia Bank executive to admit to committing perjury during a Supreme Court civil lawsuit.

Smith tried to sue NAB over $68 million he lost in a building project and shares in failed mortgage broker MFS, but the case was dismissed in 2012.

The bank employee was allegedly lured to an Indonesian island with the false promise of a job interview, supposedly for a high-paid global finance officer position with Clive Palmer.

Police allege when the NAB worker refused to say during the interview he had lied to the court, he was 'detained' by two Indonesian nationals dressed in security uniforms and further threatened.

Smith, 48, has been charged with one count each of retaliation of a witness, attempting to pervert the course of justice and attempted fraud. 

Crook, 48, and Featherstone, 51, were arrested and granted bail last month with conditions including they surrender their passports and not go within 100 metres of the NAB branches at Southport on the Gold Coast.

The former footballer played for the Swans from 1986 to 1988, chalking up a total of 17 games. 

It comes after it was revealed on Monday the alleged plot had been reported to police two years earlier but nobody followed it up, the ABC reported.

The Crime and Corruption Commission is now investigating the matter after police sources told the national broadcaster a 109-page statement had been prepared for the police by NAB on behalf of an employee.

It was handed over to police on January 30, 2013.

A bank spokesman confirmed a 'full briefing' had been given to police in relation to the matter.

The alleged kidnapping plot only came to light after Queensland Police Service's Taskforce Maxima - one aimed at stopping bikie-related incidents - found emails and other documents pointing to the incident.

The taskforce was looking into Featherstone at the time, including his association with bikies as well as former and current police officers, and accusations of money laundering.
