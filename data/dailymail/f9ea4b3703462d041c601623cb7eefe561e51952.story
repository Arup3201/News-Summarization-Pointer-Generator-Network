Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams is facing calls to apologise to the family of a man who was shot three times in an IRA punishment attack

Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams is facing calls to apologise to the family of a man who bled to death after being shot three times in an IRA punishment attack.

Andrew Kearney, 33, was abducted from his West Belfast flat and shot by masked raiders in July 1998 weeks after allegedly punching a senior IRA member during a bar brawl.

His sister Eleanor King said Mr Adams privately apologised for the killing of the father-of-one but has refused to do so publicly.

Speaking as part of an RTÉ documentary about paramilitary 'punishment attacks', she said: 'He should have come forward and told the IRA what to do. 

'As in to come forward and admit it publicly. And, yes, give a public apology.

'And in my opinion, if he had done that, even if he didn't call for anybody to be arrested or anything, but just even the public apology and the public acceptance, it would have caused the family a lot less heartache over the years.'

King said her family had been republicans their whole lives and that her mother Maureen welcomed Gerry Adams 'with open arms' after her son had been killed. 

'The first thing he told us was that he was extending an apology from the top of the republican movement,' she said.

Sinn Féin MLA Alex Maskey told the programme that Adams acknowledges meeting the family but is unaware of what was said.

The documentary also features Thomas Marley, whose son Gerard took his own life in 1997 after he was the victim of two punishment attacks.

Mr Marley said: '(The IRA) kept on doing it, killing people with their shotguns blowing legs off, using bars. They thought it was fun, it was the right thing. But it wasn't.'

Punishment attacks by paramilitaries were common during The Troubles and were often supported by local communities. They increased after the 1994 ceasefires.

They began in majority republican communities but loyalist paramilitaries soon began carrying out their own punishment attacks. 

In 1998, Andrew Peden was packing up his car for a trip to the seaside with his young family when he was abducted by the Ulster Volunteer Force.

They beat him for 12 hours before shooting him in both legs with a shotgun. He spent several months in hospital. Both of his legs were amputated above the knee.

The attack happened just three weeks after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and its promise of a bright future for the people of Northern Ireland. 

During the Troubles, most of the attacks took place in North and West Belfast. 

What began in republican areas was copied by loyalists who went on to carry out more punishment beatings and shootings than republicans.

Former UVF prisoner Tom Winstone, director of a restorative justice programme on Belfast's Shankill Road, told the documentary: 'It might just surprise you how much mistrust there was in loyalist communities towards the police.

'When you are talking about punishment violence, I think everyone understands and knows that it's wrong but unfortunately a lot of people didn't bat an eyelid about that.'

Above The Law, a Below The Radar TV production in association with the RTE Investigation Unit, will be broadcast tomorrow on RTE ONE at 9.35pm.
