HMRC chief executive Lin Homer refused to rule out using controversial snooping powers against future whistleblowers

Britain's tax boss last night refused to rule out using anti-terrorist powers again to target whistleblowers.

Three years ago, HM Revenue & Customs sparked fury by invoking the controversial Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) against an employee who revealed its sweetheart deal with Goldman Sachs.

Internal investigators snooped on his emails, internet records and phone calls to find out whether he had leaked the story to a newspaper.

Margaret Hodge, chairman of the powerful Commons public accounts committee, said the actions had shocked her ‘to the bone’ and had left the whistleblower a ‘broken man’.

But when questioned by MPs yesterday, HMRC chief executive Lin Homer refused to rule out using Ripa against future whistleblowers.

The MPs also heard from one NHS whistleblower whose mental health problems were used against her when she tried to expose a cover-up at the Care Quality Commission watchdog.

Committee member Richard Bacon said: ‘This is the sort of thing that used to happen in the Soviet Union’.

Mrs Hodge said there was a ‘culture of fear’ across the public sector that stopped workers speaking out to report abuses. A Department of Health official admitted that a survey had found barely half of NHS staff said they would feel confident doing so.

MPs grilled Mrs Homer about the case of Osita Mba, an HMRC employee who exposed the deal which allowed Goldman Sachs to escape paying £10million in interest on unpaid tax.

The story appeared in The Guardian and it emerged soon after that HMRC had used Ripa powers to snoop on Mr Mba’s emails and phone to try to prove he had leaked the story.

The powers are supposed to be used to combat terrorism and large-scale criminal tax frauds.

Mr Mba, who worked in the personal tax litigation team, was suspended by HMRC. He was also due to appear in front of the committee, but pulled out.

Mrs Hodge told Mrs Homer: ‘The thing which shocked me most was that you made a request under Ripa, which in effect is there to deal with terrorism.

What I want to hear from you is that you’ll never do that again when you’ve got a whistleblower.

‘It shocked me to my bone that these very very, very extreme powers were being used and that he was hounded to the extent that you’ve broken him. The department has broken him and it’s awful.’

Mrs Homer refused to say it would never happen again, because HMRC had a duty of care to both its staff and taxpayers’ expectation that their affairs would be confidential.

Although the committee invited whistleblowers from the worlds of health, education, police, local government and HMRC, only one – from health – felt brave enough to appear.

Kay Sheldon worked at the CQC but was denigrated and told she had a mental health problem when she tried to expose a cover-up.
