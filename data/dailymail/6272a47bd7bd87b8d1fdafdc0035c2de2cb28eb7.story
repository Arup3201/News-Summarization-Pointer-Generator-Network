Arsenal might not always bring happiness to their supporters but the players did their best to spread Christmas cheer to children in local London hospitals.

The Gunners headed  to two different hospitals with sacks full of presents for the patients to brighten the young fans' moods.

Aaron Ramsey, Mesut Ozil, Mathieu Debuchy, Laurent Koscielny, Kieran Gibbs, Mathieu Flamini and Per Mertesacker visited the Children's Ward at the Whittington Hospital in Archway.

The club, through the Arsenal Foundation, are involved in numerous charitable activities around the community throughout the year

Meanwhile, Wojciech Szczesny, Mikel Arteta, Calum Chambers, Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain visited The Royal Free Hospital to meet young patients and give out presents on behalf of the club.

The club pride themselves on trying to make a difference in their community through their charitable arm, the Arsenal Foundation.

Olivier Giroud and David Ospina visited a local school earlier in the month while the squad also donated a day's wages to the foundation when they beat Newcastle 4-1 in their last Premier League match.
