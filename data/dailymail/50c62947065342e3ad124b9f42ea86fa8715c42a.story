A former chocolate addict has lost more than nine stone in weight after she took up martial arts and kicked excess sugar out of her diet.

At her heaviest mother-of-one Kirsty Lynch, 41, weighed 21st 9lb and had to wear size 24 clothes after years of overeating.

With her confidence at rock bottom in 2011, Ms Lynch, who is mother to 17-year-old Aaron, joined a kickboxing class in 2011, and soon saw the weight fall away.

Kirsty admits that when she first began kickboxing she struggled with the physical demands - sometimes ending classes being sick

After two 
months of training she had lost more than a stone and a half. As the months wore on,
 she began training more and her efforts were rewarded recently when she checked the scales to see that she weighed 12st 8lb - a total weight loss of 9st 1lb.

As
 her confidence increased Kirsty also began taking part in competitions. In 
December 2012 she became the English ladies champion in the 60kg-plus 
novice category, an achievement she topped with victory in the Lordswood
 tri-series competition in the same category in October 2013.

Today she is a two-time champion kickboxer and hopes to soon qualify as an instructor.

She said: 'I spent most of the first session gasping for breath or outside being sick. I was in such poor physical condition that it was a complete shock to the system.

'When I woke the next day, I could feel pain in muscles I never knew I had. But somewhere along the way, I had been completely hooked. I knew I would go back.'

Kirsty gained weight while pregnant due to her cravings for chocolate and junk food, and then found herself in an unhappy cycle of dieting and comforting eating

Ms Lynch saw her weight creep up after giving birth to Aaron, her only child, seventeen years ago.

She said: 'I’d been quite sporty at school and had really enjoyed playing hockey. Before falling pregnant I’d worn size 12 clothing.

'I got some very strong cravings. I couldn’t stop eating Cadbury or Galaxy chocolate, along with every type of biscuit imaginable, and helpings of strawberries and cream. I reasoned I was eating for two so I paid it no mind.

Kirsty said: 'I used to live as if I was in Groundhog Day - every single day was the same, and I had nothing to look forward to. Now, my days are so exciting. I feel as if I’ve been given a new life.'

'I put on an awful lot of weight above what I was expecting with the pregnancy.'

Following the birth, the cravings did not subside.

She said: 'On the outside, I was a happy, cheerful person. But inside I was miserable. The more miserable I felt, the more I found comfort in food.

'I made a deadly mistake that food was my friend, rather than recognising it as the fuel for my unhappiness.

To date Kirsty has lost over nine stone through her martial arts training and making changes to her diet

'I tried every fad diet under the sun - the cabbage diet, Weight Watchers, Atkins - but chocolate remained my downfall.'

In late 2009, Ms Lynch was left in agony when she tore her ligaments in both knees while jogging with friends.

Finally, in May 2011 a friend suggested she join her at a kickboxing class running near her home in Stone, Staffordshire.

She said: 'I was nervous at first, but I loved the way everyone was so friendly in the class. It was not like the gym, where people often keep themselves to themselves.

Breakfast: Bowl of Coco Pops and toast

Lunch: Chicken tikka sandwich

Dinner: Steak and Ale pie and chips

Snacks: Several chunky chocolate bars

Breakfast: Porridge and fruit

Lunch: Wholemeal pasta and tomato sauce

Dinner: Grilled chicken and vegetables

Snacks: Granola bars or fruit 

'Instead, there was a sense that everyone was in it together. It was a very eclectic bunch, motivated by a desire to ‘go hard or go home’. It was much more my kind of thing.'

She also radically changed her diet as the physical exercise put her more in tune with her body’s nutritional requirements.

While she was overweight, she typically ate a bowl of Coco Pops with toast for breakfast, followed by a chicken tikka sandwich for lunch and steak and ale pie with chips for dinner. She would snack on chunky chocolate bars throughout the day.

Kristy, who now trains three times a week, has won numerous trophies and said martial arts has changed her life

Today, she typically eats porridge with fruit for breakfast, followed by wholemeal pasta with tomato and basil sauce for lunch, followed by chargrilled chicken with fresh vegetables for evening meal.

She snacks at set intervals during the day, usually on granola bars or pieces of fruit.

Kirsty has also encouraged her son to start kickboxing, is at purple belt level and is working towards her black belt, which will entitle her to become an instructor.

She said: 'I used to live as if I was in Groundhog Day - every single day was the same, and I had nothing to look forward to. Now, my days are so exciting. I feel as if I’ve been given a new life.

'I have martial arts, and the people who helped me to discover it, to thank for that.'
