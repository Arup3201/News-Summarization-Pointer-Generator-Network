Samsung and David Ortiz appear to have duped President Obama into participating in their latest questionable promotional stunt.

The supposedly spontaneous selfie the Red Sox hitter snapped with a smiling Obama on the White House lawn on Tuesday was in fact sponsored by the South Korean tech-giant as part of a new commercial relationship between the two.

What had initially seemed a genuine part of the 2013 World Series winner's celebrations was confirmed to be an advertising campaign that brought a curt response from Jay Carney, the White House spokesman and himself a diehard Red Sox fan.

Selfie and self-promotion: The photograph that David Ortiz took with President Obama on Tuesday was quickly seized upon by Samsung after it was announced that they and Ortiz had signed up to a commercial deal together

'POTUS did not know,' said Carney in an email sent to Bloomberg, confirming that Obama had essentially been tricked into an attempt to boost the social media profile of Samsung and their cellphones.

Proving as gleefully off-the-cuff as Ellen DeGeneres' 'Best Selfie Ever' at the Oscars, Samsung confirmed to ABCNews.com that they and the Red Sox player had conspired to snap the photo which was re-tweeted almost 40,000 times through Ortiz's Twitter account.

Claiming they were 'thrilled to see the special historic moment David Ortiz captured with his Galaxy Note3', Samsung said that 'Similar to the selfie Ellen was able to capture during the Oscars, this was an opportunity for David to share the incredible moment.'

However, Samsung said that a selfie with Obama was not specifically planned, although it would have obviously been top of the list of a White House visit.

'We didnâ€™t know if or what he would be able to capture using his Note 3 device,' the company said Tuesday in a statement, the Boston Globe reported Wednesday.

Samsung did admit that prior to the Red Sox anticipated visit to the White House where they presented the president with his own '44' jersey, they 'worked with David and the team on how to share images with fans.'

Ortiz grabbed the opportunity for his presidential selfie during the middle of the ceremony photo-op on Tuesday, asking Obama, 'Actually, would you mind if I take my own?'

Tellingly, one of his teammates yelled 
out, 'cha-ching' - possibly indicating he knew of the deal Ortiz had 
signed with Samsung, which was announced on Monday.

He quickly posted the picture, writing, 'What an honor! Thanks for the #selfie, @BarackObama.'

While the picture didn't come close to Ellen's record of 3.4 million retweets, Samsung US immediately retweeted the picture to its 5 million followers, writing: 'Big Papi, Big Selfie.'

Samsung US were quick to tell its followers that the phone the shot was taken with.

It retails for up to $700 on Amazon, dependent on the contract.

As Twitter users quickly wised up to what was going on, they asked Samsung US's account what had happened.

'This photo was taken with a #GalaxyNote3,' Samsung immediately tweeted.

The White House assiduously guards the presidents image and as Jay Carney commented, had no idea about the selfie.

However, while David Ortiz may now be tied into a commercial partnership with Samsung - as little as one month ago he was uploading pictures to Twitter using an iPhone.

This is similar to the situation Samasung faced with DeGeneres taking pictures during the televised Oscar's with a Samsung and then tweeting backstage pictures with her iPhone.

On an appearance on Ellen in March, President Obama joked that her famous A-list selfie was a 'pretty cheap stunt'.
