A cross-eyed cat who loves Christmas has been given his very own festive makeover.

Spangles not only has a very distinctive stare, but just loves donning cute outfits like these new Christmas costumes.

Proud owner Mary Buchanan, 27, a college student from Spartanburg, South Carolina, adopted him from a neighbour when he was five months old.

She said: 'Spangles loves his costumes. Christmas is his favourite time of year because he gets to wear so many cute costumes.

'If he doesn't want to pose he will just walk off.'

Spangles, a five-year-old tabby, was only too happy to pose for this adorable selection, in which he sports a selection of festive hats, a brightly coloured Christmas jumper, an elf outfit and some reindeer headgear.

He was born with one cross eye, but has never had problems walking.

Mary said: 'He's never run into things, or wobbled.

'He can see perfectly fine. He has been checked out by a vet, and no surgery is needed to correct his sight.

The puss has become an internet sensation after his owner made him a Facebook page, which now has more than 57,500 likes.

Spangles was born on July 4, hence his name.

When he's not donning Christmas gear he doesn't mind being seen dressed as a frog, a unicorn and a pirate.

He may be cross-eyed, but Spangles has no trouble walking straight, says his owner.

Don't cross this cute pirate or you'll be made to walk the plank
