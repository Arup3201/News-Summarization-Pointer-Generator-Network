Former U.S. senator Scott Brown is now gearing up for both of his daughters' weddings after his eldest said 'yes' on New Year's Eve.

Ayla Brown, 25, a former basketball star-turned-country music singer, was performing onstage at the Tuckerman Theatre in Massachusetts when her boyfriend Keith Weiser popped the big question.

She excitedly took to social media to share the big news and posted photographs of her alongside her future husband wearing her new diamond engagement band.

The look of love: A thrilled Ayla posted on her Facebook page after the proposal: 'Thank you to Keith Weiser for making my dreams come true'

'Thank you to Keith Weiser for making my dreams come true,' Ayla, a former American Idol contestant, wrote on her Facebook page yesterday.

'I didn’t think 2013 could be any better until this happened at my show last night. I love you Keith and I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you!'

Her proud father - who infamously described his daughters as 'available' during his 2010 acceptance speech - told the Inside Track that 28-year-old Keith had been planning his surprise for some time.

'He’s
 had the ring for a while, he had it specially made for her,' he said.

'He flew up here under the guise of spending New Year’s with us and 
during her second set, the encore, he asked her onstage in front of a 
few thousand people. We’re very happy.'

Ayla
 and Keith, 28, have been dating for more than a year after meeting on a night out in Nashville.

The two recently bought a house together in the city,
 where Ayla is currently pursuing her singing career.

Keith, from Hamilton, Ohio, is a former minor league baseball 
player who retired from the sport after eight years last June.

He is now focused on teaching and runs training camps in the area where he grew up.

His Facebook profile picture shows him smiling with Ayla, his 6ft 3in stature just topping her 6ft frame.

Theirs is the second engagement in the Brown household in 
less than a year.

Ayla's younger sister, Arianna, got engaged in mid-August 2013 to one of their father's ex-staffers, Jim Hendry.

The couple, both 23,,are set to tie the knot at the Flaghill Winery in Lee, New Hampshire this July.

Jim currently works at the Department of Justice while Arianna, a former teen model, is training to become a vet.

A family friend commented on Facebook at the news of Ayla's engagement: 'Both daughters getting married at the same time. Scott and Gail [his wife of 26 years] are going to be very busy.'
