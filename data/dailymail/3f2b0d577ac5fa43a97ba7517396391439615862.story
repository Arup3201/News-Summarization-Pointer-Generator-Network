A ‘bankrupt’ tycoon at the centre of the country’s most acrimonious divorce case made his wife a £300 million 'flippant' settlement offer four years ago, a court has heard.

Scot Young, 51, promised his wife Michelle, 49, the amount, which she is now seeking in the High Court, if 'Ronald Reagan was the next President and Jeremy Beadle walked through the door.'

Property developer Young, who is representing himself, said he had been drinking heavily before he  wrote an opening note which admitted the 2009 offer.

He is accused of ‘manipulating his financial affairs so as to 'do down' his estranged wife, who claims that he is worth 'a few billion at least'.

The note read: '(Mrs Young) asked for £300 million (her offer starting at £1 billion).

'(I
am) ashamed to say, (I) stated that if Ronald Regan (sic) became the 
next US president (he was already dead), Jeremy Beadle (of You’ve Been 
Framed), walked through the door and the Tooth Fairy arrived, she could 
have the money.'

But property dealer Scot Young, 51, told Mr Justice Moor in the High Court that the offer was 'flippant' and 'ridiculous'.

He said he had been 'drinking heavily the night before' and was ashamed to say that he had made it.

He added: '(I apologise) for being so
flippant... (Mrs Young’s) suggestion was so ridiculous that (I) thought
(I) would make it even more ridiculous.'

Mr
Justice Moor said a lawyer’s note of the meeting showed that Mr Young 
had also made repeated references to the 1985 film Brewster’s Millions, which
starred Richard Pryor and John Candy.

'I was all over the place' Mr Young told the judge when questioned.

'I had been drinking heavily the night before.'

'(Mrs Young) asked for £300 million (her offer starting at £1 billion).

'(I
am) ashamed to say, (I) stated that if Ronald Regan (sic) became the 
next US president (he was already dead), Jeremy Beadle (of You’ve Been 
Framed), walked through the door and the Tooth Fairy arrived, she could 
have the money.'

Mr Young added: 'I was trying to say how ridiculous the situation was. I had no money and that was it.

Mr and Mrs Young are fighting over money at a trial in the Family Division of the High Court in London.

Mrs Young claims 'there was a vast fortune hidden' by Mr Young, who she separated from in 2006.

She says she is a victim of 'fraud' 
because Mr Young has manipulated his affairs so as to do her down - and 
wants her fair share. Mr Young disputes Mrs Young’s claims.

He says he is penniless and bankrupt and has debts which add up to £28 million.

Details
of the August 2009 offer emerged in a written 'opening note' that Mr 
Young, who is representing himself at the hearing, had prepared.

Mr Justice Moor said journalists could see the note - although Mr Young said he would 'rather they didn’t'.
