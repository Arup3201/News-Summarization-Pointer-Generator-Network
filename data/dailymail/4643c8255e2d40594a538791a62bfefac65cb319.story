My Kitchen Rules contestant Adam Anderson has been called a 'deadbeat dad' by his ex-wife in an explosive interview which also revealed the former tennis pro  is friends with show judge Pete Evans.

Cindy Anderson, Adam's former wife of almost 20 years, told A Current Affair on Monday night that her ex owes her tens of thousands of dollars in child support for their five children, aged between eight and 15 years of age.

Adam's ex said she feels no bitterness that he has moved on and re-married to Carol Molloy - his partner on the Channel 7 reality show - but she claims that's when her issues with child support payments began.

Cindy also claimed that Adam used to coach My Kitchen Rules judge Pete on the tennis court and that the pair worked together at his Kings Cross restaurant Hugo's, in Sydney, after she split with him.

'He has known Pete Evans, he knows him through tennis, through coaching him,' Cindy told reporter Brady Halls.

Owing child support? My Kitchen Rules contestant Adam Anderson's ex-wife, Cindy, told A Current Affair on Monday night that he owes their five children approximately twelve months worth of child support, amassing tens of thousands of dollars

'Deadbeat dad'? The former tennis professional is alleged to be providing his children with 'no financial support at all' according to his former wife

'We get no financial support at all,' she also told Brady.

Cindy claims her concern is  that the large sum owning to her has amassed over the past year, which she says 'worries me considerably in that my youngest is only 8 - he has many more years where he needs support from his father.'

'The children also have no emotional support from him. He does not ring them, nor come and see them,' she said, adding 'they do not receive a card [for birthdays] in the mail, not even a phone call.'

'He's never played an active, massive role in their lives anyway...but basically his role now is non-existent, he's pretty much wiped his hands clean of the children,' Cindy said.

Ranging in age: Their kids are aged between eight years and 15 years of age

Adam's ex also claimed that the lack of funds has reached a point where it's 'significantly impacting on the children', with the blonde single mother saying she's speaking on A Current Affair instead of dealing with the matter privately because 'He has blocked my number and both his childrens' numbers - the older two girls have phones'. 

Cindy not only took aim at Adam during the interview but also at the Child Support Agency and producers of My Kitchen Rules.

'It seems there is little they [child support agency] can do, irrespective of him being in the print that he's working at three private schools doing tennis, irrespective of his face being on My Kitchen Rules.

'They consistently say there is no source of collection, there is no avenue for us to collect revenue,' she said.

Making money? Cindy said she was most upset because her ex speaks of coaching at private schools but is allegedly unable to pay monies to his children

Spokesman and General Manager for the Department of Human services, who over-sees the Child Support Agency, Hank Jongen told Brady: 'I can't talk about individual cases but let me assure you, that we go to great lengths in order to enforce child support obligations.'

'We will do whatever it takes to recover that money,' he added.

While Cindy claims she wrote to producers of the show to find out if he was being paid for his appearances to garnish money from his wages, she was left without a response.

A Channel Seven spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia in response to Cindy's claims: 'This is a private matter between the parties involved.'  

Channel Seven also refuted the claim, that Adam and Pete are friends: 'They [Adam and Pete] met for the first time on the program'.
