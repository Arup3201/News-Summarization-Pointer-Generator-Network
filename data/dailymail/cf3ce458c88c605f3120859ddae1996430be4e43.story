Survivors of the Lampedusa shipwreck were forced to strip and be sprayed with disinfectant, shocking film footage has revealed.

In scenes reminiscent of World War Two concentration camps, the footage obtained by Italian television shows migrants at the detention centre on the EU’s southern-most landfall, standing naked in the open air, while waiting to be sprayed for scabies.

The mayor of Lampedusa, compared treatment of migrants in the refugee centre to ‘a concentration camp, or Auschwitz’.

Minister for the interior, Angelino Alfano, has announced an investigation.

Closer to Africa than mainland Europe, the island is the first port of call for many seeking a new life in Europe.

Since the Arab Spring began in 2011, chaotic conditions across swathes of North Africa have allowed tens of thousands to set sail for Europe often on unseaworthy wooden boats. Many die attempting the crossing.

The film shows at least two men at the detention centre standing with no clothes on, while others are undressing.

State television station RAI2 showed the video, which it said was shot by a migrant with a mobile phone, late on Monday.

The programme interviewed one of the migrants, identified only as Khalid, who said they were lined up and treated ‘like animals’.

The appalling footage has emerged two months after the tragic shipwreck that claimed the lives of more than 350 migrants including many women and children.

The boat, carrying mainly young Eritreans, caught fire and sank just half a mile off the coast after those aboard lit a blanket to attract attention from passing fishermen.

Mayor of Lampedusa Giusi Nicolini told Rai 2 television: ‘Italy should be ashamed. The system has to change. This is not what we were hoping to see just two months after the shipwrecks which provoked so much weeping, tears, commitments and promises.’

Speaker Laura Boldrini issued an angry statement saying that ‘stripping men and women naked outside in the middle of winter’ was ‘unworthy of a civilized country’.

Miss Boldrini added: ‘These images cannot leave us indifferent. All the more so because they come after the tragic shipwrecks of October and after the commitments that Italy made in terms of reception [of asylum seekers and migrants]. This kind of degrading treatment discredits the image of our country and demands dignified responses.’

After the tragic accident Italy was condemned for its ineptitude in policing the UK’s borders. But Italy said it was unable to cope with the influx and needed more support from other EU countries.
