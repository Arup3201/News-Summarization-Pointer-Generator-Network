Nigel Farage has become a trendsetter after a tie he wore sold out after he was seen wearing it in public.

The UKIP leader wore the distinctive Bayeux Tapestry tie during the Rochester by-election last week.

However people hoping to copy his look have been left disappointed after it sold out on a number of websites.

Some even admitted the lack of supplies was due to the 'Farage effect', suggesting the politician is emulating the likes of celebrities and the Duchess of Cambridge in setting the latest trends. 

And the tie may have been lucky for the leader as Mark Reckless, who recently defected from the Conservatives to UKIP, won last Thursday's by-election. 

Asked why he made the particular fashion decision, Mr Farage told the Telegraph: 'It was the last time we were invaded and taken over. 

'And there's a Norman keep here [at Rochester Castle]. I was looking through the tie rack this morning, and it seemed a sensible choice to me.'

The distinctive silk tie costs £25 from online retailer Fox and Chave, but is now listed as sold out on the website. 

It is printed with a pattern of the Bayeux Tapestry, which is a cloth that depicts the events leading up to the Norman conquest of England.

The 230ft long work is believed to have been made sometime after the Battle of Hastings in 1066, probably in a monastery. It is also sold by the British Museum for £30. 

In April the Duchess of Cambridge was seen wearing a yellow dress during the Royal tour of Australia and New Zealand. Sales of yellow items immediately increased by 95 per cent on eBay. 

A polka dot Topshop dress she wore during her pregnancy had a similar impact, selling out hours after she was seen wearing it. 

The first written record of the Bayeux Tapestry is in 1476.

It was described in the cathedral at Bayeux as 'a very long and narrow hanging on which are embroidered figures and inscriptions comprising a representation of the conquest of England.'

The Bayeux Tapestry is thought to have been commissioned in the 1070s by Bishop Odo of Bayeux, half-brother of William the Conqueror.

It is over 230 feet (70 metres) and tells the story of the final days of King Harold's encounter with William the Conqueror.

The tapestry consists of some fifty scenes with captions embroidered on linen with coloured woollen yarns.

Since it was 'rediscovered' by scholars in the 18th Century, its final scene - thought to show the coronation of William - has been missing.

According to legend, French revolutionary soldiers took it from the cathedral intending to cut it up to use as wagon covers.

In July this year stitchers in Alderney completed the missing final piece of the tapestry.

The new tapestry is the same height as the original, with four panels showing events following the Battle of Hastings
