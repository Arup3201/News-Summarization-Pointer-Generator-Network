Manchester United misfit Anderson is being pursued by clubs in Brazil who believe he can leave Old Trafford early on a free transfer.

The Brazilian midfielder is out of contract in the summer and free to talk to foreign clubs in January.

Flamengo wanted to sign him in August but could not agree a wage package on top of a fee.

His first club Gremio, however, are considered favourites this time and have held tentative discussions, with United happy to let him go.

They hope United will waive a nominal transfer fee in January to simply get Anderson off their books quickly.

Anderson was signed by Sir Alex Ferguson and well favoured by the former United boss but has failed to convince fans and coaches alike with lacklustre performances and a poor injury record.

He was sent on loan to Fiorentina by David Moyes but barely played and the Italians did not wish to take up an option to buy him in the summer.

He has had calf and hamstring trouble this season and barely figured in Louis van Gaal's plans.

Anderson was interviewed by Radio Bandeirantes and confirmed ongoing contact with Gremio and their rivals Internacional.

He said that when he was loaned to Fiorentina, he talked with Gremio's board.

'Gremio showed no interest. Gremio had its chance and still have it, but now its a matter of Gremio's board. I've been close to go to Gremio before, but the board didnt want me.'

Of Internacional's interest, he added: 'They called me. Inter has interest on me. I want to go back home, and any club in Brazil to be close to home.'
