A German princess has appeared in court after allegedly threatening to kill Muslims and calling police officers â€˜paedophilesâ€™.

Her Serene Highness Theodora-Louise, Prinzessin zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg, is accused of attacking three people at an event near St Andrews, Fife, where she is at university.

The 27-year-old, named on several lists of eligible single princesses, was led in handcuffs into Cupar Sheriff Court. She faces nine charges - including assault and acting in a racially aggravated manner.

The princess - who denies all of the charges - is understood to have been attending a student Oktoberfest event on Saturday, which is aimed at promoting cultural understanding.

She allegedly assaulted a man called Damon Creevy by kicking him and acted in a racially aggravated way towards a woman named Farah Hussain by making remarks about killing Muslims.

The incidents are believed to have taken place at Kinkell Farm, and the princess is also said to have kicked a woman called Cara Anderson, struggled with her and attempted to head-butt her.

At the event, which was raising money for Tayside Children with Cancer and Leukaemia, the princess is alleged to have made offensive and homophobic comments towards security staff.

She also denied charges of shouting, swearing and threatening violence and struggling violently with police officers.

The court heard yesterday that Sayn-Wittgenstein was supposed to return to Germany on Sunday, but had to rearrange her flights.

She was said to have fought against being placed in custody by pushing, shouting, swearing and threatening violence towards officers in a police van.

Then - according to the final charge - she shouted and swore at officers at Glenrothes Police Station on March 9, and accused them of being paedophiles.

The princess appeared in court in handcuffs, having spent the weekend in police cells in Glenrothes.

Defence solicitor Douglas Williams noted the Crown was not opposed to bail, provided the accused could give an address in Britain where she could be contacted. She provided one in London.

Mr Williams said she plans to return to Germany while she awaits trial to work with her father, Prince Ludwig, at his energy renewables business.

She was released on bail with the conditions of appearing at every calling of the case, does not commit any offences while on bail, and does not interfere with witnesses in the case.

She was also ordered not to behave in a manner likely to cause alarm or distress to witnesses. A trial at Dundee Sheriff Court was fixed for July 7.
