Pippa Middleton's 
first column for Waitrose magazine has been unveiled today, confirming the duchess' sister's ascent from party planner to professional foodie.

The
Asian feast boasts five recipes across five pages of the glossy 
magazine, all of which have been tried and tested by Pippa herself.

And while many were braced for the 
sort of facile recipes that were so roundly criticised when Pippa 
released her much-lampooned guide to entertaining last year, here there 
are plenty of ideas for the budding chef - and even the more experienced home cook - to get their teeth into - even if there is very little real cooking involved.

But a closer look at the recipes - using many exotic ingredients that would cost around £115 to buy from scratch - reveals that the portions allocated for each diner are, for a meal termed a 'feast', actually minute. To double up would be to incur costs of £215 for one meal.

Pippa
Middleton's first column has been unveiled - will it silence the 
critics who didn't think the duchess's sister had anything to offer the 
Waitrose customer?

Some of the ideas have merit. There's an interesting take on a 
classic cocktail in the shape of a ginger mojito garnished with red chilli and fresh mint.

Some rather attractive 
looking Vietnamese spring rolls use ready-cooked prawns and require assembly only. Simple, yes. Demanding zero expertise in the kitchen, yes. But also tasty and 
impressive as a light starter. Although make no mistake: they need plenty of careful 
attention to look as good as Pippa's.

There are traditional hoisin duck rolls too, which as Pippa says, go down a storm. 'Make sure you make more than you think you'll need', she counsels - although at £4 a pack for the duck breast, and with four packs needed to double up on the recipe to allow for those extras, that makes £16 spent on duck alone.

Omelette sushi, which Pippa says she used to make while at Edinburgh University (none of the usual Pot Noodles and corned beef hash for Pip's pals then) is a less enticing prospect.

Fine for student fodder, the egg, red pepper or smoked salmon-filled rice rolls are not likely to impress too many guests at a more accomplished dinner party chef's Friday Night Feast.

The Eastern feast is rounded off with tangerine and sake jellies with coconut cream, which involves juicing two 600g bags of tangerines - fine if you are a socialite with plenty of time on your hands; a bind if you have three children demanding their Turkey Twizzlers and a go on your iPad.

Still, the jelly - a fruity concoction of tangerines, sake and fresh mint tempered with a swirl of rich coconut cream - certainly sounds enticing enough to have bags of fruit and cans of coconut flying off the shelves, which is surely half the point.

The only drawback is that this seems to be lacking the main event. With just one spring roll, a couple of small duck pancakes and a jelly as sustenance, let's hope guests aren't drinking more than the welcome mojito.

Pippa introduces her new column saying that Friday night is the 'perfect time to cook.'

'Regardless of how tired I might be, the moment Friday lunchtime arrives I get that contagious pre-weekend excitement,' she says.

'Fridays, of course, hold the promise of the weekend but also, being far enough away from pre-Monday melancholy, feel freer.

'All of which is why Friday, rather than Saturday, is the night to feast!'

William Sitwell, editor of Waitrose magazine, defended his newest columnist, calling her 'fantastic' and 'tremendous'

Pippa explains her decision to pick an Asian feast for her first column, saying she has always loved the flavours from countries like Vietnam, China and Japan.

Pippa includes a disclaimer, saying that while some of the elements of the feast may seem 'too fussy' to make at home, the recipes actually require 'no Chinatown trips' and 'hardly any cooking'.

Ahead of the column's publication, 
critics expressed their fears that the young novice would have nothing 
to offer the Waitrose customer.

But with these recipes, which - with 
the exception of the hoisin duck rolls - are outside the repertoire of 
most Middle England housewives - will surely inspire experimentation at 
some level among the footsure client base.

The culinary skills of Pippa 
Middleton were defended by the editor of Waitrose magazine, who 
responded to critics who said the young novice had nothing to offer the 
Waitrose customer.

William Sitwell called Pippa 
'tremendous', and said that Pippa's Friday Night Feasts would be 'fantastic'. 
He accused her doubters of being jealous of her good fortune and skills.

He
went on to compare Kate's sister's ideas to those of Cordon 
Bleu-trained chef Yotam Ottolenghi and Ben Tish, the man behind one of 
London's leading tapas restaurants, Salt Yard.

Speaking to local radio station Siren FM, Sitwell said:
'She's on tremendous form. The first column comes out next week so we 
can expect the usual flurry of abuse from newspapers and food bloggers 
who are jealous that they haven't got columns.

'In the mix of the magazine, her 
stuff is fantastic. She's there alongside Yotam Ottolenghi and some 
other up-and-coming chefs like Ben Tish from Salt Yard.

'You'll
still see an array of talent that we use. She's done her very first 
series as an Asian-themed Friday night feast and I think people will 
enjoy it. When people see the work that she's doing, they'll calm down.'

And you certainly cannot fault Pippa's enthusiasm. In the final line of her introductory words, she says she can 'feel the Friday energy already'.

'Friends released from work, hair down, ties loosened and heels clattering in an excited scramble - especially if it's to my place!'.

Pippa Middleton released her first book, 
party-planning guide Celebrate, in October 2012, but has since parted 
ways with her literary agent after the tome did not sell well

Pippa released her first book - a guide 
to party-planning, which did include several recipes - in October last 
year. But she has since parted ways with her agent.

Celebrate:
A Year of British Festivities For Families and Friends reportedly 
netted Pippa a £400,000 advance from publisher Michael Joseph.  

But her agent David Godwin last week 
confirmed that he and the middle child of the Middleton family were no 
longer working together.

Pippa also runs her own online magazine, Party Times, an offshoot of her family's Party Pieces business.
