They're meant to be our brightest and best, but these incredible exam blunders don't earn the country's university swats any marks.

They were however rewarded with a place in the Times Higher Education Supplement’s annual hall of shame.

The worst offender will be announced next week, but here are a few of the contest's top entries.

Some students took the questions literally

If a University of Ulster student is to be believed, 'In the future all cars will be fitted with a Catholic converter.'

And it's hard to know whether this student, also from Ulster, was joking or not when they wrote: 'The hole in the ozone layer was caused by a***holes.'

One student from Kings College London wrote 'Most books were written on Valium', but they meant vellum

Similarly, an Aston University student got the wrong spelling here, but may have had a point when they answered: 'The coalition government apparently has a toff stance on tax avoidance.

Meanwhile a Canterbury Christ Church University student didn't underestimate the 2010 World Cup soothsayer when they wrote: 'Octopuses are intelligent because they have been found to be able to predict the winners of football matches in the World Cup.'

The predictions came from Paul the Octopus.

Another had good news for vertically challenged people when they wrote: 'Globalisation has led to a growing interconnectedness between small scale people and larger scale cities.'

A history student from University of Exeter explained there was more going on in coffee shops in 18th century London that meets the eye, writing: 'Within these coffeehouses, men from all different parts of the world could interfere with each other.'

Meanwhile this student couldn't tell their suppository from their repository, writing: '(Google is) one of the two main suppositories of data in the world.'

And food was definitely on the mind for this Canterbury Christ Church University student when they declared 'In 1945 Stalin began to build a buffet zone in Eastern Europe.'

Here a history student deftly summed up 2,000 years of history by writing: 'Jesus was probably the main factor the American Civil War was fought the way it was. Not only was Jesus super cool he was really smart. He was born in 1923.'

Another tried to bring American rapper Tupac into it, stating: 'Christopher Columbus was a famous explorer who went to the 'New World' on the order of the President. He and his trusty crew mates - Maria, Santa Maria and Tupac.'

This history student was clearly clueless, but decided to have a stab at the question anyway, stating: 'Spain was a very Catholic country since Christianity had been taken there in the third century BC'.

Another claimed people wanted to live near power lines - to get electricity faster.

And a City University student said the failure of Northern Rock bank was due to 'laxative enforcement policies', though they may have been referring to all that money that went down the toilet.

The winning entry will be announced in next week’s Times Higher Education Supplement.

'In the future all cars will be fitted with a Catholic converter,' said a University of Ulster student.

'The hole in the ozone layer was caused by a***holes', wrote another University of Ulster student who meant 'aerosols'.

'Hitler's role in the Second World War is often overlooked' -  said a University of Herts student.

'The coalition government has a toff stance on tax avoidance', said an Aston University student.

'Octopuses are intelligent because they have been found to be able to predict the winners of football matches during the World Cup', wrote a Canterbury Christ Church University student in reference to Paul the Octopus from the 2010 tournament.

'Globalisation has led to a growing interconnectedness between small scale people and larger scale cities', from a University of Southampton student.

'Within these coffee houses, men from all different parts of the world could interfere with each other' - a University of Exeter student's verdict on 18th century London.

'(Google is) one of the two main suppositories of data in the world.' The University of Sheffield candidate got suppository muddled up with repository.

'In 1945 Stalin began to build a buffet zone in Eastern Europe',  said a history student at Canterbury Christ Church University.

'Spain was a very Catholic country since Christianity had been taken there in the third century BC,' reckoned a history student at the University of Liverpool.

'Most books were written on valium', but the King's College student meant vellum.

A City University London student said the failure of Northern Rock bank was due to 'laxative enforcement policies'.

When asked for the four P's of marketing, a student at Plumpton College said 'Product, Price, Place and Distribution'.

Writing about 'laboratory theatre' a student said an actor was 'straining in their role in the lavatory theatre'.

A food science student at King's College London suggested instigating a 'genital mixing action'.

Trying to explain the phrase 'some people don't look up until they are flat on their backs' a school pupil wrote: 'Some people can't look up because something has happened to their necks. For example, if a person gets kicked in the neck by a kung fu midget.'

When asked 'how many siblings do you have?', one pupil said, 'two - they have hair'.

Another wrote 'Jesus was probably the main factor the American Civil War was fought the way it was. Not only was Jesus super cool he was really smart. He was born in 1923.'

'Christopher Columbus was a famous explorer who went to the new world on the order of the president. He and his trusty crew mates - Maria, Santa Maria, and Tupac,' declared one pupil, accidentally referring to the American rapper.

When asked what is meant by the term hermaphrodite,  one pupil answered 'Lady Gaga.'

When questioned why people would want to live near power lines, a pupil stated 'because you get your electricity faster'.
