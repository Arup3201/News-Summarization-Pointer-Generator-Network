After first one, and then both, of her older sisters were diagnosed with breast cancer, Marianne Corr refused to take any chances.

Identical twins Louise Hughes and Amanda Ford elected to have double mastectomies to prevent the disease returning, and Miss Corr bravely resolved to do the same – despite being perfectly healthy.

But while tests confirmed that her 43-year-old siblings were carriers of the faulty BRCA2 gene which causes breast cancer, it turned out Miss Corr was not.

Louise Hughes (left), Amanda Ford (centre) and Marianne Corr (right) have all had double mastectomies. Twins Ms Hughes and Ms Ford, 43, both carry the BRCA gene and both developed breast cancer

Despite that, she says she has no 
regrets about her surgery. In fact, the three sisters believe their 
ordeals have brought them closer together.

The 40-year-old telesales worker 
said: ‘I decided I didn’t want my breasts. I was offered counselling, 
but no counselling in the world would have made me change my mind.

‘It was the best decision I ever made. Now I don’t have to worry. I don’t have to wait for it to happen to me.’

There had been no history of breast 
cancer in the family before Mrs Hughes, a mother of three who runs her 
own company preparing venues for events, was diagnosed with the disease 
in 2005.

After seeing what her sisters had been through, Ms Corr decided that she should also undergo a double mastectomy. She later discovered that she does not carry the faulty gene

Mrs Hughes, then 35, decided to have a
 double mastectomy at Queen’s Hospital in the sisters’ home town of 
Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, followed by immediate reconstructive 
surgery in Birmingham.

Five years later, Mrs Ford, who runs a gardening business with husband Hadyn, was also diagnosed with the disease.

She was told she would have to have 
one breast removed because of the size of her tumour, leaving her 
‘devastated’. But after doctors told her she carried the faulty gene, 
which meant there was an 80 per cent chance of the disease returning, 
the mother of two asked them to remove the other breast as well.

She said: ‘I had helped Louise 
through the tough times and knew that she would do the same for me, and 
that I would beat the cancer just as she had. We were close before and 
this has just strengthened our sisterhood.’

Ms Hughes and Ms Ford are both now free from the disease and Ms Corr says she does not regret having the surgery as even without the faulty genes women have a one in eight chance of developing breast cancer

A cell needs to have a number of mistakes in its genetic code before it becomes cancerous.

Doctors call these mistakes faults or mutations.

They can occur due to substances people come into contact with. Or, they can happen because of mistakes that cells make when copying their genetic code before dividing into two new cells.

Most of these abnormal cells die or are killed off by the immune system. It usually takes many years to gather enough genetic mistakes to cause cancer.

But it is possible to be born with a gene fault that increases the risk of cancer.

Scientists have identified a number of these so-called 'cancer genes'.

The first genes to be found were BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 - women with these genes have a 50 to 80 per cent chance of getting breast cancer in their lifetime.

Women who tests positive can either have regular breast screenings or have surgery to remove their breasts (and possibly ovaries).

In between the twins’ diagnoses, 
their mother, Pilar Corr, had a pre-cancerous lump removed, and was 
found to carry the faulty gene. A cousin was also diagnosed with breast 
cancer.

By the time Mrs Ford was diagnosed, 
Miss Corr had made up her mind to follow the twins down the surgery 
route. She had the operation in June 2011. Weeks afterwards she decided 
to take the blood test too, which established she was not a carrier of 
the faulty gene.

Miss Corr, who is separated from the father of her three children, said: ‘Genetic or not genetic, I didn’t want my breasts.

‘The test was irrelevant. I had the op before I had the test and it wouldn’t have made any difference, whatever it had said.

‘It was just the fear of it happening
 to me. It was something  I always thought about and I’d been paranoid 
about it since I was about 25.’

The faulty gene can be passed down family lines, increasing the risk of cancer.

But the absence of it did not mean 
Miss Corr would never develop the disease, as it accounts for only a 
small proportion of cases.

She said the sisters were speaking 
out now to publicise a ball they have organised to raise money for 
Queen’s Hospital, where each of them had their operations.

Their younger brother, Andrew, 32, who is in the Royal Navy, has not been tested for the gene.

Last month, Hollywood actress 
Angelina Jolie, 38, revealed she had undergone a pre-emptive double 
mastectomy after tests confirmed she carried the faulty BRCA1 gene.

It meant she had a 87 per cent chance of contracting breast cancer and a 50 per cent chance of contracting ovarian cancer.
