The father of a young footballer whose team had just put in an incredible cup-winning performance has died after having a suspected heart attack as he watched from the side of the pitch.

Tragically Jack Kelly, 59, collapsed at the end
of the Scottish Communities League Cup final at Hampden Park as his Kilmarnock midfielder son Liam Kelly, 22, achieved the crowning moment of his career so far.

As elated players celebrated their against the odds victory over giants Celtic, paramedics treated Mr Kelly near the Kilmarnock dugout and his distraught son was spotted sprinting from the field to be by his father's side.

The 22-year-old was then seen is tears and had to be held up by bystanders.

Mr Kelly was taken to hospital in Glasgow yesterday, where he died around an hour later.

Kilmarnock's players were not told of the incident until after they lifted the trophy, but players were seen in floods of tears soon afterwards.

The dramatic incident came on the same weekend Bolton Wanderers midfielder Fabrice Muamba had to be treated on the pitch after his heart stopped during his team's FA Cup quarter final against Spurs.

Muamba is still critically ill in a London hospital.

A spokesman for Strathclyde Police confirmed Mr Kelly collapsed at about 4.55pm yesterday.

'He was conveyed to Glasgow Victoria Infirmary where he succumbed at about 5.45pm,' the spokesman added.

In the post-match press conference, Kilmarnock manager Kenny Shiels said: “The dressing room is very despondent and I don’t know why the man above sends down these messages to us.

'We are thinking more about Liam than our triumphalism.'

It is the first time the team has won the cup.

After the game, Kilmarnock goalkeeper Cammy Bell said: 'I’m very close to Liam so it just puts things into perspective for me.

'If I could take away my performance I would, if Liam’s dad was all right.'

Kelly was told about the heart attack before Kilmarnock lifted the trophy but the rest of his team-mates had collected their medals before discovering the news.

'It was after getting the cup when I found out,' Bell said. 'We were on the pitch and the kit man told me. The rest of the boys didn’t realise.'
