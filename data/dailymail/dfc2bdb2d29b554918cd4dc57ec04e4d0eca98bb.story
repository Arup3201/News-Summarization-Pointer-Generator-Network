The driver who killed a young couple in Boston in June will spend six months behind bars after he pleaded guilty to two counts of motor vehicle homicide in court on Friday.

Mohamed Alfageeh, 30, was sentenced to two years in total behind bars for the deaths of Jessica Campbell, 27, and John Lanzillotti Jr., 28, after he caused a car accident which claimed their lives.

Before Suffolk Superior Court Judge Carol Ball sentenced Alfageeh, his attorney, John Seed, said that his client accepted resposibility for the crash on Beacon Street in Boston on June 21, the longest day of the year.

Tragedy: Jessica Campbell, 27, and John Lanzillotti Jr., 28, lost their lives in a car crash in Boston on June 21

Judge Ball spoke to the mothers of the couple and took into consideration their feelings before passing down the sentence.

According to the Boston Globe, Campbell's mother reminded Ball that she had spent 10 years trying to conceive Jessica and her loss is unfathomable.

'I don’t have the words to tell you how shattered we are,’ she said to Ball. 'My children are everything to me … She was a happy kid, a good student, and she grew up to be a beautiful young woman.’

Surprisingly, Campbell's mother, Ronnie, has declared herself free of anger towards Alfageeh.

'My sense of grief and loss supersedes any sense of anger,’ she said according to the Boston Globe.
