A former boxer wanted for killing a 36-year-old Connecticut woman early Tuesday morning has been found shot dead in his Rockville home, police said. 

Philip Gilberti, 51, is believed to have fired the fatal shot himself. Police said they found his gun lying close to his body.

Detectives on Tuesday launched an urgent 100-strong manhunt to try to find him in connection with the death of his ex-wife, Heather Lynn McGuire earlier that day.

She was shot dead at around 9.40am on Tuesday. Police believe she was driving in a van with Gilberti when they had an argument, making him the lead suspect in her death. 

At least one witness reported that it looked like the woman tried to get out but that the man pulled her back in and shot her, he said. After the woman fell to the road, the van sped off.

Bystanders, and later police officers, tried to save McGuire as she lay in the street, but she died at the scene.

In the three days before the shooting, Gilberti was twice taken into custody after allegedly threatening McGuire.

Both times he was released on bond on orders that he remain away from her.

Scared: McGuire's father, George Horman, told ABC7 that she left Gilberti after suffering longstanding domestic abuse

Her father, George Horman, told ABC7 that McGuire left Gilberti after suffering longstanding domestic abuse: ‘She was scared to death of him,’ he said. 

‘One day she just come here crying saying “I’ve got to get away from him, he’s going to kill me”. She was just that scared of him. He’s just mean.’

Gilberti was due in court Tuesday morning on allegations that he assaulted McGuire at a home in Aspen Hill, but he never showed up.

Friends told the news channel that when they returned to the home from court they found a horrific scene. The back door was kicked in and McGuire was gone.

‘There was blood all over the sheets pillows in the bedroom and everything was torn up like a brawl and her car was gone,’ one friend said.

Gilberti, a former professional boxer, had a dark history of violence. He was arrested in 1992 for robbery, in 1993 for theft and reckless endangerment, in 1994 for battery, in 1995 for stalking.

In 1996 he was charged with attempted murder in Nevada, pleaded to a lesser charge and served 10 years in prison. The first of several charges involving victim McGuire was in 2005.
