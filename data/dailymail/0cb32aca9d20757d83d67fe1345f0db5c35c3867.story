George Osborne today rolled up his sleeves to prepare afternoon tea for the finance ministers from some of the world's leading economies.

The Chancellor joined members of the Women's Institute to butter scones for G& politicians and central bankers.

Hosting a two-day summit at a country house in Buckinghamshire, Mr Osborne issue a blunt warning that global economic recovery is not guaranteed.

Mr Osborne said more needs to be done to 
‘nurture’ an international revival. He
 said progress was being made in securing growth, but cautioned: ‘The 
challenge is not to falter in the difficult steps we need to take to 
make that recovery sustainable and lasting.’

Britain this year holds the chairmanship of the G7, which also includes France, the USA, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan.

Banking reforms will top the agenda for the two-day meeting at the grand Hartwell House in Buckinghamshire.

Ahead
 of the talks Mr Osborne said: ‘Our meeting takes place at a time of 
greater economic stability, thanks to policy action taken. Markets have 
calmed, and there are signs that this is feeding through into greater 
confidence.

‘But we cannot 
take the global recovery for granted. We must guard against weakening 
our resolve to confront the collective challenges we face.’

Mr Osborne has been boosted by better than expected predictions of growth in the UK.

The
 Chancellor went jogging early this morning before hosting a meeting of 
ministers and central bank governors from the G7 nations.

The National Institute of 
Economic and Social Research said output rose by 0.8 per cent between  
February and April – the most since the Olympics. The report fuels hopes
 for growth after the country came close to a triple-dip recession.

The
 influential NIESR think tank warned the economy will not reach its 2008
 peak until 2015, but the figures suggest a move in the right direction.

The
 Office for National Statistics said manufacturing output rose 1.1 per 
cent in March and 0.7 per cent in  February, the first back-to-back rise
 in two years.

Analysts 
said it could lead to an upgrade of figures showing gross domestic 
product grew by 0.3 per cent in the first three months of the year.

Chancellor George Osborne, who was out running early this morning, is hosting a meeting of G7 finance ministers to plot a global economic recovery

Mr Osborne warned against weakening resolve to secure growth, saying economic recovery should not be taken for granted

Mr Osborne said the leading economies had to focus on ‘the three pillars of monetary activism, fiscal responsibility, and structural reform’.

He plans to use the UK's chairmanship to make the meeting less formal in a bid to increase flexibility at the talks, which will initially focus on the global economy.

Mr Osborne wants to see worldwide agreements to end the idea of some banks being ‘too big to fail’, while also tackling tax evasion and avoidance.

Hundreds of ultra-wealthy Britons are being investigated for tax evasion following the exposure of their secret offshore accounts, it emerged yesterday.

International spy agencies are thought to have helped obtain a 'goldmine' of data that names high-profile multi-millionaires and their financial advisers.

The files show how the rich have hidden billions in Singapore, the British Virgin Islands and the Caymans.

More than 100 individuals have been identified so far – and have already been sent warning letters by HM Revenue & Customs.

Mr Osborne said of the data: 'The message is simple: if you evade tax we're coming after you. This data is another weapon in HMRC's arsenal.'

The Chancellor has previously expressed shock at the extent to which the wealthy were exploiting tax loopholes.

Ahead of the G7 meeting, Mr Osborne said: ‘Our task is to nurture the recovery. Our challenge is not to falter in the difficult steps we need to take to make that recovery sustainable and lasting.’

He added: ‘Countries can do much together to improve our economies. We are not powerless victims of global forces - but can be masters of our own destiny.

‘We have shown political will to tackle problems at home - and I believe the UK is further along that road than many. Now we can together show the political will to nurture global economic recovery.

‘We have more in common than separates us. The G7 can be a catalyst for collective action to the benefit of all.’

Mr Osborne acknowledged that debt and deficit levels ‘are too high’ in the UK, as well as other G7 economies and called for fresh resolve to tackle the problem.
