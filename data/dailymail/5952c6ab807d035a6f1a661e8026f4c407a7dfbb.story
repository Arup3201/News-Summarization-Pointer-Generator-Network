A promising jockey took a dramatic tumble at Cheltenham today when she was thrown off her horse, moments ahead of winning the race.

Jane Mangan, 19, had jumped the final fence on Oscar 
Delta and was powering to the winning post when 
the horse jinked to the left, sending the her tumbling to the ground.

The Irish amateur rider appeared uninjured and quickly got to her feet clutching her helmet in disappointment.

So far so good: Oscar Delta looked unbeatable approaching the line...

... but after jinking to the left he collided with the rail and there was no way back for Jane Mangan....

...and it was left to Salsify to claim the honours

Recovering after her fall Miss Mangan compared her fall to a 'Disney film'.

'When I hit the ground I thought I was dreaming. He jinked to the left 
thinking he had to go round for another circuit. I corrected him but I 
was not ready for that and that was my fault.'

The promising teen also recognised 
that losing a race paled into significance beside the injuries suffered 
by fellow amateur JT McNamara on Thursday.

The 37-year-old fractured two 
vertebrae in his neck when seriously injured in a fall on the third day 
of the Cheltenham Festival.

'It could be a lot worse,' Miss Mangan said. 'We are all in pieces about what has happened to Massa (JT McNamara).'

Hot prospect: Although today's fall hurt her pride, Jane Mangan is tipped for big things

'She has hurt only her pride,' 
her father Jimmy said after the race.

'She's 100 per cent. She gave the horse a brilliant ride. I could not be more 
proud of her.'

Jimmy Mangan, who trained Monty's Pass to Grand National success, was heard talking to his daughter on the track.

'Pull yourself together, you could be like JT.'

The dramatic fall of Miss Mangan left favourite horse Salsify on his own for a facile second success in a row in the Foxhunters' Chase, known as the amateurs' Gold Cup.

Jockey Barry Geraghty watched Miss Mangan's fall in amazement as he rode Salsify to victory.

Speaking after the race he said that although it wasÂ  the biggest day of his career, his thoughts were with friend McNamara.

'I just wish it were a happier day because we are all very upset about John Thomas,' Geraghty said.

Head in hands: Jane Mangan can't believe her bad luck after crashing off Oscar Delta in the Foxhunter Chase

Just her pride that's hurt: Mangan after the fall that cost her victory in the Foxhunter Chase

'You have to put it out of your mind
when you're racing but even though this is one of the biggest days of 
my career all I could think about was him.

'He's a friend of ours and I 
hope and pray he will be okay. I dedicate this victory to him, if that 
does any good.'

Victory in the race prior to the 
Gold Cup for wealthy Irish owner J P McManus gave him the opportunity to
speak eloquently about the contrasting emotions produced by the ups and
downs of racing.

'It is nice to win and nice to be here,' he said, 'but it's difficult to celebrate when our friend is in our prayers.'

McManus, who also enjoyed a first and
second in the final race of the meeting, had early that morning 
arranged for his private helicopter to transfer the McNamara family from
their homes to be at their son's hospital bedside in Bristol.
