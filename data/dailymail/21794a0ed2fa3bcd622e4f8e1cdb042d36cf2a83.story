Shantelle Clarke has life-threatening injuries following the 70ft fall on Saturday

This is the 15-month-old girl who survived a horrifying 70ft plunge from her tower-block bedroom.

Shantelle Clarke has life-threatening internal injuries after the fall, which her family has blamed on faulty child safety locks fitted to her window.

Her distraught parents, Chelsea Westgate, 18, and 23-year-old Craig Clarke, remained at her hospital bedside last night as her condition was described as critical but stable.

The couple, who also have a three-year-old son, Kurtis, are believed to have been asleep in another room in the fifth-floor flat at the time of the fall at 8.30am on Saturday in Plymouth.

Yesterday, Shantelle’s family hit back at suggestions that her parents, who are engaged and expecting a third child, were to blame.

Miss Westgate’s grandmother Doreen Pegg, 75, said: ‘Chelsea and Craig were in bed when it happened and Kurtis and Shantelle were playing in their bedroom.

'I think there must have been something wrong with the safety latch on the window when she fell but no one really knows. It was an awful accident which could have happened to any parent.’

The child’s aunt, Kelly Westgate, claimed on her Facebook page that the incident was down to the ‘window’s safety lock not kicking in’ despite the parents being told they were safe.

Another relative, Kerri Phillips, claimed the locks were recently changed and had not been fitted properly.

Shantelle's parents Chelsea and Craig are at her bedside at hospital where she is in intensive care. Her family said child locks on the window were faulty and did not work

Shantelle’s grandfather Ian Clarke, 48, who is looking after Kurtis, said: ‘Craig and Chelsea are fantastic parents and are devastated about this. They are in no way to blame.

'This was an accident and it’s upsetting that anybody could think otherwise.

‘Shantelle is in a really bad way and is currently in intensive care. It doesn’t look like she’ll be coming out any time soon.

'We’re all just hoping she’s going to be OK as she’s such a happy and bubbly little girl.’

The past year has been a difficult one for the family.

The couple are believed to have been asleep in another room of the fifth-floor flat when Shantelle fell

They escaped an arson attack next to the 
flat in October which left them homeless for several months, and in 
February they were burgled.

Police and child protection officers are believed to be talking to Sanctuary Housing, the firm that owns the six-storey block of flats in the Barne Barton area of Plymouth.

A police spokesman said they were not treating the incident as suspicious.

Sanctuary Housing refused to comment on concerns over the child safety locks but managing director Simon Clark said: ‘We are doing all we can to assist the police in their investigations and our thoughts are with the family at this difficult time.’
