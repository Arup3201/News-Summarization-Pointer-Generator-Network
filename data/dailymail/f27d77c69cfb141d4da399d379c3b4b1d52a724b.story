It's not the most complex of artistic creations and it certainly doesn't resemble anything British.

But artist Damien Hirst has decorated this year's Brit Award trophy with multicoloured polka dots.

Superseding the likes of Dame Vivienne Westwood and Sir Peter Blake, he has replaced the Union Jack colours with his signature design.

He is the third creative icon to be asked to stylise the trophy, adding the dots which he has used in many of his well-known artworks.

His spots have been applied to numerous canvases and even a car over the years.

Hirst said he had been 'honoured' to be asked to give the trophy a makeover.

'It has become such an iconic award, I love the Brits,' he said.

The award has been unveiled ahead of tonight's announcement of the Brits shortlists.

Tom Odell, the winner of this year's 
critics' choice prize, will get his hands on the trophy first when the 
2012 winner Emeli Sande hands over the prize at the launch in London's 
Savoy Hotel tonight.

Brits chairman David Joseph said: 'Damien is truly one of the most important British artists and his 
reimagining of the statue will make winning a 2013 Brits an even more 
special proposition.'

Last year Sir Blake based the trophy on the three colours of the Union Jack flag, and his artistic creation echoed the swinging sixties, the decade when he first rose to prominence.

It was the second year the Brits asked a British creative icon to style the blank canvas trophy, following Dame Vivienne Westwood's success the previous year.

Dame Vivienne
draped the statue in a Union Jack, and the trophy had the phrase 'Stop!
Climate Change' at the bottom, flagging up the environmental campaign 
for which the designer is a tireless campaginer.

Hirst's
exhibition at Tate Modern last year was the most popular solo show ever
staged at the gallery, attracting around 463,000 visitors, and helping 
the venue to record numbers through its doors.

The gallery on London's Southbank recorded a 9.5per cent increase in visitor numbers, making 2012 the busiest year in its history with a record-breaking 5.3 million people walking through its doors.

The Hirst exhibition, which ran from April to early September, featured the artist's diamond-encrusted human skull For The Love Of God,  a rotting cow's head and a shark suspended in formaldehyde.

Other highlights of the show, seen by an average of almost 3,000 visitors a day, were A Thousand Years 1990 where flies emerge from maggots, eat from a rotting cow's head and die, and The Physical Impossibility Of Death In The Mind Of Someone Living where a shark is suspended in formaldehyde.

Around 1.5 million people visited Tate Britain in Pimlico, central London over the same period, up 4.3per cent on 2011.

Tate deputy director Alex Beard said: 'It has been an extraordinary year at Tate Modern, opening the world's first museum galleries permanently dedicated to exhibiting live art, performance, installation and film works alongside an outstanding exhibition programme which has undoubtedly fuelled the increase in visitors.'
