Prince Harry has been spotted smoking from a shisha pipe onboard a yacht in Abu Dhabi.

The photograph shows the 30-year-old royal trying the flavoured tobacco on the boat, which was docked in the United Arab Emirates city’s marina for the Mahiki F1 Yacht Party.

Harry was pictured dressed casually with seven others as he smoked the hookah - which is legal - after watching Lewis Hamilton win his second Formula One World Championship.

World Health Organisation research into hookah pipes shows that the average  session lasts around an hour - and in that time the smoker can inhale the same amount of smoke as from 100 cigarettes.

Boat party: Prince Harry, 30, was spotted smoking from a shisha pipe onboard a yacht in Abu Dhabi after he watched Lewis Hamilton win the Formula One World Championship

The image - released by London agency Clickstarpics and first published by Los Angeles website TMZ - comes after Harry became the first to congratulate Hamilton on his win over the in-car radio.

He told him: ‘Lewis, thank you very much for not making the British public sweat. You are a legend.’

Last week a study found how fumes from the water pipes of hookahs - used to smoke flavoured tobacco - contain the toxin benzene, which has been linked to an increased risk for leukaemia.

Researchers have warned of an impending health epidemic caused by a huge rise in the number of students smoking hookahs.

The British Heart Foundation says: 'Some people mistakenly think that shisha smoking is not addictive because the water used in the pipe can absorb nicotine. In reality, because only some of the nicotine is absorbed by the water, shisha smokers are still exposed to enough nicotine to cause an addiction'.

The fourth in line to the throne, who last week enjoyed a successful three-day mini tour of Arabia - including raising almost £1 million at a charity polo match - spent last weekend enjoying himself.

With the great, the good and the fabulously wealthy flocking into the UAE, Harry was in his element, drinking and dancing into the early hours as well as posing for pictures with scores of admirers.

Social media such as Twitter and Instagram were awash with pictures of the partying prince earlier this week. One showed him cuddled up to a group of exotic young women, comically grimacing.

Another video showed the royal, his white shirt unbuttoned a straw hat perched on his head, launching into a wild dance on the deck of a super yacht.

One user posted a picture saying: 'Can't believe I just seen Prince Harry twerking and I didn't record it. Oh my god, can't believe it. What a guy!'

If the scenes reminded onlookers of his infamous jaunt to Las Vegas in 2012,  then there was even more reason.

For both then and now, he was accompanied by one of his 'partying partners in crime', Adam Bidwell, an ex-London Welsh rugby playing stockbroker and former boyfriend of singer Katherine Jenkins.

Hookahs are water pipes used to smoke tobacco flavours such as apple, mint and cherry - and smoking is often done in groups, with the same mouthpiece passed between people.

While their use began centuries ago in ancient Persia and India, hookahs are gaining popularity in cafés around the world - including in Britain, the Middle East and the US.

In one hookah session - lasting from 20 to 80 minutes - you can inhale the same amount of smoke as a cigarette smoker using more than 100 cigarettes, according to a World Health Organization study.

He was also accompanied by the same Scotland Yard police protection officer who was pictured next to Harry in a jacuzzi at a pool party in the City of Sin.

Also in the official group staying in Abu Dhabi over the weekend was Harry's private secretary, Edward Lane-Fox, and a member of the Kensington Palace press office - although there is no suggestion either of them were on the yacht.

Other pictures to emerge from the weekend show Harry posing with a rapper and socialising at what is described in the Abu Dhabi social pages as the most 'star-studded destination' of the Grand Prix, Amber Lounge.

Harry stayed on to watch the Grand Prix privately after his official duties had concluded. His cousin, Princess Beatrice, and uncle, Prince Andrew, also showed up in Abu Dhabi over the weekend.

The release of the image comes two years after Prince Harry's infamous wild night in Las Vegas in August 2012, when he was pictured naked in a hotel room during a game of 'strip billiards'.  

A palace spokesman for Harry declined to immediately comment when contacted by MailOnline.
