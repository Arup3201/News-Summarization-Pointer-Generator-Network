The Big Apple offers some of the best bargains for Britons looking to save on their Christmas shopping, according to a survey.

And those looking for trips to festive markets in Europe should head for Prague, another poll suggests.

Both surveys are from Post Office Travel Money which found that top fashion items can be as much as 73 per cent cheaper in New York than in London.

Best bargains: Shoppers in New York this Christmas will find presents are up to 73% cheaper

Price comparison: How London prices fare against New York

Hollister men's designer jeans, for example, cost £59 in London but can be as little as £16 in New York.

While there is a 62 per cent saving on New York True Religion super skinny jeans (£107) compared with a pair purchased in London (£280).

Items such as skin creams, shirts, hoodies, cardigans, dolls and bras are also far less pricey in New York than in London.

The guide also sounds a word of caution. While fashion items are invariably cheaper in New York, prices for perfumes are generally higher.

The new My Burberry Eau de Parfum (50ml) costs two per cent more in New York than in London (over £66 compared with £65). 

However, researchers did find that Marc Jacobs new Daisy Dream Eau de Toilette (100ml) costs 24 per cent less in New York (£53) than in London (£70).

Post Office Travel Money also looked at the costs involved in a two-night trip to 10 European Christmas market destinations. 

Festive spirit: How prices compare for a festive break in 10 Christmas market towns in Europe

1. Budapest, Hungary: 28 November-31 December, Vörösmarty Square

2. Riga, Latvia: 29 November-9 January, Dome Square

3. Lille, France: 19 November-30 December, Place Rihour

4. Brussels, Belgium: 28 November-4 January, Grand Place

5. Prague, Czech Republic: 29 November-1 January, Old Town Square

6. Vienna, Austria: 15 November-24 December, City Hall

7. Copenhagen, Denmark: 15 November-4 January, Tivoli Gardens

8. Tallinn, Estonia: 22 November-8 January, Town Hall Square

9. Berlin, Germany: 24 November-31 December, Gendarmenmarkt

10. Stockholm, Sweden: 22 November–23 December, Old Town

Costs included in-resort expenditure such as meals and drinks. Prague proved the least expensive, with the total costs coming to £531.

The most expensive of the 10 destinations surveyed was Brussels with costs of £810.

Other market towns analysed include: Budapest, Riga, LIlle, Brussels, Prague, Vienna, Copenhagen, Tallinn, Berlin, Stockholm.

Andrew Brown, of Post Office Travel Money, said: 'There are great savings to be made in New York provided that shoppers have done their homework in advance and don’t assume that everything will be cheaper. 

'Although most items are cheaper, the savings vary and we did find examples of popular Christmas gifts that were more expensive in New York - so it will pay to check carefully before splashing the cash to avoid costly mistakes. 

'Sterling has risen quite significantly in value against European currencies this year, which means that city break holidaymakers will have more cash to spend. 

'However, it is still important for them to check prices and factor in all the costs they will incur on a Christmas Markets trip. 

'Holiday homework will show that short breaks to eastern European cities like Prague and Riga are hard to beat for value.'
