A lawyer has been jailed for two years after transferring more than $1million from a dead family friend's bank account to his own.

Igor Purlantov, 35, of New York, regularly forged the signature of Mohamad Ibraham Darwish Haj Ali, who died in October 2004, a court heard.

He accessed his friend’s HSBC Swiss bank account which held $3,395,000 and has now agreed to pay back $1,176,000 to Ali’s friends and relatives.

He will also pay back taxes to the IRS of $293,000 - after pleading guilty to tax evasion because he failed to pay any tax on the money.

Purlantov forged Ali’s name on a letter telling the Swiss bank to add Purlantov as a joint account holder, reported El Cerrito Patch.

Purlantov spent the next 17 months moving $1.17million to his own bank accounts in London and New York, the court heard.

Ali lived in El Cerrito in California and Purlantov was sentenced in nearby Oakland after pleading guilty to wire fraud and tax evasion.

Prosecutors say the scheme took place from October 2004 to February 2005 and Purlantov will begin his sentence in late January.

He forged documents before and after Ali’s death and was sentenced by District Court Judge Saundra Armstrong, reported the Contra Costa Times.

The conviction comes after Purlantov was charged in June 2011 following a joint two-year investigation by the IRS and FBI.

‘Purlantov accepted full responsibility and agreed to fully reimburse the beneficiaries of his deceased friend,’ the U.S. Department of Justice said.
