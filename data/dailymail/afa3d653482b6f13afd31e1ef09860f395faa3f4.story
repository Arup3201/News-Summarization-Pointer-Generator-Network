The vanishing foam being used to make sure defensive walls retreat a full ten yards at the World Cup will come in handy over the next few days.

No-one in this country of 200m football obsessives will ever want to see this Brazil team ever again after they lost this World Cup semi-final 7-1.

They should be scrubbed out, wiped from the history of the game after they were picked off by Joachim Low’s rampant Germany team.

Easy: Thomas Muller's opening goal came when he was unmarked at a corner

Distraught: Brazil fans at the stadium in Belo Horizonte stand in disbelief

What a 
vanishing act this was, with Julio Cesar, Maicon, captain David Luiz, 
Dante and Marcelo turning in one for the worst performances at the 
highest level in living memory.

Where
 was Luiz when Toni Kroos floated over a corner for Thomas Muller to 
stab in the first? Luiz looked like he was in a spin drier.

And
 where was Dante, where was Marcelo or Maicon as Germany put on the full
 programme during this extraordinary performance?  The answer is 
absolutely nowhere. 

Dante,
 mild-mannered and elegant when he pulls on the shirt of Bayern Munich, 
looked like a man who hadn’t played since a 4-0 win over Panama on June 
3. 

In
 fact he gave the impression of a man who had never played the 
game at all when Miroslav Klose, Kroos and Sami Khedira added to 
the scoreline.

Emotional: David Luiz unable to hold back the tears following full time

No hiding place: Marcelo reacting after full time

VIDEO Disbelief in Belo Horizonte after devastating Germany win

In
 many ways, what with the shrine to Neymar Junior - ForzaNeymar 10 
baseball caps in his honour, a shirt held up by David Luiz with his name
 on - they really asked for this. Behave yourself, Brazil.

They
 were lost in the moment, failing to pay attention to the job in hand 
and that was to reach the final against Holland or Argentina.

‘Seven
 steps to heaven’ Scolari had called it. Well they got to the sixth and 
only hell will await them after this semi-final shambles.

The
 target was to win the World Cup and a embroider a sixth gold star on 
that beautiful yellow jersey. There are some dark days ahead indeed for
 Brazil now.

Big Phil Scolari - Felipao - will pay the price. He will be sacked by the CBF for this shameful semi-final exit.

Scolari,
 a World Cup winner himself with the 2002 vintage, cannot escape the 
blame for this disastrous performance. He is finished.

On
 the eve of the game he had lightened the mood by revealing that Luiz, 
one of the team jokers, often mimics the coach during team meetings.

Embrace: Miroslav Klose, who grabbed the second for Germany, consoling Luis Gustavo

Brace: Toni Kroos scored the third and fourth on the night

High five: Sami Khedira puts Germany 5-0 up before half an hour

Abject: Brazil's defending was non-existent all night

First to every ball: Brazil's team were off the pace all night

It is fair to say that no-one wants to be in Scolari’s shoes now.

He
 should be wondering what on god’s earth he was doing when he presented 
Joachim Low with a CBF ‘goodie bag’ before the national anthems were 
played. Low looked at him with utter bemusement. 

It
 was toe-curling to watch them concede five times inside 29 mental 
minutes at the Estadio Mineairo and yet this could have all been 
avoided.

Had
 that back four, players who have Champions League pedigree with Real 
Madrid, Bayern Munich, Chelsea and Inter Milan, remained at their 
stations and stayed in position the score would have been 0-0 at 
half-time.

Instead
 they hared around the stadium, losing their minds and this game even 
before Thomas Muller struck Germany’s opening goal in the 11th minute.

Finisher: Andre Schurle, who scored Germany's final two, consoles his Chelsea team-mate Oscar

Contrast: Scolari with triumphant Germany coach Joachim Low

Those
 boys have enough experience to know that the race isn’t won in the 
opening laps and yet they lost their discipline, shape and, with it, the
 game. It was embarrassing and pitiful. 

Luiz’s
 performance brought back Gary Neville’s ‘PlayStation footballer’ 
analogy, the comment that made the former Chelsea defender mad.  Well 
Neville got it right because the stand-in captain was all over the shop.

There
 is the mild temptation to argue that playing on the right side of 
Brazil’ s defence, instead of his preferred left, because of Thiago 
Silva’s suspension was somehow to blame.

This
 was a performance of shock and awe by Germany, a ruthless exhibition of
 flair and fantasy as they chase their first World Cup win since 1990.

They will take some stopping now, that much is clear.

To be 5-0 up inside 29 minutes of a World Cup semi-final in the host’s backyard is really something quite radical.

After this, Brazil just lost a lot of respect.
