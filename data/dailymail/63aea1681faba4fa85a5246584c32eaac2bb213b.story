Martin Murray has arrived in Monte Carlo as he prepares for his world title shot against the fearsome Gennady Golovkin on Saturday.

And the St Helens middleweight writes exclusively for Sportsmail as he counts down the days to his third challenge for top honours.

I had a great camp in South Africa; it was a great trip and we were really well looked after.

As time went on, things got better and better and we left in a good place. It was definitely the right thing to do even though it's been hard being away from the family.

The first couple of weeks were difficult with the altitude but towards the end everything was flowing and I was feeling good as my body adapted to it.

Every fighter says they've had a great camp but I'm not one to lie. It's been a good camp, no two ways about it. There have been a couple of things that haven't gone well, as there is with every camp, but we've managed to get over them and make it work.

I've never worked at altitude as I did so if the science behind it is right, I'll be the fittest I've ever been. I'm also more experienced than I've ever been, it's my third world title fight, and I'm confident. I know how hard it's going to be but I'm really looking forward to it.

We went on safari on the last weekend but that was the only tourist thing we did. Everything else was just training, training, training.

I'm not good to be around on fight week. I'm in a hotel room on my own, the rest of the lads are in a different hotel and I don't see them much, I keep myself to myself. I'm getting a bit agitated, the fight's getting closer and I just want to fight. That will change when I weigh in and get some food; I'll be happy again.

Golovkin is in the hotel next to mine but there's no chance I'll see him because I don't go out. I won't see him apart from at the press conference and the weigh-in.

I just see the fight as a big job and if I want me and my family to have the lifestyle I want us to have, I have to beat him. 

Matthew Macklin said the way to beat Golovkin is to take the fight to him but it's easy to say that. It depends what kind of fighter you are.

Macklin might be saying that because it's maybe something he wishes he'd done. 

I'm going to work on the tactics we've come up with. People change when they get hit so I've not just got one game plan, I've got 10, 11, 12...

I just want to fight, it doesn't bother me who it is. I was in the lift with my manager and I said I wished he was Golovkin!

It might be daunting for some people, but I can't wait.
