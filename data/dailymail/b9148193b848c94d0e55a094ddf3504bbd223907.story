It could have ruined their relationship but after Bobby Noris confessed to Lydia Bright how he felt about Charlie, he decided last night to come clean and tell the man himself.

Watching his best friend dance with various women at his birthday party became all too much for the Charlie and he decided to come clean.

After storming out of Essex club Funky Mojoes, Bobby sat on a step as Charlie asked him what was wrong.

'I love you': Bobby Noris tells Charlie how he really feels about him at his birthday party

Reassuring him: Charlie told the camp salon owner that their friendship would never change

'Not really babe,' he replied. 'I think I haven't been entirely honest about things over the last few days.

'The time has kind of come. If I could flick a switch and not feel this I so would,' he went on to add.

'I guess what I'm trying to say is that I think I've kind of fallen quite hard for you and I do love you Charlie.'

Charlie - who used to date Gemma Collins - genuinely looked a little bit surprised following his confession, but reassured him that nothing would change between them.

Flick of a switch: Bobby said that if he could turn his feelings off he would

'It's a bit of a surprise if I'm honest,' he said. 'Nothing will jeopardise our friendship but I'm on a journey now and this is all about me growing. You've gotta let me do that because its what I want to do.'

'I didn't ever plan or expect to tell you this and if you have to break away for a little bit, I understand,' Bobby went on to say.

'I'm sorry if I've brought shame and embarrassment on you. I feel like I've betrayed you.'

But Charlie continued to reassure his good friend by saying: 'If there was an inkling of me that was interested in you in that way, I'd go for it but it is the way it is.

Taking it all in: Charlie said he was surprised at what Bobby had told him

Conflicted: Bobby told Lydia Bright earlier on that he wouldn't confess all to Bobby at his birthday party

'Our friendship means more than anything else. I hate seeing you this sad, I am here for you,' he added before letting Bobby have some time on his own, where he proceeded to burst into tears.

Meanwhile, inside the club there was more drama and confessions taking place after Cara Kilbey told Ricky Rayment that he needed to talk to Tom Pearce.

The rumours began after Lauren Goodger told Cara and Frankie Essex that Ricky's girlfriend Jessica Wright had been texting Tom Pearce flirty messages.

According to Lauren, Jessica messaged Tom saying: 'LG and TP k-i-s-s-i-n-g, I can't believe you cheated on me.'

Stirring things up: Lauren Goodger told Cara Kilbey and Frankie Essex over breakfast that Jessica Wright had been texting Tom Pearce

Cara clearly wasn't going to keep this information to herself and decided to approach Ricky at the bar where she said: 'I think it's not really my place to be saying things to you but there's an issue I think you should talk to Tom P about.'

Ricky's sudden mood change later prompted Jessica to confront Tom, who was sitting with Lauren, where she accused him of trying to split her and Ricky up.

Ricky then approached the trio where he asked to speak with Jessica alone.

When Jessica told her boyfriend about her messaging Tom, he asked her: 'That is the only message that is flirty on there?' to which she replied yes and confessed that she had confided in Tom about her trust issues.

Having a laugh: Jessica decided to confront Tom and accused him of trying to split her and Ricky up

Arguing: Jessica and Ricky ended up bickering about their trust issues

'I would never talk to a girl about it,' Ricky replied, 'You questioned me about trust when you went and did this.'

Elsewhere in the nightclub, Jamie - who works there - was causing a bit of a storm due to his brief fling with Lydia Bright following the collapse of her relationship with James 'Arg' Argent.

After Jamie approached Arg, Gemma Collins, Joey Essex and Diags to say hello, Arg became annoyed and said that he wanted to leave.

As Gemma tried to stick up for him,, he became even more angry telling Gemma to 'shut up' and asking her to stop comparing him to Jamie.

Awkward moment: Arg looked annoyed when Jamie came over to say hello, because he had a brief fling with Lydia after they split up

'Shut up': Arg was really rude to Gemma after she tried to stick up for him and make him feel better
