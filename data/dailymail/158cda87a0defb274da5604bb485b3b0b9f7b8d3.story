Her latest modelling gig certainly isn't her only one; she's also back fronting a line of bras for women with bigger breasts.

The 30F-cup star is the face of Tutti Rouge for SS15 and AW15. 

Ashley's modelling career was launched at the age of 17 after being scouted in a restaurant in Newcastle. She gave up modelling at 19 to focus on her studies, but took it up again at the age of 24.

The fledgling DJ is also a presenter on a series called Style Stars, which sees Ashley setting teenage girls a series of fashion challenges.

Ashley is also the showbiz presenter for Claire’s Accessories and has her own luxury postcode bangle company, Whistle & Bango, that she established with two friends in July 2013.
