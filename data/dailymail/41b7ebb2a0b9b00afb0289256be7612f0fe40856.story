Children who were aggressive or cruel had reduced brain activity in response to images of others in pain

Brain scans can be used to identify children who may be potential psychopaths, new research has shown.

Scientists have found that certain areas of a psychopath's  brain showed a reduced activity in response to images of
others in pain.

The regions affected are those known to play a role in
empathy, the ability to relate to other people's feelings.

Scientists say the patterns could act as a marker to single
out children at a risk of becoming adult psychopaths.

A total of 55 boys aged 10 to 16 were assessed in the study.

Of these, 37 met the criteria for children with 'conduct problems' (CP) according to questionnaire answers provided
by parents and teachers.

CP children display a plethora of antisocial traits
including aggression and dishonesty.

Like the central character in Lionel Shriver's novel We Need
to Talk About Kevin, they can be callous and cruel.

Youngsters with conduct problems are not likely to follow in
Kevin's footsteps and commit a school massacre, but the research findings
suggest at least some could grow up to be psychopaths.

'Our findings indicate that children with conduct
problems have an atypical brain response to seeing other people in pain,'
psychologist Professor Essi Viding from University College London said.

'It is important to view these findings as an indicator
of early vulnerability, rather than biological destiny.

'We know that children can be very responsive to
interventions, and the challenge is to make those interventions even better, so
that we can really help the children, their families, and their wider social
environment.'

About five per cent of children qualify for a diagnosis of CP, but
little is known about the condition's underlying cause.

Participants in the study underwent functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) scans while being shown images of other people's hands
and feet in painful and non-painful situations.

Some psychopaths display disturbing symptoms from a young age, such the main protagonist in Lionel Shriver's book We Need to Talk about Kevin.

A distinct difference was seen in the brain responses of
children with and without CP.

In children with conduct problems, brain activity in three
key regions was reduced when looking at the pictures. They were the bilateral anterior insula, the anterior
cingulate cortex, and the inferior frontal gyrus.

All are regions associated in previous studies with feelings
of empathy for others in pain.

The scientists wrote in the journal Current Biology: 'We show that callous traits in particular may underlie atypical neural
responses to others' pain in CP, which may represent an early neurobiological
marker for later psychopathy.

'It remains an empirical question whether empathic
responding can be normalised in children with CP.'

Not all children with conduct problems displayed a
vulnerability to psychopathy, the researchers stressed.

'This raises the possibility of tailoring existing
interventions to suit the specific profile of atypical processing that
characterises a child with conduct problems,' Prof Viding said.
