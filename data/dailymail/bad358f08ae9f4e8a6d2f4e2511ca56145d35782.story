Stunning images created using naturally occurring scientific phenomena such as how wind travels around Earth and how bacteria cells 'glide' are among the entrants to this year's Art of Science competition at Princeton University.

Over 170 photos - all taken during scientific research - were entered into this year's competition before judges whittled them down to the best 44 images, which are currently being displayed in a gallery on the university's campus.

Students, staff and family members were then given the opportunity to vote for their favourites, and the winning entries have been made available online.

The winning entry called East-West, West-East, was taken by Martin Jucker studying the
Program in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences. According to Jucker, the winds around Earth are directed from west to east, or east to west. Jucker's image shows the direction of the wind around Earth, averaged over time. The blue area shows wind travelling in east-to-west direction, the red areas show wind travelling west-to-east

Second place was awarded to 16-year-old Michael Kosk. His photo is an enhanced image of a crushed piece of birch wood. Kosk explained: 'The dense cellular structure of wood is what protects it, in part, from microbes breaking apart cellulose and causing rot. In my materials science course we broke apart the cellular structure of birch by resorting to mechanical strength, crushing it along a specific direction and buckling the cellulose pathways that would normally be responsible for the distribution of water and nutrients to the rest of the tree'

Pablo Debenedetti, Dean for Research at Princeton said: 'Like art, science and engineering are deeply creative activities.

'Also like art, science and engineering at their very best are highly unpredictable in their outcomes.

'The Art of Science exhibit celebrates the beauty of unpredictability and the unpredictability of beauty.'

The winning image was taken by Martin Jucker from the Program in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences.

His image depicted the flow of the constant winds around Earth, averaged over time and he won Â£164 ($250).

Second place went to 16-year-old Michael Kosk from Woodrow Wilson School.

He took a black-and-white photo of a crushed piece of birch wood for his entry and won Â£101 ($154.51).

This entry into Princeton University's Art of Science contest is called Bridging the Gap and was taken by Jason Wexler and Howard A. Stone of the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. When drops of liquid are trapped in a thin gap between two solids, a strong negative pressure develops inside the drops. If the solids are flexible this pressure deforms the solids to close the gap. In Wexler and Stone's experiment the solids were transparent, which allowed the pair to take photos of the drops from above. Alternating dark and light lines represent lines of constant gap height. These lines are caused by light interference, which also causes rainbows or patterns in an oil slick

Bands of social bacterium Myxococcus xanthus travel together. In order to hunt prey efficiently and protect one another, these cells coordinate the way in which they move - or 'glide'. In this image the gliding of hundreds of thousands of these cells was tracked over four hours. Their paths transition from blue to red according to the amount of time it took, with blue as the start time and red as the end time.This photo called The History of Gliding was taken by Mingzhai Sun and Joshua Shaevitz from the Department of Physics and the Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics

Paul Csogi and Chris Cane of the Lewis Center for the Arts and the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory came third for their 'web of art and science' image.

Their image was designed to show the similarities and differences of a website devoted to science, compared to one devoted to art and the pair won Â£62 ($95.49).

The gallery of images at the Friend Center on the Princeton University campus was opened on 10 May.

All 139 attendees of the opening reception were given the chance to also choose the People's Choice winners.

The favourites included an image of the nurse cells in a fruit fly ovary, light interference that looks like zebra print and photo called Medusa that shows a mass of C. elegans worms.

Other entries that were handpicked but didn't win a prize include a goby fish peering from the centre of a coral, taken by Chhaya Werner of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.

The full list of entries is available on the Art of Science website.

Ohad Fried from the Department of Computer Science took this image called Exposed. It shows a reconstruction of a face from a blurred video. Using a video containing a blurred, unrecognisable face, the data from individual video frames was combined to create a good approximation of what the original face looked like

Messenger meshwork  by
Shawn C. Little, Kristina S. Sinsimer, Elizabeth R. Gavis, and Eric F. Wieschaus from the
Department of Molecular Biology. Their image shows four nurse cells in a fruit fly ovary. Each red or green dot is an individual RNA molecule, which is produced from DNA - shown in blue. The RNA molecules link together and move from one nurse cell to another, and then into the developing egg

The winning entry, by Martin Jucker, depicted the flow of wind as it moves around Earth - either from east to west or west-to-east
