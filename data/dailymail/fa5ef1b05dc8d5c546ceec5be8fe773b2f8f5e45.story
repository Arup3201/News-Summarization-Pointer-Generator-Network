George Osborne refused to commit to spending 2 per cent of UK national income on defence

George Osborne infuriated Tory MPs yesterday after he refused to commit to spending 2 per cent of Britain’s national income on defence – despite a steep rise in the foreign aid budget.

The Chancellor dodged the question repeatedly during a post-Budget interview, even though there is growing pressure from politicians and military chiefs.

Mr Osborne refused four times to guarantee that he would meet the 2 per cent target in the next Parliament, saying only: ‘We are promising to keep our country safe.’

Last night Tory MPs, who have been campaigning to have the commitment enshrined in the Tory party manifesto, were enraged by the Chancellor’s response given escalating tensions with Russia and the rise of Islamic State.

They are particularly angry given that the Government has committed itself to spending at least 0.7 per cent of GDP – currently around £12billion a year – on foreign aid.

Tory MP Sir Gerald Howarth, a former defence minister, said: ‘Defence of the realm is the first duty of government and in these very dangerous times it seems to be inexplicable that the Tory party is unable to commit to maintaining the defence budget at 2 per cent in accordance with the Nato commitment.

‘It doesn’t make sense, especially when we are just one miscalculation away from a possible European war.’

Tory MP Peter Bone echoed added: ‘Two per cent should be a commitment in the Conservative Party manifesto. It is a Nato target and we are now putting 0.7 per cent of national income into overseas aid. If you can do it for overseas aid then you can definitely do it for defence.’

The Institute for Fiscal Studies warned that it would be impossible to meet such demands to protect defence spending without imposing huge cuts on other areas of spending such as policing, transport and energy – especially with health, schools and foreign aid already protected.

Economist Soumaya Keynes said that unprotected departments are already facing real terms budget cuts averaging 9.4 per cent by 2020.

Protecting defence spending at 2 per cent would mean that other departments would have to be slashed by 16.4 per cent.

Yesterday Mr Osborne told Radio 4’s Today programme that the Tory party was ‘not proposing deeper cuts’ to defence spending. But he failed to say whether the party would commit to the Nato target of 2 per cent.

He said: ‘We are helping in Eastern Europe, training Ukrainian forces, our fighters are protecting the Baltic states, our military is doing a brilliant job in Sierra Leone, we are playing a global role.’

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls waded into the row yesterday, saying: ‘His (George Osborne’s) desire to get to an overall surplus by 2019/20 means even bigger cuts in the next three years to our police, our defence forces than we’ve seen in the last few years.’

David Cameron will give £20million to help former Communist countries fend off Russian aggression.

The fund, drawn from the foreign aid budget, is based on a scheme set up by Margaret Thatcher to help Poland and Hungary move towards democracy after the fall of the Berlin Wall.

Serbia, Moldova, Bosnia, Georgia and Ukraine all face Kremlin intimidation.

Defence chiefs will pay £250million over the next few years to private contractors – so they can advise on how to reduce the ‘over-reliance’ on other contractors, it has emerged. The findings will be published in a report today which warns Britain’s military capabilities are at ‘real risk’ from multi-billion-pound cost overruns.
