A crazed father stabbed his wife during a fight at their family home before shooting two of his children - killing one - and turning the gun on himself.

Jeremy Gehl, 37, stabbed his estranged wife Melissa Randolph, 33, with a knife during a confrontation on Tuesday night in Paoli, Indiana.

When his six-year-old son and three-year-old daughter heard the disturbance and came downstairs, he shot them, killing his daughter and seriously injuring his son.

Police say he then fatally shot himself with the gun.

Gehl and Randolph had a third child, a boy, in the home, who was not hurt.

Friends and family on social media named the little girl as Addison and paid tribute to a 'beautiful baby girl.'

Local news station WLKY reported that police arrived to find Randolph, who had managed to run outside, but was bleeding heavily. Police said she had the unharmed child in her arms.

Gehl was pronounced dead by the Orange County Coroner's Office.
