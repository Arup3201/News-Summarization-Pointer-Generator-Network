It was a marriage of money and power last night at The Spectator magazine's summer party.

David Cameron, George Osborne and Pippa Middleton turned out to celebrate the weekly Conservative magazine, which focuses on political and current events.

Held at their office in Old Queen Street, Westminster, some of politics' most influential faces mingled over champagne, and as the magazine's latest contributor Pippa made sure she worked the circuit.

All white: Pippa writes a weekly diary column for the Conservative magazine, where she describes her weekly plans and musings

Dressed in a pretty white crochet summer dress, Pippa was seen sharing a few jokes with Spectator editor Fraser Nelson.

Her boyfriend Nico Jackson was also in attendance at the high-profile bash but took a back seat as Pippa worked the room.

Mingling: Dressed in a summery white dress, Pippa mingled with some of the country's most powerful politicians

By her side: Pippa's boyfriend Nico Jackson attended the high-profile event with her

She mingled with some of politics's most powerful people such as Philip Hammond, Secretary of State for Defence, Damian Green, Minister of State for 
Policing and Criminal Justice and David Willetts, Minister of State for Universities and Science.

The magazine, which is currently owned by David and Frederick Barclay, who also own The Daily Telegraph, is well known for supporting the Conservative party.

Editorship of The Spectator has often been cited as a step on the ladder to a high position in the Conservative Party.

Big names: The party, which was held at the magazine's office in Old Queen Street, Westminster, London, saw the likes of David Cameron and George Osborne in attendance

Men in power: (L-R) Grant Shapps, MP the Conservative Party chairman, Andrew Neil, David Cameron and Spectator editor Fraser Nelson caught up over some drinks

High-profile guests: Lord Michael Howard, Dorrit Moussaieff and Sir Martin Sorrell also attended the bash

Having fun: George Osborne and Pippa seemed to be enjoying themselves at the party to celebrate the weekly conservative magazine, which focuses on political and current events

And with past editors such as Iain Macleod, Ian Gilmour and Nigel Lawson all going on to become cabinet members, it really does seem to be the case.

Boris Johnson, who was editor between 1999 and 2005, also seemingly used his position at the magazine as a springboard for a greater role in public affairs.

So it comes as no surprise that the Tory's were out in force.

Boris Johnson's sister Rachel was in attendance, along with  Owen Patterson, Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Adam Afriyie, and Alan Duncan, Minister of
State for International Development.

Mingling: Francis Maude, Minister for the Cabinet Office chatted to Paymaster General and Labour MP Ben Bradshaw

Dapper: Zafar Rushdie and Natalie Coyle were dressed impeccably for the event

Fellow writers: Rachel Johnson caught up with journalist, historian, speechwriter and author, Paul Johnson

Francis Maude, Minister for the Cabinet Office also put in an appearance, as did Lord Michael Howard, Dorrit Moussaieff and Sir Martin Sorrell.

The Spectator, an intellectual weekly 
magazine first published in 1828, might not come to mind as the natural 
platform for the thoughts of Kate Middleton's little sister, who is widely celebrated 
as a ‘rear of the year’ contender.

But her weekly tongue-in-cheek 'diary' for the magazine has been met by criticism in intellectual circles.

Arrival: Andrew Neil and Susan Neilsson as well as Mrs David Willetts and Mrs Owen Patterson were at the event

Suited and booted: Owen Patterson, Secretary of State for Energy and  Climate Change and Alan Duncan, Minister of State for International Development joined the party

Enjoying themselves: Philip Hammond, Secretary of State for Defence and Adam Afriyie MP seemed to be enjoying the summer event

The column records her daily activities and musings such as a fly-fishing trip in Berwickshire, her plans to enter a running, cycling and kayaking triathlon in New 
Zealand and even that she apparently has a soft spot for Roger Federer, ‘a
man who exudes so much grace and beauty that he inspires anybody with a
pulse,’ as she puts it.

Those close to Pippa insisted the Spectator articles are all her 
own work, and that she deliberately intended to send herself up.

‘It is completely intentional and good humoured,’ a source told the Daily Mail.

Musings: Pippa Middleton's blogs also appear on The Spectator website and they are very tongue-in-cheek
