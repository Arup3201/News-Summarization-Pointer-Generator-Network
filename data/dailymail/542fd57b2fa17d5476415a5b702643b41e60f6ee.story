When British mom Jennifer Devitt discovered she was pregnant with her second child in quick succession, she decided to take a preventative strike on her mummy tummy.

‘I’m a size eight (U.S. size four) and have always had a flat stomach, but when I had my first daughter I found it really difficult to get it back,’ says  Jennifer, 29, a beauty therapist and mother to Indie-May, 20 months, and Holly, four months.

‘My muscles were non-existent, everything stuck out and it was six months before I could wear a T-shirt because of my jelly belly. I felt really self-conscious and didn’t even like looking in the mirror.

The big squeeze: Mother-of-two Anna Blakey wore a compression girdle after her two pregnancies

‘I knew that with your second baby 
everything can really go haywire because your muscles are already 
weakened, so I started looking for something to help.’

To most women, that might be a gym membership, a sharp swerve away from the cookie aisle or a brisk walk with the stroller each day. But, like a growing number of mothers, Jennifer wanted results more quickly than that.

The Belly Bandit promised to be a solution to her problem. The huge band of thick, strong elastic, that retails for anything between $50 and $80, is worn around the midriff after pregnancy and promises to shrink the belly, waist and hips. 

It is also said to remind women to tighten their core muscles, to reduce swelling and stretch marks, and support the spine. Similar compression garments are called The Cinch, the Squeem and the Gowri wrap. 

The trend has been growing for a number of years, despite warnings that it can be damaging to women’s health.

Jennifer strapped herself into the Belly Bandit just three days after giving birth.

'I wore it day and night - I was pretty determined. And it was so expensive that I wanted to get my money’s worth'

'I wore it day and night — I was pretty determined. And it was so expensive that I wanted to get my money’s worth,’ she says. ‘I found it comfortable and even slept in it. My partner, Wesley, didn’t mind it.  He knew I wanted to feel good in my clothes.’

Jennifer says she was ‘gobsmacked’ by the results.

‘Within two weeks I was a (U.S.) size six and could wear a tight T-shirt. I really noticed the difference in my abdominal and pelvic-floor floor muscles, even though I wasn’t doing any exercise.

‘It took me six weeks to get back to a size four and a weight of 112lbs. I never thought it would be so dramatic.’

Belly-binding is rooted in ancient 
tradition. In Japan, the Middle East and South America, it is normal for
 women to wear a compressing wrap, corset or girdle to speed up their 
return to their pre-pregnancy size.

Its
 revival in the West has been fuelled by celebrity endorsements: actress
 Jessica Alba credited her enviably tiny and toned post-baby body to 
wearing two corsets, one on top of the other, day and night, for three 
months.

Kourtney Kardashian and Minnie Driver sang the praises of the Belly Bandit while Angelina Jolie and Gwen Stefani wore The Cinch, a $90 wrap available in upmarket maternity shops. 

While there’s no doubt shapewear can make lumps and bumps appear to vanish, some experts warn against squeezing your post- pregnancy body back into shape.

Some obstetricians say women are risking stress incontinence, digestion problems and weakened back muscles.

Nicky Croft, a women’s health physiotherapist at the APPI Clinic in London, says: 'After giving birth, the uterus is still enlarged and the whole of the abdominal wall has lengthened and stretched throughout the pregnancy. 

'This will return to normal, but it 
takes time. The evidence shows that the best way to reduce abdominal 
distension is breast-feeding and specific exercises to strengthen the 
abdominals during and after pregnancy.

'A
 belly-binder won’t help you lose baby fat — the only things to affect 
that are your metabolism and diet. If you bind the abdominal wall too 
tightly, you’re putting your pelvic floor under pressure, which could 
lead to urinary leakage. The pelvic floor has just been through a big 
stretch, so the last thing it wants is to be pressured.’

The other concern is that belly binders take over the job of the stomach muscles, meaning deeper, core muscles become lazy.

‘If
 you give too much external support to the stomach, the abdominal and 
pelvic-floor muscles will be deterred from working as well,’ says Croft.

‘So,
 in the long term you might become reliant on wearing the wrap to keep 
yourself supported, rather than retraining your core muscles to do it.’

Kathryn Lister tried two belly binders following the birth of her daughter Daisy.

‘As I’m 41, I was aware my body could go south after I had a baby,’  says Kathryn, who works in finance and is married to Simon, 45.

‘The rest of me is fairly flabby, but my stomach has always been flat. So I really wanted to try to hold on to it. I was reading online mothers’ forums and saw all these mentions of belly binding.

‘I remember reading about Jessica Alba doing it and that really stuck in my mind. I ended up buying The Cinch and some Squeem shapewear.’

Two days after her daughter was born, Kathryn strapped herself into The Cinch, but struggled to get used to it.

‘Daisy was born on one of the hottest days of the year, so it was uncomfortable. It was also very obvious. If I was wearing anything other than a thick shirt or jumper you could see it under my clothes.

‘It’s recommended to wear it for 18 hours a day, which seemed like madness.

‘In the end, I had to take it off every time I wanted to feed Daisy because I simply wasn’t comfortable sitting in it.’

After two weeks, Kathryn decided to try the Squeem, a girdle that runs from under the bra to the bikini line.

‘This was even worse. It had hook and eye fastenings, so it took ages to put on and bits of you spill out. The fat has got to go somewhere, hasn’t it? I looked like an overstuffed sausage.’

Yet the internet is awash with 
‘miracle’ stories about women racing to get back into their 
pre-pregnancy clothes. Mother-of-two Anna Blakey wore a compression 
girdle after her two pregnancies.

‘I’m a small build, so I didn’t put on much weight, but my muscles were weak and I was looking for something to support my back,’ says Anna, 40, a graphic designer who lives with her husband Dominic, 45, a sales director, and their children in South London.

‘I loved the feeling of support and confidence it gave me and people were amazed when I was back in my (U.S.) size-six jeans within two weeks of giving birth.’

When Anna had her son, now three, she had to have an emergency Caesarean. Without discussing it with her midwife, she used a girdle designed for  post C-section bellies, with side-fastening eyehooks.

‘It sat smoothly over the scar and made all my clothes more comfortable. I think it also helped the scar to heal, in the same way that if you cut your finger you put pressure on it,’ she says.Anna still occasionally wears her compression garment. ‘I will put it on if I want to wear a certain dress. It helps cinch in my waist and tum.’

However, despite such reports, the 
belly-binding trend worries midwives, who feel women are under too much 
pressure to snap back into shape after pregnancy.

Janet
 Fyle, who leads the Royal College Of Midwives’ policy on obesity and 
maternal public health issues, says: ‘It is far better to lose your 
pregnancy weight gradually, by eating healthily and taking gentle 
exercise, such as swimming, with your baby.

‘Women
 who are pregnant or who have just given birth should be celebrated, not
 hidden away. We’re at risk of making women feel guilty about their 
bodies.’

Kathryn, who 
had suffered an abdominal split — where the muscles do not reconnect 
properly after birth — ditched the two different belly binders and saw a
 physiotherapist.

‘She gave me some Pilates and pelvic-floor exercises, which are helping. I just don’t think there’s a quick fix,’ she says.

And like many new mothers, Kathryn found that the arrival of her little girl signalled a change in her priorities.

‘I haven’t worried about my stomach as much as I thought I would,’ she says.

‘Daisy
 is my focus. All I cared about was being able to feed her, to cuddle 
her and feel her skin on mine. Yes, my tummy is probably a bit squishy, 
but it’s all worth it for her.’
