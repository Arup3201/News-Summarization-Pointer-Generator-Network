He repaid his loyal wife by dumping her after she sacrificed her Olympic dreams to help his bid for glory.

Now windsurfer Nick Dempsey has rubbed salt in the wound.

Months after his split from sailor Sarah Ayton, 33, he is said to be dating the woman who replaced her in Team GB.

Dempsey, 32, who moved out of the 
family home weeks after winning a silver medal at London 2012, has been 
seen in restaurants and bars with 25-year-old Cardiff-born blonde Hannah
 Mills.

With her teammate Saskia Clark, she  
also won silver at London 2012 in the 470 class – the yachting event 
Miss Ayton had been due to compete in.

Miss Ayton was one of the ‘Three Blondes in a Boat’ who won gold at the Beijing Olympics in 2008.

She had also taken gold at Athens in 
2004 and would have had the chance in London to become the first British
 woman to win three consecutive Olympic golds.

But she abandoned her training a year 
before the games to focus on ‘supporting Nick’ – who was desperate to 
improve on the bronze he secured in Athens – and looking after the 
couple’s two young sons.

After he won silver, Dempsey paid tribute to his ‘amazing wife’ who had ‘sacrificed a medal’ so he could win his.

In November, Dempsey attended the 
British Olympic Ball at the Grosvenor House Hotel in Mayfair without his
 wife, but was  seen arriving with Miss Mills and Miss Clark.

A week later, the Daily Mail revealed 
that Dempsey had left the £425,000 home in Weymouth, Dorset, that he 
shared with Miss Ayton and their children. He moved into a £200,000 
two-bedroom flat a mile away which the couple bought as an investment 
property in 2007.

After winning his silver last August, 
Dempsey paid tribute to Miss Ayton, saying: ‘She basically let me go and
 fully concentrate on trying to win and she looked after everything else
 in life.

‘She has been absolutely amazing. I 
couldn’t have done it without her. There is no doubt in my mind she 
would have won here. She sacrificed a medal.’

The marriage split came after  Miss 
Ayton had publicly hinted  at a comeback for the 2016  Olympics in Rio, 
saying ‘there is  a bit of a desire burning again’.

But asked about the 
prospect of them both competing, Dempsey said: ‘There is potential for 
that, but there is also the potential for a lot of problems with that – 
we do have two kids, and to do that would require a lot of funding and a
 lot of sacrifices to be made.’

Asked if he was prepared to look after
 the children like his wife had done, he laughed: ‘I’m not sure I would.
 She is a better parent than me.

'She is far better at looking after the 
kids than I am. I don’t really fancy being a full-time dad.’  According 
to a friend, Dempsey became a regular on the party scene after his 
success at London 2012.

The source said: ‘After Nick won the silver 
medal, he was going out a lot. He was living the life of a bachelor.’

Miss Mills was a close friend  of 
Dempsey before his marriage broke up. She was once described by Miss 
Clark as ‘a bit of a social hand grenade’.

Both Dempsey and Miss Ayton refused to comment yesterday.
