A Virginia gay activist has been charged in federal court in the shooting of a security guard at the headquarters of a conservative Christian lobbying group.

Federal authorities say Floyd Lee Corkins II told a guard at the Family Research Council, 'I don't like your politics' before shooting him in the arm. The guard and others helped subdue Corkins, who was taken into custody.

He's been charged with assault with intent to kill and with bringing a firearm across state lines. Authorities found a box of ammunition and 15 Chick-fil-A sandwiches in his backpack.

Under arrest: Police say Floyd Corkins II, walked into the Family Research Council's headquarters in Washington, DC's Chinatown area with Chick-fil-A items and shot a guard

Local and federal investigators work to gather evidence after a security guard was shot in the arm at the headquarters of the Family Research Council August 15, 2012 in Washington, DC.

At
approximately 10.45 a.m. on Wednesday morning  28-year-old Floyd 
Corkins II, walked into the Family Research Council's (FRC) headquarters
in Washington, DC's Chinatown area, made a statement, produced a gun 
and then shot a security guard who tried to stop him.

Corkins had been volunteering at a community center dedicated to gay, lesbian and transgendered people.

The
guard was rushed to hospital while witnesses said that when the man was
disarmed, the suspect said, 'Don't shoot me, it was not about you, it 
was what this place stands for.'

David Mariner, the executive director of The DC Center for the LGBT Community, confirmed Corkins had been volunteering at the center for about the past 6 months.

Mariner described Corkins as 'kind, gentle and unassuming.'

While police have not yet stated what motivated Corkins, a coalition of 25 gay rights groups released a statement through GLAAD condemning the shooting.

'The motivation and circumstances behind today's tragedy are still unknown, but regardless of what emerges as the reason for this shooting, we utterly reject and condemn such violence.

'We wish for a swift and complete recovery for the victim of this terrible incident,' the statement read.'

The Family Research Council is a 
right-wing, conservative lobbying organisation that is against abortion,
euthanasia and same-sex marriages.

Speaking today after Corkin's was charged, the FRC President Tony Perkins spoke of his 'appreciation' of support from groups that might not necessarily agree with his groups viewpoint.

He called for a stop to the 'endless rhetoric' that he believed caused the Family Research Council shooting.

'The
police are investigating this incident,' said FRC President Tony 
Perkins in a statement yesterday. 'Our first concern is with our colleague who was
shot today. Our concern is for him and his family.'

The council was also recently in the news when Mr. Perkins defended Chick-fil-A chief executive Dan Cathy's public comments that were perceived as critical of gay marriage.

Cathy, the president of the 
multimillion-dollar empire said in an interview with the conservative 
paper Baptist Press last month that his company is ‘very much supportive
of the family,’ but only when it involves heterosexual couples.

'Well, guilty as charged,' Cathy 
responded when asked about Chick-fil-A’s backing of ‘traditional’ 
families with a husband and wife.

His comments sparked outrage among gay and lesbian groups across the country, with many holding protests and 'kiss-ins' at Chick-fil-A restaurants.

Perkins later spoke out in support of Cathy, saying: 'All 
Chick-fil-A did was refuse to be bullied by the politically correct 
crowd.'

The former president of the Family Research Council and former
Republican presidential candidate, Gary Bauer also said at the time: 'The values of the Family 
Research Council - pro-life and pro-family - are shared by millions of 
Americans of many backgrounds, and should not make anyone a target of 
violence.'

'He opened fire on the security guard,' said MPD Police Chief Cathy Lanier.

'The
security guard was struck, is right now receiving treatment and is in 
stable condition. The security guard and others wrestled the suspect 
down to the ground and he is in custody.'

It is thought that the security guard was shot in the arm and was conscious and breathing when he was taken to hospital.

'The security guard here is a hero, as far as I’m concerned,' said Chief Lanier.

'He did his job. The person never made it past the front.'

According to Fox News, the suspect 'made statements regarding their policies and then opened fire with a gun striking a security guard.'

As they began their investigation, federal authorities began treating the incident as a case of domestic terrorism.

'We don't know enough about him or 
his circumstances to determine what his connection is to this group, 
(The FRC) or his mental state, or what he was doing or thinking of 
doing,' said James McJunkin, the head of the FBI's Washington Field 
Office.

Authorities recovered Corkin's car at a Virginia Metro station and then traveled to speak to neighbours who knew his family.

'They were always so sweet and nice,' said Stephanie Meyer, who lives nearby to the Corkin's Virginia home.

'They are awesome people. We never had any issues.'

The White House said that President Obama was informed of the shooting while he was traveling in Iowa.

'The president expressed his concern for the individual injured in the shooting and his strong belief that this type of violence has no place in our society,' said spokesman Jay Carney.

Mitt Romney made a statement after hearing of the gunman entering the building.

'I am appalled by the shooting today at the offices of the Family Research Council in our nation’s capital,' he said.

'There
is no place for such violence in our society. My prayers go out to the 
wounded security guard and his family, as well as all the people at the 
Family Research Council whose sense of security has been shattered by 
today’s horrific events.'

'So we're going to try to sort this all out, pull the evidence together, do all the interviews we can.'
