As Andy Murray battled it out against Tomas Berdych during the semi-finals of the Australian Open today, it wasn't just the on-court action that was getting everyone's attention.

For on the sidelines, Andy's fiancee Kim Sears was facing a tennis WAG-off against Tomas' tanned model partner Ester Satorova for the second day running.

The two women came face-to-face for a tense stand-off as they supported their respective partners at the sporting event - shouting and cheering in support.

Whilst Kim wore a navy dress complete with a blazer, Ester opted for a more casual outfit wearing a floaty pink shirt.

Both women looked tense as the two tennis pros battled it out on the court and could be seen screaming and, at one point - in Kim's case - swearing as GB's Andy took on Czech player Tomas.

Much has been made of the rivalry between the two women, both of whom have recently got engaged to their tennis pros.  

And as they attended the event in Melbourne, particular attention was paid to the rings bestowed upon them by their partners.

Kim's £250K ring

Kim's ring:

Kim Sears’s ring (seen yesterday during Murray’s match) is said to be platinum featuring a brilliant-cut diamond of around 3.5 carats, surrounded by smaller stones. 

Diamonds in the shoulders of the ring take the weight up to around 4.7 carats.

Its estimated value for insurance purposes is £250,000.

Ester's £225K ring

Ester's ring:

Ester Satorova’s design (pictured yesterday) is thought to be handmade from platinum. 

It has a square-cut centre diamond of around four carats, set with a pair of baguette stones, taking the total to around 5.3 carats.

Its estimated value for insurance purposes is £225,000.

Whilst Berdych’s engagement ring is estimated to be worth around £225,000, Murray’s has been valued slightly higher at around £250,000. 

Murray proposed to Kim after nine years last year with a 3.5-carat platinum diamond ring, which he is said to have selected himself.

Kim did not look so happy with the proceedings as Andy struggled to score against Tomas 

Ester looked shocked as the action played out on the court - she and Tomas - who have been dating since 2012 announced their engagement last week 

Czech national Berdych, meanwhile, announced his engagement to model Ester Satorova last week and opted for a hand-made four carat square-shaped diamond on a platinum band.

Swimwear model Ester, who is also Czech, flashed her giant ring earlier in the week while watching world number seven Berdych’s quarterfinal win against Rafael Nadal in Melbourne.

Andy and Kim, both 27, met in 2005 when 17-year-old Kim was at a tennis championship with her father Nigel Sears, a coach.

Kim made sure to cheer her finance on as he battled it out in the semi-finals 

Murray, who has an estimated fortune of £3 million and earned £11.5million last year, is said to have wooed her with phone calls and flowers.

The couple, who live in a £5.6million home in Oxshott, Surrey, are planning their wedding for next autumn, according to Murray’s mother Judy.

Berdych, 29, and Miss Satorova’s relationship has been less lengthy, with the pair getting together in 2012 following his split with fellow tennis pro, Lucie Safarova.

The couple announced their engagement during a Channel Seven interview at the Botanical Gardens in Melbourne on Tuesday last week.

Following the interview, Miss Satorova, also from the Czech Republic, tweeted: ‘Our secret from last year Holiday is OUT.’
