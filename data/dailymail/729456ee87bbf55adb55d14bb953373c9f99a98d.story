A technician at a leading university used his laboratory equipment to prepare £10,000 worth of high-grade cocaine.

Timothy Newbury operated a hydraulic press in the physics department at Bristol University to create blocks of the Class A drug.

CCTV showed him sneaking into the laboratory with accomplice Nicholas Avery, a former soldier who had begun preparing the cocaine in a workshop at his home. Cocaine is first cut with other substances before being pressed into a block for sale.

The men were caught together when 
police stopped 53-year-old Newbury’s car and found £10,000 of pressed 
cocaine inside. He was suspended by the university after his arrest and 
has now been sacked.

Newbury was jailed for 18 months at 
Bristol Crown Court after admitting possession with intent to supply. 
The court heard he was due to receive a small amount of money for his 
part in the crime, but had not been paid anything.

The case has echoes of the popular US
drama Breaking Bad, in which chemistry teacher Walter White, played by 
Bryan Cranston, uses his scientific know-how to produce crystal meth, a 
powerful form of speed.

Sentencing Newbury, of Bristol, on 
Friday, Judge Julian Lambert told him: ‘You had led a positively good 
and productive life until now and you have let your friends and family 
down.’

When Avery’s home in Bristol was 
searched, officers discovered 1.6lbs of high-purity cocaine worth almost
£200,000, and almost £4,000 in cash.

Avery, 53, who served in Northern 
Ireland and the Falklands, admitted two counts of possessing cocaine 
with intent to supply and was jailed for five years. The judge told him:
‘You have given great service to your country and I am greatly 
disappointed in you.’

He told both men: ‘You made a 
terrible choice when you decided to involve yourselves in the world of 
controlled drugs.’ A proceeds-of-crime hearing will be held in 
September.

Avery worked as a lab technician at the physics department at the prestigious University of Bristol

'Kenneth Ball, prosecuting, said: 'Mr Newbury was a lab technician employed by the University of Bristol in the Physics department.

'CCTV showed Mr Newbury and Mr Avery going to that lab. There the hydraulic press was used to press the cocaine taken there by Mr Avery who had cut it.

'In effect the Crown says there was a
cutting workshop at Mr Avery’s home and a pressing workshop at the 
university which was operated by Mr Newbury.'

Tim
Rose, defending Newbury, said he had an impeccable background but once 
he had agreed to help Avery felt he could not then say no.

Tabitha Macfarlane, for Avery, said he had been a soldier of some stature who wanted to work as a close-protection security officer but needed money for the relevant licences.

She said he recognised the stress he had caused his family - especially his 88-year-old father who was a veteran of Monte Cassino - and whom he feared he would not see again.

A proceeds-of-crime hearing will be held in September.

A University of Bristol spokesman said: 'We suspended the individual concerned as soon as we were made aware of the incident.

'We ceased the individual’s employment following our own investigation.'
