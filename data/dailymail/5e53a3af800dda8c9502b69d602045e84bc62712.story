Home Secretary Theresa May moved yesterday to damp down calls for a return of the death  penalty after the murder of  Manchester policewomen Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone.

The callous killing of the two PCs, aged 23 and 32 respectively, led to demands for capital punishment, abolished in 1965, to be restored.

The calls were supported last week by Paul Beshenivsky,  widowed husband of PC Sharon Beshenivsky, who was shot dead  in Bradford in 2005.

Call for calm: Theresa May is against return of the death penalty

They receive further qualified backing in a new Mail on Sunday poll.

But Mrs May told this newspaper last night that the death penalty would not have prevented the  killing of PCs Hughes and Bone.

‘The murder of Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone was a callous and  cowardly act,’ she said. ‘But I do not believe in the death penalty, and I do not believe that the death penalty would have acted as a deterrent in this case.’

Nor did Mrs May think arming more police would help.

‘We have armed response units who are there to deal with specific threats, but I don’t want to see police officers routinely carrying guns.’

The complications involved in reintroducing capital punishment are illustrated in a Survation poll of 1,012 people interviewed online on Thursday and Friday.

Poll: A survey shows the public's opinion is split

A total of 48 per cent want it restored, with 44 per cent against.

If it were to be reintroduced, there is a clear preference for executing capital offenders by lethal injection, which is favoured over hanging or the electric chair.

A surprisingly high number of those who support lethal injections for murderers, two out of three, say they would be prepared to administer the fatal doses themselves.

However, when the survey delved further into public opinion, the  balance appears to tilt in the opposite direction.

It could lead to murderers having a greater chance of getting away scot free.

Nearly one in four say they would be less likely to return a guilty verdict if they were a juror in a murder trial where the accused faced the prospect of execution instead of jail.

And more than half say a higher burden of proof would be required.

Similarly, nearly half want more police to be armed.

But when the pros and cons are explored in greater detail, voters appear more equivocal.

A total of 67 per cent say carrying guns would not have saved PCs Hughes and Bone. One in five disagree.

The public believe police would be marginally at greater risk themselves if they were all armed.

And 51 per cent say it would lead to more killings by police of innocent civilians, against one in ten who say there would be fewer deaths.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.

May is also against arming officers, and does not want to see police 'routinely carrying guns'
