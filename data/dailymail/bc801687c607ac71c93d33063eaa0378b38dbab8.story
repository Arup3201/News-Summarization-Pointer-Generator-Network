Australian cricketer David Warner has defended his heated spat with Indian batsman Rohit Sharma saying he 'politely' asked him to 'speak English' - despite admitting he was wrong about the incident that got tempers flaring.

The mid-pitch argument was sparked when Warner confronted Sharma about an overthrow after the last ball of the 23rd over on Sunday during the one-day international at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. 

Warner, who has found himself at the centre of more than one sledging controversy this summer, supposedly mouthed-off at the Indian batsman over what he perceived to be poor sportsmanship for running off an overthrow that he believed came from a deflection.

'When I went over to say something to him, he sort of said something in their language and I said, 'Speak English', because, if you're going to say something, understand that theoretically I cannot speak Hindi,' Warner told Sky Sports Radio, according to News Corp.

'I did the polite thing and asked him to speak English, therefore he did and I can't repeat what he said.' 

India's belief that it wasn't a deflection was supported by a replay, but Warner says he won't apologise despite making the wrong call. 

'I was in the wrong... I shouldn't have engaged him,' he said. 'If people get on the wrong side of me, I'm not going to back down. 

'We play hard aggressive cricket but we know what comes with it, sometimes you are going to get fined.

'We've just got to keep trying not to cross that line, because we're all about playing cricket the right way.'

There's a so-called unwritten rule in cricket that batsmen don't run overthrows if the ball deflects off their body or bat.

While Sharma hesitated at first, he followed through with the run. 

Warner immediately looked on in disbelief as he walked over from his fielding position. 

As he walked past Sharma he said something and the Indian batsman's response prompted Warner to double back.

Warner was caught on camera repeatedly mouthing: 'What? Speak English'.

Umpires Khumar Dharmasena and John Ward were forced to intervene and Australian captain George Bailey had to move Warner away from the Indian batsman. 

Warner was fined 50 per cent of his match fee over the incident.

The clash comes off the back of a four-match Test series between Australia and India that was filled with tension and bad blood.

'I think Rohit was fine with it, I didn't even bother to ask what really happened,' India skipper MS Dhoni said of the heated confrontation. 

'It was between two grown men and I hope it was sorted out in the middle.'

The two teams have faced racially-fuelled trouble in the past with Indian off spinner Harbhajan Singh being banned for three Tests back in 2008 for calling Australia's Andrew Symonds a 'monkey'.

New Zealand cricket great Martin Crowe weighed in on the stoush labelling Warner the most juvenile cricketer he has seen. 

Crowe says he fears that the left-hander could be at the centre of a fight during the World Cup if things boil over and is advocating a soccer-like yellow and red card system to deal with what he terms 'thuggish behaviour' as fines don't work. 

'Warner can play, but he is the most juvenile cricketer I have seen on a cricket field,' Crowe wrote on cricket website espncricinfo.com.

'I don't care how good he is: if he continues to show all those watching that he doesn't care, he must be removed, either by Cricket Australia or definitely by the world governing body.

'The more he gets away with it, the more others will follow his pitiful actions. Already we see one or two of his teammates enjoying being close to his hideous energy.'

Sharma, who was 58 at the time, went on to make 137.

But India's Suresh Raina, who made 52, looked delighted when he took the catch that dismissed Warner for 24 during the Australian innings.

Australia's James Faulkner ended up guiding his side to a four-wicket win over India.

Australia were cruising when they needed 50 runs off the final 10 overs with seven wickets in hand, but the tourists fought back boldly to reduce that equation to 14 runs off 11 balls.

Faulkner responded with two boundaries, enhancing his status as Australia's closer as they passed their victory target of 268  with an over to spare.

Aaron Finch scored 96 and his 101-run partnership with Steve Smith piloted Australia to a point where they needed 52 runs from 63 deliveries. 

Finch reined in his natural aggression, reaching 64 off 96 balls before walloping his first six of the night.  

Warner was later dismissed for 24 during the Australian innings by India's Suresh Raina

India's total of 8-267, built on the back of Rohit Sharma's masterful 138, was proven to be sub-par on a pristine batting pitch 

Both he and Smith focused instead on swift running between the wickets and the easy ones and twos on offer.

Smith fell for 47 in the 40th over and Finch trudged off the following over as Australia slumped from 2-216 to 6-248.

Finch banked on patience instead of power batting, with the opener reluctant to take a risk following the dismissals of David Warner (24) and Shane Watson (41).

But Mitchell Starc, leading the pace attack in the absence of fellow left-armer Mitchell Johnson, was man of the match.
