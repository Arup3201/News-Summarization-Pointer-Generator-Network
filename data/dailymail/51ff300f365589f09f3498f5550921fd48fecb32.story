Some people struggle to pull off a sultry wink at the right moment, or, worse still, use them willy nilly at inappropriate times.

But some animals, it seems, have no problem flashing a wink when they choose.

Whether or not they are communicating with their single-blinks, however, remains to be seen.

Trying to communicate? The thought of a giant polar bear trying to communicate with a sultry wink will probably fill you with dread. But one photographer finds it hard not to wonder if there's any meaning in it

But for one photographer who has collected a plethora of pictures of winking animals, it's difficult not to wonder if there's any meaning in it.

Snapper  and Exodus tour guide Paul Goldstein might be forgiven for thinking the animal kingdom are trying tell him something with a tally of SIX creatures giving him the wink.

They include a polar bear, a cheetah cub and an owl appearing to be passing on a conspiratorial wink.

Squint or wink? Given the sun is shining directly at this lion, it's quite likely he's simply squinting, but there's always the chance he's communicating through winking

'It would be easy to be anthropomorphic about this but I am beginning to think this is not co-incidence,' said photographer Paul Goldstein

Paul, from Wimbledon, said: 'I have seen many extraordinary moments in the wildlife world from lion kills to drinking jaguars and cheetah and polar bear hunts to tiny tiger cubs.

'However in the last two years I seemingly have been pursued by winking animals.

'It would be easy to be anthropomorphic about this but I am beginning to think this is not co-incidence.

Even cheetah cubs appear to be able to flash a perfect wink

'It is almost as if they are checking that I have my camera settings correct, they then give me a conspiratorial wink as if to say 'you are doing it right and behaving sensitively towards me, here's your reward'.

'This is obviously humanising nonsense, but it does add a quirky edge to the photographs. Utter winkers, the lot of them.'

Utter winkers:  The wildlife photographer says it is 'obviously humanising nonsense, but it does add a quirky edge to the photographs'

Paul Goldstein has been leading photographic safaris and expeditions for Exodus for many years and was named Unsung Hero in this month's Sunday Times Travel reader's awards.

He even questioned if the animals were trying to communicate with him

But came to the conclusion it was 'humanising nonsense' - but entertaining
