Gun safety advocate: Michael Underwood (pictured) has avoided a jail sentence for the shooting of friend Nate Maki, but has a number of conditions attached to his plea deal

An 18-year-old who accidentally shot dead his friend while he had been drinking on a hunting trip has escaped jail after agreeing to become an advocate for gun safety.

Michael Bryce Underwood received a five-year probation with an automatic two-year term in prison if he violates his probation, according to a court in Montague County District Court in Texas.

Judge Vicki Isaacs also ruled that Underwood will have to finish high school, cannot drink alcohol and must speak publicly about gun safety.

Underwood was arrested in October after his friend Nathan Maki, an 18-year-old fullback for the Guyer High School's football team, was shot with a rifle during a Labor Day weekend camping trip. The teenagers had been camping with two female friends.

Maki's body was found in a pickup truck in a field near Bowie, Texas. Underwood had alerted police, who found beer cans, a rifle and a shotgun at the scene.

Underwood had told responders at the time that the pair had been hunting and he was outside the pickup truck taking aim at an animal when he shot the .22-caliber rifle, according to a search warrant affidavit.

He was sentenced after pleading guilty to criminally negligent homicide.

In court on Monday, Paige Williams, a district attorney for Montague County, read a victim impact statement from Maki's mother, who forgave Underwood for the accident.

Regarding the plea arrangement, Ms Williams told Dallas News: 'It was the right outcome for everybody involved.'

At the time of the accident, Maki's girlfriend, Peyton Bucklew, paid tribute to her 'best friend'.

'Football was everything to him,' she said. 'Those are his brothers out there. He would do anything for them. It will be hard, but I know they are going to go out there and play for him.'

Guyer Head Coach John Walsh said at the time he was shocked at the death.

Oschlor Flemming, who coaches the running backs for the high school team, added: 'Nathan [was] a great kid... He always had a big smile on his face. I don't think he had an enemy in the world.
