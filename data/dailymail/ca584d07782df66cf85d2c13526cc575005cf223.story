Ronny Deila insists he does not care if Celtic edge the title by a single point – so long it's part of a domestic Treble.

The Parkhead side find themselves embroiled in a title joust for the first time in three years, with second placed Aberdeen just two points behind going into the New Year.

Expected to romp to four-in-a-row, the champions lost to Dundee United and only managed a home goalless draw with bottom club Ross County on Saturday.

Celtic manager Ronny Deila insists he isn't concerned how his side win the Scottish Premiership

Conceding it would be 'unthinkable' to surrender the championship, Deila admitted he would settle for limping over the line by the slenderest of margins.

'If we win the Treble – yes,' he said. 'I don't care if it's one point or ten points as long as we win the Treble.

'It's all about trophies. No-one asks how many points do you win by, it's all about trophies.

'That's always been the case in history. You never remember who is No2 or how many points you win by.

'Aberdeen are getting better and are on a good run – we will see in the end how many points they get and we can get. A challenge could be a positive thing for the league but we want to win as many things as possible as soon as possible.

'I think it's important to have experience of a title race and to know what is expected of you to win things.'

Accepting Celtic are engaged in a genuine title dogfight for the first time since the financial collapse of Rangers, the Norwegian said he understands the importance of retaining the title.

'Of course, I say it all the time – winning the league is the most important thing here and that's what we are aiming to do,' he said.

'I'm totally aware about the demands for the league – that's from everyone here at the club.

'The mentality is to win and we are leading. We are ahead and if we win by 20 points that's good but the most important thing is to win.

'I think it's a transitional period. You have to compare us with the team in the first year of the previous manager.

'It's not fair to judge me against last season, If I can be here for four years then hopefully I can keep going and get a better and better team.

'We are top of the league and fighting for every single trophy in this country and still in Europe but I'm totally aware of the pressures to win the league and that's the most important thing.'

Aberdeen face St Johnstone at Pittodrie tomorrow with the chance to go top before Celtic kick-off at 5.30pm against Partick Thistle at Firhill. Deila believes the Pittodrie side are equipped to put his side under pressure.

'They have consistency and they won a trophy last year. They are a big club and of course they have a chance,' he explained. 'But we have to do everything we can to make sure they can't cope with it.

'We can't do anything about Aberdeen or Dundee United. We just have to win games and go on a run of good games.

'If you take the last 10 games, they have been good. But two haven't been good and we have to get back on track again and get the three points against Partick Thistle.

'If we keep doing that it is going to be tough to follow us.'

Celtic, meanwhile, have been linked with a move for Ajax defender Stefano Denswil.

A Dutch under-21 international Denswil has been told he can leave the Amsterdam Arena as a free agent this summer, with Dutch newspapers claiming the Parkhead side and Juventus have made early enquiries.

A potential replacement if Virgil van Dijk goes in January, Denswil's agent Winny Haatrecht said: 'Stefano's preference is basically to finish the season with Ajax.

'If he is still playing at the beginning of March then Ajax might change their mind.'
