A new 'anti-lout' law to stop large mobs of people gathering has been used for the first time to ban 500 boy racers from meeting at a retail park.

The Public Spaces Protection Order, which became law on 20 October, gives town halls sweeping new powers to outlaw any activity which may have a 'detrimental effect' on the quality of local life. 

Initially intended to clamp down on antisocial behaviour such as begging and spitting, council officers can put up signs banning an activity in a specified area, either round the clock or during specific hours.

A new 'anti-lout' law to stop large mobs of people gathering has been used for the first time to ban 500 boy racers from meeting at a retail park in Colchester

Anybody flouting the order will be liable for an on-the-spot fine, normally ranging from £70 to £100, issued by a police officer, PCSO, council worker or private security guard employed by the local Town Hall.

Colchester Council, in Essex, plans to become the first to use the law to make the car park at Turner Rise Retail Park in Colchester the subject of the Public Spaces Protection Order.

It will be the first time the new order has been imposed, and it will outlaw non-customers from the car park between 6pm and 6am. It also requires them to leave within 20 minutes.

The move comes after 500 car buffs used the retail park as a meeting place twice in the last seven months, and were accused of revving their engines noisily, playing loud music and doing 'doughnuts'.

Sgt Lou Middleton, of Colchester Police, said: 'This will make life better for businesses and residents.

'We have lots of residents living behind the retail park complaining they are constantly being disturbed by vehicle noise, screeching brakes, loud music and there is always the issue of litter.

'That is happening periodically and we know they are young people congregating there in cars.

'When police patrols go we are not finding them doing anything but it is quite clear from the residents it is causing them a disturbance.

'Those people are not going there to use the businesses, they are going there to socialise.'

The Public Spaces Protection Order, a form of Asbo, bans motorists from entering the car park between 6pm and 6am if the driver or passengers are not customers of the shops or restaurants.

Customers who use a shop or restaurant between 6pm and 6am will have to leave within 20 minutes.

The order also bans burger vans turning up and selling food without permission, which has happened in the past.

Anyone breaching the order will be fined £100.

Ministers insist the controversial orders  are intended to clamp down on anti-social behaviour, such as spitting and aggressive begging.

But the rules have been so widely drawn that councils are also planning to apply them to the likes of 'nuisance parking', children playing ball games and parents parking outside schools.

The order is set to come into force in Colchester next month and will be in place for a year. Martin Goss, borough councillor for Colchester's Mile End ward, said: 'This gives the police much more power to disperse people.

'It has been a real collaboration between police, the retail park, ward councillors and the council to take up what has been a real concern for a long time.

'This is really good news.'

Pizza Hut on Turner Rise Retail Park  opens until 10pm or 11pm, seven nights week.

Manager Stephen Hughes said: 'It has been a long time coming.

'The first time the boy racers came here was okay to an extent but after that it started to happen more regularly and the events got bigger and bigger.

'The other stores mainly close around 6pm but we are open when the cars are here.

'The takeaway sales to them are welcome but then no one else can park.

'We get the loud music and they come in to use the toilet.'

Mr Hughes said when staff had asked the boy racers not to use the toilet if they were not Pizza Hut customers some had become aggressive.

He said: 'They have even used the back of our building as a toilet. A few of the female staff members have gone out there to have a cigarette and they have been urinating.'
