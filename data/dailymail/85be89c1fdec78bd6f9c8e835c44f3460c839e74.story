A couple who spent thousands of pounds on IVF have finally had a baby after conceiving naturally.

Ian Scott-Garrett, 37, and his wife Vicky, 35, tried for a baby for seven years and spent £20,000 on IVF.

All of the IVF attempts failed but Mrs Scott-Garrett finally conceived naturally after a short spell on the contraceptive pill.

Vicky and Ian Scott-Garrett conceived Ollie naturally after spending £20,000 on failed IVF. They believe that the contraceptive pill 'reset' Mrs Scott-Garrett's hormones allowing her to conceive

Baby Ollie was born in December but had to spend the first five months of his life in Birmingham

Children’s Hospital because he was born with his oesophagus unconnected to his stomach.

Mr Scott-Garrett, a tutor at Birmingham Metropolitan College, said: ‘When we found out Vicky was pregnant we were thrilled. But when we found out that the baby had a significant health problem it was a real blow.

‘But the hospital staff were incredible and prepared us for what might happen.’

Mr Scott-Garrett had been told years earlier that he would never have children because of treatment he had for a brain tumour.

So, after seven years of trying to get pregnant the couple from West Bromwich, in the West Midlands, finally decided to put baby plans on the back burner to plan their wedding, and have one last shot at IVF afterwards.

Mr Scott-Garrett (pictured with Ollie) was told that he would never be able to have children because of treatment he received for a brain tumour

Mrs Scott-Garrett, already mother to Phillipa 12, and Christopher, 14, from a previous relationship, went on the pill to settle her hormones for six months.

But just weeks after coming off it she conceived before she had a chance to try IVF again.

She said: ‘My body seems to think it’s older than it is. My hormones are like a menopausal woman and it was making it difficult to get pregnant.

‘The doctors seemed to think that the pill has reset my body somehow and stabilised my hormones which were preventing me from conceiving.

Ollie (pictured with his mother a few minutes after his birth) was born with oesophageal atresia - a condition which meant that his stomach was not connected to his oesophagus - he had to have surgery at two-days-old

‘If I had known I would have saved the money and gone on the pill years ago.’

She added: ‘Going through IVF put a huge strain on our relationship, and we even turned to counselling.

‘The guilt of not being able to give Ian a child almost tore us apart.’

Three months before their wedding, the couple learnt that Mr Scott-Garrett’s father had terminal leukaemia and had just weeks to live.

Ollie was conceived just as they were coming to terms with the news.

Immediately after his birth in December, Ollie was rushed to Birmingham Children's Hospital where he spent the first five months of his life. He was allowed to go home in May

Ollie did not feed properly in the womb meaning his mother's stomach became so swollen with fluid that ligaments ripped off her ribcage

‘My Dad was desperate for us to have a child. It was like it was his dying wish to give us a new life as he lost his,’ said Mr Scott-Garrett.

However, the couple’s struggle was far from over.

At Mrs Scott-Garrett’s 20 week scan doctors were unable to identify Ollie’s stomach.

‘It felt like our brief happiness had been taken away from us. We had been trying for so long, and it felt cruel. “Why us?” is what we were thinking,’ said her husband.

Doctors told the parents-to-be that their baby was most probably going to be born with oesophageal atresia, where the oesophagus is not connected to the stomach, which would cause him long-term problems.

Mrs Scott-Garrett says that going through IVF put a huge strain on the couple's relationship and that if she had known the contraceptive pill could help she would have tried taking it years earlier

They were prepared by medics for the 
fact that their baby might be born not breathing, and he would have to 
have an operation to determine the full extent of the problem.

As Ollie was not feeding in properly in the womb, his mother’s stomach became so swollen with fluid that ligaments ripped off her ribcage.

She said: ‘In the weeks before Ollie was born I was so uncomfortable I could barely walk.

‘I was huge. I couldn’t sleep and could only cat-nap sitting up.

At the same time as Ollie was conceived, Mr and Mrs Scott-Garrett learnt that Mr Scott-Garrett's father, Neil (right) had terminal cancer. They believe that Ollie was his parting gift to them

The couple are now trying to raise money for the Neonatal Surgical Ward at Birmingham Children's Hospital where Ollie was cared for

‘When I went into the maternity ward I met a lady about to have twins and I was bigger than her.’

Ollie was born at 37 weeks after just a two hour labour.

Oesophageal atresia is a congenital abnormality in which the oesophagus is not connected to the stomach.

The exact cause is not known.

The condition occurs in about one in every 3,000 babies.

In more than 50 per cent of babies with oesophageal atresia there are also other abnormalities.

The condition can often be diagnosed before the baby is born as it can mean the baby's stomach cannot be seen on the ultrasound scans.

Once the baby is born it may experience respiratory distress, choking, feeding difficulties and frothing from the mouth.

Surgery usually has to be carried out shortly after birth to enable the baby to feed normally.

Babies with the condition now have a 90 per cent survival rate.

Mrs Scott-Garrett said: ‘He was 
breathing when he arrived, so me and Ian were able to give him a cuddle 
before he was taken to Birmingham Children’s Hospital.

‘Seeing Ian cuddle him for the first time was magical. But we couldn’t enjoy being a normal family yet.’

Ollie spent five months in Birmingham Children’s Hospital but was finally allowed to go home at the end of May.

The couple are now trying to raise money for the Neonatal Surgical Ward at Birmingham Children’s Hospital where Ollie was cared for.

‘The staff in the ward were angels,’ Mr Scott-Garrett said.

‘There is no other word for them. The love, kindness and care they have shown to Ollie and all of us as a family is incredible.

‘Ollie had his first operation when he was just two-days-old and we were in bits - they held us together.’

He added: ‘When we went to see him on Christmas Day the nurses had put a card next to his cot from him to us. It was so moving and meant so much to us.’
