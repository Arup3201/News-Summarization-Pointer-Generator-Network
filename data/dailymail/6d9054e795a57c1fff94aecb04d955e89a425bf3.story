A Canadian man who recently returned from a trip to Africa currently is in an isolation unit in a hospital with symptoms that fit the profile of the Ebola virus and other deadly diseases.

The unidentified man had just returned from Liberia in Africa's western region, which currently is suffering a deadly outbreak of an unidentified haemorrhagic fever, a category of fever that includes the deadly Ebola virus.

After arriving back in Canada and becoming ill, the man was taken to an isolation unit at a hospital in Saskatoon, Saskatchawan, in critical condition.

Medical officials tell the BBC that the man's illness is no risk to the general public.

The only people at risk, health officials say, were healthcare workers who were exposed to the man but failed to protect themselves from his bodily secretions.

Health officials declined to say how long the man had been in Africa. However, the province's deputy chief medical examiner, Dr. Denise Werker, that the patient became sick after he returned to Canada.

Haemorrhagic fever viruses - like deadly Ebola and Lassa Fever - can have an incubation period of up to 21 days, Dr. Welker said.

'There is no risk to the general public,' she said. 'We recognise that 
there is going to be a fair amount of concern and that is why we wanted 
to go public with this as soon as possible.'

The BBc says that Ebola-like viruses have been reported in Guinea as well as Liberia.

In Guinea, 61 people have been killed by the disease in the country's remote southern forests.

Health officials in Guinea, however, claim the fatal illness is not Ebola.

Canadian health officials are yet to confirm which illness the man has - biological samples from the man's body were sent to to a laboratory in Winnipeg for testing.

There is no treatment to cure the Ebola virus. However, the drug Ribavirin can be used to treat Lassa.
