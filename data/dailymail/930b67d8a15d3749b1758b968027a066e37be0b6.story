Mario Balotelli will face no charges for allegedly 'threatening' a woman who took photographs of his red Ferrari F12 Berlinetta after she decided not to make a formal complaint.  

Police were called to a housing estate at 3pm on October 23 in the Wythenshawe area of Manchester, where the Liverpool striker was reportedly visiting his mum Rose Barwuah.

GMP were investigating Balotelli's use of 'threatening behaviour' after the forward demanded the woman stop taking photographs of the £240,000 car he shipped from Italy during the summer.

Price: £240,000

Brake horsepower: 730

0-62mph: 3.1 seconds

0-124mph: 8.5 seconds

Top speed: 211mph 

But the case has now been dropped. A GMP statement read: 'Police were called to Pewsey Road, Wythenshawe just after 3pm on Thursday 23 October 2014, following reports of threatening behaviour. 

'Officers have since spoken to the complainant and no criminal offences were disclosed and no crime recorded. No further action will be taken.'

It is understood a woman claimed that Balotelli moved towards her daughter, who was taking a photograph of the red sports car. 

The news had come the day after Balotelli was caught swapping shirts with Real Madrid defender Pepe at half time during Liverpool’s 3-0 defeat in the Champions League at Anfield.

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers admitted he would ‘deal with’ the controversial £16million signing from AC Milan, who was substituted during the interval.
