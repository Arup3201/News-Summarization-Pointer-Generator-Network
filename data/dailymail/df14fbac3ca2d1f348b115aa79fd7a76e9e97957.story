The Russian military put on a show of strength today as thousands of soldiers marched down Moscow's streets, accompanied by hundreds of tanks and the scream of military jets flying overhead.

These images were captured in during final preparations for a Victory Day parade on May 9 to mark Stalin's triumph over the Nazis in the Second World War.

While the public holiday used to be celebrated with sombre remembrance, according to the Moscow Times, it has seen a revival under Putin and is now a cause for patriotic celebration.

This year, in a nod to the conflict in nearby Ukraine which has seen Putin's popularity soar, the Russian Black Sea Commandos will carry the flag of Crimea and its capital Sevastopol, which were annexed by Russia in March.

Russian troops will also march through the streets of Sevastopol, although celebrations in Crimea will be more muted than in Moscow.

A record total of 69 warplanes and helicopters, 149 military vehicles and over 11,000 troops will feature in Moscowâ€™s Red Square parade to mark the 69th anniversary of the end of war in Europe.

Victory Day used to be an event of solemn remembrance, according to the Moscow Times, but in recent years has become a patriotic celebration

The battle marked the last major European offensive of the War, and ended with Hitler's suicide and the eventual surrender of the Germany army (pictured, Tu-22M3 strategic bombers fly over the Kremlin)

Preparations for the parade, due to take place on May 9, have been taking place for days (pictured, a T-90 tank pulls up next to spectators in Moscow)

Spectators have flocked to see the preparations, and to take photographs of the vehicles, such as this strategic ballistic missile Topol-M launching platform

The Russian campaign during the Second World War was undoubtedly the bloodiest, with roughly 8.7million soldiers killed, and an estimated 11million civilian deaths

The Battle of Berlin, which ended with the capture of the German capital by Russian forces, lasted from April 20 until the morning of May 2

In Sevastopol, the capital of Crimea which was annexed by Putin in March, Russian troops have also been preparing for a Victory Day parade

While the holiday is usually celebrated as a joint event by Ukraine and Russia, this year celebrations in Ukraine are being toned down for fear of reprisals

On Twitter, some residents of Moscow wondered whether the jets overhead were practicing or preparing for military intervention (pictured, a soldier observes preparations from the top of an armoured vehicle)

The show of strength displays some of Russia's impressive military firepower, including this Buk-2M anti-aircraft missile launcher
