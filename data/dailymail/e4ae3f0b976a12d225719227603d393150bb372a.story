A British man has been sentenced to six months in prison by a Dubai court for pinching a woman's bottom in a bar.

Businessman Steven Sherriff, 43, was sentenced in his absence after being accused of groping a 23-year-old whilst on a bar crawl.

The investor, who lived in Dubai for seven years, was punched unconscious by the woman's livid boyfriend after also allegedly touching the woman between her legs.

There are more than 100,000 Britons who live in Dubai, and a string of cases have highlighted the difficulties for them of living in the strict Muslim emirate

He denies all wrongdoing, however, and has slammed the decision of the Dubai court.

Mr Sherriff told The Sun: 'This is insane. How can I be found guilty when one of the witnesses says I didn't do it?

'If I go to jail, it is going to ruin everything.'

His wife Betina has also leapt to the defence of her husband, saying: 'He doesn't even know how to flirt, let alone do this.'

Belfast-born Mr Sherriff had been advised by his lawyer not to attend court this week to hear the verdict against him.

The 43-year-old has vowed to appeal against his sentence.

The case highlights the difficulties faced by more than 100,000 Britons who live in Dubai.

In 2008, Michelle Palmer, of Oakham, was accused of having sex on Jumeirah Beach in Dubai

Officials in the Gulf state have prosecuted several Britons for indecent behaviour over the past five years.

In 2008, Vince Acors, of Bromley, Kent, and Michelle Palmer, of Oakham, Rutland, were given three-month jail terms for having sex on Jumeirah Beach.

They claimed they had simply been 'kissing and cuddling' and the sentences were suspended on appeal.

In 2010, estate agent Charlotte Adams and Ayman Najafi were jailed for one month by a Dubai court for kissing and fondling each other in a restaurant – a breach of strict decency laws.

Earlier this year, a British businesswoman was accused of having drunken sex in the back of a Dubai taxi.

Rebecca Blake, 29, from Dorking, Surrey, was sacked from her £100,000 a year job as a recruitment consultant after her alleged tryst with Irish welder Conor McRedmond.

Foreigners jailed in Dubai are deported immediately after completing their sentences.
