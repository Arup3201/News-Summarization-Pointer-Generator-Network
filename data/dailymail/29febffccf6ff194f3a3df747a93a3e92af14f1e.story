Police believe that a great grandmother with no known enemies or criminal links was deliberately targeted by a killer who shot her at point-blank range in the doorway of her western Sydney home.

Despite this, detectives are still yet to identify who was responsible for the execution-style murder in November.

Helen Dawson Key, 75, was found dead in her home in Toongabie on November 20, around 16 hours after her death.

She had been shot in the head just prior to 6pm on November 19, with forensics ruling that the bullet passed through the screen door before striking her.

Family, friends and neighbours cannot understand how a 'very well-liked' and 'lovely lady' met such a grim end almost two months ago.

Great Grandmother Helen Dawson Key, 75, was shot in the head at the front door of her home in Sydney's western suburbs. Police are baffled by her killing two months later

Many had come to the conclusion that it must have been a random attack or a case of mistaken identity. 

However, police have confirmed that the killer had intended to murder Ms Dawson Key before the crime, according to news.com.au.

It's alleged that investigators are yet to definitively determine a motive.

Police are still trying to identify a man who was captured on CCTV footage near the crime scene.

They believe the man will be able to help police with their investigations.

In the vision, the unknown male wears dark clothing and walks with a ‘very recognisable’ limp near the scene of the crime, according to The Daily Telegraph.

Police have appealed to the public on several occasions but are yet to make contact with the man, who was filmed in a neighbouring suburb, McCoy Park. 

The public is also encouraged to come forward with any information pertaining to the case. 

At the time of Ms Dawson Key's death, Homicide Squad Commander, Detective Superintendent Michael Willing said it was a struggle to understand why she had been the victimo of such a disturbing crime.

'Mrs Dawson Key had no known links with crime, no known enemies, and by all accounts was a well-liked and highly-regarded member of the local community,' Det Supt Willing said.

'Mrs Dawson Key’s front door was open, but her screen door was shut, so we think she might have answered a knock at the door. 

'She had lived at this address for more than 30 years and had strong links with her neighbours and a local bowling club.

'We are, frankly, at a loss as to why someone would want to target her.' 

Helen Dawson Key was a respected member of her close-knit community, a long-time member of the Toongabbie Sports and Bowling Club and was Vice President of the Ladies Bowling Club for the last fourteen years.

Friend and lawn bowls partner Mary Gibson said she couldn't understand how this could happen to  'a very, very nice lady.'

'I've only been here 12 months but Helen was a very well-liked lady, played bowls, we still don't know why,' Ms Gibson told Daily Mail Australia.'What I do know is she was a lovely person and I really loved playing bowls with her. Each week we'd have a different partner but I loved playing with her.'

Mrs Dawson Key's next-door neighbour of 14 years, Zhu Kayw, says she called the police after hearing a shot on the day that the 75-year-old was killed.

'We just heard the shot, bang that's it, just one that's all,' she said. 

'There was no trouble before that - very quiet, even the dog was not barking,' he said.

'She lived alone, her partner passed away a few years ago.

'We would just meet and say hello when we collect the rubbish bins and bills - we would say "hello, how are you? She was very friendly, yes.'

When the 75-year-old was found dead, another resident on the street, Paris Place, said neighbours were in shock. 

'Yes it's terribly sad but as residents we're not really speaking about it out of respect for Helen,' she said. 'Not that we know anything really anyway, to offer anything new.' 

It's understood that Mrs Dawson Key, who has lived alone for several years, could have been dead for up to 16 hours before she was found behind her front door. 

Helen Dawson Key was found by a friend and member the Toongabbie Bowling Club, where she had been a member for more than 20 years 

A week after her death, the Toongabbie Sports and Bowling Club released a statement to confirm that Mrs Dawson Key was found by a concerned friend and club member who noted her absence at a recent event. 

They said this was 'reflective of the friendships Helen had formed at the club, and the tight knit friendships within the community'.

'Helen Dawson was a valued and respected part of the Toongabbie community having been involved with the clubs Lady Bowlers for some 20 years. She was a committed member volunteering her time to co-ordinate the ladies activities and formed many strong friendships within the club,' the statement read. 

'The club's community is shocked and dismayed at the circumstances surrounding Helen’s death and cannot understand how a respected senior citizen and friend could come to harm in her own home.' 

Strike Force Elermore has been established to investigate Mrs Dawson Key’s death and needed the community’s help.

'What we’re asking is for anyone who was in the area around the time of Mrs Dawson Key’s death, or has information about her movements that day, to come forward.'

People are asked to speak with police if they have any information regarding the victim’s life, her movements that day, or if they were in the area on November 19.
