There were no plans by Prime Minister Tony Abbott to send any of his ministers to global climate negotiations in Peru this week but Julie Bishop quickly got that changed.

Initially, a proposal by the deputy leader of the Liberal Party, to represent Australia at the overseas summit was blocked but Ms Bishop pressed on and eventually got her way after the full cabinet supported her bid.

The Sydney Morning Herald says the minister for Foreign Affairs will arrive in Peru's capital, Lima, on Tuesday to meet with close to 200 other countries.

She will talk international climate policy ahead of next year's 2015 Paris conference, which is being held to achieve a universal agreement on climate change, from all the nations of the world.

It's believed the request was approved only on the proviso Ms Bishop take another minister with her as a 'chaperone' which is trade minister Andrew Robb.

In an interview with the Australian Financial Review before leaving, Ms Bishop said Australia needed to be represented at a ministerial level at the summit to show the country was taking the negotiations seriously.

'I think we need some successful outcomes, or some solid outcomes to set everyone up for productive negotiations throughout 2015 for an effective agreement at the end of the year,' she said. 

The effort to bypass the Prime Minister shows evidence of latest tensions brewing in the government between Mr Abbott and his ministers, also coming at a time where voters are lacking confidence in the party on climate change.

A recent Fairfax poll found that more than half (57%) of Australians thought the government was doing 'too little' on the issue. 

Government attempts to play down climate change at the G20 summit recently held in Brisbane also backfired with the issue being highlighted even more.

The Sydney Morning Herald has revealed that despite ministers repeatedly warning the Prime Minister's office against trying to shut down climate change discussions, advice was ignored.

The re-visiting of Ms Bishops proposal to travel to Lima was a clear demonstration the cabinet wanted to get it right on climate change and put the controversial issue on the agenda unlike the G20.
