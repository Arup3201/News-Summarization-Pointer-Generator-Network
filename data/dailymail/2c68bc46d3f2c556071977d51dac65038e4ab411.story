Cristiano Ronaldo headed Real Madrid into the quarter-finals of the Champions League with two first half goals against Schalke but an awful performance from the holders suggested their crown is very much up for grabs this season.

Carlo Ancelotti’s team were booed off after losing 4-3 on the night. They stumbled into the last eight 5-4 on aggregate but Ronaldo’s goals and the return of Luka Modric apart, there was little to cheer.

Ancelotti was even asked if he would be surprised if he was sacked after the performance. He said he was just concentrating on doing his job and apologised for the display: ‘It was bad for the image of the club,’ he said.

‘The reaction of the crowd was totally justifiable but it will serve to wake us up. I still believe in the team because I know what they can give but at the moment they are not giving it. We are playing very badly. We need to train more, work more, we need more of everything.’

Ronaldo headed in a Toni Kroos corner on 25 minutes to cancel out Christian Fuchs’ shock opener and when Schalke took the lead again on 40 minutes through Klass-Jan Huntelaar, Ronaldo headed in a Fabio Coentrao cross to equalise. It was his rage at the lacklustre performance from some of his team-mates more than his finishing that was most striking.

Karim Benzema scored eight minutes into the second half but Real still allowed Schalke to level on the night with substitute Leroy Sane beating Casillas with a long range shot and when Huntelaar got his second five minutes from time it left Roberto Di Matteo’s team needing just one more goal for one of the all-time Champions League shocks.

The fifth goal never came and Madrid stumbled over the line but this was hardly a performance to put fear into the rest of Europe.

The mood was set before kick-off when supporters jeered Ancelotti’s name as it was announced. The credit he earned for winning this competition last season seems to have long since disappeared. He needed a positive Champions League display from his players – he never got one.

Real looked flat going forward and were slow to cover space at the back and when Tranquillo Barnetta crossed from the right on 25 minutes, he found Fuchs with time and space to shoot past Iker Casillas.

Sami Khedira, who will leave on a free transfer at the end of the season had failed to follow Fuchs’ run and Casillas was beaten too easily.

Ronaldo turned to shout at his sleepy team-mates after he rose to head in Kroos’ corner five minutes later but Madrid did not wake up.

Schalke are starting to gain a reputation for spectacular exits from the Champions League.

The German club have been on the losing end of the highest-scoring tie of the round each time they've been dumped out in the knockout phase.

They might not have made progress, but Schalke get full marks for entertainment, as these aggregate scores show...

2014, last 16

Real Madrid 9-2 Schalke 

2013, last 16

Galatasaray 4-3 Schalke

2011, semi-final

Manchester United 6-1 Schalke 

James Restall 

A Raphael Varane back pass almost let in Huntelaar who then rattled the bar. And with his third chance inside five minutes he found the back of the net. Casillas spilled Meyer’s shot straight to the Dutchman and, against his old club, he made it 2-1.

Ronaldo stepped forward to level once again but a crescendo of whistles still greeted the half-time whistle.

Benzema put them 3-2 up on the night on 53 minutes but Leroy Sane beat Casillas from distance to cause further embarrassment. This was the first time since 2009 Madrid had conceded three at home in Europe. Ancelotti immediately brought on Modric and Marcelo for Khedira and Coentrao.

The Croatian looked to restore some control to midfield but when Huntelaar got his second of the game off the underside of Casillas’ bar the miracle looked back on for Schalke’s 4,000 following.

Gareth Bale was jeered when he shot well wide from a good position. He is a victim rather than the cause of Madrid’s malaise but is starting to struggle in front of the club’s unforgiving supporters.

He will be glad that former Tottenham team-mate Luka Modric is now back in the side alongside him. His return and Ronaldo’s reliability were the plus points for Madrid on a night when they answered more questions than provided answers. 

Around 1,000 Real Madrid supporters had voted for Ronaldo to be dropped earlier this week in a poll organized by Spanish newspaper Diario AS.

Whether they were at the Bernabeu on Tuesday night or at home clicking other online surveys it is impossible to know.

Once again Real Madrid’s Ballon d’Or had been head and shoulders above the rest and had he not been, next Friday’s quarter-final draw might even have been missing the name of the ten-times winners.
