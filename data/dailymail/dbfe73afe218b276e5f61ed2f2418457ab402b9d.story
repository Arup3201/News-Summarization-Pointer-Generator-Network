Gordon Ramsay's alleged former mistress has claimed detectives probing News of the World hacking have unearthed a cache of recorded sex messages between her and the TV cook.

Sarah Symonds, 41, said she was contacted by the Operation Weeting squad following the discovery of 'very sensitive tapes' among files seized from the now defunct Sunday tabloid.

Miss Symonds, who describes herself as a 'reformed mistress turned infidelity analyst', said the recordings were secretly made by journalists during her alleged seven-year fling with the F-Word star.

She said she feels 'vulnerable' now she knows police are trawling through and listening to 'our private business'.

Her claims come as scores of confirmed hacking victims take publishers News Corp to court, many reaping damages worth thousands of pounds.

Last night she wrote on Twitter: 'The Metropolitan Police have contacted me. Apparently they've found very sensitive tapes on Gordon Ramsay and I. Gordon's been contacted too.

Vulnerable: Sarah Symonds made the claims via Twitter last night

'I feel very vulnerable that the Met.
Police have found 'tapes of Gordon and I' and are listing (sic) to our 
private business. #operationweeting.'

In
2008, the News of the World published stories claiming Miss Symonds and
Mr Ramsay had had a clandestine affair for seven years.

Mr Ramsay has always denied the allegations, however.

Close knit: Mr Ramsay is married to Tana, 36, with whom he has four children

In
November 2008, the News of the World published stories claiming Miss Symonds and
Mr Ramsay had had a clandestine affair for seven years.

The newspaper printed pictures of the pair leaving a London hotel. She alleged they had slept together at least seven times having met at a nightclub in 2001.

Mr Ramsay is married to Tana, 36, with whom he has four children. He has always denied all Miss Symonds' allegations.

Then two years ago it was reported that Mr Ramsay's name had appeared on a list of big-name celebrities confiscated from the jailed private investigator Glenn Mulcaire.

A spokesman for Mr Ramsay declined to comment on Miss Symonds' claims.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said today: 'We do not discuss individual cases.'

Miss Symonds, who claims to have also had an affair with Jeffrey Archer, now says she has put her man-eating ways behind her to concentrate on a career as 'the world's first and only Infidelity and Relationship Analyst'.

She has written a books on cheating and runs an advice website for women in relationships with married men.
