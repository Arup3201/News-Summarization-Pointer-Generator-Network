At the very least, it's one hairy issue less for Jeremy Paxman to discuss as he returns to the airwaves.

The veteran BBC Newsnight presenter's beard made headlines when he debuted it on television last year.

But, hours after declaring online that 'beards are so 2013', he shunned his facial hair and returned to a clean-shaven look for his first appearance of the year on the show last night.

The 63-year-old's beard divided opinion and sparked busy discussions on Twitter when he first appeared with it last August.

At the time BBC radio host Danny Baker described him as a 'silly old goat'.

The presenter hit back and accused his critics of pogonophobia – an irrational fear of beards.

Before going on air last night Mr  Paxman told RadioTimes.com: 'If a chap can't shave on holiday, what can he do? Beards are so 2013.'

Paxman's appearance drew a huge response when he grew the beard more than five months ago, when he branded the BBC pogonophobic - having a fear of beards.

At the time, he explained his reasons, saying: 'I have grown a beard for the last few summers, and suddenly wondered whether I really needed to shave it off to present Newsnight.

'Unless you're lucky enough to be Uncle Albert on Only Fools And Horses, Demis Roussos or Abu Hamza, the BBC is generally as pogonophobic as the late-lamented Albanian dictator, Enver Hoxha.

'I may keep it or I may shave it off, but I think I'll make my own decision.'

He later said: 'For a glorious few days I have been a poster boy for a shadowy group called the Beard Liberation Front, which claims that facial hair invites discrimination.

'I'm finding it quite a heavy burden.'

The Beard Liberation Front has lamented the decision to go clean-shaven, saying: 'We support people's right to dress and appear as they want so, while we regret Jeremy Paxman's decision to shave off his gravitas adding beard, the choice should be entirely up to him, BBC pogonophobia notwithstanding.'
