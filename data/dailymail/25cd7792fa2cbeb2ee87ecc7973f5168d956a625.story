The boot that helped David Beckham to bend it and inspired Zinedine Zidane throughout his illustrious career is celebrating its 20th anniversary with a retro, limited edition design.

Adidas revealed the new Predator Instinct boot which is a throwback to the original black boot, with red tongue, created by former Liverpool star Craig Johnston in 1994.

Johnston's iconic prototype, which had the front of a table tennis pad held onto the boot by a rubber band, was purchased by the German sports giants two decades ago after the Aussie convinced legends Franz Beckenbauer, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Paul Breitner to test them.

Limited edition: The boot will not be available to buy and will only be worn by a select band of players

They have since become one of the most popular football boots of all time, memorably worn by Beckham and Zidane.

And Jonny Wilkinson famously kicked England to World Cup glory in 2003 wearing the rugby version of the boot.

The 20th anniversary celebration of the Predator - complete with the classic red tongue look - will not be available to buy in shops, however.

But the brand, who earlier this week announced their Â£750million 10-year kit partnership with Manchester United from 2015-16, are planning to release a new set of Predators that will be worn by a host of stars for the start of next month's new Barclays Premier League season.
