Actor Richard Dreyfuss’ wife has been arrested for a drunk driving hit-and-run.

Svetlana Dreyfuss, 54, was taken into custody June 2 in suburban San Diego after smashing her car into a wood fence.

News of the woman’s arrest was first reported Saturday morning by TMZ.

Svetlana Dreyfuss reportedly plowed into the fence, struck a high-pressure water line and then fled the scene.

San Diego County Sheriff’s deputies caught up with her two miles away in Encinitas, the site reported.

Svetlana Dreyfuss argued to TMZ that she passed field sobriety tests but was still booked for DUI and hit-and-run.

She also insisted that she guzzled only one glass of wine before jumping behind the wheel.

Husband Richard Dreyfuss has been on the wagon since 1982, when he blacked out behind the wheel and wrecked his car into a tree.
