She was the Seventies soul star who captivated the heir to the throne.

Now Three Degrees singer Sheila Ferguson is finally ready to reveal the truth about her enduring friendship with Prince Charles.

Miss Ferguson, 66, says she will disclose the secrets of their relationship in her autobiography – although admits she has not started writing it.

The singer, whose hits include When Will I See You Again and Woman In Love, has said in the past that she refused to let anything happen

She has always made clear that there was no romantic involvement, although Charles, who had met the band before, invited the Three Degrees to perform at his 30th birthday party in November 1978 – and is said to have been so besotted with Miss Ferguson that he made amorous advances. 

The singer, whose hits include When Will I See You Again and Woman In Love, has said in the past that she refused to let anything happen – but asked now whether she had contemplated the possibility of her and the prince becoming an item, she replied: ‘Let’s be real.

Miss Ferguson, 66, says she will disclose the secrets of their relationship in her autobiography

'There’s never going to be a black queen of England, so there was no future in it.’

Miss Ferguson, who has been performing in David Gest’s Legends Of Soul Tour, said: ‘Charles and I got on so well because we come from such different backgrounds.

'When he’s one-on-one, he’s got such a great sense of humour but he’s always a gentleman.’ 

The divorced mother of two still has personal letters the prince sent her.

She said: ‘He’s a nice guy. We did a lot for charity.

'Obviously once he got married [to Diana, in 1981] there was no contact unless it was about business or an event or whatever.’

Miss Ferguson, who is an ambassador of The Prince’s Trust, added: ‘The Press have always speculated that something went on between me and Charles, and they always will.

'I don’t care how many times I deny it, they always write it.

'Until my book comes out they’re not going to know the truth, which is that we were never intimate at all.

'I will explain why when I write it, and it’s very complicated.’
