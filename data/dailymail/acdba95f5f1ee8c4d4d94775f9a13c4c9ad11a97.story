The flagship event on the PGA Tour appears set for a fabulous finish on Sunday with two European Ryder Cup heroes pitted against the man who looks the future of American golf.

As he has since day one at the Players Championship, German Martin Kaymer will head into the final round with the lead but 20 year old Jordan Spieth caught him on the 18th on Saturday after holing a clutch 15ft putt for par.

It meant the amazing Spieth, who went so close to winning the Masters last month, has now completed 54 holes on this devilish layout without a single bogey, and all on his debut as well. What a truly remarkable statistic that is given bogeys and much worse are lurking at every turn.

Up there: Germany's Martin Kaymer shares the lead with 20-year-old Jordan Spieth

The only other player to complete three rounds bogey-free in the history of this event was Greg Norman way back in 1994.

The pair stand on twelve under, with 29 year old Kaymer giving up the outright lead after an untidy finish that saw him fail to get the birdie on offer at the 16th and then bogey the last. 

There is so much at stake for Kaymer. A victory here would not only earn him a cheque for $1.8 million but catapult the man who holed the winning putt at the last Ryder Cup firmly into the reckoning for this year’s match at Gleneagles. It would also mean a return to the limelight after a lean period since his heroics at Medinah.

That weak finish, though, will encourage his great pal Sergio Garcia that he can complete a spectacular act of redemption of his own. Garcia shot 69 to stand tied third alongside Australian John Senden, with the pair just three shots off the pace.

It was at this event last year that 
Garcia declared his dislike of Tiger Woods to provoke a storm of 
controversy. In a shootout with Woods on Sunday, Garcia then put two 
balls into the water at the 17th.

One last go: Jordan Spieth caught Kaymer on the 18th and also goes in 12 under

One minute he was playing for a first prize of $1.7 million and the next he was walking away with a cheque for $200,000. To compound his misery, Woods went on to win the event.

Now, a year has made a world of difference with Tiger unable to defend his title and the temperamental Spaniard once more in the mix. On the other side of the ledger to last year’s blow-up, Garcia will also be able to draw on some good memories today. In 2008, he claimed the biggest prize of his career to date with a win here.

Also in with a shout of his biggest-ever win is Lee Westwood, who won in Malaysia two weeks ago. Westwood shot 71, but might have cause to rue a poor finish of two bogeys in his last six holes. It meant he had to settle for a 71 and he will start five shots off the lead.

US Open Champion Justin Rose looked as if he would be starting on the same mark but he was assessed a two shot penalty after his ball moved a fraction on the 18th after he had addressed a chip from just behind the green.

Rose thought it had moved, and the gut-wrenching news was later confirmed when he watched a slow motion replay. It meant a 73 instead of a 71 and a five under total that surely removes him from contention.

The game could also see a new world number one, with Australian Adam Scott and Henrik Stenson poised to strike. Newly-wed Scott needs to tip-toe into the top 16 to overtake Tiger Woods and lies two shots off that mark after a 69 on Saturday. Swede Stenson is two shots nearer the lead on five under and three strokes off the top six placing he needs after a 70.

No such targets for Rory McIlroy to play for on Sunday, alas. This time last week he was saying he was getting a little bored playing for ‘back door’ top ten finishes, meaning coming through the field with a good final round.

But that, for the third successive tournament, was his only goal as he began the final round in 28th place – ten shots off the lead – after a 69. For the second day in a row he recovered from an awful front nine with a fine inward half completed in just 31 shots.

It means that for his first three rounds McIlroy has taken a total of 117 shots to complete the front nine – and just 96 blows to play the inward nine.

How’s that for a game of two halves?
