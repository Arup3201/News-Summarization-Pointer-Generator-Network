The Government has  pumped £2.8 million into Flybe to ensure regional routes between Cornwall and London continue.

The cash injection means that the airline will now be able to operate flights between Newquay Airport and Gatwick.

A further £300,000 is also being supplied by Cornwall Council in the the four-year funding deal.

There will be three flights each way on weekdays and two each way on weekends.

Aviation Minister Robert Goodwill said: 'Keeping our regions connected with London is a vital part of our long term economic plan. 

'That is why we have worked so hard with Cornwall Council to protect the route to Newquay and make sure we do all we can to support the local area.

EasyJet took over Flybe's Gatwick take-off and landing slots but decided against starting services between Newquay and the West Sussex airport

Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: 'The air link between Newquay and London is vital for Cornwall's businesses, tourist industry and residents, so I created the Regional Air Connectivity Fund and fought for £2.5 million for Newquay to ensure that this crucial service could continue.

'With a return rate of nearly three pounds for every pound invested, it's a great deal for the UK taxpayer as well as for the south west. 

'I hope this fund will help other remote areas of the UK sustain economically important connections to London too.'

Flybe had previously operated the Newquay-Gatwick route before deciding to end the service.
