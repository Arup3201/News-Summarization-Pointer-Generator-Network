Aside from the physical impacts brain damage has on the body, the loss of memory can be as devastating and restrictive.

The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is working on restoring these memories using brain implants that could reverse the loss in wounded soldiers, and benefit Alzheimer's and dementia patients.

Although the exact science behind the plans won't be announced 'for a few months', a medical ethicist has expressed concerns the technology could interfere with a patient's personality and even their conscience.

The U.S Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has revealed more details about its memory stimulator. Its implants will be used to restore memories in wounded soldiers, as well as Alzheimer's sufferers, and could involve stimulating the hippocampus, highlighted, the part of the brain involved in processing memories

As part of the project, DARPA hopes to build on neuroengineering 
advances such as implants already used to
 treat Parkinson's disease.

It will also draw on the work carried out
 on monkeys and rodents by Wake Forest University.

Studies have proved neurons in the hippocampus - the part of the brain that 
processes memory - fire differently when animals see different colours, for example.

Using
 prosthetics designed to stimulate the hippocampus, researchers were able to extend the short-term, working memory of these animals.

But to restore a human's specific memory, scientists would need to know the precise pattern for that memory.

Alternatively,
 they could restore the brain to work in a way it used to before the 
injury or damage was caused.

The brain implant plans were first unveiled in February by U.S researchers seeking contributions from relevant drug and technology companies.

During a conference at Center for Brain Health at the University of Texas at Dallas this week, project manager Justin Sanchez said: 'If you have been injured in the line of duty and you can't remember your family, we want to be able to restore those kinds of functions.

'We think that we can develop neuroprosthetic devices that can directly interface with the hippocampus, and can restore the first type of memories we are looking at, the declarative memories.'

But medical ethicist Arthur Caplan said: 'When you fool around with the brain you are fooling around with personal identity.

'If
 I could take a pill or put a helmet on and have some memories wiped 
out, maybe I don't have to live with the consequences of what I do.'

As part of the project, DARPA hopes to build on neuroengineering 
advances such as implants already used to
 treat Parkinson's disease, built by Minneapolis firm Medtronic.

The DARPA project is a section of President Obama's BRAIN initiative, created to fund research to treat common brain disorders

Medtronic's implant is 
already authorised for sale in the U.S. and similar devices manufactured by
 Minnesota's St. Jude Medical, and Boston Scientific in 
Massachusetts, are in the process of gaining approval.

It will also draw on the work carried out on monkeys and rodents by Robert Hampson, an associate professor at Wake Forest University.

He has proved neurons in the hippocampus - the part of the brain that processes memory - fire differently when animals see different colours, or pictures of food compared to faces.

Using prosthetics designed to stimulate the hippocampus, Hampson was able to extend the short-term, working memory of his subjects.

But to restore a human's specific memory, Hampson said scientists would need to know the precise pattern for that memory.

Alternatively, they could restore the brain to work in a way it used to before the injury or damage was caused to improve and develop their memory.Â 

'The way human memory works is one of the
 great unsolved mysteries,' said Andres Lozano, chairman of neurosurgery at 
the University of Toronto.

'This has tremendous value 
from a basic science aspect. It may have huge implications for patients 
with disorders affecting memory, including those with dementia and 
Alzheimer's disease.'

The DARPA project is a section of 
President Barack Obama's BRAIN initiative, created to fund research that
 could treat common brain disorders.

Eventually,
 DARPA hopes to develop a device that is portable and wireless and that 
'must incorporate implantable probes' which will both record and 
stimulate brain activity.

Sanchez confirmed more details about the plans will be announced 'in the next few months.'

Exact details are still being developed but it would build on memory studies carried out on monkeys and rats

But critics have said manipulating memories is ethically wrong
