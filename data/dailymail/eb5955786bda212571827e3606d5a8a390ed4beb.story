Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, last night called for the introduction of state-run food banks after being 'shocked' by the hungry in Britain

The Archbishop of Canterbury was warned not to become a ‘political pawn’ last night after calling for state-backed food banks.

The Most Reverend Justin Welby said he had been left more shocked by the plight of Britain’s hunger-stricken poor than those suffering in African refugee camps.

His comments came before the publication of a wide-ranging report, backed by the Archbishop, that calls for the Government to do more to eradicate hunger.

But yesterday senior Tories criticised the clergyman for supporting the ‘nationalisation’ of food banks. In addition, the MPs’ study found that families’ lack of money was not the only problem. 

The all-party Commons group on hunger warned that some parents spend far too much money on cigarettes, alcohol, takeaways and other ‘non-essential items of expenditure’ because they lack basic budgeting skills. 

Many more cannot cook even the simplest meals for their children – leaving them to go hungry.

The MPs call upon teachers to do more to report parents from chaotic households so they can receive help from ‘troubled families’ units. 

However, they conclude: ‘We should not leave the duty resting with schools. Parents have duties, and these duties are not abated by the chaos resulting from their lifestyle.’ 

The report, Feeding Britain, is released today. Chaired by Labour MP Frank Field, the all-party group calls for:

The Archbishop wrote in the Mail on Sunday how hunger ‘stalks large parts’ of the country. 

He added that he found the plight of a British family who resorted to using a food bank ‘more shocking’ than terrible suffering in Africa because it was so unexpected. 

Last night former Cabinet minister David Mellor said: ‘He’s fully entitled to make points about food banks. Where they get it wrong is talking about the Government having to do food banks.

A report into hunger in Britain found that families' lack of money was not the only barrier to buying food, and that many spent money on alcohol and cigarettes instead (pictured, a woman works in a food bank)

‘My understanding of religion ... is it’s about religious responsibility. 

'I don’t remember any part of the Gospel where people were told to queue up outside Pontius Pilate’s office and tell him to give more money to the poor. [The Archbishop] should allow himself to be aware that he shouldn’t be used as a pawn in a political game.’

Tory business minister Matt Hancock stressed that food bank dependency had risen under the Coalition in part due to greater awareness. 

‘Before we came to power, food banks were not allowed to advertise their existence,’ he said. ‘One of the reasons for the increase in use is because more people know about them.’

David Mellor said the Archbishop risked becoming a 'political pawn' after he called for the state to intervene and run food banks

Damian Green, the former immigration minister, said: ‘We have a welfare state now, but what they’re saying is the welfare state should take over food banks, should nationalise food banks.’ 

The all-party report also discloses the ‘unpleasant truth’ that some children are hungry when they get to school because of the ‘chaotic conditions in their homes’. 

‘A large proportion of primary schools that submitted evidence to the inquiry said they had witnessed children arriving at school hungry because their parents could not, or would not, wake them up to make them breakfast, or bring them to the school breakfast club,’ the report says.

Another factor behind parental poverty is the addictions that many families face. 

‘Budgeting support is terribly important, but ... is often not enough to equip families to kick their addictive habits when addiction is being fed and defended by some very powerful lobbies,’ it warns. 

The report says some parents are so tempted by cheap alcohol in supermarkets, and the plethora of betting shops on high streets, that they spend money on these rather than food for their children. 

‘A family earning £21,000 a year, for example, where both parents smoke 20 cigarettes a day will spend a quarter of their income on tobacco,’ it adds.

Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg backed the report, saying he agreed with introducing ‘yellow cards’ for benefit claimants.
