Graham Rowntree has braced Twickenham for a thunderous forward collision as England launch their final assault on the 2015 RBS 6 Nations title.

Ireland and Wales are also in the hunt for the crown on a day promising captivating sporting theatre that will unfold over three staggered kick-offs with points difference almost certain to decide the outcome.

Bringing down the curtain is England's clash with France and it is the Red Rose who occupy pole position knowing exactly what is required to win a first piece of silverware under head coach Stuart Lancaster.

Pivotal to the outcome at Twickenham will be the battle between two huge packs with muscular reinforcements awaiting orders on the bench.

'France's pack are always a challenge. They're huge men,' forwards coach and former England prop Rowntree said.

'They're always a real test. You don't get many tougher tests as a forward than playing against a French pack.

'Last weekend they used their size to their advantage against Italy. They scrummed well against Italy and drove well.

'There aren't many teams doing that to Italy at the moment and I've no doubt they'll come to Twickenham looking to do the same to us.

'Two years ago we were lucky to win here. They played exceptionally well and that was a really tough day at the office for us up front. The forward battle is just one battle we'll have to win.

'There is a real hunger and determination about the players this week. Any French team that comes to Twickenham is a handful, regardless of what's riding on the game.'
