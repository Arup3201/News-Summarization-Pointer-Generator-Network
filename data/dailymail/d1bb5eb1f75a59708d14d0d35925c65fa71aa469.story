An art thief brazenly walked into a New Orleans gallery on Tuesday, took a painting off the wall, and walked straight back out again.

The suspect, who remains at large, entered Rodrigue Studio, located at 730 Royal Street in the French Quarter, at 3 p.m. and stole the 24x26 inch painting, 'Wendy and Me' by beloved New Orleans artist George Rodrigue.

The whole incident was captured by the gallery's surveillance cameras, which clearly show the thief enter and exit the building in under a minute (video below).

He is described as a white male with a full beard, 5'8' tall, weighing approximately 165lb and aged about 30 years old.

Police say the suspect traveled down nearby Royal Street on foot towards Saint Ann Street but it is uncertain where he went from there.

The distinctive painting, valued at $250,000, features the blue dog for which Rodrigue's work is famous and was used on the artist's wedding invitations when he married his wife Wendy in 1997. It is therefore also of great sentimental value to the family.

George Rodrigue passed away in December 2013 and the painting was on exhibit as part of a retrospective of his work.

In a happy turn of events, Nola.com has since reported that the painting was found undamaged by a local rock band, Stereo Fire Empire, near Royal Street just hours after it was taken.

The band members had left the House of Blues when lead guitarist Evan Diez spotted two paintings leaning against a wall of the Omni Royal Hotel.

Diez told Nola.com: 'I'd read the article [about the missing painting] and then had to explain it to everybody... Blue Dog paintings are as New Orleans as a pothole, like everybody knows it.'

The second painting, titled 'Three Amigos' is believed to have been a print sold to a local non-profit organization through the George Rodrigue Foundation for the Arts.

Both paintings were handed in at the 8th District Police Station just a block away from where they were found. The band posted a video to Facebook that showed them handing in the stolen goods.

The group have joked that they might write a song about what they have described as their 'Scooby-doo-like adventure'. They also said they saw a man that fitted the description of the suspect walking around the area earlier in the evening.

Jacques Rodrigue, son of the artist, was overjoyed to have the special painting back in his family's possession.

The Advocate reports that the theft on Tuesday is similar to an incident in 2010, when a man took two small 'Blue Dog' paintings off the gallery’s wall, put them in a bag and walked out. Those paintings were later found in the shed of a New Orleans home, but the thief was never found.

More recently, two men were arrested after trying to sell a stolen Rodrigue painting valued at $50,000 on Craigslist. That painting had been stolen from a framer’s warehouse.

The police will now use DNA fingerprinting techniques to try and identify the suspect in the latest theft.
