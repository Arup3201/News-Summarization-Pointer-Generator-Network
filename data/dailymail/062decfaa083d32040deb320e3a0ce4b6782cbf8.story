A teenage girl is so terrified of hair that she is unable to lead a normal life - with the very sight of it making her feel nauseous, nervous and tearful.

Sixth form student Emily White, 17, from Barry, Wales, has seen relationships with boys ruined over the irrational phobia which prevents her from straying too close to people's heads.

Only recently has she managed to touch her own locks without feeling sick and doctors say the only way to cure the bizarre fear, known as chaetophobia, is to face it head on.

Emily White, from Barry, Wales, cannot go near hair without wanting to be sick and crying

Emily said: 'I just hate the texture of hair. There's something about it that makes me feel nauseous and nervous. Thick, curly hair or wet hair is the worst of all.

'My own hair used to make me feel sick too, I hate the feel of it on me. Until about a year ago, I was not even able to touch it without getting scared. 

'With a push, I will now put my fingers through my hair or stroke it.

'My mum makes me cut my hair twice a year and the experience is horrible. I despise it so much, especially when I can see my locks all over the floor.'

The 17-year-old says the condition, known as chaetophobia, is ruining her life (above her mother, Maria, attempts to comb her locks)

 Emily's worst ordeal saw her break into tears after encountering some tresses in a public toilet

She explains: 'I was at a Cardiff City football match and went to the loo. I saw a clump of hair in the sink and I screamed in front of everyone and started crying.

'I ran back to my seat in tears and everyone in the stadium was staring at me. My dad didn't know what to do. I just sobbed the whole way through the match.'

Emily's mother, Maria Gema, 42, says that she has suffered from the condition since she was a child.

Finance Assistant, Maria said: 'Emily's had her phobia for as long as I can remember. I don't know how it started.

Emily says she cannot go on dates with boys with hair while her mother says she has suffered from the rare condition since she was a child

'She used to take baths with her sister and as soon as Emily spotted a hair in the bath, she'd be climbing out. 

'Her phobia just progressed from there really. Any natural hair scares the hell out of her.

Emily claims the fear developed when she joined secondary school and says when classmated accidentally touched her hair she wwould want to throw up.

The word chaetophobia comes from the Greek word 'khaite' meaning ‘loose, flowing hair’.

Sufferers dont only fear other people's hair but their own as well.

Experts believe the fear can result from a traumatic experience such as having a really bad haircut as a child and being ridiculed for it.

Another cause can be explained by post traumatic stress after getting head lice as sufferers will fear further infestations. 

People with this phobia often try to shave off all of their hair, or have really short hair.

Psychotherapy has been known to cure the condition but medication may be needed in the very isolated cases that render the phobic person dysfunctional in society.

The 17-year-old is single and says makes dating a nightmare.

'When I first meet a boy, I find their hair really scary. I won't go near it. I don't know what their hair could be like.

'It's so embarrassing having to eventually reveal to a guy I'm dating that I have a phobia of hair. I try to say it on the third date so I can get the awkwardness out of the way.

'It took me about six months to be able to even go near my ex-boyfriend's hair. To be honest, I'd prefer to go out with a guy who has a shaved head instead. At least their locks wouldn't be near me and I wouldn't find loose clumps of it around the floor.'

Emily - who has two sisters Carys, 18 and Sophia, 12 - says she is constantly mocked by her friends and family who think her phobia is amusing.

She explains: 'My friends always tease me. They take hair from their own head and put it on my back when I'm not looking. If there's a clump of hair lying on the floor, they won't pick it up and I can't move anywhere.

'Once my friend dropped some on me and I froze. I was so scared that I couldn't move for about ten minutes. My friends were eventually forced to take it off me.

'My younger sister, Sophia, teases me too. She chases me around the house with hairbrushes and puts hair in my face. I have a go at her and tell her to leave me alone but she never stops.'

Despite the daily afflictions of her phobia, she has never sought medical help.

'I've never considered going to a GP about my problem because it seems silly. When I was younger, I would have liked to have talked to someone about my phobia though.'

A spokesperson for Triumph Over Phobia, the phobia charity said: 'Emily needs to have a course of exposure therapy to help her overcome her fear of hair.

'She will only recover if she faces her fear and she can do this by taking little steps each day.'
