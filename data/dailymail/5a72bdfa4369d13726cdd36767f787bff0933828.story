Buskers have launched a legal bid to stop squads of 'Simon Cowell Cops' judging street performers on quality.

Controversial measures enforced by Liverpool City Council give police and town hall officials power to end street performances they deem 'poor quality'.

The scheme has been dubbed 'The Simon Cowell Cops' after the music mogul who is known for his ruthless treatment of hopefuls on The X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent.

Buskers are outraged that it has been left to the musically untrained ears of police and council officers to decide who is good enough to perform on the streets of the city.

A ‘Keep Streets Live!’ campaign has now enlisted the support of solicitors to seek a judicial review on what they describe as 'restrictive terms and conditions'.

Under the regulations launched on August 1st, street performers including mime artists and dancers have to pay £20 for a permit and £100 public liability insurance a year.

The regulations are part of Liverpool City Council’s Street Management Plan backed by the Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson.

Solicitor David Kirwan said: 'Entertainment is the heartbeat of Liverpool’s culture - it defines our city’s personality and gives us inspiration through good times and bad.

'Liverpool is also the birthplace of popular music.

'I have witnessed the creative influence of street performers on our popular culture from the 1960s Merseybeat era to its role in the European Capital of Culture in 2008.

'We need our streets buzzing in order to prosper.

'This is an important campaign for our city and other towns and cities across the UK whose council leaders may be tempted to follow Liverpool’s poor example.

'While arguably trying to make improvements Liverpool City Council has created a problem - but it’s not too late to fix it.

'Some of the new measures are not only at odds with the spirit and culture of our city but also the law.

'We are seeking justice for the street performers by challenging through the courts if necessary.'

More than 3,000 supporters have signed an online petition Keep Spontaneous Street Performance Alive! being led by busker-turned-campaigner Jonathan Walker.

The 32-year-old founder of the Association of Street Artists and Performers, said: “Visitors to the city rightly expect our streets to be animated with art and music.

'The council is attempting to impose control and excessive regulation on one of the areas of city life where it is least needed.

'We are delighted that Kirwans have backed the campaign and street performers all over the city and will use their legal expertise to help us put right a wrong.'

Liverpool's buskers are fighting a City Council policy which allows police to intervene and stop 'poor quality' buskers

A Liverpool City Council spokesperson said: 'Keep The Streets Alive! are aware that, following consultation, the policy was introduced on the basis of a three-month trial.

'We aim to assess and review its guidelines by October.

'We are currently talking with as many people as possible from street entertainers and shop owners to the Musicians Union, music venues and organisations to see how, where and if the policy can be refined.'
