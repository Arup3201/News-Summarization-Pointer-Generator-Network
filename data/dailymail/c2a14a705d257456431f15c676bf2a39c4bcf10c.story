When he burst onto the reality TV 
scene as one of the original cast members of The Only Way Is Essex, Mark
Wright became synonymous with a glowing tan, pearly whites and a party 
boy lothario status.

But 
after leaving the hit ITV2 show in 2011, Mark, who fast became known for his dapper sense of style, was keen to carve a career of his own.

At the end of last year, he unveiled his debut fragrance range and now he is making his first foray into fashion, as the new brand ambassador for Littlewood's own menswear label, Goodsouls.

Echoing Mark’s suave and sophisticated sense of style, the Goodsouls collection he has styled features precision-cut suiting, retro cardigans and polo shirts, which he hopes will take wearers from date night to an evening out with the boys.

Speaking about his exciting new venture, the 26-year-old said: 'Everyone who knows me knows that I absolutely love fashion.

'I can’t wait to see the reaction to the clothes and to see other blokes wearing and looking great in the range.'

Gary Kibble, retail director for Littlewoods, said: 'We couldn’t be more thrilled that Mark has joined the Littlewoods family as style ambassador for our Goodsouls range.

'His popularity among our customer base is unmatched by any other male celebrity in the UK at the moment and we’re confident that his personal style and eye for fashion will translate into a collection that our customers will love.'
