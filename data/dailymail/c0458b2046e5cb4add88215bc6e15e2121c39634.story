An elderly man had to be winched to safety after he tumbled into a muddy river on his mobility scooter.

Emergency services said it was a 'miracle' the man - aged 93 - had not been seriously injured during the fall into Cornwall's Truro River.

An eyewitness said the pensioner had suffered cuts to his face and was very bloodied, but was conscious and trying to pull himself out of the thick mud when police, fire, ambulance and coastguard all arrived. 

The elderly man had been riding his mobility scooter when he tumbled off the side and fell into the river in Cornwall at 11am this morning and had to be rescued

He was eventually pulled free at noon today, an hour after he fell into Garras Wharf in Truro, by firefighters using an aerial platform.

Truro fire station manager Nathaniel Hooton said more than 30 firefighters were involved in the rescue.

The 93-year-old suffered cuts and bruises but was still fully conscious and talkative when emergency services arrived

The man and his scooter had fallen several feet into the Garras Wharf of Truro River where he became stuck in its thick mud and was unable to free himself

He said: 'I think anyone would be lucky to fall from that height and be in good condition. But this gentlemen is 93 years-old, and he was happily talking away.

'It is a miracle he has been able to tell us who he is, how old he is and where he is from.

'We always have the additional risk of the tide in situations like this. The tide plays a big factor. If we had had bad weather it would have been a lot more dangerous.'

Maria Wool, 18, who is a student at Truro College, 18, witnessed the dramatic rescue.

A crowd gathered at the river in Cornwall to watch the dramatic rescue as the action unfolded 

One eyewitness said the man had been trying to pull himself out before emergency services arrived but he was stuck firmly in the thick mud

Crews from the police, fire, ambulance and coastguard all arrived at the scene to assist the nonagenarian 

Witnesses said he had just driven straight off the side at the one point where there isn't any railings and landed in the thick mud several feet down

She said: 'I saw him laying on the floor after the rescue services pulled him out.

'He had just driven straight off the side at the one point where there isn't any railings.

'If he has survived then he is a very lucky man - it is a very big drop.

'There has never been a railing there but there definitely should be. I just hope he is ok.'

The casualty was taken away by ambulance. No further details of his condition have been released.

Efforts were also being made to remove the scooter from the mud before the tide comes in.

Emergency services said the pensioner had been lucky to fall from such a height without sustaining more major injuries

Rescuers said that if the weather had been worse or if the tide was changing, it could have been a much more dangerous rescue

Attempts were also being made to remove the scooter from the mud before the tide begins to come in
