A matchmaker to London’s rich and famous has revealed her top tips on how to bag a millionaire, or even a royal.

Lady Lara Asprey, 32, from Chelsea in London, runs the dating agency The Sloane Arranger.

In the last few years, she has found love for Prince Charles’s polo playing chums, top Hollywood celebrities and knighted Shakespearean actors.

The Sloane Arranger doesn’t feature a dating site where people can upload profiles of themselves – it is far too discreet for that.

Lady Lara meets each new member in person, noting down they key character traits, likes and dislikes, and general demeanour in her little black book.

She then looks through her other members and links men and women up that she thinks will work well – if there is no one on the books, she has even been known to approach potential suitors on the street.

She said: ‘Sloane Arranger is tongue in cheek but it is positioned to a demographic to people who have done well for themselves and are ambitious and smart.

‘But many of these people are just humble, composed educated and elegant. ‘I meet with people, find out if they are on the same wavelength as current members and then also who I can match them with.’ 

Lady Lara’s little black book is stuffed with the contact details of some of London’s most eligible bachelors and she now has her sights set on another millionaire’s playground – Switzerland.

So what does a woman need to know to bag one of the world’s richest men? Lady Lara gives us her guide to bagging a millionaire…

DON’T play hard to get:

Lady Lara says: ‘Women have been conditioned to believe that men will approach them because they do in other countries. 

‘You go abroad and you say, "Ignore the man, follow the rule book - play hard to get and he will approach you," but in the UK, women have to be more gentle and not overestimate male confidence.

‘Men here need a lot more encouragement than elsewhere, because Sloanes have developed as polite men.

‘It started in the 19th century with the debutante balls, where women would be escorted and presented to society – they had to be cherished.’

DON’T ask the man out: 

Lara says: ‘Whilst I have said that British men are rubbish and the rule book shouldn't apply, I do think that women shouldn't go out there and ask a man out. ‘What you should really do is encourage them a lot more - smile, use body language, use your eyebrows, uncross your legs and play with your hair.’

Would you like to date a Sloane like the cast of Made In Chelsea (pictured)? Lady Lara tells you how 

DO learn how to be funny:

Lady Lara says: ‘[Posh people] are terribly polite and often very well educated, mild mannered and self-deprecating, so they tend to rely on banter. They reply on it like a language - you often find that a date will be classed as a hit or a miss by the amount of banterous conversation they've had.

‘So it's terribly important for a woman to master the art of good banter and good conversation.’

DON’T be sexy, DO be elegant:

Lady Lara says: ‘If you go on a date, the most important thing looks wise is being elegant over sexy.

‘In order to find an eligible chap, you have to embody eligibility. ‘So it isn't about showing cleavage, leg and everything - so less is more. ‘It's about being elegant with your clothing - dress just a little bit better than you would normally. ‘Also, accessorise for the season and have a good handbag, good scarf and use of colour.’

There is a different way to date millionaires (picture posed by model) 

DO appear knowledgeable: 

Lady Lara says: ‘Show you are well-read and have a brain - don't ask what they think of Chekhov on first date, but be well read on current affairs,

‘Know what is going on in the news that day and have an opinion on things.’

DON’T pay for the first three dates:

Lady Lara says: ‘On the first three dates, the chap should pay, just because it’s good manners - he's inviting you and you are going out with him. ‘You can offer to buy a drink at the bar or something, but if you go for dinner then he should be the one to pay.’

And if it’s a celebrity you have your eye on? ALWAYS be discreet and DON’T pretend like you don’t know who they are:

Lady Lara says: ‘It's so much about discretion with celebs – they always want to choose the location, somewhere familiar where they won’t be seen.

'Also, don't play the "who are you?" card, but don't ask lots of questions either, just treat them like a normal person.’
