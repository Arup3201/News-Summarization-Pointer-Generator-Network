Mark Llewellyn, the executive producer of Seven’s prime time current affairs current affairs program Sunday Night apparently was involved in a newsroom brawl at the program's Sydney headquarters this week.

Lewellyn, a highly-regarded professional, who has been working as executive producer of the show since 2006, apparently had a disagreement with producer Paul Waterhouse over a story Mr Waterhouse had been researching. 

It is alleged that Mr Llewellyn was unimpressed with the angle of the story and 'threw' Mr Waterhouse against a wall, tearing his shirt. 

Mark Llewellyn, the executive producer of Channel 7's prime time current affairs show, Sunday night, has been accused of physically attacking a producer at the station's Eveleigh headquarters

The altercation began in the Sunday Night newsroom and carried on into Mr Llewellyn's office. 

Things apparently escalated quickly and Sunday Night reporter Ross Coulthart and producer Nick Farrow were forced to step in to break the two producers apart. 

It is understood that Seven’s human resources department is investigating the incident, after some members of staff threatened to walk off the show in protest.

Following formal procedure, it is believed that the Seven Network asked Mr Llewellyn to take a two-week advance on his annual leave. 

Mr Llewellyn reportedly sent an email around the office yesterday to inform staff that he is now on leave. 

It is believed Mr Llewellyn has been under immense pressure following extreme budget cuts at the station and huge amounts of tension in a dwindling office.  

Sunday Night has reportedly been under pressure recently after it became locking in a ratings battle with rival show Nine's 60 minutes

'They had a dust up in the newsroom in a production meeting in which Llewelyn threw him (Mr Waterhouse) into a wall,'a Channel 7 source told Daily Mail Australia.

One member of staff reportedly commented on how ironic it was that the office had recently been compelled to attend a bullying and conflict resolution workshop. 

Mr Llewellyn has carved out an impressive career within the media industry since he began in 1983. 

He was the first Australian journalist on the Iran-Iraq border at the end of the first Iraq war.

Mr Llewellyn has also covered the Cannes film festival for Today Tonight and produced the network’s acclaimed 2008 Anzac Day coverage live from Gallipoli.

The TV news boss left Nine in difficult circumstances in 2006 after he revealed in court documents that Nine’s CEO Eddie McGuire wanted to “bone” the Today show host Jessica Rowe.

Sunday Night has reportedly been under pressure recently after it became locking in a ratings battle with rival show, Nine's 60 minutes. 

It is understood Mr Waterhouse has raised the possibility of pressing charges against Llewellyn.
