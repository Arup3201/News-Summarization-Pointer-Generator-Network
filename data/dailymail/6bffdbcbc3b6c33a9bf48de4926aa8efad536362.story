He may have officially withdrawn from the Queensland election but Jason Deller has somehow still managed to get 222 people to vote for him in the Kawana district.

But Daily Mail Australia understands that police from the Child Protection Investigation Unit on the Sunshine Coast have opened a case following the incident in a suburban cafe, with charges still on the cards. It's also believed the matter is likely to be referred to the Department of Communities and Child Safety.

The confronting CCTV footage shows Mr Deller pouring water from a jug over his baby boy's head and then slap his toddler son across the front of the head, before pulling the baby out of the high chair and storming out of the eatery.

The one-time Queensland Independent candidate can be clearly viewed on CCTV raising his hand to slap his toddler son across the head

The force of the blow leads to the child losing his balance and sliding from the table

The father-of-four was earlier caught on camera pouring cold water from a jug on his baby son's head at a cafe. The incident is being investigated by Queensland Police Child Protection Investigation Unit

One of Mr Deller's corflutes is pictured having been pushed over ahead of the election last Saturday. Outgoing Attorney-General Jarrod Bleijie has retained the seat of Kawana for the LNP

The father-of-four and award-winning engineer eventually succumbed to the intense public pressure and announced he would withdraw from Saturday's ballot, saying 'I am completely devastated about how the event has been presented in public'. 

However, according to the latest figures from Electoral Commission Queensland, in a field of six listed candidates, Mr Deller has managed to attract the support of 222 first-preference votes, just under 1 per cent.

Incumbent Jarrod Bleijie, the outgoing Attorney-General, has retained the seat for the LNP.

Despite suggestions to the contrary, Queensland Police have not ruled out laying charges against the one-time political aspirant. 

Surveillance video from inside the cafe shows the Engineering Your Life founder casually walking over to his infant son sitting in a high chair and pouring cold water from the jug all over the small baby.

While Mr Deller walks away to put the jug back - his toddler son, who is standing on his chair, begins to climb on the table before pouring out his drink from a cup onto the floor.

His father witnesses the behaviour and walks over to the young boy and swiftly smacks him across the head, so hard that the stunned youngster slides down off the table. 

Mr Deller pulls then proceeds to pull his baby son out of the high chair and walk out of the cafe.

'Unfortunately I reacted inappropriately and gave him a clip over his ear. I sincerely apologise to my son, and wife and to those who witnessed this incident,' Mr Deller said before withdrawing from the election

Despite being caught out smacking his child in public and dropping out of the election on Friday, Mr Deller received 222 votes at the Saturday poll

A diner recognised the aspiring politician and called the police who have questioned Mr Deller but, as yet, no charges have been laid.

His wife, who is seated at the table throughout the entire incident, finishes her meal before picking up her toddler son to follow her husband out of the cafe, much to the astonishment of the other diners. 

A diner recognised the aspiring politician and called the police, who have questioned Mr Deller but, as yet, no charges have been laid.

Mr Deller stood down on Friday afternoon, reading from a written statement, he said: 'Last Sunday whilst having breakfast with my wife and family at a café in Buddina on the Sunshine Coast, a series of very challenging events led me to become frustrated and upset with the behaviour of my three year old son.'

'Unfortunately I reacted inappropriately and gave him a clip over his ear. I sincerely apologise to my son, and wife and to those who witnessed this incident.

'The incident was part of a series of a very challenging events which we had to deal with on Sunday morning, not unlike any other day with a child who has behavioural issues.'

He went on to say: 'As many parents know, it is sometimes very hard to discuss these issues outside of friends and existing support services that we confidentially engage to support me and our family.'

'As a father, I work hard to provide the love and support that young people need to grow up as happy and healthy adults.

'I am completely devastated by how this event has been presented in public but fully understand my responsibilities as a male and father to ensure the safety and care of my family and children. We will continue to work with our family and support services.'

'I entered this campaign to make a difference in the community, however out of respect for the community perception and well-being of my family, I intend to withdraw my candidacy as an Independent for Kawana at the election tomorrow.

'I will devote my time to continuing to nurture my beautiful family and regain our strength as a family and will help the community wherever possible.'

Before his tearful statement he had said such incidents could be seen in parks daily and wouldn't be surprised if it occurred in most family homes but added that he did not condone such behaviour

'The matter is a delicate issue, but there is nothing more to follow up – that's the end of it,' he claimed, also suggesting that 'things get reported differently to the way they actually happened, this has completely been taken out of context.'
