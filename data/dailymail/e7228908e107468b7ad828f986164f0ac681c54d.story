Rapper Imir R. Williams - who also goes by the stage name Mirkat – has pleaded guilty to beating a star of the TV series Amish Mafia.

Williams admitted on Thursday to assaulting and stalking girlfriend Esther Schmucker, who appears on the Discovery Channel show based in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.

Authorities say Williams repeatedly punched Schmucker on October 31 at her Strasburg home and broke her nose, cheekbone and several teeth.

Violence: Imir R. Williams, 24, pleaded guilty to aggravated assault

Scene: The couple live on this block in Strasburg, Lancaster County, which is close to the set of Amish Mafia.

The Intelligencer Journal/Lancaster New Era reports Williams had been jailed for the past seven weeks.

He was released on bail on Monday after serving a month more than the standard penalty for such charges.

Williams was placed on probation for three years and ordered to have no contact with Schmucker.

After attacking girlfriend Esther Schmucker, Imir R. Williams drove her here, to Lancaster Regional Medical Center, to have her injuries treated. When asked by staff what happened, Schmucker told them her wounds were inflicted by a female because Williams was at her side at the time

Schmucker is one of the stars of Discovery series Amish Mafia, which is now in its second series. It is part documentary, part re-enactment drama about the Amish men who protect their clan in Pennsylvania

The 27-year-old victim says she's disappointed Williams wasn't charged with a harsher crime.

Williams is not on the program.

Schmucker  has previously filed at least three protection-from-abuse orders against Williams. However, she failed to attend any of the court hearings so they were dismissed.

The
 latest criminal complaint against Williams - who is black, 6-foot-4 and
 weighs 210 pounds - stated that he assaulted her between 1 and 2 am 
on Halloween at the home he shared with Schmucker.

Esther Schmucker has previously filed three protection-from-abuse orders against boyfriend Imir R. Williams

Police
 were alerted to the incident by officials at Lancaster Regional Medical
 Center after Shmucker arrived for treatment for a broken nose, a facial
 fracture and numerous broken teeth.

Shmucker
 was reluctant to discuss what had happened with the medical staff, 
initially saying her attacker was female, according to Lancaster Online.

She then went into Strasburg police station and officially reported the assault.

Schmucker
 told officers she was afraid to tell medical personnel who had beaten 
her because Williams stayed with her as she was being treated. 

Candice
 Klase, a roommate of Schmucker, provided a written statement to 
police, saying that Williams wouldn't leave Schmucker's side in the 
three days following the attack, 'like he was guarding her'.

'She was in fear... to tell the nurse that Williams was the person that did it,' police wrote in a court affidavit.  

In
 the PFA petitions filed this summer, Schmucker maintains Williams 
sexually assaulted her, beat her and threatened to kill her several 
times.

'He told me he will chop me into pieces and throw me in the garbage can,' she wrote in one petition.

'He told me multiple times that he is going to kill me and that he just has to figure out how to do it,' she also wrote.

Police said they are 'very familiar with this couple'.
