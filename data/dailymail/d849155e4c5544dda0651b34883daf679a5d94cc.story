Junior doctors will be encouraged to work longer hours by opting out of the European Working Time Directive, the Government has said (file picture)

Junior doctors will be encouraged to work longer hours by opting out of the European Working Time Directive, the Government has announced.

It says greater flexibility is needed to boost training time for young doctors – some of whom spend almost six fewer working weeks in training than in the past.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he accepted recommendations from an independent taskforce which found European restrictions on the working week have led to cancelled operations and clinics.

Patients often see four or five different doctors a day because of shift patterns, while juniors are getting less hands on experience than in the past.

EU law limits doctors to a 48-hour week in order to stop long working weeks of 70 or 80 hours or more in the NHS.

More than 90 per cent of juniors now work shifts, usually 12 hours in length, but they must have rest periods to make up for being on call overnight, even if they are asleep.

As a result, clinics and outpatient appointments are regularly cancelled as there are not enough doctors to take them.

The Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) found junior surgeons today will have lost out on 128 days of training by the time they qualify.

The taskforce, overseen by RCS president Professor Norman Williams, recommended in April that doctors should be encouraged to opt out of restricted hours and given extra training away from wards.

Junior doctors are allowed to opt out of the directive, fully implemented in 2011, but many trusts discourage the practice because they are reluctant to pay overtime.

Trainees say they feel forced to break the rules in order to become good consultants or falsify time sheets.

The Department of Health says it will 
explore ways to encourage more widespread use of the individual opt-out 
‘where it is safe to do so’.

Mr Hunt said ‘We will never go back to the past with tired doctors working long hours, but it is clear that the Directive does have a negative impact on the training of doctors in some specialities.

‘We will now look at how training and working time could be separately identified so we can give doctors the flexibility they need.’

However, Dr Mark Porter, chair of the British Medical Association Council, said ‘No one wants a return to the days where doctors were working dangerously long hours, and it’s important that the government has recognised the Working Time Directive has been key in bringing doctors’ hours down to safe levels.

‘We have to remember that the work and training of junior doctors are inseparable. This leads to unique pressures that can’t be resolved just by increasing working hours.

‘Having the right degree of flexibility in the system is important, but we must not create a culture in which doctors feel pressured into opting out of the 48 hour weekly limit that protects patients.’
