Support: Janis Sharp and Trudie Styler with the book Gang Of One by Gary Mulgrew, one of the Natwest Three, about his time in a U.S. jail following his controversial extradition

Gary McKinnon’s mother marched on 10 Downing Street yesterday to condemn the ‘barbaric’ treatment of her son.

Janis Sharp went to the Prime Minister’s official residence to mark a decade of ‘fear and torment’ since her son’s arrest for computer hacking.

Flanked by backers including Trudie Styler, MP David Burrowes and civil liberties campaigner Shami Chakrabarti, she handed in poetry written by supporters.

Speaking outside No 10, Mrs Sharp said her son was afflicted by a ‘terror that consumes his every waking moment’.

Mr McKinnon, 45, is wanted by the US authorities on charges of hacking into NASA and Pentagon computers from his home in north London.

But the Asperger’s sufferer says he was looking for evidence of ‘little green men’.

Experts say forcing him to go to America, where he could face a 60-year jail sentence, could lead to him taking his own life.

The case has highlighted the ‘unfairness’ of the 2003 extradition treaty between Britain and the US - and sparked the Mail’s Affront to British Justice Campaign.

Mrs Sharp said: ‘Ten years have gone by and still Gary lives in a nightmare world - unable to control the terror that consumes his every waking moment.

‘This endless pressure on an Aspergic man with severe mental health issues is barbaric.

‘And for what? A foolish act that caused embarrassment to the US. Where has our sense of proportion gone?’

She added: ‘He can’t deal with it. He sits in the dark - it’s ruined his life. His mental health has deteriorated and it’s ruined our lives.’

She also urged Prime Minister David Cameron to raise the issue with Barack Obama when the two leaders meet at the White House next month.

Also lending support at Downing Street was Richard O’Dwyer, who faces being sent to the US on charges his lawyers say are not even a crime in this country.

The 23-year-old student is accused of breaking American copyright laws. He set up a website from his halls of residence in Sheffield listing places where films and TV programmes could be illegally downloaded.

But legal experts say this is not an offence because he did not download any of the entertainment himself.

His mother Julia, a pediatric nurse, said: ‘To be fighting this situation for ten years and for Gary and the family having this hanging over their lives for all this time is disgusting.

‘He has more than paid his penalty - and the US is picking on him because he embarrassed them.’

Miss Chakrabarti, director of the civil rights group Liberty, said: ‘I cannot believe it has been ten years. After all the promises that have been made by many politicians we are still here.

‘Janis Sharp is doing this for her son but she is also doing it for everyone else’s sons and daughters.’

‘As Gary’s ordeal continues so does the current rotten extradition regime. No-one is immune from unfair treatment and the lack of compassion in the system is already devastating too many lives.’

Home Secretary Theresa May agreed to delay his extradition in 2010 and is examining psychiatric evidence before she makes a final decision.

Last month two judges sitting in the High Court ruled Gary’s ordeal must be decided by the summer.
