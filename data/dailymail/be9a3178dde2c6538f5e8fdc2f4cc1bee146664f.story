Lyndsey Roughton is battling a third brain tumour. She hopes to travel abroad to Vietnam

A woman who beat two brain tumours while raising thousands of pounds for charity has vowed to fight on - after she was told she has just months to live.

Lyndsey Roughton, 27, was twice given the all-clear - but her brain tumour has returned more aggressively than before - and surgeons are unable to operate.

Doctors say she has between just two months and two years to live but despite her bleak prognosis, Lyndsey refuses to give up hope.

She said: 'I don't really listen to what they 
say.

'They told me that the first two tumours were incurable but I got 
rid of them so I'm hoping to prove them wrong again.'

The
DJ manager from Manchester has vowed to continue her work to raise cash
for The Christie, where she is undergoing chemotherapy.

She has raised thousands of pounds through charity events and took part in the Manchester to Blackpool bike ride.

Lyndsey
first fell ill in autumn 2009 when she started suffering from severe 
headaches and blurred vision. At first she put her symptoms down to her 
hectic lifestyle but a scan revealed a brain tumour.

Ms Roughton responded well to treatment at The Christie and thought her life was back on track.

However, in 2010 she was struck down 
by a second brain tumour. The doctors couldn't remove the whole growth 
so she then underwent radiotherapy. Lyndsey bought a dark wig after 
losing much of her hair around four weeks into the treatment.

She wrote on her website: 'I knew I just had to get on with it as there was nothing I could do.'

Again she battled through receiving the all-clear before Christmas in 2011.

But just months later Lyndsey started
to suffer the familiar headaches and sickness.

In April doctors told 
her the cancer had returned - and this time it was terminal. She was 
diagnosed with a grave IV glioblastoma, which is the most aggressive.

Lyndsey said: 'The doctors have to tell you the worst and I'm very much about thinking positively.

'I really love my music and I was supposed to be going to Ibiza this year.

'A few weeks before I was due to go I found out about my third tumour so it meant I couldn't go - I have to believe that I'm going to beat it and will spend next summer in Ibiza.'

Doctors said trying to remove the tumour this time would negatively effect Lyndsey's quality of life. Instead she is currently undergoing chemotherapy.

The average life expectancy for someone with a glioblastoma is one year. Around six per cent are alive five years after diagnosis.

Lyndsey said her dream is to go to Thailand and Vietnam and her friends and family want to raise Â£10,000 to send her there.
