Gu Kailai was handed a suspended death sentence yesterday for murdering British businessman Neil Heywood.

However, in a bizarre twist, there was fevered speculation that it wasn’t her in the dock.

China was yesterday abuzz with the suggestion that the politician’s wife employed a ‘lookalike’ to take her place in court.

Gu looked plumper than before – in 
contrast to most Chinese prisoners who lose weight in jail – and experts
claimed the woman who appeared for sentencing could not be the real 
accused.

Two security experts ‘familiar with 
facial recognition software’ said that the person shown in state 
television footage of the courtroom was not Gu.

Pictures showed her wearing a white 
shirt and black suit in the dock, where she stood calmly and praised the
guilty verdict against her.

‘I feel the verdict is just and fully 
reflects the court’s special respect for the law, its special respect 
for reality and, in particular, its special respect for life,’ she said.

She apologised for the ‘great losses 
to the [Communist] party and the country, for which I ought to shoulder 
the responsibility’ and described the case as a ‘huge stone weighing on 
me for more than half a year’.

Chinese state security yesterday 
blocked the term ‘body double’ being searched after the suggestion 
spread like wildfire on the internet.

Though it may seem far-fetched, 
the use of a body double by the rich and powerful in China to take their
place in courtrooms has been well documented.

Facing trial: Gu Kailai, 52, and aide Zhang Xiaojun, 33, are escorted into the Hefei City People's Court

No contest: During the trial Gu and Zhang did not raise any objections that on November 13, 2011, they went to Heywood's hotel room and, after getting him drunk, administered a fatal poison

The court room in Hefei, Anhui province was packed with people listening to hear the fate of the murderer. She avoided the death penalty

If true, the real Gu, 53, could  have 
done a deal with Communist Party chiefs and be spending her time under 
house arrest in far  more comfortable surroundings than a jail.

Gu’s execution was suspended for two 
years, meaning that unless she commits any further offence she will be 
spared the bullet.

She – or her double – faces a life sentence, which in
reality is about 14 years, with some experts predicting the sentence 
could eventually be reduced even further with behind-the-scenes deals.

Gu was convicted of murdering Old 
Harrovian Mr Heywood with cyanide after luring him to a hotel room in 
Chongqing, southwestern China, last November.

Foreign media were barred from the court.

Afterwards, a court spokesman said 
that Gu’s sentence had  been reduced because the judges believed Mr 
Heywood had ‘used threatening words’.

The court also found Gu’s actions reflected a ‘psychological impairment’ but did not elaborate.

During Gu’s one-day trial two weeks 
ago, the court was told Mr Heywood allegedly threatened to ‘destroy’ her
British-educated playboy son, Bo Guagua, 24, unless he was paid 
£13million.

The sum was supposedly a 10 per cent 
commission on a vaguely described £130million property deal that went 
sour between  Mr Heywood and Mr Bo, whom he had once mentored to win a 
place at Harrow.

Gu is the wife of Bo Xilai, a rising 
Communist Party star tipped to rule China until his wife was accused of 
murder.

He is now under house arrest while his fate is decided.

Chinese propagandists say Gu had a 
‘wolfish appetite for sex’ and that MI6 pressed Mr Heywood to seduce her
to prise communist secrets from her.

Friends of Mr Heywood, a 
41-year-old who lived in Beijing with his wife Lulu and their two young 
children, describe the claims he had an affair with Gu as preposterous.

Micro-bloggers believe the government 
used a stand-in for Gu at the trial because her appearance has changed 
so radically since she has been in custody.

Some are blaming her puffy appearance on the medication used to treat her ‘mental state’, though few are convinced.

In 2009, a Chinese hospital president 
who caused a deadly traffic accident hired an employee’s father to 
‘confess’ and serve as his stand-in.

In another case, after hitting and 
killing a motorcyclist, a man driving without a licence hired a 
substitute for £5,000.

The practice is so common that there 
is even a term for it – ding zui. Ding means ‘substitute’ and zui means 
‘crime’, in other words, ‘substitute criminal’.
