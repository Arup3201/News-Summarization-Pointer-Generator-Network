Last week, more than 117,500 people in the Bay Area were left without power after a massive storm made landfall in Northern California.

While states such as California have to deal with power outages relatively frequently, a new US study suggests other metropolitan areas could soon be heading for the same fate.

Researchers in Maryland created a computer model that predicts New York City, followed by Philadelphia, Jacksonville and Virginia are at severe risk of being left in the dark.

The model combined, data on the risk of severe weather patterns as a result of climate change, along with information on the vulnerability of power grids. 

There is good news for people living in Memphis, Dallas, Pittsburgh, Atlanta, and Buffalo, whose future risk of outages is unlikely to dramatically change. 

Seth Guikema, a professor in the university's Department of Geography and Environmental Engineering, said his team's analysis could help metropolitan areas better plan for climate change.

This graph shows the scenarios for landfall loss. To create the landfall scenarios, the first divided the entire coastline into segments labelled 1 to 98, starting at the Texas-Mexico border and ending at the Maine-Canada border. Landfall 2 spreads the distribution out more, Landfall 3 focuses more on the Gulf of Mexico, Landfall 4 shifts the distribution towards the mid-Atlantic, Landfall 5 concentrates more on the Florida peninsula

'We provide insight into how power systems along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts may be affected by climate changes,' said Professor Guikema.

'If I'm mayor of Miami, we know about hurricanes, we know about outages and our system has been adapted for it. But if I'm mayor of Philadelphia, I might say, "Whoa, we need to be doing more about this."'

Not surprisingly, lead author of the paper, Andrea Staid, found results depend strongly on location. If climate change intensifies hurricane activity, some areas of the US would feel the impact more than others.

Cities already in the eye of the storm, such as Miami and New Orleans, would remain so.

But cities such as New York City and Philadelphia, as well as some more inland urban areas, would likely be increasingly susceptible to more frequent and intense storm activity, the team found.

For both New York City and Philadelphia, the 100-year storm scenario - which is the level of storm impacts expected to be exceeded on average once every hundred years - would be 50 per cent higher.

In that same type of 100-year storm situation, the researchers predict about a 30 per cent increase in the number of customers without power in Miami and New Orleans relative to current climate conditions.

In more geographically protected cities, such as Baltimore and Washington, there would be about a 20 per cent increase in the number of customers without power in the 100-year storm.

'The range of results demonstrates the sensitivity of the U.S. power system to changes in storm behaviour,' Professor Guikema said.

'Infrastructure providers and emergency managers need to plan for hurricanes in a long-term manner, and that planning has to take climate change into account.'
