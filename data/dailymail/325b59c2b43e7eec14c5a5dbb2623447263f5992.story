Pakistan's ambassador to the U.S. resigned last night just days after a businessman said he was behind a memo that accused the Pakistani military of plotting a coup in May.

Envoy Husain Haqqani said in a Twitter message that he had sent his resignation to prime minister Syed Gillani. State television said it had been accepted.

In a statement, Mr Haqqani said: 'I have resigned to bring closure to this meaningless controversy threatening our fledgling democracy.

'I have served Pakistan and Pakistani democracy to the best of my ability and will continue to do so.'

Pakistan today moved quickly to fill the vacant post after tension between the civilian government and military by appointing Sherry Rehman, a former information minister and human rights campaigner, as Mr Haqqani's successor.

Her appointment came as a surprise, with many analysts and media pundits expecting someone seen as closer to the military.

Businessman Mansoor Ijaz, writing in a column in the Financial Times on October 10, said a senior Pakistani diplomat had asked that a memo be delivered to the Pentagon.

It pleaded for U.S. help to stave off a military coup in the days after America's May 2 raid that killed Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, he said.

Mr Ijaz later identified the diplomat as Haqqani, who denies involvement in the memo.

No evidence has emerged that the military was plotting a coup and the Pentagon at the time dismissed the memo as not credible.

Mr Haqqani today said: 'I still maintain that I did not conceive, write or distribute the memo.

'This is not about the memo. This is about bigger things.'

He declined to comment further.

Mr
Haqqani's resignation followed a meeting with Pakistan President Asif 
Zardari, the nation's powerful army chief General Ashfaq Kayani and its 
intelligence head, Lieutenant-General Ahmad Shuja Pasha.

A spokesman for the prime minister's office said Mr Haqqani was asked to resign and there would be an investigation into the memo.

Mr Haqqani is a former journalist who covered Afghanistan's civil war and later wrote a book on the role of radical Islam and the military in Pakistan.

With his crisp suits and colourful turns of phrase, he has developed close ties with Washington's top power brokers as Pakistan's envoy since 2008.

In the past year, he has sought to ease tempers in both capitals and find common ground during an extraordinarily tense period in U.S.-Pakistani relations that included the Bin Laden raid, the jailing of a CIA contractor, and U.S. accusations that Pakistan backed a militant attack on its embassy in Kabul.

He is close to Zardari but estranged from Pakistan's military.

Tensions between Pakistan's civilian 
government and military have bedeviled the nuclear-armed South Asian 
country for almost its entire existence, with the military ruling the 
country for more than half of its 64-year history after a series of 
coups.

Mr Haqqani's resignation was seen by 
many analysts as further weakening the civilian government, which is 
already beset by allegations of corruption and incompetence.

Imtiaz Gul, a security analyst in Islamabad, said: 'The military may expect much more from the government, much more beyond the resignation of Husain Haqqani, because they see that everybody perceived to be involved in this affair will be seen as anti-military and by implication anti-state.'

Vali Nasr, a former senior State Department official who worked on Pakistan, said the issue would be unlikely to have a major impact on the strained U.S.-Pakistan relationship unless it seriously weakened or toppled the civilian government.

As U.S. officials focus on thorny diplomatic and security issues with Pakistan, Mr Haqqani's departure did not immediately make many visible ripples in Washington.

Democratic Senator John Kerry, who has been heavily involved in U.S.-Pakistani relations, said he was sorry to learn of Mr Haqqani's resignation.

Senator Kerry said he respected the Pakistani government's decision but that Mr Haqqani would be missed 'as we continue to work through the ups and downs of our relationship'.
