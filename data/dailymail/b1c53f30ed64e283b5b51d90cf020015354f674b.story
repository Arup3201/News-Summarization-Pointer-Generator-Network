This is the Dutch millionaire suspected of flooding the continent with 50,000 tons of 'beef' that has had to be urgently recalled amid fears it contains horse meat.

Willy Selten, of Oss, Netherlands, is the owner of Wiljo Import en Export BV and Vleesgroothandel Willy Selten - the firms identified earlier this week by Dutch officials as having sold the enormous consignment of suspect beef.

Earlier this week the Netherlands Food 
and Consumer Product Safety Authority said 370 companies around Europe 
and 132 more in the Netherlands were affected by the vast recall, because 
they bought meat from the two companies.

Accusations: Dutch tycoon Willy Selten owns two meat wholesalers under investigation in the Netherlands

Supplier: Willy Selten owns Vleesgroothandel Willy Selten in Oss, named this week by Dutch authorities as a supplier of the enormous consignment of dubious meat

The British Food Standards Agency has 
confirmed that some of the dubious meat, sold by Selten's firms between 
January 2011 and February this year - came to factories supplying UK 
supermarkets.

Last year meat supplied by Selten's wholesaler tested positive for the veterinary painkilling drug phenylbutazone - or bute.

This year his factory was shut down temporarily and Selten was taken to court in February, but he was later allowed to begin operating again under strict supervision, according to a report in the Mirror.

The report said the tycoon is facing legal action from some employees after failing to pay his workers since the beginning of March.

'Quiet': Neighbours who live close to Willy Selten's home near Oss, Netherlands, have described him as a 'family man' with an 'aristocratic air of wealth'

Father-of-two Selten, described by neighbours in Oss as a 'quiet family man' with an 'aristocratic air of wealth', admitted mixing horsemeat with fat from beef after the court case in February, when he is said to have told a reporter: 'Yes, we've processed horsemeat.

'There was also horsemeat mixed with fat from beef, ordered by and in co-operation with a company that delivered the horsemeat,' he added at the time.

Of the decision to allow Selten to continue operating after the court case, a spokeswoman for the Dutch Food Safety Authority said its policy in the Netherlands is that 'everybody should be given a second chance'.

Following the recall of thousands of tons of meat this week, the Dutch food authority said in a statement that, because its exact source could not be traced 'its safety cannot be guaranteed'.

It added that Dutch authorities had 'no concrete indications that there is a risk to public health'.

The British FSA said earlier this week: ‘We have been informed by the Dutch authorities that a small number of UK businesses may potentially have received products from the company implicated in their investigation.'The FSA is following up with these businesses as a matter of urgency to determine if they have received products from the Dutch company.’The suspect shipments began in January 2011, according to the European Commission.A spokesman said: ‘At this stage, the origin of the meat is unknown but the Netherlands authorities acknowledged that horse meat had been mixed with beef.’Other countries known to have bought the affected meat include France, Germany and Spain.

Probe: Selten's factories were closed in February and he faced a court case, after which he was allowed to trade again under supervision

Officials in the Netherlands admitted yesterday it was probably too late to recover most of the recalled beef because much of it probably has been eaten in the past two years.

Some of the meat may be in frozen meals with long expiration dates still in supermarket freezers, it said.

'We do not know [exactly] how much has been eaten or sold. We expect that a reasonable amount has been eaten because we are talking about [a] period of over two years,' Benno Bruggink, spokesman for the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority, said.

The food authority fears the beef may have been mixed with horsemeat because Dutch meat exports labelled 'pure beef' tested in March contained horse.

There have been no indications the meat is harmful if eaten, but the Dutch food authority said because the origin could not be verified it had been declared unfit for consumption.

Dutch authorities have warned the European Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed, which had ordered a recall by national authorities.

Willy Selten has not commented on this week's recall.
