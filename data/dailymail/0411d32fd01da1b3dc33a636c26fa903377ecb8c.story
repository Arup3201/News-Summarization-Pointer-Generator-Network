On a freezing night last February, the body of 13-year-old Mackenzie Howard was found lying in the back porch of the church in the tiny, remote village of Kake, Alaska. She had been battered to death.

In one of the world’s most hazardous natural environments, the real dangers for women living in the Arctic come not from polar bears or cracking ice but from the men they live among.

Mackenzie Howard’s body lay outside the church in Kake for 11 hours after it was found. With a population of 559, Kake is just one of 75 remote Alaskan villages with no police force.

The state currently employs one trooper for every million acres and it’s the same story across the Arctic.

Of the 53 communities in the Arctic Canadian province of Nunavut, only 28 have Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) detachments. 15 of these are staffed by only two people. 

In the absence of police, according to a report into Mackenzie’s murder in the Washington Post, Kake residents were forced to set up a rota to guard the body and patrol the village.

Since the only way out of Kake is by plane or boat, the killer was still at large in the community. State troopers arrived the following morning. It took investigators another few hours to make the journey from Anchorage, 1000 miles away. 

Speaking to the Washington Post, Teresa Gaudette, chair of Kake’s public safety committee, said, ‘It can be terrifying. When something happens, we have to call 911 to get a state trooper to come.

'Then, it can take a few hours to a day or two…by the time they get here, sometimes nothing can be done because there’s no evidence. People can just get away with it.’

Mackenzie’s mother, Marla Howard, added: ‘People don’t really fear the law here.’

They have reason not to. Even where it exists, law enforcement often fails to act. The New York Times recently reported the story of a 19-year-old Alaskan woman raped in the remote fishing village of Emmonak.

After an intruder broke into her home and attacked her, she called the local tribal police and left a message on their voice mail.

No one ever returned her call. Her attacker remains in the village. The woman reportedly knew of five other women who had been raped by the same man, none of whom reported the crime.

Police can take the view that the prosecution of sexual crimes is too disruptive of community relations.

A culture of victim-blaming is rampant in tiny, remote villages where, if prosecuted, the perpetrators are likely to be sent to correctional institutions thousands of miles to the south. To many Arctic residents that feels like the 21st century equivalent of transportation.

In rural settlements across Alaska and Arctic Canada, violent crime against women is reaching crisis levels.

A 2010 poll of nearly 900 Alaskan women found that a shocking 37 per cent had experienced sexual violence.

According to a survey by the Federation of Natives reported in the New York Times, rates of sexual violence in the US’s largest state stand at 12 times the national average. Rape nearly four times.

74 per cent of victims responded to by Alaska State Troopers were under 18. The situation is so dire that it prompted Alaska Governor Sean Parnell to launch a state-wide initiative in December 2009 to halt what he called ‘the epidemic of domestic violence, sexual assault and child sexual abuse’ in the state.

Further east, the picture is the same. In the 53 isolated villages of the Arctic Canadian province of Nunavut violent crime has risen to nine times the national average.

Reports of domestic violence are six and a half times more common than in the south. The Inuit women’s group Pauktuutit reported that 52 per cent of women in Nunavut have suffered physical violence, and 27 per cent have been forced into sexual activity.

In this frozen, remote zone these statistics remain the tip of the iceberg. The Canadian government estimates that only 29 per cent of domestic abuse in Nunavut is ever reported.

A recent Canadian Department of Justice report notes: 'It is truly indeed a war zone in some households, with no protection for the most vulnerable.'

The isolation of most Arctic communities makes fear of reprisals a real issue in reporting abuse. Most victims of rape in the Arctic not only know their attackers, they are forced to live side by side with them.

Speaking to Canadian-based news network APTN, Suny Jacob of Qimaavik women’s shelter in Iqaluit, the Nunavut capital, insisted that 'people don’t want to report due to fear. They’re afraid of community members.'

Even if a woman does report a sexual assault, there’s very often no refuge or safe house to escape to. 

Only seven of the 53 communities in Nunavut have shelters. The nearest is often hundreds of miles away. There are no roads out.

In Arctic Canada, 15 per cent of homes don’t even have a phone. A plane ticket averages C$1000 (£500). As Associate Attorney General Tony West told the Washington Post, 'Where are you supposed to go? You have nowhere to go.'

The reasons for this epidemic of violence are complex. Economic deprivation, custom and the often bewildering speed of social change all play a part.

Native custom dictates that sexual violence is rarely talked about. As a result, abuse gets passed down between generations.

Overcrowding, homelessness, and resettlement have deprived men of their traditional roles. Arctic women are consistently out-performing men in education and employment, leading to resentment and, among the men, feelings of worthlessness and rage.

Soaring rates of alcohol and substance abuse don’t help. The RCMP informally estimates that alcohol is responsible for 95 per cent of all family violence.

In a part of the world where, according to a study by the University of Quebec, 25 per cent of young people in Nunavut have alcohol addiction issues, alcohol and drugs are often used as bait by transient outsiders eager to sexually exploit the vulnerable.

When a mine opened at Fort McMurray in Arctic Canada police reported an increase in sex crimes of 1400 per cent.

The sudden availability of drugs and moonshine, along with jealousies about jobs and money, led to a rise in domestic violence of 1200 per cent.

There are stories of young girls being trafficked to the south, or even sold by parents for as much as C$20,000. Right now, mines like that at Fort McMurray are opening weekly.

Across the Arctic, women are beginning to speak out, in rallies and village meetings but, in the land of ice, it will take a sea change before young women like Mackenzie Howard can feel even moderately safe or protected by the law.
