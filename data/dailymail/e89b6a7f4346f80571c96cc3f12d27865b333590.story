It's billed as the 'ultimate once-in-a-lifetime Valentine's Day experience' inside one of London's tallest buildings, and comes with an eye-watering £5,000 bill.

For those who can afford it, this expensive meal-for-two boasts exotic dishes and a bottle of vintage Champagne - all served by your very own private butler.

However, while the five-course bespoke menu served inside 20 Fenchurch Street - also known as the Walkie-Talkie due to its shape - is certainly not run-of-the-mill grub, it does include less exciting items such as artichoke soup, chicken wings and yogurt granola.

The dinner will be served in the private area of Fenchurch Seafood Bar & Grill, The Vinoly Room

The pre-dessert course of warm chocolate tart, glazed banana, honeycomb, peanut butter and gold leaf

The feast will be served on the 37th floor of the venue - affording diners a stunning view across the capital - in the private area of Fenchurch Seafood Bar & Grill, The Vinoly Room, which will be reserved just for two people.

And during the evening diners will be able to drink their way through two glasses of Champagne Ruinart Brut Rose, one bottle of Dom Perignon, one bottle of Chateau Gruaud-Larose 1997, and two glasses of Beres Tokaji.

The meal kicks off with an amuse bouche of truffled Jerusalem artichoke soup with girolles and smoked bacon brioche. 

For starters there is a choice of roasted veal sweetbreads morels, glazed chicken wing and sherry, or butter poached lobster, hand-rolled macaroni, duxelles (finely chopped mixture of mushrooms or mushroom stems, onions, shallots and herbs sauteed in butter) and Champagne sauce.  

For entrees, there is a choice of grilled turbot, whipped potato, oyster cream and caviar, or sirloin of Aberdeen Angus beef, glazed short rub, foie gras and truffled Madeira sauce.

Outstanding views: The £5,000 meal takes place on the 37th floor of 20 Fenchurch Street

Diners will be able to enjoy incredible views across London, including The Shard

This is accompanied by fine wine Chateau Gruaud-Larose 1997, 2eme Cru Classe, St Julien, Bordeaux, France. 

The menu also offers two desserts. First is warm chocolate tart, glazed banana, honeycomb, peanut butter and gold leaf while the main dessert is homemade yogurt granola served with a coffee and clementine marmalade, served with two glasses of Beres Tokaji 5 Puttonyos Aszu 2007.

But while the menu alone may not seem like it should warrant the £5,000 bill, the view (and private dining element) is what really bolsters the price of this romantic offering.

As the Walkie-Talkie is the fifth tallest building in the city, diners will be able - if it's a clear day - to feast while enjoying unprecedented views in the floor-to-ceiling-window restaurant - part of the building's Sky Garden - including The Shard and Tower Bridge. 

'The Vinoly Room provides an exclusive, utterly luxurious dining room. A dedicated butler serving a five-course menu of the highest quality ingredients, including lobster and turbot, alongside matched wines and champagnes, and what are arguably the best views in London this Valentine's Day, comes at a premium,' a spokesperson for Fenchurch Seafood Bar & Grill said to FEMAIL. 

This unique experience is ideal for anyone who wants to truly wow their loved one with an over-the-top, at-the-top gesture'.
