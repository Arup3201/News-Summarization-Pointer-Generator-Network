Sacking means something quite different for NFL coaches on the first day following the end of the regular season.

Five coaches have already been fired in a tradition known as Black Monday, as teams not progressing to the playoffs try to get a head start on next year.

The head coaches of the the Detroit Lions, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Washington Redskins, Minnesota Vikings, and Cleveland Browns have all been let go withing hours of the regular-season ending.

First to go: The Cleveland Browns got a head start on Black Monday by announcing the firing of head coach Rob Chudzinski late last night

Now unemployed: Minnesota Vikings head coach Leslie Frazier (left) and Washington Redskins head coach Mike Shanahan (right) were the first to be fired this morning as the NFL's struggling teams clear out

The dismissals started early this year, with the news that the Cleveland Browns would not be keeping coach Rob Chudzinski being released late last night.

As Monday morning dawned, two other coaches expected to be fired joined Chudzinksi on the unemployment line.

The Minnesota Vikings fired head coach Leslie Frazier and the Washington Redskins sacked head coach and Executive Vice President Mike Shanahan.

Shanahan was among those expected to be out of the job for the way he dealt with quarterback Robert Griffin III's ACL injury last season.

Bad move: Redskins head coach Mike Shanahan was expected to lose his job for the way he dealt with quarterback Robert Griffin III's leg injury. Above, Griffin aggravated his injury in a game against the Seattle Seahawks last year

Instead of letting Griffin recover from the injury, Shanahan put him back on the field after missing just one game. On January 6, the Redskins went up against the Seattle Seahawks in an NFL Wild Card game and Griffin aggravated the injury, having to undergo surgery three days later.

Griffin was back playing this season but the leg injury seems to have slowed him down noticeably.

By lunchtime in America, two other coaches had been fired: Greg Schiano of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Jim Schwartz of the Detroit Lions.

Surprising: Greg Schiano of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (left) and Jim Schwartz of the Detroit Lions (right) were also let go. Schiano's dismissal was unexpected since an NFL insider previously tweeted that his job was safe

Schiano's firing was unexpected as NFL insider Jay Glazer tweeted yesterday that the Tampa Bay coach was safe. Tampa Bay General Manager Mark Dominik was also let go.

While five firings may seem relatively tame, the dismissals have impacts far beyond one man since it means their assistant coaches are also out of the job.

But most won't be unemployed for long as they'll get snapped up by one of the other now head coach-less teams.

This quick turnover process helps the struggling teams get a fresh start on next year before the combine and draft.

'Everyone’s in such a competitive environment, there’s a race to get things done because there is the same group of candidates out there,' former Jets General Manager Mike Tannenbaum told the New York Times. 'It’s to clear the decks and move on.'

While it's not certain when Black Monday officially became apart of the NFL culture, the Times reports that it originated about 10 to 15 years ago around the time when sports channels switched to become 24 hour news sources.
