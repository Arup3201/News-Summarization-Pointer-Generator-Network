The story of controversial congressman Jesse Jackson Jr has become even stranger as his penchant for nude martial arts and the belief he's a reincarnated chariot driver have been revealed.

Jackson, 47, has rarely been seen in public since he took a leave of absence from Congress in June.

He faces an FBI criminal probe amid claims that he misused campaign funds to decorate his own home and he may be indicted before he comes up for re-election next month.

Strange behaviour: Ex-staffers claim Jesse Jackson Jr believed he was a chariot driver in a former life, and practiced martial arts while naked at a Turkish bath he frequented

But as Jackson comes under the microscope, former staffers are revealing some kooky behaviour exhibited by the Democrat.

Frank Coconate, a former Jackson aide who helped him explore the possibility of running for Chicago mayor in 2006, told the Washington Post: 'I really thought he had a problem with reality.

'He'd get in his own little world.'

Coconate, who is no longer on speaking terms with Jackson, told the paper that the congressman bragged that he had been a chariot driver in his former life.

Attorney and political adviser Frank Avila Jr added that Jackson would practice martial arts routines while naked at the Turkish bath he frequented.

Jackson, the son of civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson, was previously involved in an FBI investigation into attempts by governor Rod Blagojevich to sell Barack Obama's Senate seat after he was elected president 2008.

He took a medical leave of absence from his congressional duties on June 10 to combat depression.

He spent time at a clinic in Arizona, then moved to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, which issued a statement revealing that Jackson was being treated for bipolar disorder.

Although he returned to his Washington home last month, he has not been actively involved in his own re-election campaign.

His wife Sandi recently suggested that he would not return to work until after the election, depending on medical advice.

Yesterday,Â The Daily caught up with Jackson, who said he is 'not well' and sees doctors twice a day at a nearby hospital.

Health: The congressman is still on leave as he attempts to recover from depression

It was revealed on Sunday that a new investigation into Jackson is centered around allegations that the congressman used campaign funds to redecorate his home, according to insider sources.

Jackson's lawyer apparently asked officials from the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's office to guarantee that no charges would be filed before the election on November 6, but the authorities would not make that promise.

Jackson is almost certainly to be 
re-elected in the heavily Democratic district in south Chicago which he 
has represented for 17 years, despite his illness and the new campaign 
finance probe.

The congressman's spokesman refused to comment on the FBI investigation.

The
 overwhelming power of the Democratic Party in Chicago has led to 
multiple allegations of corruption levelled against local politicians 
over several decades.
