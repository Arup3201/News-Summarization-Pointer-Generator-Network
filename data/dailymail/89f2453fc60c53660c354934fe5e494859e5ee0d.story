Birmingham City Football Club owner Carson Yeung was jailed for six years today for laundering £55.4million following a high-profile trial that cast a spotlight on how the barber-turned-businessman made his fortune.

Yeung, 54, was found guilty by a Hong Kong court on Monday of five counts of money-laundering. He had denied the charges.

The businessman had told the court he amassed his wealth through hairdressing, share trading, property purchases, gambling in the world's casino hub of Macau and other investments.

The former hair stylist to Hong Kong's rich and famous laundered the money between January 2001 and December 2007 through five bank accounts, the court found.

After his trial earlier this 
month, judge Douglas Yau said he was 'self-contradictory' in his 
evidence and was 'making it up as he went along'.

'I find the defendant not a witness of truth,' Judge Yau told a packed court room. 'I find that he is someone who is prepared to, and did try to, lie whenever he saw the need to do so.'

The judge said he exaggerated the amount of profit made by his hair salon business.

The trial also revealed Yeung's close links to Macau's casino world, both as an investor and gambler, and how that enabled business investments that helped him amass his wealth.

He maintained that he built a fortune of hundreds of million of dollars through stock trading and business ventures in China.

But prosecutors said he was unable to show where £7.7million in his bank account had come from.

The Judge's verdict said there was reasonable doubt to believe that various business deals represented 'proceeds of an indictable offence.'

Yeung bought Birmingham in October 2009 for £81.5million from David Sullivan and David Gold, now the co-owners of West Ham.

He is still the majority shareholder but resigned last month as the club's president, director and director and chairman of the club's parent company, Birmingham International Holdings Ltd (BIHL) to await the verdict.

In a statement released at the time to the Hong Kong stock exchange, BIHL said: 'Mr Yeung, with his foresight, aspiration and clairvoyance, has steered the board successfully through landmark projects such as the acquisition of Birmingham City Football club, for which the board is profoundly indebted.

'Mr Yeung unequivocally confirms that he has no disagreement with the board and that there are no other matters relating to his resignation that are required to be brought to the attention of the shareholders of the company.'

Yeung's father and co-accused, Yeung Chung, died in 2012.
