Huge salaries and lavish expenses are allowing Members of the European Parliament to live like ‘latter-day Roman senators’, a report warned yesterday.

The shocking study found that cosseted MEPs now have incomes up to 20 times higher than the people they represent.

While millions of families across Europe have had their incomes squeezed, most MEPs have enjoyed large increases in their salaries –  while continuing to vote through ever-higher budgets for the EU.

MEPs in Brussels from the member nations earn £137million a year before allowances and expenses

The study found that MEPs now enjoy an average income of £182,826  including allowances for attendance and travel.

The figure is almost ten times higher 
than the average EU wage of £18,617 a year. It is also 695 per cent 
higher than the average UK salary of £23,000.

The biggest discrepancy is in 
Bulgaria, where the average wage is just £8,500 – less than a twentieth 
of the salary of an MEP.

Over a five-year term MEPs now have an income 
approaching £1million. The report, by the German website Preisvergleich.de, estimates it would take the average Bulgarian 108 
years to earn the same sum.

The European Union project has been rocked by a series of scandals

Unlike MPs in this country, MEPs still
 vote on their own salaries and perks. Until 2010 they received the same
 salary as an MP in their own country – equal to £65,738 in this 
country, but just £9,046 in Bulgaria.

But at that point they decided to ‘equalise’ salaries based on those of the best-paid countries, Germany and Italy.

The decision has led to most MEPs 
getting a huge boost in income at a time when their own citizens have 
been suffering as a result of the recession.

MEPs like Nigel Farage earn about 200 per cent more than Westminster MPs, according to the research

The report says the situation is 
reminiscent of ancient Rome, adding: ‘The survey results show the huge 
income disparities between the EU citizens battered by the economic 
crisis and their EU parliamentarians, concluding with one thesis only; 
we are dealing in Brussels and some national parliaments of the EU 
countries with conditions similar to ancient Rome, because just like in 
the former Roman Senate none of these “new class EU senators” are 
controlled in any way.

‘The extreme differences in pay structure between politicians and citizens are very serious.

‘There is at least as much need for 
discussion on this issue as on the EU’s plan to cap the manager salaries
 of public companies.’

The salaries and allowances of the 
MEPs of the 27 EU states now total £137million.

But this does not 
include the cost of the £217,000 office allowance available to each MEP.

The report also looks at some of the extraordinary perks available to MPs in some national parliaments.

In Italy, MPs are allowed to claim expenses for haircuts, while Maltese MPs get 240 litres of petrol a month.

The revelations will add to concern 
about the cost of the European Parliament, which maintains expensive 
legislatures in both Brussels and Strasbourg but still has relatively 
few real powers, except over the EU budget where it has repeatedly voted
 for above-inflation increases.
