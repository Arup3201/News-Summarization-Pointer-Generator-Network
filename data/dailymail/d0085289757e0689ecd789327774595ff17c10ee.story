A man who developed kidney failure after swimming in a dirty hotel pool has been given a new lease of life after his father donated one of his organs.

Aidan Sheikh-Husseyin, 23, from Ringwood, Dorset, was on holiday in Turkey three years ago when he picked up E. coli from a swimming pool.

The infection is thought to have led to him developing kidney failure and left him in desperate need of a transplant.

Aidan Sheikh-Husseyin, 23, has been saved by his father, Ilkay Husseyin, 46, who gave him a new kidney

He is now recovering after his father, Ilkay Husseyin, gave him a new kidney.

Mr Sheikh-Husseyin, who was diagnosed with kidney failure last year, said: ‘I was at college one day and was playing football when I started to lose colour, feel faint, my heart rate increased and I had swelling in my legs.

‘I went to the doctor who initially thought there could be a problem with my heart.

‘Nothing progressed from that and I felt OK, so I quickly moved on, until one day my girlfriend, Abi, made a comment about the appearance of my urine.

‘Together we looked on the internet at what bubbles in urine means and there was a suggestion of kidney failure.

‘Under Abi’s instruction I went to see my GP later that week with a urine sample, and that same day the GP referred me to Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth and said I needed a biopsy immediately.’

Mr Husseyin was found to be a suitable kidney donor for his son after six months of tests

A biopsy revealed Mr Sheikh-Husseyin had severe renal failure and doctors advised he needed a kidney transplant within a year or he would need dialysis.

About 10 per cent of people who suffer from E. coli go on to develop a life-threatening complication called Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome.

This is one of the most common causes of acute kidney failure in infants and young children and can also cause kidney problems in adults.

E. coli multiplies in the intestines and bind to the cells that line it.

It's presence allows for the absorption of toxins into the blood which transports it to the kidneys.

This causes injury to the kidneys resulting in kidney failure.

If this happens, patients can require a transplant or dialysis.

His cousin and his father were immediately tested and both were matches for a kidney transplant.

It was decided that Mr Husseyin would donate and the father and son underwent successful surgery three weeks ago.

Father-of-one Mr Sheikh-Husseyin, a graduate at digital print agency, said: ‘We decided that my dad would be the donor as thinking strategically my cousin was much younger, therefore should I need a transplant in the future I could lean on him, and the opportunity might not be there with my dad in 20 or so years.

‘I was in my final year of university while dad was undergoing the tests and my girlfriend had just had our first born, Reilly.

‘My energy levels were noticeably deteriorating which was affecting my concentration at university and at home, so it was a stressful time.

‘The past 
few years have been a bit of a whirlwind, but I’m looking forward to 
starting my new position in September and carving a career for both 
myself and my new family.

‘Print
 and photography are a huge passion for me so I cannot thank my dad 
enough for giving me the opportunity to be able to lead a normal life 
with Abi, Reilly and my career.’

I.T
 consultant and martial arts instructor Mr Husseyin, 46, from Southgate,
 London, said: ‘I was well-prepared for the tests that I had to undergo 
in order to qualify for the donation.

‘Emotionally the process to be a candidate for kidney donation is like a roller-coaster ride where at every stage you have to undergo tests, and then wait for the results before you progress to the next stage.

‘Only one person can complete the process at one time so it was a constant worry that I may fail a stage at some point throughout the six-month period, and we would have wasted the one year clock the doctor gave Aidan to have his transplant in.’

Surgeon Sam Dutta is pleased with the outcome of the operation and hopes this transplant will help to promote organ donation amongst ethnic minority groups.
