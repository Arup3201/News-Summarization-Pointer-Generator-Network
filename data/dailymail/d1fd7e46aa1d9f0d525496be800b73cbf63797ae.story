A 23-year-old Indiana man was killed just hours before his first child was born, when an off-duty police officer reportedly under the influence of prescription drugs crashed into his car.

Jesse Sperry's 9-months-pregnant wife Rebecca was driving them home from church around 12:30pm Sunday when 41-year-old Edgewood police officer James Foutch rear-ended their Buick with his SUV.

The collision forced the Sperry's car off the road and into a utility pole, snapping the pole in half. 

Tragically, the Sperrys were just 
hours away from becoming new parents together as 22-year-old Rebecca was
 set to undergo an induced labor later that evening.

Mr Sperry was pronounced dead at the scene while his seriously-injured wife was airlifted to St Vincent Hospital in Indianapolis to undergo an emergency C-section.

According to a fundraising page set up by the couple's family, Mrs Sperry gave birth to daughter Autumn who was then taken to Riley Hospital for special treatment.

Lauren Schneider, a friend of Mrs Sperry's family, told MailOnline that both mother and daughter seem to be in stable condition.

Ms Schneider visited Autumn at Riley Children's Hospital today and says the newborn is 'doing better', going through treatment and set to take another round of medical tests in a few days. So far, they haven't been informed of any thing life threatening. Mrs Sperry was in stable condition at St Vincent's the last she heard.

'We're just asking people to go to the fundraising page and donate and if they can't just to be praying because the family has a really long road ahead of them from hear on out,' Ms Schneider told MailOnline.

Wayne Pinkerton lives near the crash site, and came out to help the injured couple when he heard the collision.

Young love: According to pictures posted on Mrs Sperry's Facebook, the two were married in June 2012

'It was pretty clear, immediately, that the man wasn't going to make it,' Mr Pinkerton said of Mr Sperry in the Herald Bulletin. 'The woman was very pregnant, but she was awake and conscious and alert. I know they lifelined her out.'

Officer Foutch was uninjured in the crash, but his 24-year-old girlfriend Erica Manis was taken to the hospital for non life-threatening injuries. 

After the crash, Foutch was also 
taken to the hospital to have his blood drawn and was later arrested for
 an operating while intoxicated charge, a Class B felony.

Foutch was held at the Madison County Detention Center, but later released after posting $20,000 bond.

Investigators
 believe Foutch had prescription pills in his system at the time of the 
crash, but wouldn't elaborate on the specific drugs.He was a 12-year veteran of the police department.

According to Mrs Sperry's Facebook page, the couple were married in June 2012.
