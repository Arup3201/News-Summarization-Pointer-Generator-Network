In a move that is no doubt set to excite Harry Potter fans across the country, Daniel Radcliffe has taken his Melbourne home off the market.

The exclusive property at 98B St Georges Road in Toorak, was listed as for sale in February and was expected to fetch around $2.5 million.

However despite it receiving plenty of interest,  the star appears to have changed his mind, fuelling rumours of a temporary return to Australian shores, according to the Herald Sun.

Harry Potter actor Daniel Radcliffe has taken his penthouse apartment in Toorak, Melbourne off the market

The three-bedroom apartment on Georges Street was bought by his parents for $1.8 million in 2006

The 25-year-old Englishman had the property bought for him 10 years ago in 2006 for the filming of Rod Harvy's December Boys, in which the then-16-year-old actor played an Australian orphan.

It was purchased for $1.8 million by Radcliffe's parents Alan Radcliffe, a casting agent, and BBC casting director Marcia Gresham.

Radcliffe shot to fame at 11 years old when he was cast as the eponymous Harry Potter in the Warner Brothers film franchise, and is reported to have property in New York and London, as well as Melbourne.

The three-bedroom property was transferred to the Kill Your Darlings actor in 2007 when he turned 18, and was made use of by family and friends when Radcliffe was occupied with projects overseas, reported Domain. 

Marshall White's Marcus Chiminello previously told Daily Mail Australia that despite loving the privacy the apartment offered, Radcliffe has found himself visiting Australia less frequently than in previous years and had decided to put the much-loved apartment up for sale.

'He's based himself full-time in New York and has sadly decided to move on,' said Mr Chiminello,

He added that Radcliffe was a big fan of the large living area which entailed almost half of the apartment and  made the residence an ideal place for entertaining friends and family.

The north facing St Georges Road apartment is spectacular in it's own right, winning the Victorian Apartment Project of the Year and nestled on one of Toorak's most exclusive streets. 

The suburb has the highest average property values in Melbourne, and is home to other well-known Australians including media personality Eddie McGuire, former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser and footballer Nathan Buckley. 

Estate agent Marcus Chiminello said that Radcliffe had made himself a permanent home in New York

The Toorak residence is one of only two penthouse-style apartments in the development, and is elevated to provide exposure to sunlight and offer privacy.

The apartment occupies the entire top level, and overlooks Melbourne's CBD and the Yarra River, located just five kilometres away in Melbourne's most expensive suburb.

Developed by prestige builder Stonehenge, it is accessed by a private lift and features timber floors, floor-to-ceiling windows and opens onto a rooftop terrace.

Mr Chiminello said that the agency had had  significant interest from Harry Potter enthusiasts

The estate agent previously said that he was intrigued to see whether a fan would purchase the apartment 

The kitchen is fully equipped with Miele appliances and also boasts a butler's pantry and laundry, and a walk-in pantry to aid entertaining.

The apartment houses three bedrooms, and the main features a built-in wardrobe, a walk-in wardrobe, and a grand ensuite.

Radcliffe's parents reportedly bought the apartment after seeing photographs of it online, out of a love for Australia.

'Someone my dad went to drama school with lives here [Melbourne]. We just got on with the place really, really well and so we just love it here,' Radcliffe told The Herald Sun in 2007.
