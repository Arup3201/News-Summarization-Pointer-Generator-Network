Confusing: The sign which has led Westminster Council to pay back more than 5,000 parking fines

A council which dished out parking fines worth up to £665,000 to 'confused' drivers for more than two years has agreed to pay them back.

Westminster City Council issued 5,121 fines at an eye-watering £130 each to people parked in special 'dual use' bays, which became taxi ranks overnight.

But it was claimed some drivers had no idea they had done anything wrong - because they had to examine two different signs to work out the rules.

The move is the latest in a series of mass refunds by councils, some of which admitted their signs did not comply with the law.

Last year Hertfordshire County Council bowed to local pressure and paid back 35,000 fines, worth more than £1 million, to motorists who had driven into a bus lane in Hemel Hempstead.

The year before, about 20,000 fines handed out by controversial 'spy cars' mounted with CCTV - which punish drivers parking on double yellow lines or next to school gates - were repaid in the London Borough of Richmond because a parking crusader discovered they were not properly certificated.

And earlier this year, it was claimed more than 300,000 fines issued in bays suspended for building work were invalid, because councils had not obtained formal permission from the Department for Transport.

Communities secretary Eric Pickles has ramped up a campaign against over-zealous parking measures. In September he said CCTV cars were 'illegal' and should be scrapped.

And he said in August: ‘Anti-car measures are driving motorists into the arms of internet retailers and out-of-town superstores. Trying to find somewhere to park is an obstacle course in too many of our towns, cities and seaside resorts.’

The parking spaces which have been awarded the refund were in affluent central London.

Jermyn Street is home to the upmarket department store Fortnum & Mason, while Conduit Street, Mayfair, is the base for fashion designer Vivienne Westwood.

Fines were also handed out in Oxendon Street, two roads from the capital's Leicester Square.

The parking tickets were handed out from May 2011 until a few days ago, when the signs were corrected.

A Westminster Council spokesman said it expected the total value of the 5,121 fines would come to £278,000.

If all the tickets were paid at the full rate of £130, they would have come to £665,000. Fines reduce to £65 if paid within a fortnight.

But the amount expected to be paid back is less - because many of those appealing will need to contact the council individually.

Drivers will need to prove they paid to park, either with their original reference number or with proof of payment. That means anyone who paid with cash may be out of luck.

The spokesman said: 'The council will get in touch with anyone whose contact details they have. Anyone else who paid a fine should give what information they have and the council will try and find their ticket and payment on the system.'

The spokesman added: 'There are many circumstances in which it is claimed that Penalty Charge Notices (PCNs) issued by the council were wrongly issued or are invalid.

'It is not the council’s normal policy to make refunds of PCNs once they have been paid, since there is a statutory mechanism for challenging and appealing against PCNs.

'The circumstances in which PCNs were issued in dual use bays are regarded by the council as so special as to justify an exception to its normal policy.'

It is not the first time Westminster's parking regime has made headlines.

In September its traffic wardens were revealed to be the most fine-happy in the country, handing out 1,269 penalties a day, according to figures obtained by the insurance firm LV=.

Cabinet member for parking Cllr Nickie Aiken said: 'Dual-use bays are all about maximising the space at the kerbside in the city to enable fair and easy parking for everyone.

'However, we accept that the parking signs in these streets could have given rise to confusion among motorists and so we are making a one-off exception – it is the right thing to do. We have now also replaced signs as a result.'
