Across Britain, campaigners have been battling with local authorities to prevent the closure of their cherished libraries faced with Government cuts.

But one English town has found itself in a unique position - with locals battling against the opening of a new £2million library.

Residents in Glossop, Derbyshire, have argued that an existing library, housed in a 19th century gothic revival hall should remain, despite being in need of major renovation.

Conflict: Derbyshire County Council has proposed the building of a new library 'that is fit for the 21st century' in Glossop. But a campaign group wants the existing library in Victoria Hall (pictured) to remain

The affinity displayed by some locals for Victoria Hall has prompted a complicated debate over the future of public reading in the town.

The ground floor of Victoria Hall, constructed in 1888, is leased to Derbyshire county council for free by High Peak borough council, which is its trustee.

The county council plans to build a new library offering 'new, enhanced and extended services' on the site, which was previously a primary school and currently serves as a county council social services building.

The proposed build, which includes 'ancillary accommodation' and 'garden space', will be considered by the council's planning committee on Monday.

Campaign group Glossop Soul (Save
Our Unique Library) said that it will take a favourable planning decision to judicial review, claiming that 97 per cent of 1,000 residents questioned were opposed to the plans.

The group has expressed concern that the hall will fall into disrepair if the library is removed and queries whether it would cost as much to repair as has been mooted.

The listed building is in desperate need of renovation and the county council argues that any proposed redevelopment of it would be limited by a covenant.

Having been built on land donated by 2nd Lord Howard of Glossop, he stipulated that it should only be used for 'the purpose of the erection of a public free library and public hall thereon'.

The borough council, controlled by Labour, has offered to transfer ownership of the hall to the Conservative-run county council, hoping that it will spend the £2million pot on the existing library.

But the county council's leader 
Andrew Lewer said he wanted to 'provide the best possible library'.

He said: 'I find it deeply disappointing that party 
politics ahead of a tense county council election has led to efforts to 
portray the building of a new library in Glossop as somehow bad news.'

Denying that council was planning the move without adequate consultation, he told the Guardian: 'Elsewhere in the country libraries are closing and here we are making this exciting and forward-looking investment.

'The county council wants to provide 
the best possible library, the borough council would like to unload one 
of the large number of expensive 19th-century buildings it owns that are
underused and costly.

'Saving Victoria Hall and saving – or
rather improving – Glossop library are both worthwhile but it does not 
follow that they are one and the same thing.'

A spokesman for Derbyshire County Council said: 'The current building – Victoria Hall – is just not suitable for a 21st century library. The plans we have are for a much bigger, lighter, brighter library for the town giving space for more books and computers for public use.

'We only occupy one of three floors of Victoria Hall and this floor needs around £500,000 of essential repairs.

'This would not improve the service we provide or refurbish the top floor which is currently empty, or the basement which is used by a local youth group.

'There is a restrictive covenant on the building that would prevent us from using the other floors in a way that would meet our accommodation requirements in Glossop.'
