Three million motorists  face being caught on camera and fined as Britain’s busiest toll road dispenses with traditional toll-booths.

From the end of this month, the Dartford crossing over the M25 – used by up to 50 million vehicles a year at a rate of up to 170,000 a day - will operate a ‘free flow’ system without barriers. 

Instead of handing over the fee in case, motorists must pay online or by phone before they use the crossing or on an electronic system - similar to that used for the London Congestion Charge - after.

Three million motorists face being caught on camera and fined as Britain’s busiest toll road - the Dartford crossing - starts asking drivers to pay the toll fee online or over the phone 

Vehicles passing north through the two tolled tunnels – or south across the Queen Elizabeth Bridge – will have their number plates filmed by up to 18 ‘ANPR’ cameras which will police the system.

If a car driver fails in time to pay the new £2.50 toll – up 50p the current cost of £2.00– he or she will be fined automatically up to £105.

Failure to pay online or by phone by midnight of the following day will, when ‘free-flow’ goes live, result in a penalty charge of £35 if paid within 14 days, £70 up to 28 days and £105 thereafter.

Up to one in 14  of vehicles using the crossing are expected not to pay, according to an impact assessment carried out last year.

The AA fears many unwitting drivers will be caught out, especially if they are only occasional users.

Mistakes on the ANPR number plate recognition system could also mean many drivers unfairly penalised.

The tolled crossing is used by millions of families from across Britain as they head on holiday or to the Continent.

But a recent AA poll showed that 85 per cent of members were unaware that they will have to pay by phone or online.

Even locally, 16per cent of drivers directly affected by the new charging system are unaware of it.

French company Sanef has a 10-year contract worth up to £367million to run the system for the Government, which retains ownership of the tolled crossing across the Thames which opened originally in 1991.

The Highways Agency says all profits from tolling will go to the Treasury but must, by law, be spent on transport-related projects.

However the AA says motorists are furious because the cost of the tolled crossing was paid off by motorists in 2003.

The toll continued because the Government said a continued charge was necessary to ‘restrict demand’ for it.

The Highways Agency says, of the 50million vehicles using the crossing each year, 43 million will be within the 6am to 10pm charging period.

With up to 7 per cent of these likely to be fined, that means around 3 million a year face a ticket.

The Highways Agency says changes in the way payments are made will come into effect on Sunday November 30 – just as the new higher charges come into effect. 

AA head of roads policy Paul Watters said: ‘Our worry is that this will all end in chaos. Motorists will be very annoyed.

‘They may welcome less congestion and queuing, but they won’t be happy if a penalty charge notice drops through their letterbox because they forgot to pay the one time they used it.’

He said: ‘We’ve had lots of calls from members who are very concerned. We’ve had people who want to book ahead now for the first day of operation, but say they can’t unless they sign up for the pre-pay system.’ 

Highways Agency project manager Nigel Gray said: ‘Dart Charge will help speed up journeys so it’s great news for the tens of thousands of drivers who use the crossing every day and for the economy.’
