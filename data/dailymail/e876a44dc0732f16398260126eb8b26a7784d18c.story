Scalpers are cashing in on the prodigious demand for the new iPhone 6 by selling their pre-ordered handsets for exponential prices.

Pre orders for the new devices opened in Australia last Friday, causing the Apple page to crash under the pressure.

Since then, there has been a spate of ads on sites like eBay, offering pre ordered iPhone's at exorbitant prices.

The iPhone six plus, offered on an eBay ad for $2,999-over $1,600 more than the pre order price

One eBay seller advertised a 64GB iPhone 6 Plus for $2,999. The same  model is advertised at Apple's official online store for $1129.

There is little in place to police online scalping, as Apple can only control the prices inside retailers. 

Tom Godfrey, the head of media at consumer affairs group Choice, warned people to reconsider about paying top dollar for the newest Apple models.

'My understanding is that Apple has done a synchronised release, so our advice is it's better to wait,' Mr Godfrey told Sydney Morning Herald .

'Apart from the fact that you're going to pay a high price, we also know that first-generation phones often come with a lot of bugs. So paying a premium for a buggy phone is not a great idea.'

The new handsets are priced between $869 for the smaller basic model to the top-of-the-range model at $1249

Mr Godfrey advised consumers to consider some competitive products before they decide to get the newest Apple product.

'The Samsung Galaxy S5 or HTC One M8 are both great competitors to Apple and will come with a lot less bugs and a much smaller price tag,' Mr Godfrey said.

The newest iPhones come in the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus – available in three different finishes and three different storage capacities (16GB, 64GB and 128GB).

The new handsets are priced between $869 for the basic model to the top-of-the-range larger model at $1249.
