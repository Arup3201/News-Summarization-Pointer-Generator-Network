A hairdresser whose supporters helped raise more than £1million for charity after her death in this year’s London Marathon was buried next to her brother in her home town today.

Claire Squires was laid to rest in the same grave as her brother at a private burial service at St Andrew’s Church in North Kilworth, Leicestershire at 9am attended by some family members, her partner Simon Van Herrewege and hundreds of other mourners.

Her brother Grant died at the age of 25 from a drug overdose in 2001. She had planned to run the race to raise cash in his honour.

Members of the congregation arriving 
for the service, which began at noon, wore splashes of 
red, Miss Squires’s favourite colour, at the request of her family.

Miss Squires’s parents Priscilla, 
known as Cilla, and Paul were not present at the burial but were 
attending the funeral service afterwards with her sisters Maxine, Nicola
and Penny.

More than 600 family and friends are thought to have arrived so far.

Some 200 people packed into the church, which can seat 150, while more than 400 stood on the grass outside.

The mourners were also handed red bands with XXX Claire XXX on to wear in return for donations to the charity Rainbows.

The Rev Emma Davies thanked the hundreds
of people attending and said: 'We gather to remember Claire and to give
great thanks to Claire who gave so much to so many people.

She described Claire as a 'truly beautiful' person who 'sparkled'.

The congregation then sang All Things Bright And Beautiful, the first of two hymns which have been chosen by the family.

Local Baptist minister Pastor Johnny Hutton, a family friend, led the service.

He said: 'Many people have said that Claire was so much like that Samaritan who was prepared to help someone regardless of who they were or where they came from.

'Claire’s life has inspired others to do the same and her tragic death has caught people’s attention so that she has left this amazing legacy.

One of the many heartfelt tributes for 'Claire Bear'

'Those who have donated should also 
be commended for their giving. I know the family have been moved by the 
generosity of so many, particularly from children and those who could 
ill afford to give.

'Claire’s life and it seems untimely 
death will long be remembered by many more than just family and friends 
because of this unprecedented response.'

The congregation sobbed, laughed and applauded as friends and family paid tribute to Miss Squires.

Her youngest sister, Penny, tearfully paid tribute, describing her as 'beautiful, inside and out'.

She said her sister lived 'life to the full' and was a 'go-getter'.

'She has left a huge legacy raising well over a million pounds. She has become the nation's sweetheart,' she added.

Mr Van Herrewege also struggled to read out his tribute.

He thanked family and friends for all their support as well as people who had donated from across the world.

'There has been overwhelming support from people across the UK and the world who have taken her into their heart,' he said.

He added that the level of generosity had been 'mind-blowing'.

He said her legacy would make life 'better for other people, just like she did ours'.

Applause could be heard inside and 
outside the church as the congregation joined in the Lord's Prayer, 
bringing the 45-minute service to an end.

Speaking on behalf of the family afterwards, Catherine Johnstone, chief executive of the Samaritans, said: 'This is a very difficult time for everyone here.

'The funeral service was beautiful and very touching and all the family and friends here today are testament to the wonderful woman that Claire was.

'Her family and friends are all incredibly proud of Claire, a person who always put other people before herself. We would like to say thank you, and a heartfelt thank you, to the thousands of people who have kindly donated in Claire's memory.

It was revealed yesterday that Miss Squires suffered from an 'irregular heartbeat' but refused to let it stop her running

'During this difficult time, Claire's family have found both warmth and comfort from the incredibly supportive reaction from the general population and the nation at large.

'Cilla, Claire's mum, had been a volunteer for the Samaritans, and still is, and has been there for 24 years, decades of time with us helping those who have nowhere else to turn.

'Through the donations to the Samaritans, Claire's legacy will live on and we are asking you to respect the family's privacy now while we spend some time thinking about how we can maximise that legacy and how that legacy can live on in Claire's name.

'Chad Varah who set Samaritans up nearly 60 years ago said the Samaritans was all about ordinary people doing extraordinary things. I think today, and the last ten days, bear witness to just how extraordinary Claire was and she will be sadly missed by everybody, but hugely remembered.'

Miss
Squires collapsed and died less than a mile from the finishing line of 
the 26.2-mile course on Birdcage Walk near Buckingham Palace on April 
22.

The 30-year-old was running for the 
Samaritans, in recognition of the work done by her mother Cilla, who had
volunteered for the charity for 24 years.

Floral tributes were left on the path leading up to the church.

One read: 'Bear, we love and miss you 
so much. God must have needed an extra special person to have taken you.
You’re now with Grant so look after each other.'

Another bouquet with a pair of gold 
plastic scissors attached was from the Moko hair salon in Market 
Harborough where she worked.

A record, Running by Alan Braxe and 
Fred, was also left. The message said: 'Your fav request. This will 
always remind me of you. Spencer.'

A gold plaque has also been placed in the churchyard with her name engraved on it.

Dolly Parton’s song Nine To Five and Toploader’s Dancing In The Moonlight were played on a PA system set up outside the church.

Donations to Miss Squires’s JustGiving website jumped from £500 to more than £1million in the week following her death.

Celebrities and businessmen including
Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson, Dragons' Den star Peter Jones and 
singer Alesha Dixon have all contributed.

It was revealed yesterday that Miss Squires suffered from an 'irregular heartbeat' but refused to let it stop her running.

Tests are being carried out to see if the heart condition contributed to her sudden death during the marathon.

'Claire had been diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat,' a friend said.

'It didn't stop her keeping fit. It might have made a lesser person take a back seat. But Claire just got on with it.'

Mr Van Herrewege told how he was waiting for Miss Squires at the finish line when he received a call from a nurse on his mobile telling him to get to the hospital because she was 'very poorly.'

He dashed over with Penny, thinking Miss Squires had simply sprained her ankle, but on arrival they were told she had died.

Mr Van Herrewege, 31, a health and social carer for a nursing home company, said: 'She was lying there and then all we could do was hug and kiss her. She looked so beautiful. There was not a mark on her.'

He described Miss Squires as 'the most incredible girl' and said they had been out for a meal the night before the race with a friend and she had seemed 'absolutely fine.'

Her father revealed at the weekend how his daughter's birth was as memorable as her death.

'When she was born, I had to deliver her in the car on the way to hospital. Now we have this. She came in with a bang and went out with one,' said the 62-year-old.
