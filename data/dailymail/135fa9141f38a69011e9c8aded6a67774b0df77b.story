Silvio Berlusconi has been ordered to perform community service at an old people's home at least one day a week as part of his one-year sentence for tax fraud.

The former Italian Prime Minister, 77, has already had his passport confiscated as part of a travel ban which means his is forbidden from leaving the Lombardy region where he has his principal residence.

It means he is unable to visit his properties in the Alps and the Caribbean and may prevent him from campaigning for his Forza Italia party ahead of European Parliament elections next month.

An earlier request to leave Italy to go to a meeting of the anti-Europeans parties in Holland was refused last month.

It is the latest in a series of embarrassing blows for Berlusconi who was kicked out of Parliament last year after the high court upheld his conviction and four-year prison sentence.

The three-times former premier won't do any jail time for the tax fraud conviction, which concerned the purchase of TV rights to U.S. films for Berlusconi's Mediaset network.

The term has been reduced to one year under an amnesty, and Berlusconi will serve it either under house arrest or doing community service.

Despite the ban on holding or running
 for public office, Berlusconi remains a force in Italian politics, 
heading his Forza Italia party.
