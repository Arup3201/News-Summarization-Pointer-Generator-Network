Both the men's and women's singles champions at the 2014 US Open will earn £1.8million for their efforts - the highest in the tournament's history.

The bumper payouts, announced by the United States Tennis Association (USTA), are being offered from an increased total prize fund of £22.4m.

That is a rise of £2.4m, or 11.7 per cent, on last year's tournament, which is played annually at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Centre in New York City.

Money: 2014 US Open winners will get a £1.8million prize from a total pot of £22.4m

Winners: Serena Williams (pictured) and Rafael Nadal won the 2013 women's and men's titles respectively

The 2014 tournament takes place between August 25 and September 8.

Dave Haggerty, USTA chairman of the board and president, said: 'Last year to recognize the importance of the players and the key role they have in building our sport, the USTA shared our vision to reach $50m (£30m) in prize money at the US Open by 2017.

'This year's prize money increase continues the commitment to make the US Open one of the most lucrative purses in all of sports.'

Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams won the men's and women's singles titles in 2013 respectively.
