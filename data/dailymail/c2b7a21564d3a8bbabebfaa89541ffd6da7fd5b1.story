A wannabe robber tried to pry open a drive-through ATM using a stolen forklift

The 10,000-pound industrial forklift was stolen from a nearby construction site early Monday and driven a half mile to Synovus Bank

Although the machine was smashed, the actual forklift remained intact and with very little damage.

No suspect information has been made available.

An officer on scene was seen dusting a large industrial sized truck for fingerprints. 

The ATM was later wrapped with police tape, but remained in its same location.

No cash was stolen during the attempted robbery. 

The thief tried to double down, piercing the bulky ATM machine with twin forks

Despite visible damage to the ATM, it wouldn't budge and held as firm as any bank vault and the wannabe robber walked away empty-handed

The thief left the forklift embedded in the ATM machine and ran off

Police were alerted to the botched theft by a bank employee at 7 a.m. and have been combing the area for fingerprints
