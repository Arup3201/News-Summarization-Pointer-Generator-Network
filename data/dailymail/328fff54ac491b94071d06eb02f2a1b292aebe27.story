The former nursing student accused of killing seven people in a gun rampage at a Christian College in Oakland last April has been deemed by a judge today to be mentally unfit to stand trial for his crimes.

The ruling by Alameda County Superior Court Judge Carrie Panetta came after two doctors who evaluated One Goh, 44, determined that he suffers from paranoid schizophrenia.

However, Panetta did leave the door open for a criminal trial for Goh after stating that if he is judged to have regained his mental competency he will stand trial for seven counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder following his April 2nd shooting spree at Oikos University.

The shootings were the deadliest at an American college since 2007, when a Virginia Tech University student killed 32 people and wounded 25.

A public defender representing defendant One Goh said a psychiatrist has determined that Goh suffers from paranoid schizophrenia that dates back several years.

Alameda County Assistant Public Defender David Klaus has said the condition causes Goh to distrust people, including those trying to help him.

Klaus has said he and his co-counsel have had trouble talking with Goh because of his mental state.

Authorities have said Goh, a former Oikos student, planned the killing spree at the school that caters to Korean immigrants after becoming angry with school officials over a tuition dispute. He previously decided to drop out of the school's nursing program.

Goh, a Korean national is currently being held in custody without bail and is also facing 10 so called special-circumstance allegations, including committing murder during a carjacking.

Police in Oakland said that Goh fled the campus after the April 2nd shootings after stealing a car that belonged to one of the victims.

He was arrested in Alameda after he confessed to a supermarker security guard that he had just shot several people.

Police said that one theory they are examining for the shooting is that he wanted a refund of his tuition and may have targeted an administrator who was not present on the day of the shooting.

Ellen Cervellon said alleged shooter One Goh, 43, dropped out of the nursing program at Oikos University in November but had returned to the Oakland campus several times to demand a full tuition refund from her.

Ms Cervellon said Goh was furious when she told him that the school could not refund all his money because he had been enrolled for nearly half of the program.

When Goh was told the woman was not on at the college, he began shooting indiscriminately in classrooms.

He killed six students and a school receptionist while wounding three others.

The coroner's office named the
victims as Judith Seymour, 53, of San Jose; Lydia Sim, 21, of Hayward 
and 33-year-old Sonam Chodon of El Cerrito.

Grace Kim, 23, of Union City; Doris 
Chibuko, 40, of San Leandro and male victim Tshering Rinzing Bhutia, 38,
of San Francisco, also died.

School secretary Katleen Ping, 24, was also shot dead at the Oakland school.

In talking to several of the students 
and faculty who were there, I think he was looking for me. I have that 
weight on my shoulders and I don't know what to do with it.

Ms Cervellon said: 'In talking to several of the students and faculty who were there, I think he was looking for me.

'I have that weight on my shoulders and I don't know what to do with it.

'Every single one of those students were going to be an excellent, excellent nurse. They're in my heart and they always will be.'

Oakland Police Chief Howard Jordan told 
reporters at the time that Goh was angry after being expelled from the 
school, but Ms Cervellon said he was never expelled and decided to leave
on his own.

Victim: Grace Eunhae Kim, 23, was killed in the shooting at the Christian college in Oakland, California

She said: 'He was never forced out, he showed no behavioral problems, and he was never asked to leave the program.

'He decided on his own to leave the program.'

Prosecutors charged Goh with seven counts of murder the day after the massacre at the college.

The 43-year-old was also charged with three counts of attempted murder.

He also faced a special circumstance allegation of multiple murders that could make him eligible for the death penalty.

Goh surrendered to authorities an hour after the attack at Oikos University that left seven dead and three others wounded.

Police said in court documents that Goh admitted to bringing a .45-caliber handgun to Oikos along with four magazines of ammunition. The documents said he acknowledged shooting several people before fleeing.
