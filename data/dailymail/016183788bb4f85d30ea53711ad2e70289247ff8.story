Labour and the Liberal Democrats have quietly aligned policy pledges in more than a dozen areas, prompting speculation that they are preparing the ground for a coalition after next year’s general election.

Ed Miliband’s decision this week to effectively rule out a referendum on the EU if he becomes prime minister was the latest in a series of moves which bring the two parties more closely into line.

While Tory strategists admit they struggle to envisage reaching agreement on plans for another five years of power-sharing with the Lib Dems, Labour now agrees with Nick Clegg’s party on a broad range of issues.

An analysis by the New Statesman identifies 14 areas where Labour and the Lib Dems have converged, including cutting pensioner benefits, reducing the voting age to 16 and a mansion tax on expensive homes.

Others are preserving the Human Rights Act, introducing new green energy targets and restricting the ability of free schools to hire  whoever they want.

Senior Labour figures are split over whether to prepare for the possibility of a pact – something Gordon Brown’s government failed to do in 2010, making it easier for the Lib Dems to reach an agreement with the Conservatives.

Lord Adonis, the shadow minister for infrastructure, has called publicly for the party to start planning for a deal, but Harriet Harman, the deputy leader, has dismissed such calls, suggesting it could prevent some Lib Dem voters  from switching to Labour.

Some of those closest to Mr Miliband are also urging him to attempt a minority government if Labour is the largest party but falls short of a Commons majority next year, rather than entering a coalition with the Lib Dems.

However, the increasing overlap between the two parties’ policies has prompted suspicions  in Tory ranks that they are increasingly contemplating a power-sharing pact.

This week, the Labour leader announced he would only support an EU referendum following any new transfer of powers from Britain to Brussels, something no one is contemplating and effectively ruling it out – a stance identical to that of the Lib Dems.

‘After thrashing about for months on what to do about an EU referendum, Miliband happens to settle on what’s already Lib Dem policy,’ said one senior Conservative.

‘They’re suddenly agreeing too on mansion taxes and all sorts of other things. It’s fairly obvious what is going on.’

However, there are doubts over whether Mr Clegg could credibly play a role in a Lib-Lab coalition.  Some senior Labour figures  suggest they would seek the departure of the Deputy Prime Minister as the price of a deal.

The Lib Dems insisted Mr Brown would have to quit when they discussed the possibility of a Lib-Lab deal in 2010.

Mr Clegg, standing in for David Cameron at Prime Minister’s Questions this week, clashed angrily with Labour MPs over a range of issues.

He berated Labour for making ‘sweetheart deals with the private sector’ in the NHS and for presiding over the Mid-Staffs hospital scandal, and for ‘sucking up’ to bankers. Labour MPs, meanwhile, attacked him as a ‘lap dog’ of the Conservatives.

The Deputy Prime Minister insisted yesterday that Labour’s backing for the Lib Dem position on an in/out EU referendum did not have ‘any bearing’ on a potential coalition deal.

‘Labour have had different positions [on a referendum], and have now said they believe something we’ve been saying for years,’ Mr Clegg told LBC Radio.

‘The Labour party is perfectly entitled to that view, all I’m saying is that they’ve arrived at it rather late in the day.’
