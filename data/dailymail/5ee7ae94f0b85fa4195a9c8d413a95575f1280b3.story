A long time ago, in a suburb not too far away, an iconic filmmaker bought a harbourside apartment.

But after choosing to settle in the Czech Republic, Star Wars producer Rick McCallum has resolved to sell his luxury Darling Point apartment in Sydney’s affluent eastern suburbs.

The timing for auctioning 2/47 New Beach Road  is ripe, with a string of recent sales suggesting demand for luxury apartments in Sydney is vastly exceeding supply, reports Domain.

McCallum bought the property in 2002 for $5.4 million, while it’s set to go under the hammer for over $6.5 million on March 9.

It comes after Sydney FC chairman Scott Barlow sold his waterfront apartment in one day for $8.25 million in October.  

Then there was the penthouse owned by of Robin White, widow of arts tycoon Ron White, which is situated in the same boutique block as McCallums current apartment. The property wasbelieved to have sold for over the $6 million guide. 

More recently, Lynette Harvey, the former wife of retail billionaire Gerry Harvey, sold her Double Bay penthouse for $9million earlier this month, well ahead of its planned March auction.

This recent streak of sales suggest McCalum won’t need the force on his side to sell the Darling Point pad as quick as a wink.
