A relationship counsellor has revealed how she has enjoyed affairs with a string of married men.

Louise Van der Velde insists: ‘I don’t wreck marriages - I SAVE them. I give men the chance to have some fun away from their wives and properly reassess their lives.

‘They have cheated in the first place because they are bored at home and they are going through the motions with their wives.

‘I don’t want anyone to leave their wives for me. I want them to go home and get some fire back in their marriage.'

Louise Van der Velde, the widow of a GP who lives with her two children in Camberley, Surrey, insists she has done nothing wrong by having multiple affairs with married men

Louise, 38, caused a storm earlier this year when she admitted that ‘marriage was for mugs’ after writing a book, Decent Proposal, which argued that more couples should embrace open relationships.

She provoked further controversy when she branded veteran This Morning agony aunt Denise Robertson an 'old battleaxe' after being challenged on the show about her views.

Today Louise reveals how she feels no shame about bedding married men - and blames their wives for the affairs she continues to enjoy with a string of men.

She is currently in a relationship with a rich married man she met while promoting her book on TV in Ireland.

Louise said: ‘We met in Dublin when I was asked to appear on a chat show to discuss my views on open relationships.

‘He had been in the audience in the show and he clearly liked what he saw.

‘He had never cheated on his wife before and they have a couple of children.

‘But he said that hearing me talk made him realise that his life was in a rut and he needed a change.

‘He doesn't want to leave his wife - he just wants some excitement in his life.

‘They have cheated in the first place because they are bored at home and they are going through the motions with their wives.'

‘They have been in a pretty stale relationship for a number of years and their whole marriage needs a giant electric shock.

‘I think, in the long-run, I will provide that electric shock.’

Louise was chatted up by the man who is in his 40s after appearing on The Saturday Night Show in Dublin last month.

They then went back to her hotel and enjoyed a wild weekend in the Irish capital.

Louise, 38, the widow of a GP who lives with her two children in Camberley, Surrey, insists she has done nothing wrong.

‘I'm not to blame for him cheating - he is and so is his wife,’ she said.

‘If there wasn't something wrong in the marriage he wouldn't have cheated in the first place.

‘But he unfortunately he has signed up to this crazy idea we have in the West that you should commit yourself to one partner and have sex with the same person for the next 50 years.

‘Whoever thought that was a good idea?’

She said her lover had two teenage children - and had no intention of leaving his wife.

‘I don't want him to either,’ explained Louise. ‘I am perfectly happy with our little arrangement.

‘We have a lot of fun. We have seen each other a couple of times since I appeared in the show.

‘It is very passionate and we both get a buzz out of seeing each other.

‘He admitted that his sex life with his wife had improved since he met me.

‘I think it has taught my lover and his wife that you don't have to settle for second best. That for a marriage to have fun and a bit of spark, you have to work at it.

‘At some point, our affair will fizzle out and I firmly believe that his marriage will be on a firmer footing when I'm gone.’

It's not the first married man Louise has bedded.

She had a second long affair with a married surgeon who, like her current lover, had never cheated on his wife before.

Louise said: ‘He also made all the running but I was happy to begin a relationship with him.

‘He
had married too young - in his mid 20s - and he was now in his early 
forties. He had only had sex with two women in all his life and he 
wanted to experience something new.

As well as being a relationship councillor Louise is also working as an ambassador for the extra-marital dating site Ashley Madison

‘He told me that he bitterly regretted settling down so young and wishes that he had waited till his thirties.

‘He was sowing his wild oats in his forties rather than in his late teens and twenties like most people.

‘If he hadn't cheated with me he would have done it with another woman.

‘I simply provided him with an outlet for years of pent up frustration.

‘We had great sex together for several months and had a lot of fun.

‘He didn't tell his wife about the 
affair but he insisted that he was a better, more attentive husband as a
result of his infidelity.

‘It made him work harder at his marriage and try to inject a bit of excitement in their lives.’

She had other affairs with married men who were unhappy with their wives but weren't ready to leave the family home.

Louise provides relationship counselling to couples in Harley Street, London, and at an exclusive retreat in Spain.

Her
aim is to reinvigorate relationships and marriages which have gone 
stale by embracing life enhancing techniques such as Tantric sex.

Louise is promoting her book 'Decent Proposal: Divine secrets from the pleasure professor'

She is also working as an ambassador for the extra-marital dating site Ashley Madison, which has seen a surge in new subscriptions this year.

Ashley Madison said a new British member joins every 45 seconds - making it the one of the fastest-growing markets in the world.

Britain has the highest divorce rate in Europe - with one in three marriages now ending in splits.

The figures have gone down slightly in recent years because many unhappy couples simply cannot afford to divorce in the recession and establish two homes.

Louise said: ‘It is true that there are fewer divorces. And that simply means that there are lots of unhappy husbands and wives looking to cheat.

‘An affair doesn't have to mean the end of a marriage. It could actually mean the start of a new period of happiness for a couple who have been taking each other for granted."

A spokesman for the dating site said: ‘The number of 50-plus married women 
in the UK joining us has surprised me. The foundation of our business in
Britain is the married woman.’

‘Women are disappointed by their spouses' lack of effort and they feel especially undervalued when there is a societal expectation of romance.'

A survey for the site found the capital of online adultery in Britain is Manchester, where there is one subscriber for every 27 people.

Decent Proposal by Louise Van der Velde is available on Kindle via Amazon. Louise's website is www.pleasureprofessor.com
