Losing a beloved dog can be like losing a member of the family, but one artist has come up with a clever solution to comfort grieving pet owners.

Lucy Francis Maloney creates miniature replicas of dead dogs that are scarily true to life.   

Lucy, 61, uses as little as an old photograph to 'resurrect' the deceased dogs as little furry mementos.

Lucy who lives in Saint Paul, Minnesota, came up with the idea in 1997 when her parents suggested creating a miniature version of their family dog, Old Ted, a Yorkshire terrier.

Combining household items such as string and loose hair from her family pet, the first miniature mutt was born.

Since then, she has created thousands of miniature dogs using yarn, chicken wire, and a selection of materials to replicate the fur including alpaca, cashmere, baby camel and occasionally real dog hair.

The addition of glass eyes and fur grooming completes the life-like look.

Having spent the last 18 years honing her skills, Lucy is now inundated with requests from pet owners across the world who are longing to resurrect their furry friends.

Often spending hours to produce them with meticulous detail, customers from Netherlands, Russia, Qatar, Germany and the UK pay anything between $200 (£132) and $2,000 (£1326) on Lucy's website for her realistic models.

Lucy's creations have received so much attention that she now receives orders from all over the world

The prospect of keeping a souvenir of their passed-on-pup has even seen Lucy receive interest from celebrity dog lovers, with Martha Stewart, Andrew WK, Shirley McLaine, John Prine and Keither Sykes all requesting a petite pooch of their own.

Lucy, owner of three dogs, says that she has been fascinated with pooches her whole life and this job means she can do what she loves.

'My passion for dogs has been with me since my earliest memory. All I wanted was to do something with dogs.

Lucy has even had several celebrities get in touch wanting to purchase a model including Martha Stewart

'I started working with miniatures when I created my old dog Ted, but soon word of my mini dogs reached other pet lovers and I started creating peoples' dogs exact to the photos.'

Lucy says that her replicas provide something that a photograph of an old pet can't. 

'People loved the idea of a three dimensional piece to remember and cherish their pet.

'Customers are usually reduced to tears when they see their dog brought back to life.'

As well as dogs that have passed away Lucy creates miniatures of live hounds too

Lucy says that she can completely emphasise with her customers and says that it is really rewarding to help owners through a difficult time. 

'When a dog is brought back to the owner in a realistic way it always brings emotions to the fore. I always work to get the dog as perfect as the real one.

'I love to reach people suffering that loss. I myself know the pain of losing a pet, combined with my unequalled love of dogs; I feel I have a profound understanding of the grief.'

The artist believes that a 3D model can provide more comfort to grieving pet owners than a flat photo 

Lucy has recently received a very special order that will see her work against the clock. 

'I recently received an urgent request from a mom: her son is about to leave for his fourth tour in Afghanistan Special forces, but his dog just died suddenly.

'She wants me to make a small one like it so he can take it with him when he goes at the end of this month.

'Dogs mean so much to people, I want to help when I can in my small way with a small replica that last forever.'
