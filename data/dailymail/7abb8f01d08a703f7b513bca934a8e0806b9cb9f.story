The former boyfriend of a young woman who fell 11 storeys to her death at the beginning of last year has been sentenced to six months behind bars.

Cheerleader Breeana Robinson, 21, fell from the balcony of the Gold Coast high-rise apartment of her controlling, obsessive boyfriend, Dan Shearin, a court heard earlier this month.

On Monday Shearin - who sent her thousands of text messages in the lead up to her death - was sentenced to six months in jail, The Courier Mail reported.

On Monday a court heard Ms Robinson received the last text message from her boyfriend, whom she had been living with for a little over a month, just ten minutes before her death.

Supporters also carried pictures of the young cheerleader, who had dreams of becoming a dancer despite having been legally blind since a young age. 

In the 38 days Ms Robinson was with Shearin before she fell to her death he sent her 1439 text messages, Southport Magistrate's Court heard earlier this month.

At 10.35pm on January 29, 2013 after she returned from cheerleading practice Ms Robinson fell from their luxury apartment, H20 Broadwater in the Gold Coast suburb of Southport.

The athletic, but slight, young woman fell the eleven storeys on to a Perspex awning above the shops and restaurants at the base of the iconic building. 

The court heard evidence that in one text message sent to Ms Robinson ten minutes before she died, Shearin said: 'You're more interested in TV, food and everything else but your partner. That's why everything's ruined. Your priorities are f***ed up'.

In another text message sent to Breanna that was heard in court, Shearin said: 'You're a complete f***ing moron. I don't want a stupid, dumb c***'.

Police investigating the death charged Shearin with using a carriage service to menace or harass Ms Robinson. He pleaded guilty.

Shearin has written a book, Confessions of a Cruise Ship Singer

Ms Robinson, who was legally blind from a young age, had been drawn to cruise ship entertainer Shearin through his promises of helping the pretty blonde to realise her dreams of a dancing career.

Shearin, who describes himself on Google Plus as 'Australia's premiere cruise ship vocalist/author & cruise ship specialist' was Ms Robinson's first boyfriend. 

Shearin, who friends of Ms Robinson's said is obsessed with Facebook and dating sites, has called girls 'bitches' and a 'psycho' on another of his Facebook pages.

On September 21, he posted, 'Haha. I love jealous bitches who can't handle rejection. One has set up an account on grindr with my phone number thinking that it might somehow embarrass me.

'Talk about psycho just coz she couldn't f*** me lol. She is so stupid that she doesn't realise that it is a criminal offence these days.'

Friends of Ms Robinson told Daily Mail Australia how the 'lovely young woman' who had struggled at school because of a chronic astigmatism called 'cat's eye', would have done anything to become a dancer.

'She believed Dan would help her achieve that goal,' the friend said, on condition of anonymity.

'She was the sweetest, kindest person, unaffected and always apologising,' the friend said.

Ms Robinson, who was unable to drive a car because of her sight problems, fought to be independent, and had travelled overseas to see the Moulin Rouge in Paris.

'She idolised Gold Coast dancer Anthony Ikin,' the friend said. 

'She knew she couldn't be a Moulin Rouge dancer, but she hoped to dance professionally and that's how she and [Dan Shearin] met.

'He promised to help her get work on cruise ships.'

Shearin has written a book, Confessions of a Neurotic Cruise Ship Singer, which has a subtext of sex and romance.

Shearin, who recently returned from a trip to Canada to appear at Southport Court, has reportedly fronted 'Las Vegas style' productions says on his Facebook page he has performed 'in over 30 different shows on cruise ships'.

On June 15 this year, he posted on Facebook, 'It just dawned one day as I walked along the beach that no matter how many dating sites I join, however many places I go, or how much time I spend searching for the right woman, none of it is going to speed up the process because the Universe has a plan and when the time is right, she will appear no matter how much time I spend in solitary.'

'Time to live life and stop waiting.'

On July 25, he posted: 'So sad to hear that another young woman has committed suicide from a Surfers hi-rise tonight. 

'My heart goes out to her family and all those innocent people who saw her land.

'Having witnessed this exact same situation myself, I hope those affected seek counselling.'

Following Ms Robinson's death, Shearin moved from the H20 apartment block and is now believed to be working for a Gold Coast time share company.
