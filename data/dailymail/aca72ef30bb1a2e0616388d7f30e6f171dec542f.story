A cadet officer has told an Italian court how Costa Concordia captain Francesco Schettino did not 'slip into a lifeboat' as he claims but jumped off while stricken passengers and crew were still on board.

Stefano Iannelli was giving evidence during the trial in which Schettino is accused of multiple manslaughter and abandoning the Costa Concordia after the luxury liner struck rocks off the coast of the Italian island of Giglio.

Thirty-two people died in the disaster and the trial has focused on the behaviour of Schettino, who was dubbed 'Captain Coward' after it emerged he had refused orders by coastguards to get back on board and help coordinate the rescue efforts.

Iannelli told the hearing in Grosseto: 'Captain Schettino, shortly before me, jumped onto the roof of a lifeboat by deck four, shortly afterwards the area where we were, was then underwater as the Concordia slipped on the rocks.

'We had formed a human chain so as not to slip, I was part of that team named Tango India and we helped five people who had been hurt.

'Then when I couldn't see any more passengers, together with Schettino and four others we went to went to where the lifeboats were.

'I jumped onto the roof but Schettino was already there, he had jumped just before me. As soon as the lifeboat launched, the ship rolled and the deck where we had been was submerged. We picked up passengers who were in the water as we headed to the shore.'

Schettino has insisted that he 'tripped and fell' into a lifeboat as the 290m luxury liner lay stricken on rocks just off the coast of the Italian island of Giglio but prosecutors insist he failed in his duty and fled the scene while more than 300 people were still onboard.

According to the investigation Schettino was on dry land just after midnight, nearly three hours after the Concordia has initially struck the rocks but the last person was not rescued until 4am.

Iannelli painted a vivid picture of the frantic panic that had gripped Schettino after he had steered the liner, which had more than 4,000 passengers and crew onboard, onto the rocks and said: 'He was saying "What have I done? I'm finished sailing."Â 

'My job was to monitor the equipment and make sure the ship was stable during sailing and I remember just as we struck the rocks there were vibrations and I could hear that we had scraped the bottom.'

Iannelli ended his testimony to the court by telling prosecutor Stefano Pizza that he had been told by other officers on the bridge, that Schettino had a 'briefcase with him between his legs' as he escaped in the lifeboat to safety.

While the rescue was ongoing and Schettino was in the lifeboat, in a widely reported telephone call that was leaked to the media, coastguard chief Gregorio De Falco can be heard ordering him:''Get back on board, for f***'s sake.'

But Schettino refused to do so and instead he made his way to a hotel on the island where he waited for officials to arrive and he was later taken away to the mainland where he was arrested and ultimately charged.

Salvage operators in Italy lifted the Costa Concordia cruise ship upright from its watery grave off the island of Giglio in September, in the biggest ever project of its kind. It will soon be scrapped

In a break during the hearing, Alessandro Maria Lecci, a lawyer representing the island of Giglio, said: 'Everyone knew that night the Concordia's route - you just had to watch it on the internet and various marine traffic websites - you could see that the ship had changed route.'

Prosecutors say that Schettino deliberately altered the course of the Concordia so that he could carry out the sail by salute of Giglio and so impress passengers and islanders but it was a course of action that proved dramatically and tragically foolhardy.

The disaster happened on January 13, 2012, just hours after the Costa Concordia had left the port of Civitavecchia for a seven day Mediterranean cruise and on board there were 35 British passengers and crew.

If convicted Schettino faces a minimum of 20 years in jail - meanwhile salvage experts confirmed today that the Concordia has been made secure in the face of strong winter storms forecast to hit the area, with a system of 28 steel anchors.
