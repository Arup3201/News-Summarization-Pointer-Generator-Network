They are best known for singing about combine harvesters and cider. Now The Wurzels have been inspired by a more recent feature of rural life – wind turbines.

And with a lyric that runs: ‘They’re noisy, they’re ugly and no one wants them here’, the so-called Scrumpy and Western group have made it clear just what they think of them.

The Mendip Windfarm Song, the band’s first single in three years, was written after developers revealed proposals for a 220ft turbine close to The Wurzels’ base in Norton St Philip, Somerset.

West Country rockers The Wurzels have released their first single in years - a protest song about a wind farm

A spokesman for the group, formed by the late Adge Cutler in 1966, said the protest song – available to download on iTunes – highlighted the proliferation of turbines across the countryside.

The song is also a tribute to Wurzels’ founder who died 40 years ago this year.

He was responsible for great songs as the 1976 number one hit ‘Combine Harvester’, and the number three hit ‘I Am a Cider Drinker’.

Adge died after falling asleep at the wheel of his MGB sports car which overturned on a roundabout approaching the Severn Bridge.

The Wurzels have decided to return to Adge’s style of involving observations of life in the Westcountry with ‘The Mendip Windfarm Song’.

The Mendip Windfarm Song, the band's first single in three years, was written after developers revealed proposals for a 220ft turbine close to The Wurzels' base in Norton St Philip, Somerset

It is aimed at highlighting the 
proliferation of proposals for wind turbines across the Westcountry, and
 the UK, which the cider-fuelled songsters say are 'disregarding the 
views of the local communities they are imposed upon'.

The singers tell how one 'warm and misty morning a note dropped through my door, with a proposal for a wind farm thing'.

It goes on: 'They wind farms they be all across the Mendips. You’ll see them from Wells and Stanton Drew?.they are noisy, they’re ugly and no-one wants them here.'

And they plead: 'I understand the argument for greener energy, but save our countryside for you and me' as a cow adds its own mournful mooing plea in the background.

Sil Willcox, a spokesman for the band said: 'Renewable energy has to be considered as an important part of the make-up of our energy solutions.

'However imposing these cost inefficient turbines on communities after they have been opposed by local parishes and refused by planners seems very unfair and undemocratic.

'It seems that the Government have lost their will to support onshore wind farms and the general public are unhappy to fund the huge subsidies we are forced to pay to finance them. So why are the inspectorates still allowed to overturn local views and decisions?'

The Mendip Windfarm Song is available to download on iTunes from May 11.
