The former student who killed six people in a vengeful rampage in Santa Barbara had told a friend he wanted to hold down and rape women, the friend's mother has revealed.

Cathleen Bloeser's son was a childhood friend of killer Elliot Rodger and was among the 30 people who received his sick manifesto by email just seconds before he carried out the murders.

In the 141-page document, 22-year-old Rodger described how he was going to kill his housemates, then slaughter women at a sorority house before opening fire on the streets of Isla Vista. He explained that he was driven to kill after numerous women had rejected him.

'We could see that he was turning,' 
Mrs Bloeser said. 'He'd changed emotionally, and he'd become very despondent and he wanted
 to get back at people.'

Killer: Elliot Rodger, pictured, told friends he had thoughts of raping women, family friends said

It comes as new details, reported by the National Post on Monday, reveal that, at the beginning of Friday's rampage, Rodger had pounded on the front door of the Alpha Phi sorority house with the intention of opening fire - but no one answered.

Several women heard Rodger's 'aggressive knocking,' Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said. 'Fortunately, no one opened.'

Instead, he walked around the corner and opened fire on a group of students outside - shooting three, two of whom died. He then went on to kill another student and injure many more.

Mrs Bloeser said that within the last year, his mental health had deteriorated and he was under psychiatric care but not taking his medication at the time of the spree.

She said Rodger, who had spoken to her son Philip and another one of his friends about wanting to sexually assault women, had invited her son over to stay at his home over the weekend.

But he and another childhood friend did not stay at the apartment. On Saturday, Rodger's two roommates and another male friend were found there stabbed to death.

Relief: Bloeser's mother (right) said her son could've been shot if he had agreed to go to the killer's home

'I have a feeling that they would have been right there as a part of it and shot as well,' she said.

Moments after sending the manifesto to his mother, father, former teachers and friends, Rodger went on his shooting spree.

Family 
friend Simon Astaire told Reuters that Rodger's mother, Chin, had also received a phone call on the night of the shooting from his therapist 
alerting her to the manifesto.

She
 called police and her ex-husband, Peter Rodger, and the two parents 
raced to Isla Vista - but she heard radio reports about the shootings as
 she drove.

As well as emailing the 30 people his manifesto, he also shared his hate for women in a video posted online called Elliot Rodger's Retribution.

He unleashed a tirade about his 'loneliness, rejection, and unfulfilled desires,' and blamed women for preferring 'obnoxious brutes' to him, 'the supreme gentleman'.

Victims: Rodger's victims included his roommates Weihan Wang, left, and Cheng Yuan Hong, right, who were found dead inside his apartment. Bloeser's mother says she thinks her son would have also been killed

'I'm 22 years old and I'm still a virgin. I've never even kissed a girl,' he said in the video.

'College is the time when everyone experiences those things such as sex and fun and pleasure. But in those years I've had to rot in loneliness. It's not fair. You girls have never been attracted to me. I don't know why you girls aren't attracted to me. But I will punish you all for it.'

He repeatedly promised to 'punish' women and lays out his plan for 'retribution' in the video.

On Friday, Rodger, the son of Hunger Games assistant director Peter Rodger, acted upon his threats, killing six people before shooting himself dead.

Weihan Wang, 20, of Fremont, and Cheng Yuan Hong, 20, of San Jose, were both stabbed to death by Rodger on Friday at the apartment they had shared with him.

The body of another UCSB student, George Chen, 19, of San Jose, was also found at the apartment, but he did not live there.

Rodger then climbed into his SUV and drove towards the Alpha Phi sorority house, where he shot dead Katherine Cooper, 22, and Veronika Weiss, 19.

He then got back into his car and drove to a nearby deli, where he opened fire. There, he killed student Chris Michael-Martinez, 20, in an attack that was captured on surveillance footage.

The gunman then climbed back into his car and continued to shoot at passersby as he drove, hitting three pedestrians before he police officers returned fire and shot him in the hip.

He tried to escape and knocked down a cyclist, before he eventually shot himself in the head and smashed into parked cars.

When police found his body, he was surrounded by three semi-automatic handguns and nearly 400 rounds of ammunition, which had all been purchased legally.
