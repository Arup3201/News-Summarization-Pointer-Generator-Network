Jose Mourinho insists specialists have told him Loic Remy 'does not have a problem to play football' a month after the QPR striker's move to Liverpool collapsed due to a failed medical.

The 27-year-old agreed personal terms with the Anfield outfit after his release clause was met by an £8.5million bid, but Liverpool pulled out of the deal following the results of a fitness assessment.

Mourinho, though, says he recognises no problem with the France forward ahead of a potential medical with Chelsea to replace Fernando Torres, who joined AC Milan on a two-year loan.

'I told my people in the club that I have no news until the end of this game,' Mourinho told SkySports after Chelsea beat Everton 6-3 at Goodison on Saturday evening.

'They know I don’t like communicating before a game. 

'I know that we’re trying since yesterday to get Loic Remy, since we knew Fernando was leaving.

'Now it’s time to make some calls and have news. We have a fantastic doctor and I trust him completely. They will identify any problem.

'He has lots of people working with him in different areas, and for sure we’ll try to identify clearly what the situation is. 

'The information we have from specialists in different areas is that he does not have a problem to play football.'

Torres ended his three-and-a-half year stint with Chelsea by joining AC Milan on Friday. The striker, having signed for £50m in 2011 from Liverpool, will see out the remainder of his contract in Serie A.
