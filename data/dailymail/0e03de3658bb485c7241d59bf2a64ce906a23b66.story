Bobby Brown dramatically stormed out of his ex-wife Whitney Houston's funeral today.

The 43-year-old singer was cheered by fans as he arrived - but according to a mourner at the service family became 'frustrated' inside.

TMZ reports he became angry after the Houston family refused to seat his entourage of nine people. He had apparently been invited with a plus two.

Insiders told the website Brown wanted to sit with his daughter Bobbi Kristina on the front row - but he was disallowed.

Brown - who is set to take to the stage tonight in Connecticut to perform as part of his tour - has since released a statement, explaining his abrupt departure, saying he was moved by security three times.

In a statement put out by his 
representative, he said: 'My children and I were invited to the funeral 
of my ex-wife Whitney Houston.  We were seated by security and then 
subsequently asked to move on three separate occasions.

'I fail to understand why security treated my family this way and continue to ask us and no one else to move,' he said. 

The statement went on: 'Security then 
prevented me from attempting to see my daughter Bobbi Kristina. In light
 of the events, I gave a kiss to the casket of my ex-wife and departed 
as I refused to create a scene.

'My children are completely distraught
 over the events. This was a day to honour Whitney. I doubt Whitney 
would have wanted this to occur. I will continue to pay my respects to 
my ex-wife the best way I know how.'

A mourner told the MailOnline: 'He was frustrated about something, maybe somebody 
said something to him or he was in a mood.'

Meanwhile, the outspoken Reverend Al Sharpton revealed he had spoken to Brown in an attempt to calm him down.

He tweeted: 'I am 
at Whitney's funeral. I spoke with Bobby Brown trying to calm him down 
and not distract from the services. Today is about Whitney!'

He later spoke to reporters, sticking up for Brown.

'He showed nothing but love and respect for Whitney. I wish people would leave Bobby alone,' he said.

Meanwhile Reverend Jesse Jackson told CNN reporters that Brown's daughter Bobbi Kristina and Houston's mother Cissy weren't aware of the fracas and did not see it happen from the two rows in front of Brown's designated seat.

Jackson, who was seated on stage throughout the service and saw the incident occur, said he believed that the situation 'could have been handled better.'

Early reports suggested Brown, who became divorced from Whitney in 2007, was denied entry to the New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, New Jersey.

Shortly after the service began he was
 seen leaving the church with a grim expression on his face accompanied 
by a female companion.

They stood outside for a few moments before getting in to a waiting SUV and drove off.

Brown, who Houston's family blamed for her drug addiction, had 
reportedly been invited after her family put aside their differences and
 begrudgingly said he could come.

Moments after the drama singer Stevie Wonder arrived and was led up the church steps and through the front door.

As Brown was waiting outside the church an unidentified man stood next to him crying uncontrollably.

Brown himself appeared to be wiping away a tear as he got into his car.

Live coverage from inside Houston's funeral showed her daughter Bobbi Kristina and mother Cissy sat on the front row.

They were yards away from 
Whitney's flower drenched coffin, which took centre stage on the very 
alter where she sang as a child at the New Hope Baptist Church in 
Newark, New Jersey.

Meanwhile,
 it was claimed today that Houston's family members are encouraging 
Bobbi Kristina to enter a live-in rehab facility as soon as possible.

According
 to TMZ, the late singer's relatives want Krissi to seek drug treatment,
 but they are holding off on telling her until after Whitney's funeral 
today.

Sources connected
 to Whitney's family tell the entertainment website that the 18-year-old
 has struggled with substance abuse issues for the last three or four 
years.

Now family members are urging her to 
get professional help at a 60-day live-in treatment facility before her 
alleged drug use gets worse.

But they want to give Krissi time to grieve, and will not push the issue until after Whitney's funeral.

Last
 March Bobbi Kristina took to Twitter to deny claims she had checked 
into rehab after pictures surfaced that allegedly showed her snorting 
lines of cocaine.

Her famous mother, who struggled 
with her own battle against drug addiction up until her death, was said 
to have desperately pushed the teenager to seek treatment last year, but
 Krissi pushed back.

'Excuse
 me,' Bobbi Kristina tweeted, 'but I’d like to say that I am NOT going 
to rehab? I’m perfectly healthy and I am not addicted to anything but 
life.'

The
 National Enquirer, which first published the scandalous pictures, 
reported that Whitney had attempted an intervention of sorts.

The
 publication quoted a source as saying: 'She called a family meeting and
 sobbed as she told Krissi, "I don’t want to lose you.'"

'Whitney called Bobby [Brown], and they agreed that Krissi needs rehab,' the friend was quoted as saying.

'They
 also agreed on a tough-love move to shake Krissi up, and Whitney 
returned a Lexus convertible that she’d bought for Krissi’s birthday.'
