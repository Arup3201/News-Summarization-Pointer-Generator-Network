Wolves defender Sam Ricketts, 33, is considering joining Coventry City on loan. 

Ricketts has not featured for the Championship promotion contenders since November and has only made five appearances for the club in all competitions this season.

The former Swansea City full-back is out of contract at Molineux this summer.

Wolves boss Kenny Jackett said: 'They made an enquiry, I don't know what Sam's decision is. 

'It'll be his decision and if he decides to pursue that the club will talk finances and length of time. 

'The only thing available is an emergency loan anyway.' 

Ricketts signed for Wolves from Bolton in 2013 and has been a regular fixture in the Wales squad since being given his international debut by John Toshack against Hungary in 2005.
