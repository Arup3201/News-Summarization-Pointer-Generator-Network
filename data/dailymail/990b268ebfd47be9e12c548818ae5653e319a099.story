The elderly heiress whose money and how it was spent is the main focus of the John Edwards trial had a huge crush on him and would be 'euphoric' whenever the former senator was around, a friend testified.

Bryan Huffman, an interior designer who became one of Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon's closest confidants, took to the stand yesterday at the Greensboro Court House in North Carolina.

Reiterating what other witnesses have said about the now 101-year-old millionaire, Mr Huffman told the jury: 'She liked how he looked, what he espoused and what good he could do for the country.'

She first met Edwards in 2004 and was said to have been in love with him ever since.

Better today: Edwards was joined by his eldest daughter Cate as they headed into the trial on Thursday, just one day after she left the court in tears

Benefactor: Paul and Bunny Mellon stand with horse sculpture at Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond, Virginia, circa 1987. Bunny is now blind and a recluse

Heiress: Bunny Mellon, right, is one of the 
wealthy donors who allegedly provided Edwards with almost $1million to 
cover up his affair

Mr Huffman is one of the people who is believed to have helped hide the huge campaign donations from Bunny that were allegedly used to hide his affair with Rielle Hunter and subsequent love child.

Edwards'
attorneys have said he didn't know about the money and Edwards has 
pleaded not guilty to six counts related to campaign-finance violations.
He faces up to 30 years in prison and $1.5million in fines.

The 48-year-old recounted what Bunny said after a December 2005 
meeting with Edwards at her 4,000-acre estate: 'There goes the next president of the 
United States.'

He testified that she was more than happy to pay for personal expenses for Edwards after the controversy about his expensive haircut in 2007.

'The campaign gave [Mellon] a wonderful 
focus and something to hold on to,' Mr Huffman said. Every phone call from 
Edwards 'always made her extremely happy'.

'She was having fun with this,' he added.

But there was one thing clear about Edwards' visits to her sprawling estate - he was not allowed to bring his wife Elizabeth, who Mr Huffman said she hated.

'Unless Mrs Edwards could come then Mr Edwards couldn’t come,' Huffman recalled.

The now blind and reclusive Bunny told Newsweek in an interview last year: 'John had a hard time with Elizabeth.'

Her lawyer Alex Forger added his client 'was not enamored of his wife and didn’t want his wife to know that he was getting money.'

In stride: Yesterday's witness told how Edwards (right) denied having a relationship with 'crazy' Hunter but Hunter told the aide directly that she and the then-Senator 'were very much in love'

Another former close aide to John 
Edwards also testified yesterday about bungled efforts to keep the 
former presidential candidate's affair hidden from staff members, 
including an awkward confirmation of his suspicions from the mistress herself. 

Mr Davis, who traveled with Edwards 
in 2006 and 2007 as a body man, is one of several former aides who have 
testified about their suspicion or knowledge of the affair during 
Edwards' campaign finance corruption trial.

Ms
Hunter's contract with the staff wasn't renewed at the end of 2006, but
Mr Davis hadn't seen the last of her. He testified that in February 
2007, he ran into her in an elevator at the candidate's Detroit hotel.

‘We exchanged brief pleasantries. I would have preferred not to have seen her,’ he said.

When he saw that she pushed the button
for Edwards' floor – where Davis also had his room – he stopped on 
another floor just so he could get into a different elevator car. 
Shortly after, he was on the phone with his wife to express his shock at
seeing Ms Hunter.

Possible defence witness: Rielle Hunter, the 
former mistress of John Edwards, enters the federal courthouse in 
Raleigh, North Carolina, Thursday, August 6, 2009 with the pair's child 
Frances Quinn Hunter

He heard a knock at the door of his room. It was the mistress, who came in to talk.

‘She told me that she and Senator Edwards were very much in love. And that he was concerned that I had seen her,’ Mr Davis said.

The next day, Edwards called Davis into his room and denied that he was having an affair with Hunter.

‘He
told me she was crazy and that we should make sure she didn't talk to 
him,’ Mr Davis said, adding that he was satisfied with his boss's 
explanation.

Mr Davis is the latest in a string of 
witnesses who have been brought by the prosecution to detail the steps 
that the campaign staff took to keep Edwards’ bid for the presidency, 
and then the vice presidency, leading up to Barack Obama’s victory in 
2008.

In the Greensboro, 
North Carolina court room on Thursday, Mr Davis told how staffers like 
himself had growing concerns when they noticed how close Ms Hunter and 
Edwards became after she was hired as a videographer for the campaign in
2006.

Disgraced: Edwards could face 30 years in prison and a $1.5million fine if found guilty

'Sexually voracious': Before she was known as 
John Edwards' mistress, Rielle Hunter dated an author who based a 'coke 
addled' and 'sexually voracious' character on her

For example, while other staff members called him ‘Senator Edwards,’ Rielle Hunter called him ‘Johnny’ or ‘John’.

Not long after Mr Davis' elevator run in with Ms Hunter, a change was made in hotel arrangements that struck Mr Davis as odd.

'Can people tell that you're showing?'

-Former Edwards aide John Davis said he heard the then-candidate ask Rielle Hunter

Mr
Davis said he'd always stayed in a room close to the candidate, but 
that the staff began staying on a different floor than the candidate 
during trips.

‘Mr Edwards suggested maybe a little separation would be good,’ he said.

His
most explosive revelation was what he heard when he went to Edwards' 
hotel room to retrieve a cell phone that the candidate had borrowed from
him.

When he got to the 
room, he could hear what sounded like a speakerphone conversation 
through the door, and he was able to discern both Edwards and Ms 
Hunter's voices, and he heard Edwards inquire about how far along Ms 
Hunter was in her pregnancy.

‘I heard him ask Rielle if she was showing yet,’ Mr Davis said of the September 2007 incident.

'Can people tell that you're showing?' Mr Davis said Edwards asked.

Indiscreet: The court has heard specific details about the cover-up, like how Rielle would demand to be flown on private
jets with Edwards and that he was often seen wheeling around her 
luggage

Ms Hunter gave birth to Edwards’ daughter
Frances Quinn in February 2008, and given the date of the phone call, 
that would have made Ms Hunter about four months pregnant at the time.

‘Rielle is a very unique personality,’ Mr Davis said in court on Thursday.

‘Everyone else on the team had a 
political background. Rielle didn't have that sort of resume. She talked
a lot about meditation and yogis’

Though the details of Ms Hunter-spottings add to the intrigue level about the illicit affair, the most emotional day of testimony surely came yesterday, when Edwards’ daughter Cate left the courtroom crying.

Former Edwards aide Christina Reynolds was testifying about an argument Elizabeth Edwards had with her husband on the day in October 2007 that a tabloid published a story about his affair.

As Ms Reynolds was beginning the account about what happened at the Raleigh airport, Edwards turned to his daughter Cate, who was seated in the front row.

'I don't know what's coming. Do you want to leave?' Edwards was heard asking.

She responded inaudibly to him, then walked away wiping tears. Edwards was heard saying, 'Cate, Cate' as she walked out. Cate Edwards later returned to court after a recess.

Ms Reynolds testified, she observed a very upset Elizabeth Edwards confront her husband at Raleigh-Durham International Airport on the morning that The National Enquirer published a story about the affair.

court Tuesday with his daughter Cate (center) as the damaging testimony 
continued about his affair and ensuing cover up with Rielle Hunter

Upset: Cate Edwards, pictured with her father Tuesday, ran out of the court room in tears Wednesday when she heard stories about her parent's fighting

She stormed off and then collapsed in the parking lot, Ms Reynolds said, and the aide and another staff member helped her into the bathroom of a private hangar.

After collecting herself, Elizabeth Edwards came back into the hangar, found her husband and began yelling. She then pulled off her shirt and bra, leaving herself bare-chested, Reynolds said.

'You don't see me any more,' Reynolds quoted the wife as saying.

Testimony will continue tomorrow as the trial ends the second of what is expected to be six weeks of hearings.
