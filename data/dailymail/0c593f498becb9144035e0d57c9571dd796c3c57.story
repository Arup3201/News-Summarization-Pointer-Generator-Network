The Commons Deputy Speaker who quit after being after being charged with a series of sex offences against seven men is in line for a £9,000 pay-off from the taxpayer.

Nigel Evans, who delivered an extraordinary personal statement in the Commons yesterday, resigned his £36,000 post vowing to ‘robustly defend my innocence and seek acquittal’.

He has been charged with the 
rape of a man between March 29 and April 1, 2013, five sexual assaults 
dating back to 2009 and two indecent assaults dating back to 2002.

Speech: Nigel Evans addressed MPs in a personal statement after Prime Minister's Questions

Under parliamentary rules, when ministers and Commons officials stand down they are entitled to a 'severance payment' worth a quarter of their annual salary.

It means Mr Evans must be offered £9,090 of his £36,360 salary for serving as deputy to Commons speaker John Bercow.

Elected as a Conservative, Mr Evans has vowed to continue as an independent MP for Ribble Valley which comes with a separate salary of £65,738.

Robert Oxley, Campaign director of the Taxpayers' Alliance, called for the severance deals to be scrapped.

He added: 'Politicians resigning from a post should not receive a payoff.

'This wouldn’t happen in the private sector so why should it be any different when taxpayers are footing the bill?'

In his personal statement to the Commons yesterday, Mr Evans quoted Churchill and he referred to the death of his mother and the spiritual 
support of Parliament’s chaplain before thanking fellow MPs for their 
‘hugs, prayers and good wishes’.

Speaking immediately after Prime 
Minster’s Questions, he told a packed Commons chamber: ‘I hope you will 
bear with me while I make this statement, it’s been a few years since I 
made a speech in this chamber and I’m sad to say this is the speech. 

‘As many of you will know following 
recent allegations, I was charged with alleged offences yesterday. I now
have the opportunity to robustly defend my innocence and seek 
acquittal.

‘I have therefore
decided the best course of action is for me to return to the 
backbenches and this is a decision I have made myself after careful 
consideration.’

When he left
Preston police station on Tuesday night, he gave a short statement before 
saying he ‘will not be making any further comment until after the case 
concludes’.

But in the Commons he spoke at length about the impact of the case on his life.

Thanks: Evans listed the many people he says have shown him 'compassionate consideration'

Evans said: ‘It was one of the happiest days of my life when I was elected deputy speaker in 2010, it was an endorsement of my abilities to do the job by my colleagues and for that I am grateful.

‘Since these allegations, I have not been able to fully fulfil my duties in the chair, which left me in a land of limbo.

‘None of us were elected to the fine office of Member of Parliament to be put in that invidious position, unable to fully fulfil the reason why we were sent here.’

He said he was ‘grateful’ for the ‘unstinting support’ he has received from Mr Bercow and the other two deputy speakers, Lindsay Hoyle and Dawn Primarolo.

Evans went on: ‘When I told Ms Primarolo on Saturday my decision, I even got a hug from her - thank you Dawn.

‘I have had so many hugs, prayers and good wishes since May 4 and I would like to thank everyone who has shown me such compassionate consideration, my family particularly, my association, who have been marvellous, and even seasoned, crusty journalists have displayed a heart I have never before witnessed.

‘I was told I would soon see who my real friends are and that has been true. But the truth is there have been so many of them - so thank you to my dearest loyal friends, including loyal members of my staff at Westminster and the Ribble Valley.

Grateful: Speaker John Bercow paid tribute to Mr Evans twice in the Commons

‘And to you, my colleagues, on all sides of the House who have spoken with me, looked after me and just shown loving attention. Party divisions disappear in times like this and they have, thank you.

‘Rose Hudson-Wilkin, the Speaker’s chaplain, and Andrew Tremlett, the canon of Westminster Abbey, have given me superb spiritual guidance which has given me the one thing everyone in this world needs, alongside air, water and food: that is hope.

‘Hope is that essential key to giving us a fulfilled life and they have ensured I have retained that hope.’

Evans said: ‘This is clearly the most painful thing I have endured in my life alongside the loss of my mother in 2009 and the loss of my brother earlier this year.

‘Winston Churchill said when you are going through hell, keep going. Sage advice. And so I will see this through to the end with the support of the people that mean so much to me.’

The Ribble Valley MP added: ‘Returning to the backbenches gives me the opportunity to speak out on issues such as the over-building of new homes in the Ribble Valley, threats to the Slaidburn doctors’ surgery and cuts to rural bus services.

‘It’s the bread and butter of politics, giving support to the people who put me in the mother of parliaments, my home for the past 21 years and a place that has meant so much to me.

‘I am proud to serve the people of the Ribble Valley and the best tribute I can give them now is to get on with the job that they sent me here to do.’

Tory MP Nadine Dorries placed a hand on Evans’s shoulder as he sat down after his statement.

Earlier, at the start of Commons session, Mr Bercow said: ‘I have received his resignation with sadness. I wish to thank Nigel for his three years of service to the House as deputy speaker, in which he has proved to be highly competent, fair and good-humoured.

‘He has been a loyal and valued member of the team of deputy speakers who assist me in chairing our proceedings. I am warmly grateful to him.’

Evans will appear before magistrates in Preston on September 18.

The indecent assaults are alleged to have been committed between January 1, 2002 and January 1, 2004; the sexual assaults between January 1, 2009 and April 1 this year; and the rape between March 29 and April 1 this year.

Evans's initial arrest in early May related to offences alleged to have been committed in Pendleton, Lancashire

Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer said: ‘Following an investigation by Lancashire police, the Crown Prosecution Service has received a file of evidence in the case of Mr Nigel Evans MP which concerns allegations of a sexual nature.

‘After careful consideration, we have concluded that there is sufficient evidence and that it is in the public interest to prosecute Evans.

‘Lancashire Constabulary has therefore been authorised to charge two counts of indecent assault, five counts of sexual assault and one count of rape relating to a total of seven alleged victims.

‘The decision in this case was taken by Joanne Cunliffe, an experienced specialist rape prosecutor, in consultation with John Dilworth, head of the CPS North West Complex Casework Unit and in consultation with an external and highly experienced criminal QC.

‘I have also been consulted on this case. The decision has been taken in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors and the CPS legal guidance on rape and sexual offences.’

Evans, from Pendleton, Lancashire, stepped aside from his deputy speaker duties after his arrest but had continued to work as an MP.

He was one of three deputy speakers elected in a secret ballot of MPs in 2010. Later that year he came out as gay, saying he was ‘’tired of living a lie’’.

He was a vice chairman of the Conservative Party from 1999 to 2001. When Iain Duncan Smith became party leader in 2001, he was promoted to the shadow cabinet as shadow Welsh secretary - a post he held for two years.
