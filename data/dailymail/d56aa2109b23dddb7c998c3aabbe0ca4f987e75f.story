Workers are to be offered tax-free shares to surrender employment rights, George Osborne revealed  yesterday.

Under the Chancellor's plan, employees will receive as little as £2,000 when they agree not to sue their employers if they are mistreated or unfairly dismissed.

Workers will also be required to give up their right to time off for training purposes, give longer notice if they intend to return to their jobs after parental leave and lose their redundancy protections.

Compromise: Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne offered a bargain to workers in his speech in Birmingham

A week after Labour attempted to 
hijack the Tories’ ‘one nation’ philosophy, Mr Osborne jokingly used the
 Marxist slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite’.

Business leaders hailed the proposal 
as a key step towards a more dynamic and flexible workforce, and the 
Chancellor’s aides predicted hundreds of thousands of employees would 
take up the offer.

But it infuriated union leaders, who 
accused the Government of chiselling away at employment rights and 
insisted few workers would be interested.

Under the scheme, ‘employee-owners’ 
will be given between £2,000 and £50,000 of shares by their firms that 
will be exempt from capital gains tax when sold.

In return, they will agree to give up 
their right to claim unfair dismissal, redundancy pay, the right to 
request flexible working or time off for training and will have to give 
twice as much notice of intent to return from parental leave.

Legislation to bring in the new 
optional contract will be introduced later this year and be put into law
 in time for companies to use it from April next year. 

Announcing the policy to the Tory 
conference in Birmingham, Mr Osborne said it would appeal to new 
businesses starting up and small and medium-sized firms who need 
flexible labour and highly-motivated staff.

In a sombre speech, the Chancellor 
insisted he would not be diverted from his plans to cut the deficit, 
despite the double dip recession.

The share option plan unveiled yesterday 
combines Tory demands for less business red tape and a Lib Dem policy to
 encourage more employee-ownership.

Staff would be offered £2,000 to £50,000 of which would be exempt from any capital gains tax.

They would then give up their rights to claim unfair
 dismissal, statutory redundancy pay, requesting flexible working and 
asking for longer parental leave.

Employee-owner shares would be optional for existing staff but it could be compulsory for new hires or start-up firms.

Legislation will be fast-tracked so the changes can come into force from April 2013.

The scheme could cost £100m in 2017-18.

Government sources said they expected take up to be highest among fast-growing small and mid-sized businesses.

Mr
 Osborne said: 'Get shares and become owners of the company you work 
for. Owners, workers, and the taxman, all in it together.'

He insisted he would not repeat the 
mistakes of Edward Heath in 1972, who ‘two years into office was faced 
with economic problems and over powerful unions buckled and gave up’.

He attempted to woo the ‘strivers’ 
who handed Margaret Thatcher three election victories, saying the party 
represented ‘all those who aspire, all who work, save and hope, all who 
feel a responsibility to put in, not just take out’.

‘Whether it’s the owner of the corner
 shop staying open until midnight to support their family, or the 
teacher prepared to defy her union and stay late to take the 
after-school club,’ the Chancellor added.

Or the commuter who leaves home before
 the children are up, and comes back long after they have gone to bed, 
because they want a better life for them.

Or the pensioner, who has 
saved all their life, and doesn’t want to spend it all as they want to 
pass something on to their children.

‘Or the entrepreneur who doesn’t cash out and pack up, but devotes their flair and energy to building the next success story.

‘They are all part of one nation – one nation working together to get on. That is the nation we represent.’

Mr Osborne won big cheers as he flatly
 rejected Liberal Democrat demands for a ‘mansion tax’ on expensive 
properties – warning that ‘once the tax inspector had his foot in the 
door you’d soon find most homes in the country labelled a “mansion”, 
homes people have worked hard to afford and already paid taxes on’.

‘It’s not a mansion tax, it’s homes tax and this party of home ownership will have no truck with it,’ he declared.

But he said those at the ‘very top’ 
would have to pay more towards the deficit reduction programme, as long 
as it could be done without ‘damaging the enterprise economy’.

He told delegates ‘the economy is 
healing’ but warned that ‘healing is taking longer than we hoped because
 the damage was greater than we feared’.

The Chancellor announced that as 
austerity measures continue into the next Parliament, he will continue 
the current split of 80 per cent of the effort coming from reduced 
spending and 20 per cent from taxes.

He confirmed plans to slash a further 
£10billion from the welfare budget – proposing removing housing benefit 
from the young unemployed and limits on handouts to jobless parents who 
insist on having more children, without being able to afford them.

George Osborne suffered a setback 
last night as the International Monetary Fund said it now expects the UK
 economy to shrink by 0.4 per cent this year – far worse than the growth
 of 0.2 per cent it predicted in July.

It also downgraded its 2013 growth 
forecast from 1.4 per cent to 1.1 per cent – little more than half the 2
 per cent expected by the Treasury in another blow to the Chancellor.

But there was better news from the 
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development which said the 
British economy is picking up even as the eurozone plunges deeper into 
crisis.

Mr Osborne also suggested that some of
 the cuts would come from freezing benefits. He said: ‘How can we 
justify the incomes of those out-of-work rising faster than the incomes 
of those in work?’

Attacking Labour’s demands for more 
debt-fuelled public spending, he said: ‘Our critics gamble everything: 
our credibility, our financial stability, our low interest rates, the 
cost of our debt – they would risk everything on the dubious idea that a
 few billion more of spending would dramatically improve the fortunes of
 a trillion and a half-pound British economy.’

Unveiling his employee-ownership 
scheme, he described it as a ‘three way deal’. ‘You the company: give 
your employees shares in the business.

You the employee: replace your old rights of unfair dismissal and redundancy with new rights of ownership,’ he said.

‘And what will the Government do? 
We’ll charge no capital gains tax at all on the profit you make on your 
shares. Zero per cent capital gains tax for these new employee-owners.

‘Get shares and become owners of the 
company you work for. Owners, workers, and the taxman, all in it 
together. Workers of the world, unite.’
