Agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration conducted surprise inspections on medical staff of at least three NFL teams on Sunday, the agency said.

The ongoing investigation was prompted by a lawsuit brought by former players claiming that teams have mishandled prescription drugs for decades.

The San Francisco 49ers were targeted after playing away against the New York Giants and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers were checked at the Baltimore-Washington International after their game.

Probe: The Drug Enforcement Administration began a probe into NFL teams' handling of prescription drugs with raids against three teams Sunday

The Seattle Seahawks confirmed their medical staff was also checked by the agency for compliance with prescription drug regulations while visiting Kansas City.

The Washington Post reports that a law enforcement official speaking on condition of anonymity said there was a specific interest in the three teams investigated. 

There were no arrests Sunday, Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Rusty Payne confirmed.

Agents inspected documents from medical staffs for any controlled substances brought by visiting teams, along with records that the staff could practice in the home team's state.

'Our teams cooperated with the DEA today and we have no information to indicate that irregularities were found,' NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy told the Associated Press in an email.

In May, former NFL players brought a lawsuit against the league, claiming that teams and their medical staffs acted without regard for players' well-being,

Now with more than 1,200 players with careers going back to 1968, the plaintiffs allege that NFL staffs plied them with painkillers such as Vicodin and anti-inflammatories like Toradol  to keep them playing.

The lawsuit claims that teams did this against regulations and often without players' knowledge or consent as to what drug 'cocktails' contained.

One attorney for the players described staffs dispensing prescription drugs 'like candy at Halloween.'

The New York Daily News reports that former Chicago Bears quarterback Jim McMahon, a party to the suit, developed an addiction after medical staff gave him painkillers without getting prescriptions, keeping records or warning about side effects.

His dependency is so strong that McMahon downs more than 100 pills of Percocet, an opioid pain medication, according to the lawsuit. 

A former teammate of McMahon, offensive lineman Keith Van Horne, sparked the ire of Bears' trainer Fred Caito after he was prescribed Percodan by a doctor not affiliated with the team.

'The problem was that the Bears ordered painkillers in advance of every season under a player’s name,' the suit reads. 

'Van Horne had thus put Caito in a bad spot by obtaining the Percodan when there were already DEA records that hundreds of painkillers had been ordered in Van Horne’s name.'

Other former players reported chronic muscle and bone ailments or claimed that they had nerve and organ damage related to prescription drug use, though the link is not definitive.

In September, former NFL quarterback Ryan Leaf was sentenced to five years in prison after breaking into an acquaintance's home and stealing prescription painkillers in violation of probation.

The once highly touted college talent who flopped in the pros developed an addiction to painkillers that earlier landed him in rehab, according to ESPN.

The controlled substance act lays out rules that puts the distribution of prescription drugs in the hands of licensed doctors and nurses. It also outlines strict requirements for obtaining, storing and transporting drugs.
