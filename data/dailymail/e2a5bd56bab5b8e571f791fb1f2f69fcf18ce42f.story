A painting by a talented British artist with Down's Syndrome has been given the royal seal of approval.

Tazia Fawley, 43, from Highbridge, Somerset, donated the brightly-coloured work to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge as a personal gift to mark the arrival of their son, Prince George.

She spent six months working on the painting which features hot air balloons over Bristol’s Clifton Suspension Bridge and children's favourite Rupert the Bear.

Gift: Tazia Fawley holding a copy on the painting she has given to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge for Prince George's nursery

Tazia's painting: Called Rupert Flies Over the Clifton Suspension Bridge, it is an acrylic on wood painting worth around £2,000

It was first spotted by the Heart and Sold charity which supports and showcases artists with Down’s Syndrome and they offered it to St James's Palace.

To Tazia's joy, the royal couple said they were delighted to accept the 3ft x 1ft painting and sent her their best wishes.

Tazia, who has been painting for 14 years, said the acrylic on wood painting was worth around £2,000 - but she was happy to donate it free.

She said: 'The painting is of the Bristol Balloon Festival and it's one of my favourite pieces of work.

'I gave it to Kate and Wills as a present, because they seem like good people and they wanted to bring some colour into their son's nursery.

'I'm so excited to know that my painting will be seen by the most famous baby in the world.'

Suzie Moffat from Heart and Sold said: 'I contacted the palace before the Prince was born to see if they would like Tazia's art for the baby's nursery.

Inspiring: Tazia lives with her mother Glyda, who hopes that her daughter's paintings will help change attitudes about what people with Down's Syndrome can achieve

Cornish Sea Scape: Tazia loves painting landscapes and capturing the vibrant colours

'I was thrilled when the Palace replied saying that they'd love the artwork so we sent it over to them.

'They were extremely positive towards the artwork and were very supportive of the charity which was brilliant. Kate and Wills even sent us a thank you note.

'It's such a lovely piece, and Tazia is such a great artist.'

The letter sent to proud Tazia says: 'The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge request to send best wishes to Suzie Moffat and Tazia Fawley for their generous gift.'

Tazia lives with her mother, Gylda, in Somerset and works from a studio in their back garden.

She added: 'I mostly paint landscapes and seascapes because I find painting people a bit difficult. Animals and buildings are also hard. I struggle a bit with those too.

'But I love painting landscapes. The colours you can use are just phenomenal.

Tazia says: 'I don't see myself as a Down's Syndrome artist, I see myself as an artist who just happens to have Down's'

'I don't really have any favourite artists, I just like painting what I like painting, and that's about it.

'I'm not trying to copy anyone else, I paint because I love it and it makes me very happy.'

Tazia's mother Gylda, 74, who is a sculptor, said: 'If a person with a child with Down's sees her work, they can take a big positive from it.

'It can give them a much more positive outlook because their child may be able to do the same thing.

'When Taz was born, doctors dealt with children with Down's by telling parents what their limitations were.

Talented: Tazia has been painting for 14 years and works out of a garden studio at her home in Somerset

Grateful: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge sent a note thanking Tazia for the painting, which was a gift to celebrate the arrival of Prince George

'It was always what they can't do, rather than now, where doctors tell parents what their child can do.

'Hopefully Taz's work can change a few attitudes about what a dedicated person with Down's can do.'

Tazia often listens to pop music when she paints, because she says it helps her come up with brighter colour combinations.

She said: 'When I was painting the prince's painting, I was listening to a lot of Abba, Kylie and even Queen. Happy music makes happy paintings. I try to be quite positive and happy all the time, and not moody.

'I don't see myself as a Down's Syndrome artist, I see myself as an artist who just happens to have Down's.'
