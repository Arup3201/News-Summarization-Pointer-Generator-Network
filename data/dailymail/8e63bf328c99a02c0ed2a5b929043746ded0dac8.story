Sportsmail analyses what we learned from the third round of the FA Cup as the Premier League sides entered the famous old tournament.

1. Arsenal’s injury woes have handed Francis Coquelin a chance to prove his worth. Despite first signing for the Gunners in 2008, the FA Cup tie with Hull was the first time the French midfielder had ever started three games in a row.

The 23-year-old did well enough in the holding role to suggest he’ll play some more while Arsene Wenger tries to get other midfielders fit.

But Coquelin will be glad the January 1 disciplinary deadline for five bookings earning a suspension has come and gone. His yellow card in the 2-0 win was his fourth in as many appearances.

2. Petr Cech might be consigned to spending most games on the bench but he remains a top-class deputy for Chelsea’s rising star Thibaut Courtois.

Cech made six saves against Watford to make sure Jose Mourinho’s side could keep their quest for four trophies rolling forward.

The 32-year-old, now certain to stay at Stamford Bridge for the rest of the season following Mark Schwarzer’s move to Leicester, has let in just five goals in his nine appearances.

3. Stoke’s Ryan Shawcross and Sunderland’s John O’Shea seem to be exempt from the rotation policies that affect every other Premier League footballer.

While others were rested, both were on FA Cup duty for their clubs against Wrexham and Leeds respectively.

They are now the only two outfield players in the top flight to have appeared in every minute of every game in every competition so far this season.

4. One of the jobs on the in tray for Tony Pulis is to find a way of keeping Victor Anichebe fit. The former Everton striker proved he could be the sort of powerhouse front man that West Brom’s new manager likes when he muscled his way to score the second of Albion’s seven against Gateshead. 

The Nigeria international had a hernia operation at the start of the season and has had a series of niggling problems since recovering.

Pulis had a record at Stoke of helping players who had struggled with long-term injuries to overcome their problems and 26-year-old Anichebe will be hoping he can work his magic again.

5. Adam King is the latest Swansea player to benefit from the club’s policy of showing patience with young players.

The 19-year-old finally got to make his debut in the Cup win at Tranmere some 12 months since his £200,000 transfer from Hearts.

Boss Garry Monk believes the former Scotland youth international midfielder has benefited from time learning his side’s passing style of football and could break into the Premier League team before the season is over.

6. QPR goalkeeper Rob Green can sleep easy after his understudy Alex McCarthy’s hapless display in the embarrassing 3-0 defeat at home to League One Sheffield United.

Highly rated former England Under 21 star McCarthy had been bought from Reading for a fee believed to be around £2million because Harry Redknapp wanted to put pressure on his 34-year-old No 1.

But McCarthy’s two games so far have been a disappointment – he also let in three when he made his Premier League debut at home to Liverpool.

7. Alan Pardew might have the answer to finding more goals for Crystal Palace already under his nose in the shape of former part-timer Dwight Gayle.

The 25-year-old, who was signed by Ian Holloway from Peterborough for a £4.5m fee two summers ago, hasn’t had much in the way of game time under Neil Warnock’s management.

But his goal in the 4-0 win at Dover was his seventh in a total of 698 minutes on the pitch – working out at a goal every 99 minutes.

8. Championship leaders Bournemouth have more depth in their squad than they are being given credit for by many experts who still don’t believe they will stay the promotion course.

Manager Eddie Howe made eight changes to his regular team for the trip to Rotherham but still had enough quality to roll over another Championship side 5-1.

French striker Yann Kermorgant scored two of the goals and made two more.

9. Chris O’Grady appeared to have no future at Brighton after getting farmed out on loan to Sheffield United last month with a view to a permanent move.

But new boss Chris Hughton might be tempted to change those plans after recalling the much travelled 28-year-old striker early and then seeing him score one of the goals in a 2-0 win at Brentford.

Hughton now plans to give the burly 6ft 1in forward a fresh chance to prove he can be a success at the Amex Stadium.

10. There were eyebrows raised at Tottenham last summer when promising young defender Kevin Stewart was released on a free and immediately snapped up by Liverpool on a two-year deal.

The 21-year-old, who has been progressing steadily behind the scenes at Anfield, has now moved to Cheltenham on loan and scored one of the goals in a 2-1 win at Oxford.

Stewart is one of three Anfield hopefuls who have signed temporary forms for the League Two club’s new boss Paul Buckle. Midfielder Jack Dunn, 20, also scored on his debut and defender Lloyd Jones gave a polished performance too.
