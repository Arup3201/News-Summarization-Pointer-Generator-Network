They say Britannia rules the waves but this photograph shows it rules the skies too.

Clouds gathered in the shape of the United Kingdom the day after the future king Prince George was born.

The formation was captured by 
23-year-old Amy Abrams, who pulled over to take a photograph on her 
iPhone after spotting the unusual clouds while driving with her mother.

Lucky: Amy Abrams spotted the unusual cloud formation above Coventry

The shape stayed in the skies above Coundon, in Coventry, for around a minute before drifting apart.

The education assistant, who works at Coventry Transport Museum, posted the image on Twitter, describing it as 'Coventry's little present for the new Prince perhaps'.

Miss Abrams had been in the car when she saw the cloud shape at around 2.30pm on July 23.

She said: 'It was like a gift from the Gods. I think it was very fitting considered that we had just been blessed with a future king of the country.

'I had to do a double take when I saw it, I thought that looks amazing.

'I couldnâ€™t believe it and my friends and family really love the picture.

'It made me quite proud to be British.'
