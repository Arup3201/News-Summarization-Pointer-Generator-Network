Mr Abbott then turned to thank someone else in the crowd before turning returning his attention back to Mr Shorten.

He drew a deep breath as he appeared to think of something else to say.

Mr Shorten made a comment, causing a brief chuckle from the PM before Mr Abbott made his excuse to leave.

'Alright well I'm vanishing, I'll see you later on,' he told the group gathered around him.

Mr Abbott was wearing his traditional blue tie but both leaders wore the teal ribbon in honour of Teal Ribbon Day which aims to raise awareness for the 1400 women who will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer this year alone.
