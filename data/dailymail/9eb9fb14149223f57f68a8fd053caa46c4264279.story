The exiled political leader of Hamas Khaled Meshaal kissed the ground as he returned to the Gaza Strip today for the first time since he left the West Bank 45 years ago.

He was forced to leave the West Bank for Kuwait following the Six Day War in 1967 aged just 11.

His visit comes after days of bloody conflict between Israel and the Palestinians ended in a ceasefire.

In a move that underscored the Islamist group's growing confidence, Mr Meshaal declared the moment is 'third birth'.

Mr Meshaal considers his 'second birth' the moment he survived an assassination attempt in Jordan in 1997 and his 'first birth' his actual birth in 1956.

He became Hamas's political leader in exile after the assassination of Sheikh Yassin by Israel in 2004.

In a statement to the media he said: 'I consider this moment my third birth, and I pray to God that my fourth birth will be the moment when all of Palestine is liberated. Gaza has always been in my heart.'

During a three-day trip, he is expected to visit the home of military commander Ahmed Jabari, whose death sparked the offensive last month.

A huge rally is set to be held tomorrow to mark the 25th anniversary of Hamas and 'victory' in the recent conflict with Israel.

Hamas, considered a terrorist organisation by the US and the EU, has governed the Palestinian Territories since 2007.

Growing confidence: Mr Meshaal's visit is seen by political commentators as a sign of increasing belief by Hamas leaders that the party is gaining international legitimacy

Mr Meshaal is expected to address the ongoing negotiations with the rival Fatah movement to form a national government of unity in the Palestinian Territories.

Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who rules the West Bank since Hamas forced out the faction in 2007, endorsed a plan to reconcile the factions last year.

Mr Meshaal told Reuters ahead of his Gaza visit that 'there is a new mood that allows us to achieve reconciliation'.

Hamas feels it has growing international support following the eight-day war with Israel which left 170 Palestinians and six Israelis dead.

Mr Meshaal, who helped negotiated the ceasefire, believes his position has been strengthened by the involvement of the US and Egypt.Â 

'Israel always violates agreements 
but Israel will be condemned if it doesn't abide by this written 
agreement under Egyptian sponsorship and US presence,' he told Reuters 
last week.

'The world witnessed it,' he said.

Armed men lined up in Gaza today to greet the 56-year-old whose ear was injected with 
poison by Mossad agents in Amman in 1997 before Jordan made Israel hand 
over the antidote.

Mouin Rabbani, an expert on Palestinian affairs, said: 'It is a very welcome poke in the eye of Israel.

'It is a significant visit that shows Israel's position in Gaza has further weakened to the extent that the leader of the organisation it went to war with last month and it tried to murder can now visit Gaza with the trappings of an official visit.'
