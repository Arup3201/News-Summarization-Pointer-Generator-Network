Gone: Three Army instructors have been sacked amid allegations cadets where physically abused at a camp. This is a file picture of cadets

Three Army instructors have been sacked amid allegations cadets where physically abused at a camp.

It’s alleged teenagers from Merseyside where bullied, hurt and humiliated at the national cadet camp in Crowborough, Sussex.

Police, Army and council officials are investigating claims that recruits were whipped and tied up as part of a catalogue of abuse.

It’s claimed cadets - aged between 15 
and 17 - were struck with elastic cords, forced to walk across rubble on
their bare knees and had water poured over them.

Disturbing
photos have emerged which allegedly show one a female recruit with 
extensive bruising to her legs caused by her being repeatedly struck 
with a bungee cord.

The probe centres on the Merseyside Army Cadet Force (MACF), based in Altcar, near Formby, Merseyside.

Three sergeant instructors were 
dismissed following complaints from cadets and their parents while 
another three sergeant instructors have been demoted in rank, the 
Liverpool Echo reported.

Files have been passed to child welfare officers at Sefton Council after a complaint to the NSPCC.

The allegations surround a trip to the camp in August involving around 400 young recruits from MACF, which has 34 detachments across Merseyside.

A source told the Liverpool Echo that recruits had been 'beasted'.

'The kids had been bullied, whipped, flicked with bungees, had water poured down their necks as punishment and were made to do stupid things,' the source added.

An Army spokesperson said they were aware of the claims.

He said: 'These have been investigated and action has been taken.

'All those who are found to fall short of the army’s high standards or who are found to have committed an offence under the Armed Forces Act are dealt with administratively (up to and including discharge) or through the discipline process, as appropriate.'

He added: 'The army takes duty of care very seriously. The wellbeing of our personnel remains fundamental to the core values and standards of the Armed Forces.

'The army has zero tolerance of bullying and all allegations are thoroughly investigated and action taken where necessary.

'Personnel have the right to live and work in an environment free from harassment, intimidation and discrimination (Armed Forces Diversity Policy).

'All personnel who feel they have been mistreated or bullied have the recourse to complain through the chain of command or direct to the RMP (Royal Military Police) or civilian police.

'Individuals may also speak to the padre, welfare staff or ring the confidential support line.

'All commanders are made fully aware of their responsibility to protect others from the differing forms of harassment, physical and mental intimidation and discrimination, and any suspicion of bullying should be dealt with immediately.

'This is reinforced throughout all military training.'

Sussex police confirmed a report of child cruelty was being looked into.

A spokesman said: 'On September 16, Sussex Police received a telephoned report alleging that army cadets from Merseyside had been assaulted whilst at Crowborough Army Camp in August this year.

'The matter has been looked into and we have liaised with Merseyside police.

'We have now just received one complaint of alleged assault on a teenage girl whilst she was at the camp.

'Full details in writing of this complaint are still awaited but it will be investigated, as would any other such complaints if received in the future.'

A spokesman for Sefton council said: 'We have recently been made aware of allegations which have been made anonymously via the NSPCC.'

The army cadets force is one of the country’s oldest and largest voluntary youth organisations. Cadets undertake community and military activities and work towards Duke of Edinburgh awards, BTEC and First Aid qualifications.

Cadets from around the UK attend the annual camp in Crowborough, with the aim to provide an extensive amount of training over ten days.

The Army cadet website says: 'With such a large attendance of both adults and cadets, annual camp is an ideal opportunity to recognise achievements gained not only during the 10 day camp but some may have been achieved prior to going away.

'This is a great way for fellow cadets and adults to see what they cadets from across the county are achieving and aims to motivate other cadets to follow suit.

'These achievements are not only something that benefit the cadet whilst they serve with the ACF but can build confidence, motivation and leadership skills that can be used beyond their cadet years.'
