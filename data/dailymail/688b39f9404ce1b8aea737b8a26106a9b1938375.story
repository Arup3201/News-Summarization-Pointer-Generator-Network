Japan has delayed the launch of its space probe for the second time due to bad weather.

The Hayabusa2 will now blast off on a six-year mission to mine a distant asteroid aboard Japan's main H-IIA rocket from Tanegashima Space Center in south of the country on Wednesday at 1.22 pm local time.

The probe was originally scheduled to launch today but Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) postponed it to Monday after a forecast of thick clouds.

Hayabusa2 had been set to blast off aboard the H-IIA rocket, pictured, from Tanegashima Space Center in southern Japan today but the launch was postponed for the second time due to bad weather

The agency said it decided on the second postponement due to fears of strong winds, and warned that the launch could be delayed further depending on the weather. 

The 31 billion yen ($260 million) project will send the explorer towards the 1999JU3 asteroid in deep space.

It will blast a crater in the asteroid to collect materials unexposed to millennia of wind and radiation, in the hope of answering some fundamental questions about life and the universe.

Hayabusa2 will take off only weeks after a European spacecraft's historic landing on a comet captivated the world's attention.

The probe, which is about the size of a domestic refrigerator, is expected to reach the asteroid in mid-2018 and spend around 18 months near it.

It will also study the surface by dropping tiny robots and if all goes well, asteroid samples will be returned to Earth in late 2020.

The Hayabusa2 mission will blast off just weeks after the European Space Agency succeeded in making mankind's first ever landing on a comet this month.

Scientists said initial data sent from the robot lab Philae showed traces of organic molecules and a surface much harder than imagined.

Philae, released from its mothership Rosetta, has gone into hibernation on the comet, having used its onboard battery power after 60 hours of prodding and probing.
