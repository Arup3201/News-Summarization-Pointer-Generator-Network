Boast: Aides to Culture Secretary Maria Miller highlighted her children ahead of an internet porn summit

Maria Miller has been criticised for claiming she understands the need for internet porn controls because she is the ‘only mother at the Cabinet table’.

The Culture Secretary’s aide made the comment ahead of yesterday’s Whitehall summit on the issue. Mrs Miller, who is married with three children, said at the weekend: ‘As a mother, I am determined to protect my children from the depravity of internet porn.’

The Cabinet’s other women – Home Secretary Theresa May, Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers and International Development Secretary Justine Greening – have no children.

Labour’s media spokesman Helen Goodman said it was a ‘foolish’ choice of words. She added: ‘The job of Secretary of State is to stand up to the industry, not to start talking about her personality and family situation.’

Mrs Miller today hosted a summit in Parliament with senior figures from internet, communications and computing firms including Google, Microsoft and BT.

The meeting agreed a new approach to tackling online child abuse images with a beefed-up role for the internet watchdog.

Mrs Miller said they had agreed a ‘fundamental change’ to the way the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) works, with the industry-funded body set to adopt a role actively seeking out and blocking child pornography.

The main UK internet service providers (ISPs) have agreed to provide extra funding for the IWF, understood to amount to £1 million, to help it take on the extra duties.

Under current arrangements the IWF only acts on content that has been reported to it rather than proactively seeking out illegal images.

Representatives from Yahoo!, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Facebook, BT, Sky, Virgin Media, TalkTalk, Vodafone, O2, EE and Three were summoned to the meeting.

The Culture Secretary said illegal child abuse images had caused concerns ‘particularly in recent months’.

The parents of murdered children April Jones and Tia Sharp have called for more action to tackle child porn on the internet as the Government and technology giants agreed a new crackdown.

In interviews with Channel 5 News, five-year-old April's parents Paul and Coral Jones and 12-year-old Tia's father Steven Carter both agreed their children's killers were spurred on by sick images found online.

Mark Bridger, who killed April in Mid-Wales, and Stuart Hazell, murderer of Tia in south London, were both found to have accessed child and violent pornography and some experts argue there is a clear link between their obsessions and their actions.

Mr and Mrs Jones told Channel 5 News that they want Prime Minister David Cameron to get personally involved in the fight against child abuse online. 

Mrs Jones said: 'April was a fighter from the word go and I promised her I'll do this for her."I said I'll help other children, so their family don't have to go through this, their brothers and sisters.

'It's not just us it affects, it affects brothers and sisters as well.

'I just want it stopped and I think the Government should put more pressure and get it done now.'

Mr Clark has told Channel 5 News that stopping indecent images of children from being published online could have saved his daughter Tia, who was brutally murdered by Stuart Hazell.

He said: 'You're fuelling the beast and it needs to be stopped, it should have been stopped a long time ago when these people were setting up companies they should be looking at, right, what would be the outcome of indecent images of children?'

Mark Bridger, who killed April Jones, 
and Stuart Hazell, murderer of Tia Sharp, were both found to have 
accessed child and violent pornography and some experts argue there is a
clear link between their obsessions and their actions.

Mrs
Miller added: ‘I think any parent or anybody who is a resident in this 
country wants to see illegal child abuse images dealt with, and dealt 
with swiftly.’

But aides to the minister last night actively highlighted the fact that she is the ‘only mother in the Cabinet’.

Helen
Goodman, Labour’s shadow media minister, said: ‘I think that was 
foolish. It would be much better to come to Parliament and say this is 
what we are thinking than briefing that you are the only mother in the 
Cabinet. I don’t think we care about that.'

Ms Goodman claimed the package agree was a 'damp squib'. She added: 'The job of Secretary of State is to stand up to the industry not to start talking about her personality and family situation.

‘We are not interested in how much people care. We are interested in how effective they are. There is not caring and wringing your hands if you don’t make some change.’

She added that it was ‘really shocking’ that Mr Cameron only had one mother in Cabinet.

The remark risks being seen as insensitive towards her Cabinet colleagues.

Home Secretary Theresa May, the most 
senior woman in British politics, last year revealed her sense of loss 
at not being a mother.

She said: ‘It just didn’t happen. I mean, this isn’t something I generally go into, but things just turned out as they did.

‘You look at families all the time and you see there is something there that you don’t have,’ she told the Daily Telegraph.

Other Cabinet ministers without children include Justine Greening, Eric Pickles and William Hague.

In 2010 Mr Hague revealed how his wife Ffion has suffered ‘multiple miscarriages’.

He said: ‘I have made no secret of the fact that Ffion and I would love to start a family.

‘For many years this has been our goal. Sadly this has proved more difficult for us than for most couples.’

It was also noted that Faith minister Baroness Warsi, who attends Cabinet but is not a full member, has a daughter.

A Tory colleague said: ‘Maria has been briefed against and is probably defending herself from the recent continuous background attacks.

‘However her language was a little bit sloppy, protecting vulnerable people and enhancing online safety measures is a matter for all policy makers, whether they are a mother, father, grandparent, aunt uncles or simply a constituency MP.’
