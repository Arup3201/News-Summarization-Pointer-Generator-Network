A 'hitman' has been arrested in Peru - after advertising himself as a contract killer on his Facebook profile.

Jonathan Giraldo, 38, gave himself the alias 'Tony Garcia' and nicknamed himself 'Anthrax' thinking it would help conceal his identity.

But police swooped after he used real videos and photos of himself posing with weapons - including a handgun with a silencer attachment - and bundles of cash.

In his profile for his professional background, Giraldo - who called himself the 'Most Wanted' - said: 'On the streets - you learn more than in school.'

But police then tracked him to his apartment in Miraflores, a district in Peru's Lima province.

Officers arrested him while he was updating his profile with more claims of his criminal escapades.

Police spokesman Leonidas Menendez said: 'At the moment he is being held on firearms offences.'

He added: 'The truth of it is at the moment we do not know yet if he really is a contract killer or if he is an idiot making up a fantasy life from his bedroom but we will find out the truth.

'We are currently doing ballistics checks on the weapons and looking at his bank accounts to see if there have been any suspicious payments.'
