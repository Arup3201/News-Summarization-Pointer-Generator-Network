It's a massive week in the Champions League as the final round of group stage fixtures are played and the last 16 line-up confirmed.

While some groups are settled, there's plenty to play for in others and some big names staring at elimination.

Ahead of Wednesday's fixtures, we take you through the permutations and possibilities for each of the final four groups.

GROUP E

Bayern Munich are guaranteed top spot in this group, while the other three teams all have a chance of joining them in the knockout phase.

Manchester City will go through if they beat Roma in Italy and CSKA Moscow fail to beat Bayern in Germany.

If CSKA lose, City can also advance with a score draw because of their superior goal difference to Roma.

However, if both matches end in a draw, Roma are the ones who go through.

CSKA can advance if they beat Bayern and Roma fail to beat City. If both CSKA and City win, the Russians advance by virtue of their superior head-to-head record over the Premier League champions.

GROUP F

Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain are both comfortably through and they meet at the Nou Camp to decide who'll top the group.

A win or draw will see the French champions finish first. If Barcelona win, they will finish top.

Ajax will ensure Europa League football after Christmas if they win or draw against APOEL in Amsterdam. A defeat, however, will see the Cypriots through in their place.

GROUP G

Chelsea's 5-0 win at Schalke on matchday five ensured they will top the group.

In order to join them, the Germans must beat Maribor and hope Sporting Lisbon lose at Stamford Bridge.

If Schalke win and Sporting draw, the Portuguese side advance because of their superior head-to-head record.

Maribor could pounce and gain the Europa League spot if they beat Schalke.

GROUP H

Porto will definitely finish top and Shakhtar Donetsk have second place sewn up in this pool.

So it's between Athletic Bilbao and BATE Borisov for the Europa League spot. The Spanish side need a win or a draw but a defeat would leave BATE third.
