Someone has run up the white flag on one of New York City's most famous landmarks.

Commuters on Tuesday morning were greeted with a pair of billowing white banners atop the Brooklyn Bridge after vandals stole Old Glory and replaced them with ones that had been bleached.

The flags appeared to have faint traces of stars and stripes on it. It was revealed this afternoon that the flags were defaced by vandals who bleached  them.

The vandals tacked aluminum covers on to the lights that illuminated that flags, so that the top of the bridge towers looked dark. As a result, the white flags were not discovered until daybreak.

EarthCam video of the bridge shows that the first tower went dark about 3.35am. The second tower went dark seven minutes later, indicating the heist was at least a two-person job.

Surrender? A vandal replaced the American flags atop the Brooklyn Bridge with white banners on Tuesday - the international symbol for surrender

No one knows why or how the flags were hoisted above the Brooklyn Bridge. Officials called it a major security breach

So far, the NYPD has no clue who is 
behind the flags or why they were hoisted above the bridge - though they
 don't believe it has any connection to terrorism or politics.

'This
 may be somebody's art project, or it may be an attempt at a 
statement,' John Miller, Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence of the 
NYPD, said this afternoon.

Several officers scaled the bridge and were seen lowering the flag on the Manhattan side around 11am as traffic inched along the bridge.

The bridge is one of the most heavily secured landmarks in the city, constantly monitored by surveillance cameras. Police patrol cars are also stationed at both ends of the bridge.

Detectives are reviewing security footage in an attempt to determine who put up the white flags - and how they gained access to the span.

The support towers are 273-feet tall and it's unknown how the thieves managed to climb them without anyone noticing.

Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams blasted the vandals who took the American flags.

By 3.42am, the lights above both towers on the Brooklyn Bridge were out

By 11am, NYPD officers had taken down the white flags. They were later replaced with new American flags

They promptly hoisted up an American flag - atop the bridge - replacing the Old Glory that was stolen from the New York icon

It's unclear how the vandals slipped past the police officers and security cameras guarding the bridge

'If flying a white flag atop the Brooklyn Bridge is someone’s idea of a joke, I’m not laughing,' he told the New York Post.

'The public safety of our city is of paramount importance, particularly our landmarks and bridges that are already known to be high-risk targets. We will not surrender our public safety to anyone, at any time.'

In April, New York artist Brendan Fagan - aka Justin Supine - scaled the Ed Koch-Queensboro Bridge and planted an art installation at the top. He was later arrested and charged with reckless endangerment and criminal trespass.
