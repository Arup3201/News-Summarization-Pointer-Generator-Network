A once magnificent Art Deco cinema opened during the glory days of the silver screen is now a crumbling wreck which hasn't shown a film for 50 years.

The Royalty Cinema in Harborne, Birmingham, was designed by celebrated picture house architect Horace G Bradley during the first great wave of cinema building and opened on 20th October, 1930.

Excited cinema-goers queued to take their seats in the state-of-the-art new theatre to catch a showing of The Love Parade starring French actor Maurice Chevalier.

But as Britain's celluloid love affair stalled, the theatre soon fell into disrepair, and now stands empty.

In its prime film fans queued round the block to view pictures following the cinema's opening in 1930. When film showings stopped, it was used as a bingo hall, but even sessions of the popular game stopped in 2010 (pictured)

It boasts richly decorated and boldly coloured arches that scale the entire walls on either side of the stage. Cinema seats still remain on the upper level complete with ashtrays in the backs of chairs and spider webs spun across rows

Fast forward 85 years and while the theatre retains its original Art Deco features, today an Eastern European car wash operates on the car park of the cinema, whilst inside paint is peeling from the ceilings and walls as the old building crumbles.

In 2012 a cannabis farm was found in the attic after police noticed a suspicious smell and spotted unusual behaviour at the building. 

The auditorium is a cavernous split-level room that despite being unused for many years is still very impressive.

Margaret Ashton, 65, went to the cinema when she was a little girl.

Mrs Ashton said: 'I remember being very excited going to the cinema, it was always a special treat.

'But I know it much better as a Bingo hall, I've been there plenty of times.

Stained glass with a crown on gives a small indication of the building's former glory. It was once considered to be one of the finest examples of the work of the renowned Birmingham theatre architect, and could accommodate almost 1,500 patrons

ABC closed the cinema on the 2nd of November, 1963 and was converted into a Bingo Club, which has operated periodically up until 2010

'It's a shame the state that it's in now because it really is a beautiful building and they certainly don't make cinemas like that anymore.

'It'd be wonderful to see it restored to something Harborne could be proud of again.'
