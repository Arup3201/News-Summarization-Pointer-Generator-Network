Lying in the shadow of Westminster, the exclusive Dolphin Square estate has been home to politicians, foreign dignitaries, spies and escorts.

Now detectives are probing claims that the prestigious Pimlico block was also the site of sordid 'sex parties' involving the horrific, violent abuse of young children.

Hosted by MPs, spy chiefs and senior figures in the military and law enforcement, the parties allegedly saw youths – mainly boys – 'shared' among paedophiles.

One victim, who alleges two well-known Tory politicians raped and physically beat him, recalls being taken to the famous square around ten times from the age of 11.

He says he was raped while his head was held underwater in a bath by a 'sadistic' former Cabinet minister, while a second former MP cut boys with a knife. Another of the abusers, known as the Doctor, is said to have treated any injuries.

The victim, known only as Nick, described how chauffeur-driven cars would pick up boys from school and drop them off at apartments, where they were plied with whiskey before being subjected to unspeakable acts.

'Some of [the abusers] were quite open about who they were,' he said. 'They had no fear at all of being caught, it didn't cross their mind.'

Earlier this month, Nick told investigative website Exaro that a shamed top diplomat and MI6 chief was among the group who raped him.

Exaro said the victim had picked out a photo of Sir Peter Hayman as one of his abusers at Dolphin Square.

Hayman was caught with paedophile literature in 1978 and fined for gross indecency in 1984. He was a key member of the Paedophile Information Exchange, a vile pressure group that advocated legalising sex between adults and children.

The spy chief, who died in 1992 aged 78, had been a pillar of the Establishment. He held a number of top jobs at the Home Office, Foreign Office, Ministry of Defence and even Nato.

A number of witnesses have claimed they were between 11 and 13 when they were first taken to parties at the riverside block

Nick, who is now in his 40s, said his ordeal suddenly came to an end when he went to a pre-arranged place to be picked up by a driver and no-one arrived.

He has given the names of those he believes were involved in the abuse ring to the police and the BBC, in the hope of encouraging others to come forward.

A number of witnesses have claimed they were between 11 and 13 when they were first taken to parties at the riverside block, which houses 1,250 flats and is just a short walk from the House of Commons.

At one point, Dolphin Square was home to up to 70 MPs and around 10 lords. 

Former inhabitants include Harold Wilson, David Steel and William Hague – although none of them are suspected of any wrongdoing. Call girls Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies, who earned infamy for their involvement in the Profumo affair, were both sub-tenants.

Ian Fleming's spy chief 'M' was partially based on Maxwell Knight, a senior intelligence figure who was another long-term resident. Number 308 Hood House was reportedly used by an MI5 group aiming to infiltrate potentially subversive groups from 1924 to 1946.

The square was also home to Oswald Mosley, the founder of the British Union of Fascists, who lived there with his wife, Mitford sister Diana, until he was jailed in 1940. 'Lord Haw-Haw' William Joyce, the Second World War German propagandist, also lived there before he was executed for treason.

It is rumoured that agents from both sides of the Iron Curtain lived there too. In 1962 tenant John Vassall, an Admiralty clerk, was exposed as a Soviet spy.
