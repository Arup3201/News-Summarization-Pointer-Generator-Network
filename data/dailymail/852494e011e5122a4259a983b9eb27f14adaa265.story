Tough new laws introduced to help ASIO and Australian Federal Police stop would-be terrorists from leaving the country and  joining terror groups overseas are set to be watered down.

A review of the Federal Government's proposed counter-terror measures has recommended the bill be passed but also found many of the changes too tough and the committee has put forward 36 recommended changes. 

Among them, restricting the ability of Attorney-General George Brandis to declare certain country's a 'no-go zone' because of terror links.

Among key changes called for by the bipartisan committee is restricting the Attorney-General George Brandis from declaring any country a 'no-go zone' because of perceived terror links

 Attorney-General George Brandis says the government is considering its recommendations but wants its counter-terrorism measures passed in the next two weeks.

'This is urgent legislation which deals with a clear and immediate threat for the safety of the Australian public,' Senator Brandis said.

The crime of 'entering, or remaining in, a declared area' should also expire two years after the federal election, rather than in 10 years as proposed in the bill. 

The report also urges the government to water down its plans to extend preventative detention orders, control orders and stop search and seizure powers for terrorist suspects.

They should expire in 2018 rather than the proposed 10 years, it says.

 The committee also said that it 'examined whether the Bill incorporates adequate safeguards and accountability mechanisms to ensure the proper application of the laws into the future and whether the Bill is drafted in a way to avoid any foreseeable unintended consequences'.

It has called the legislation 'complex' and wants a longer public consultation period.  

The bill includes a planned increase to the 'Stop, Search and Seizure powers' in the Crimes Act relating to terrorism offences, such as linking with terror groups such as Islamic State, for a 10 year period but the committee wants it be reduced to 24 months post the next federal poll

One of the key element of this second part of new terror laws was the government having the ability to declare a terrorist hot spot a 'no go zone' making it potentially a crime to travel there.

Whole countries should not be declared terrorist zones only particular regions, the committee said.

The government has responded, with the Prime Minister confirming it would consider seriously the recommendations.

'I am confident that the recommendations of this committee will be serious and we will take them seriously,' Tony Abbott said.

'I am confident that the recommendations of this committee will be serious and we will take them seriously,' Tony Abbott said

He said had a lot of faith in the committee's work.

Human rights and Islamic groups have written to the Attorney-General calling on the government to slow the introduction of the new measures.

They say the laws will restrict personal freedom and aren't needed to crack down on home-grown extremists.

The government wants the laws passed in the next couple of weeks.

'Given the nature of these powers, it is important that their use and ongoing need is assessed within a reasonable timeframe,' the report says.

The preventative detention order allows police to detain a terrorism suspect for 14 days with the aim of preventing an imminent terrorist attack.

Privacy advocates are concerned about the bill's proposed expansion of biometric data collection, with the Department of Immigration to store more details of millions of Australians travelling in and out of the country.

The government wants to legislate for future collection of data such as fingerprints and iris scans, should technology improve.

But the committee wants that removed from the bill and 'given the sensitive nature of the data' recommends the government introduce it as separate legislation.

Despite supporting the bill, Labor is concerned the legislation is being rushed through and hasn't been properly analysed.

Australian Greens leader Christine Milne says Australians should be worried by the laws, which are an 'overreach' and impinge on the rights of ordinary people.
