A defiant head of the BBC yesterday defended the Corporation’s coverage of the police swoop on Sir Cliff Richard’s home despite receiving hundreds of complaints.

Lord Hall insisted the BBC had ‘acted appropriately’ when it broadcast live pictures of the singer’s home being raided as part of an investigation into an historic allegation of sexual abuse of a boy under 16.

The Corporation has faced an avalanche of criticism from leading lawyers, celebrities and politicians after a BBC helicopter beamed dramatic live footage of the search last week, including scenes of officers entering and leaving the singer’s home.

Bosses 
dispatched the helicopter to hover over Sir Cliff’s £3million home in 
Sunningdale, Berkshire and  stationed reporters at the gates before 
South Yorkshire Police had even arrived.

At the time, the 73-year-old star had not been aware of the raid and was on holiday in Portugal.

Veteran
 broadcaster Sir Michael Parkinson compared the reporting to a ‘witch 
hunt’, while human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson QC has questioned 
the legality of the raid.

The number of complaints by viewers has soared ten-fold from 77 last week to 762.

In
 the wake of the outcry, Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select 
Committee, wrote to the BBC and South Yorkshire Police demanding to know
 how the broadcaster found out in advance about the search last 
Thursday.

Yesterday,
 in a defiant response, Director General Lord Hall justified ‘extensive 
coverage’ of a ‘significant story’. He wrote in an open letter to Mr 
Vaz: ‘I believe that BBC journalists have acted appropriately in 
pursuing this story. As you rightly say, the media has a right to report
 on matters of public interest.

‘Sir
 Cliff Richard is one of the most successful British entertainers of all
 time and has been a prominent public figure for several decades.

‘Investigations
 into historic sex abuse cases have – and will continue to have – a 
profound impact on the lives of well-known individuals and the standing 
of public institutions.

‘The
 disclosure of a sex abuse allegation against Sir Cliff Richard and the 
police search of his property was clearly a significant story and the 
BBC was not alone in providing extensive coverage.’

On
 Saturday, South Yorkshire Police force revealed it had been contacted 
‘weeks ago’ by a BBC reporter who had found out about the investigation.
 It admitted striking a deal whereby the BBC would be given exclusive 
information in advance of the raid – allowing it to broadcast it live – 
‘in return for delaying publication’ of the story. Lord Hall refused to 
reveal who tipped off the BBC about the investigation into the claim, 
denied by Sir Cliff, that a boy was assaulted at a Christian rally in 
1985.

Of
 the viewer complaints, 297 relate to concerns about how the BBC found 
out about the police search, 208 said there was too much coverage, while
 186 said the BBC’s reporting had made Sir Cliff look guilty.

Another 71 felt the coverage was too intrusive and a waste of money.

Communications watchdog Ofcom has received 24 complaints about the BBC and one about coverage by ITV News.

Lord
 Hall refused to answer Mr Vaz’s questions about the original source of 
the story, except to reiterate it did not come from South Yorkshire 
Police. Separately, the force has written a letter of complaint to Lord 
Hall over an analysis piece on the BBC website that suggested ‘media 
presence at Sir Cliff’s property appeared to be an attempt by police to 
ensure maximum coverage’.

South
 Yorkshire Chief Constable David Crompton has until midday today to 
respond to a list of 12 questions from MPs about his handling of the 
investigation. The force said the police chief would not be making his 
response public.

Former
 policing minister Nick Herbert has suggested another force may have 
been responsible for the story. He added: ‘If that person provided 
information to the BBC for payment, then that is corruption.’

Thames
 Valley Police confirmed yesterday no member of staff was responsible 
for the leak. The Metropolitan Police, which was originally passed the 
allegation last year before handing it to South Yorkshire Police, 
refused to comment.

Former
 Home Secretary David Blunkett suggested the BBC had let police down, 
adding: ‘I am very sympathetic to the South Yorkshire Chief Constable’s 
disquiet given that their cooperation was on the basis of avoiding 
publicity prior to action taken.’

Sir
 Cliff yesterday pulled out of his annual visit to the US Open tennis 
championships. A spokesman said: ‘It is a decision he made of his own 
accord. Contrary to some reports, there would be no legal obstacles to 
him entering the US.'
