The BBC’s new director general is to cap redundancy and severance payments for senior managers at £150,000 following outrage over the huge exit deals given to bosses.

MPs have in recent months accused the broadcaster of ‘hosing down’ departing executives with cash and said that losing a well-paid job there was like ‘winning the lottery’.

There has been astonishment at the generous pay deals given to outgoing executives including former director general George Entwistle and former chief operating officer Caroline Thomson, who were given £450,000 and £670,000 respectively when they left their jobs last year.

Speaking at his first appearance before the influential culture media and sport select committee yesterday, new director general Tony Hall said he wanted to be sure the BBC was ‘in tune with the times’, saying the new cap was a ‘really important matter of principle’.

He also revealed that the proposed limit would affect about 250 people at the corporation, showing just how many executives had been signed up to generous deals at the broadcaster.

But critics have said that £150,000 pay-offs will still be seen as excessive by the public.

At the parliamentary hearing yesterday the BBC chairman Lord Patten also revealed he was prepared to rip up Lord Hall’s contract and give him a new one without the controversial gagging order, following controversy over the issue.

Lord Hall came under fire for the ‘cosy’ way he had appointed senior executives such as controversial former Labour culture secretary James Purnell without ‘open competition’. One MP accused him of appointing his ‘friends’.

Lord Patten also faced related accusations about the way he had appointed Mr Hall to the top job without a competitive recruitment process.

On the pay-off cap, the corporation will now have to ‘consult’ with the staff who are affected by the changes as it will have to change the terms of their contract.

The new proposals will entitle senior managers to one month’s redundancy pay for each year of service up to a maximum of 12 months’ salary or £150,000, whichever is lower.

All members of the corporation’s executive board will also have their notice period reduced from 12 months to 6 months.

When it was suggested there may be opposition to this from those involved, Mr Hall said emphatically he was ‘confident’ he would get their agreement.

Recent figures have revealed that as well as Mr Entwistle’s pay-off, 10 other executives received severance packages in recent years amounting to £4 million, with former deputy director-general Mark Byford being given £949,000.

Lord Hall said: ‘We cannot be tone deaf to what licence fee payers and the public out there have said to us about pay-offs for redundancies. 

‘So I have announced this morning that we will consult on a £150,000 cap on redundancy and severance payments to affect all senior management, old and new.

‘We have to deal with this problem, it wasn’t right the level of some payments, I hope that will deal with the problem clearly for the public.’

The BBC director general said the £150,000 cap was in line with the civil service.

Appearing alongside BBC chairman Lord Patten at the hearing, Mr Hall added: ‘We are consulting with staff and with the unions. We have to do that. It is a contractual change for senior managers and for other members of staff which we have to quite rightly consult on.’

In a message to BBC staff, Mr Hall said past settlements could ‘no longer be justified’.

During his opening remarks at the hearing Mr Hall said he wanted to make a ‘simpler BBC’ saying there ‘too much bureaucracy and too many processes’ and structures that ‘hinder’ programme makers.

His announcement on tackling huge pay-offs was welcomed last night.

Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘After George Entwistle’s obscene golden goodbye after just 54 days running the corporation, it was clearer than ever that the BBC needed to clamp down on these eye-watering pay-offs.

‘Lord Hall’s announcement is a long overdue acknowledgment that BBC bosses have for far too long been living on another planet. However, licence fee payers will still see a £150,000 pay-off as excessive.’The National Union of Journalists general secretary Michelle Stanistreet said: ‘This is a welcome development. These obscene payments were being paid while other members of the BBC were being forced out of their jobs.’

Lord Patten also faced related accusations about the way he had appointed Mr Hall to the top job without a competitive recruitment process

The new director general has made a string of appointments in recent weeks including former Times editor James Harding and former Labour cabinet minister James Purnell.

But he faced claims that the political ties of Mr Purnell were ‘unprecedented’ for a BBC executive and that executive salaries at the corporation were ‘plucked out of the air’.

Lord Hall said the former culture secretary was an ‘outstanding character’ and had ‘hung his boots up at the door and left politics behind’.

One MP, Conservative, Angie Bray, said the appointment ‘does sound a bit cosy’ and when Lord Hall said he believed in open competition, she interjected: ‘except when you have got some friends you can appoint.

It was pointed out to Lord Patten that his selection of Mr Hall was also done ‘without any open competition’.

Mr Hall, 62, who was made a cross-bench peer in 2010, was the only person contacted by the BBC Trust for the £450,000-a-year post.

Lord Patten told the committee that clauses in Lord Hall’s contract which prevent him from criticising the BBC during his time in office or within two years of his departure were ‘ceremonial’ and he did not expect them to be binding.

He said he would be ‘happy' to look again at the director-general’s contract and remove the gagging order.

Mr Hall said it would not prevent him from speaking out ‘if I felt something was wrong or if there was something I feel passionate about’.
