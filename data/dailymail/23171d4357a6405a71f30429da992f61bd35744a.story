About 20 911 calls poured into the Sacramento Police Department from shoppers inside, misreporting those gunshots being fired.

'I heard gun shots. It looked like you were in a war zone in like a fake movie,' one witness told KTXL.

Behind the chaos were at least 20 juveniles seen running around the mall, knocking over signs and pushing over other shoppers prompting the massive brawl, according to police.

When authorities arrived placing the facility on lockdown, the teens were said to have turned on the first arriving security officer before fleeing. Many were said to have blended into the crowds.

'All of a sudden there's like three 
different fights going on,' witness William Fewell told KTXL. 'And there
was one that was looking real bad where it was two people fighting one 
person and one got his head bashed against the counter pretty good.'

Calmed: The mall went on lock down as police secured the facilities, confirming no firearms present before reopening it less than an hour later

Reopening: Doors to this Macy's Department Store are seen being lifted after they, like the other stores, closed themselves while fearful of a gunman

'A woman fell down in Nordstrom’s and I don't know how she is now. She was down the whole time we were there. She didn't get back up,' another man told KTXL.

One woman has been confirmed injured during the stampede of people trying to escape.

She received medical attention after being knocked out.

All three suspects have been charged with fighting in a public place.

Less than an hour after the disturbance the mall reopened for business.

Santiago spoke to KCRA on Thursday after his release, along with O'Deal.

'I feel bad. I send out all my apologies, you feel me? To all those families out there, you feel me?  But it wasn’t my fault. I was just trying to do some shopping,' Santiago said.
