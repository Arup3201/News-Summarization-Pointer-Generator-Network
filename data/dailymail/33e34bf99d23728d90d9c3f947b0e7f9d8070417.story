Louis van Gaal is expected to be appointed as the new manager of Manchester United before next Wednesday, according to a Dutch football expert.

Thyce Sleggers was speaking on talkSPORT about the possible arrival of the Holland manager at Old Trafford.

And he claims that Van Gaal is keen to sign on at Old Trafford before the Dutch begin their 'first trials' for this summer's World Cup.

Imminent? Thyce Sleggers says Louis van Gaal will be appointed Manchester United manager in the next week

Preparations: Van Gaal has a World Cup to focus on with the Netherlands and won't want to be distracted

'It's not signed, but I expect it will be done before next Wednesday (first trial stage for World Cup),' Sleggers said. 'It must be done before he starts.'

'I know Van Gaal well and I'm sure he won't want to hear United's name after his preparations kick-off.'

With club captain Nemanja Vidic leaving for Inter Milan this summer, one key decision Van Gaal may have to make if given the role is deciding who should lead the team.

Wayne Rooney is the favourite to take on the armband, though Sleggers revealed that Van Gaal is much closer to United striker Robin van Persie - who he made Holland skipper - than first thought.

'Van Gaal and Van Persie are big friends. In the last month, they visited a few top Dutch league games, and next to him was Van Persie.

'The wives, Truus and Bouchra, shop together in London. The two families are truly getting along very well.'

Ryan Giggs is the current interim manager at United after David Moyes was sacked last week and led his team to a 4-0 win over Norwich in his first game in charge.

Carlo Ancelotti ruled himself out of the running on Tuesday before Real Madrid's 4-0 win over Bayern Munich.
