When you stop off at a service station on a motorway, you hardly expect five-star facilities. In fact the experience can often be somewhat traumatic.

But one tourist was very pleasantly surprised when he called in at a Shell garage in Bohol, the Philippines.

In fact, the toilets at this very unusual gas station were so top-notch that model and writer Jason Godfrey declared them better than his whole apartment.

The model films himself to present the bizarre toilet to viewers and uploaded it to his Facebook page, before posting it on YouTube - where it has received nearly two million views.

Introducing the unexpected find, Jason explains: 'I'm at a Shell station and I want to take you to a toilet here because the toilet at this Shell station is ridiculous.'

He adds: 'I never make videos really and post them but I had to make a video about this and it's about a toilet. Whatever.'

Jason Godfrey filmed a tour of the toilet as he couldn't believe the level of luxury at a gas station

The toilet looks more like a lounge, with magazines, books and framed pictures on the walls

Walking in through the unassuming door, Jason pans around the toilet to show mahogany panelling, table lamps, low lighting, bookshelves stacked with magazines and even shells and model boats on a mantlepiece.

Jason goes on to say: 'This is the shell toilet. Look at it!

'And I can't capture the smell but it's super menthol in here.'

As the camera shows the details of the bathroom - which looks more like a relaxing lounge - Jason adds: 'This toilet is better than my room, it's better than my entire toilet actually.'

Ornaments on the mantlepiece, toiletries and a huge mirror complete the look in the bathroom

And in case you were in any doubt, Jason shows that it is indeed a real toilet

He ends his update with the advice: 'So if you're looking for a toilet anywhere then try to find this Shell station. Crazy.'

Viewers posted comments about their surprise that such a clean gas station toilet could exist.

Mark Stewart said: 'I would totally go to that shell station. This is how you treat your customers right.'

Therese Eklund added: 'haha I thought that he was gonna show us the complete OPPOSITE, like a seriously dirty small toilet with a broken seat and poop on the walls or something LOL!'
