The mother of one of three Cub Scouts killed two decades ago in the West Memphis Three case today pushed for the long-running investigation to be reopened because of crucial new evidence.

Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley spent 18 years in jail accused of killing eight-year-old boys Steven Branch, Christopher Byers and Michael Moore in West Memphis, Arkansas.

Police labelled the 1993 murders ‘satanic’ because the children's naked bodies had been bound and mutilated. The three men were released in August after they were allowed to change their pleas.

The well-known case that attracted the attention of actor Johnny Depp is now the subject of the documentary ‘Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory’, which was nominated for an Academy Award this week.

The children's naked bodies had been bound and mutilated in the ‘satanic’ crime. But DNA tests did not link the men to the scene. It even showed others were there, who have never been identified.

The three men were released in August after a bargain in which they could continue to claim their innocence but pleaded guilty in exchange for an 18-year sentence and credit for time served.

‘I am content in my heart that Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley did not murder my son,’ Steven’s mother Pam Hobbs said. She wants investigators to look at new evidence.

Ms Hobbs wants them to look at Terry Hobbs, her ex-husband and the stepfather of Steven. Last week, lawyers for the West Memphis Three released polygraph tests from three new witnesses.

They say Terry Hobbs's nephew, Michael Hobbs Jr, told friends his uncle murdered the three boys. Echols's lawyers say this new information suggests Terry Hobbs’s relatives may have more details.

‘These three young witnesses are very willing to co-operate,’ Echols’s spokesman Lonnie Soury said.

Neither Terry Hobbs nor Michael Hobbs Jr. have yet commented. But Terry Hobbs said in August: ‘At every turn of the case there has never been one speck of evidence in me as a suspect.’

Scott Ellington, a prosecutor in Jonesboro, Arkansas, said in August that if new credible evidence was produced that he would be willing to re-examine the case, which now dates back 19 years.

He said on Tuesday that he had just received a packet from Echols's attorneys containing the new information. ‘I haven't had a chance to read through it all and digest it but I will,’ Mr Ellington said.

Some parents of the three murdered children just want the case to go away. Todd and Diana Moore, parents of Michael, claim that the ‘Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory’ film glorifies the West Memphis Three.

They asked the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to exclude the film, which is the third in an HBO series about the murders, from nomination consideration.

‘This film should be exposed as a fraud, not rewarded with an Academy Award nomination,’ Mr and Mrs Moore wrote in a letter to the Academy on Tuesday.

The case is also the subject of a second documentary, ‘West of Memphis.’ That film from ‘Lord of the Rings’ director Peter Jackson screened last week at the Sundance Film Festival in Utah.

When Echols, Baldwin and Misskelley were
 released from jail in August, they celebrated their first night of 
freedom in 18 years like 'five-year old kids at their first Christmas', 
one of their lawyers said.

For Echols, who spent half his life on death row, the release came almost out of the blue. He once came within three weeks of execution and has been relearning to live outside prison.

'I was up all morning and most of the night trying to figure out how to use those iPhone things,’ he said in August in the lobby of a posh Memphis hotel, just across the river from West Memphis.

Echols’s lawyer Steven Braga said his client celebrated with Baldwin and supporters in Memphis. ‘It was as if you could see two little five-year-old kids at their first Christmas,' he told CBS in August.
